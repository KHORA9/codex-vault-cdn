In the present edition very\r\nconsiderable alterations have been made, but the work of Dr. Giles remains\r\nthe basis of the translation. The Latin text used throughout is Mr.\r\nPlummer’s. Since the edition of Dr. Giles appeared in 1842, so much fresh\r\nwork on the subject has been done, and recent research has brought so many\r\nnew facts to light, that it has been found necessary to rewrite the notes\r\nalmost entirely, and to add a new introduction. After the appearance of\r\nMr. Plummer’s edition of the Historical Works of Bede, it might seem\r\nsuperfluous, for the present at least, to write any notes at all on the\r\n“Ecclesiastical History.” The present volume, however, is intended to\r\nfulfil a different and much humbler function. There has been no attempt at\r\nany original work, and no new theories are advanced. The object of the\r\nbook is merely to present in a short and convenient form the substance of\r\nthe views held by trustworthy authorities, and it is hoped that it may be\r\nfound useful by those students who have either no time or no inclination\r\nto deal with more important works.\r\n\r\nAmong the books of which most use has been made, are Mr. Plummer’s edition\r\nof the “Ecclesiastical History,” Messrs. Mayor and Lumby’s edition of\r\nBooks III and IV, Dr. Bright’s “Early English Church History,” and Dr.\r\nHunt’s “History of the English Church from its foundation to the Norman\r\nConquest.” Many of the articles in the “Dictionary of Christian Biography”\r\nand the “Dictionary of Christian Antiquities,” Dr. Mason’s “Mission of St.\r\nAugustine,” Dr. Rhŷs’s “Celtic Britain,” and a number of other books,\r\nmentioned in the notes, have been consulted.\r\n\r\nFor help received in different ways I wish to express my gratitude to\r\nvarious correspondents and friends. I am particularly indebted to Mr.\r\nEdward Bell, who has kindly revised my proofs and made many valuable\r\nsuggestions. For information on certain points I have to thank the Rev.\r\nCharles Plummer, Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, Professor\r\nLindsay of St. Andrews University, Miss Wordsworth, Principal, and Miss\r\nLodge, Vice-Principal of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford; and in a very special\r\nsense I wish to acknowledge my obligations to Miss Paterson, Assistant\r\nLibrarian at the University Library, St. Andrews, whose unfailing kindness\r\nin verifying references, and supplying me with books, has greatly\r\nlightened my labours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are, it has been estimated, in England and on the Continent, in all\r\nabout 140 manuscripts of the “Ecclesiastical History.” Of these, four date\r\nfrom the eighth century: the Moore MS. (Cambridge), so called, because,\r\nafter being sold by auction in the reign of William III, it came into the\r\npossession of Bishop Moore, who bequeathed it to the University of\r\nCambridge; Cotton, Tiberius A, xiv; Cotton, Tiberius C, ii; and the Namur\r\nMS. A detailed account of these, as well as of a great number of other\r\nmanuscripts, will be found in Mr. Plummer’s Introduction to his edition of\r\nBede’s Historical Works. He has been the first to collate the four oldest\r\nMSS., besides examining numerous others and collating them in certain\r\npassages. He has pointed out that two of the MSS. dating from the eighth\r\ncentury (the century in which Bede died), the Moore MS. and Cotton,\r\nTiberius A, xiv, point to a common original which cannot be far removed\r\nfrom Bede’s autograph. We are thus brought very near to our author, and\r\nmay have more than in most cases the assurance that we have before us what\r\nhe actually meant to say.\r\n\r\nThe earliest editions were printed on the Continent; the “editio princeps”\r\nis believed to date from 1475. A number of editions followed in the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries; the first in England was published by\r\nAbraham Whelock at Cambridge in 1643-4. Smith’s edition in 1722 marked a\r\nnew era in the history of the book. It was the first critical edition, the\r\ntext being based on the Moore MS. collated with three others, of which two\r\nwere eighth century MSS.; and succeeding editors, Stevenson (1841), Giles\r\n(1842), Hussey (1846), the editor in the “Monumenta Historica Britannica”\r\n(1848), Moberly (1869), Holder (1882), base their work mainly on Smith’s.\r\nMr. Mayor and Mr. Lumby together edited Books III and IV with excellent\r\nnotes in 1878. Their text “reproduces exactly the Moore MS.” which they\r\ncollated with some other Cambridge MSS. (cf. Mayor and Lumby, Excursus\r\nII). In 1896 the Rev. C. Plummer published his edition of Bede’s\r\nHistorical Works, the first critical edition since Smith’s, and “the very\r\nfirst which exhibits in an _apparatus criticus_ the various readings of\r\nthe MSS. on which the text is based.” For the student of Bede this\r\nadmirable book is of the highest value, and the labours of all succeeding\r\neditors are made comparatively light. Besides the most minute and accurate\r\nwork on the text, it contains a copious and interesting commentary and the\r\nfullest references to the various sources upon which the editor has drawn.\r\n\r\nThe first translation of the “Ecclesiastical History” is the Anglo-Saxon\r\nversion, executed either by Alfred himself or under his immediate\r\nsupervision. Of this version Dr. Hodgkin says: “As this book had become a\r\nkind of classic among churchmen, Alfred allowed himself here less liberty\r\nthan in some of his other translations. Some letters, epitaphs, and\r\nsimilar documents are omitted, and there is an almost complete erasure of\r\nthe chapters relating to the wearisome Paschal controversy. In other\r\nrespects the king’s translation seems to be a fairly accurate reproduction\r\nof the original work.” Mr. Plummer, however, finds it “very rarely\r\navailable for the settlement of minute differences of reading.”\r\n\r\nThe first modern English translation is Thomas Stapleton’s (1565),\r\npublished at Antwerp. It is a controversial work, intended to point out to\r\nQueen Elizabeth “in how many and weighty pointes the pretended refourmers\r\nof the Church ... have departed from the patern of that sounde and\r\nCatholike faith planted first among Englishmen by holy S. Augustin, our\r\nApostle, and his vertuous company, described truly and sincerely by\r\nVenerable Bede, so called in all Christendom for his passing vertues and\r\nrare lerning, the Author of this History.” To save Elizabeth’s time “in\r\nespying out the particulars,” the translator has “gathered out of the\r\nwhole History a number of diversities between the pretended religion of\r\nProtestants and the primitive faith of the english Church.” If charm and\r\nappropriateness of style were the only qualities to be aimed at in a\r\ntranslation, we might well content ourselves with this rendering, which\r\nfills with despair the translator of to-day, debarred by his date from\r\nwriting Elizabethan English.\r\n\r\nThe work was again translated by John Stevens (1723), and a third time\r\n(with some omissions) by W. Hurst in 1814. In 1840 Dr. Giles published a\r\nnew edition of Stevens’s translation with certain alterations; and a\r\nsecond edition of the same volume was published in 1842, and incorporated\r\nin the collected works of Bede, edited by Dr. Giles. In 1870 a literal\r\ntranslation by the Rev. L. Gidley was published. The present volume is a\r\nrevision of the translation of Dr. Giles.\r\n\r\nA brief analysis of the work may be of some use to the student in keeping\r\ndistinct the different threads of the narrative, as owing to the variety\r\nof subjects introduced, and the want of strict chronological order, it is\r\ndifficult to grasp the sequence of events as a coherent whole.\r\n\r\nThe sources from which Bede draws his material are briefly indicated in\r\nthe dedication to King Ceolwulf which forms the Preface, and in it he\r\nacknowledges his obligations to the friends and correspondents who have\r\nhelped and encouraged him. For the greater part of Book I (cc. 1-22),\r\nwhich forms the introduction to his real subject, he depends on earlier\r\nauthors. Here he does not specify his sources, but indicates them\r\ngenerally as _priorum scripta_. These authors are mainly Pliny, Solinus,\r\nOrosius, Eutropius, and the British historian Gildas. In the story of\r\nGermanus and Lupus he follows closely the Life of Germanus by Constantius\r\nof Lyons. Prosper of Aquitaine also supplies him with some materials. When\r\nhe comes to his main subject, the History of the English Church, he\r\nappears to rely but little upon books. Only a very few are referred to\r\nhere and there, _e.g._, The Life of St. Fursa, The Life of St. Ethelburg,\r\nAdamnan’s work on the Holy Places, and the Anonymous Life of St. Cuthbert.\r\nThat some form of annalistic records existed before his time, and that\r\nthese were consulted by him, we may infer from some of his chronological\r\nreferences (cf. iii, 1, 9). Local information with regard to provinces\r\nother than Northumbria he obtains from his correspondents in various parts\r\nof England, and these are expressly mentioned in the Preface.\r\n\r\nFor the history of the Roman mission and of Kent generally, as well as\r\nsome particulars with regard to the conversion of other provinces, his\r\nchief source is the Church of Canterbury, which apparently possessed,\r\nbesides oral tradition, written documents relating to the first beginnings\r\nof the Church. Moreover, Nothelm, who was the bearer of much important\r\nmaterial, had been to Rome and had permission to search the papal\r\narchives. But it is in dealing with the history of Northumbria, as is\r\nnatural, that Bede’s information is most varied and copious. Much of it is\r\napparently obtained directly from eye-witnesses of the events, much would\r\ndoubtless be preserved in the records of the Church of Lindisfarne, to\r\nwhich he had access, perhaps also in his own monastery. We know that the\r\nmonasteries kept calendars in which the death-days of saints and others\r\nwere entered, and other records of similar nature (cf. iv, 14), and that\r\nthese were used as materials for history.\r\n\r\nPassing to the history itself, we may trace a division of subjects or\r\nperiods roughly analogous to the division into books. Book I contains the\r\nlong introduction, the sending of the Roman mission, and the foundation of\r\nthe Church; Books II and III, the period of missionary activity and the\r\nestablishment of Christianity throughout the land. Book IV may be said to\r\ndescribe the period of organization. In Book V the English Church itself\r\nbecomes a missionary centre, planting the faith in Germany, and drawing\r\nthe Celtic Churches into conformity with Rome.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nBOOK I.—In Book I, cc. 1-22, Bede sketches the early history of Britain,\r\ndescribing the country and giving some account of the various races by\r\nwhom it was inhabited. The story of the Roman occupation is narrated at\r\nsome length, the invasions of the Picts and Scots and consequent miseries\r\nof the Britons, their appeals for help to the Romans, the final departure\r\nof their protectors, and the coming of the Saxons are described. We have\r\nsome shadowy outlines of British Church History in the legendary account\r\nof the conversion of King Lucius, in the story of St. Alban, affording\r\nevidence of a great persecution of Christians during the Roman occupation,\r\nin the allusions to the Arian and Pelagian heresies, and in the mission of\r\nGermanus and Lupus. A brief allusion to the mission of Palladius is all\r\nthat we hear of the Irish Church at this period.\r\n\r\nThese chapters are introductory to the main subject, the History of the\r\nEnglish Church, which begins in Chapter 23 with the mission of St.\r\nAugustine in 597 A.D. The reception of the Christian faith in the kingdom\r\nof Kent and the foundation of a national Church occupy the remaining\r\nchapters of the book. Various letters of Pope Gregory relating to the\r\nmission and his answers to the questions of Augustine are given at length;\r\nand the Book concludes with a piece of Northumbrian history, Ethelfrid’s\r\nconquests of the Britons and the defeat of Aedan, king of the Dalriadic\r\nScots, at Degsastan in 603 A.D.\r\n\r\nBOOK II.—Book II opens with a biographical sketch of Gregory the Great,\r\nthe founder of the Mission. This is followed by an account of Augustine’s\r\nnegotiations with the leaders of the British Church with regard to the\r\nPaschal question and some other matters, his failure to win them over (a\r\nfailure apparently largely due to his own want of tact in dealing with the\r\nsusceptible Celtic temperament), his alleged prophecy of disaster and its\r\nfulfilment some time after at the battle of Chester. Then we have the\r\nconsecration of Mellitus to London, as Bishop of the East Saxons, and\r\nJustus to Rochester (604 A.D.); the evangelization of the East Saxons by\r\nMellitus; the death of Augustine and succession of Laurentius as\r\nArchbishop (no date is given; it may have been in 605); fresh attempts at\r\nunion with the Celtic Churches, in which again we can perceive a failure\r\nof courtesy on the one side met by an obstinate pride on the other. The\r\ndeath of Ethelbert in Kent (616 A.D.) and that of Sabert in Essex, soon\r\nafter, lead to a pagan reaction in both provinces; Mellitus and Justus\r\ntake refuge on the Continent; Laurentius, intending to follow them, is\r\nstopped by a vision which leads to the conversion of King Eadbald and the\r\nrecovery of Kent for Christianity. Essex, however, continues to be pagan.\r\nOn the death of Laurentius (619 A.D.), Mellitus succeeds to Canterbury and\r\nis himself succeeded by Justus (in 624). In Chapter 9 we enter upon a new\r\ndevelopment of the highest importance in the work of the mission. The\r\nmarriage of Edwin, king of Northumbria, and the Kentish princess,\r\nEthelberg, brings about the conversion of Northumbria through the\r\npreaching of Paulinus. The story is told in detail. Letters from Pope\r\nBoniface to Edwin and his consort are quoted at length, Edwin’s early\r\nhistory with its bearing on the great crisis of his life is related;\r\nfinally we have the decisive debate in the Witenagemot at Goodmanham and\r\nthe baptism of the king at Easter, 627 A.D. Through the influence of Edwin\r\non Earpwald, king of East Anglia, that province is next converted, but on\r\nthe death of Earpwald the people lapse into paganism for three years, till\r\nChristianity is finally established by the labours of Bishop Felix, under\r\nthe enlightened King Sigbert, who had himself been drawn to the faith in\r\nGaul.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, peace and prosperity reign in Northumbria, and Paulinus extends\r\nhis preaching to Lindsey. He re-receives the pall from Pope Honorius, in\r\naccordance with the original intention of Gregory that the Bishop of York\r\nshould rank as a metropolitan. At Canterbury, Justus is succeeded by\r\nArchbishop Honorius. Parenthetically we have extracts from letters,\r\nprobably of the year 640 A.D., addressed by the Roman see to the Irish\r\nclergy on the Paschal question and the Pelagian heresy.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 20 we have a dramatic climax to the book in the overthrow and\r\ndeath of Edwin at the battle of Hatfield in 633 A.D.; the devastation of\r\nNorthumbria by the British king, Caedwalla, and Penda of Mercia; and the\r\nflight of Paulinus, taking with him Ethelberg and Eanfled to Kent, where\r\nhe ends his life in charge of the Church of Rochester. His work in\r\nNorthumbria seems for the time, at least, wholly overthrown. Only James\r\nthe Deacon remains heroically at his post to keep alive the smouldering\r\nembers of the faith.\r\n\r\nBOOK III.—Book III opens with the story of the apostasy of the\r\nNorthumbrian kings and the miseries of the “Hateful Year,” terminated by\r\nthe victory of Oswald at Heavenfield in 634 A.D. Christianity is brought\r\nagain to Northumbria (635 A.D.) by the Celtic Mission, sent from Iona at\r\nthe request of Oswald, who nobly co-operates with Aidan in the work of\r\nevangelization. Aidan fixes his see at Lindisfarne. The mention of Iona\r\nleads to a short account of the mission of St. Columba to the Northern\r\nPicts in 565 A.D., and incidentally of St. Ninian’s mission to the\r\nSouthern Picts “long before”; the grant of Iona to St. Columba, and its\r\nconstitution, the character of its monks and their error with regard to\r\nEaster. The characters of Aidan and Oswald are described; and the union of\r\nDeira and Bernicia under Oswald is briefly mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 7 we pass to a fresh missionary enterprise. Birinus, sent to\r\nBritain by Pope Honorius, converts the West Saxons. Their king, Cynegils,\r\nis baptized, and a see is established at Dorchester, in Oxfordshire. Under\r\nCoinwalch, the successor of Cynegils, the province passes through various\r\nvicissitudes, political and ecclesiastical, and finally the West Saxon see\r\nis fixed at Winchester.\r\n\r\nIn Kent, Earconbert succeeds Eadbald in 640 A.D., and takes vigorous\r\nmeasures for the suppression of idolatry. His daughter, Earcongota, and\r\nmany other high-born English ladies enter the religious life in Gaul, for\r\nconvents are still scarce in England.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 9, reverting to the history of Northumbria, Bede tells us of\r\nthe death of Oswald at Maserfelth in 642, and relates at length various\r\nmiracles wrought by his relics. Oswald is succeeded by Oswy in Bernicia\r\nand in Deira by Oswin. The latter is treacherously murdered by Oswy; his\r\ncharacter is described. The death of Aidan (in 651) immediately follows\r\nthat of his beloved king; Aidan’s miracles are related, and a warm tribute\r\nis paid to his character, in spite of the inevitable error with regard to\r\nEaster, which is severely condemned.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 18, passing again to East Anglian history, we hear of King\r\nSigbert’s services to education, and of his retirement to a monastery from\r\nwhich he was forcibly drawn to fall in battle against the Mercians. (The\r\nchronology is here very vague.) A vision of the Irish St. Fursa, who\r\nfounded the monastery of Cnobheresburg in East Anglia is told in detail.\r\nChanges in the episcopate in East Anglia and elsewhere are mentioned.\r\nDeusdedit succeeds Honorius as Archbishop of Canterbury in 654.\r\n\r\nAgain, a Northumbrian prince gives a fresh impulse to the spread of\r\nChristianity. In 653 the Middle Angles (who occupied a part of Mercia) are\r\nconverted, their prince, Peada, being persuaded chiefly by his\r\nbrother-in-law, Alchfrid, a son of Oswy. Four priests are sent to them to\r\npreach and baptize, Cedd, Adda, Betti, and Diuma, and Diuma becomes bishop\r\nof the Middle Angles and Mercians. Similarly, at this time, King Sigbert\r\nof Essex listens to the exhortations of his friend, King Oswy, and, at the\r\npreaching of Cedd, the East Saxons receive the faith a second time. Cedd\r\nbecomes their bishop. Sigbert’s tragic death is related. His successor,\r\nSuidhelm, receives baptism at the hands of Cedd. The foundation of\r\nLastingham by Ethelwald of Deira and its consecration by Cedd are\r\ndescribed. Cedd dies of the plague of 664.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, important political changes have taken place in the north: the\r\ndefeat and death of Penda at the Winwaed in 655 are followed by Oswy’s\r\nrule, which established Christianity in Mercia, in spite of a successful\r\nrebellion after three years, when the Mercians threw off the yoke of\r\nNorthumbria and set up Penda’s son, Wulfhere, as their king.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 25 we come to the Synod of Whitby (664 A.D.), which settled the\r\nEaster question for the English Church. Wilfrid comes to the front as a\r\nchampion of the Catholic rules. The opposing party either retire or\r\nconform. The self-denial and devotion of the Celtic missionaries are\r\nhighly praised, and some account of the life led by English students in\r\nIreland follows, with the story of the self-dedication of Egbert, who is\r\ndestined to play a prominent part afterwards in the history of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe consecration of both Wilfrid and Ceadda (664 A.D.), as bishops of\r\nNorthumbria leads to complications in the episcopate. An important step\r\ntowards the unity of the English nation in ecclesiastical matters is taken\r\nwhen Wighard is sent to Rome by the kings Oswy and Egbert, acting in\r\nconcert, to be consecrated as Archbishop of Canterbury (667 A.D.). Wighard\r\ndies there, and Pope Vitalian undertakes to find an archbishop for the\r\nEnglish Church.\r\n\r\nThe book ends with a fresh apostasy in Essex during the miseries of the\r\ngreat plague of 664. Mercia, so lately itself evangelized, becomes a new\r\nmissionary centre, King Wulfhere sending Bishop Jaruman to recall the East\r\nSaxons to the faith.\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.—In all but one of the kingdoms of England Christianity is now, at\r\nleast in name, established, and the Church settles down to the work of\r\norganization. The man for this task is found in Theodore of Tarsus,\r\nconsecrated Archbishop of the English in 668. He arrives at Canterbury in\r\n669. We hear at once of the vigorous impulse given by him and Abbot\r\nHadrian to the various departments of education there. Finding an\r\nirregularity in Ceadda’s orders, he completes his ordination and makes him\r\nBishop of the Mercians (probably in 669), with his see at Lichfield.\r\nCeadda’s death (672 A.D.), his character, and the miracles and visions\r\nconnected with him are described. Parenthetically we get an account of\r\nColman’s activity in Ireland after his retirement, in consequence of the\r\ndecision at Whitby. The most important political events at this time are\r\nthe death of Oswy and succession of Egfrid in Northumbria in 670 or 671,\r\nand the death of Egbert and succession of Hlothere in Kent in 673.\r\n\r\nIn the same year the Council of Hertford, the first English provincial\r\ncouncil, is held, and marks the strength and independence of the Church.\r\nTheodore proceeds with his reforms in the episcopate. Various events of\r\necclesiastical importance follow; the East Anglian diocese is divided\r\nabout this time, and other changes are effected.\r\n\r\nEssex, so long prone to lapses into paganism, becomes at this time a\r\ncentre of religious life under its Bishop Earconwald and its king Sebbi.\r\nEarconwald, whose holiness is attested by many miraculous circumstances,\r\nwas the founder of the monasteries of Chertsey and Barking, the latter of\r\nwhich was ruled by his sister, the saintly Ethelburg. Various miracles are\r\nrelated in connection with her and her monastery. The king of the East\r\nSaxons, Sebbi, is a man of unusual piety who resigns his kingdom and\r\nreceives the tonsure.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief allusion to West Saxon history, the devastation of Kent by\r\nEthelred of Mercia in 676, and certain changes in the episcopate, we come\r\nto an important step in the organization of the Church taken by Theodore.\r\nIn pursuance of his policy of increasing the number of bishops, he\r\nsubdivides the great Northumbrian diocese. Wilfrid is expelled (678 A.D.).\r\nFrom these events we pass summarily to the evangelization of the South\r\nSaxons by Wilfrid, who extends his labours to the Isle of Wight, and thus\r\nthe last of the English provinces is won for the faith.\r\n\r\nIn the Council of Hatfield (680 A.D.) the English Church asserts its\r\northodoxy and unites with the continental Churches in repudiating the\r\nheresy of the Monothelites. Turning to Northumbrian history, we have the\r\nstory of Egfrid’s queen, Ethelthryth, and a hymn composed in her honour by\r\nBede. The war between Mercia and Northumbria in 679 is ended by the\r\nmediation of Theodore, and a miracle in connection with the battle of the\r\nTrent is related.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the book is occupied mainly with Northumbrian history,\r\nthe life and death of Hilda, Abbess of Whitby, the story of the poet\r\nCaedmon, the destruction of Coldingham, prophesied by the monk Adamnan,\r\nEgfrid’s invasion of Ireland (684 A.D.) and of the country of the Picts\r\n(685 A.D.), his defeat and death in that year, the decline of Northumbria,\r\nthe flight of Bishop Trumwine from Abercorn, and the succession of Aldfrid\r\nto the kingdom. The death of Hlothere of Kent (685 A.D.) is followed by\r\nanarchy in that province, till Wictred succeeds and restores peace.\r\n\r\nIn Chapters 27-32 we have an account of the life of St. Cuthbert and\r\nstories of the miracles wrought by his relics.\r\n\r\nBOOK V.—Book V opens with the story of the holy Ethelwald, who succeeded\r\nCuthbert as anchorite at Farne, and a miracle wrought through his\r\nintercession. This is followed (cc. 2-6) by an account of John of\r\nBeverley, Bishop of Hexham, and the miracles attributed to him. In Chapter\r\n7 we have a piece of West Saxon history: Caedwalla, King of Wessex, after\r\na life of war and bloodshed, goes to Rome to receive baptism there, and\r\ndies immediately after his admission into the Church (689 A.D.). He is\r\nsucceeded by Ini, who in 725 likewise ended his days at Rome.\r\n\r\nIn 690 Theodore dies, after an episcopate of twenty-two years. Bertwald\r\nsucceeds him at Canterbury in 693.\r\n\r\nAt this time Englishmen begin to extend their missionary enterprise\r\nabroad. Various missions are undertaken by men who have lived long in\r\nIreland and caught the Celtic zeal for the work of evangelization. The\r\nstory is told of the attempted mission of Egbert to Germany and the\r\nunsuccessful venture of Witbert. Wilbrord (in 690) and others plant the\r\nfaith among the German tribes.\r\n\r\nThe vision of Drythelm is inserted here, probably on chronological grounds\r\n(“his temporibus”), and other visions of the future world follow.\r\n\r\nApparently about the same time a change is effected in the attitude of the\r\ngreater part of the Celtic Church towards the Paschal question. The\r\nNorthern Irish are converted to the Roman usages by Adamnan, Abbot of\r\nIona, whose book on the “Holy Places” is here described (cc. 16-17).\r\n\r\nThe death of Aldfrid and succession of Osred in Northumbria in 705 are the\r\nnext events narrated.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the division of the West Saxon diocese is carried out,\r\nAldhelm being appointed to Sherborne and Daniel to Winchester; the South\r\nSaxons receive a bishop of their own for the first time. In 709 A.D.\r\nCoenred of Mercia and Offa of Essex receive the tonsure at Rome, and in\r\nthe same year Bishop Wilfrid dies. The story of his life is told.\r\n\r\nNot long after, Hadrian dies and is succeeded by Albinus as Abbot of St.\r\nAugustine’s. Bede’s friend, Acca, succeeds Wilfrid as Bishop of Hexham.\r\nHis services to the Church are enumerated.\r\n\r\nAn important step is taken at this time by the Northern Picts in the\r\nacceptance of the Roman rules with regard to Easter and the tonsure. The\r\nletter of Abbot Ceolfrid of Wearmouth and Jarrow to the Pictish king\r\nNaiton on this subject is quoted at length. Soon after, Iona yields to the\r\npreaching of Egbert, and receives the Catholic usages. Egbert dies in 729.\r\nIn Chapter 23 a number of events are briefly mentioned; the death of\r\nWictred of Kent in 725, and the succession of his sons, the death of the\r\nlearned Tobias, Bishop of Rochester, in 726, the appearance of two comets\r\nin 729, followed by the devastation of Gaul by the Saracens, the death of\r\nthe Northumbrian king Osric, and succession of Ceolwulf in 729; finally,\r\nthe death of Archbishop Bertwald in 731 and the succession of Tatwine.\r\nThen follows an account of the state of the English episcopate in 731, the\r\nyear in which Bede finished the History. The relations of the English with\r\nPicts, Scots, and Britons are described, and some allusion is made to the\r\ngrowth of monasticism in this time of external peace.\r\n\r\nThe book closes in Chapter 24 with a chronological summary of the whole\r\nwork, an autobiographical sketch of the author, and a list of his works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF BEDE\r\n\r\n\r\nFew lives afford less material for the biographer than Bede’s; few seem to\r\npossess a more irresistible fascination. Often as the simple story has\r\nbeen told, the desire to tell it afresh appears to be perennial. And yet\r\nit is perhaps as wholly devoid of incident as any life could be. The short\r\nautobiographical sketch at the end of the “Ecclesiastical History” tells\r\nus practically all: that he was born in the territory of the twin\r\nmonastery of Wearmouth and Jarrow; that at the age of seven he was sent by\r\nhis kinsfolk to be brought up, first under the Abbot Benedict, afterwards\r\nunder Ceolfrid; that in his nineteenth year (the canonical age was\r\ntwenty-five) he was admitted to the diaconate, and received priest’s\r\norders in his thirtieth year, in both instances at the hands of John,\r\nBishop of Hexham, and by order of the Abbot Ceolfrid; that he spent his\r\nwhole life in the monastery in learning, in teaching, and in writing, and\r\nin the observance of the monastic rule and attendance at the daily\r\nservices of the Church. Of his family we know nothing; the name Beda\r\nappears to have been not uncommon. The fact that he was handed over by\r\nkinsmen (“cura propinquorum”) to Abbot Benedict would seem to imply that\r\nhe was an orphan when he entered the monastery at the age of seven, but it\r\nwas not unusual for parents to dedicate their infant children to the\r\nreligious life, in many cases even at an earlier age than Bede’s. We may\r\ncompare the story of the little boy, Aesica, at Barking, related by Bede,\r\nand of Elfled, the daughter of Oswy, dedicated by her father before she\r\nwas a year old.\r\n\r\nThe epithet “Venerable,” commonly attached to his name, has given rise to\r\nmore than one legend. It was apparently first applied to him in the ninth\r\ncentury, and is said to have been an appellation of priests. The best\r\nknown of these legends is Fuller’s story of a certain “dunce monk” who set\r\nabout writing Bede’s epitaph, and being unable to complete the verse, “Hic\r\nsunt in fossa Bedae ... ossa,” went to bed with his task unfinished.\r\nReturning to it in the morning, he found that an angel had filled the gap\r\nwith the word “venerabilis.” Another account tells how Bede, in his old\r\nage, when his eyes were dim, was induced by certain “mockers” to preach,\r\nunder the mistaken belief that the people were assembled to hear him. As\r\nhe ended his sermon with a solemn invocation of the Trinity, the angels\r\n(in one version it is the stones of a rocky valley) responded “Amen, very\r\nvenerable Bede.”\r\n\r\nThe land on which Bede was born was granted by Egfrid to Benedict Biscop\r\nfor the foundation of the monasteries a short time after the birth of\r\nBede. Wearmouth was founded in 674, Jarrow in 681 or 682. Bede was among\r\nthose members of the community who were transferred to Jarrow under Abbot\r\nCeolfrid, and under his rule and that of his successor, Huaetbert, he\r\npassed his life. With regard to the chief dates, the authorities differ,\r\nSimeon of Durham and others placing his birth as late as 677. Bede himself\r\ntells us that he was in his fifty-ninth year when he wrote the short\r\nautobiography at the end of the History. That work was finished in 731,\r\nand there seems to be no good reason to suppose that the autobiographical\r\nsketch was written at a later time. We may infer then that he was born in\r\n673, that he was ordained deacon in 691 and priest in 702. For his death,\r\n735, the date given in the “Continuation,” seems to be supported by the\r\nevidence of the letter of Cuthbert to Cuthwin (_v. infra_). From this it\r\nappears that he died on a Wednesday, which nevertheless is called\r\nAscension Day, implying, doubtless, that his death occurred on the eve,\r\nafter the festival had begun, according to ecclesiastical reckoning. It is\r\nfurther explained that Ascension Day was on the 26th of May (“VII Kal.\r\nJunii”),(1) which was actually the case in the year 735.\r\n\r\nBeyond the testimony borne to his exceptional diligence as a student in a\r\nletter from Alcuin to the monks of Wearmouth and Jarrow, we hear nothing\r\nof his childhood and early youth. One anecdote in the Anonymous History of\r\nthe Abbots may perhaps refer to him, though no name is given. It tells\r\nhow, when the plague of 686 devastated the monastery, the Abbot Ceolfrid,\r\nfor lack of fit persons to assist at the daily offices, decided to recite\r\nthe psalms without antiphons, except at vespers and matins. But after a\r\nweek’s trial, unable to bear it any longer, he restored the antiphons to\r\ntheir proper place, and with the help of one little boy carried on the\r\nservices in the usual manner. This little boy is described as being, at\r\nthe time the History was written, a priest of that monastery who “duly,\r\nboth by his words and writings, commends the Abbot’s praiseworthy deeds to\r\nall who seek to know them,” and he has generally been supposed to be Bede.\r\n\r\nIn the “Ecclesiastical History” (IV, 3) there is an allusion to Bede’s\r\nteachers, one of whom, Trumbert, educated at Lastingham under Ceadda, is\r\nmentioned by name. The monastery of Wearmouth and Jarrow must have offered\r\nexceptional facilities for study. Benedict had enriched it with many\r\ntreasures which he brought with him from his travels. Chief among these\r\nwas the famous library which he founded and which was enlarged by Abbot\r\nCeolfrid. Here Bede acquired that wide and varied learning revealed in his\r\nhistorical, scientific, and theological works. He studied with particular\r\ncare and reverence the patristic writings; his theological treatises were,\r\nas he says, “compiled out of the works of the venerable Fathers.” He must\r\nhave had a considerable knowledge of Greek, probably he knew some Hebrew.\r\nThough he is not wholly free from the mediaeval churchman’s distrust of\r\npagan authors, he constantly betrays his acquaintance with them, and the\r\nsense of form which must unconsciously influence the student of classical\r\nliterature has passed into his own writings and preserved him from the\r\nbarbarism of monkish Latin. His style is singularly clear, simple, and\r\nfluent, as free from obscurity as from affectation and bombast.\r\n\r\nThus was the foundation laid of that sound learning upon which his\r\nwidespread influence both as a teacher and writer was reared. “I always\r\ntook delight,” he tells us, “in learning, or teaching, or writing.”\r\nProbably his writing was, as is so often the case, the outcome of his\r\nteaching; his object in both is to meet “the needs of the brethren.” One\r\nof his pupils was Archbishop Egbert, the founder of the school of York,\r\nwhich gave a fresh impulse to learning, not only in England, but through\r\nAlcuin in France, at a time when a revival was most to be desired.\r\n\r\nIt was to Egbert that he paid one of the only two visits which he records.\r\nIn the “Epistola ad Ecgbertum” he alludes to a short stay he had made with\r\nhim the year before, and declines, on account of the illness which proved\r\nto be his last, an invitation to visit him again. He visited Lindisfarne\r\nin connection with his task of writing the life of Cuthbert. Otherwise we\r\nhave no authentic record of any absence from the monastery. The story that\r\nhe went to Rome at the request of Pope Sergius, founded on a statement of\r\nWilliam of Malmesbury, is now regarded as highly improbable. The oldest\r\nMS. of the letter of Sergius, requesting Ceolfrid to send one of his monks\r\nto Rome, has no mention of the name of Bede. If such an event had ever\r\ndisturbed his accustomed course of life, it is inconceivable that he\r\nshould nowhere allude to it. Still less is the assertion that he lived and\r\ntaught at Cambridge one which need be seriously debated by the present\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nWe may fairly assume that, except for a few short absences such as the\r\nvisits to York and Lindisfarne, his whole life was spent in the monastery.\r\nIt must have been a life of unremitting toil. His writings, numerous as\r\nthey are, covering a wide range of subjects and involving the severest\r\nstudy, can only have been a part of his work; he had, besides, his duties\r\nas priest, teacher, and member of a religious community to fulfil. Even\r\nthe manual labour of his literary work must have been considerable. He did\r\nnot employ an amanuensis, and he had not the advantages with regard to\r\ncopyists which a member of one of the larger monasteries might have had.\r\n“Ipse mihi dictator simul notarius (= shorthand writer) et librarius (=\r\ncopyist),” he writes. Yet he never flags. Through all the outward monotony\r\nof his days his own interest remains fresh. He “takes delight” (“dulce\r\nhabui”) in it all. It is a life full of eager activity in intellectual\r\nthings, of a keen and patriotic interest in the wider life beyond the\r\nmonastery walls, which shows itself sadly enough in his reflections on the\r\nevils of the times, of the ardent charity which spends itself in labour\r\nfor the brethren, and, pervading the whole, that spirit of quiet obedience\r\nand devotion which his own simple words describe as “the observance of\r\nmonastic rule and the daily charge of singing in the Church.” We can\r\npicture him, at the appointed hours, breaking off his absorbing\r\noccupations to take his place at the daily offices, lest, as he believed,\r\nhe should fail to meet the angels there. Alcuin records a saying of his,\r\n“I know that angels visit the canonical hours and the congregations of the\r\nbrethren. What if they do not find me among the brethren? May they not\r\nsay, ‘Where is Bede?’ ”\r\n\r\nIt is probably here, in this harmony of work and devotion, that we may\r\nfind the secret of the fascination in the record of his uneventful days.\r\nIt reconciles the sharp antithesis between the active and the\r\ncontemplative life. It seems to attain to that ideal of “toil unsever’d\r\nfrom tranquillity” which haunts us all, but which we have almost ceased to\r\nassociate with the life of man under present conditions. Balance,\r\nmoderation, or rather, that rare quality which has been well called “the\r\nsanity of saintliness,”(2) these give a unity to the life of Bede and\r\npreserve him from the exaggerations of the conventual ideal. With all his\r\nadmiration for the ascetic life, he recognizes human limitations. It is\r\ncheering to find that even he felt the need of a holiday. “Having\r\ncompleted,” he writes, “the third book of the Commentary on Samuel, I\r\nthought I would rest awhile, and, after recovering in that way my delight\r\nin study and writing, proceed to take in hand the fourth.” Intellectual\r\npower commands his homage, but his mind is open to the appreciation of all\r\nforms of excellence. It is the unlearned brother, unfit for study and\r\noccupied in manual labour, to whom, in his story, it is vouchsafed to hear\r\nthe singing of the angels who came to summon Ceadda to his rest. The life\r\nof devotion ranks highest in his estimation, but he records with approval\r\nhow St. Cuthbert thought “that to afford the weak brethren the help of his\r\nexhortation stood in the stead of prayer, knowing that He Who said ‘Thou\r\nshalt love the Lord thy God,’ said likewise, ‘Thou shalt love thy\r\nneighbour as thyself.’ ” He tells us how St. Gregory bewailed his own loss\r\nin being forced by his office to be entangled in worldly affairs. “But,”\r\nadds the human-hearted biographer, “it behoves us to believe that he lost\r\nnothing of his monastic perfection by reason of his pastoral charge, but\r\nrather that he gained greater profit through the labour of converting\r\nmany, than by the former calm of his private life.” Yet he holds that this\r\nimmunity from the evil influence of the world was chiefly due to Gregory’s\r\ncare in organizing his house like a monastery and safeguarding the\r\nopportunities for prayer and devotional study, even while he was immersed\r\nin affairs at the court of Constantinople, and afterwards, when he held\r\nthe most onerous office in the Church.\r\n\r\nThis quality of sanity shows itself again in an unusual degree of fairness\r\nto opponents. The Paschal error, indeed, moves his indignation in a manner\r\nwhich is incomprehensible and distasteful to the modern reader, but even\r\nin the perverse and erring Celts he can recognize “a zeal of God, though\r\nnot according to knowledge.” Aidan’s holiness of life wins from him a warm\r\ntribute of admiration. In the monks of Iona, the stronghold of the Celtic\r\nsystem, he can perceive the fruit of good works and find an excuse for\r\ntheir error in their isolated situation. In the British Church it is the\r\nlack of missionary zeal, rather than their attitude towards the Easter\r\nquestion, which calls forth his strongest condemnation.\r\n\r\nA characteristic akin to this is his love of truth. As a historian, it\r\nshows itself in his scrupulous care in investigating evidence and in\r\nacknowledging the sources from which he draws. Nowhere is his intellectual\r\nhonesty more apparent than in dealing with what he believes to be the\r\nmiraculous element in his history. In whatever way we may regard these\r\nanecdotes, there can be no doubt that Bede took the utmost pains to assure\r\nhimself of their authenticity. He is careful to acquire, if possible,\r\nfirst-hand evidence; where this cannot be obtained, he scrupulously\r\nmentions the lack of it. He admits only the testimony of witnesses of high\r\ncharacter and generally quotes them by name.\r\n\r\nThese are but a few of the glimpses afforded us of the personality of\r\nBede, a personality never obtruded, but everywhere unconsciously revealed\r\nin his work. Everywhere we find the impress of a mind of wide intellectual\r\ngrasp, a character of the highest saintliness, and a gentle refinement of\r\nthought and feeling. The lofty spirituality of Bede, his great learning\r\nand scholarly attainment are the more striking when we reflect how\r\nrecently his nation had emerged from barbarism and received Christianity\r\nand the culture which it brought with it to these shores.\r\n\r\nThe letter in which he declines Egbert’s invitation on the plea of illness\r\nis dated November, 734. If we may assume that his death took place on the\r\neve of Ascension Day in 735, no long period of enfeebled health clouded\r\nthe close of his life, and weakness never interrupted his work. His death\r\nhas been described by his pupil, Cuthbert, who afterwards became Abbot of\r\nWearmouth and Jarrow in succession to Huaetbert, in the letter quoted\r\nbelow. He was first buried at Jarrow but, according to Simeon of Durham,\r\nhis relics were stolen by the priest, Elfred, and carried to Durham. In\r\n1104, when the bones of Cuthbert were translated to the new Cathedral,\r\nthose of Bede were found with them. Not long after, Hugh de Puisac erected\r\na shrine of gold and silver, adorned with jewels, in which he placed them,\r\nalong with the relics of many other saints. The shrine disappeared at the\r\nReformation, and only the stone on which it rested remains.(3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter of Cuthbert to Cuthwin.\r\n\r\n\r\n“To his fellow-lector, Cuthwin, beloved in Christ, Cuthbert, his\r\nfellow-student, greeting and salvation for ever in the Lord. I have very\r\ngladly received the gift which thou sentest to me, and with much joy have\r\nread thy devout and learned letter, wherein I found that which I greatly\r\ndesired, to wit, that masses and holy prayers are diligently offered by\r\nyou for our father and master Bede, beloved of God. Wherefore I rejoice,\r\nrather for love of him than from confidence in my own power, to relate in\r\nfew words after what manner he departed out of this world, understanding\r\nalso that thou hast desired and asked this of me. He was troubled with\r\nweakness and chiefly with difficulty in breathing, yet almost without\r\npain, for about a fortnight before the day of our Lord’s Resurrection; and\r\nthus he afterwards passed his time, cheerful and rejoicing, giving thanks\r\nto Almighty God every day and night, nay, every hour, till the day of our\r\nLord’s Ascension, to wit, the twenty-sixth day of May, and daily gave\r\nlessons to us, his disciples; and whatsoever remained of the day he spent\r\nin singing psalms, as far as he was able; he also strove to pass all the\r\nnight joyfully in prayer and thanksgiving to God, save only when a short\r\nsleep prevented it; and then he no sooner awoke than he straightway began\r\nagain to repeat the well-known sacred songs, and ceased not to give thanks\r\nto God with uplifted hands. I declare with truth that I have never seen\r\nwith my eyes, or heard with my ears, any man so earnest in giving thanks\r\nto the living God. O truly blessed man! He repeated the words of St. Paul\r\nthe Apostle, ‘It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living\r\nGod,’ and much more out of Holy Scripture; wherein also he admonished us\r\nto think of our last hour, and to arise out of the sleep of the soul; and\r\nbeing learned in our native poetry, he said also in our tongue, concerning\r\nthe dread parting of souls from the body:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Fore then neidfaerae\r\n    naenig uiuurthit\r\n    thonc suotturra\r\n    than him tharf sie\r\n    to ymb hycggannae\r\n    aer his hin iongae\r\n    huaet his gastae\r\n    godaes aeththa yflaes\r\n    aefter deothdaege\r\n    doemid uueorthae.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich being interpreted is: “Before the inevitable journey hence, no man\r\nis wiser than is needful that he may consider, ere the soul departs, what\r\ngood or evil it hath done and how it shall be judged after its departure.”\r\n\r\n“He also sang antiphons for our comfort and his own. One of these is, ‘O\r\nKing of Glory, Lord of all power, Who, triumphing this day, didst ascend\r\nabove all the heavens, leave us not comfortless, but send to us the\r\npromise of the Father, even the Spirit of Truth—Hallelujah.’ And when he\r\ncame to the words, ‘leave us not comfortless,’ he burst into tears and\r\nwept much. And an hour after, he fell to repeating what he had begun. And\r\nthis he did the whole day, and we, hearing it, mourned with him and wept.\r\nNow we read and now we lamented, nay, we wept even as we read. In such\r\nrapture we passed the fifty days’ festival(4) till the aforesaid day; and\r\nhe rejoiced greatly and gave God thanks, because he had been accounted\r\nworthy to suffer such weakness. And he often said, ‘God scourgeth every\r\nson whom He receiveth’; and the words of St. Ambrose, ‘I have not so lived\r\nas to be ashamed to live among you; but neither do I fear to die, because\r\nwe have a merciful Lord.’ And during those days, besides the lessons we\r\nhad daily from him, and the singing of the Psalms, there were two\r\nmemorable works, which he strove to finish; to wit, his translation of the\r\nGospel of St. John, from the beginning, as far as the words, ‘But what are\r\nthey among so many?’ into our own tongue, for the benefit of the Church of\r\nGod; and some selections from the books of Bishop Isidore, saying, ‘I\r\nwould not have my boys read a lie, nor labour herein without profit after\r\nmy death.’\r\n\r\n“When the Tuesday before the Ascension of our Lord came, he began to\r\nsuffer still more in his breathing, and there was some swelling in his\r\nfeet. But he went on teaching all that day and dictating cheerfully, and\r\nnow and then said among other things, ‘Learn quickly, I know not how long\r\nI shall endure, and whether my Maker will not soon take me away.’ But to\r\nus it seemed that haply he knew well the time of his departure; and so he\r\nspent the night, awake, in giving of thanks. And when the morning dawned,\r\nthat is, on the Wednesday, he bade us write with all speed what we had\r\nbegun. And this we did until the third hour. And from the third hour we\r\nwalked in procession with the relics of the saints, according to the\r\ncustom of that day.(5) And there was one of us with him who said to him,\r\n‘There is still one chapter wanting of the book which thou hast been\r\ndictating, but I deem it burdensome for thee to be questioned any\r\nfurther.’ He answered, ‘Nay, it is light, take thy pen and make ready, and\r\nwrite quickly.’ And this was done. But at the ninth hour he said to me, ‘I\r\nhave certain treasures in my coffer, some spices, napkins and incense; run\r\nquickly and bring the priests of our monastery to me, that I may\r\ndistribute among them the gifts which God has bestowed on me.’ And this I\r\ndid trembling, and when they were come, he spoke to every one of them,\r\nadmonishing and entreating them that they should diligently offer masses\r\nand prayers for him, and they promised readily. But they all mourned and\r\nwept, sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, because they\r\nthought that they should see his face no long time in this world. But they\r\nrejoiced for that he said, ‘It is time for me, if it be my Maker’s will,\r\nto be set free from the flesh, and come to Him Who, when as yet I was not,\r\nformed me out of nothing. I have lived long; and well has my pitiful judge\r\ndisposed my life for me; the time of my release is at hand; for my soul\r\nlongs to see Christ my King in His beauty.’ Having said this and much more\r\nfor our profit and edification, he passed his last day in gladness till\r\nthe evening; and the aforesaid boy, whose name was Wilbert, still said,\r\n‘Dear master, there is yet one sentence not written.’ He answered, ‘It is\r\nwell, write it.’ Soon after, the boy said, ‘Now it is written.’ And he\r\nsaid, ‘It is well, thou hast said truly, it is finished. Take my head in\r\nthy hands, for I rejoice greatly to sit facing my holy place where I was\r\nwont to pray, that I too, sitting there, may call upon my Father.’ And\r\nthus on the pavement of his little cell, chanting ‘Glory be to the Father,\r\nand to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost,’ and the rest, he breathed his\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n“And without doubt we must believe that inasmuch as he had always been\r\ndevout and earnest on earth in the praise of God, his soul was carried by\r\nangels to the joys of Heaven which he desired. And all who heard him or\r\nbeheld the death of our father Bede, said that they had never seen any\r\nother end his life in so great devotion and peace. For, as thou hast\r\nheard, so long as the soul abode in the body, he chanted the ‘Gloria\r\nPatri’ and other words to the glory of God, and with outstretched hands\r\nceased not to give thanks to God.\r\n\r\n“But know this, that much could be told and written concerning him, but my\r\nwant of learning cuts short my words. Nevertheless, with the help of God,\r\nI purpose at leisure to write more fully concerning him, of those things\r\nwhich I saw with my own eyes and heard with my own ears.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERRATA\r\n\r\n\r\nPage 9, headline, _for_ “54 A.D.” _read_ “54 B.C.”\r\n\r\nPage 21, headline, _for_ “394 A.D.” _read_ “395 A.D.”\r\n\r\nPage 214, note 4, _for_ “cc.” _read_ “pp.” [Transcriber’s Note: This is\r\nthe footnote to Bright.]\r\n\r\nPage 215, note 1, _for_ “St. James ‘the Less’ ” _read_ “James, ‘the Lord’s\r\nbrother.’ ” [Transcriber’s Note: This is the footnote to “the Eastern.”]\r\n\r\nPage 220, note 2, _for_ “Lumley” _read_ “Lumby.” [Transcriber’s Note: This\r\nis the footnote starting “A stone.”]\r\n\r\nPage 254, note 1, line 4, _for_ “existence” _read_ “co-existence.”\r\n[Transcriber’s Note: This is the footnote starting “Eutyches was\r\nArchimandrite.”]\r\n\r\nPage 316, line 7, _for_ “Gedmund” _read_ “Gebmund.”\r\n\r\nPage 346, note 6, _for_ “p. 56” _read_ “p. 356.” [Transcriber’s Note: This\r\nis the footnote starting “Ripon, _v. infra_”]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the most glorious king Ceolwulf._(_6_)_ Bede, the servant of Christ\r\nand Priest._\r\n\r\nI formerly, at your request, most readily sent to you the Ecclesiastical\r\nHistory of the English Nation, which I had lately published, for you to\r\nread and judge; and I now send it again to be transcribed, and more fully\r\nstudied at your leisure. And I rejoice greatly at the sincerity and zeal,\r\nwith which you not only diligently give ear to hear the words of Holy\r\nScripture, but also industriously take care to become acquainted with the\r\nactions and sayings of former men of renown, especially of our own nation.\r\nFor if history relates good things of good men, the attentive hearer is\r\nexcited to imitate that which is good; or if it recounts evil things of\r\nwicked persons, none the less the conscientious and devout hearer or\r\nreader, shunning that which is hurtful and wrong, is the more earnestly\r\nfired to perform those things which he knows to be good, and worthy of the\r\nservice of God. And as you have carefully marked this, you are desirous\r\nthat the said history should be more fully made known to yourself, and to\r\nthose over whom the Divine Authority has appointed you governor, from your\r\ngreat regard to the common good. But to the end that I may remove all\r\noccasion of doubting what I have written, both from yourself and other\r\nreaders or hearers of this history, I will take care briefly to show you\r\nfrom what authors I chiefly learned the same.\r\n\r\nMy principal authority and aid in this work was the most learned and\r\nreverend Abbot Albinus;(7) who, educated in the Church of Canterbury by\r\nthose venerable and learned men, Archbishop Theodore(8) of blessed memory,\r\nand the Abbot Hadrian,(9) transmitted to me by Nothelm,(10) the pious\r\npriest of the Church of London, either in writing, or by word of mouth of\r\nthe same Nothelm, all that he thought worthy of memory that had been done\r\nin the province of Kent, or the adjacent parts, by the disciples of the\r\nblessed Pope Gregory,(11) as he had learned the same either from written\r\nrecords, or the traditions of his predecessors. The same Nothelm,\r\nafterwards went to Rome, and having, with leave of the present Pope\r\nGregory,(12) searched into the archives of the Holy Roman Church, found\r\nthere some epistles of the blessed Pope Gregory, and other popes; and,\r\nreturning home, by the advice of the aforesaid most reverend father\r\nAlbinus, brought them to me, to be inserted in my history. Thus, from the\r\nbeginning of this volume to the time when the English nation received the\r\nfaith of Christ, we have acquired matter from the writings of former men,\r\ngathered from various sources; but from that time till the present, what\r\nwas transacted in the Church of Canterbury by the disciples of the blessed\r\nPope Gregory or their successors, and under what kings the same happened,\r\nhas been conveyed to us, as we have said, by Nothelm through the industry\r\nof the aforesaid Abbot Albinus. They also partly informed me by what\r\nbishops and under what kings the provinces of the East and West Saxons, as\r\nalso of the East Angles, and of the Northumbrians, received the grace of\r\nthe Gospel. In short, I was chiefly encouraged to undertake this work by\r\nthe exhortations of the same Albinus. In like manner, Daniel,(13) the most\r\nreverend Bishop of the West Saxons, who is still living, communicated to\r\nme in writing some things relating to the Ecclesiastical History of that\r\nprovince, and the adjoining one of the South Saxons, as also of the Isle\r\nof Wight. But how, by the ministry of those holy priests of Christ,\r\nCedd(14) and Ceadda,(15) the province of the Mercians was brought to the\r\nfaith of Christ, which they knew not before, and how that of the East\r\nSaxons recovered the faith after having rejected it, and how those fathers\r\nlived and died, we learned from the brethren of the monastery, which was\r\nbuilt by them, and is called Laestingaeu.(16) Further, what ecclesiastical\r\nmatters took place in the province of the East Angles, was partly made\r\nknown to us from the writings and tradition of former men, and partly by\r\nthe account of the most reverend Abbot Esi.(17) What was done with regard\r\nto the faith of Christ, and what was the episcopal succession in the\r\nprovince of Lindsey,(18) we had either from the letters of the most\r\nreverend prelate Cynibert,(19) or by word of mouth from other persons of\r\ngood credit. But what was done in the Church in the different parts of the\r\nprovince of Northumbria from the time when they received the faith of\r\nChrist till this present, I received not on the authority of any one man,\r\nbut by the faithful testimony of innumerable witnesses, who might know or\r\nremember the same; besides what I had of my own knowledge. Wherein it is\r\nto be observed, that what I have written concerning our most holy father,\r\nBishop Cuthbert,(20) either in this volume, or in my account of his life\r\nand actions, I partly took from what I found written of him by the\r\nbrethren of the Church of Lindisfarne,(21) accepting without reserve the\r\nstatements I found there; but at the same time took care to add such\r\nthings as I could myself have knowledge of by the faithful testimony of\r\ntrustworthy informants. And I humbly entreat the reader, that if he shall\r\nfind in these our writings anything not delivered according to the truth,\r\nhe will not lay the blame of it on me, for, as the true rule of history\r\nrequires, withholding nothing, I have laboured to commit to writing such\r\nthings as I could gather from common report, for the instruction of\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I beseech all men who shall hear or read this history of our\r\nnation, that for my infirmities both of mind and body, they will offer up\r\nfrequent intercessions to the throne of Grace. And I further pray, that in\r\nrecompense for the labour wherewith I have recorded in the several\r\nprovinces and more important places those events which I considered worthy\r\nof note and of interest to their inhabitants, I may for my reward have the\r\nbenefit of their pious prayers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. I. Of the Situation of Britain and Ireland, and of their ancient\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\nBritain, an island in the Atlantic, formerly called Albion, lies to the\r\nnorth-west, facing, though at a considerable distance, the coasts of\r\nGermany, France, and Spain, which form the greatest part of Europe. It\r\nextends 800 miles in length towards the north, and is 200 miles in\r\nbreadth, except where several promontories extend further in breadth, by\r\nwhich its compass is made to be 4,875 miles.(22) To the south lies Belgic\r\nGaul. To its nearest shore there is an easy passage from the city of\r\nRutubi Portus, by the English now corrupted into Reptacaestir.(23) The\r\ndistance from here across the sea to Gessoriacum,(24) the nearest shore in\r\nthe territory of the Morini,(25) is fifty miles, or as some writers say,\r\n450 furlongs. On the other side of the island, where it opens upon the\r\nboundless ocean, it has the islands called Orcades. Britain is rich in\r\ngrain and trees, and is well adapted for feeding cattle and beasts of\r\nburden. It also produces vines in some places, and has plenty of land and\r\nwater fowl of divers sorts; it is remarkable also for rivers abounding in\r\nfish, and plentiful springs. It has the greatest plenty of salmon and\r\neels; seals are also frequently taken, and dolphins, as also whales;\r\nbesides many sorts of shell-fish, such as mussels, in which are often\r\nfound excellent pearls of all colours, red, purple, violet and green, but\r\nchiefly white. There is also a great abundance of snails, of which the\r\nscarlet dye is made, a most beautiful red, which never fades with the heat\r\nof the sun or exposure to rain, but the older it is, the more beautiful it\r\nbecomes. It has both salt and hot springs, and from them flow rivers which\r\nfurnish hot baths, proper for all ages and both sexes, in separate places,\r\naccording to their requirements. For water, as St. Basil says,(26)\r\nreceives the quality of heat, when it runs along certain metals, and\r\nbecomes not only hot but scalding. Britain is rich also in veins of\r\nmetals, as copper, iron, lead, and silver; it produces a great deal of\r\nexcellent jet, which is black and sparkling, and burns when put to the\r\nfire, and when set on fire, drives away serpents; being warmed with\r\nrubbing, it attracts whatever is applied to it, like amber. The island was\r\nformerly distinguished by twenty-eight famous cities, besides innumerable\r\nforts, which were all strongly secured with walls, towers, gates, and\r\nbars. And, because it lies almost under the North Pole, the nights are\r\nlight in summer, so that at midnight the beholders are often in doubt\r\nwhether the evening twilight still continues, or that of the morning has\r\ncome; since the sun at night returns to the east in the northern regions\r\nwithout passing far beneath the earth. For this reason the days are of a\r\ngreat length in summer, and on the other hand, the nights in winter are\r\neighteen hours long, for the sun then withdraws into southern parts. In\r\nlike manner the nights are very short in summer, and the days in winter,\r\nthat is, only six equinoctial hours. Whereas, in Armenia, Macedonia,\r\nItaly, and other countries of the same latitude, the longest day or night\r\nextends but to fifteen hours, and the shortest to nine.\r\n\r\nThere are in the island at present, following the number of the books in\r\nwhich the Divine Law was written, five(27) languages of different nations\r\nemployed in the study and confession of the one self-same knowledge, which\r\nis of highest truth and true sublimity, to wit, English, British,\r\nScottish, Pictish, and Latin, the last having become common to all by the\r\nstudy of the Scriptures. But at first this island had no other inhabitants\r\nbut the Britons, from whom it derived its name, and who, coming over into\r\nBritain, as is reported, from Armorica,(28) possessed themselves of the\r\nsouthern parts thereof. Starting from the south, they had occupied the\r\ngreater part of the island, when it happened, that the nation of the\r\nPicts, putting to sea from Scythia,(29) as is reported, in a few ships of\r\nwar, and being driven by the winds beyond the bounds of Britain, came to\r\nIreland and landed on its northern shores. There, finding the nation of\r\nthe Scots, they begged to be allowed to settle among them, but could not\r\nsucceed in obtaining their request. Ireland is the largest island next to\r\nBritain, and lies to the west of it; but as it is shorter than Britain to\r\nthe north, so, on the other hand, it runs out far beyond it to the south,\r\nover against the northern part of Spain, though a wide sea lies between\r\nthem. The Picts then, as has been said, arriving in this island by sea,\r\ndesired to have a place granted them in which they might settle. The Scots\r\nanswered that the island could not contain them both; but “We can give you\r\ngood counsel,” said they, “whereby you may know what to do; we know there\r\nis another island, not far from ours, to the eastward, which we often see\r\nat a distance, when the days are clear. If you will go thither, you can\r\nobtain settlements; or, if any should oppose you, we will help you.” The\r\nPicts, accordingly, sailing over into Britain, began to inhabit the\r\nnorthern parts thereof, for the Britons had possessed themselves of the\r\nsouthern. Now the Picts had no wives, and asked them of the Scots; who\r\nwould not consent to grant them upon any other terms, than that when any\r\nquestion should arise, they should choose a king from the female royal\r\nrace rather than from the male: which custom, as is well known, has been\r\nobserved among the Picts to this day.(30) In process of time, Britain,\r\nbesides the Britons and the Picts, received a third nation, the Scots,\r\nwho, migrating from Ireland under their leader, Reuda, either by fair\r\nmeans, or by force of arms, secured to themselves those settlements among\r\nthe Picts which they still possess. From the name of their commander, they\r\nare to this day called Dalreudini; for, in their language, Dal signifies a\r\npart.(31)\r\n\r\nIreland is broader than Britain and has a much healthier and milder\r\nclimate; for the snow scarcely ever lies there above three days: no man\r\nmakes hay in the summer for winter’s provision, or builds stables for his\r\nbeasts of burden. No reptiles are found there, and no snake can live\r\nthere; for, though snakes are often carried thither out of Britain, as\r\nsoon as the ship comes near the shore, and the scent of the air reaches\r\nthem, they die. On the contrary, almost all things in the island are\r\nefficacious against poison. In truth, we have known that when men have\r\nbeen bitten by serpents, the scrapings of leaves of books that were\r\nbrought out of Ireland, being put into water, and given them to drink,\r\nhave immediately absorbed the spreading poison, and assuaged the swelling.\r\n\r\nThe island abounds in milk and honey, nor is there any lack of vines,\r\nfish, or fowl; and it is noted for the hunting of stags and roe-deer. It\r\nis properly the country of the Scots, who, migrating from thence, as has\r\nbeen said, formed the third nation in Britain in addition to the Britons\r\nand the Picts.\r\n\r\nThere is a very large gulf of the sea, which formerly divided the nation\r\nof the Britons from the Picts; it runs from the west far into the land,\r\nwhere, to this day, stands a strong city of the Britons, called\r\nAlcluith.(32) The Scots, arriving on the north side of this bay, settled\r\nthemselves there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. II. How Caius Julius Caesar was the first Roman that came into\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow Britain had never been visited by the Romans, and was entirely unknown\r\nto them before the time of Caius Julius Caesar, who, in the year 693 after\r\nthe foundation of Rome, but the sixtieth year(33) before the Incarnation\r\nof our Lord, was consul with Lucius Bibulus. While he was making war upon\r\nthe Germans and the Gauls, who were divided only by the river Rhine, he\r\ncame into the province of the Morini, whence is the nearest and shortest\r\npassage into Britain. Here, having provided about eighty ships of burden\r\nand fast-sailing vessels, he sailed over into Britain; where, being first\r\nroughly handled in a battle, and then caught in a storm, he lost a\r\nconsiderable part of his fleet, no small number of foot-soldiers, and\r\nalmost all his cavalry. Returning into Gaul, he put his legions into\r\nwinter-quarters, and gave orders for building six hundred sail of both\r\nsorts. With these he again crossed over early in spring into Britain, but,\r\nwhilst he was marching with the army against the enemy, the ships, riding\r\nat anchor, were caught in a storm and either dashed one against another,\r\nor driven upon the sands and wrecked. Forty of them were lost, the rest\r\nwere, with much difficulty, repaired. Caesar’s cavalry was, at the first\r\nencounter, defeated by the Britons, and there Labienus, the tribune, was\r\nslain. In the second engagement, with great hazard to his men, he defeated\r\nthe Britons and put them to flight. Thence he proceeded to the river\r\nThames, where a great multitude of the enemy had posted themselves on the\r\nfarther side of the river, under the command of Cassobellaunus,(34) and\r\nfenced the bank of the river and almost all the ford under water with\r\nsharp stakes: the remains of these are to be seen to this day, apparently\r\nabout the thickness of a man’s thigh, cased with lead, and fixed immovably\r\nin the bottom of the river. This being perceived and avoided by the\r\nRomans, the barbarians, not able to stand the charge of the legions, hid\r\nthemselves in the woods, whence they grievously harassed the Romans with\r\nrepeated sallies. In the meantime, the strong state of the\r\nTrinovantes,(35) with their commander Androgius,(36) surrendered to\r\nCaesar, giving him forty hostages. Many other cities, following their\r\nexample, made a treaty with the Romans. Guided by them, Caesar at length,\r\nafter severe fighting, took the town of Cassobellaunus,(37) situated\r\nbetween two marshes, fortified by sheltering woods, and plentifully\r\nfurnished with all necessaries. After this, Caesar returned from Britain\r\ninto Gaul, but he had no sooner put his legions into winter quarters, than\r\nhe was suddenly beset and distracted with wars and sudden risings on every\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. III. How Claudius, the second of the Romans who came into Britain,\r\nbrought the islands Orcades into subjection to the Roman empire; and\r\nVespasian, sent by him, reduced the Isle of Wight under the dominion of\r\nthe Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of Rome 798,(38) Claudius, fourth emperor from Augustus, being\r\ndesirous to approve himself a prince beneficial to the republic, and\r\neagerly bent upon war and conquest on every side, undertook an expedition\r\ninto Britain, which as it appeared, was roused to rebellion by the refusal\r\nof the Romans to give up certain deserters. No one before or after Julius\r\nCaesar had dared to land upon the island. Claudius crossed over to it, and\r\nwithin a very few days, without any fighting or bloodshed, the greater\r\npart of the island was surrendered into his hands. He also added to the\r\nRoman empire the Orcades,(39) which lie in the ocean beyond Britain, and,\r\nreturning to Rome in the sixth month after his departure, he gave his son\r\nthe title of Britannicus. This war he concluded in the fourth year of his\r\nreign, which is the forty-sixth from the Incarnation of our Lord. In which\r\nyear there came to pass a most grievous famine in Syria, which is recorded\r\nin the Acts of the Apostles to have been foretold by the prophet Agabus.\r\n\r\nVespasian,(40) who was emperor after Nero, being sent into Britain by the\r\nsame Claudius, brought also under the Roman dominion the Isle of Wight,\r\nwhich is close to Britain on the south, and is about thirty miles in\r\nlength from east to west, and twelve from north to south; being six miles\r\ndistant from the southern coast of Britain at the east end, and three at\r\nthe west. Nero, succeeding Claudius in the empire, undertook no wars at\r\nall; and, therefore, among countless other disasters brought by him upon\r\nthe Roman state, he almost lost Britain; for in his time two most notable\r\ntowns were there taken and destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. IV. How Lucius, king of Britain, writing to Pope Eleutherus, desired\r\nto be made a Christian.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 156, Marcus Antoninus Verus,(41) the fourteenth\r\nfrom Augustus, was made emperor, together with his brother, Aurelius\r\nCommodus. In their time, whilst the holy Eleutherus presided over the\r\nRoman Church, Lucius, king of Britain, sent a letter to him, entreating\r\nthat by a mandate from him he might be made a Christian.(42) He soon\r\nobtained his pious request, and the Britons preserved the faith, which\r\nthey had received, uncorrupted and entire, in peace and tranquillity until\r\nthe time of the Emperor Diocletian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. V. How the Emperor Severus divided from the rest by a rampart that\r\npart of Britain which had been recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 189, Severus, an African, born at Leptis, in the\r\nprovince of Tripolis, became emperor.(43) He was the seventeenth from\r\nAugustus, and reigned seventeen years. Being naturally of a harsh\r\ndisposition, and engaged in many wars, he governed the state vigorously,\r\nbut with much trouble. Having been victorious in all the grievous civil\r\nwars which happened in his time, he was drawn into Britain by the revolt\r\nof almost all the confederated tribes; and, after many great and severe\r\nbattles, he thought fit to divide that part of the island, which he had\r\nrecovered, from the other unconquered nations, not with a wall, as some\r\nimagine, but with a rampart.(44) For a wall is made of stones, but a\r\nrampart, with which camps are fortified to repel the assaults of enemies,\r\nis made of sods, cut out of the earth, and raised high above the ground,\r\nlike a wall, having in front of it the trench whence the sods were taken,\r\nwith strong stakes of wood fixed above it. Thus Severus drew a great\r\ntrench and strong rampart, fortified with several towers, from sea to sea.\r\nAnd there, at York, he fell sick afterwards and died, leaving two sons,\r\nBassianus and Geta;(45) of whom Geta died, adjudged an enemy of the State;\r\nbut Bassianus, having taken the surname of Antonius, obtained the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. VI. Of the reign of Diocletian, and how he persecuted the\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 286,(46) Diocletian, the thirty-third from\r\nAugustus, and chosen emperor by the army, reigned twenty years, and\r\ncreated Maximian, surnamed Herculius, his colleague in the empire. In\r\ntheir time, one Carausius,(47) of very mean birth, but a man of great\r\nability and energy, being appointed to guard the sea-coasts, then infested\r\nby the Franks and Saxons, acted more to the prejudice than to the\r\nadvantage of the commonwealth, by not restoring to its owners any of the\r\nbooty taken from the robbers, but keeping all to himself; thus giving rise\r\nto the suspicion that by intentional neglect he suffered the enemy to\r\ninfest the frontiers. When, therefore, an order was sent by Maximian that\r\nhe should be put to death, he took upon him the imperial purple, and\r\npossessed himself of Britain, and having most valiantly conquered and held\r\nit for the space of seven years, he was at length put to death by the\r\ntreachery of his associate Allectus.(48) The usurper, having thus got the\r\nisland from Carausius, held it three years, and was then vanquished by\r\nAsclepiodotus,(49) the captain of the Praetorian guards, who thus at the\r\nend of ten years restored Britain to the Roman empire.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Diocletian in the east, and Maximian Herculius in the west,\r\ncommanded the churches to be destroyed, and the Christians to be\r\npersecuted and slain. This persecution was the tenth since the reign of\r\nNero, and was more lasting and cruel than almost any before it; for it was\r\ncarried on incessantly for the space of ten years, with burning of\r\nchurches, proscription of innocent persons, and the slaughter of martyrs.\r\nFinally, Britain also attained to the great glory of bearing faithful\r\nwitness to God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. VII. The Passion of St. Alban and his companions, who at that time\r\nshed their blood for our Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that time suffered St. Alban,(50) of whom the priest Fortunatus,(51) in\r\nthe Praise of Virgins, where he makes mention of the blessed martyrs that\r\ncame to the Lord from all parts of the world, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    And fruitful Britain noble Alban rears.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Alban, being yet a pagan, at the time when at the bidding of\r\nunbelieving rulers all manner of cruelty was practised against the\r\nChristians, gave entertainment in his house to a certain clerk,(52) flying\r\nfrom his persecutors. This man he observed to be engaged in continual\r\nprayer and watching day and night; when on a sudden the Divine grace\r\nshining on him, he began to imitate the example of faith and piety which\r\nwas set before him, and being gradually instructed by his wholesome\r\nadmonitions, he cast off the darkness of idolatry, and became a Christian\r\nin all sincerity of heart. The aforesaid clerk having been some days\r\nentertained by him, it came to the ears of the impious prince, that a\r\nconfessor of Christ, to whom a martyr’s place had not yet been assigned,\r\nwas concealed at Alban’s house. Whereupon he sent some soldiers to make a\r\nstrict search after him. When they came to the martyr’s hut, St. Alban\r\npresently came forth to the soldiers, instead of his guest and master, in\r\nthe habit or long coat which he wore, and was bound and led before the\r\njudge.\r\n\r\nIt happened that the judge, at the time when Alban was carried before him,\r\nwas standing at the altar, and offering sacrifice to devils. When he saw\r\nAlban, being much enraged that he should thus, of his own accord, dare to\r\nput himself into the hands of the soldiers, and incur such danger on\r\nbehalf of the guest whom he had harboured, he commanded him to be dragged\r\nto the images of the devils, before which he stood, saying, “Because you\r\nhave chosen to conceal a rebellious and sacrilegious man, rather than to\r\ndeliver him up to the soldiers, that his contempt of the gods might meet\r\nwith the penalty due to such blasphemy, you shall undergo all the\r\npunishment that was due to him, if you seek to abandon the worship of our\r\nreligion.” But St. Alban, who had voluntarily declared himself a Christian\r\nto the persecutors of the faith, was not at all daunted by the prince’s\r\nthreats, but putting on the armour of spiritual warfare, publicly declared\r\nthat he would not obey his command. Then said the judge, “Of what family\r\nor race are you?”—“What does it concern you,” answered Alban, “of what\r\nstock I am? If you desire to hear the truth of my religion, be it known to\r\nyou, that I am now a Christian, and free to fulfil Christian duties.”—“I\r\nask your name,” said the judge; “tell me it immediately.”—“I am called\r\nAlban by my parents,” replied he; “and I worship ever and adore the true\r\nand living God, Who created all things.” Then the judge, filled with\r\nanger, said, “If you would enjoy the happiness of eternal life, do not\r\ndelay to offer sacrifice to the great gods.” Alban rejoined, “These\r\nsacrifices, which by you are offered to devils, neither can avail the\r\nworshippers, nor fulfil the desires and petitions of the suppliants.\r\nRather, whosoever shall offer sacrifice to these images, shall receive the\r\neverlasting pains of hell for his reward.”\r\n\r\nThe judge, hearing these words, and being much incensed, ordered this holy\r\nconfessor of God to be scourged by the executioners, believing that he\r\nmight by stripes shake that constancy of heart, on which he could not\r\nprevail by words. He, being most cruelly tortured, bore the same\r\npatiently, or rather joyfully, for our Lord’s sake. When the judge\r\nperceived that he was not to be overcome by tortures, or withdrawn from\r\nthe exercise of the Christian religion, he ordered him to be put to death.\r\nBeing led to execution, he came to a river, which, with a most rapid\r\ncourse, ran between the wall of the town and the arena where he was to be\r\nexecuted.(53) He there saw a great multitude of persons of both sexes, and\r\nof divers ages and conditions, who were doubtless assembled by Divine\r\ninspiration, to attend the blessed confessor and martyr, and had so filled\r\nthe bridge over the river, that he could scarce pass over that evening. In\r\ntruth, almost all had gone out, so that the judge remained in the city\r\nwithout attendance. St. Alban, therefore, urged by an ardent and devout\r\nwish to attain the sooner to martyrdom, drew near to the stream, and\r\nlifted up his eyes to heaven, whereupon the channel was immediately dried\r\nup, and he perceived that the water had given place and made way for him\r\nto pass. Among the rest, the executioner, who should have put him to\r\ndeath, observed this, and moved doubtless by Divine inspiration hastened\r\nto meet him at the appointed place of execution, and casting away the\r\nsword which he had carried ready drawn, fell at his feet, praying\r\nearnestly that he might rather be accounted worthy to suffer with the\r\nmartyr, whom he was ordered to execute, or, if possible, instead of him.\r\n\r\nWhilst he was thus changed from a persecutor into a companion in the faith\r\nand truth, and the other executioners rightly hesitated to take up the\r\nsword which was lying on the ground, the holy confessor, accompanied by\r\nthe multitude, ascended a hill, about half a mile from the arena,\r\nbeautiful, as was fitting, and of most pleasing appearance, adorned, or\r\nrather clothed, everywhere with flowers of many colours, nowhere steep or\r\nprecipitous or of sheer descent, but with a long, smooth natural slope,\r\nlike a plain, on its sides, a place altogether worthy from of old, by\r\nreason of its native beauty, to be consecrated by the blood of a blessed\r\nmartyr. On the top of this hill, St. Alban prayed that God would give him\r\nwater, and immediately a living spring, confined in its channel, sprang up\r\nat his feet, so that all men acknowledged that even the stream had yielded\r\nits service to the martyr. For it was impossible that the martyr, who had\r\nleft no water remaining in the river, should desire it on the top of the\r\nhill, unless he thought it fitting. The river then having done service and\r\nfulfilled the pious duty, returned to its natural course, leaving a\r\ntestimony of its obedience.(54) Here, therefore, the head of the undaunted\r\nmartyr was struck off, and here he received the crown of life, which God\r\nhas promised to them that love him. But he who laid impious hands on the\r\nholy man’s neck was not permitted to rejoice over his dead body; for his\r\neyes dropped upon the ground at the same moment as the blessed martyr’s\r\nhead fell.\r\n\r\nAt the same time was also beheaded the soldier, who before, through the\r\nDivine admonition, refused to strike the holy confessor. Of whom it is\r\napparent, that though he was not purified by the waters of baptism, yet he\r\nwas cleansed by the washing of his own blood, and rendered worthy to enter\r\nthe kingdom of heaven. Then the judge, astonished at the unwonted sight of\r\nso many heavenly miracles, ordered the persecution to cease immediately,\r\nand began to honour the death of the saints, by which he once thought that\r\nthey might have been turned from their zeal for the Christian faith. The\r\nblessed Alban suffered death on the twenty-second day of June, near the\r\ncity of Verulam,(55) which is now by the English nation called\r\nVerlamacaestir, or Vaeclingacaestir, where afterwards, when peaceable\r\nChristian times were restored, a church of wonderful workmanship, and\r\naltogether worthy to commemorate his martyrdom, was erected.(56) In which\r\nplace the cure of sick persons and the frequent working of wonders cease\r\nnot to this day.\r\n\r\nAt that time suffered Aaron and Julius,(57) citizens of the City of\r\nLegions,(58) and many more of both sexes in divers places; who, after that\r\nthey had endured sundry torments, and their limbs had been mangled after\r\nan unheard-of manner, when their warfare was accomplished, yielded their\r\nsouls up to the joys of the heavenly city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. VIII. How, when the persecution ceased, the Church in Britain\r\nenjoyed peace till the time of the Arian heresy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the storm of persecution ceased, the faithful Christians, who, during\r\nthe time of danger, had hidden themselves in woods and deserts and secret\r\ncaves, came forth and rebuilt the churches which had been levelled to the\r\nground; founded, erected, and finished the cathedrals raised in honour of\r\nthe holy martyrs, and, as if displaying their conquering standards in all\r\nplaces, celebrated festivals and performed their sacred rites with pure\r\nhearts and lips. This peace continued in the Christian churches of Britain\r\nuntil the time of the Arian madness, which, having corrupted the whole\r\nworld, infected this island also, so far removed from the rest of the\r\nworld, with the poison of its error; and when once a way was opened across\r\nthe sea for that plague, straightway all the taint of every heresy fell\r\nupon the island, ever desirous to hear some new thing, and never holding\r\nfirm to any sure belief.\r\n\r\nAt this time Constantius, who, whilst Diocletian was alive, governed Gaul\r\nand Spain, a man of great clemency and urbanity, died in Britain. This man\r\nleft his son Constantine,(59) born of Helena, his concubine, emperor of\r\nthe Gauls. Eutropius writes that Constantine, being created emperor in\r\nBritain, succeeded his father in the sovereignty. In his time the Arian\r\nheresy broke out, and although it was exposed and condemned in the Council\r\nof Nicaea,(60) nevertheless, the deadly poison of its evil spread, as has\r\nbeen said, to the Churches in the islands, as well as to those of the rest\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. IX. How during the reign of Gratian, Maximus, being created Emperor\r\nin Britain, returned into Gaul with a mighty army.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 377,(61) Gratian, the fortieth from Augustus, held\r\nthe empire for six years after the death of Valens; though he had long\r\nbefore reigned with his uncle Valens, and his brother Valentinian. Finding\r\nthe condition of the commonwealth much impaired, and almost gone to ruin,\r\nand impelled by the necessity of restoring it, he invested the Spaniard,\r\nTheodosius, with the purple at Sirmium, and made him emperor of Thrace and\r\nthe Eastern provinces. At that time, Maximus,(62) a man of energy and\r\nprobity, and worthy of the title of Augustus, if he had not broken his\r\noath of allegiance, was made emperor by the army somewhat against his\r\nwill, passed over into Gaul, and there by treachery slew the Emperor\r\nGratian, who in consternation at his sudden invasion, was attempting to\r\nescape into Italy. His brother, the Emperor Valentinian, expelled from\r\nItaly, fled into the East, where he was entertained by Theodosius with\r\nfatherly affection, and soon restored to the empire, for Maximus the\r\ntyrant, being shut up in Aquileia, was there taken by them and put to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. X. How, in the reign of Arcadius, Pelagius, a Briton, insolently\r\nimpugned the Grace of God.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 394,(63) Arcadius, the son of Theodosius, the\r\nforty-third from Augustus, succeeding to the empire, with his brother\r\nHonorius, held it thirteen years. In his time, Pelagius,(64) a Briton,\r\nspread far and near the infection of his perfidious doctrine, denying the\r\nassistance of the Divine grace, being seconded therein by his associate\r\nJulianus of Campania,(65) who was impelled by an uncontrolled desire to\r\nrecover his bishopric, of which he had been deprived. St. Augustine, and\r\nthe other orthodox fathers, quoted many thousand catholic authorities\r\nagainst them, but failed to amend their folly; nay, more, their madness\r\nbeing rebuked was rather increased by contradiction than suffered by them\r\nto be purified through adherence to the truth; which Prosper, the\r\nrhetorician,(66) has beautifully expressed thus in heroic(67) verse:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    They tell that one, erewhile consumed with gnawing spite,\r\n    snake-like attacked Augustine in his writings. Who urged the\r\n    wretched viper to raise from the ground his head, howsoever hidden\r\n    in dens of darkness? Either the sea-girt Britons reared him with\r\n    the fruit of their soil, or fed on Campanian pastures his heart\r\n    swells with pride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XI. How during the reign of Honorius, Gratian and Constantine were\r\ncreated tyrants in Britain; and soon after the former was slain in\r\nBritain, and the latter in Gaul.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 407,(68) Honorius, the younger son of Theodosius,\r\nand the forty-fourth from Augustus, being emperor, two years before the\r\ninvasion of Rome by Alaric, king of the Goths, when the nations of the\r\nAlani, Suevi, Vandals, and many others with them, having defeated the\r\nFranks and passed the Rhine, ravaged all Gaul, Gratianus, a citizen of the\r\ncountry, was set up as tyrant in Britain and killed. In his place,\r\nConstantine, one of the meanest soldiers, only for the hope afforded by\r\nhis name, and without any worth to recommend him, was chosen emperor. As\r\nsoon as he had taken upon him the command, he crossed over into Gaul,\r\nwhere being often imposed upon by the barbarians with untrustworthy\r\ntreaties, he did more harm than good to the Commonwealth.(69) Whereupon\r\nCount Constantius,(70) by the command of Honorius, marching into Gaul with\r\nan army, besieged him in the city of Arles, took him prisoner, and put him\r\nto death. His son Constans, a monk, whom he had created Caesar, was also\r\nput to death by his own follower Count Gerontius,(71) at Vienne.\r\n\r\nRome was taken by the Goths, in the year from its foundation, 1164.(72)\r\nThen the Romans ceased to rule in Britain, almost 470 years after Caius\r\nJulius Caesar came to the island. They dwelt within the rampart, which, as\r\nwe have mentioned, Severus made across the island, on the south side of\r\nit, as the cities, watch-towers,(73) bridges, and paved roads there made\r\ntestify to this day; but they had a right of dominion over the farther\r\nparts of Britain, as also over the islands that are beyond Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XII. How the Britons, being ravaged by the Scots and Picts, sought\r\nsuccour from the Romans, who coming a second time, built a wall across the\r\nisland; but when this was broken down at once by the aforesaid enemies,\r\nthey were reduced to greater distress than before.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom that time, the British part of Britain, destitute of armed soldiers,\r\nof all military stores, and of the whole flower of its active youth, who\r\nhad been led away by the rashness of the tyrants never to return, was\r\nwholly exposed to rapine, the people being altogether ignorant of the use\r\nof weapons. Whereupon they suffered many years from the sudden invasions\r\nof two very savage nations from beyond the sea, the Scots from the west,\r\nand the Picts from the north. We call these nations from beyond the sea,\r\nnot on account of their being seated out of Britain, but because they were\r\nseparated from that part of it which was possessed by the Britons, two\r\nbroad and long inlets of the sea lying between them, one of which runs\r\ninto the interior of Britain, from the Eastern Sea, and the other from the\r\nWestern, though they do not reach so far as to touch one another. The\r\neastern has in the midst of it the city Giudi.(74) On the Western Sea,\r\nthat is, on its right shore, stands the city of Alcluith,(75) which in\r\ntheir language signifies the Rock Cluith, for it is close by the river of\r\nthat name.\r\n\r\nOn account of the attacks of these nations, the Britons sent messengers to\r\nRome with letters piteously praying for succour, and promising perpetual\r\nsubjection, provided that the impending enemy should be driven away. An\r\narmed legion was immediately sent them, which, arriving in the island, and\r\nengaging the enemy, slew a great multitude of them, drove the rest out of\r\nthe territories of their allies, and having in the meanwhile delivered\r\nthem from their worst distress, advised them to build a wall between the\r\ntwo seas across the island, that it might secure them by keeping off the\r\nenemy. So they returned home with great triumph. But the islanders\r\nbuilding the wall which they had been told to raise, not of stone, since\r\nthey had no workmen capable of such a work, but of sods, made it of no\r\nuse. Nevertheless, they carried it for many miles between the two bays or\r\ninlets of the sea of which we have spoken;(76) to the end that where the\r\nprotection of the water was wanting, they might use the rampart to defend\r\ntheir borders from the irruptions of the enemies. Of the work there\r\nerected, that is, of a rampart of great breadth and height, there are\r\nevident remains to be seen at this day. It begins at about two miles’\r\ndistance from the monastery of Aebbercurnig,(77) west of it, at a place\r\ncalled in the Pictish language Peanfahel,(78) but in the English tongue,\r\nPenneltun, and running westward, ends near the city of Alcluith.\r\n\r\nBut the former enemies, when they perceived that the Roman soldiers were\r\ngone, immediately coming by sea, broke into the borders, trampled and\r\noverran all places, and like men mowing ripe corn, bore down all before\r\nthem. Hereupon messengers were again sent to Rome miserably imploring aid,\r\nlest their wretched country should be utterly blotted out, and the name of\r\na Roman province, so long renowned among them, overthrown by the cruelties\r\nof foreign races, might become utterly contemptible. A legion was\r\naccordingly sent again, and, arriving unexpectedly in autumn, made great\r\nslaughter of the enemy, obliging all those that could escape, to flee\r\nbeyond the sea; whereas before, they were wont yearly to carry off their\r\nbooty without any opposition. Then the Romans declared to the Britons,\r\nthat they could not for the future undertake such troublesome expeditions\r\nfor their sake, and advised them rather to take up arms and make an effort\r\nto engage their enemies, who could not prove too powerful for them, unless\r\nthey themselves were enervated by cowardice. Moreover, thinking that it\r\nmight be some help to the allies, whom they were forced to abandon, they\r\nconstructed a strong stone wall from sea to sea, in a straight line\r\nbetween the towns that had been there built for fear of the enemy, where\r\nSeverus also had formerly built a rampart.(79) This famous wall, which is\r\nstill to be seen, was raised at public and private expense, the Britons\r\nalso lending their assistance. It is eight feet in breadth, and twelve in\r\nheight, in a straight line from east to west, as is still evident to\r\nbeholders. This being presently finished, they gave the dispirited people\r\ngood advice, and showed them how to furnish themselves with arms. Besides,\r\nthey built towers to command a view of the sea, at intervals, on the\r\nsouthern coast, where their ships lay, because there also the invasions of\r\nthe barbarians were apprehended, and so took leave of their allies, never\r\nto return again.\r\n\r\nAfter their departure to their own country, the Scots and Picts,\r\nunderstanding that they had refused to return, at once came back, and\r\ngrowing more confident than they had been before, occupied all the\r\nnorthern and farthest part of the island, driving out the natives, as far\r\nas the wall. Hereupon a timorous guard was placed upon the fortification,\r\nwhere, dazed with fear, they became ever more dispirited day by day. On\r\nthe other side, the enemy constantly attacked them with barbed weapons, by\r\nwhich the cowardly defenders were dragged in piteous fashion from the\r\nwall, and dashed against the ground. At last, the Britons, forsaking their\r\ncities and wall, took to flight and were scattered. The enemy pursued, and\r\nforthwith followed a massacre more grievous than ever before; for the\r\nwretched natives were torn in pieces by their enemies, as lambs are torn\r\nby wild beasts. Thus, being expelled from their dwellings and lands, they\r\nsaved themselves from the immediate danger of starvation by robbing and\r\nplundering one another, adding to the calamities inflicted by the enemy\r\ntheir own domestic broils, till the whole country was left destitute of\r\nfood except such as could be procured in the chase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XIII. How in the reign of Theodosius the younger, in whose time\r\nPalladius was sent to the Scots that believed in Christ, the Britons\r\nbegging assistance of Ætius, the consul, could not obtain it. [446 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 423, Theodosius, the younger, the forty-fifth from\r\nAugustus, succeeded Honorius and governed the Roman empire twenty-six\r\nyears. In the eighth year of his reign,(80) Palladius was sent by\r\nCelestinus, the Roman pontiff, to the Scots that believed in Christ, to be\r\ntheir first bishop. In the twenty-third year of his reign, Aetius,(81) a\r\nman of note and a patrician, discharged his third consulship with\r\nSymmachus for his colleague. To him the wretched remnant of the Britons\r\nsent a letter, which began thus:—“To Aetius, thrice Consul, the groans of\r\nthe Britons.” And in the sequel of the letter they thus unfolded their\r\nwoes:—“The barbarians drive us to the sea; the sea drives us back to the\r\nbarbarians: between them we are exposed to two sorts of death; we are\r\neither slaughtered or drowned.” Yet, for all this, they could not obtain\r\nany help from him, as he was then engaged in most serious wars with Bledla\r\nand Attila, kings of the Huns. And though the year before this(82) Bledla\r\nhad been murdered by the treachery of his own brother Attila, yet Attila\r\nhimself remained so intolerable an enemy to the Republic, that he ravaged\r\nalmost all Europe, attacking and destroying cities and castles. At the\r\nsame time there was a famine at Constantinople, and soon after a plague\r\nfollowed; moreover, a great part of the wall of that city, with\r\nfifty-seven towers, fell to the ground. Many cities also went to ruin, and\r\nthe famine and pestilential state of the air destroyed thousands of men\r\nand cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XIV. How the Britons, compelled by the great famine, drove the\r\nbarbarians out of their territories; and soon after there ensued, along\r\nwith abundance of corn, decay of morals, pestilence, and the downfall of\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the aforesaid famine distressing the Britons more and\r\nmore, and leaving to posterity a lasting memory of its mischievous\r\neffects, obliged many of them to submit themselves to the depredators;\r\nthough others still held out, putting their trust in God, when human help\r\nfailed. These continually made raids from the mountains, caves, and woods,\r\nand, at length, began to inflict severe losses on their enemies, who had\r\nbeen for so many years plundering the country. The bold Irish robbers\r\nthereupon returned home, intending to come again before long. The Picts\r\nthen settled down in the farthest part of the island and afterwards\r\nremained there, but they did not fail to plunder and harass the Britons\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\nNow, when the ravages of the enemy at length abated, the island began to\r\nabound with such plenty of grain as had never been known in any age\r\nbefore; along with plenty, evil living increased, and this was immediately\r\nattended by the taint of all manner of crime; in particular, cruelty,\r\nhatred of truth, and love of falsehood; insomuch, that if any one among\r\nthem happened to be milder than the rest, and more inclined to truth, all\r\nthe rest abhorred and persecuted him unrestrainedly, as if he had been the\r\nenemy of Britain. Nor were the laity only guilty of these things, but even\r\nour Lord’s own flock, with its shepherds, casting off the easy yoke of\r\nChrist, gave themselves up to drunkenness, enmity, quarrels, strife, envy,\r\nand other such sins. In the meantime, on a sudden, a grievous plague fell\r\nupon that corrupt generation, which soon destroyed such numbers of them,\r\nthat the living scarcely availed to bury the dead: yet, those that\r\nsurvived, could not be recalled from the spiritual death, which they had\r\nincurred through their sins, either by the death of their friends, or the\r\nfear of death. Whereupon, not long after, a more severe vengeance for\r\ntheir fearful crimes fell upon the sinful nation. They held a council to\r\ndetermine what was to be done, and where they should seek help to prevent\r\nor repel the cruel and frequent incursions of the northern nations; and in\r\nconcert with their King Vortigern,(83) it was unanimously decided to call\r\nthe Saxons to their aid from beyond the sea, which, as the event plainly\r\nshowed, was brought about by the Lord’s will, that evil might fall upon\r\nthem for their wicked deeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XV. How the Angles, being invited into Britain, at first drove off\r\nthe enemy; but not long after, making a league with them, turned their\r\nweapons against their allies.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 449,(84) Marcian, the forty-sixth from Augustus,\r\nbeing made emperor with Valentinian, ruled the empire seven years. Then\r\nthe nation of the Angles, or Saxons,(85) being invited by the aforesaid\r\nking,(86) arrived in Britain with three ships of war and had a place in\r\nwhich to settle assigned to them by the same king, in the eastern part of\r\nthe island, on the pretext of fighting in defence of their country, whilst\r\ntheir real intentions were to conquer it. Accordingly they engaged with\r\nthe enemy, who were come from the north to give battle, and the Saxons\r\nobtained the victory. When the news of their success and of the fertility\r\nof the country, and the cowardice of the Britons, reached their own home,\r\na more considerable fleet was quickly sent over, bringing a greater number\r\nof men, and these, being added to the former army, made up an invincible\r\nforce. The newcomers received of the Britons a place to inhabit among\r\nthem, upon condition that they should wage war against their enemies for\r\nthe peace and security of the country, whilst the Britons agreed to\r\nfurnish them with pay. Those who came over were of the three most powerful\r\nnations of Germany—Saxons, Angles, and Jutes. From the Jutes are descended\r\nthe people of Kent, and of the Isle of Wight, including those in the\r\nprovince of the West-Saxons who are to this day called Jutes, seated\r\nopposite to the Isle of Wight. From the Saxons, that is, the country which\r\nis now called Old Saxony, came the East-Saxons, the South-Saxons, and the\r\nWest-Saxons. From the Angles, that is, the country which is called\r\nAngulus,(87) and which is said, from that time, to have remained desert to\r\nthis day, between the provinces of the Jutes and the Saxons, are descended\r\nthe East-Angles, the Midland-Angles, the Mercians, all the race of the\r\nNorthumbrians, that is, of those nations that dwell on the north side of\r\nthe river Humber, and the other nations of the Angles. The first\r\ncommanders are said to have been the two brothers Hengist and Horsa. Of\r\nthese Horsa was afterwards slain in battle by the Britons,(88) and a\r\nmonument, bearing his name, is still in existence in the eastern parts of\r\nKent. They were the sons of Victgilsus, whose father was Vitta, son of\r\nVecta, son of Woden; from whose stock the royal race of many provinces\r\ntrace their descent. In a short time, swarms of the aforesaid nations came\r\nover into the island, and the foreigners began to increase so much, that\r\nthey became a source of terror to the natives themselves who had invited\r\nthem. Then, having on a sudden entered into league with the Picts, whom\r\nthey had by this time repelled by force of arms, they began to turn their\r\nweapons against their allies. At first, they obliged them to furnish a\r\ngreater quantity of provisions; and, seeking an occasion of quarrel,\r\nprotested, that unless more plentiful supplies were brought them, they\r\nwould break the league, and ravage all the island; nor were they backward\r\nin putting their threats into execution. In short, the fire kindled by the\r\nhands of the pagans, proved God’s just vengeance for the crimes of the\r\npeople; not unlike that which, being of old lighted by the Chaldeans,\r\nconsumed the walls and all the buildings of Jerusalem. For here, too,\r\nthrough the agency of the pitiless conqueror, yet by the disposal of the\r\njust Judge, it ravaged all the neighbouring cities and country, spread the\r\nconflagration from the eastern to the western sea, without any opposition,\r\nand overran the whole face of the doomed island. Public as well as private\r\nbuildings were overturned; the priests were everywhere slain before the\r\naltars; no respect was shown for office, the prelates with the people were\r\ndestroyed with fire and sword; nor were there any left to bury those who\r\nhad been thus cruelly slaughtered. Some of the miserable remnant, being\r\ntaken in the mountains, were butchered in heaps. Others, spent with\r\nhunger, came forth and submitted themselves to the enemy, to undergo for\r\nthe sake of food perpetual servitude, if they were not killed upon the\r\nspot. Some, with sorrowful hearts, fled beyond the seas. Others, remaining\r\nin their own country, led a miserable life of terror and anxiety of mind\r\namong the mountains, woods and crags.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XVI. How the Britons obtained their first victory over the Angles,\r\nunder the command of Ambrosius, a Roman.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the army of the enemy, having destroyed and dispersed the natives,\r\nhad returned home to their own settlements,(89) the Britons began by\r\ndegrees to take heart, and gather strength, sallying out of the lurking\r\nplaces where they had concealed themselves, and with one accord imploring\r\nthe Divine help, that they might not utterly be destroyed. They had at\r\nthat time for their leader, Ambrosius Aurelianus,(90) a man of worth, who\r\nalone, by chance, of the Roman nation had survived the storm, in which his\r\nparents, who were of the royal race, had perished. Under him the Britons\r\nrevived, and offering battle to the victors, by the help of God, gained\r\nthe victory. From that day, sometimes the natives, and sometimes their\r\nenemies, prevailed, till the year of the siege of Badon-hill,(91) when\r\nthey made no small slaughter of those enemies, about forty-four years\r\nafter their arrival in England. But of this hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XVII. How Germanus the Bishop, sailing into Britain with Lupus,\r\nfirst quelled the tempest of the sea, and afterwards that of the\r\nPelagians, by Divine power. [429 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSome few years before their arrival, the Pelagian heresy, brought over by\r\nAgricola, the son of Severianus,(92) a Pelagian bishop, had corrupted with\r\nits foul taint the faith of the Britons. But whereas they absolutely\r\nrefused to embrace that perverse doctrine, and blaspheme the grace of\r\nChrist, yet were not able of themselves to confute the subtilty of the\r\nunholy belief by force of argument, they bethought them of wholesome\r\ncounsels and determined to crave aid of the Gallican prelates in that\r\nspiritual warfare. Hereupon, these, having assembled a great synod,\r\nconsulted together to determine what persons should be sent thither to\r\nsustain the faith, and by unanimous consent, choice was made of the\r\napostolic prelates, Germanus, Bishop of Auxerre, and Lupus of Troyes,(93)\r\nto go into Britain to confirm the people’s faith in the grace of God. With\r\nready zeal they complied with the request and commands of the Holy Church,\r\nand put to sea. The ship sped safely with favouring winds till they were\r\nhalfway between the coast of Gaul and Britain. There on a sudden they were\r\nobstructed by the malevolence of demons, who were jealous that men of such\r\neminence and piety should be sent to bring back the people to salvation.\r\nThey raised storms, and darkened the sky with clouds. The sails could not\r\nsupport the fury of the winds, the sailors’ skill was forced to give way,\r\nthe ship was sustained by prayer, not by strength, and as it happened,\r\ntheir spiritual leader and bishop, being spent with weariness, had fallen\r\nasleep. Then, as if because resistance flagged, the tempest gathered\r\nstrength, and the ship, overwhelmed by the waves, was ready to sink. Then\r\nthe blessed Lupus and all the rest, greatly troubled, awakened their\r\nelder, that he might oppose the raging elements. He, showing himself the\r\nmore resolute in proportion to the greatness of the danger, called upon\r\nChrist, and having, in the name of the Holy Trinity, taken and sprinkled a\r\nlittle water, quelled the raging waves, admonished his companion,\r\nencouraged all, and all with one consent uplifted their voices in prayer.\r\nDivine help was granted, the enemies were put to flight, a cloudless calm\r\nensued, the winds veering about set themselves again to forward their\r\nvoyage, the sea was soon traversed, and they reached the quiet of the\r\nwished-for shore. A multitude flocking thither from all parts, received\r\nthe bishops, whose coming had been foretold by the predictions even of\r\ntheir adversaries. For the evil spirits declared their fear, and when the\r\nbishops expelled them from the bodies of the possessed, they made known\r\nthe nature of the tempest, and the dangers they had occasioned, and\r\nconfessed that they had been overcome by the merits and authority of these\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the bishops speedily filled the island of Britain with the\r\nfame of their preaching and miracles; and the Word of God was by them\r\ndaily preached, not only in the churches, but even in the streets and\r\nfields, so that the faithful and Catholic were everywhere confirmed, and\r\nthose who had been perverted accepted the way of amendment. Like the\r\nApostles, they acquired honour and authority through a good conscience,\r\nlearning through the study of letters, and the power of working miracles\r\nthrough their merits. Thus the whole country readily came over to their\r\nway of thinking; the authors of the erroneous belief kept themselves in\r\nhiding, and, like evil spirits, grieved for the loss of the people that\r\nwere rescued from them. At length, after long deliberation, they had the\r\nboldness to enter the lists.(94) They came forward in all the splendour of\r\ntheir wealth, with gorgeous apparel, and supported by a numerous\r\nfollowing; choosing rather to hazard the contest, than to undergo among\r\nthe people whom they had led astray, the reproach of having been silenced,\r\nlest they should seem by saying nothing to condemn themselves. An immense\r\nmultitude had been attracted thither with their wives and children. The\r\npeople were present as spectators and judges; the two parties stood there\r\nin very different case; on the one side was Divine faith, on the other\r\nhuman presumption; on the one side piety, on the other pride; on the one\r\nside Pelagius, the founder of their faith, on the other Christ. The\r\nblessed bishops permitted their adversaries to speak first, and their\r\nempty speech long took up the time and filled the ears with meaningless\r\nwords. Then the venerable prelates poured forth the torrent of their\r\neloquence and showered upon them the words of Apostles and Evangelists,\r\nmingling the Scriptures with their own discourse and supporting their\r\nstrongest assertions by the testimony of the written Word. Vainglory was\r\nvanquished and unbelief refuted; and the heretics, at every argument put\r\nbefore them, not being able to reply, confessed their errors. The people,\r\ngiving judgement, could scarce refrain from violence, and signified their\r\nverdict by their acclamations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XVIII. How the some holy man gave sight to the blind daughter of a\r\ntribune, and then coming to St. Alban, there received of his relics, and\r\nleft other relics of the blessed Apostles and other martyrs. [429 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this, a certain man, who held the office of tribune, came forward\r\nwith his wife, and brought his blind daughter, a child of ten years of\r\nage, to be healed of the bishops. They ordered her to be brought to their\r\nadversaries, who, being rebuked by their own conscience, joined their\r\nentreaties to those of the child’s parents, and besought the bishops that\r\nshe might be healed. They, therefore, perceiving their adversaries to\r\nyield, poured forth a short prayer, and then Germanus, full of the Holy\r\nGhost, invoking the Trinity, at once drew from his side a casket which\r\nhung about his neck, containing relics of the saints, and, taking it in\r\nhis hands, applied it in the sight of all to the girl’s eyes, which were\r\nimmediately delivered from darkness and filled with the light of truth.\r\nThe parents rejoiced, and the people were filled with awe at the miracle;\r\nand after that day, the heretical beliefs were so fully obliterated from\r\nthe minds of all, that they thirsted for and sought after the doctrine of\r\nthe bishops.\r\n\r\nThis damnable heresy being thus suppressed, and the authors thereof\r\nconfuted, and all the people settled in the purity of the faith, the\r\nbishops went to the tomb of the martyr, the blessed Alban, to give thanks\r\nto God through him. There Germanus, having with him relics of all the\r\nApostles, and of divers martyrs, after offering up his prayers, commanded\r\nthe tomb to be opened, that he might lay therein the precious gifts;\r\njudging it fitting, that the limbs of saints brought together from divers\r\ncountries, as their equal merits had procured them admission into heaven,\r\nshould find shelter in one tomb. These being honourably bestowed, and laid\r\ntogether, he took up a handful of dust from the place where the blessed\r\nmartyr’s blood had been shed, to carry away with him. In this dust the\r\nblood had been preserved, showing that the slaughter of the martyrs was\r\nred, though the persecutor was pale in death.(95) In consequence of these\r\nthings, an innumerable multitude of people was that day converted to the\r\nLord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XIX. How the same holy man, being detained there by sickness, by his\r\nprayers quenched a fire that had broken out among the houses, and was\r\nhimself cured of his infirmity by a vision. [429 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs they were returning thence, the treacherous enemy, having, as it\r\nchanced, prepared a snare, caused Germanus to bruise his foot by a fall,\r\nnot knowing that, as it was with the blessed Job, his merits would be but\r\nincreased by bodily affliction. Whilst he was thus detained some time in\r\nthe same place by his infirmity, a fire broke out in a cottage\r\nneighbouring to that in which he was; and having burned down the other\r\nhouses which were thatched with reed, fanned by the wind, was carried on\r\nto the dwelling in which he lay. The people all flocked to the prelate,\r\nentreating that they might lift him in their arms, and save him from the\r\nimpending danger. But he rebuked them, and in the assurance of his faith,\r\nwould not suffer himself to be removed. The whole multitude, in terror and\r\ndespair, ran to oppose the conflagration; but, for the greater\r\nmanifestation of the Divine power, whatsoever the crowd endeavoured to\r\nsave, was destroyed; and what the sick and helpless man defended, the\r\nflame avoided and passed by, though the house that sheltered the holy man\r\nlay open to it,(96) and while the fire raged on every side, the place in\r\nwhich he lay appeared untouched, amid the general conflagration. The\r\nmultitude rejoiced at the miracle, and was gladly vanquished by the power\r\nof God. A great crowd of people watched day and night before the humble\r\ncottage; some to have their souls healed, and some their bodies. All that\r\nChrist wrought in the person of his servant, all the wonders the sick man\r\nperformed cannot be told. Moreover, he would suffer no medicines to be\r\napplied to his infirmity; but one night he saw one clad in garments as\r\nwhite as snow, standing by him, who reaching out his hand, seemed to raise\r\nhim up, and ordered him to stand firm upon his feet; from which time his\r\npain ceased, and he was so perfectly restored, that when the day came,\r\nwith good courage he set forth upon his journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XX. How the same Bishops brought help from Heaven to the Britons in\r\na battle, and then returned home. [430 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Saxons and Picts, with their united forces, made war\r\nupon the Britons, who in these straits were compelled to take up arms. In\r\ntheir terror thinking themselves unequal to their enemies, they implored\r\nthe assistance of the holy bishops; who, hastening to them as they had\r\npromised, inspired so much confidence into these fearful people, that one\r\nwould have thought they had been joined by a mighty army. Thus, by these\r\napostolic leaders, Christ Himself commanded in their camp. The holy days\r\nof Lent were also at hand, and were rendered more sacred by the presence\r\nof the bishops, insomuch that the people being instructed by daily\r\nsermons, came together eagerly to receive the grace of baptism. For a\r\ngreat multitude of the army desired admission to the saving waters, and a\r\nwattled church was constructed for the Feast of the Resurrection of our\r\nLord, and so fitted up for the army in the field as if it were in a city.\r\nStill wet with the baptismal water the troops set forth; the faith of the\r\npeople was fired; and where arms had been deemed of no avail, they looked\r\nto the help of God. News reached the enemy of the manner and method of\r\ntheir purification,(97) who, assured of success, as if they had to deal\r\nwith an unarmed host, hastened forward with renewed eagerness. But their\r\napproach was made known by scouts. When, after the celebration of Easter,\r\nthe greater part of the army, fresh from the font, began to take up arms\r\nand prepare for war, Germanus offered to be their leader. He picked out\r\nthe most active, explored the country round about, and observed, in the\r\nway by which the enemy was expected, a valley encompassed by hills(98) of\r\nmoderate height. In that place he drew up his untried troops, himself\r\nacting as their general. And now a formidable host of foes drew near,\r\nvisible, as they approached, to his men lying in ambush. Then, on a\r\nsudden, Germanus, bearing the standard, exhorted his men, and bade them\r\nall in a loud voice repeat his words. As the enemy advanced in all\r\nsecurity, thinking to take them by surprise, the bishops three times\r\ncried, “Hallelujah.” A universal shout of the same word followed, and the\r\nechoes from the surrounding hills gave back the cry on all sides, the\r\nenemy was panic-stricken, fearing, not only the neighbouring rocks, but\r\neven the very frame of heaven above them; and such was their terror, that\r\ntheir feet were not swift enough to save them. They fled in disorder,\r\ncasting away their arms, and well satisfied if, even with unprotected\r\nbodies, they could escape the danger; many of them, flying headlong in\r\ntheir fear, were engulfed by the river which they had crossed. The\r\nBritons, without a blow, inactive spectators of the victory they had\r\ngained, beheld their vengeance complete. The scattered spoils were\r\ngathered up, and the devout soldiers rejoiced in the success which Heaven\r\nhad granted them. The prelates thus triumphed over the enemy without\r\nbloodshed, and gained a victory by faith, without the aid of human force.\r\nThus, having settled the affairs of the island, and restored tranquillity\r\nby the defeat of the invisible foes, as well as of enemies in the flesh,\r\nthey prepared to return home. Their own merits, and the intercession of\r\nthe blessed martyr Alban, obtained for them a calm passage, and the happy\r\nvessel restored them in peace to the desires of their people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXI. How, when the Pelagian heresy began to spring up afresh,\r\nGermanus, returning to Britain with Severus, first restored bodily\r\nstrength to a lame youth, then spiritual health to the people of God,\r\nhaving condemned or converted the Heretics. [447 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNot long after, news was brought from the same island, that certain\r\npersons were again attempting to teach and spread abroad the Pelagian\r\nheresy, and again the holy Germanus was entreated by all the priests, that\r\nhe would defend the cause of God, which he had before maintained. He\r\nspeedily complied with their request; and taking with him Severus,(99) a\r\nman of singular sanctity, who was disciple to the blessed father, Lupus,\r\nbishop of Troyes, and at that time, having been ordained bishop of the\r\nTreveri, was preaching the Word of God to the tribes of Upper Germany, put\r\nto sea, and with favouring winds and calm waters sailed to Britain.(100)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the evil spirits, speeding through the whole island, were\r\nconstrained against their will to foretell that Germanus was coming,\r\ninsomuch, that one Elafius, a chief of that region, without tidings from\r\nany visible messenger, hastened to meet the holy men, carrying with him\r\nhis son, who in the very flower of his youth laboured under a grievous\r\ninfirmity; for the sinews of the knee were wasted and shrunk, so that the\r\nwithered limb was denied the power to walk. All the country followed this\r\nElafius. The bishops arrived, and were met by the ignorant multitude, whom\r\nthey blessed, and preached the Word of God to them. They found the people\r\nconstant in the faith as they had left them; and learning that but few had\r\ngone astray, they sought out the authors of the evil and condemned them.\r\nThen suddenly Elafius cast himself at the feet of the bishops, presenting\r\nhis son, whose distress was visible and needed no words to express it. All\r\nwere grieved, but especially the bishops, who, filled with pity, invoked\r\nthe mercy of God; and straightway the blessed Germanus, causing the youth\r\nto sit down, touched the bent and feeble knee and passed his healing hand\r\nover all the diseased part. At once health was restored by the power of\r\nhis touch, the withered limb regained its vigour, the sinews resumed their\r\ntask, and the youth was, in the presence of all the people, delivered\r\nwhole to his father. The multitude was amazed at the miracle, and the\r\nCatholic faith was firmly established in the hearts of all; after which,\r\nthey were, in a sermon, exhorted to amend their error. By the judgement of\r\nall, the exponents of the heresy, who had been banished from the island,\r\nwere brought before the bishops, to be conveyed into the continent, that\r\nthe country might be rid of them, and they corrected of their errors. So\r\nit came to pass that the faith in those parts continued long after pure\r\nand untainted. Thus when they had settled all things, the blessed prelates\r\nreturned home as prosperously as they had come.\r\n\r\nBut Germanus, after this, went to Ravenna to intercede for the\r\ntranquillity of the Armoricans,(101) where, after being very honourably\r\nreceived by Valentinian and his mother, Placidia, he departed hence to\r\nChrist; his body was conveyed to his own city with a splendid retinue, and\r\nmighty works attended his passage to the grave. Not long after,\r\nValentinian was murdered by the followers of Aetius, the patrician, whom\r\nhe had put to death, in the sixth(102) year of the reign of Marcian, and\r\nwith him ended the empire of the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXII. How the Britons, being for a time at rest from foreign\r\ninvasions, wore themselves out by civil wars, and at the same time gave\r\nthemselves up to more heinous crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, in Britain, there was some respite from foreign, but not\r\nfrom civil war. The cities destroyed by the enemy and abandoned remained\r\nin ruins; and the natives, who had escaped the enemy, now fought against\r\neach other. Nevertheless, the kings, priests, private men, and the\r\nnobility, still remembering the late calamities and slaughters, in some\r\nmeasure kept within bounds; but when these died, and another generation\r\nsucceeded, which knew nothing of those times, and was only acquainted with\r\nthe existing peaceable state of things, all the bonds of truth and justice\r\nwere so entirely broken, that there was not only no trace of them\r\nremaining, but only very few persons seemed to retain any memory of them\r\nat all. To other crimes beyond description, which their own historian,\r\nGildas,(103) mournfully relates, they added this—that they never preached\r\nthe faith to the Saxons, or English, who dwelt amongst them. Nevertheless,\r\nthe goodness of God did not forsake his people, whom he foreknew, but sent\r\nto the aforesaid nation much more worthy heralds of the truth, to bring it\r\nto the faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXIII. How the holy Pope Gregory sent Augustine, with other monks,\r\nto preach to the English nation, and encouraged them by a letter of\r\nexhortation, not to desist from their labour. [596 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 582, Maurice, the fifty-fourth from Augustus,\r\nascended the throne, and reigned twenty-one years. In the tenth year of\r\nhis reign, Gregory,(104) a man eminent in learning and the conduct of\r\naffairs, was promoted to the Apostolic see of Rome, and presided over it\r\nthirteen years, six months and ten days. He, being moved by Divine\r\ninspiration, in the fourteenth year of the same emperor, and about the one\r\nhundred and fiftieth after the coming of the English into Britain, sent\r\nthe servant of God, Augustine,(105) and with him divers other monks, who\r\nfeared the Lord, to preach the Word of God to the English nation. They\r\nhaving, in obedience to the pope’s commands, undertaken that work, when\r\nthey had gone but a little way on their journey, were seized with craven\r\nterror, and began to think of returning home, rather than proceed to a\r\nbarbarous, fierce, and unbelieving nation, to whose very language they\r\nwere strangers; and by common consent they decided that this was the safer\r\ncourse. At once Augustine, who had been appointed to be consecrated\r\nbishop, if they should be received by the English, was sent back, that he\r\nmight, by humble entreaty, obtain of the blessed Gregory, that they should\r\nnot be compelled to undertake so dangerous, toilsome, and uncertain a\r\njourney. The pope, in reply, sent them a letter of exhortation, persuading\r\nthem to set forth to the work of the Divine Word, and rely on the help of\r\nGod. The purport of which letter was as follows:\r\n\r\n“_Gregory, the servant of the servants of God, to the servants of our\r\nLord._ Forasmuch as it had been better not to begin a good work, than to\r\nthink of desisting from one which has been begun, it behoves you, my\r\nbeloved sons, to fulfil with all diligence the good work, which, by the\r\nhelp of the Lord, you have undertaken. Let not, therefore, the toil of the\r\njourney, nor the tongues of evil-speaking men, discourage you; but with\r\nall earnestness and zeal perform, by God’s guidance, that which you have\r\nset about; being assured, that great labour is followed by the greater\r\nglory of an eternal reward. When Augustine, your Superior, returns, whom\r\nwe also constitute your abbot, humbly obey him in all things; knowing,\r\nthat whatsoever you shall do by his direction, will, in all respects, be\r\nprofitable to your souls. Almighty God protect you with His grace, and\r\ngrant that I may, in the heavenly country, see the fruits of your labour,\r\ninasmuch as, though I cannot labour with you, I shall partake in the joy\r\nof the reward, because I am willing to labour. God keep you in safety, my\r\nmost beloved sons. Given the 23rd of July, in the fourteenth year of the\r\nreign of our most religious lord, Mauritius Tiberius Augustus, the\r\nthirteenth year after the consulship of our lord aforesaid, and the\r\nfourteenth indiction.”(106)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXIV. How he wrote to the bishop of Arles to entertain them. [596\r\nA.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same venerable pope also sent at the same time a letter to Aetherius,\r\narchbishop of Arles,(107) exhorting him to give favourable entertainment\r\nto Augustine on his way to Britain; which letter was in these words:\r\n\r\n“_To his most reverend and holy brother and fellow bishop Aetherius,\r\nGregory, the servant of the servants of God._ Although religious men stand\r\nin need of no recommendation with priests who have the charity which is\r\npleasing to God; yet because an opportunity of writing has occurred, we\r\nhave thought fit to send this letter to you, Brother, to inform you, that\r\nwith the help of God we have directed thither, for the good of souls, the\r\nbearer of these presents, Augustine, the servant of God, of whose zeal we\r\nare assured, with other servants of God, whom it is requisite that your\r\nHoliness readily assist with priestly zeal, affording him all the comfort\r\nin your power. And to the end that you may be the more ready in your help,\r\nwe have enjoined him to inform you particularly of the occasion of his\r\ncoming; knowing, that when you are acquainted with it, you will, as the\r\nmatter requires, for the sake of God, dutifully dispose yourself to give\r\nhim comfort. We also in all things recommend to your charity,\r\nCandidus,(108) the priest, our common son, whom we have transferred to the\r\nadministration of a small patrimony in our Church. God keep you in safety,\r\nmost reverend brother. Given the 23rd day of July, in the fourteenth year\r\nof the reign of our most religious lord, Mauritius Tiberius Augustus, the\r\nthirteenth year after the consulship of our lord aforesaid, and the\r\nfourteenth indiction.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXV. How Augustine, coming into Britain, first preached in the Isle\r\nof Thanet to the King of Kent, and having obtained licence from him, went\r\ninto Kent, in order to preach therein. [597 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAugustine, thus strengthened by the encouragement of the blessed Father\r\nGregory, returned to the work of the Word of God, with the servants of\r\nChrist who were with him, and arrived in Britain. The powerful Ethelbert\r\nwas at that time king of Kent;(109) he had extended his dominions as far\r\nas the boundary formed by the great river Humber, by which the Southern\r\nSaxons are divided from the Northern. On the east of Kent is the large\r\nIsle of Thanet, containing, according to the English way of reckoning, 600\r\nfamilies,(110) divided from the mainland by the river Wantsum,(111) which\r\nis about three furlongs in breadth, and which can be crossed only in two\r\nplaces; for at both ends it runs into the sea. On this island landed(112)\r\nthe servant of the Lord, Augustine, and his companions, being, as is\r\nreported, nearly forty men. They had obtained, by order of the blessed\r\nPope Gregory, interpreters of the nation of the Franks,(113) and sending\r\nto Ethelbert, signified that they were come from Rome, and brought a\r\njoyful message, which most undoubtedly assured to those that hearkened to\r\nit everlasting joys in heaven, and a kingdom that would never end, with\r\nthe living and true God. The king hearing this, gave orders that they\r\nshould stay in the island where they had landed, and be furnished with\r\nnecessaries, till he should consider what to do with them. For he had\r\nbefore heard of the Christian religion, having a Christian wife of the\r\nroyal family of the Franks, called Bertha;(114) whom he had received from\r\nher parents, upon condition that she should be permitted to preserve\r\ninviolate the rites of her religion with the Bishop Liudhard,(115) who was\r\nsent with her to support her in the faith. Some days after, the king came\r\ninto the island, and sitting in the open air, ordered Augustine and his\r\ncompanions to come and hold a conference with him. For he had taken\r\nprecaution that they should not come to him in any house, lest, by so\r\ncoming, according to an ancient superstition, if they practised any\r\nmagical arts, they might impose upon him, and so get the better of him.\r\nBut they came endued with Divine, not with magic power, bearing a silver\r\ncross for their banner, and the image of our Lord and Saviour painted on a\r\nboard; and chanting litanies, they offered up their prayers to the Lord\r\nfor the eternal salvation both of themselves and of those to whom and for\r\nwhom they had come. When they had sat down, in obedience to the king’s\r\ncommands, and preached to him and his attendants there present the Word of\r\nlife, the king answered thus: “Your words and promises are fair, but\r\nbecause they are new to us, and of uncertain import, I cannot consent to\r\nthem so far as to forsake that which I have so long observed with the\r\nwhole English nation. But because you are come from far as strangers into\r\nmy kingdom, and, as I conceive, are desirous to impart to us those things\r\nwhich you believe to be true, and most beneficial, we desire not to harm\r\nyou, but will give you favourable entertainment, and take care to supply\r\nyou with all things necessary to your sustenance; nor do we forbid you to\r\npreach and gain as many as you can to your religion.” Accordingly he gave\r\nthem an abode in the city of Canterbury,(116) which was the metropolis of\r\nall his dominions, and, as he had promised, besides supplying them with\r\nsustenance, did not refuse them liberty to preach. It is told that, as\r\nthey drew near to the city, after their manner, with the holy cross, and\r\nthe image of our sovereign Lord and King, Jesus Christ, they sang in\r\nconcert this litany: “We beseech thee, O Lord, for Thy great mercy, that\r\nThy wrath and anger be turned away from this city, and from Thy holy\r\nhouse, for we have sinned. Hallelujah.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXVI. How St. Augustine in Kent followed the doctrine and manner of\r\nlife of the primitive Church, and settled his episcopal see in the royal\r\ncity. [597 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as they entered the dwelling-place assigned to them, they began to\r\nimitate the Apostolic manner of life in the primitive Church; applying\r\nthemselves to constant prayer, watchings, and fastings; preaching the Word\r\nof life to as many as they could; despising all worldly things, as in\r\nnowise concerning them; receiving only their necessary food from those\r\nthey taught; living themselves in all respects conformably to what they\r\ntaught, and being always ready to suffer any adversity, and even to die\r\nfor that truth which they preached. In brief, some believed and were\r\nbaptized, admiring the simplicity of their blameless life, and the\r\nsweetness of their heavenly doctrine. There was on the east side of the\r\ncity, a church dedicated of old to the honour of St. Martin,(117) built\r\nwhilst the Romans were still in the island, wherein the queen, who, as has\r\nbeen said before, was a Christian, was wont to pray. In this they also\r\nfirst began to come together, to chant the Psalms, to pray, to celebrate\r\nMass, to preach, and to baptize, till when the king had been converted to\r\nthe faith, they obtained greater liberty to preach everywhere and build or\r\nrepair churches.\r\n\r\nWhen he, among the rest, believed and was baptized, attracted by the pure\r\nlife of these holy men and their gracious promises, the truth of which\r\nthey established by many miracles, greater numbers began daily to flock\r\ntogether to hear the Word, and, forsaking their heathen rites, to have\r\nfellowship, through faith, in the unity of Christ’s Holy Church. It is\r\ntold that the king, while he rejoiced at their conversion and their faith,\r\nyet compelled none to embrace Christianity, but only showed more affection\r\nto the believers, as to his fellow citizens in the kingdom of Heaven. For\r\nhe had learned from those who had instructed him and guided him to\r\nsalvation, that the service of Christ ought to be voluntary, not by\r\ncompulsion. Nor was it long before he gave his teachers a settled\r\nresidence suited to their degree in his metropolis of Canterbury, with\r\nsuch possessions of divers sorts as were necessary for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXVII. How St. Augustine, being made a bishop, sent to acquaint Pope\r\nGregory with what had been done in Britain, and asked and received\r\nreplies, of which he stood in need. [597-601 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Augustine, the man of God, went to Arles, and, according\r\nto the orders received from the holy Father Gregory, was ordained\r\narchbishop of the English nation,(118) by Aetherius,(119) archbishop of\r\nthat city. Then returning into Britain, he sent Laurentius the the\r\npriest(120) and Peter the monk(121) to Rome, to acquaint Pope Gregory,\r\nthat the English nation had received the faith of Christ, and that he was\r\nhimself made their bishop. At the same time, he desired his solution of\r\nsome doubts which seemed urgent to him. He soon received fitting answers\r\nto his questions, which we have also thought meet to insert in this our\r\nhistory:\r\n\r\n_The First Question of the blessed Augustine, Bishop of the Church of\r\nCanterbury._—Concerning bishops, what should be their manner of\r\nconversation towards their clergy? or into how many portions the offerings\r\nof the faithful at the altar are to be divided? and how the bishop is to\r\nact in the Church?\r\n\r\n_Gregory, Pope of the City of Rome, answers._—Holy Scripture, in which we\r\ndoubt not you are well versed, testifies to this, and in particular the\r\nEpistles of the Blessed Paul to Timothy, wherein he endeavours to show him\r\nwhat should be his manner of conversation in the house of God; but it is\r\nthe custom of the Apostolic see to prescribe these rules to bishops when\r\nthey are ordained: that all emoluments which accrue, are to be divided\r\ninto four portions;—one for the bishop and his household, for hospitality\r\nand entertainment of guests; another for the clergy; a third for the poor;\r\nand the fourth for the repair of churches. But in that you, my brother,\r\nhaving been instructed in monastic rules, must not live apart from your\r\nclergy in the Church of the English, which has been lately, by the will of\r\nGod, converted to the faith, you must establish the manner of conversation\r\nof our fathers in the primitive Church, among whom, none said that aught\r\nof the things which they possessed was his own, but they had all things\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nBut if there are any clerks not received into holy orders,(122) who cannot\r\nlive continent, they are to take wives, and receive their stipends outside\r\nof the community; because we know that it is written concerning the same\r\nfathers of whom we have spoken that a distribution was made unto every man\r\naccording as he had need. Care is also to be taken of their stipends, and\r\nprovision to be made, and they are to be kept under ecclesiastical rule,\r\nthat they may live orderly, and attend to singing of psalms, and, by the\r\nhelp of God, preserve their hearts and tongues and bodies from all that is\r\nunlawful. But as for those that live in common, there is no need to say\r\nanything of assigning portions, or dispensing hospitality and showing\r\nmercy; inasmuch as all that they have over is to be spent in pious and\r\nreligious works, according to the teaching of Him who is the Lord and\r\nMaster of all, “Give alms of such things as ye have over, and behold all\r\nthings are clean unto you.”(123)\r\n\r\n_Augustine’s Second Question._—Whereas the faith is one and the same, are\r\nthere different customs in different Churches? and is one custom of Masses\r\nobserved in the holy Roman Church, and another in the Church of Gaul?(124)\r\n\r\n_Pope Gregory answers._—You know, my brother, the custom of the Roman\r\nChurch in which you remember that you were bred up. But my will is, that\r\nif you have found anything, either in the Roman, or the Gallican, or any\r\nother Church, which may be more acceptable to Almighty God, you should\r\ncarefully make choice of the same, and sedulously teach the Church of the\r\nEnglish, which as yet is new in the faith, whatsoever you can gather from\r\nthe several Churches. For things are not to be loved for the sake of\r\nplaces, but places for the sake of good things. Choose, therefore, from\r\nevery Church those things that are pious, religious, and right, and when\r\nyou have, as it were, made them up into one bundle, let the minds of the\r\nEnglish be accustomed thereto.\r\n\r\n_Augustine’s Third Question._—I beseech you, what punishment must be\r\ninflicted on one who steals anything from a church?\r\n\r\n_Gregory answers._—You may judge, my brother, by the condition of the\r\nthief, in what manner he is to be corrected. For there are some, who,\r\nhaving substance, commit theft; and there are others, who transgress in\r\nthis matter through want. Wherefore it is requisite, that some be punished\r\nwith fines, others with stripes; some with more severity, and some more\r\nmildly. And when the severity is greater, it is to proceed from charity,\r\nnot from anger; because this is done for the sake of him who is corrected,\r\nthat he may not be delivered up to the fires of Hell. For it behoves us to\r\nmaintain discipline among the faithful, as good parents do with their\r\nchildren according to the flesh, whom they punish with stripes for their\r\nfaults, and yet they design to make those whom they chastise their heirs,\r\nand preserve their possessions for those whom they seem to visit in wrath.\r\nThis charity is, therefore, to be kept in mind, and it dictates the\r\nmeasure of the punishment, so that the mind may do nothing beyond the rule\r\nprescribed by reason. You will add to this, how men are to restore those\r\nthings which they have stolen from the church. But let not the Church take\r\nmore than it has lost of its worldly possessions, or seek gain from\r\nvanities.\r\n\r\n_Augustine’s Fourth Question._—Whether two full brothers may marry two\r\nsisters, who are of a family far removed from them?\r\n\r\n_Gregory answers._—Most assuredly this may lawfully be done; for nothing\r\nis found in Holy Writ on this matter that seems to contradict it.\r\n\r\n_Augustine’s Fifth Question._—To what degree may the faithful marry with\r\ntheir kindred? and is it lawful to marry a stepmother or a brother’s wife?\r\n\r\n_Gregory answers._—A certain secular law in the Roman commonwealth allows,\r\nthat the son and daughter of a brother and sister,(125) or of two full\r\nbrothers, or two sisters, may be joined in matrimony; but we have found,\r\nby experience, that the offspring of such wedlock cannot grow up; and the\r\nDivine law forbids a man to “uncover the nakedness of his kindred.” Hence\r\nof necessity it must be the third or fourth generation of the faithful,\r\nthat can be lawfully joined in matrimony; for the second, which we have\r\nmentioned, must altogether abstain from one another. To marry with one’s\r\nstepmother is a heinous crime, because it is written in the Law, “Thou\r\nshalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father:” now the son, indeed,\r\ncannot uncover his father’s nakedness; but in regard that it is written,\r\n“They twain shall be one flesh,” he that presumes to uncover the nakedness\r\nof his stepmother, who was one flesh with his father, certainly uncovers\r\nthe nakedness of his father. It is also prohibited to marry with a\r\nsister-in-law, because by the former union she is become the brother’s\r\nflesh. For which thing also John the Baptist was beheaded, and obtained\r\nthe crown of holy martyrdom. For, though he was not ordered to deny\r\nChrist, and it was not for confessing Christ that he was killed, yet\r\ninasmuch as the same Jesus Christ, our Lord, said, “I am the Truth,”\r\nbecause John was killed for the truth, he also shed his blood for Christ.\r\n\r\nBut forasmuch as there are many of the English, who, whilst they were\r\nstill heathens, are said to have been joined in this unholy union, when\r\nthey attain to the faith they are to be admonished to abstain, and be made\r\nto know that this is a grievous sin. Let them fear the dread judgement of\r\nGod, lest, for the gratification of their carnal desires, they incur the\r\ntorments of eternal punishment. Yet they are not on this account to be\r\ndeprived of the Communion of the Body and Blood of Christ, lest they\r\nshould seem to be punished for those things which they did through\r\nignorance before they had received Baptism. For in these times the Holy\r\nChurch chastises some things with zeal, and tolerates some in mercy, and\r\nis blind to some in her wisdom, and so, by forbearance and blindness often\r\nsuppresses the evil that stands in her way. But all that come to the faith\r\nare to be admonished not to presume to do such things. And if any shall be\r\nguilty of them, they are to be excluded from the Communion of the Body and\r\nBlood of Christ. For as the offence is, in some measure, to be tolerated\r\nin those who did it through ignorance, so it is to be rigorously punished\r\nin those who do not fear to sin knowingly.\r\n\r\n_Augustine’s Sixth Question._—Whether a bishop may be consecrated without\r\nother bishops being present, if there be so great a distance between them,\r\nthat they cannot easily come together?\r\n\r\n_Gregory answers._—In the Church of England, of which you are as yet the\r\nonly bishop, you cannot otherwise ordain a bishop than in the absence of\r\nother bishops. For when do bishops come over from Gaul, that they may be\r\npresent as witnesses to you in ordaining a bishop? But we would have you,\r\nmy brother, to ordain bishops in such a manner, that the said bishops may\r\nnot be far asunder, to the end that there be no lack, but that at the\r\nordination of a bishop other pastors also, whose presence is of great\r\nbenefit, should easily come together.(126) Thus, when, by the help of God,\r\nbishops shall have been ordained in places near to one another, no\r\nordination of a bishop is to take place without assembling three or four\r\nbishops. For, even in spiritual affairs, we may take example by the\r\ntemporal, that they may be wisely and discreetly conducted. For surely,\r\nwhen marriages are celebrated in the world, some married persons are\r\nassembled, that those who went before in the way of matrimony, may also\r\npartake in the joy of the new union. Why, then, at this spiritual\r\nordinance, wherein, by means of the sacred ministry, man is joined to God,\r\nshould not such persons be assembled, as may either rejoice in the\r\nadvancement of the new bishop, or jointly pour forth their prayers to\r\nAlmighty God for his preservation?\r\n\r\n_Augustine’s Seventh Question._—How are we to deal with the bishops of\r\nGaul and Britain?\r\n\r\n_Gregory answers._—We give you no authority over the bishops of Gaul,\r\nbecause the bishop of Arles received the pall(127) in the old times of my\r\npredecessors, and we must by no means deprive him of the authority he has\r\nreceived. If it shall therefore happen, my brother, that you go over into\r\nthe province of Gaul, you are to concert with the said bishop of Arles,\r\nhow, if there be any faults among the bishops, they may be amended. And if\r\nhe shall be lukewarm in keeping up discipline, he is to be fired by your\r\nzeal; to whom we have also written, that aided by the presence of your\r\nHoliness in Gaul, he should exert himself to the utmost, and put away from\r\nthe behaviour of the bishops all that is opposed to the command of our\r\nCreator. But you shall not have power to go beyond your own authority and\r\njudge the bishops of Gaul, but by persuading, and winning them, and\r\nshowing good works for them to imitate, you shall recall the perverted to\r\nthe pursuit of holiness; for it is written in the Law, “When thou comest\r\ninto the standing corn of thy neighbour, then thou mayest bruise the ears\r\nwith thine hand and eat; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy\r\nneighbours’ standing corn.”(128) For thou mayest not apply the sickle of\r\njudgement in that harvest which thou seest to have been committed to\r\nanother; but by the influence of good works thou shalt clear the Lord’s\r\nwheat of the chaff of its vices, and convert it by exhortation and\r\npersuasion in the body of the Church, as it were, by eating. But\r\nwhatsoever is to be done by authority, must be transacted with the\r\naforesaid bishop of Arles, lest that should be omitted, which the ancient\r\ninstitution of the fathers has appointed.(129) But as for all the bishops\r\nof Britain, we commit them to your care, that the unlearned may be taught,\r\nthe weak strengthened by persuasion, and the perverse corrected by\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n_Augustine’s Eighth Question._—Whether a woman with child ought to be\r\nbaptized? Or when she has brought forth, after what time she may come into\r\nthe church? As also, after how many days the infant born may be baptized,\r\nlest he be prevented by death? Or how long after her husband may have\r\ncarnal knowledge of her? Or whether it is lawful for her to come into the\r\nchurch when she has her courses, or to receive the Sacrament of Holy\r\nCommunion? Or whether a man, under certain circumstances, may come into\r\nthe church before he has washed with water? Or approach to receive the\r\nMystery of the Holy Communion? All which things are requisite to be known\r\nby the ignorant nation of the English.\r\n\r\n_Gregory answers._—I do not doubt but that these questions have been put\r\nto you, my brother, and I think I have already answered you therein. But I\r\nbelieve you would wish the opinion which you yourself might give and hold\r\nto be confirmed by my reply also. Why should not a woman with child be\r\nbaptized, since the fruitfulness of the flesh is no offence in the eyes of\r\nAlmighty God? For when our first parents sinned in Paradise, they\r\nforfeited the immortality which they had received, by the just judgement\r\nof God. Because, therefore, Almighty God would not for their fault wholly\r\ndestroy the human race, he both deprived man of immortality for his sin,\r\nand, at the same time, of his great goodness and loving-kindness, reserved\r\nto him the power of propagating his race after him. On what ground, then,\r\ncan that which is preserved to human nature by the free gift of Almighty\r\nGod, be excluded from the privilege of Holy Baptism? For it is very\r\nfoolish to imagine that the gift can be opposed to grace in that Mystery\r\nin which all sin is blotted out. When a woman is delivered, after how many\r\ndays she may come into the church, you have learnt from the teaching of\r\nthe Old Testament, to wit, that she is to abstain for a male child\r\nthirty-three days, and sixty-six for a female. Now you must know that this\r\nis to be received in a mystery; for if she enters the church the very hour\r\nthat she is delivered, to return thanks, she is not guilty of any sin;\r\nbecause the pleasure of the flesh is a fault, and not the pain; but the\r\npleasure is in the copulation of the flesh, whereas there is pain in\r\nbringing forth the child. Wherefore it is said to the first mother of all,\r\n“In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children.” If, therefore, we forbid a\r\nwoman that has brought forth, to enter the church, we make a crime of her\r\nvery punishment. To baptize either a woman who has brought forth, if there\r\nbe danger of death, even the very hour that she brings forth, or that\r\nwhich she has brought forth the very hour it is born, is in no way\r\nprohibited, because, as the grace of the Holy Mystery is to be with much\r\ndiscretion provided for those who are in full life and capable of\r\nunderstanding, so is it to be without any delay administered to the dying;\r\nlest, while a further time is sought to confer the Mystery of redemption,\r\nif a small delay intervene, the person that is to be redeemed be dead and\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nHer husband is not to approach her, till the infant born be weaned. An\r\nevil custom is sprung up in the lives of married people, in that women\r\ndisdain to suckle the children whom they bring forth, and give them to\r\nother women to suckle; which seems to have been invented on no other\r\naccount but incontinency; because, as they will not be continent, they\r\nwill not suckle the children whom they bear. Those women, therefore, who,\r\nfrom evil custom, give their children to others to bring up, must not\r\napproach their husbands till the time of purification is past. For even\r\nwhen there has been no child-birth, women are forbidden to do so, whilst\r\nthey have their courses, insomuch that the Law condemns to death any man\r\nthat shall approach unto a woman during her uncleanness. Yet the woman,\r\nnevertheless, must not be forbidden to come into the church whilst she has\r\nher courses; because the superfluity of nature cannot be imputed to her as\r\na crime; and it is not just that she should be refused admittance into the\r\nchurch, for that which she suffers against her will. For we know, that the\r\nwoman who had the issue of blood, humbly approaching behind our Lord’s\r\nback, touched the hem of his garment, and her infirmity immediately\r\ndeparted from her. If, therefore, she that had an issue of blood might\r\ncommendably touch the garment of our Lord, why may not she, who has her\r\ncourses, lawfully enter into the church of God? But you may say, Her\r\ninfirmity compelled her, whereas these we speak of are bound by custom.\r\nConsider, then, most dear brother, that all we suffer in this mortal\r\nflesh, through the infirmity of our nature, is ordained by the just\r\njudgement of God after the fall; for to hunger, to thirst, to be hot, to\r\nbe cold, to be weary, is from the infirmity of our nature; and what else\r\nis it to seek food against hunger, drink against thirst, air against heat,\r\nclothes against cold, rest against weariness, than to procure a remedy\r\nagainst distempers? Thus to a woman her courses are a distemper. If,\r\ntherefore, it was a commendable boldness in her, who in her disease\r\ntouched our Lord’s garment, why may not that which is allowed to one\r\ninfirm person, be granted to all women, who, through the fault of their\r\nnature, are rendered infirm?\r\n\r\nShe must not, therefore, be forbidden to receive the Mystery of the Holy\r\nCommunion during those days. But if any one out of profound respect does\r\nnot presume to do it, she is to be commended; yet if she receives it, she\r\nis not to be judged. For it is the part of noble minds in some manner to\r\nacknowledge their faults, even when there is no fault; because very often\r\nthat is done without a fault, which, nevertheless, proceeded from a fault.\r\nThus, when we are hungry, it is no sin to eat; yet our being hungry\r\nproceeds from the sin of the first man. The courses are no sin in women,\r\nbecause they happen naturally; yet, because our nature itself is so\r\ndepraved, that it appears to be defiled even without the concurrence of\r\nthe will, a defect arises from sin, and thereby human nature may itself\r\nknow what it is become by judgement. And let man, who wilfully committed\r\nthe offence, bear the guilt of that offence against his will. And,\r\ntherefore, let women consider with themselves, and if they do not presume,\r\nduring their courses, to approach the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of\r\nour Lord, they are to be commended for their praiseworthy consideration;\r\nbut when they are carried away with love of the same Mystery to receive it\r\naccording to the custom of the religious life, they are not to be\r\nrestrained, as we said before. For as in the Old Testament the outward\r\nworks are observed, so in the New Testament, that which is outwardly done,\r\nis not so diligently regarded as that which is inwardly thought, that the\r\npunishment may be with discernment. For whereas the Law forbids the eating\r\nof many things as unclean, yet our Lord says in the Gospel, “Not that\r\nwhich goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of\r\nthe mouth, this defileth a man.” And afterwards he added, expounding the\r\nsame, “Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts.” Where it is abundantly\r\nshown, that that is declared by Almighty God to be polluted in deed, which\r\nsprings from the root of a polluted thought. Whence also Paul the Apostle\r\nsays, “Unto the pure all things are pure, but unto them that are defiled\r\nand unbelieving, nothing is pure.” And presently, declaring the cause of\r\nthat defilement, he adds, “For even their mind and conscience is defiled.”\r\nIf, therefore, meat is not unclean to him whose mind is not unclean, why\r\nshall that which a woman suffers according to nature, with a clean mind,\r\nbe imputed to her as uncleanness?\r\n\r\nA man who has approached his own wife is not to enter the church unless\r\nwashed with water, nor is he to enter immediately although washed. The Law\r\nprescribed to the ancient people, that a man in such cases should be\r\nwashed with water, and not enter into the church before the setting of the\r\nsun. Which, nevertheless, may be understood spiritually, because a man\r\nacts so when the mind is led by the imagination to unlawful concupiscence;\r\nfor unless the fire of concupiscence be first driven from his mind, he is\r\nnot to think himself worthy of the congregation of the brethren, while he\r\nsees himself burdened by the iniquity of a perverted will. For though\r\ndivers nations have divers opinions concerning this affair, and seem to\r\nobserve different rules, it was always the custom of the Romans, from\r\nancient times, for such an one to seek to be cleansed by washing, and for\r\nsome time reverently to forbear entering the church. Nor do we, in so\r\nsaying, assign matrimony to be a fault; but forasmuch as lawful\r\nintercourse cannot be had without the pleasure of the flesh, it is proper\r\nto forbear entering the holy place, because the pleasure itself cannot be\r\nwithout a fault. For he was not born of adultery or fornication, but of\r\nlawful marriage, who said, “Behold I was conceived in iniquity, and in sin\r\nmy mother brought me forth.” For he who knew himself to have been\r\nconceived in iniquity, lamented that he was born from sin, because he\r\nbears the defect, as a tree bears in its bough the sap it drew from the\r\nroot. In which words, however, he does not call the union of the married\r\ncouple iniquity, but the will itself. For there are many things which are\r\nlawful and permitted, and yet we are somewhat defiled in doing them. As\r\nvery often by being angry we correct faults, and at the same time disturb\r\nour own peace of mind; and though that which we do is right, yet it is not\r\nto be approved that our mind should be disturbed. For he who said, “My eye\r\nwas disturbed with anger,” had been angry at the vices of sinners. Now,\r\nseeing that only a calm mind can rest in the light of contemplation, he\r\ngrieved that his eye was disturbed with anger; because, whilst he was\r\ncorrecting evil actions below, he was obliged to be confused and disturbed\r\nwith regard to the contemplation of the highest things. Anger against vice\r\nis, therefore, commendable, and yet painful to a man, because he thinks\r\nthat by his mind being agitated, he has incurred some guilt. Lawful\r\ncommerce, therefore, must be for the sake of children, not of pleasure;\r\nand must be to procure offspring, not to satisfy vices. But if any man is\r\nled not by the desire of pleasure, but only for the sake of getting\r\nchildren, such a man is certainly to be left to his own judgement, either\r\nas to entering the church, or as to receiving the Mystery of the Body and\r\nBlood of our Lord, which he, who being placed in the fire cannot burn, is\r\nnot to be forbidden by us to receive. But when, not the love of getting\r\nchildren, but of pleasure prevails, the pair have cause to lament their\r\ndeed. For this the holy preaching concedes to them, and yet fills the mind\r\nwith dread of the very concession. For when Paul the Apostle said, “Let\r\nhim that cannot contain have his own wife;” he presently took care to\r\nsubjoin, “But this I say by way of permission, not of commandment.” For\r\nthat is not granted by way of permission which is lawful, because it is\r\njust; and, therefore, that which he said he permitted, he showed to be an\r\noffence.\r\n\r\nIt is seriously to be considered, that when God was about to speak to the\r\npeople on Mount Sinai, He first commanded them to abstain from women. And\r\nif purity of body was there so carefully required, where God spoke to the\r\npeople by the means of a creature as His representative, that those who\r\nwere to hear the words of God should abstain; how much more ought women,\r\nwho receive the Body of Almighty God, to preserve themselves in purity of\r\nflesh, lest they be burdened with the very greatness of that inestimable\r\nMystery? For this reason also, it was said to David, concerning his men,\r\nby the priest, that if they were clean in this particular, they should\r\nreceive the shewbread, which they would not have received at all, had not\r\nDavid first declared them to be clean. Then the man, who, afterwards, has\r\nbeen washed with water, is also capable of receiving the Mystery of the\r\nHoly Communion, when it is lawful for him, according to what has been\r\nbefore declared, to enter the church.\r\n\r\n_Augustine’s Ninth Question._—Whether after an illusion, such as is wont\r\nto happen in a dream, any man may receive the Body of our Lord, or if he\r\nbe a priest, celebrate the Divine Mysteries?\r\n\r\n_Gregory answers._—The Testament of the Old Law, as has been said already\r\nin the article above, calls such a man polluted, and allows him not to\r\nenter into the church till the evening, after being washed with water.\r\nWhich, nevertheless, a spiritual people, taking in another sense, will\r\nunderstand in the same manner as above; because he is imposed upon as it\r\nwere in a dream, who, being tempted with uncleanness, is defiled by real\r\nrepresentations in thought, and he is to be washed with water, that he may\r\ncleanse away the sins of thought with tears; and unless the fire of\r\ntemptation depart before, may know himself to be in a manner guilty until\r\nthe evening. But a distinction is very necessary in that illusion, and one\r\nmust carefully consider what causes it to arise in the mind of the person\r\nsleeping; for sometimes it proceeds from excess of eating or drinking;\r\nsometimes from the superfluity or infirmity of nature, and sometimes from\r\nthe thoughts. And when it happens either through superfluity or infirmity\r\nof nature, such an illusion is not to be feared at all, because it is to\r\nbe lamented, that the mind of the person, who knew nothing of it, suffers\r\nthe same, rather than that he occasioned it. But when the appetite of\r\ngluttony commits excess in food, and thereupon the receptacles of the\r\nhumours are oppressed, the mind thence contracts some guilt; yet not so\r\nmuch as to hinder the receiving of the Holy Mystery, or celebrating Mass,\r\nwhen a holy day requires it, or necessity obliges the Mystery to be shown\r\nforth, because there is no other priest in the place; for if there be\r\nothers who can perform the ministry, the illusion proceeding from\r\nover-eating ought not to exclude a man from receiving the sacred Mystery;\r\nbut I am of opinion he ought humbly to abstain from offering the sacrifice\r\nof the Mystery, but not from receiving it, unless the mind of the person\r\nsleeping has been disturbed with some foul imagination. For there are\r\nsome, who for the most part so suffer the illusion, that their mind, even\r\nduring the sleep of the body, is not defiled with filthy thoughts. In\r\nwhich case, one thing is evident, that the mind is guilty, not being\r\nacquitted even in its own judgement; for though it does not remember to\r\nhave seen anything whilst the body was sleeping, yet it calls to mind\r\nthat, when the body was awake, it fell into gluttony. But if the illusion\r\nof the sleeper proceeds from evil thoughts when he was awake, then its\r\nguilt is manifest to the mind; for the man perceives from what root that\r\ndefilement sprang, because what he had consciously thought of, that he\r\nafterwards unconsciously endured. But it is to be considered, whether that\r\nthought was no more than a suggestion, or proceeded to delight, or, what\r\nis worse, consented to sin. For all sin is committed in three ways, viz.,\r\nby suggestion, by delight, and by consent. Suggestion comes from the\r\nDevil, delight from the flesh, and consent from the spirit. For the\r\nserpent suggested the first offence, and Eve, as flesh, took delight in\r\nit, but Adam, as the spirit, consented. And when the mind sits in\r\njudgement on itself, it must clearly distinguish between suggestion and\r\ndelight, and between delight and consent. For when the evil spirit\r\nsuggests a sin to the mind, if there ensue no delight in the sin, the sin\r\nis in no way committed; but when the flesh begins to take delight in it,\r\nthen sin begins to arise. But if it deliberately consents, then the sin is\r\nknown to be full-grown. The seed, therefore, of sin is in the suggestion,\r\nthe nourishment of it in delight, its maturity in the consent. And it\r\noften happens that what the evil spirit sows in the thought, in that the\r\nflesh begins to find delight, and yet the soul does not consent to that\r\ndelight. And whereas the flesh cannot be delighted without the mind, yet\r\nthe mind struggling against the pleasures of the flesh, is after a manner\r\nunwillingly bound by the carnal delight, so that through reason it opposes\r\nit, and does not consent, yet being bound by delight, it grievously\r\nlaments being so bound. Wherefore that great soldier of our Lord’s host,\r\ngroaned and said, “I see another law in my members warring against the law\r\nof my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin, which is in\r\nmy members.” Now if he was a captive, he did not fight; but he did fight;\r\nwherefore he was a captive and at the same time therefore fought against\r\nthe law of the mind, which the law that is in the members opposed; but if\r\nhe fought, he was no captive. Thus, then, man is, as I may say, a captive\r\nand yet free. Free on account of justice, which he loves, a captive by the\r\ndelight which he unwillingly bears within him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXVIII. How Pope Gregory wrote to the bishop of Arles to help\r\nAugustine in the work of God. [601 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far the answers of the holy Pope Gregory, to the questions of the\r\nmost reverend prelate, Augustine. Now the letter, which he says he had\r\nwritten to the bishop of Arles, was directed to Vergilius, successor to\r\nAetherius,(130) and was in the following words:\r\n\r\n“_To his most reverend and holy brother and fellow bishop, Vergilius;\r\nGregory, servant of the servants of God._ With how much kindness brethren,\r\ncoming of their own accord, are to be entertained, is shown by this, that\r\nthey are for the most part invited for the sake of brotherly love.\r\nTherefore, if our common brother, Bishop Augustine, shall happen to come\r\nto you, let your love, as is becoming, receive him with so great kindness\r\nand affection, that it may refresh him by the benefit of its consolation\r\nand show to others how brotherly charity is to be cultivated. And, since\r\nit often happens that those who are at a distance first learn from others\r\nthe things that need correction, if he bring before you, my brother, any\r\nsins of bishops or others, do you, in conjunction with him, carefully\r\ninquire into the same, and show yourself so strict and earnest with regard\r\nto those things which offend God and provoke His wrath, that for the\r\namendment of others, the punishment may fall upon the guilty, and the\r\ninnocent may not suffer under false report. God keep you in safety, most\r\nreverend brother. Given the 22nd day of June, in the nineteenth year of\r\nthe reign of our most religious lord, Mauritius Tiberius Augustus, the\r\neighteenth year after the consulship of our said lord, and the fourth\r\nindiction.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXIX. How the same Pope sent to Augustine the Pall and a letter,\r\nalong with several ministers of the Word. [601 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, the same Pope Gregory, hearing from Bishop Augustine, that the\r\nharvest which he had was great and the labourers but few, sent to him,\r\ntogether with his aforesaid envoys, certain fellow labourers and ministers\r\nof the Word, of whom the chief and foremost were Mellitus, Justus,\r\nPaulinus, and Rufinianus,(131) and by them all things in general that were\r\nnecessary for the worship and service of the Church, to wit, sacred\r\nvessels and altar-cloths, also church-furniture, and vestments for the\r\nbishops and clerks, as likewise relics of the holy Apostles and martyrs;\r\nbesides many manuscripts. He also sent a letter, wherein he signified that\r\nhe had despatched the pall to him, and at the same time directed how he\r\nshould constitute bishops in Britain. The letter was in these words:\r\n\r\n“_To his most reverend and holy brother and fellow bishop, Augustine;\r\nGregory, the servant of the servants of God._ Though it be certain, that\r\nthe unspeakable rewards of the eternal kingdom are reserved for those who\r\nlabour for Almighty God, yet it is requisite that we bestow on them the\r\nbenefit of honours, to the end that they may by this recompense be\r\nencouraged the more vigorously to apply themselves to the care of their\r\nspiritual work. And, seeing that the new Church of the English is, through\r\nthe bounty of the Lord, and your labours, brought to the grace of God, we\r\ngrant you the use of the pall in the same, only for the celebration of the\r\nsolemn service of the Mass; that so you may ordain twelve bishops in\r\ndifferent places, who shall be subject to your jurisdiction. But the\r\nbishop of London shall, for the future, be always consecrated by his own\r\nsynod, and receive the pall, which is the token of his office, from this\r\nholy and Apostolic see, which I, by the grace of God, now serve. But we\r\nwould have you send to the city of York such a bishop as you shall think\r\nfit to ordain; yet so, that if that city, with the places adjoining, shall\r\nreceive the Word of God, that bishop shall also ordain twelve bishops, and\r\nenjoy the honour of a metropolitan; for we design, if we live, by the help\r\nof God, to bestow on him also the pall; and yet we would have him to be\r\nsubject to your authority, my brother; but after your decease, he shall so\r\npreside over the bishops he shall have ordained, as to be in no way\r\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the bishop of London. But for the future\r\nlet there be this distinction as regards honour between the bishops of the\r\ncities of London and York, that he who has been first ordained have the\r\nprecedence.(132) But let them take counsel and act in concert and with one\r\nmind dispose whatsoever is to be done for zeal of Christ; let them judge\r\nrightly, and carry out their judgement without dissension.\r\n\r\n“But to you, my brother, shall, by the authority of our God and Lord Jesus\r\nChrist, be subject not only those bishops whom you shall ordain, and those\r\nthat shall be ordained by the bishop of York, but also all the prelates in\r\nBritain; to the end that from the words and manner of life of your\r\nHoliness they may learn the rule of a right belief and a good life, and\r\nfulfilling their office in faith and righteousness, they may, when it\r\nshall please the Lord, attain to the kingdom of Heaven. God preserve you\r\nin safety, most reverend brother.\r\n\r\n“Given the 22nd of June, in the nineteenth year of the reign of our most\r\nreligious lord, Mauritius Tiberius Augustus, the eighteenth year after the\r\nconsulship of our said lord, and the fourth indiction.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXX. A copy of the letter which Pope Gregory sent to the Abbot\r\nMellitus, then going into Britain. [601 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aforesaid envoys having departed, the blessed Father Gregory sent\r\nafter them a letter worthy to be recorded, wherein he plainly shows how\r\ncarefully he watched over the salvation of our country. The letter was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“_To his most beloved son, the Abbot Mellitus; Gregory, the servant of the\r\nservants of God._ We have been much concerned, since the departure of our\r\npeople that are with you, because we have received no account of the\r\nsuccess of your journey. Howbeit, when Almighty God has led you to the\r\nmost reverend Bishop Augustine, our brother, tell him what I have long\r\nbeen considering in my own mind concerning the matter of the English\r\npeople; to wit, that the temples of the idols in that nation ought not to\r\nbe destroyed; but let the idols that are in them be destroyed; let water\r\nbe consecrated and sprinkled in the said temples, let altars be erected,\r\nand relics placed there. For if those temples are well built, it is\r\nrequisite that they be converted from the worship of devils to the service\r\nof the true God; that the nation, seeing that their temples are not\r\ndestroyed, may remove error from their hearts, and knowing and adoring the\r\ntrue God, may the more freely resort to the places to which they have been\r\naccustomed. And because they are used to slaughter many oxen in sacrifice\r\nto devils, some solemnity must be given them in exchange for this, as that\r\non the day of the dedication, or the nativities of the holy martyrs, whose\r\nrelics are there deposited, they should build themselves huts of the\r\nboughs of trees about those churches which have been turned to that use\r\nfrom being temples, and celebrate the solemnity with religious feasting,\r\nand no more offer animals to the Devil, but kill cattle and glorify God in\r\ntheir feast, and return thanks to the Giver of all things for their\r\nabundance; to the end that, whilst some outward gratifications are\r\nretained, they may the more easily consent to the inward joys. For there\r\nis no doubt that it is impossible to cut off every thing at once from\r\ntheir rude natures; because he who endeavours to ascend to the highest\r\nplace rises by degrees or steps, and not by leaps. Thus the Lord made\r\nHimself known to the people of Israel in Egypt; and yet He allowed them\r\nthe use, in His own worship, of the sacrifices which they were wont to\r\noffer to the Devil, commanding them in His sacrifice to kill animals, to\r\nthe end that, with changed hearts, they might lay aside one part of the\r\nsacrifice, whilst they retained another; and although the animals were the\r\nsame as those which they were wont to offer, they should offer them to the\r\ntrue God, and not to idols; and thus they would no longer be the same\r\nsacrifices. This then, dearly beloved, it behoves you to communicate to\r\nour aforesaid brother, that he, being placed where he is at present, may\r\nconsider how he is to order all things. God preserve you in safety, most\r\nbeloved son.\r\n\r\n“Given the 17th of June,(133) in the nineteenth year of the reign of our\r\nmost religious lord, Mauritius Tiberius Augustus, the eighteenth year\r\nafter the consulship of our said lord, and the fourth indiction.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXXI. How Pope Gregory, by letter, exhorted Augustine not to glory\r\nin his miracles. [601 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt which time he also sent Augustine a letter concerning the miracles that\r\nhe had heard had been wrought by him; wherein he admonishes him not to\r\nincur the danger of being puffed up by the number of them. The letter was\r\nin these words:\r\n\r\n“I know, dearly beloved brother, that Almighty God, by means of you, shows\r\nforth great miracles to the nation which it was His will to choose.\r\nWherefore you must needs rejoice with fear, and fear with joy concerning\r\nthat heavenly gift; for you will rejoice because the souls of the English\r\nare by outward miracles drawn to inward grace; but you will fear, lest,\r\namidst the wonders that are wrought, the weak mind may be puffed up with\r\nself-esteem, and that whereby it is outwardly raised to honour cause it\r\ninwardly to fall through vain-glory. For we must call to mind, that when\r\nthe disciples returned with joy from preaching, and said to their Heavenly\r\nMaster, ‘Lord, even the devils are subject to us through Thy Name;’\r\nforthwith they received the reply, ‘In this rejoice not; but rather\r\nrejoice, because your names are written in heaven.’(134) For their minds\r\nwere set on private and temporal joys, when they rejoiced in miracles; but\r\nthey are recalled from the private to the common joy, and from the\r\ntemporal to the eternal, when it is said to them, ‘Rejoice in this,\r\nbecause your names are written in heaven.’ For all the elect do not work\r\nmiracles, and yet the names of all are written in heaven. For those who\r\nare disciples of the truth ought not to rejoice, save for that good thing\r\nwhich all men enjoy as well as they, and in which their joy shall be\r\nwithout end.\r\n\r\n“It remains, therefore, most dear brother, that amidst those outward\r\nactions, which you perform through the power of the Lord, you should\r\nalways carefully judge yourself in your heart, and carefully understand\r\nboth what you are yourself, and how much grace is bestowed upon that same\r\nnation, for the conversion of which you have received even the gift of\r\nworking miracles. And if you remember that you have at any time sinned\r\nagainst our Creator, either by word or deed, always call it to mind, to\r\nthe end that the remembrance of your guilt may crush the vanity which\r\nrises in your heart. And whatsoever gift of working miracles you either\r\nshall receive, or have received, consider the same, not as conferred on\r\nyou, but on those for whose salvation it has been given you.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXXII. How Pope Gregory sent letters and gifts to King Ethelbert.\r\n[601 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same blessed Pope Gregory, at the same time, sent a letter to King\r\nEthelbert, with many gifts of divers sorts; being desirous to glorify the\r\nking with temporal honours, at the same time that he rejoiced that through\r\nhis own labour and zeal he had attained to the knowledge of heavenly\r\nglory. The copy of the said letter is as follows:\r\n\r\n“_To the most glorious lord, and his most excellent son, Ethelbert, king\r\nof the English, Bishop Gregory._ Almighty God advances good men to the\r\ngovernment of nations, that He may by their means bestow the gifts of His\r\nloving-kindness on those over whom they are placed. This we know to have\r\ncome to pass in the English nation, over whom your Highness was placed, to\r\nthe end, that by means of the blessings which are granted to you, heavenly\r\nbenefits might also be conferred on your subjects. Therefore, my\r\nillustrious son, do you carefully guard the grace which you have received\r\nfrom the Divine goodness, and be eager to spread the Christian faith among\r\nthe people under your rule; in all uprightness increase your zeal for\r\ntheir conversion; suppress the worship of idols; overthrow the structures\r\nof the temples; establish the manners of your subjects by much cleanness\r\nof life, exhorting, terrifying, winning, correcting, and showing forth an\r\nexample of good works, that you may obtain your reward in Heaven from Him,\r\nWhose Name and the knowledge of Whom you have spread abroad upon earth.\r\nFor He, Whose honour you seek and maintain among the nations, will also\r\nrender your Majesty’s name more glorious even to posterity.\r\n\r\n“For even so the most pious emperor, Constantine, of old, recovering the\r\nRoman commonwealth from the false worship of idols, brought it with\r\nhimself into subjection to Almighty God, our Lord Jesus Christ, and turned\r\nto Him with his whole mind, together with the nations under his rule.\r\nWhence it followed, that his praises transcended the fame of former\r\nprinces; and he excelled his predecessors in renown as much as in good\r\nworks. Now, therefore, let your Highness hasten to impart to the kings and\r\npeoples that are subject to you, the knowledge of one God, Father, Son,\r\nand Holy Ghost; that you may surpass the ancient kings of your nation in\r\npraise and merit, and while you cause the sins of others among your own\r\nsubjects to be blotted out, become the more free from anxiety with regard\r\nto your own sins before the dread judgement of Almighty God.\r\n\r\n“Willingly hear, devoutly perform, and studiously retain in your memory,\r\nwhatsoever counsel shall be given you by our most reverend brother, Bishop\r\nAugustine, who is trained up in the monastic rule, full of the knowledge\r\nof Holy Scripture, and, by the help of God, endued with good works; for if\r\nyou give ear to him when he speaks on behalf of Almighty God, the sooner\r\nwill Almighty God hear his prayers for you. But if (which God forbid!) you\r\nslight his words, how shall Almighty God hear him on your behalf, when you\r\nneglect to hear him on behalf of God? Unite yourself, therefore, to him\r\nwith all your mind, in the fervour of faith, and further his endeavours,\r\nby that virtue which God has given you, that He may make you partaker of\r\nHis kingdom, Whose faith you cause to be received and maintained in your\r\nown.\r\n\r\n“Besides, we would have your Highness know that, as we find in Holy\r\nScripture from the words of the Almighty Lord, the end of this present\r\nworld, and the kingdom of the saints, which will never come to an end, is\r\nat hand. But as the end of the world draws near, many things are about to\r\ncome upon us which were not before, to wit, changes in the air, and\r\nterrors from heaven, and tempests out of the order of the seasons, wars,\r\nfamines, pestilences, earthquakes in divers places; which things will not,\r\nnevertheless, all happen in our days, but will all follow after our days.\r\nIf, therefore, you perceive that any of these things come to pass in your\r\ncountry, let not your mind be in any way disturbed; for these signs of the\r\nend of the world are sent before, for this reason, that we may take heed\r\nto our souls, and be watchful for the hour of death, and may be found\r\nprepared with good works to meet our Judge. Thus much, my illustrious son,\r\nI have said in few words, with intent that when the Christian faith is\r\nspread abroad in your kingdom, our discourse to you may also be more\r\ncopious, and we may desire to say the more, as joy for the full conversion\r\nof your nation is increased in our mind.\r\n\r\n“I have sent you some small gifts, which will not appear small to you,\r\nwhen received by you with the blessing of the blessed Apostle, Peter. May\r\nAlmighty God, therefore, perfect in you His grace which He has begun, and\r\nprolong your life here through a course of many years, and in the fulness\r\nof time receive you into the congregation of the heavenly country. May the\r\ngrace of God preserve you in safety, my most excellent lord and son.\r\n\r\n“Given the 22nd day of June, in the nineteenth year of the reign of our\r\nmost religious lord, Mauritius Tiberius Augustus, in the eighteenth year\r\nafter his consulship, and the fourth indiction.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXXIII. How Augustine repaired the church of our Saviour, and built\r\nthe monastery of the blessed Peter the Apostle; and concerning Peter the\r\nfirst abbot of the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugustine having had his episcopal see granted him in the royal city, as\r\nhas been said, recovered therein, with the support of the king, a church,\r\nwhich he was informed had been built of old by the faithful among the\r\nRomans, and consecrated it in the name of the Holy Saviour, our Divine\r\nLord Jesus Christ, and there established a residence for himself and all\r\nhis successors.(135) He also built a monastery not far from the city to\r\nthe eastward, in which, by his advice, Ethelbert erected from the\r\nfoundation the church of the blessed Apostles, Peter and Paul,(136) and\r\nenriched it with divers gifts; wherein the bodies of the same Augustine,\r\nand of all the bishops of Canterbury, and of the kings of Kent, might be\r\nburied. Nevertheless, it was not Augustine himself who consecrated that\r\nchurch, but Laurentius, his successor.\r\n\r\nThe first abbot of that monastery was the priest Peter,(137) who, being\r\nsent on a mission into Gaul, was drowned in a bay of the sea, which is\r\ncalled Amfleat,(138) and committed to a humble tomb by the inhabitants of\r\nthe place; but since it was the will of Almighty God to reveal his merits,\r\na light from Heaven was seen over his grave every night; till the\r\nneighbouring people who saw it, perceiving that he had been a holy man\r\nthat was buried there, and inquiring who and whence he was, carried away\r\nthe body, and interred it in the church, in the city of Boulogne, with the\r\nhonour due to so great a person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXXIV. How Ethelfrid, king of the Northumbrians, having vanquished\r\nthe nations of the Scots, expelled them from the territories of the\r\nEnglish. [603 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time, the brave and ambitious king, Ethelfrid,(139) governed the\r\nkingdom of the Northumbrians, and ravaged the Britons more than all the\r\nchiefs of the English, insomuch that he might be compared to Saul of old,\r\nking of the Israelites, save only in this, that he was ignorant of Divine\r\nreligion. For he conquered more territories from the Britons than any\r\nother chieftain or king, either subduing the inhabitants and making them\r\ntributary, or driving them out and planting the English in their places.\r\nTo him might justly be applied the saying of the patriarch blessing his\r\nson in the person of Saul, “Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf; in the morning\r\nhe shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.”(140)\r\nHereupon, Aedan, king of the Scots that dwell in Britain,(141) being\r\nalarmed by his success, came against him with a great and mighty army, but\r\nwas defeated and fled with a few followers; for almost all his army was\r\ncut to pieces at a famous place, called Degsastan, that is, Degsa\r\nStone.(142) In which battle also Theodbald, brother to Ethelfrid, was\r\nkilled, with almost all the forces he commanded. This war Ethelfrid\r\nbrought to an end in the year of our Lord 603, the eleventh of his own\r\nreign, which lasted twenty-four years, and the first year of the reign of\r\nPhocas, who then was at the head of the Roman empire. From that time, no\r\nking of the Scots durst come into Britain to make war on the English to\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. I. Of the death of the blessed Pope Gregory.(143) [604 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time, that is, in the year of our Lord 605,(144) the blessed Pope\r\nGregory, after having most gloriously governed the Roman Apostolic see\r\nthirteen years, six months, and ten days, died, and was translated to an\r\neternal abode in the kingdom of Heaven. Of whom, seeing that by his zeal\r\nhe converted our nation, the English, from the power of Satan to the faith\r\nof Christ, it behoves us to discourse more at large in our Ecclesiastical\r\nHistory, for we may rightly, nay, we must, call him our apostle; because,\r\nas soon as he began to wield the pontifical power over all the world, and\r\nwas placed over the Churches long before converted to the true faith, he\r\nmade our nation, till then enslaved to idols, the Church of Christ, so\r\nthat concerning him we may use those words of the Apostle; “if he be not\r\nan apostle to others, yet doubtless he is to us; for the seal of his\r\napostleship are we in the Lord.”(145)\r\n\r\nHe was by nation a Roman, son of Gordianus, tracing his descent from\r\nancestors that were not only noble, but religious. Moreover Felix, once\r\nbishop of the same Apostolic see, a man of great honour in Christ and in\r\nthe Church, was his forefather.(146) Nor did he show his nobility in\r\nreligion by less strength of devotion than his parents and kindred. But\r\nthat nobility of this world which was seen in him, by the help of the\r\nDivine Grace, he used only to gain the glory of eternal dignity; for soon\r\nquitting his secular habit, he entered a monastery, wherein he began to\r\nlive with so much grace of perfection that (as he was wont afterwards with\r\ntears to testify) his mind was above all transitory things; that he rose\r\nsuperior to all that is subject to change; that he used to think of\r\nnothing but what was heavenly; that, whilst detained by the body, he broke\r\nthrough the bonds of the flesh by contemplation; and that he even loved\r\ndeath, which is a penalty to almost all men, as the entrance into life,\r\nand the reward of his labours. This he used to say of himself, not to\r\nboast of his progress in virtue, but rather to bewail the falling off\r\nwhich he imagined he had sustained through his pastoral charge. Indeed,\r\nonce in a private conversation with his deacon, Peter, after having\r\nenumerated the former virtues of his soul, he added sorrowfully, “But now,\r\non account of the pastoral charge, it is entangled with the affairs of\r\nlaymen, and, after so fair an appearance of inward peace, is defiled with\r\nthe dust of earthly action. And having wasted itself on outward things, by\r\nturning aside to the affairs of many men, even when it desires the inward\r\nthings, it returns to them undoubtedly impaired. I therefore consider what\r\nI endure, I consider what I have lost, and when I behold what I have\r\nthrown away, that which I bear appears the more grievous.”\r\n\r\nSo spake the holy man constrained by his great humility. But it behoves us\r\nto believe that he lost nothing of his monastic perfection by reason of\r\nhis pastoral charge, but rather that he gained greater profit through the\r\nlabour of converting many, than by the former calm of his private life,\r\nand chiefly because, whilst holding the pontifical office, he set about\r\norganizing his house like a monastery. And when first drawn from the\r\nmonastery, ordained to the ministry of the altar, and sent to\r\nConstantinople as representative(147) of the Apostolic see, though he now\r\ntook part in the secular affairs of the palace, yet he did not abandon the\r\nfixed course of his heavenly life; for some of the brethren of his\r\nmonastery, who had followed him to the royal city in their brotherly love,\r\nhe employed for the better observance of monastic rule, to the end that at\r\nall times, by their example, as he writes himself, he might be held fast\r\nto the calm shore of prayer, as it were, with the cable of an anchor,\r\nwhilst he should be tossed up and down by the ceaseless waves of worldly\r\naffairs; and daily in the intercourse of studious reading with them,\r\nstrengthen his mind shaken with temporal concerns. By their company he was\r\nnot only guarded against the assaults of the world, but more and more\r\nroused to the exercises of a heavenly life.\r\n\r\nFor they persuaded him to interpret by a mystical exposition the book of\r\nthe blessed Job,(148) which is involved in great obscurity; nor could he\r\nrefuse to undertake that work, which brotherly affection imposed on him\r\nfor the future benefit of many; but in a wonderful manner, in five and\r\nthirty books of exposition, he taught how that same book is to be\r\nunderstood literally; how to be referred to the mysteries of Christ and\r\nthe Church; and in what sense it is to be adapted to every one of the\r\nfaithful. This work he began as papal representative in the royal city,\r\nbut finished it at Rome after being made pope. Whilst he was still in the\r\nroyal city, by the help of the grace of Catholic truth, he crushed in its\r\nfirst rise a new heresy which sprang up there, concerning the state of our\r\nresurrection. For Eutychius,(149) bishop of that city, taught, that our\r\nbody, in the glory of resurrection, would be impalpable, and more subtile\r\nthan wind and air. The blessed Gregory hearing this, proved by force of\r\ntruth, and by the instance of the Resurrection of our Lord, that this\r\ndoctrine was every way opposed to the orthodox faith. For the Catholic\r\nfaith holds that our body, raised by the glory of immortality, is indeed\r\nrendered subtile by the effect of spiritual power, but is palpable by the\r\nreality of nature; according to the example of our Lord’s Body, concerning\r\nwhich, when risen from the dead, He Himself says to His disciples, “Handle\r\nMe and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see Me\r\nhave.”(150) In maintaining this faith, the venerable Father Gregory so\r\nearnestly strove against the rising heresy, and with the help of the most\r\npious emperor, Tiberius Constantine,(151) so fully suppressed it, that\r\nnone has been since found to revive it.\r\n\r\nHe likewise composed another notable book, the “Liber Pastoralis,” wherein\r\nhe clearly showed what sort of persons ought to be preferred to rule the\r\nChurch; how such rulers ought to live; with how much discrimination they\r\nought to instruct the different classes of their hearers, and how\r\nseriously to reflect every day on their own frailty. He also wrote forty\r\nhomilies on the Gospel, which he divided equally into two volumes; and\r\ncomposed four books of Dialogues, in which, at the request of his deacon,\r\nPeter, he recounted the virtues of the more renowned saints of Italy, whom\r\nhe had either known or heard of, as a pattern of life for posterity; to\r\nthe end that, as he taught in his books of Expositions what virtues men\r\nought to strive after, so by describing the miracles of saints, he might\r\nmake known the glory of those virtues. Further, in twenty-two homilies, he\r\nshowed how much light is latent in the first and last parts of the prophet\r\nEzekiel, which seemed the most obscure. Besides which, he wrote the “Book\r\nof Answers,”(152) to the questions of the holy Augustine, the first bishop\r\nof the English nation, as we have shown above, inserting the same book\r\nentire in this history; and the useful little “Synodical Book,”(153) which\r\nhe composed with the bishops of Italy on necessary matters of the Church;\r\nas well as private letters to certain persons. And it is the more\r\nwonderful that he could write so many lengthy works, seeing that almost\r\nall the time of his youth, to use his own words, he was frequently\r\ntormented with internal pain, constantly enfeebled by the weakness of his\r\ndigestion, and oppressed by a low but persistent fever. But in all these\r\ntroubles, forasmuch as he carefully reflected that, as the Scripture\r\ntestifies,(154) “He scourgeth every son whom He receiveth,” the more\r\nseverely he suffered under those present evils, the more he assured\r\nhimself of his eternal hope.\r\n\r\nThus much may be said of his immortal genius, which could not be crushed\r\nby such severe bodily pains. Other popes applied themselves to building\r\nchurches or adorning them with gold and silver, but Gregory was wholly\r\nintent upon gaining souls. Whatsoever money he had, he took care to\r\ndistribute diligently and give to the poor, that his righteousness might\r\nendure for ever, and his horn be exalted with honour; so that the words of\r\nthe blessed Job might be truly said of him,(155) “When the ear heard me,\r\nthen it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:\r\nbecause I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that\r\nhad none to help him. The blessing of him that was ready to perish came\r\nupon me, and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy. I put on\r\nrighteousness, and it clothed me; my judgement was as a robe and a diadem.\r\nI was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. I was a father to the\r\npoor; and the cause which I knew not, I searched out. And I brake the jaws\r\nof the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.” And a little\r\nafter: “If I have withheld,” says he, “the poor from their desire; or have\r\ncaused the eyes of the widow to fail; or have eaten my morsel myself\r\nalone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof: (for from my youth\r\ncompassion grew up with me, and from my mother’s womb it came forth with\r\nme.”(156))\r\n\r\nTo his works of piety and righteousness this also may be added, that he\r\nsaved our nation, by the preachers he sent hither, from the teeth of the\r\nold enemy, and made it partaker of eternal liberty. Rejoicing in the faith\r\nand salvation of our race, and worthily commending it with praise, he\r\nsays, in his exposition of the blessed Job, “Behold, the tongue of\r\nBritain, which only knew how to utter barbarous cries, has long since\r\nbegun to raise the Hebrew Hallelujah to the praise of God! Behold, the\r\nonce swelling ocean now serves prostrate at the feet of the saints; and\r\nits wild upheavals, which earthly princes could not subdue with the sword,\r\nare now, through the fear of God, bound by the lips of priests with words\r\nalone; and the heathen that stood not in awe of troops of warriors, now\r\nbelieves and fears the tongues of the humble! For he has received a\r\nmessage from on high and mighty works are revealed; the strength of the\r\nknowledge of God is given him, and restrained by the fear of the Lord, he\r\ndreads to do evil, and with all his heart desires to attain to everlasting\r\ngrace.” In which words the blessed Gregory shows us this also, that St.\r\nAugustine and his companions brought the English to receive the truth, not\r\nonly by the preaching of words, but also by showing forth heavenly signs.\r\n\r\nThe blessed Pope Gregory, among other things, caused Masses to be\r\ncelebrated in the churches of the holy Apostles, Peter and Paul, over\r\ntheir bodies. And in the celebration of Masses, he added three petitions\r\nof the utmost perfection: “And dispose our days in thy peace, and bid us\r\nto be preserved from eternal damnation, and to be numbered in the flock of\r\nthine elect.”(157)\r\n\r\nHe governed the Church in the days of the Emperors Mauritius and Phocas,\r\nand passing out of this life in the second year of the same Phocas,(158)\r\nhe departed to the true life which is in Heaven. His body was buried in\r\nthe church of the blessed Apostle Peter before the sacristy, on the 12th\r\nday of March, to rise one day in the same body in glory with the rest of\r\nthe holy pastors of the Church. On his tomb was written this epitaph:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Receive, O Earth, his body taken from thine own; thou canst\r\n    restore it, when God calls to life. His spirit rises to the stars;\r\n    the claims of death shall not avail against him, for death itself\r\n    is but the way to new life. In this tomb are laid the limbs of a\r\n    great pontiff, who yet lives for ever in all places in countless\r\n    deeds of mercy. Hunger and cold he overcame with food and raiment,\r\n    and shielded souls from the enemy by his holy teaching. And\r\n    whatsoever he taught in word, that he fulfilled in deed, that he\r\n    might be a pattern, even as he spake words of mystic meaning. By\r\n    his guiding love he brought the Angles to Christ, gaining armies\r\n    for the Faith from a new people. This was thy toil, thy task, thy\r\n    care, thy aim as shepherd, to offer to thy Lord abundant increase\r\n    of the flock. So, Consul of God, rejoice in this thy triumph, for\r\n    now thou hast the reward of thy works for evermore.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor must we pass by in silence the story of the blessed Gregory, handed\r\ndown to us by the tradition of our ancestors, which explains his earnest\r\ncare for the salvation of our nation. It is said that one day, when some\r\nmerchants had lately arrived at Rome, many things were exposed for sale in\r\nthe market place, and much people resorted thither to buy: Gregory himself\r\nwent with the rest, and saw among other wares some boys put up for sale,\r\nof fair complexion, with pleasing countenances, and very beautiful hair.\r\nWhen he beheld them, he asked, it is said, from what region or country\r\nthey were brought? and was told, from the island of Britain, and that the\r\ninhabitants were like that in appearance. He again inquired whether those\r\nislanders were Christians, or still involved in the errors of paganism,\r\nand was informed that they were pagans. Then fetching a deep sigh from the\r\nbottom of his heart, “Alas! what pity,” said he, “that the author of\r\ndarkness should own men of such fair countenances; and that with such\r\ngrace of outward form, their minds should be void of inward grace.” He\r\ntherefore again asked, what was the name of that nation? and was answered,\r\nthat they were called Angles. “Right,” said he, “for they have an angelic\r\nface, and it is meet that such should be co-heirs with the Angels in\r\nheaven. What is the name of the province from which they are brought?” It\r\nwas replied, that the natives of that province were called Deiri.(159)\r\n“Truly are they _De ira_,” said he, “saved from wrath, and called to the\r\nmercy of Christ. How is the king of that province called?” They told him\r\nhis name was Aelli;(160) and he, playing upon the name, said, “Allelujah,\r\nthe praise of God the Creator must be sung in those parts.”\r\n\r\nThen he went to the bishop of the Roman Apostolic see(161) (for he was not\r\nhimself then made pope), and entreated him to send some ministers of the\r\nWord into Britain to the nation of the English, that it might be converted\r\nto Christ by them; declaring himself ready to carry out that work with the\r\nhelp of God, if the Apostolic Pope should think fit to have it done. But\r\nnot being then able to perform this task, because, though the Pope was\r\nwilling to grant his request, yet the citizens of Rome could not be\r\nbrought to consent that he should depart so far from the city, as soon as\r\nhe was himself made Pope, he carried out the long-desired work, sending,\r\nindeed, other preachers, but himself by his exhortations and prayers\r\nhelping the preaching to bear fruit. This account, which we have received\r\nfrom a past generation, we have thought fit to insert in our\r\nEcclesiastical History.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. II. How Augustine admonished the bishops of the Britons on behalf of\r\nCatholic peace, and to that end wrought a heavenly miracle in their\r\npresence; and of the vengeance that pursued them for their contempt.\r\n[_Circ._ 603 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Augustine, with the help of King Ethelbert, drew together\r\nto a conference the bishops and doctors of the nearest province of the\r\nBritons, at a place which is to this day called, in the English language,\r\nAugustine’s Ác, that is, Augustine’s Oak,(162) on the borders of the\r\nHwiccas(163) and West Saxons; and began by brotherly admonitions to\r\npersuade them to preserve Catholic peace with him, and undertake the\r\ncommon labour of preaching the Gospel to the heathen for the Lord’s sake.\r\nFor they did not keep Easter Sunday at the proper time, but from the\r\nfourteenth to the twentieth moon; which computation is contained in a\r\ncycle of eighty-four years.(164) Besides, they did many other things which\r\nwere opposed to the unity of the church.(165) When, after a long\r\ndisputation, they did not comply with the entreaties, exhortations, or\r\nrebukes of Augustine and his companions, but preferred their own\r\ntraditions before all the Churches which are united in Christ throughout\r\nthe world, the holy father, Augustine, put an end to this troublesome and\r\ntedious contention, saying, “Let us entreat God, who maketh men to be of\r\none mind in His Father’s house, to vouchsafe, by signs from Heaven, to\r\ndeclare to us which tradition is to be followed; and by what path we are\r\nto strive to enter His kingdom. Let some sick man be brought, and let the\r\nfaith and practice of him, by whose prayers he shall be healed, be looked\r\nupon as hallowed in God’s sight and such as should be adopted by all.” His\r\nadversaries unwillingly consenting, a blind man of the English race was\r\nbrought, who having been presented to the British bishops, found no\r\nbenefit or healing from their ministry; at length, Augustine, compelled by\r\nstrict necessity, bowed his knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,\r\npraying that He would restore his lost sight to the blind man, and by the\r\nbodily enlightenment of one kindle the grace of spiritual light in the\r\nhearts of many of the faithful. Immediately the blind man received sight,\r\nand Augustine was proclaimed by all to be a true herald of the light from\r\nHeaven. The Britons then confessed that they perceived that it was the\r\ntrue way of righteousness which Augustine taught; but that they could not\r\ndepart from their ancient customs without the consent and sanction of\r\ntheir people. They therefore desired that a second time a synod might be\r\nappointed, at which more of their number should be present.\r\n\r\nThis being decreed, there came, it is said, seven bishops of the\r\nBritons,(166) and many men of great learning, particularly from their most\r\ncelebrated monastery, which is called, in the English tongue,\r\nBancornaburg,(167) and over which the Abbot Dinoot(168) is said to have\r\npresided at that time. They that were to go to the aforesaid council,\r\nbetook themselves first to a certain holy and discreet man, who was wont\r\nto lead the life of a hermit among them, to consult with him, whether they\r\nought, at the preaching of Augustine, to forsake their traditions. He\r\nanswered, “If he is a man of God, follow him.”—“How shall we know that?”\r\nsaid they. He replied, “Our Lord saith, Take My yoke upon you, and learn\r\nof Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart; if therefore, Augustine is meek\r\nand lowly of heart, it is to be believed that he bears the yoke of Christ\r\nhimself, and offers it to you to bear. But, if he is harsh and proud, it\r\nis plain that he is not of God, nor are we to regard his words.” They said\r\nagain, “And how shall we discern even this?”—“Do you contrive,” said the\r\nanchorite, “that he first arrive with his company at the place where the\r\nsynod is to be held; and if at your approach he rises up to you, hear him\r\nsubmissively, being assured that he is the servant of Christ; but if he\r\ndespises you, and does not rise up to you, whereas you are more in number,\r\nlet him also be despised by you.”\r\n\r\nThey did as he directed; and it happened, that as they approached,\r\nAugustine was sitting on a chair. When they perceived it, they were angry,\r\nand charging him with pride, set themselves to contradict all he said. He\r\nsaid to them, “Many things ye do which are contrary to our custom, or\r\nrather the custom of the universal Church, and yet, if you will comply\r\nwith me in these three matters, to wit, to keep Easter at the due time; to\r\nfulfil the ministry of Baptism, by which we are born again to God,\r\naccording to the custom of the holy Roman Apostolic Church;(169) and to\r\njoin with us in preaching the Word of God to the English nation, we will\r\ngladly suffer all the other things you do, though contrary to our\r\ncustoms.” They answered that they would do none of those things, nor\r\nreceive him as their archbishop; for they said among themselves, “if he\r\nwould not rise up to us now, how much more will he despise us, as of no\r\naccount, if we begin to be under his subjection?” Then the man of God,\r\nAugustine, is said to have threatened them, that if they would not accept\r\npeace with their brethren, they should have war from their enemies; and,\r\nif they would not preach the way of life to the English nation, they\r\nshould suffer at their hands the vengeance of death. All which, through\r\nthe dispensation of the Divine judgement, fell out exactly as he had\r\npredicted.\r\n\r\nFor afterwards the warlike king of the English, Ethelfrid,(170) of whom we\r\nhave spoken, having raised a mighty army, made a very great slaughter of\r\nthat heretical nation, at the city of Legions,(171) which by the English\r\nis called Legacaestir, but by the Britons more rightly Carlegion. Being\r\nabout to give battle, he observed their priests, who were come together to\r\noffer up their prayers to God for the combatants, standing apart in a\r\nplace of greater safety; he inquired who they were, and what they came\r\ntogether to do in that place. Most of them were of the monastery of\r\nBangor,(172) in which, it is said, there was so great a number of monks,\r\nthat the monastery being divided into seven parts, with a superior set\r\nover each, none of those parts contained less than three hundred men, who\r\nall lived by the labour of their hands. Many of these, having observed a\r\nfast of three days, had come together along with others to pray at the\r\naforesaid battle, having one Brocmail(173) for their protector, to defend\r\nthem, whilst they were intent upon their prayers, against the swords of\r\nthe barbarians. King Ethelfrid being informed of the occasion of their\r\ncoming, said, “If then they cry to their God against us, in truth, though\r\nthey do not bear arms, yet they fight against us, because they assail us\r\nwith their curses.” He, therefore, commanded them to be attacked first,\r\nand then destroyed the rest of the impious army, not without great loss of\r\nhis own forces. About twelve hundred of those that came to pray are said\r\nto have been killed, and only fifty to have escaped by flight. Brocmail,\r\nturning his back with his men, at the first approach of the enemy, left\r\nthose whom he ought to have defended unarmed and exposed to the swords of\r\nthe assailants. Thus was fulfilled the prophecy of the holy Bishop\r\nAugustine, though he himself had been long before taken up into the\r\nheavenly kingdom, that the heretics should feel the vengeance of temporal\r\ndeath also, because they had despised the offer of eternal salvation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. III. How St. Augustine made Mellitus and Justus bishops; and of his\r\ndeath. [604 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 604, Augustine, Archbishop of Britain, ordained\r\ntwo bishops, to wit, Mellitus and Justus;(174) Mellitus to preach to the\r\nprovince of the East-Saxons, who are divided from Kent by the river\r\nThames, and border on the Eastern sea. Their metropolis is the city of\r\nLondon, which is situated on the bank of the aforesaid river, and is the\r\nmart of many nations resorting to it by sea and land. At that time,\r\nSabert, nephew to Ethelbert through his sister Ricula, reigned over the\r\nnation, though he was under subjection to Ethelbert, who, as has been said\r\nabove, had command over all the nations of the English as far as the river\r\nHumber. But when this province also received the word of truth, by the\r\npreaching of Mellitus, King Ethelbert built the church of St. Paul the\r\nApostle,(175) in the city of London, where he and his successors should\r\nhave their episcopal see. As for Justus, Augustine ordained him bishop in\r\nKent, at the city of Dorubrevis, which the English call\r\nHrofaescaestrae,(176) from one that was formerly the chief man of it,\r\ncalled Hrof. It is about twenty-four miles distant from the city of\r\nCanterbury to the westward, and in it King Ethelbert dedicated a church to\r\nthe blessed Apostle Andrew,(177) and bestowed many gifts on the bishops of\r\nboth those churches, as well as on the Bishop of Canterbury, adding lands\r\nand possessions for the use of those who were associated with the bishops.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the beloved of God, our father Augustine, died,(178) and his\r\nbody was laid outside, close by the church of the blessed Apostles, Peter\r\nand Paul, above spoken of, because it was not yet finished, nor\r\nconsecrated, but as soon as it was consecrated,(179) the body was brought\r\nin, and fittingly buried in the north chapel(180) thereof; wherein also\r\nwere interred the bodies of all the succeeding archbishops, except two\r\nonly, Theodore and Bertwald, whose bodies are in the church itself,\r\nbecause the aforesaid chapel could contain no more.(181) Almost in the\r\nmidst of this chapel is an altar dedicated in honour of the blessed Pope\r\nGregory, at which every Saturday memorial Masses are celebrated for the\r\narchbishops by a priest of that place. On the tomb of Augustine is\r\ninscribed this epitaph:\r\n\r\n“Here rests the Lord Augustine, first Archbishop of Canterbury, who, being\r\nof old sent hither by the blessed Gregory, Bishop of the city of Rome, and\r\nsupported by God in the working of miracles, led King Ethelbert and his\r\nnation from the worship of idols to the faith of Christ, and having ended\r\nthe days of his office in peace, died the 26th day of May, in the reign of\r\nthe same king.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. IV. How Laurentius and his bishops admonished the Scots to observe\r\nthe unity of the Holy Church, particularly in keeping of Easter; and how\r\nMellitus went to Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nLaurentius(182) succeeded Augustine in the bishopric, having been ordained\r\nthereto by the latter, in his lifetime, lest, upon his death, the Church,\r\nas yet in so unsettled a state, might begin to falter, if it should be\r\ndestitute of a pastor, though but for one hour. Wherein he also followed\r\nthe example of the first pastor of the Church, that is, of the most\r\nblessed Peter, chief of the Apostles, who, having founded the Church of\r\nChrist at Rome, is said to have consecrated Clement to help him in\r\npreaching the Gospel, and at the same time to be his successor.\r\nLaurentius, being advanced to the rank of archbishop, laboured\r\nindefatigably, both by frequent words of holy exhortation and constant\r\nexample of good works to strengthen the foundations of the Church, which\r\nhad been so nobly laid, and to carry it on to the fitting height of\r\nperfection. In short, he not only took charge of the new Church formed\r\namong the English, but endeavoured also to bestow his pastoral care upon\r\nthe tribes of the ancient inhabitants of Britain, as also of the Scots,\r\nwho inhabit the island of Ireland,(183) which is next to Britain. For when\r\nhe understood that the life and profession of the Scots in their aforesaid\r\ncountry, as well as of the Britons in Britain, was not truly in accordance\r\nwith the practice of the Church in many matters, especially that they did\r\nnot celebrate the festival of Easter at the due time, but thought that the\r\nday of the Resurrection of our Lord ought, as has been said above, to be\r\nobserved between the 14th and 20th of the moon; he wrote, jointly with his\r\nfellow bishops, a hortatory epistle, entreating and conjuring them to keep\r\nthe unity of peace and Catholic observance with the Church of Christ\r\nspread throughout the world. The beginning of which epistle is as follows:\r\n\r\n“_To our most dear brethren, the Lords Bishops and Abbots throughout all\r\nthe country of the Scots,_(_184_)_ Laurentius, Mellitus, and Justus,\r\nBishops, servants of the servants of God._ When the Apostolic see,\r\naccording to the universal custom which it has followed elsewhere, sent us\r\nto these western parts to preach to pagan nations, and it was our lot to\r\ncome into this island, which is called Britain, before we knew them, we\r\nheld both the Britons and Scots in great esteem for sanctity, believing\r\nthat they walked according to the custom of the universal Church; but\r\nbecoming acquainted with the Britons, we thought that the Scots had been\r\nbetter. Now we have learnt from Bishop Dagan,(185) who came into this\r\naforesaid island, and the Abbot Columban,(186) in Gaul, that the Scots in\r\nno way differ from the Britons in their walk; for when Bishop Dagan came\r\nto us, not only did he refuse to eat at the same table, but even to eat in\r\nthe same house where we were entertained.”\r\n\r\nAlso Laurentius with his fellow bishops wrote a letter to the bishops of\r\nthe Britons, suitable to his degree, by which he endeavoured to confirm\r\nthem in Catholic unity; but what he gained by so doing the present times\r\nstill show.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, Mellitus, bishop of London, went to Rome, to confer with\r\nthe Apostolic Pope Boniface about the necessary affairs of the English\r\nChurch. And the same most reverend pope, assembling a synod of the bishops\r\nof Italy,(187) to prescribe rules for the life and peace of the monks,\r\nMellitus also sat among them, in the eighth year of the reign of the\r\nEmperor Phocas, the thirteenth indiction, on the 27th of February,(188) to\r\nthe end that he also might sign and confirm by his authority whatsoever\r\nshould be regularly decreed, and on his return into Britain might carry\r\nthe decrees to the Churches of the English, to be committed to them and\r\nobserved; together with letters which the same pope sent to the beloved of\r\nGod, Archbishop Laurentius, and to all the clergy; as likewise to King\r\nEthelbert and the English nation. This pope was Boniface, the fourth after\r\nthe blessed Gregory, bishop of the city of Rome. He obtained for the\r\nChurch of Christ from the Emperor Phocas the gift of the temple at Rome\r\ncalled by the ancients Pantheon, as representing all the gods; wherein he,\r\nhaving purified it from all defilement, dedicated a church to the holy\r\nMother of God, and to all Christ’s martyrs, to the end that, the company\r\nof devils being expelled, the blessed company of the saints might have\r\ntherein a perpetual memorial.(189)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. V. How, after the death of the kings Ethelbert and Sabert, their\r\nsuccessors restored idolatry; for which reason, both Mellitus and Justus\r\ndeparted out of Britain. [616 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 616, which is the twenty-first year after\r\nAugustine and his company were sent to preach to the English nation,\r\nEthelbert, king of Kent, having most gloriously governed his temporal\r\nkingdom fifty-six years, entered into the eternal joys of the kingdom of\r\nHeaven. He was the third of the English kings who ruled over all the\r\nsouthern provinces that are divided from the northern by the river Humber\r\nand the borders contiguous to it;(190) but the first of all that ascended\r\nto the heavenly kingdom. The first who had the like sovereignty was Aelli,\r\nking of the South-Saxons; the second, Caelin, king of the West-Saxons,\r\nwho, in their own language, is called Ceaulin; the third, as has been\r\nsaid, was Ethelbert, king of Kent; the fourth was Redwald, king of the\r\nEast-Angles, who, even in the life-time of Ethelbert, had been acquiring\r\nthe leadership for his own race. The fifth was Edwin, king of the\r\nNorthumbrian nation, that is, of those who live in the district to the\r\nnorth of the river Humber; his power was greater; he had the overlordship\r\nover all the nations who inhabit Britain, both English and British, except\r\nonly the people of Kent; and he reduced also under the dominion of the\r\nEnglish, the Mevanian Islands(191) of the Britons, lying between Ireland\r\nand Britain; the sixth was Oswald, the most Christian king of the\r\nNorthumbrians, whose kingdom was within the same bounds; the seventh, his\r\nbrother Oswy, ruled over a kingdom of like extent for a time, and for the\r\nmost part subdued and made tributary the nations of the Picts and Scots,\r\nwho occupy the northern parts of Britain: but of that hereafter.\r\n\r\nKing Ethelbert died on the 24th day of the month of February, twenty-one\r\nyears after he had received the faith,(192) and was buried in St. Martin’s\r\nchapel within the church of the blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, where\r\nalso lies his queen, Bertha. Among other benefits which he conferred upon\r\nhis nation in his care for them, he established, with the help of his\r\ncouncil of wise men,(193) judicial decisions, after the Roman model; which\r\nare written in the language of the English, and are still kept and\r\nobserved by them. Among which, he set down first what satisfaction should\r\nbe given by any one who should steal anything belonging to the Church, the\r\nbishop, or the other clergy, for he was resolved to give protection to\r\nthose whom he had received along with their doctrine.\r\n\r\nThis Ethelbert was the son of Irminric, whose father was Octa, whose\r\nfather was Oeric, surnamed Oisc, from whom the kings of Kent are wont to\r\nbe called Oiscings.(194) His father was Hengist, who, being invited by\r\nVortigern, first came into Britain, with his son Oisc, as has been said\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nBut after the death of Ethelbert, the accession of his son Eadbald proved\r\nvery harmful to the still tender growth of the new Church; for he not only\r\nrefused to accept the faith of Christ, but was also defiled with such\r\nfornication, as the Apostle testifies, as is not so much as named among\r\nthe Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife.(195) By both which\r\ncrimes he gave occasion to those to return to their former uncleanness,\r\nwho, under his father, had, either for favour or fear of the king,\r\nsubmitted to the laws of the faith and of a pure life. Nor did the\r\nunbelieving king escape without the scourge of Divine severity in\r\nchastisement and correction; for he was troubled with frequent fits of\r\nmadness, and possessed by an unclean spirit. The storm of this disturbance\r\nwas increased by the death of Sabert, king of the East Saxons, who\r\ndeparting to the heavenly kingdom, left three sons, still pagans, to\r\ninherit his temporal crown. They immediately began openly to give\r\nthemselves up to idolatry, which, during their father’s lifetime, they had\r\nseemed somewhat to abandon, and they granted free licence to their\r\nsubjects to serve idols. And when they saw the bishop, whilst celebrating\r\nMass in the church, give the Eucharist to the people, filled, as they\r\nwere, with folly and ignorance, they said to him, as is commonly reported,\r\n“Why do you not give us also that white bread, which you used to give to\r\nour father Saba (for so they were wont to call him), and which you still\r\ncontinue to give to the people in the church?” To whom he answered, “If\r\nyou will be washed in that font of salvation, in which your father was\r\nwashed, you may also partake of the holy Bread of which he partook; but if\r\nyou despise the laver of life, you can in no wise receive the Bread of\r\nlife.” They replied, “We will not enter into that font, because we know\r\nthat we do not stand in need of it, and yet we will be refreshed by that\r\nbread.” And being often earnestly admonished by him, that this could by no\r\nmeans be done, nor would any one be admitted to partake of the sacred\r\nOblation without the holy cleansing, at last, they said, filled with rage,\r\n“If you will not comply with us in so small a matter as that which we\r\nrequire, you shall not stay in our province.” And they drove him out and\r\nbade him and his company depart from their kingdom. Being driven thence,\r\nhe came into Kent, to take counsel with his fellow bishops, Laurentius and\r\nJustus, and learn what was to be done in that case; and with one consent\r\nthey determined that it was better for them all to return to their own\r\ncountry, where they might serve God in freedom of mind, than to continue\r\nto no purpose among barbarians, who had revolted from the faith. Mellitus\r\nand Justus accordingly went away first, and withdrew into the parts of\r\nGaul, intending there to await the event. But the kings, who had driven\r\nfrom them the herald of the truth, did not continue long unpunished in\r\ntheir worship of devils. For marching out to battle against the nation of\r\nthe Gewissi,(196) they were all slain with their army. Nevertheless, the\r\npeople, having been once turned to wickedness, though the authors of it\r\nwere destroyed, would not be corrected, nor return to the unity of faith\r\nand charity which is in Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. VI. How Laurentius, being reproved by the Apostle Peter, converted\r\nKing Eadbald to Christ; and how the king soon recalled Mellitus and Justus\r\nto preach the Word. [617-618 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLaurentius, being about to follow Mellitus and Justus, and to quit\r\nBritain, ordered his bed to be laid that night in the church of the\r\nblessed Apostles, Peter and Paul, which has been often mentioned before;\r\nwherein having laid himself to rest, after he had with tears poured forth\r\nmany prayers to God for the state of the Church, he fell asleep; in the\r\ndead of night, the blessed chief of the Apostles appeared to him, and\r\nscourging him grievously a long time, asked of him with apostolic\r\nseverity, why he was forsaking the flock which he had committed to him? or\r\nto what shepherd he was leaving, by his flight, Christ’s sheep that were\r\nin the midst of wolves? “Hast thou,” he said, “forgotten my example, who,\r\nfor the sake of those little ones, whom Christ commended to me in token of\r\nHis affection, underwent at the hands of infidels and enemies of Christ,\r\nbonds, stripes, imprisonment, afflictions, and lastly, death itself, even\r\nthe death of the cross, that I might at last be crowned with Him?”\r\nLaurentius, the servant of Christ, roused by the scourging of the blessed\r\nPeter and his words of exhortation, went to the king as soon as morning\r\nbroke, and laying aside his garment, showed the scars of the stripes which\r\nhe had received. The king, astonished, asked who had presumed to inflict\r\nsuch stripes on so great a man. And when he heard that for the sake of his\r\nsalvation the bishop had suffered these cruel blows at the hands of the\r\nApostle of Christ, he was greatly afraid; and abjuring the worship of\r\nidols, and renouncing his unlawful marriage, he received the faith of\r\nChrist, and being baptized, promoted and supported the interests of the\r\nChurch to the utmost of his power.\r\n\r\nHe also sent over into Gaul, and recalled Mellitus and Justus, and bade\r\nthem return to govern their churches in freedom. They came back one year\r\nafter their departure, and Justus returned to the city of Rochester, where\r\nhe had before presided; but the people of London would not receive Bishop\r\nMellitus, choosing rather to be under their idolatrous high priests; for\r\nKing Eadbald had not so much authority in the kingdom as his father, and\r\nwas not able to restore the bishop to his church against the will and\r\nconsent of the pagans. But he and his nation, after his conversion to the\r\nLord, sought to obey the commandments of God. Lastly, he built the church\r\nof the holy Mother of God,(197) in the monastery of the most blessed chief\r\nof the Apostles, which was afterwards consecrated by Archbishop Mellitus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. VII. How Bishop Mellitus by prayer quenched a fire in his city. [619\r\nA.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this king’s reign, the blessed Archbishop Laurentius was taken up to\r\nthe heavenly kingdom: he was buried in the church and monastery of the\r\nholy Apostle Peter, close by his predecessor Augustine, on the 2nd day of\r\nthe month of February.(198) Mellitus, who was bishop of London, succeeded\r\nto the see of Canterbury, being the third archbishop from Augustine;\r\nJustus, who was still living, governed the church of Rochester. These\r\nruled the Church of the English with much care and industry, and received\r\nletters of exhortation from Boniface,(199) bishop of the Roman Apostolic\r\nsee, who presided over the Church after Deusdedit, in the year of our Lord\r\n619. Mellitus laboured under the bodily infirmity of gout, but his mind\r\nwas sound and active, cheerfully passing over all earthly things, and\r\nalways aspiring to love, seek, and attain to those which are celestial. He\r\nwas noble by birth, but still nobler by the elevation of his mind.\r\n\r\nIn short, that I may give one instance of his power, from which the rest\r\nmay be inferred, it happened once that the city of Canterbury, being set\r\non fire through carelessness, was in danger of being consumed by the\r\nspreading conflagration; water was thrown on the fire in vain; a\r\nconsiderable part of the city was already destroyed, and the fierce flames\r\nwere advancing towards the bishop’s abode, when he, trusting in God, where\r\nhuman help failed, ordered himself to be carried towards the raging masses\r\nof fire which were spreading on every side. The church of the four crowned\r\nMartyrs(200) was in the place where the fire raged most fiercely. The\r\nbishop, being carried thither by his servants, weak as he was, set about\r\naverting by prayer the danger which the strong hands of active men had not\r\nbeen able to overcome with all their exertions. Immediately the wind,\r\nwhich blowing from the south had spread the conflagration throughout the\r\ncity, veered to the north, and thus prevented the destruction of those\r\nplaces that had been exposed to its full violence, then it ceased entirely\r\nand there was a calm, while the flames likewise sank and were\r\nextinguished. And because the man of God burned with the fire of divine\r\nlove, and was wont to drive away the storms of the powers of the air, by\r\nhis frequent prayers and at his bidding, from doing harm to himself, or\r\nhis people, it was meet that he should be allowed to prevail over the\r\nwinds and flames of this world, and to obtain that they should not injure\r\nhim or his.\r\n\r\nThis archbishop also, having ruled the church five years, departed to\r\nheaven in the reign of King Eadbald, and was buried with his fathers in\r\nthe monastery and church, which we have so often mentioned, of the most\r\nblessed chief of the Apostles, in the year of our Lord 624, on the 24th\r\nday of April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. VIII. How Pope Boniface sent the Pall and a letter to Justus,\r\nsuccessor to Mellitus. [624 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJustus, bishop of the church of Rochester, immediately succeeded Mellitus\r\nin the archbishopric. He consecrated Romanus bishop of that see in his own\r\nstead, having obtained authority to ordain bishops from Pope Boniface,\r\nwhom we mentioned above as successor to Deusdedit: of which licence this\r\nis the form:\r\n\r\n“_Boniface, to his most beloved brother Justus._ We have learnt not only\r\nfrom the contents of your letter addressed to us, but from the fulfilment\r\ngranted to your work, how faithfully and vigilantly you have laboured, my\r\nbrother, for the Gospel of Christ; for Almighty God has not forsaken\r\neither the mystery of His Name, or the fruit of your labours, having\r\nHimself faithfully promised to the preachers of the Gospel, ‘Lo! I am with\r\nyou alway, even unto the end of the world’;(201) which promise His mercy\r\nhas particularly manifested in this ministry imposed upon you, opening the\r\nhearts of the nations to receive the wondrous mystery of your preaching.\r\nFor He has blessed with a rich reward your Eminence’s acceptable course,\r\nby the support of His loving kindness; granting a plentiful increase to\r\nyour labours in the faithful management of the talents committed to you,\r\nand bestowing it on that which you might confirm to many generations.(202)\r\nThis is conferred on you by that recompense whereby, constantly\r\npersevering in the ministry imposed upon you, you have awaited with\r\npraiseworthy patience the redemption of that nation, and that they might\r\nprofit by your merits, salvation has been bestowed on them. For our Lord\r\nHimself says, ‘He that endureth to the end shall be saved.’(203) You are,\r\ntherefore, saved by the hope of patience, and the virtue of endurance, to\r\nthe end that the hearts of unbelievers, being cleansed from their natural\r\ndisease of superstition, might obtain the mercy of their Saviour: for\r\nhaving received letters from our son Adulwald,(204) we perceive with how\r\nmuch knowledge of the Sacred Word you, my brother, have brought his mind\r\nto the belief in true conversion and the certainty of the faith.\r\nTherefore, firmly confiding in the long-suffering of the Divine clemency,\r\nwe believe that, through the ministry of your preaching, there will ensue\r\nmost full salvation not only of the nations subject to him, but also of\r\ntheir neighbours; to the end, that as it is written, the recompense of a\r\nperfect work may be conferred on you by the Lord, the Rewarder of all the\r\njust; and that the universal confession of all nations, having received\r\nthe mystery of the Christian faith, may declare, that in truth ‘Their\r\nsound is gone out into all the earth, and their words unto the end of the\r\nworld.’(205)\r\n\r\n“We have also, my brother, moved by the warmth of our goodwill, sent you\r\nby the bearer of these presents, the pall, giving you authority to use it\r\nonly in the celebration of the Sacred Mysteries; granting to you likewise\r\nto ordain bishops when there shall be occasion, through the Lord’s mercy;\r\nthat so the Gospel of Christ, by the preaching of many, may be spread\r\nabroad in all the nations that are not yet converted. You must, therefore,\r\nendeavour, my brother, to preserve with unblemished sincerity of mind that\r\nwhich you have received through the kindness of the Apostolic see, bearing\r\nin mind what it is that is represented by the honourable vestment which\r\nyou have obtained to be borne on your shoulders. And imploring the Divine\r\nmercy, study to show yourself such that you may present before the\r\ntribunal of the Supreme Judge that is to come, the rewards of the favour\r\ngranted to you, not with guiltiness, but with the benefit of souls.\r\n\r\n“God preserve you in safety, most dear brother!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. IX. Of the reign of King Edwin, and how Paulinus, coming to preach\r\nthe Gospel, first converted his daughter and others to the mysteries of\r\nthe faith of Christ. [625-626 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time the nation of the Northumbrians, that is, the English tribe\r\ndwelling on the north side of the river Humber, with their king,\r\nEdwin,(206) received the Word of faith through the preaching of\r\nPaulinus,(207) of whom we have before spoken. This king, as an earnest of\r\nhis reception of the faith, and his share in the heavenly kingdom,\r\nreceived an increase also of his temporal realm, for he reduced under his\r\ndominion all the parts of Britain(208) that were provinces either of the\r\nEnglish, or of the Britons, a thing which no English king had ever done\r\nbefore; and he even subjected to the English the Mevanian islands, as has\r\nbeen said above.(209) The more important of these, which is to the\r\nsouthward, is the larger in extent, and more fruitful, containing nine\r\nhundred and sixty families, according to the English computation; the\r\nother contains above three hundred.\r\n\r\nThe occasion of this nation’s reception of the faith was the alliance by\r\nmarriage of their aforesaid king with the kings of Kent, for he had taken\r\nto wife Ethelberg, otherwise called Tata,(210) daughter to King Ethelbert.\r\nWhen he first sent ambassadors to ask her in marriage of her brother\r\nEadbald, who then reigned in Kent, he received the answer, “That it was\r\nnot lawful to give a Christian maiden in marriage to a pagan husband, lest\r\nthe faith and the mysteries of the heavenly King should be profaned by her\r\nunion with a king that was altogether a stranger to the worship of the\r\ntrue God.” This answer being brought to Edwin by his messengers, he\r\npromised that he would in no manner act in opposition to the Christian\r\nfaith, which the maiden professed; but would give leave to her, and all\r\nthat went with her, men and women, bishops and clergy, to follow their\r\nfaith and worship after the custom of the Christians. Nor did he refuse to\r\naccept that religion himself, if, being examined by wise men, it should be\r\nfound more holy and more worthy of God.\r\n\r\nSo the maiden was promised, and sent to Edwin, and in accordance with the\r\nagreement, Paulinus, a man beloved of God, was ordained bishop, to go with\r\nher, and by daily exhortations, and celebrating the heavenly Mysteries, to\r\nconfirm her and her company, lest they should be corrupted by intercourse\r\nwith the pagans. Paulinus was ordained bishop by the Archbishop Justus, on\r\nthe 21st day of July, in the year of our Lord 625, and so came to King\r\nEdwin with the aforesaid maiden as an attendant on their union in the\r\nflesh. But his mind was wholly bent upon calling the nation to which he\r\nwas sent to the knowledge of truth; according to the words of the Apostle,\r\n“To espouse her to the one true Husband, that he might present her as a\r\nchaste virgin to Christ.”(211) Being come into that province, he laboured\r\nmuch, not only to retain those that went with him, by the help of God,\r\nthat they should not abandon the faith, but, if haply he might, to convert\r\nsome of the pagans to the grace of the faith by his preaching. But, as the\r\nApostle says, though he laboured long in the Word, “The god of this world\r\nblinded the minds of them that believed not, lest the light of the\r\nglorious Gospel of Christ should shine unto them.”(212)\r\n\r\nThe next year there came into the province one called Eumer, sent by the\r\nking of the West-Saxons, whose name was Cuichelm,(213) to lie in wait for\r\nKing Edwin, in hopes at once to deprive him of his kingdom and his life.\r\nHe had a two-edged dagger, dipped in poison, to the end that, if the wound\r\ninflicted by the weapon did not avail to kill the king, it might be aided\r\nby the deadly venom. He came to the king on the first day of the Easter\r\nfestival,(214) at the river Derwent, where there was then a royal\r\ntownship,(215) and being admitted as if to deliver a message from his\r\nmaster, whilst unfolding in cunning words his pretended embassy, he\r\nstarted up on a sudden, and unsheathing the dagger under his garment,\r\nassaulted the king. When Lilla, the king’s most devoted servant, saw this,\r\nhaving no buckler at hand to protect the king from death, he at once\r\ninterposed his own body to receive the blow; but the enemy struck home\r\nwith such force, that he wounded the king through the body of the\r\nslaughtered thegn. Being then attacked on all sides with swords, in the\r\nconfusion he also slew impiously with his dagger another of the thegns,\r\nwhose name was Forthhere.\r\n\r\nOn that same holy Easter night, the queen had brought forth to the king a\r\ndaughter, called Eanfled. The king, in the presence of Bishop Paulinus,\r\ngave thanks to his gods for the birth of his daughter; and the bishop, on\r\nhis part, began to give thanks to Christ, and to tell the king, that by\r\nhis prayers to Him he had obtained that the queen should bring forth the\r\nchild in safety, and without grievous pain. The king, delighted with his\r\nwords, promised, that if God would grant him life and victory over the\r\nking by whom the murderer who had wounded him had been sent, he would\r\nrenounce his idols, and serve Christ; and as a pledge that he would\r\nperform his promise, he delivered up that same daughter to Bishop\r\nPaulinus, to be consecrated to Christ. She was the first to be baptized of\r\nthe nation of the Northumbrians, and she received Baptism on the holy day\r\nof Pentecost, along with eleven others of her house.(216) At that time,\r\nthe king, being recovered of the wound which he had received, raised an\r\narmy and marched against the nation of the West-Saxons; and engaging in\r\nwar, either slew or received in surrender all those of whom he learned\r\nthat they had conspired to murder him. So he returned victorious into his\r\nown country, but he would not immediately and unadvisedly embrace the\r\nmysteries of the Christian faith, though he no longer worshipped idols,\r\never since he made the promise that he would serve Christ; but first took\r\nheed earnestly to be instructed at leisure by the venerable Paulinus, in\r\nthe knowledge of faith, and to confer with such as he knew to be the\r\nwisest of his chief men, inquiring what they thought was fittest to be\r\ndone in that case. And being a man of great natural sagacity, he often sat\r\nalone by himself a long time in silence, deliberating in the depths of his\r\nheart how he should proceed, and to which religion he should adhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. X. How Pope Boniface, by letter, exhorted the same king to embrace\r\nthe faith. [_Circ._ 625 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time he received a letter from Pope Boniface(217) exhorting him to\r\nembrace the faith, which was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    COPY OF THE LETTER OF THE MOST BLESSED AND APOSTOLIC POPE OF THE\r\n    CHURCH OF THE CITY OF ROME, BONIFACE, ADDRESSED TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS\r\n    EDWIN, KING OF THE ENGLISH.\r\n\r\n    “_To the illustrious Edwin, king of the English, Bishop Boniface,\r\n    the servant of the servants of God._ Although the power of the\r\n    Supreme Deity cannot be expressed by the function of human speech,\r\n    seeing that, by its own greatness, it so consists in invisible and\r\n    unsearchable eternity, that no keenness of wit can comprehend or\r\n    express how great it is; yet inasmuch as His Humanity, having\r\n    opened the doors of the heart to receive Himself, mercifully, by\r\n    secret inspiration, puts into the minds of men such things as It\r\n    reveals concerning Itself,(218) we have thought fit to extend our\r\n    episcopal care so far as to make known to you the fulness of the\r\n    Christian faith; to the end that, bringing to your knowledge the\r\n    Gospel of Christ, which our Saviour commanded should be preached\r\n    to all nations, we might offer to you the cup of the means of\r\n    salvation.(219)\r\n\r\n    “Thus the goodness of the Supreme Majesty, which, by the word\r\n    alone of His command, made and created all things, the heaven, the\r\n    earth, the sea, and all that in them is, disposing the order by\r\n    which they should subsist, hath, ordaining all things, with the\r\n    counsel of His co-eternal Word, and the unity of the Holy Spirit,\r\n    made man after His own image and likeness, forming him out of the\r\n    mire of the earth; and granted him such high privilege of\r\n    distinction, as to place him above all else; so that, preserving\r\n    the bounds of the law of his being, his substance should be\r\n    established to eternity. This God,—Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,\r\n    the undivided Trinity,—from the east unto the west, through faith\r\n    by confession to the saving of their souls, men worship and adore\r\n    as the Creator of all things, and their own Maker; to Whom also\r\n    the heights of empire and the powers of the world are subject,\r\n    because the pre-eminence of all kingdoms is granted by His\r\n    disposition. It hath pleased Him, therefore, in the mercy of His\r\n    loving kindness, and for the greater benefit of all His\r\n    creatures,(220) by the fire of His Holy Spirit wonderfully to\r\n    kindle the cold hearts even of the nations seated at the\r\n    extremities of the earth in the knowledge of Himself.\r\n\r\n    “For we suppose, since the two countries are near together, that\r\n    your Highness has fully understood what the clemency of our\r\n    Redeemer has effected in the enlightenment of our illustrious son,\r\n    King Eadbald, and the nations under his rule; we therefore trust,\r\n    with assured confidence that, through the long-suffering of\r\n    Heaven, His wonderful gift will be also conferred on you; since,\r\n    indeed, we have learnt that your illustrious consort, who is\r\n    discerned to be one flesh with you, has been blessed with the\r\n    reward of eternity, through the regeneration of Holy Baptism. We\r\n    have, therefore, taken care by this letter, with all the goodwill\r\n    of heartfelt love, to exhort your Highness, that, abhorring idols\r\n    and their worship, and despising the foolishness of temples, and\r\n    the deceitful flatteries of auguries, you believe in God the\r\n    Father Almighty, and His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, to\r\n    the end that, believing and being released from the bonds of\r\n    captivity to the Devil, you may, through the co-operating power of\r\n    the Holy and undivided Trinity, be partaker of the eternal life.\r\n\r\n    “How great guilt they lie under, who adhere in their worship to\r\n    the pernicious superstition of idolatry, appears by the examples\r\n    of the perishing of those whom they worship. Wherefore it is said\r\n    of them by the Psalmist, ‘All the gods of the nations are\r\n    devils,(221) but the Lord made the heavens.’ And again, ‘Eyes have\r\n    they, but they see not; they have ears, but they hear not; noses\r\n    have they, but they smell not; they have hands, but they handle\r\n    not; feet have they, but they walk not. Therefore they are made\r\n    like unto those that place the hope of their confidence in\r\n    them.’(222) For how can they have power to help any man, that are\r\n    made out of corruptible matter, by the hands of your inferiors and\r\n    subjects, and on which, by employing human art, you have bestowed\r\n    a lifeless similitude of members? which, moreover, unless they be\r\n    moved by you, will not be able to walk; but, like a stone fixed in\r\n    one place, being so formed, and having no understanding, sunk in\r\n    insensibility, have no power of doing harm or good. We cannot,\r\n    therefore, by any manner of discernment conceive how you come to\r\n    be so deceived as to follow and worship those gods, to whom you\r\n    yourselves have given the likeness of a body.\r\n\r\n    “It behoves you, therefore, by taking upon you the sign of the\r\n    Holy Cross, by which the human race has been redeemed, to root out\r\n    of your hearts all the accursed deceitfulness of the snares of the\r\n    Devil, who is ever the jealous foe of the works of the Divine\r\n    Goodness, and to put forth your hands and with all your might set\r\n    to work to break in pieces and destroy those which you have\r\n    hitherto fashioned of wood or stone to be your gods. For the very\r\n    destruction and decay of these, which never had the breath of life\r\n    in them, nor could in any wise receive feeling from their makers,\r\n    may plainly teach you how worthless that was which you hitherto\r\n    worshipped. For you yourselves, who have received the breath of\r\n    life from the Lord, are certainly better than these which are\r\n    wrought with hands, seeing that Almighty God has appointed you to\r\n    be descended, after many ages and through many generations, from\r\n    the first man whom he formed. Draw near, then, to the knowledge of\r\n    Him Who created you, Who breathed the breath of life into you, Who\r\n    sent His only-begotten Son for your redemption, to save you from\r\n    original sin, that being delivered from the power of the Devil’s\r\n    perversity and wickedness, He might bestow on you a heavenly\r\n    reward.\r\n\r\n    “Hearken to the words of the preachers, and the Gospel of God,\r\n    which they declare to you, to the end that, believing, as has been\r\n    said before more than once, in God the Father Almighty, and in\r\n    Jesus Christ His Son, and the Holy Ghost, and the indivisible\r\n    Trinity, having put to flight the thoughts of devils, and driven\r\n    from you the temptations of the venomous and deceitful enemy, and\r\n    being born again of water and the Holy Ghost, you may, through the\r\n    aid of His bounty, dwell in the brightness of eternal glory with\r\n    Him in Whom you shall have believed.\r\n\r\n    “We have, moreover, sent you the blessing of your protector, the\r\n    blessed Peter, chief of the Apostles, to wit, a shirt of proof\r\n    with one gold ornament, and one cloak of Ancyra, which we pray\r\n    your Highness to accept with all the goodwill with which it is\r\n    sent by us.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XI. How Pope Boniface advised the king’s consort to use her best\r\nendeavours for his salvation. [_Circ._ 625 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same pope also wrote to King Edwin’s consort, Ethelberg, to this\r\neffect:\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE COPY OF THE LETTER OF THE MOST BLESSED AND APOSTOLIC BONIFACE,\r\n    POPE OF THE CITY OF ROME, TO ETHELBERG, KING EDWIN’S QUEEN.\r\n\r\n    “_To the illustrious lady his daughter, Queen Ethelberg, Boniface,\r\n    bishop, servant of the servants of God._ The goodness of our\r\n    Redeemer has in His abundant Providence offered the means of\r\n    salvation to the human race, which He rescued, by the shedding of\r\n    His precious Blood, from the bonds of captivity to the Devil; to\r\n    the end that, when He had made known His name in divers ways to\r\n    the nations, they might acknowledge their Creator by embracing the\r\n    mystery of the Christian faith. And this the mystical purification\r\n    of your regeneration plainly shows to have been bestowed upon the\r\n    mind of your Highness by God’s gift. Our heart, therefore, has\r\n    greatly rejoiced in the benefit bestowed by the bounty of the\r\n    Lord, for that He has vouchsafed, in your confession, to kindle a\r\n    spark of the orthodox religion, by which He might the more easily\r\n    inflame with the love of Himself the understanding, not only of\r\n    your illustrious consort, but also of all the nation that is\r\n    subject to you.\r\n\r\n    “For we have been informed by those, who came to acquaint us with\r\n    the laudable conversion of our illustrious son, King Eadbald, that\r\n    your Highness, also, having received the wonderful mystery of the\r\n    Christian faith, continually excels in the performance of works\r\n    pious and acceptable to God; that you likewise carefully refrain\r\n    from the worship of idols, and the deceits of temples and\r\n    auguries, and with unimpaired devotion, give yourself so wholly to\r\n    the love of your Redeemer, as never to cease from lending your aid\r\n    in spreading the Christian faith. But when our fatherly love\r\n    earnestly inquired concerning your illustrious consort, we were\r\n    given to understand, that he still served abominable idols, and\r\n    delayed to yield obedience in giving ear to the voice of the\r\n    preachers. This occasioned us no small grief, that he that is one\r\n    flesh with you still remained a stranger to the knowledge of the\r\n    supreme and undivided Trinity. Whereupon we, in our fatherly care,\r\n    have not delayed to admonish and exhort your Christian Highness,\r\n    to the end that, filled with the support of the Divine\r\n    inspiration, you should not defer to strive, both in season and\r\n    out of season, that with the co-operating power of our Lord and\r\n    Saviour Jesus Christ, your husband also may be added to the number\r\n    of Christians; that so you may uphold the rights of marriage in\r\n    the bond of a holy and unblemished union. For it is written, ‘They\r\n    twain shall be one flesh.’(223) How then can it be said, that\r\n    there is unity in the bond between you, if he continues a stranger\r\n    to the brightness of your faith, separated from it by the darkness\r\n    of detestable error?\r\n\r\n    “Wherefore, applying yourself continually to prayer, do not cease\r\n    to beg of the long-suffering of the Divine Mercy the benefits of\r\n    his illumination; to the end, that those whom the union of carnal\r\n    affection has manifestly made in a manner to be one body, may,\r\n    after this life continue in perpetual fellowship, by the unity of\r\n    faith. Persist, therefore, illustrious daughter, and to the utmost\r\n    of your power endeavour to soften the hardness of his heart by\r\n    carefully making known to him the Divine precepts; pouring into\r\n    his mind a knowledge of the greatness of that mystery which you\r\n    have received by faith, and of the marvellous reward which, by the\r\n    new birth, you have been made worthy to obtain. Inflame the\r\n    coldness of his heart by the message of the Holy Ghost, that he\r\n    may put from him the deadness of an evil worship, and the warmth\r\n    of the Divine faith may kindle his understanding through your\r\n    frequent exhortations; and so the testimony of Holy Scripture may\r\n    shine forth clearly, fulfilled by you, ‘The unbelieving husband\r\n    shall be saved by the believing wife.’(224) For to this end you\r\n    have obtained the mercy of the Lord’s goodness, that you might\r\n    restore with increase to your Redeemer the fruit of faith and of\r\n    the benefits entrusted to your hands. That you may be able to\r\n    fulfil this task, supported by the help of His loving kindness we\r\n    do not cease to implore with frequent prayers.\r\n\r\n    “Having premised thus much, in pursuance of the duty of our\r\n    fatherly affection, we exhort you, that when the opportunity of a\r\n    bearer shall offer, you will with all speed comfort us with the\r\n    glad tidings of the wonderful work which the heavenly Power shall\r\n    vouchsafe to perform by your means in the conversion(225) of your\r\n    consort, and of the nation subject to you; to the end, that our\r\n    solicitude, which earnestly awaits the fulfilment of its desire in\r\n    the soul’s salvation of you and yours, may, by hearing from you,\r\n    be set at rest; and that we, discerning more fully the light of\r\n    the Divine propitiation shed abroad in you, may with a joyful\r\n    confession abundantly return due thanks to God, the Giver of all\r\n    good things, and to the blessed Peter, the chief of the Apostles.\r\n\r\n    “We have, moreover, sent you the blessing of your protector, the\r\n    blessed Peter, the chief of the Apostles, to wit, a silver\r\n    looking-glass, and a gilded ivory comb, which we pray your\r\n    Highness to accept with all the goodwill with which it is sent by\r\n    us.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XII. How Edwin was persuaded to believe by a vision which he had\r\nonce seen when he was in exile. [_Circ._ 616 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThus wrote the aforesaid Pope Boniface for the salvation of King Edwin and\r\nhis nation. But a heavenly vision, which the Divine Goodness was pleased\r\nonce to reveal to this king, when he was in banishment at the court of\r\nRedwald, king of the Angles,(226) was of no little use in urging him to\r\nreceive and understand the doctrines of salvation. For when Paulinus\r\nperceived that it was a difficult task to incline the king’s proud mind to\r\nthe humility of the way of salvation and the reception of the mystery of\r\nthe life-giving Cross, and at the same time was employing the word of\r\nexhortation with men, and prayer to the Divine Goodness, for the salvation\r\nof Edwin and his subjects; at length, as we may suppose, it was shown him\r\nin spirit what the nature of the vision was that had been formerly\r\nrevealed from Heaven to the king. Then he lost no time, but immediately\r\nadmonished the king to perform the vow which he had made, when he received\r\nthe vision, promising to fulfil it, if he should be delivered from the\r\ntroubles of that time, and advanced to the throne.\r\n\r\nThe vision was this. When Ethelfrid,(227) his predecessor, was persecuting\r\nhim, he wandered for many years as an exile, hiding in divers places and\r\nkingdoms, and at last came to Redwald, beseeching him to give him\r\nprotection against the snares of his powerful persecutor. Redwald\r\nwillingly received him, and promised to perform what was asked of him. But\r\nwhen Ethelfrid understood that he had appeared in that province, and that\r\nhe and his companions were hospitably entertained by Redwald, he sent\r\nmessengers to bribe that king with a great sum of money to murder him, but\r\nwithout effect. He sent a second and a third time, offering a greater\r\nbribe each time, and, moreover, threatening to make war on him if his\r\noffer should be despised. Redwald, whether terrified by his threats, or\r\nwon over by his gifts, complied with this request, and promised either to\r\nkill Edwin, or to deliver him up to the envoys. A faithful friend of his,\r\nhearing of this, went into his chamber, where he was going to bed, for it\r\nwas the first hour of the night; and calling him out, told him what the\r\nking had promised to do with him, adding, “If, therefore, you are willing,\r\nI will this very hour conduct you out of this province, and lead you to a\r\nplace where neither Redwald nor Ethelfrid shall ever find you.” He\r\nanswered, “I thank you for your good will, yet I cannot do what you\r\npropose, and be guilty of being the first to break the compact I have made\r\nwith so great a king, when he has done me no harm, nor shown any enmity to\r\nme; but, on the contrary, if I must die, let it rather be by his hand than\r\nby that of any meaner man. For whither shall I now fly, when I have for so\r\nmany long years been a vagabond through all the provinces of Britain, to\r\nescape the snares of my enemies?” His friend went away; Edwin remained\r\nalone without, and sitting with a heavy heart before the palace, began to\r\nbe overwhelmed with many thoughts, not knowing what to do, or which way to\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nWhen he had remained a long time in silent anguish of mind, consumed with\r\ninward fire,(228) on a sudden in the stillness of the dead of night he saw\r\napproaching a person, whose face and habit were strange to him, at sight\r\nof whom, seeing that he was unknown and unlooked for, he was not a little\r\nstartled. The stranger coming close up, saluted him, and asked why he sat\r\nthere in solitude on a stone troubled and wakeful at that time, when all\r\nothers were taking their rest, and were fast asleep. Edwin, in his turn,\r\nasked, what it was to him, whether he spent the night within doors or\r\nabroad. The stranger, in reply, said, “Do not think that I am ignorant of\r\nthe cause of your grief, your watching, and sitting alone without. For I\r\nknow of a surety who you are, and why you grieve, and the evils which you\r\nfear will soon fall upon you. But tell me, what reward you would give the\r\nman who should deliver you out of these troubles, and persuade Redwald\r\nneither to do you any harm himself, nor to deliver you up to be murdered\r\nby your enemies.” Edwin replied, that he would give such an one all that\r\nhe could in return for so great a benefit. The other further added, “What\r\nif he should also assure you, that your enemies should be destroyed, and\r\nyou should be a king surpassing in power, not only all your own ancestors,\r\nbut even all that have reigned before you in the English nation?” Edwin,\r\nencouraged by these questions, did not hesitate to promise that he would\r\nmake a fitting return to him who should confer such benefits upon him.\r\nThen the other spoke a third time and said, “But if he who should truly\r\nforetell that all these great blessings are about to befall you, could\r\nalso give you better and more profitable counsel for your life and\r\nsalvation than any of your fathers or kindred ever heard, do you consent\r\nto submit to him, and to follow his wholesome guidance?” Edwin at once\r\npromised that he would in all things follow the teaching of that man who\r\nshould deliver him from so many great calamities, and raise him to a\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nHaving received this answer, the man who talked to him laid his right hand\r\non his head saying, “When this sign shall be given you, remember this\r\npresent discourse that has passed between us, and do not delay the\r\nperformance of what you now promise.” Having uttered these words, he is\r\nsaid to have immediately vanished. So the king perceived that it was not a\r\nman, but a spirit, that had appeared to him.\r\n\r\nWhilst the royal youth still sat there alone, glad of the comfort he had\r\nreceived, but still troubled and earnestly pondering who he was, and\r\nwhence he came, that had so talked to him, his aforesaid friend came to\r\nhim, and greeting him with a glad countenance, “Rise,” said he, “go in;\r\ncalm and put away your anxious cares, and compose yourself in body and\r\nmind to sleep; for the king’s resolution is altered, and he designs to do\r\nyou no harm, but rather to keep his pledged faith; for when he had\r\nprivately made known to the queen his intention of doing what I told you\r\nbefore, she dissuaded him from it, reminding him that it was altogether\r\nunworthy of so great a king to sell his good friend in such distress for\r\ngold, and to sacrifice his honour, which is more valuable than all other\r\nadornments, for the love of money.” In short, the king did as has been\r\nsaid, and not only refused to deliver up the banished man to his enemy’s\r\nmessengers, but helped him to recover his kingdom. For as soon as the\r\nmessengers had returned home, he raised a mighty army to subdue Ethelfrid;\r\nwho, meeting him with much inferior forces, (for Redwald had not given him\r\ntime to gather and unite all his power,) was slain on the borders of the\r\nkingdom of Mercia, on the east side of the river that is called Idle.(229)\r\nIn this battle, Redwald’s son, called Raegenheri, was killed. Thus Edwin,\r\nin accordance with the prophecy he had received, not only escaped the\r\ndanger from his enemy, but, by his death, succeeded the king on the\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nKing Edwin, therefore, delaying to receive the Word of God at the\r\npreaching of Paulinus, and being wont for some time, as has been said, to\r\nsit many hours alone, and seriously to ponder with himself what he was to\r\ndo, and what religion he was to follow, the man of God came to him one\r\nday, laid his right hand on his head, and asked, whether he knew that\r\nsign? The king, trembling, was ready to fall down at his feet, but he\r\nraised him up, and speaking to him with the voice of a friend, said,\r\n“Behold, by the gift of God you have escaped the hands of the enemies whom\r\nyou feared. Behold, you have obtained of His bounty the kingdom which you\r\ndesired. Take heed not to delay to perform your third promise; accept the\r\nfaith, and keep the precepts of Him Who, delivering you from temporal\r\nadversity, has raised you to the honour of a temporal kingdom; and if,\r\nfrom this time forward, you shall be obedient to His will, which through\r\nme He signifies to you, He will also deliver you from the everlasting\r\ntorments of the wicked, and make you partaker with Him of His eternal\r\nkingdom in heaven.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XIII. Of the Council he held with his chief men concerning their\r\nreception of the faith of Christ, and how the high priest profaned his own\r\naltars. [627 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe king, hearing these words, answered, that he was both willing and\r\nbound to receive the faith which Paulinus taught; but that he would confer\r\nabout it with his chief friends and counsellors, to the end that if they\r\nalso were of his opinion, they might all together be consecrated to Christ\r\nin the font of life. Paulinus consenting, the king did as he said; for,\r\nholding a council with the wise men,(230) he asked of every one in\r\nparticular what he thought of this doctrine hitherto unknown to them, and\r\nthe new worship of God that was preached? The chief of his own priests,\r\nCoifi, immediately answered him, “O king, consider what this is which is\r\nnow preached to us; for I verily declare to you what I have learnt beyond\r\ndoubt, that the religion which we have hitherto professed has no virtue in\r\nit and no profit. For none of your people has applied himself more\r\ndiligently to the worship of our gods than I; and yet there are many who\r\nreceive greater favours from you, and are more preferred than I, and are\r\nmore prosperous in all that they undertake to do or to get. Now if the\r\ngods were good for any thing, they would rather forward me, who have been\r\ncareful to serve them with greater zeal. It remains, therefore, that if\r\nupon examination you find those new doctrines, which are now preached to\r\nus, better and more efficacious, we hasten to receive them without any\r\ndelay.”\r\n\r\nAnother of the king’s chief men, approving of his wise words and\r\nexhortations, added thereafter: “The present life of man upon earth, O\r\nking, seems to me, in comparison with that time which is unknown to us,\r\nlike to the swift flight of a sparrow through the house wherein you sit at\r\nsupper in winter, with your ealdormen and thegns, while the fire blazes in\r\nthe midst, and the hall is warmed, but the wintry storms of rain or snow\r\nare raging abroad. The sparrow, flying in at one door and immediately out\r\nat another, whilst he is within, is safe from the wintry tempest; but\r\nafter a short space of fair weather, he immediately vanishes out of your\r\nsight, passing from winter into winter again. So this life of man appears\r\nfor a little while, but of what is to follow or what went before we know\r\nnothing at all. If, therefore, this new doctrine tells us something more\r\ncertain, it seems justly to deserve to be followed.” The other elders and\r\nking’s counsellors, by Divine prompting, spoke to the same effect.\r\n\r\nBut Coifi added, that he wished more attentively to hear Paulinus\r\ndiscourse concerning the God Whom he preached. When he did so, at the\r\nking’s command, Coifi, hearing his words, cried out, “This long time I\r\nhave perceived that what we worshipped was naught; because the more\r\ndiligently I sought after truth in that worship, the less I found it. But\r\nnow I freely confess, that such truth evidently appears in this preaching\r\nas can confer on us the gifts of life, of salvation, and of eternal\r\nhappiness. For which reason my counsel is, O king, that we instantly give\r\nup to ban and fire those temples and altars which we have consecrated\r\nwithout reaping any benefit from them.” In brief, the king openly assented\r\nto the preaching of the Gospel by Paulinus, and renouncing idolatry,\r\ndeclared that he received the faith of Christ: and when he inquired of the\r\naforesaid high priest of his religion, who should first desecrate the\r\naltars and temples of their idols, with the precincts that were about\r\nthem, he answered, “I; for who can more fittingly than myself destroy\r\nthose things which I worshipped in my folly, for an example to all others,\r\nthrough the wisdom which has been given me by the true God?” Then\r\nimmediately, in contempt of his vain superstitions, he desired the king to\r\nfurnish him with arms and a stallion, that he might mount and go forth to\r\ndestroy the idols; for it was not lawful before for the high priest either\r\nto carry arms, or to ride on anything but a mare. Having, therefore, girt\r\na sword about him, with a spear in his hand, he mounted the king’s\r\nstallion, and went his way to the idols. The multitude, beholding it,\r\nthought that he was mad; but as soon as he drew near the temple he did not\r\ndelay to desecrate it by casting into it the spear which he held; and\r\nrejoicing in the knowledge of the worship of the true God, he commanded\r\nhis companions to tear down and set on fire the temple, with all its\r\nprecincts. This place where the idols once stood is still shown, not far\r\nfrom York, to the eastward, beyond the river Derwent, and is now called\r\nGodmunddingaham,(231) where the high priest, by the inspiration of the\r\ntrue God, profaned and destroyed the altars which he had himself\r\nconsecrated.(232)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XIV. How King Edwin and his nation became Christians; and where\r\nPaulinus baptized them. [627 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Edwin, therefore, with all the nobility of the nation, and a large\r\nnumber of the common sort, received the faith, and the washing of holy\r\nregeneration, in the eleventh year of his reign, which is the year of our\r\nLord 627, and about one hundred and eighty after the coming of the English\r\ninto Britain. He was baptized at York, on the holy day of Easter,(233)\r\nbeing the 12th of April, in the church of St. Peter the Apostle, which he\r\nhimself had built of timber there in haste, whilst he was a catechumen\r\nreceiving instruction in order to be admitted to baptism. In that city\r\nalso he bestowed upon his instructor and bishop, Paulinus, his episcopal\r\nsee. But as soon as he was baptized, he set about building, by the\r\ndirection of Paulinus, in the same place a larger and nobler church of\r\nstone, in the midst whereof the oratory which he had first erected should\r\nbe enclosed.(234) Having, therefore, laid the foundation, he began to\r\nbuild the church square, encompassing the former oratory. But before the\r\nwalls were raised to their full height, the cruel death(235) of the king\r\nleft that work to be finished by Oswald his successor. Paulinus, for the\r\nspace of six years from this time, that is, till the end of the king’s\r\nreign, with his consent and favour, preached the Word of God in that\r\ncountry, and as many as were foreordained to eternal life believed and\r\nwere baptized. Among them were Osfrid and Eadfrid, King Edwin’s sons who\r\nwere both born to him, whilst he was in banishment, of Quenburga, the\r\ndaughter of Cearl, king of the Mercians.\r\n\r\nAfterwards other children of his, by Queen Ethelberg, were baptized,\r\nEthelhun and his daughter Ethelthryth, and another, Wuscfrea, a son; the\r\nfirst two were snatched out of this life whilst they were still in the\r\nwhite garments of the newly-baptized,(236) and buried in the church at\r\nYork. Yffi,(237) the son of Osfrid, was also baptized, and many other\r\nnoble and royal persons. So great was then the fervour of the faith, as is\r\nreported, and the desire for the laver of salvation among the nation of\r\nthe Northumbrians, that Paulinus at a certain time coming with the king\r\nand queen to the royal township, which is called Adgefrin,(238) stayed\r\nthere with them thirty-six days, fully occupied in catechizing and\r\nbaptizing; during which days, from morning till night, he did nothing else\r\nbut instruct the people resorting from all villages and places, in\r\nChrist’s saving Word; and when they were instructed, he washed them with\r\nthe water of absolution in the river Glen,(239) which is close by. This\r\ntownship, under the following kings, was abandoned, and another was built\r\ninstead of it, at the place called Maelmin.(240)\r\n\r\nThese things happened in the province of the Bernicians; but in that of\r\nthe Deiri also, where he was wont often to be with the king, he baptized\r\nin the river Swale, which runs by the village of Cataract;(241) for as yet\r\noratories, or baptisteries, could not be built in the early infancy of the\r\nChurch in those parts. But in Campodonum,(242) where there was then a\r\nroyal township, he built a church which the pagans, by whom King Edwin was\r\nslain, afterwards burnt, together with all the place. Instead of this\r\nroyal seat the later kings built themselves a township in the country\r\ncalled Loidis.(243) But the altar, being of stone, escaped the fire and is\r\nstill preserved in the monastery of the most reverend abbot and priest,\r\nThrydwulf, which is in the forest of Elmet.(244)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XV. How the province of the East Angles received the faith of\r\nChrist. [627-628 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEdwin was so zealous for the true worship, that he likewise persuaded\r\nEarpwald, king of the East Angles, and son of Redwald, to abandon his\r\nidolatrous superstitions, and with his whole province to receive the faith\r\nand mysteries of Christ. And indeed his father Redwald had long before\r\nbeen initiated into the mysteries of the Christian faith in Kent, but in\r\nvain; for on his return home, he was seduced by his wife and certain\r\nperverse teachers, and turned aside from the sincerity of the faith; and\r\nthus his latter state was worse than the former; so that, like the\r\nSamaritans of old, he seemed at the same time to serve Christ and the gods\r\nwhom he served before; and in the same temple he had an altar for the\r\nChristian Sacrifice, and another small one at which to offer victims to\r\ndevils. Aldwulf,(245) king of that same province, who lived in our time,\r\ntestifies that this temple had stood until his time, and that he had seen\r\nit when he was a boy. The aforesaid King Redwald was noble by birth,\r\nthough ignoble in his actions, being the son of Tytilus, whose father was\r\nUuffa, from whom the kings of the East Angles are called Uuffings.(246)\r\n\r\nEarpwald, not long after he had embraced the Christian faith, was slain by\r\none Ricbert, a pagan; and from that time the province was in error for\r\nthree years, till Sigbert succeeded to the kingdom,(247) brother to the\r\nsame Earpwald, a most Christian and learned man, who was banished, and\r\nwent to live in Gaul during his brother’s life, and was there initiated\r\ninto the mysteries of the faith, whereof he made it his business to cause\r\nall his province to partake as soon as he came to the throne. His\r\nexertions were nobly promoted by Bishop Felix,(248) who, coming to\r\nHonorius, the archbishop,(249) from the parts of Burgundy, where he had\r\nbeen born and ordained, and having told him what he desired, was sent by\r\nhim to preach the Word of life to the aforesaid nation of the Angles. Nor\r\nwere his good wishes in vain; for the pious labourer in the spiritual\r\nfield reaped therein a great harvest of believers, delivering all that\r\nprovince (according to the inner signification of his name) from long\r\niniquity and unhappiness, and bringing it to the faith and works of\r\nrighteousness, and the gifts of everlasting happiness. He had the see of\r\nhis bishopric appointed him in the city Dommoc,(250) and having presided\r\nover the same province with pontifical authority seventeen years, he ended\r\nhis days there in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XVI. How Paulinus preached in the province of Lindsey; and of the\r\ncharacter of the reign of Edwin. [_Circ._ 628 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPaulinus also preached the Word to the province of Lindsey,(251) which is\r\nthe first on the south side of the river Humber, stretching as far as the\r\nsea; and he first converted to the Lord the reeve of the city of Lincoln,\r\nwhose name was Blaecca, with his whole house. He likewise built, in that\r\ncity, a stone church of beautiful workmanship; the roof of which has\r\neither fallen through long neglect, or been thrown down by enemies, but\r\nthe walls are still to be seen standing, and every year miraculous cures\r\nare wrought in that place, for the benefit of those who have faith to seek\r\nthem. In that church, when Justus had departed to Christ, Paulinus\r\nconsecrated Honorius bishop in his stead, as will be hereafter mentioned\r\nin its proper place.(252) A certain priest and abbot of the monastery of\r\nPeartaneu,(253) a man of singular veracity, whose name was Deda, told me\r\nconcerning the faith of this province that an old man had informed him\r\nthat he himself had been baptized at noon-day, by Bishop Paulinus, in the\r\npresence of King Edwin, and with him a great multitude of the people, in\r\nthe river Trent, near the city, which in the English tongue is called\r\nTiouulfingacaestir;(254) and he was also wont to describe the person of\r\nthe same Paulinus, saying that he was tall of stature, stooping somewhat,\r\nhis hair black, his visage thin, his nose slender and aquiline, his aspect\r\nboth venerable and awe-inspiring. He had also with him in the ministry,\r\nJames, the deacon,(255) a man of zeal and great fame in Christ and in the\r\nchurch, who lived even to our days.\r\n\r\nIt is told that there was then such perfect peace in Britain, wheresoever\r\nthe dominion of King Edwin extended, that, as is still proverbially said,\r\na woman with her new-born babe might walk throughout the island, from sea\r\nto sea, without receiving any harm. That king took such care for the good\r\nof his nation, that in several places where he had seen clear springs near\r\nthe highways, he caused stakes to be fixed, with copper drinking-vessels\r\nhanging on them, for the refreshment of travellers; nor durst any man\r\ntouch them for any other purpose than that for which they were designed,\r\neither through the great dread they had of the king, or for the affection\r\nwhich they bore him. His dignity was so great throughout his dominions,\r\nthat not only were his banners borne before him in battle, but even in\r\ntime of peace, when he rode about his cities, townships, or provinces,\r\nwith his thegns, the standard-bearer was always wont to go before him.\r\nAlso, when he walked anywhere along the streets, that sort of banner which\r\nthe Romans call Tufa,(256) and the English, Thuuf, was in like manner\r\nborne before him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XVII. How Edwin received letters of exhortation from Pope Honorius,\r\nwho also sent the pall to Paulinus. [634 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that time Honorius, successor to Boniface, was Bishop of the Apostolic\r\nsee. When he learned that the nation of the Northumbrians, with their\r\nking, had been, by the preaching of Paulinus, converted to the faith and\r\nconfession of Christ, he sent the pall to the said Paulinus, and with it\r\nletters of exhortation to King Edwin, with fatherly love inflaming his\r\nzeal, to the end that he and his people should persist in belief of the\r\ntruth which they had received. The contents of which letter were as\r\nfollow:\r\n\r\n“_To his most noble son, and excellent lord, Edwin king of the Angles,\r\nBishop Honorius, servant of the servants of God, greeting._ The\r\nwholeheartedness of your Christian Majesty, in the worship of your\r\nCreator, is so inflamed with the fire of faith, that it shines out far and\r\nwide, and, being reported throughout the world, brings forth plentiful\r\nfruits of your labours. For the terms of your kingship you know to be\r\nthis, that taught by orthodox preaching the knowledge of your King and\r\nCreator, you believe and worship God, and as far as man is able, pay Him\r\nthe sincere devotion of your mind. For what else are we able to offer to\r\nour God, but our readiness to worship Him and to pay Him our vows,\r\npersisting in good actions, and confessing Him the Creator of mankind?\r\nAnd, therefore, most excellent son, we exhort you with such fatherly love\r\nas is meet, to labour to preserve this gift in every way, by earnest\r\nstriving and constant prayer, in that the Divine Mercy has vouchsafed to\r\ncall you to His grace; to the end that He, Who has been pleased to deliver\r\nyou from all errors, and bring you to the knowledge of His name in this\r\npresent world, may likewise prepare a place for you in the heavenly\r\ncountry. Employing yourself, therefore, in reading frequently the works of\r\nmy lord Gregory, your Evangelist, of apostolic memory, keep before your\r\neyes that love of his doctrine, which he zealously bestowed for the sake\r\nof your souls; that his prayers may exalt your kingdom and people, and\r\npresent you faultless before Almighty God. We are preparing with a willing\r\nmind immediately to grant those things which you hoped would be by us\r\nordained for your bishops, and this we do on account of the sincerity of\r\nyour faith, which has been made known to us abundantly in terms of praise\r\nby the bearers of these presents. We have sent two palls to the two\r\nmetropolitans, Honorius and Paulinus;(257) to the intent, that when either\r\nof them shall be called out of this world to his Creator, the other may,\r\nby this authority of ours, substitute another bishop in his place; which\r\nprivilege we are induced to grant by the warmth of our love for you, as\r\nwell as by reason of the great extent of the provinces which lie between\r\nus and you; that we may in all things support your devotion and likewise\r\nsatisfy your desires. May God’s grace preserve your Highness in safety!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XVIII. How Honorius, who succeeded Justus in the bishopric of\r\nCanterbury, received the pall and letters from Pope Honorius. [634 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Archbishop Justus was taken up to the heavenly kingdom,\r\non the 10th of November,(258) and Honorius, who was elected to the see in\r\nhis stead, came to Paulinus to be ordained, and meeting him at Lincoln was\r\nthere consecrated the fifth prelate of the Church of Canterbury from\r\nAugustine. To him also the aforesaid Pope Honorius sent the pall, and a\r\nletter, wherein he ordains the same that he had before ordained in his\r\nepistle to King Edwin, to wit, that when either the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury or of York shall depart this life, the survivor, being of the\r\nsame degree, shall have power to ordain another bishop in the room of him\r\nthat is departed; that it might not be necessary always to undertake the\r\ntoilsome journey to Rome, at so great a distance by sea and land, to\r\nordain an archbishop. Which letter we have also thought fit to insert in\r\nthis our history:\r\n\r\n“_Honorius to his most beloved brother Honorius:_ Among the many good\r\ngifts which the mercy of our Redeemer is pleased to bestow on His servants\r\nHe grants to us in His bounty, graciously conferred on us by His goodness,\r\nthe special blessing of realizing by brotherly intercourse, as it were\r\nface to face, our mutual love. For which gift we continually render thanks\r\nto His Majesty; and we humbly beseech Him, that He will ever confirm your\r\nlabour, beloved, in preaching the Gospel, and bringing forth fruit, and\r\nfollowing the rule of your master and head, the holy Gregory; and that,\r\nfor the advancement of His Church, He may by your means raise up further\r\nincrease; to the end, that through faith and works, in the fear and love\r\nof God, what you and your predecessors have already gained from the seed\r\nsown by our lord Gregory, may grow strong and be further extended; that so\r\nthe promises spoken by our Lord may hereafter be brought to pass in you;\r\nand that these words may summon you to everlasting happiness: ‘Come unto\r\nMe all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you.’(259)\r\nAnd again, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful\r\nover a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou\r\ninto the joy of thy Lord.’(260) And we, most beloved brothers, sending you\r\nfirst these words of exhortation out of our enduring charity, do not fail\r\nfurther to grant those things which we perceive may be suitable for the\r\nprivileges of your Churches.\r\n\r\n“Wherefore, in accordance with your request, and that of the kings our\r\nsons,(261) we do hereby in the name of the blessed Peter, chief of the\r\nApostles, grant you authority, that when the Divine Grace shall call\r\neither of you to Himself, the survivor shall ordain a bishop in the room\r\nof him that is deceased. To which end also we have sent a pall to each of\r\nyou, beloved, for celebrating the said ordination; that by the authority\r\nwhich we hereby commit to you, you may make an ordination acceptable to\r\nGod; because the long distance of sea and land that lies between us and\r\nyou, has obliged us to grant you this, that no loss may happen to your\r\nChurch in any way, on any pretext whatever, but that the devotion of the\r\npeople committed to you may increase the more. God preserve you in safety,\r\nmost dear brother! Given the 11th day of June, in the reign of these our\r\nlords and emperors, in the twenty-fourth year of the reign of Heraclius,\r\nand the twenty-third after his consulship; and in the twenty-third of his\r\nson Constantine, and the third after his consulship; and in the third year\r\nof the most prosperous Caesar, his son Heraclius,(262) the seventh\r\nindiction; that is, in the year of our Lord, 634.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XIX. How the aforesaid Honorius first, and afterwards John, wrote\r\nletters to the nation of the Scots, concerning the observance of Easter,\r\nand the Pelagian heresy. [640 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same Pope Honorius also wrote to the Scots,(263) whom he had found to\r\nerr in the observance of the holy Festival of Easter, as has been shown\r\nabove, with subtlety of argument exhorting them not to think themselves,\r\nfew as they were, and placed in the utmost borders of the earth, wiser\r\nthan all the ancient and modern Churches of Christ, throughout the world;\r\nand not to celebrate a different Easter, contrary to the Paschal\r\ncalculation and the decrees of all the bishops upon earth sitting in\r\nsynod. Likewise John,(264) who succeeded Severinus, successor to the same\r\nHonorius, being yet but Pope elect, sent to them letters of great\r\nauthority and erudition for the purpose of correcting the same error;\r\nevidently showing, that Easter Sunday is to be found between the fifteenth\r\nof the moon and the twenty-first, as was approved in the Council of\r\nNicaea.(265) He also in the same epistle admonished them to guard against\r\nthe Pelagian heresy,(266) and reject it, for he had been informed that it\r\nwas again springing up among them. The beginning of the epistle was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“_To our most beloved and most holy Tomianus, Columbanus, Cromanus,\r\nDinnaus, and Baithanus, bishops; to __ Cromanus, Ernianus, Laistranus,\r\nScellanus, and Segenus, priests; to Saranus and the rest of the Scottish\r\ndoctors and abbots, Hilarus, the arch-presbyter, and vice-gerent of the\r\nholy Apostolic See; John, the deacon, and elect in the name of God;\r\nlikewise John, the chief of the notaries and vice-gerent of the holy\r\nApostolic See, and John, the servant of God, and counsellor of the same\r\nApostolic See._(267) The writings which were brought by the bearers to\r\nPope Severinus, of holy memory, were left, when he departed from the light\r\nof this world, without an answer to the questions contained in them. Lest\r\nany obscurity should long remain undispelled in a matter of so great\r\nmoment, we opened the same, and found that some in your province,\r\nendeavouring to revive a new heresy out of an old one, contrary to the\r\northodox faith, do through the darkness of their minds reject our Easter,\r\nwhen Christ was sacrificed; and contend that the same should be kept with\r\nthe Hebrews on the fourteenth of the moon.”(268)\r\n\r\nBy this beginning of the epistle it evidently appears that this heresy\r\narose among them in very late times, and that not all their nation, but\r\nonly some of them, were involved in the same.\r\n\r\nAfter having laid down the manner of keeping Easter, they add this\r\nconcerning the Pelagians in the same epistle:\r\n\r\n“And we have also learnt that the poison of the Pelagian heresy again\r\nsprings up among you; we, therefore, exhort you, that you put away from\r\nyour thoughts all such venomous and superstitious wickedness. For you\r\ncannot be ignorant how that execrable heresy has been condemned; for it\r\nhas not only been abolished these two hundred years, but it is also daily\r\ncondemned by us and buried under our perpetual ban; and we exhort you not\r\nto rake up the ashes of those whose weapons have been burnt. For who would\r\nnot detest that insolent and impious assertion, ‘That man can live without\r\nsin of his own free will, and not through the grace of God?’ And in the\r\nfirst place, it is blasphemous folly to say that man is without sin, which\r\nnone can be, but only the one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ\r\nJesus, Who was conceived and born without sin; for all other men, being\r\nborn in original sin, are known to bear the mark of Adam’s transgression,\r\neven whilst they are without actual sin, according to the saying of the\r\nprophet, ‘For behold, I was conceived in iniquity; and in sin did my\r\nmother give birth to me.’ ”(269)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XX. How Edwin being slain, Paulinus returned into Kent, and had the\r\nbishopric of Rochester conferred upon him. [633 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEdwin reigned most gloriously seventeen years over the nations of the\r\nEnglish and the Britons, six whereof, as has been said, he also was a\r\nsoldier in the kingdom of Christ. Caedwalla,(270) king of the Britons,\r\nrebelled against him, being supported by the vigorous Penda, of the royal\r\nrace of the Mercians, who from that time governed that nation for\r\ntwenty-two years with varying success. A great battle being fought in the\r\nplain that is called Haethfelth,(271) Edwin was killed on the 12th of\r\nOctober, in the year of our Lord 633, being then forty-eight years of age,\r\nand all his army was either slain or dispersed. In the same war also,\r\nOsfrid,(272) one of his sons, a warlike youth, fell before him;\r\nEadfrid,(273) another of them, compelled by necessity, went over to King\r\nPenda, and was by him afterwards slain in the reign of Oswald, contrary to\r\nhis oath. At this time a great slaughter was made in the Church and nation\r\nof the Northumbrians; chiefly because one of the chiefs, by whom it was\r\ncarried on, was a pagan, and the other a barbarian, more cruel than a\r\npagan; for Penda, with all the nation of the Mercians, was an idolater,\r\nand a stranger to the name of Christ; but Caedwalla, though he professed\r\nand called himself a Christian, was so barbarous in his disposition and\r\nmanner of living, that he did not even spare women and innocent children,\r\nbut with bestial cruelty put all alike to death by torture, and overran\r\nall their country in his fury for a long time, intending to cut off all\r\nthe race of the English within the borders of Britain. Nor did he pay any\r\nrespect to the Christian religion which had sprung up among them; it being\r\nto this day the custom of the Britons to despise the faith and religion of\r\nthe English, and to have no part with them in anything any more than with\r\npagans. King Edwin’s head was brought to York, and afterwards taken into\r\nthe church of the blessed Peter the Apostle, which he had begun, but which\r\nhis successor Oswald finished, as has been said before. It was laid in the\r\nchapel of the holy Pope Gregory, from whose disciples he had received the\r\nword of life.(274)\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the Northumbrians being thrown into confusion at the moment\r\nof this disaster, when there seemed to be no prospect of safety except in\r\nflight, Paulinus, taking with him Queen Ethelberg, whom he had before\r\nbrought thither, returned into Kent by sea, and was very honourably\r\nreceived by the Archbishop Honorius and King Eadbald. He came thither\r\nunder the conduct of Bassus, a most valiant thegn of King Edwin, having\r\nwith him Eanfled, the daughter, and Wuscfrea, the son of Edwin, as well as\r\nYffi, the son of Osfrid, Edwin’s son.(275) Afterwards Ethelberg, for fear\r\nof the kings Eadbald and Oswald,(276) sent Wuscfrea and Yffi over into\r\nGaul to be bred up by King Dagobert,(277) who was her friend; and there\r\nthey both died in infancy, and were buried in the church with the honour\r\ndue to royal children and to Christ’s innocents. He also brought with him\r\nmany rich goods of King Edwin, among which were a large gold cross, and a\r\ngolden chalice, consecrated to the service of the altar, which are still\r\npreserved, and shown in the church of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nAt that time the church of Rochester had no pastor, for Romanus,(278) the\r\nbishop thereof, being sent on a mission to Pope Honorius by Archbishop\r\nJustus, was drowned in the Italian Sea; and thus Paulinus, at the request\r\nof Archbishop Honorius and King Eadbald, took upon him the charge of the\r\nsame, and held it until he too, in his own time, departed to heaven, with\r\nthe fruits of his glorious labours; and, dying in that Church, he left\r\nthere the pall which he had received from the Pope of Rome. He had left\r\nbehind him in his Church at York, James, the deacon,(279) a true churchman\r\nand a holy man, who continuing long after in that Church, by teaching and\r\nbaptizing, rescued much prey from the ancient enemy; and from him the\r\nvillage, where he chiefly dwelt, near Cataract,(280) has its name to this\r\nday. He had great skill in singing in church, and when the province was\r\nafterwards restored to peace, and the number of the faithful increased, he\r\nbegan to teach church music to many, according to the custom of the\r\nRomans, or of the Cantuarians.(281) And being old and full of days, as the\r\nScripture says, he went the way of his fathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. I. How King Edwin’s next successors lost both the faith of their\r\nnation and the kingdom; but the most Christian King Oswald retrieved both.\r\n[633 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEdwin being slain in battle, the kingdom of the Deiri, to which province\r\nhis family belonged, and where he first began to reign, passed to Osric,\r\nthe son of his uncle Aelfric, who, through the preaching of Paulinus, had\r\nalso received the mysteries of the faith. But the kingdom of the\r\nBernicians—for into these two provinces the nation of the Northumbrians\r\nwas formerly divided(282)—passed to Eanfrid, the son of Ethelfrid,(283)\r\nwho derived his origin from the royal family of that province. For all the\r\ntime that Edwin reigned, the sons of the aforesaid Ethelfrid, who had\r\nreigned before him, with many of the younger nobility, lived in banishment\r\namong the Scots or Picts, and were there instructed according to the\r\ndoctrine of the Scots, and were renewed with the grace of Baptism. Upon\r\nthe death of the king, their enemy, they were allowed to return home, and\r\nthe aforesaid Eanfrid, as the eldest of them, became king of the\r\nBernicians. Both those kings,(284) as soon as they obtained the government\r\nof their earthly kingdoms, abjured and betrayed the mysteries of the\r\nheavenly kingdom to which they had been admitted, and again delivered\r\nthemselves up to defilement and perdition through the abominations of\r\ntheir former idolatry.\r\n\r\nBut soon after, the king of the Britons, Caedwalla,(285) the unrighteous\r\ninstrument of rightful vengeance, slew them both. First, in the following\r\nsummer, he put Osric to death; for, being rashly besieged by him in the\r\nmunicipal town,(286) he sallied out on a sudden with all his forces, took\r\nhim by surprise, and destroyed him and all his army. Then, when he had\r\noccupied the provinces of the Northumbrians for a whole year,(287) not\r\nruling them like a victorious king, but ravaging them like a furious\r\ntyrant, he at length put an end to Eanfrid, in like manner, when he\r\nunadvisedly came to him with only twelve chosen soldiers, to sue for\r\npeace. To this day, that year is looked upon as ill-omened, and hateful to\r\nall good men; as well on account of the apostacy of the English kings, who\r\nhad renounced the mysteries of the faith, as of the outrageous tyranny of\r\nthe British king. Hence it has been generally agreed, in reckoning the\r\ndates of the kings, to abolish the memory of those faithless monarchs, and\r\nto assign that year to the reign of the following king, Oswald, a man\r\nbeloved of God. This king, after the death of his brother Eanfrid,(288)\r\nadvanced with an army, small, indeed, in number, but strengthened with the\r\nfaith of Christ; and the impious commander of the Britons, in spite of his\r\nvast forces, which he boasted nothing could withstand, was slain at a\r\nplace called in the English tongue Denisesburna, that is, the brook of\r\nDenis.(289)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. II. How, among innumerable other miracles of healing wrought by the\r\nwood of the cross, which King Oswald, being ready to engage against the\r\nbarbarians, erected, a certain man had his injured arm healed. [634 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe place is shown to this day, and held in much veneration, where Oswald,\r\nbeing about to engage in this battle, erected the symbol of the Holy\r\nCross, and knelt down and prayed to God that he would send help from\r\nHeaven to his worshippers in their sore need. Then, we are told, that the\r\ncross being made in haste, and the hole dug in which it was to be set up,\r\nthe king himself, in the ardour of his faith, laid hold of it and held it\r\nupright with both his hands, till the earth was heaped up by the soldiers\r\nand it was fixed. Thereupon, uplifting his voice, he cried to his whole\r\narmy, “Let us all kneel, and together beseech the true and living God\r\nAlmighty in His mercy to defend us from the proud and cruel enemy; for He\r\nknows that we have undertaken a just war for the safety of our nation.”\r\nAll did as he had commanded, and accordingly advancing towards the enemy\r\nwith the first dawn of day, they obtained the victory, as their faith\r\ndeserved. In the place where they prayed very many miracles of healing are\r\nknown to have been wrought, as a token and memorial of the king’s faith;\r\nfor even to this day, many are wont to cut off small splinters from the\r\nwood of the holy cross, and put them into water, which they give to sick\r\nmen or cattle to drink, or they sprinkle them therewith, and these are\r\npresently restored to health.\r\n\r\nThe place is called in the English tongue Hefenfelth, or the Heavenly\r\nField,(290) which name it undoubtedly received of old as a presage of what\r\nwas afterwards to happen, denoting, that the heavenly trophy was to be\r\nerected, the heavenly victory begun, and heavenly miracles shown forth to\r\nthis day. The place is near the wall in the north which the Romans\r\nformerly drew across the whole of Britain from sea to sea, to restrain the\r\nonslaught of the barbarous nations, as has been said before. Hither also\r\nthe brothers of the church of Hagustald,(291) which is not far distant,\r\nlong ago made it their custom to resort every year, on the day before that\r\non which King Oswald was afterwards slain, to keep vigils there for the\r\nhealth of his soul, and having sung many psalms of praise, to offer for\r\nhim in the morning the sacrifice of the Holy Oblation. And since that good\r\ncustom has spread, they have lately built a church there, which has\r\nattached additional sanctity and honour in the eyes of all men to that\r\nplace;(292) and this with good reason; for it appears that there was no\r\nsymbol of the Christian faith, no church, no altar erected throughout all\r\nthe nation of the Bernicians, before that new leader in war, prompted by\r\nthe zeal of his faith, set up this standard of the Cross as he was going\r\nto give battle to his barbarous enemy.\r\n\r\nNor is it foreign to our purpose to relate one of the many miracles that\r\nhave been wrought at this cross. One of the brothers of the same church of\r\nHagulstald, whose name is Bothelm, and who is still living, a few years\r\nago, walking carelessly on the ice at night, suddenly fell and broke his\r\narm; he was soon tormented with a most grievous pain in the broken part,\r\nso that he could not lift his arm to his mouth for the anguish. Hearing\r\none morning that one of the brothers designed to go up to the place of the\r\nholy cross, he desired him, on his return, to bring him a piece of that\r\nsacred wood, saying, he believed that with the mercy of God he might\r\nthereby be healed. The brother did as he was desired; and returning in the\r\nevening, when the brothers were sitting at table, gave him some of the old\r\nmoss which grew on the surface of the wood. As he sat at table, having no\r\nplace to bestow the gift which was brought him, he put it into his bosom;\r\nand forgetting, when he went to bed, to put it away, left it in his bosom.\r\nAwaking in the middle of the night, he felt something cold lying by his\r\nside, and putting his hand upon it to feel what it was, he found his arm\r\nand hand as sound as if he had never felt any such pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. III. How the same king Oswald, asking a bishop of the Scottish\r\nnation, had Aidan sent him, and granted him an episcopal see in the Isle\r\nof Lindisfarne. [635 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same Oswald, as soon as he ascended the throne, being desirous that\r\nall the nation under his rule should be endued with the grace of the\r\nChristian faith, whereof he had found happy experience in vanquishing the\r\nbarbarians, sent to the elders of the Scots,(293) among whom himself and\r\nhis followers, when in banishment, had received the sacrament of Baptism,\r\ndesiring that they would send him a bishop, by whose instruction and\r\nministry the English nation, which he governed, might learn the privileges\r\nand receive the Sacraments of the faith of our Lord. Nor were they slow in\r\ngranting his request; for they sent him Bishop Aidan, a man of singular\r\ngentleness, piety, and moderation; having a zeal of God, but not fully\r\naccording to knowledge; for he was wont to keep Easter Sunday according to\r\nthe custom of his country, which we have before so often mentioned,(294)\r\nfrom the fourteenth to the twentieth of the moon; the northern province of\r\nthe Scots, and all the nation of the Picts, at that time still celebrating\r\nEaster after that manner, and believing that in this observance they\r\nfollowed the writings of the holy and praiseworthy Father Anatolius.(295)\r\nWhether this be true, every instructed person can easily judge. But the\r\nScots which dwelt in the South of Ireland had long since, by the\r\nadmonition of the Bishop of the Apostolic see, learned to observe Easter\r\naccording to the canonical custom.(296)\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of the bishop, the king appointed him his episcopal see in\r\nthe island of Lindisfarne,(297) as he desired. Which place, as the tide\r\nebbs and flows, is twice a day enclosed by the waves of the sea like an\r\nisland; and again, twice, when the beach is left dry, becomes contiguous\r\nwith the land. The king also humbly and willingly in all things giving ear\r\nto his admonitions, industriously applied himself to build up and extend\r\nthe Church of Christ in his kingdom; wherein, when the bishop, who was not\r\nperfectly skilled in the English tongue, preached the Gospel, it was a\r\nfair sight to see the king himself interpreting the Word of God to his\r\nealdormen and thegns, for he had thoroughly learned the language of the\r\nScots during his long banishment. From that time many came daily into\r\nBritain from the country of the Scots, and with great devotion preached\r\nthe Word to those provinces of the English, over which King Oswald\r\nreigned, and those among them that had received priest’s orders,(298)\r\nadministered the grace of Baptism to the believers. Churches were built in\r\ndivers places; the people joyfully flocked together to hear the Word;\r\nlands and other property were given of the king’s bounty to found\r\nmonasteries; English children, as well as their elders, were instructed by\r\ntheir Scottish teachers in study and the observance of monastic\r\ndiscipline. For most of those who came to preach were monks. Bishop Aidan\r\nwas himself a monk, having been sent out from the island called Hii,(299)\r\nwhereof the monastery was for a long time the chief of almost all those of\r\nthe northern Scots,(300) and all those of the Picts, and had the direction\r\nof their people. That island belongs to Britain, being divided from it by\r\na small arm of the sea, but had been long since given by the Picts, who\r\ninhabit those parts of Britain, to the Scottish monks, because they had\r\nreceived the faith of Christ through their preaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. IV. When the nation of the Picts received the faith of Christ. [565\r\nA.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 565, when Justin, the younger, the successor of\r\nJustinian, obtained the government of the Roman empire, there came into\r\nBritain from Ireland a famous priest and abbot, marked as a monk by habit\r\nand manner of life, whose name was Columba,(301) to preach the word of God\r\nto the provinces of the northern Picts, who are separated from the\r\nsouthern parts belonging to that nation by steep and rugged mountains. For\r\nthe southern Picts, who dwell on this side of those mountains, had, it is\r\nsaid, long before forsaken the errors of idolatry, and received the true\r\nfaith by the preaching of Bishop Ninias,(302) a most reverend and holy man\r\nof the British nation, who had been regularly instructed at Rome in the\r\nfaith and mysteries of the truth; whose episcopal see, named after St.\r\nMartin the bishop, and famous for a church dedicated to him (wherein\r\nNinias himself and many other saints rest in the body), is now in the\r\npossession of the English nation. The place belongs to the province of the\r\nBernicians, and is commonly called the White House,(303) because he there\r\nbuilt a church of stone, which was not usual among the Britons.\r\n\r\nColumba came into Britain in the ninth year of the reign of Bridius, who\r\nwas the son of Meilochon,(304) and the powerful king of the Pictish\r\nnation, and he converted that nation to the faith of Christ, by his\r\npreaching and example. Wherefore he also received of them the gift of the\r\naforesaid island whereon to found a monastery. It is not a large island,\r\nbut contains about five families, according to the English computation;\r\nhis successors hold it to this day; he was also buried therein, having\r\ndied at the age of seventy-seven, about thirty-two years after he came\r\ninto Britain to preach.(305) Before he crossed over into Britain, he had\r\nbuilt a famous monastery in Ireland, which, from the great number of oaks,\r\nis in the Scottish tongue called Dearmach—The Field of Oaks.(306) From\r\nboth these monasteries, many others had their beginning through his\r\ndisciples, both in Britain and Ireland; but the island monastery where his\r\nbody lies, has the pre-eminence among them all.\r\n\r\nThat island has for its ruler an abbot, who is a priest, to whose\r\njurisdiction all the province, and even the bishops, contrary to the usual\r\nmethod, are bound to be subject, according to the example of their first\r\nteacher, who was not a bishop, but a priest and monk;(307) of whose life\r\nand discourses some records are said to be preserved by his disciples. But\r\nwhatsoever he was himself, this we know for certain concerning him, that\r\nhe left successors renowned for their continence, their love of God, and\r\nobservance of monastic rules. It is true they employed doubtful cycles in\r\nfixing the time of the great festival, as having none to bring them the\r\nsynodal decrees for the observance of Easter, by reason of their being so\r\nfar away from the rest of the world; but they earnestly practised such\r\nworks of piety and chastity as they could learn from the Prophets, the\r\nGospels and the Apostolic writings. This manner of keeping Easter\r\ncontinued among them no little time, to wit, for the space of 150 years,\r\ntill the year of our Lord 715.\r\n\r\nBut then the most reverend and holy father and priest, Egbert,(308) of the\r\nEnglish nation, who had long lived in banishment in Ireland for the sake\r\nof Christ, and was most learned in the Scriptures, and renowned for long\r\nperfection of life, came among them, corrected their error, and led them\r\nto observe the true and canonical day of Easter; which, nevertheless, they\r\ndid not always keep on the fourteenth of the moon with the Jews, as some\r\nimagined, but on Sunday, although not in the proper week.(309) For, as\r\nChristians, they knew that the Resurrection of our Lord, which happened on\r\nthe first day of the week, was always to be celebrated on the first day of\r\nthe week; but being rude and barbarous, they had not learned when that\r\nsame first day after the Sabbath, which is now called the Lord’s day,\r\nshould come. But because they had not failed in the grace of fervent\r\ncharity, they were accounted worthy to receive the full knowledge of this\r\nmatter also, according to the promise of the Apostle, “And if in any thing\r\nye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.”(310) Of\r\nwhich we shall speak more fully hereafter in its proper place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. V. Of the life of Bishop Aidan. [635 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this island, then, and the fraternity of these monks, Aidan was sent\r\nto instruct the English nation in Christ, having received the dignity of a\r\nbishop. At that time Segeni,(311) abbot and priest, presided over that\r\nmonastery. Among other lessons in holy living, Aidan left the clergy a\r\nmost salutary example of abstinence and continence; it was the highest\r\ncommendation of his doctrine with all men, that he taught nothing that he\r\ndid not practise in his life among his brethren; for he neither sought nor\r\nloved anything of this world, but delighted in distributing immediately\r\namong the poor whom he met whatsoever was given him by the kings or rich\r\nmen of the world. He was wont to traverse both town and country on foot,\r\nnever on horseback, unless compelled by some urgent necessity; to the end\r\nthat, as he went, he might turn aside to any whomsoever he saw, whether\r\nrich or poor, and call upon them, if infidels, to receive the mystery of\r\nthe faith, or, if they were believers, strengthen them in the faith, and\r\nstir them up by words and actions to giving of alms and the performance of\r\ngood works.\r\n\r\nHis course of life was so different from the slothfulness of our times,\r\nthat all those who bore him company, whether they were tonsured or laymen,\r\nhad to study either reading the Scriptures, or learning psalms. This was\r\nthe daily employment of himself and all that were with him, wheresoever\r\nthey went; and if it happened, which was but seldom, that he was invited\r\nto the king’s table, he went with one or two clerks, and having taken a\r\nlittle food, made haste to be gone, either to read with his brethren or to\r\npray. At that time, many religious men and women, led by his example,\r\nadopted the custom of prolonging their fast on Wednesdays and Fridays,\r\ntill the ninth hour, throughout the year, except during the fifty days\r\nafter Easter. Never, through fear or respect of persons, did he keep\r\nsilence with regard to the sins of the rich; but was wont to correct them\r\nwith a severe rebuke. He never gave money to the powerful men of the\r\nworld, but only food, if he happened to entertain them; and, on the\r\ncontrary, whatsoever gifts of money he received from the rich, he either\r\ndistributed, as has been said, for the use of the poor, or bestowed in\r\nransoming such as had been wrongfully sold for slaves. Moreover, he\r\nafterwards made many of those he had ransomed his disciples, and after\r\nhaving taught and instructed them, advanced them to priest’s orders.\r\n\r\nIt is said, that when King Oswald had asked a bishop of the Scots to\r\nadminister the Word of faith to him and his nation, there was first sent\r\nto him another man of more harsh disposition,(312) who, after preaching\r\nfor some time to the English and meeting with no success, not being gladly\r\nheard by the people, returned home, and in an assembly of the elders\r\nreported, that he had not been able to do any good by his teaching to the\r\nnation to whom he had been sent, because they were intractable men, and of\r\na stubborn and barbarous disposition. They then, it is said, held a\r\ncouncil and seriously debated what was to be done, being desirous that the\r\nnation should obtain the salvation it demanded, but grieving that they had\r\nnot received the preacher sent to them. Then said Aidan, who was also\r\npresent in the council, to the priest in question, “Methinks, brother,\r\nthat you were more severe to your unlearned hearers than you ought to have\r\nbeen, and did not at first, conformably to the Apostolic rule, give them\r\nthe milk of more easy doctrine, till, being by degrees nourished with the\r\nWord of God, they should be capable of receiving that which is more\r\nperfect and of performing the higher precepts of God.” Having heard these\r\nwords, all present turned their attention to him and began diligently to\r\nweigh what he had said, and they decided that he was worthy to be made a\r\nbishop, and that he was the man who ought to be sent to instruct the\r\nunbelieving and unlearned; since he was found to be endued preeminently\r\nwith the grace of discretion, which is the mother of the virtues. So they\r\nordained him and sent him forth to preach; and, as time went on, his other\r\nvirtues became apparent, as well as that temperate discretion which had\r\nmarked him at first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. VI. Of King Oswald’s wonderful piety and religion. [635-642 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Oswald, with the English nation which he governed, being instructed\r\nby the teaching of this bishop, not only learned to hope for a heavenly\r\nkingdom unknown to his fathers, but also obtained of the one God, Who made\r\nheaven and earth, a greater earthly kingdom than any of his ancestors. In\r\nbrief, he brought under his dominion all the nations and provinces of\r\nBritain, which are divided into four languages, to wit, those of the\r\nBritons, the Picts, the Scots, and the English.(313) Though raised to that\r\nheight of regal power, wonderful to relate, he was always humble, kind,\r\nand generous to the poor and to strangers.\r\n\r\nTo give one instance, it is told, that when he was once sitting at dinner,\r\non the holy day of Easter, with the aforesaid bishop, and a silver dish\r\nfull of royal dainties was set before him, and they were just about to put\r\nforth their hands to bless the bread, the servant, whom he had appointed\r\nto relieve the needy, came in on a sudden, and told the king, that a great\r\nmultitude of poor folk from all parts was sitting in the streets begging\r\nalms of the king; he immediately ordered the meat set before him to be\r\ncarried to the poor, and the dish to be broken in pieces and divided among\r\nthem. At which sight, the bishop who sat by him, greatly rejoicing at such\r\nan act of piety, clasped his right hand and said, “May this hand never\r\ndecay.” This fell out according to his prayer, for his hands with the arms\r\nbeing cut off from his body, when he was slain in battle, remain\r\nuncorrupted to this day, and are kept in a silver shrine, as revered\r\nrelics, in St. Peter’s church in the royal city,(314) which has taken its\r\nname from Bebba, one of its former queens. Through this king’s exertions\r\nthe provinces of the Deiri and the Bernicians, which till then had been at\r\nvariance, were peacefully united and moulded into one people. He was\r\nnephew to King Edwin through his sister Acha; and it was fit that so great\r\na predecessor should have in his own family such an one to succeed him in\r\nhis religion and sovereignty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. VII. How the West Saxons received the Word of God by the preaching\r\nof Birinus; and of his successors, Agilbert and Leutherius. [635-670 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that time, the West Saxons, formerly called Gewissae,(315) in the reign\r\nof Cynegils,(316) received the faith of Christ, through the preaching of\r\nBishop Birinus,(317) who came into Britain by the counsel of Pope\r\nHonorius;(318) having promised in his presence that he would sow the seed\r\nof the holy faith in the farthest inland regions of the English, where no\r\nother teacher had been before him. Hereupon at the bidding of the Pope he\r\nreceived episcopal consecration from Asterius, bishop of Genoa;(319) but\r\non his arrival in Britain, he first came to the nation of the Gewissae,\r\nand finding all in that place confirmed pagans, he thought it better to\r\npreach the Word there, than to proceed further to seek for other hearers\r\nof his preaching.\r\n\r\nNow, as he was spreading the Gospel in the aforesaid province, it happened\r\nthat when the king himself, having received instruction as a catechumen,\r\nwas being baptized together with his people, Oswald, the most holy and\r\nvictorious king of the Northumbrians, being present, received him as he\r\ncame forth from baptism, and by an honourable alliance most acceptable to\r\nGod, first adopted as his son, thus born again and dedicated to God, the\r\nman whose daughter(320) he was about to receive in marriage. The two kings\r\ngave to the bishop the city called Dorcic,(321) there to establish his\r\nepiscopal see; where having built and consecrated churches, and by his\r\npious labours called many to the Lord, he departed to the Lord, and was\r\nburied in the same city; but many years after, when Haedde was\r\nbishop,(322) he was translated thence to the city of Venta,(323) and laid\r\nin the church of the blessed Apostles, Peter and Paul.\r\n\r\nWhen the king died, his son Coinwalch(324) succeeded him on the throne,\r\nbut refused to receive the faith and the mysteries of the heavenly\r\nkingdom; and not long after he lost also the dominion of his earthly\r\nkingdom; for he put away the sister of Penda, king of the Mercians, whom\r\nhe had married, and took another wife; whereupon a war ensuing, he was by\r\nhim deprived of his kingdom, and withdrew to Anna, king of the East\r\nAngles, where he lived three years in banishment, and learned and received\r\nthe true faith; for the king, with whom he lived in his banishment, was a\r\ngood man, and happy in a good and saintly offspring, as we shall show\r\nhereafter.(325)\r\n\r\nBut when Coinwalch was restored to his kingdom, there came into that\r\nprovince out of Ireland, a certain bishop called Agilbert,(326) a native\r\nof Gaul, but who had then lived a long time in Ireland, for the purpose of\r\nreading the Scriptures. He attached himself to the king, and voluntarily\r\nundertook the ministry of preaching. The king, observing his learning and\r\nindustry, desired him to accept an episcopal see there and remain as the\r\nbishop of his people. Agilbert complied with the request, and presided\r\nover that nation as their bishop for many years. At length the king, who\r\nunderstood only the language of the Saxons, weary of his barbarous tongue,\r\nprivately brought into the province another bishop, speaking his own\r\nlanguage, by name Wini,(327) who had also been ordained in Gaul; and\r\ndividing his province into two dioceses, appointed this last his episcopal\r\nsee in the city of Venta, by the Saxons called Wintancaestir.(328)\r\nAgilbert, being highly offended, that the king should do this without\r\nconsulting him, returned into Gaul, and being made bishop of the city of\r\nParis, died there, being old and full of days. Not many years after his\r\ndeparture out of Britain, Wini was also expelled from his bishopric by the\r\nsame king, and took refuge with Wulfhere, king of the Mercians, of whom he\r\npurchased for money the see of the city of London,(329) and remained\r\nbishop thereof till his death. Thus the province of the West Saxons\r\ncontinued no small time without a bishop.\r\n\r\nDuring which time, the aforesaid king of that nation, sustaining\r\nrepeatedly very great losses in his kingdom from his enemies, at length\r\nbethought himself, that as he had been before expelled from the throne for\r\nhis unbelief, he had been restored when he acknowledged the faith of\r\nChrist; and he perceived that his kingdom, being deprived of a bishop, was\r\njustly deprived also of the Divine protection. He, therefore, sent\r\nmessengers into Gaul to Agilbert, with humble apologies entreating him to\r\nreturn to the bishopric of his nation. But he excused himself, and\r\nprotested that he could not go, because he was bound to the bishopric of\r\nhis own city and diocese; notwithstanding, in order to give him some help\r\nin answer to his earnest request, he sent thither in his stead the priest\r\nLeutherius,(330) his nephew, to be ordained as his bishop, if he thought\r\nfit, saying that he thought him worthy of a bishopric. The king and the\r\npeople received him honourably, and asked Theodore, then Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, to consecrate him as their bishop. He was accordingly\r\nconsecrated in the same city, and many years diligently governed the whole\r\nbishopric of the West Saxons by synodical authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. VIII. How Earconbert, King of Kent, ordered the idols to be\r\ndestroyed; and of his daughter Earcongota, and his kinswoman Ethelberg,\r\nvirgins consecrated to God. [640 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 640, Eadbald,(331) king of Kent, departed this\r\nlife, and left his kingdom to his son Earconbert, who governed it most\r\nnobly twenty-four years and some months. He was the first of the English\r\nkings that of his supreme authority commanded the idols throughout his\r\nwhole kingdom to be forsaken and destroyed, and the fast of forty days to\r\nbe observed; and that the same might not be lightly neglected, he\r\nappointed fitting and condign punishments for the offenders. His daughter\r\nEarcongota, as became the offspring of such a parent, was a most virtuous\r\nvirgin, serving God in a monastery in the country of the Franks, built by\r\na most noble abbess, named Fara, at a place called In Brige;(332) for at\r\nthat time but few monasteries had been built in the country of the Angles,\r\nand many were wont, for the sake of monastic life, to repair to the\r\nmonasteries of the Franks or Gauls; and they also sent their daughters\r\nthere to be instructed, and united to their Heavenly Bridegroom,\r\nespecially in the monasteries of Brige, of Cale,(333) and Andilegum.(334)\r\nAmong whom was also Saethryth,(335) daughter of the wife of Anna, king of\r\nthe East Angles, above mentioned; and Ethelberg,(336) the king’s own\r\ndaughter; both of whom, though strangers, were for their virtue made\r\nabbesses of the monastery of Brige. Sexburg,(337) that king’s elder\r\ndaughter, wife to Earconbert, king of Kent, had a daughter called\r\nEarcongota,(338) of whom we are about to speak.\r\n\r\nMany wonderful works and miracles of this virgin, dedicated to God, are to\r\nthis day related by the inhabitants of that place; but for us it shall\r\nsuffice to say something briefly of her departure out of this world to the\r\nheavenly kingdom. The day of her summoning drawing near, she began to\r\nvisit in the monastery the cells of the infirm handmaidens of Christ, and\r\nparticularly those that were of a great age, or most noted for their\r\nvirtuous life, and humbly commending herself to their prayers, she let\r\nthem know that her death was at hand, as she had learnt by revelation,\r\nwhich she said she had received in this manner. She had seen a band of\r\nmen, clothed in white, come into the monastery, and being asked by her\r\nwhat they wanted, and what they did there, they answered, “They had been\r\nsent thither to carry away with them the gold coin that had been brought\r\nthither from Kent.” Towards the close of that same night, as morning began\r\nto dawn, leaving the darkness of this world, she departed to the light of\r\nheaven. Many of the brethren of that monastery who were in other houses,\r\ndeclared they had then plainly heard choirs of singing angels, and, as it\r\nwere, the sound of a multitude entering the monastery. Whereupon going out\r\nimmediately to see what it might be, they beheld a great light coming down\r\nfrom heaven, which bore that holy soul, set loose from the bonds of the\r\nflesh, to the eternal joys of the celestial country. They also tell of\r\nother miracles that were wrought that night in the same monastery by the\r\npower of God; but as we must proceed to other matters, we leave them to be\r\nrelated by those whose concern they are. The body of this venerable virgin\r\nand bride of Christ was buried in the church of the blessed protomartyr,\r\nStephen. It was thought fit, three days after, to take up the stone that\r\ncovered the tomb, and to raise it higher in the same place, and whilst\r\nthey were doing this, so sweet a fragrance rose from below, that it seemed\r\nto all the brethren and sisters there present, as if a store of balsam had\r\nbeen opened.\r\n\r\nHer aunt also, Ethelberg, of whom we have spoken, preserved the glory,\r\nacceptable to God, of perpetual virginity, in a life of great self-denial,\r\nbut the extent of her virtue became more conspicuous after her death.\r\nWhilst she was abbess, she began to build in her monastery a church, in\r\nhonour of all the Apostles, wherein she desired that her body should be\r\nburied; but when that work was advanced half way, she was prevented by\r\ndeath from finishing it, and was buried in the place in the church which\r\nshe had chosen. After her death, the brothers occupied themselves with\r\nother things, and this structure was left untouched for seven years, at\r\nthe expiration whereof they resolved, by reason of the greatness of the\r\nwork, wholly to abandon the building of the church, and to remove the\r\nabbess’s bones thence to some other church that was finished and\r\nconsecrated. On opening her tomb, they found the body as untouched by\r\ndecay as it had been free from the corruption of carnal concupiscence, and\r\nhaving washed it again and clothed it in other garments, they removed it\r\nto the church of the blessed Stephen, the Martyr. And her festival is wont\r\nto be celebrated there with much honour on the 7th of July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. IX. How miracles of healing have been frequently wrought in the\r\nplace where King Oswald was killed; and how, first, a traveller’s horse\r\nwas restored and afterwards a young girl cured of the palsy. [642 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald, the most Christian king of the Northumbrians, reigned nine years,\r\nincluding that year which was held accursed for the barbarous cruelty of\r\nthe king of the Britons and the reckless apostacy of the English kings;\r\nfor, as was said above,(339) it is agreed by the unanimous consent of all,\r\nthat the names and memory of the apostates should be erased from the\r\ncatalogue of the Christian kings, and no year assigned to their reign.\r\nAfter which period, Oswald was killed in a great battle, by the same pagan\r\nnation and pagan king of the Mercians, who had slain his predecessor\r\nEdwin, at a place called in the English tongue Maserfelth,(340) in the\r\nthirty-eighth year of his age, on the fifth day of the month of\r\nAugust.(341)\r\n\r\nHow great his faith was towards God, and how remarkable his devotion, has\r\nbeen made evident by miracles even after his death; for, in the place\r\nwhere he was killed by the pagans, fighting for his country, sick men and\r\ncattle are frequently healed to this day. Whence it came to pass that many\r\ntook up the very dust of the place where his body fell, and putting it\r\ninto water, brought much relief with it to their friends who were sick.\r\nThis custom came so much into use, that the earth being carried away by\r\ndegrees, a hole was made as deep as the height of a man. Nor is it\r\nsurprising that the sick should be healed in the place where he died; for,\r\nwhilst he lived, he never ceased to provide for the poor and the sick, and\r\nto bestow alms on them, and assist them. Many miracles are said to have\r\nbeen wrought in that place, or with the dust carried from it; but we have\r\nthought it sufficient to mention two, which we have heard from our elders.\r\n\r\nIt happened, not long after his death, that a man was travelling on\r\nhorseback near that place, when his horse on a sudden fell sick, stood\r\nstill, hung his head, and foamed at the mouth, and, at length, as his pain\r\nincreased, he fell to the ground; the rider dismounted, and taking off his\r\nsaddle,(342) waited to see whether the beast would recover or die. At\r\nlength, after writhing for a long time in extreme anguish, the horse\r\nhappened in his struggles to come to the very place where the great king\r\ndied. Immediately the pain abated, the beast ceased from his frantic\r\nkicking, and, after the manner of horses, as if resting from his\r\nweariness, he rolled from side to side, and then starting up, perfectly\r\nrecovered, began to graze hungrily on the green herbage. The rider\r\nobserving this, and being an intelligent man, concluded that there must be\r\nsome wonderful sanctity in the place where the horse had been healed, and\r\nhe marked the spot. After which he again mounted his horse, and went on to\r\nthe inn where he intended to stop. On his arrival he found a girl, niece\r\nto the landlord, who had long been sick of the palsy; and when the members\r\nof the household, in his presence, lamented the girl’s grievous calamity,\r\nhe gave them an account of the place where his horse had been cured. In\r\nbrief, she was put into a wagon and carried to the place and laid down\r\nthere. At first she slept awhile, and when she awoke, found herself healed\r\nof her infirmity. Upon which she called for water, washed her face,\r\narranged her hair, put a kerchief on her head, and returned home on foot,\r\nin good health, with those who had brought her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. X. How the dust of that place prevailed against fire. [After 642\r\nA.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, another traveller, a Briton, as is reported, happened\r\nto pass by the same place, where the aforesaid battle was fought.\r\nObserving one particular spot of ground greener and more beautiful than\r\nany other part of the field, he had the wisdom to infer that the cause of\r\nthe unusual greenness in that place must be that some person of greater\r\nholiness than any other in the army had been killed there. He therefore\r\ntook along with him some of the dust of that piece of ground, tying it up\r\nin a linen cloth, supposing, as was indeed the case, that it would be of\r\nuse for curing sick people, and proceeding on his journey, came in the\r\nevening to a certain village, and entered a house where the villagers were\r\nfeasting at supper. Being received by the owners of the house, he sat down\r\nwith them at the entertainment, hanging the cloth, with the dust which he\r\nhad carried in it, on a post in the wall. They sat long at supper and\r\ndrank deep. Now there was a great fire in the middle of the room, and it\r\nhappened that the sparks flew up and caught the roof of the house, which\r\nbeing made of wattles and thatch, was suddenly wrapped in flames; the\r\nguests ran out in panic and confusion, but they were not able to save the\r\nburning house, which was rapidly being destroyed. Wherefore the house was\r\nburnt down, and only that post on which the dust hung in the linen cloth\r\nremained safe and untouched by the fire. When they beheld this miracle,\r\nthey were all amazed, and inquiring into it diligently, learned that the\r\ndust had been taken from the place where the blood of King Oswald had been\r\nshed. These wonderful works being made known and reported abroad, many\r\nbegan daily to resort to that place, and received the blessing of health\r\nfor themselves and their friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XI. How a light from Heaven stood all night over his relics, and how\r\nthose possessed with devils were healed by them. [679-697 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the rest, I think we ought not to pass over in silence the miracles\r\nand signs from Heaven that were shown when King Oswald’s bones were found,\r\nand translated into the church where they are now preserved. This was done\r\nby the zealous care of Osthryth, queen of the Mercians,(343) the daughter\r\nof his brother Oswy, who reigned after him, as shall be said hereafter.\r\n\r\nThere is a famous monastery in the province of Lindsey, called\r\nBeardaneu,(344) which that queen and her husband Ethelred greatly loved\r\nand venerated, conferring upon it many honours. It was here that she was\r\ndesirous to lay the revered bones of her uncle. When the wagon in which\r\nthose bones were carried arrived towards evening at the aforesaid\r\nmonastery, they that were in it were unwilling to admit them, because,\r\nthough they knew him to be a holy man, yet, as he was a native of another\r\nprovince, and had obtained the sovereignty over them, they retained their\r\nancient aversion to him even after his death. Thus it came to pass that\r\nthe relics were left in the open air all that night, with only a large\r\ntent spread over the wagon which contained them. But it was revealed by a\r\nsign from Heaven with how much reverence they ought to be received by all\r\nthe faithful; for all that night, a pillar of light, reaching from the\r\nwagon up to heaven, was visible in almost every part of the province of\r\nLindsey. Hereupon, in the morning, the brethren of that monastery who had\r\nrefused it the day before, began themselves earnestly to pray that those\r\nholy relics, beloved of God, might be laid among them. Accordingly, the\r\nbones, being washed, were put into a shrine which they had made for that\r\npurpose, and placed in the church, with due honour; and that there might\r\nbe a perpetual memorial of the royal character of this holy man, they hung\r\nup over the monument his banner of gold and purple. Then they poured out\r\nthe water in which they had washed the bones, in a corner of the\r\ncemetery.(345) From that time, the very earth which received that holy\r\nwater, had the power of saving grace in casting out devils from the bodies\r\nof persons possessed.\r\n\r\nLastly, when the aforesaid queen afterwards abode some time in that\r\nmonastery, there came to visit her a certain venerable abbess, who is\r\nstill living, called Ethelhild, the sister of the holy men, Ethelwin(346)\r\nand Aldwin, the first of whom was bishop in the province of Lindsey, the\r\nother abbot of the monastery of Peartaneu;(347) not far from which was the\r\nmonastery of Ethelhild. When this lady was come, in a conversation between\r\nher and the queen, the discourse, among other things, turning upon Oswald,\r\nshe said, that she also had that night seen the light over his relics\r\nreaching up to heaven. The queen thereupon added, that the very dust of\r\nthe pavement on which the water that washed the bones had been poured out,\r\nhad already healed many sick persons. The abbess thereupon desired that\r\nsome of that health-bringing dust might be given her, and, receiving it,\r\nshe tied it up in a cloth, and, putting it into a casket, returned home.\r\nSome time after, when she was in her monastery, there came to it a guest,\r\nwho was wont often in the night to be on a sudden grievously tormented\r\nwith an unclean spirit; he being hospitably entertained, when he had gone\r\nto bed after supper, was suddenly seized by the Devil, and began to cry\r\nout, to gnash his teeth, to foam at the mouth, and to writhe and distort\r\nhis limbs. None being able to hold or bind him, the servant ran, and\r\nknocking at the door, told the abbess. She, opening the monastery door,\r\nwent out herself with one of the nuns to the men’s apartment, and calling\r\na priest, desired that he would go with her to the sufferer. Being come\r\nthither, and seeing many present, who had not been able, by their efforts,\r\nto hold the tormented person and restrain his convulsive movements, the\r\npriest used exorcisms, and did all that he could to assuage the madness of\r\nthe unfortunate man, but, though he took much pains, he could not prevail.\r\nWhen no hope appeared of easing him in his ravings, the abbess bethought\r\nherself of the dust, and immediately bade her handmaiden go and fetch her\r\nthe casket in which it was. As soon as she came with it, as she had been\r\nbidden, and was entering the hall of the house, in the inner part whereof\r\nthe possessed person was writhing in torment, he suddenly became silent,\r\nand laid down his head, as if he had been falling asleep, stretching out\r\nall his limbs to rest. “Silence fell upon all and intent they gazed,”(348)\r\nanxiously waiting to see the end of the matter. And after about the space\r\nof an hour the man that had been tormented sat up, and fetching a deep\r\nsigh, said, “Now I am whole, for I am restored to my senses.” They\r\nearnestly inquired how that came to pass, and he answered, “As soon as\r\nthat maiden drew near the hall of this house, with the casket she brought,\r\nall the evil spirits that vexed me departed and left me, and were no more\r\nto be seen.” Then the abbess gave him a little of that dust, and the\r\npriest having prayed, he passed that night in great peace; nor was he,\r\nfrom that time forward, alarmed by night, or in any way troubled by his\r\nold enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XII. How a little boy was cured of a fever at his tomb.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome time after, there was a certain little boy in the said monastery, who\r\nhad been long grievously troubled with a fever; he was one day anxiously\r\nexpecting the hour when his fit was to come on, when one of the brothers,\r\ncoming in to him, said, “Shall I tell you, my son, how you may be cured of\r\nthis sickness? Rise, enter the church, and go close to Oswald’s tomb; sit\r\ndown and stay there quiet and do not leave it; do not come away, or stir\r\nfrom the place, till the time is past, when the fever leaves you: then I\r\nwill go in and fetch you away.” The boy did as he was advised, and the\r\ndisease durst not assail him as he sat by the saint’s tomb; but fled in\r\nsuch fear that it did not dare to touch him, either the second or third\r\nday, or ever after. The brother that came from thence, and told me this,\r\nadded, that at the time when he was talking with me, the young man was\r\nthen still living in the monastery, on whom, when a boy, that miracle of\r\nhealing had been wrought. Nor need we wonder that the prayers of that king\r\nwho is now reigning with our Lord, should be very efficacious with Him,\r\nsince he, whilst yet governing his temporal kingdom, was always wont to\r\npray and labour more for that which is eternal. Nay, it is said, that he\r\noften continued in prayer from the hour of morning thanksgiving(349) till\r\nit was day; and that by reason of his constant custom of praying or giving\r\nthanks to God, he was wont always, wherever he sat, to hold his hands on\r\nhis knees with the palms turned upwards. It is also commonly affirmed and\r\nhas passed into a proverb, that he ended his life in prayer; for when he\r\nwas beset with the weapons of his enemies, and perceived that death was at\r\nhand, he prayed for the souls of his army. Whence it is proverbially said,\r\n“ ‘Lord have mercy on their souls,’ said Oswald, as he fell to the\r\nground.”\r\n\r\nNow his bones were translated to the monastery which we have mentioned,\r\nand buried therein: but the king who slew him commanded his head, and\r\nhands, with the arms, to be cut off from the body, and set upon stakes.\r\nBut his successor in the throne, Oswy, coming thither the next year with\r\nhis army, took them down, and buried his head in the cemetery of the\r\nchurch of Lindisfarne,(350) and the hands and arms in his royal city.(351)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XIII. How a certain person in Ireland was restored, when at the\r\npoint of death, by his relics.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor was the fame of the renowned Oswald confined to Britain, but,\r\nspreading rays of healing light even beyond the sea, reached also to\r\nGermany and Ireland. For the most reverend prelate, Acca,(352) is wont to\r\nrelate, that when, in his journey to Rome,(353) he and his bishop Wilfrid\r\nstayed some time with Wilbrord,(354) the holy archbishop of the Frisians,\r\nhe often heard him tell of the wonders which had been wrought in that\r\nprovince at the relics of that most worshipful king. And he used to say\r\nthat in Ireland, when, being yet only a priest, he led the life of a\r\nstranger and pilgrim for love of the eternal country, the fame of that\r\nking’s sanctity was already spread far and near in that island also. One\r\nof the miracles, among the rest, which he related, we have thought fit to\r\ninsert in this our history.\r\n\r\n“At the time,” said he, “of the plague which made such widespread havoc in\r\nBritain and Ireland, among others, a certain scholar of the Scottish race\r\nwas smitten with the disease, a man learned in the study of letters, but\r\nin no way careful or studious of his eternal salvation; who, seeing his\r\ndeath near at hand, began to fear and tremble lest, as soon as he was\r\ndead, he should be hurried away to the prison-house of Hell for his sins.\r\nHe called me, for I was near, and trembling and sighing in his weakness,\r\nwith a lamentable voice made his complaint to me, after this manner: ‘You\r\nsee that my bodily distress increases, and that I am now reduced to the\r\npoint of death. Nor do I question but that after the death of my body, I\r\nshall be immediately snatched away to the everlasting death of my soul,\r\nand cast into the torments of hell, since for a long time, amidst all my\r\nreading of divine books, I have suffered myself to be ensnared by sin,\r\ninstead of keeping the commandments of God. But it is my resolve, if the\r\nDivine Mercy shall grant me a new term of life, to correct my sinful\r\nhabits, and wholly to devote anew my mind and life to obedience to the\r\nDivine will. But I know that I have no merits of my own whereby to obtain\r\na prolongation of life, nor can I hope to have it, unless it shall please\r\nGod to forgive me, wretched and unworthy of pardon as I am, through the\r\nhelp of those who have faithfully served him. We have heard, and the\r\nreport is widespread, that there was in your nation a king, of wonderful\r\nsanctity, called Oswald, the excellency of whose faith and virtue has been\r\nmade famous even after his death by the working of many miracles. I\r\nbeseech you, if you have any relics of his in your keeping, that you will\r\nbring them to me; if haply the Lord shall be pleased, through his merits,\r\nto have mercy on me.’ I answered, ‘I have indeed a part of the stake on\r\nwhich his head was set up by the pagans, when he was killed, and if you\r\nbelieve with steadfast heart, the Divine mercy may, through the merits of\r\nso great a man, both grant you a longer term of life here, and render you\r\nworthy to be admitted into eternal life.’ He answered immediately that he\r\nhad entire faith therein. Then I blessed some water, and put into it a\r\nsplinter of the aforesaid oak, and gave it to the sick man to drink. He\r\npresently found ease, and, recovering of his sickness, lived a long time\r\nafter; and, being entirely converted to God in heart and deed, wherever he\r\nwent, he spoke of the goodness of his merciful Creator, and the honour of\r\nHis faithful servant.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XIV. How on the death of Paulinus, Ithamar was made bishop of\r\nRochester in his stead; and of the wonderful humility of King Oswin, who\r\nwas cruelly slain by Oswy. [644-651 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald being translated to the heavenly kingdom, his brother Oswy,(355) a\r\nyoung man of about thirty years of age, succeeded him on the throne of his\r\nearthly kingdom, and held it twenty-eight years with much trouble, being\r\nattacked by the pagan nation of the Mercians, that had slain his brother,\r\nas also by his son Alchfrid,(356) and by his nephew Oidilwald,(357) the\r\nson of his brother who reigned before him. In his second year, that is, in\r\nthe year of our Lord 644, the most reverend Father Paulinus, formerly\r\nBishop of York, but at that time Bishop of the city of Rochester, departed\r\nto the Lord, on the 10th day of October, having held the office of a\r\nbishop nineteen years, two months, and twenty-one days; and was buried in\r\nthe sacristy of the blessed Apostle Andrew,(358) which King Ethelbert had\r\nbuilt from the foundation, in the same city of Rochester. In his place,\r\nArchbishop Honorius ordained Ithamar,(359) of the Kentish nation, but not\r\ninferior to his predecessors in learning and conduct of life.\r\n\r\nOswy, during the first part of his reign, had a partner in the royal\r\ndignity called Oswin, of the race of King Edwin, and son to Osric(360) of\r\nwhom we have spoken above, a man of wonderful piety and devotion, who\r\ngoverned the province of the Deiri seven years in very great prosperity,\r\nand was himself beloved by all men. But Oswy, who governed all the other\r\nnorthern part of the nation beyond the Humber, that is, the province of\r\nthe Bernicians, could not live at peace with him; and at last, when the\r\ncauses of their disagreement increased, he murdered him most cruelly. For\r\nwhen each had raised an army against the other, Oswin perceived that he\r\ncould not maintain a war against his enemy who had more auxiliaries than\r\nhimself, and he thought it better at that time to lay aside all thoughts\r\nof engaging, and to reserve himself for better times. He therefore\r\ndisbanded the army which he had assembled, and ordered all his men to\r\nreturn to their own homes, from the place that is called\r\nWilfaraesdun,(361) that is, Wilfar’s Hill, which is about ten miles\r\ndistant from the village called Cataract, towards the north-west. He\r\nhimself, with only one trusty thegn, whose name was Tondhere, withdrew and\r\nlay concealed in the house of Hunwald, a noble,(362) whom he imagined to\r\nbe his most assured friend. But, alas! it was far otherwise; for Hunwald\r\nbetrayed him, and Oswy, by the hands of his reeve, Ethilwin, foully slew\r\nhim and the thegn aforesaid. This happened on the 20th of August, in the\r\nninth year of his reign, at a place called Ingetlingum, where afterwards,\r\nto atone for this crime, a monastery was built,(363) wherein prayers\r\nshould be daily offered up to God for the redemption of the souls of both\r\nkings, to wit, of him that was murdered, and of him that commanded the\r\nmurder.\r\n\r\nKing Oswin was of a goodly countenance, and tall of stature, pleasant in\r\ndiscourse, and courteous in behaviour; and bountiful to all, gentle and\r\nsimple alike; so that he was beloved by all men for the royal dignity of\r\nhis mind and appearance and actions, and men of the highest rank came from\r\nalmost all provinces to serve him. Among all the graces of virtue and\r\nmoderation by which he was distinguished and, if I may say so, blessed in\r\na special manner, humility is said to have been the greatest, which it\r\nwill suffice to prove by one instance.\r\n\r\nHe had given a beautiful horse to Bishop Aidan, to use either in crossing\r\nrivers, or in performing a journey upon any urgent necessity, though the\r\nBishop was wont to travel ordinarily on foot. Some short time after, a\r\npoor man meeting the Bishop, and asking alms, he immediately dismounted,\r\nand ordered the horse, with all his royal trappings, to be given to the\r\nbeggar; for he was very compassionate, a great friend to the poor, and, in\r\na manner, the father of the wretched. This being told to the king, when\r\nthey were going in to dinner, he said to the Bishop, “What did you mean,\r\nmy lord Bishop, by giving the poor man that royal horse, which it was\r\nfitting that you should have for your own use? Had not we many other\r\nhorses of less value, or things of other sorts, which would have been good\r\nenough to give to the poor, instead of giving that horse, which I had\r\nchosen and set apart for your own use?” Thereupon the Bishop answered,\r\n“What do you say, O king? Is that son of a mare more dear to you than that\r\nson of God?” Upon this they went in to dinner, and the Bishop sat in his\r\nplace; but the king, who had come in from hunting, stood warming himself,\r\nwith his attendants, at the fire. Then, on a sudden, whilst he was warming\r\nhimself, calling to mind what the bishop had said to him, he ungirt his\r\nsword, and gave it to a servant, and hastened to the Bishop and fell down\r\nat his feet, beseeching him to forgive him; “For from this time forward,”\r\nsaid he, “I will never speak any more of this, nor will I judge of what or\r\nhow much of our money you shall give to the sons of God.” The bishop was\r\nmuch moved at this sight, and starting up, raised him, saying that he was\r\nentirely reconciled to him, if he would but sit down to his meat, and lay\r\naside all sorrow. The king, at the bishop’s command and request, was\r\ncomforted, but the bishop, on the other hand, grew sad and was moved even\r\nto tears. His priest then asking him, in the language of his country,\r\nwhich the king and his servants did not understand, why he wept, “I know,”\r\nsaid he, “that the king will not live long; for I never before saw a\r\nhumble king; whence I perceive that he will soon be snatched out of this\r\nlife, because this nation is not worthy of such a ruler.” Not long after,\r\nthe bishop’s gloomy foreboding was fulfilled by the king’s sad death, as\r\nhas been said above. But Bishop Aidan himself was also taken out of this\r\nworld, not more than twelve days after the death of the king he loved, on\r\nthe 31st of August,(364) to receive the eternal reward of his labours from\r\nthe Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XV. How Bishop Aidan foretold to certain seamen that a storm would\r\narise, and gave them some holy oil to calm it. [Between 642 and 645 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow great the merits of Aidan were, was made manifest by the Judge of the\r\nheart, with the testimony of miracles, whereof it will suffice to mention\r\nthree, that they may not be forgotten. A certain priest, whose name was\r\nUtta,(365) a man of great weight and sincerity, and on that account\r\nhonoured by all men, even the princes of the world, was sent to Kent, to\r\nbring thence, as wife for King Oswy, Eanfled,(366) the daughter of King\r\nEdwin, who had been carried thither when her father was killed. Intending\r\nto go thither by land, but to return with the maiden by sea, he went to\r\nBishop Aidan, and entreated him to offer up his prayers to the Lord for\r\nhim and his company, who were then to set out on so long a journey. He,\r\nblessing them, and commending them to the Lord, at the same time gave them\r\nsome holy oil, saying, “I know that when you go on board ship, you will\r\nmeet with a storm and contrary wind; but be mindful to cast this oil I\r\ngive you into the sea, and the wind will cease immediately; you will have\r\npleasant calm weather to attend you and send you home by the way that you\r\ndesire.”\r\n\r\nAll these things fell out in order, even as the bishop had foretold. For\r\nfirst, the waves of the sea raged, and the sailors endeavoured to ride it\r\nout at anchor, but all to no purpose; for the sea sweeping over the ship\r\non all sides and beginning to fill it with water, they all perceived that\r\ndeath was at hand and about to overtake them. The priest at last,\r\nremembering the bishop’s words, laid hold of the phial and cast some of\r\nthe oil into the sea, which at once, as had been foretold, ceased from its\r\nuproar. Thus it came to pass that the man of God, by the spirit of\r\nprophecy, foretold the storm that was to come to pass, and by virtue of\r\nthe same spirit, though absent in the body, calmed it when it had arisen.\r\nThe story of this miracle was not told me by a person of little credit,\r\nbut by Cynimund, a most faithful priest of our church,(367) who declared\r\nthat it was related to him by Utta, the priest, in whose case and through\r\nwhom the same was wrought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XVI. How the same Aidan, by his prayers, saved the royal city when\r\nit was fired by the enemy [Before 651 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother notable miracle of the same father is related by many such as were\r\nlikely to have knowledge thereof; for during the time that he was bishop,\r\nthe hostile army of the Mercians, under the command of Penda, cruelly\r\nravaged the country of the Northumbrians far and near, even to the royal\r\ncity,(368) which has its name from Bebba, formerly its queen. Not being\r\nable to take it by storm or by siege, he endeavoured to burn it down; and\r\nhaving pulled down all the villages in the neighbourhood of the city, he\r\nbrought thither an immense quantity of beams, rafters, partitions, wattles\r\nand thatch, wherewith he encompassed the place to a great height on the\r\nland side, and when he found the wind favourable, he set fire to it and\r\nattempted to burn the town.\r\n\r\nAt that time, the most reverend Bishop Aidan was dwelling in the Isle of\r\nFarne,(369) which is about two miles from the city; for thither he was\r\nwont often to retire to pray in solitude and silence; and, indeed, this\r\nlonely dwelling of his is to this day shown in that island. When he saw\r\nthe flames of fire and the smoke carried by the wind rising above the city\r\nwalls, he is said to have lifted up his eyes and hands to heaven, and\r\ncried with tears, “Behold, Lord, how great evil is wrought by Penda!”\r\nThese words were hardly uttered, when the wind immediately veering from\r\nthe city, drove back the flames upon those who had kindled them, so that\r\nsome being hurt, and all afraid, they forebore any further attempts\r\nagainst the city, which they perceived to be protected by the hand of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XVII. How a prop of the church on which Bishop Aidan was leaning\r\nwhen he died, could not be consumed when the rest of the Church was on\r\nfire; and concerning his inward life. [651 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAidan was in the king’s township, not far from the city of which we have\r\nspoken above, at the time when death caused him to quit the body, after he\r\nhad been bishop sixteen(370) years; for having a church and a chamber in\r\nthat place, he was wont often to go and stay there, and to make excursions\r\nfrom it to preach in the country round about, which he likewise did at\r\nother of the king’s townships, having nothing of his own besides his\r\nchurch and a few fields about it. When he was sick they set up a tent for\r\nhim against the wall at the west end of the church, and so it happened\r\nthat he breathed his last, leaning against a buttress that was on the\r\noutside of the church to strengthen the wall. He died in the seventeenth\r\nyear of his episcopate, on the 31st of August.(371) His body was thence\r\npresently translated to the isle of Lindisfarne, and buried in the\r\ncemetery of the brethren. Some time after, when a larger church was built\r\nthere and dedicated in honour of the blessed prince of the Apostles, his\r\nbones were translated thither, and laid on the right side of the altar,\r\nwith the respect due to so great a prelate.\r\n\r\nFinan,(372) who had likewise been sent thither from Hii, the island\r\nmonastery of the Scots, succeeded him, and continued no small time in the\r\nbishopric. It happened some years after, that Penda, king of the Mercians,\r\ncoming into these parts with a hostile army, destroyed all he could with\r\nfire and sword, and the village where the bishop died, along with the\r\nchurch above mentioned, was burnt down; but it fell out in a wonderful\r\nmanner that the buttress against which he had been leaning when he died,\r\ncould not be consumed by the fire which devoured all about it. This\r\nmiracle being noised abroad, the church was soon rebuilt in the same\r\nplace, and that same buttress was set up on the outside, as it had been\r\nbefore, to strengthen the wall. It happened again, some time after, that\r\nthe village and likewise the church were carelessly burned down the second\r\ntime. Then again, the fire could not touch the buttress; and,\r\nmiraculously, though the fire broke through the very holes of the nails\r\nwherewith it was fixed to the building, yet it could do no hurt to the\r\nbuttress itself. When therefore the church was built there the third time,\r\nthey did not, as before, place that buttress on the outside as a support\r\nof the building, but within the church, as a memorial of the miracle;\r\nwhere the people coming in might kneel, and implore the Divine mercy. And\r\nit is well known that since then many have found grace and been healed in\r\nthat same place, as also that by means of splinters cut off from the\r\nbuttress, and put into water, many more have obtained a remedy for their\r\nown infirmities and those of their friends.(373)\r\n\r\nI have written thus much concerning the character and works of the\r\naforesaid Aidan, in no way commending or approving his lack of wisdom with\r\nregard to the observance of Easter; nay, heartily detesting it, as I have\r\nmost manifestly proved in the book I have written, “De Temporibus”;(374)\r\nbut, like an impartial historian, unreservedly relating what was done by\r\nor through him, and commending such things as are praiseworthy in his\r\nactions, and preserving the memory thereof for the benefit of the readers;\r\nto wit, his love of peace and charity; of continence and humility; his\r\nmind superior to anger and avarice, and despising pride and vainglory; his\r\nindustry in keeping and teaching the Divine commandments, his power of\r\nstudy and keeping vigil; his priestly authority in reproving the haughty\r\nand powerful, and at the same time his tenderness in comforting the\r\nafflicted, and relieving or defending the poor. To be brief, so far as I\r\nhave learnt from those that knew him, he took care to neglect none of\r\nthose things which he found in the Gospels and the writings of Apostles\r\nand prophets, but to the utmost of his power endeavoured to fulfil them\r\nall in his deeds.\r\n\r\nThese things I greatly admire and love in the aforesaid bishop, because I\r\ndo not doubt that they were pleasing to God; but I do not approve or\r\npraise his observance of Easter at the wrong time, either through\r\nignorance of the canonical time appointed, or, if he knew it, being\r\nprevailed on by the authority of his nation not to adopt it.(375) Yet this\r\nI approve in him, that in the celebration of his Easter, the object which\r\nhe had at heart and reverenced and preached was the same as ours, to wit,\r\nthe redemption of mankind, through the Passion, Resurrection and Ascension\r\ninto Heaven of the Man Christ Jesus, who is the mediator between God and\r\nman. And therefore he always celebrated Easter, not as some falsely\r\nimagine, on the fourteenth of the moon, like the Jews, on any day of the\r\nweek, but on the Lord’s day, from the fourteenth to the twentieth of the\r\nmoon; and this he did from his belief that the Resurrection of our Lord\r\nhappened on the first day of the week, and for the hope of our\r\nresurrection, which also he, with the holy Church, believed would truly\r\nhappen on that same first day of the week, now called the Lord’s day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XVIII. Of the life and death of the religious King Sigbert. [_Circ._\r\n631 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time, the kingdom of the East Angles, after the death of Earpwald,\r\nthe successor of Redwald, was governed by his brother Sigbert,(376) a good\r\nand religious man, who some time before had been baptized in Gaul, whilst\r\nhe lived in banishment, a fugitive from the enmity of Redwald. When he\r\nreturned home, as soon as he ascended the throne, being desirous to\r\nimitate the good institutions which he had seen in Gaul, he founded a\r\nschool wherein boys should be taught letters, and was assisted therein by\r\nBishop Felix, who came to him from Kent, and who furnished them with\r\nmasters and teachers after the manner of the people of Kent.(377)\r\n\r\nThis king became so great a lover of the heavenly kingdom, that at last,\r\nquitting the affairs of his kingdom, and committing them to his kinsman\r\nEcgric, who before had a share in that kingdom, he entered a monastery,\r\nwhich he had built for himself, and having received the tonsure, applied\r\nhimself rather to do battle for a heavenly throne. A long time after this,\r\nit happened that the nation of the Mercians, under King Penda, made war on\r\nthe East Angles; who finding themselves no match for their enemy,\r\nentreated Sigbert to go with them to battle, to encourage the soldiers. He\r\nwas unwilling and refused, upon which they drew him against his will out\r\nof the monastery, and carried him to the army, hoping that the soldiers\r\nwould be less afraid and less disposed to flee in the presence of one who\r\nhad formerly been an active and distinguished commander. But he, still\r\nmindful of his profession, surrounded, as he was, by a royal army, would\r\ncarry nothing in his hand but a wand, and was killed with King Ecgric; and\r\nthe pagans pressing on, all their army was either slaughtered or\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\nThey were succeeded in the kingdom by Anna,(378) the son of Eni, of the\r\nblood royal, a good man, and the father of good children, of whom, in the\r\nproper place, we shall speak hereafter. He also was afterwards slain like\r\nhis predecessors by the same pagan chief of the Mercians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XIX. How Fursa built a monastery among the East Angles, and of his\r\nvisions and sanctity, to which, his flesh remaining uncorrupted after\r\ndeath bore testimony. [_Circ._ 633 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst Sigbert still governed the kingdom, there came out of Ireland a\r\nholy man called Fursa,(379) renowned both for his words and actions, and\r\nremarkable for singular virtues, being desirous to live as a stranger and\r\npilgrim for the Lord’s sake, wherever an opportunity should offer. On\r\ncoming into the province of the East Angles, he was honourably received by\r\nthe aforesaid king, and performing his wonted task of preaching the\r\nGospel, by the example of his virtue and the influence of his words,\r\nconverted many unbelievers to Christ, and confirmed in the faith and love\r\nof Christ those that already believed.\r\n\r\nHere he fell into some infirmity of body, and was thought worthy to see a\r\nvision of angels; in which he was admonished diligently to persevere in\r\nthe ministry of the Word which he had undertaken, and indefatigably to\r\napply himself to his usual watching and prayers; inasmuch as his end was\r\ncertain, but the hour thereof uncertain, according to the saying of our\r\nLord, “Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour.”(380)\r\nBeing confirmed by this vision, he set himself with all speed to build a\r\nmonastery on the ground which had been given him by King Sigbert, and to\r\nestablish a rule of life therein. This monastery was pleasantly situated\r\nin the woods, near the sea; it was built within the area of a fort, which\r\nin the English language is called Cnobheresburg, that is, Cnobhere’s\r\nTown;(381) afterwards, Anna, king of that province, and certain of the\r\nnobles, embellished it with more stately buildings and with gifts.\r\n\r\nThis man was of noble Scottish(382) blood, but much more noble in mind\r\nthan in birth. From his boyish years, he had earnestly applied himself to\r\nreading sacred books and observing monastic discipline, and, as is most\r\nfitting for holy men, he carefully practised all that he learned to be\r\nright.\r\n\r\nNow, in course of time he himself built a monastery,(383) wherein he might\r\nwith more freedom devote himself to his heavenly studies. There, falling\r\nsick, as the book concerning his life clearly informs us, he fell into a\r\ntrance, and quitting his body from the evening till cockcrow, he was\r\naccounted worthy to behold the sight of the choirs of angels, and to hear\r\ntheir glad songs of praise. He was wont to declare, that among other\r\nthings he distinctly heard this refrain: “The saints shall go from\r\nstrength to strength.”(384) And again, “The God of gods shall be seen in\r\nSion.”(385) Being restored to his body, and again taken from it three days\r\nafter, he not only saw the greater joys of the blessed, but also fierce\r\nconflicts of evil spirits, who by frequent accusations wickedly\r\nendeavoured to obstruct his journey to heaven; but the angels protected\r\nhim, and all their endeavours were in vain. Concerning all these matters,\r\nif any one desires to be more fully informed, to wit, with what subtlety\r\nof deceit the devils recounted both his actions and idle words, and even\r\nhis thoughts, as if they had been written down in a book; and what joyous\r\nor grievous tidings he learned from the holy angels and just men who\r\nappeared to him among the angels; let him read the little book of his life\r\nwhich I have mentioned, and I doubt not that he will thereby reap much\r\nspiritual profit.\r\n\r\nBut there is one thing among the rest, which we have thought it may be\r\nbeneficial to many to insert in this history. When he had been taken up on\r\nhigh, he was bidden by the angels that conducted him to look back upon the\r\nworld. Upon which, casting his eyes downward, he saw, as it were, a dark\r\nvalley in the depths underneath him. He also saw four fires in the air,\r\nnot far distant from each other. Then asking the angels, what fires those\r\nwere, he was told, they were the fires which would kindle and consume the\r\nworld. One of them was of falsehood, when we do not fulfil that which we\r\npromised in Baptism, to renounce the Devil and all his works. The next was\r\nof covetousness, when we prefer the riches of the world to the love of\r\nheavenly things. The third was of discord, when we do not fear to offend\r\nour neighbour even in needless things. The fourth was of ruthlessness when\r\nwe think it a light thing to rob and to defraud the weak. These fires,\r\nincreasing by degrees, extended so as to meet one another, and united in\r\none immense flame. When it drew near, fearing for himself, he said to the\r\nangel, “Lord, behold the fire draws near to me.” The angel answered, “That\r\nwhich you did not kindle will not burn you; for though this appears to be\r\na terrible and great pyre, yet it tries every man according to the merits\r\nof his works; for every man’s concupiscence shall burn in this fire; for\r\nas a man burns in the body through unlawful pleasure, so, when set free\r\nfrom the body, he shall burn by the punishment which he has deserved.”\r\n\r\nThen he saw one of the three angels, who had been his guides throughout\r\nboth visions, go before and divide the flaming fires, whilst the other\r\ntwo, flying about on both sides, defended him from the danger of the fire.\r\nHe also saw devils flying through the fire, raising the flames of war\r\nagainst the just. Then followed accusations of the envious spirits against\r\nhimself, the defence of the good spirits, and a fuller vision of the\r\nheavenly hosts; as also of holy men of his own nation, who, as he had\r\nlearnt, had worthily held the office of priesthood in old times, and who\r\nwere known to fame; from whom he heard many things very salutary to\r\nhimself, and to all others that would listen to them. When they had ended\r\ntheir discourse, and returned to Heaven with the angelic spirits, there\r\nremained with the blessed Fursa, the three angels of whom we have spoken\r\nbefore, and who were to bring him back to the body. And when they\r\napproached the aforesaid great fire, the angel divided the flame, as he\r\nhad done before; but when the man of God came to the passage so opened\r\namidst the flames, the unclean spirits, laying hold of one of those whom\r\nthey were burning in the fire, cast him against him, and, touching his\r\nshoulder and jaw, scorched them. He knew the man, and called to mind that\r\nhe had received his garment when he died. The holy angel, immediately\r\nlaying hold of the man, threw him back into the fire, and the malignant\r\nenemy said, “Do not reject him whom you before received; for as you\r\nreceived the goods of the sinner, so you ought to share in his\r\npunishment.” But the angel withstood him, saying, “He did not receive them\r\nthrough avarice, but in order to save his soul.” The fire ceased, and the\r\nangel, turning to him, said, “That which you kindled burned you; for if\r\nyou had not received the money of this man that died in his sins, his\r\npunishment would not burn you.” And he went on to speak with wholesome\r\ncounsel of what ought to be done for the salvation of such as repented in\r\nthe hour of death.\r\n\r\nBeing afterwards restored to the body, throughout the whole course of his\r\nlife he bore the mark of the fire which he had felt in the spirit, visible\r\nto all men on his shoulder and jaw; and the flesh openly showed, in a\r\nwonderful manner, what the spirit had suffered in secret. He always took\r\ncare, as he had done before, to teach all men the practice of virtue, as\r\nwell by his example, as by preaching. But as for the story of his visions,\r\nhe would only relate them to those who, from desire of repentance,\r\nquestioned him about them. An aged brother of our monastery is still\r\nliving, who is wont to relate that a very truthful and religious man told\r\nhim, that he had seen Fursa himself in the province of the East Angles,\r\nand heard those visions from his lips; adding, that though it was in\r\nsevere winter weather and a hard frost, and the man was sitting in a thin\r\ngarment when he told the story, yet he sweated as if it had been in the\r\nheat of mid-summer, by reason of the great terror or joy of which he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\nTo return to what we were saying before, when, after preaching the Word of\r\nGod many years in Scotland,(386) he could not well endure the disturbance\r\nof the crowds that resorted to him, leaving all that he looked upon as his\r\nown, he departed from his native island, and came with a few brothers\r\nthrough the Britons into the province of the English, and preaching the\r\nWord there, as has been said, built a famous monastery.(387) When this was\r\nduly carried out, he became desirous to rid himself of all business of\r\nthis world, and even of the monastery itself, and forthwith left the care\r\nof it and of its souls, to his brother Fullan, and the priests Gobban and\r\nDicull,(388) and being himself free from all worldly affairs, resolved to\r\nend his life as a hermit. He had another brother called Ultan, who, after\r\na long monastic probation, had also adopted the life of an anchorite. So,\r\nseeking him out alone, he lived a whole year with him in self-denial and\r\nprayer, and laboured daily with his hands.\r\n\r\nAfterwards seeing the province thrown into confusion by the irruptions of\r\nthe pagans,(389) and foreseeing that the monasteries would also be in\r\ndanger, he left all things in order, and sailed over into Gaul, and being\r\nthere honourably entertained by Clovis, king of the Franks,(390) or by the\r\npatrician Ercinwald, he built a monastery in the place called\r\nLatineacum,(391) and falling sick not long after, departed this life. The\r\nsame Ercinwald, the patrician, took his body, and kept it in the porch of\r\na church he was building in his town of Perrona,(392) till the church\r\nitself should be dedicated. This happened twenty-seven days after, and the\r\nbody being taken from the porch, to be re-buried near the altar, was found\r\nas whole as if he had died that very hour. And again, four years after,\r\nwhen a more beautiful shrine had been built to receive his body to the\r\neast of the altar, it was still found without taint of corruption, and was\r\ntranslated thither with due honour; where it is well known that his\r\nmerits, through the divine operation, have been declared by many miracles.\r\nWe have briefly touched upon these matters as well as the incorruption of\r\nhis body, that the lofty nature of the man may be better known to our\r\nreaders.

How, when Honorius died, Deusdedit became Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury; and of those who were at that time bishops of the East Angles,\r\nand of the church of Rochester. [653 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Felix, bishop of the East Angles, dying, when he had held\r\nthat see seventeen years,(393) Honorius ordained Thomas his deacon, of the\r\nprovince of the Gyrwas,(394) in his place; and he being taken from this\r\nlife when he had been bishop five years, Bertgils, surnamed Boniface,(395)\r\nof the province of Kent, was appointed in his stead. Honorius(396) himself\r\nalso, having run his course, departed this life in the year of our Lord\r\n653, on the 30th of September; and when the see had been vacant a year and\r\nsix months, Deusdedit(397) of the nation of the West Saxons, was chosen\r\nthe sixth Archbishop of Canterbury. To ordain him, Ithamar,(398) bishop of\r\nRochester, came thither. His ordination was on the 26th of March, and he\r\nruled the church nine years, four months, and two days; and when Ithamar\r\ndied, he consecrated in his place Damian,(399) who was of the race of the\r\nSouth Saxons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXI. How the province of the Midland Angles became Christian under\r\nKing Peada. [653 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time, the Middle Angles, that is, the Angles of the Midland\r\ncountry,(400) under their Prince Peada, the son of King Penda, received\r\nthe faith and mysteries of the truth. Being an excellent youth, and most\r\nworthy of the name and office of a king, he was by his father elevated to\r\nthe throne of that nation, and came to Oswy, king of the Northumbrians,\r\nrequesting to have his daughter Alchfled(401) given him to wife; but he\r\ncould not obtain his desire unless he would receive the faith of Christ,\r\nand be baptized, with the nation which he governed. When he heard the\r\npreaching of the truth, the promise of the heavenly kingdom, and the hope\r\nof resurrection and future immortality, he declared that he would\r\nwillingly become a Christian, even though he should not obtain the maiden;\r\nbeing chiefly prevailed on to receive the faith by King Oswy’s son\r\nAlchfrid,(402) who was his brother-in-law and friend, for he had married\r\nhis sister Cyneburg,(403) the daughter of King Penda.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he was baptized by Bishop Finan, with all his nobles and\r\nthegns,(404) and their servants, that came along with him, at a noted\r\ntownship, belonging to the king, called At the Wall.(405) And having\r\nreceived four priests, who by reason of their learning and good life were\r\ndeemed proper to instruct and baptize his nation, he returned home with\r\nmuch joy. These priests were Cedd and Adda, and Betti and Diuma;(406) the\r\nlast of whom was by nation a Scot, the others English. Adda was brother to\r\nUtta, whom we have mentioned before,(407) a renowned priest, and abbot of\r\nthe monastery which is called At the Goat’s Head.(408) The aforesaid\r\npriests, arriving in the province with the prince, preached the Word, and\r\nwere heard willingly; and many, as well of the nobility as the common\r\nsort, renouncing the abominations of idolatry, were daily washed in the\r\nfountain of the faith.\r\n\r\nNor did King Penda forbid the preaching of the Word even among his people,\r\nthe Mercians, if any were willing to hear it; but, on the contrary, he\r\nhated and despised those whom he perceived to be without the works of\r\nfaith, when they had once received the faith of Christ, saying, that they\r\nwere contemptible and wretched who scorned to obey their God, in whom they\r\nbelieved. These things were set on foot two years before the death of King\r\nPenda.\r\n\r\nBut when he was slain, and the most Christian king, Oswy, succeeded him in\r\nthe throne, as we shall hereafter relate, Diuma,(409) one of the aforesaid\r\nfour priests, was made bishop of the Midland Angles, as also of the\r\nMercians, being ordained by Bishop Finan; for the scarcity of priests made\r\nit necessary that one prelate should be set over two nations. Having in a\r\nshort time gained many people to the Lord, he died among the Midland\r\nAngles, in the country called Infeppingum;(410) and Ceollach, also of the\r\nScottish nation, succeeded him in the bishopric. But he, not long after,\r\nleft his bishopric, and returned to the island of Hii,(411) which, among\r\nthe Scots, was the chief and head of many monasteries. His successor in\r\nthe bishopric was Trumhere,(412) a godly man, and trained in the monastic\r\nlife, an Englishman, but ordained bishop by the Scots. This happened in\r\nthe days of King Wulfhere, of whom we shall speak hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXII. How under King Sigbert, through the preaching of Cedd, the\r\nEast Saxons again received the faith, which they had before cast off. [653\r\nA.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that time, also, the East Saxons, at the instance of King Oswy, again\r\nreceived the faith, which they had formerly cast off when they expelled\r\nMellitus, their bishop.(413) For Sigbert,(414) who reigned next to Sigbert\r\nsurnamed The Little, was then king of that nation, and a friend to King\r\nOswy, who, when Sigbert came to the province of the Northumbrians to visit\r\nhim, as he often did, used to endeavour to convince him that those could\r\nnot be gods that had been made by the hands of men; that a stock or a\r\nstone could not be proper matter to form a god, the residue whereof was\r\neither burned in the fire, or framed into any vessels for the use of men,\r\nor else was cast out as refuse, trampled on and turned into dust. That God\r\nis rather to be understood as incomprehensible in majesty and invisible to\r\nhuman eyes, almighty, eternal, the Creator of heaven and earth and of\r\nmankind; Who governs and will judge the world in righteousness, Whose\r\neternal abode must be believed to be in Heaven, and not in base and\r\nperishable metal; and that it ought in reason to be concluded, that all\r\nthose who learn and do the will of Him by Whom they were created, will\r\nreceive from Him eternal rewards. King Oswy having often, with friendly\r\ncounsel, like a brother, said this and much more to the like effect to\r\nKing Sigbert, at length, aided by the consent of his friends, he believed,\r\nand after he had consulted with those about him, and exhorted them, when\r\nthey all agreed and assented to the faith, he was baptized with them by\r\nBishop Finan, in the king’s township above spoken of, which is called At\r\nthe Wall,(415) because it is close by the wall which the Romans formerly\r\ndrew across the island of Britain, at the distance of twelve miles from\r\nthe eastern sea.\r\n\r\nKing Sigbert, having now become a citizen of the eternal kingdom, returned\r\nto the seat of his temporal kingdom, requesting of King Oswy that he would\r\ngive him some teachers, to convert his nation to the faith of Christ, and\r\ncleanse them in the fountain of salvation. Wherefore Oswy, sending into\r\nthe province of the Midland Angles, summoned the man of God, Cedd,(416)\r\nand, giving him another priest for his companion, sent them to preach the\r\nWord to the East Saxons. When these two, travelling to all parts of that\r\ncountry, had gathered a numerous Church to the Lord, it happened once that\r\nCedd returned home, and came to the church of Lindisfarne to confer with\r\nBishop Finan; who, finding that the work of the Gospel had prospered in\r\nhis hands, made him bishop of the nation of the East Saxons, calling to\r\nhim two other bishops(417) to assist at the ordination. Cedd, having\r\nreceived the episcopal dignity, returned to his province, and pursuing the\r\nwork he had begun with more ample authority, built churches in divers\r\nplaces, and ordained priests and deacons to assist him in the Word of\r\nfaith, and the ministry of Baptism,(418) especially in the city which, in\r\nthe language of the Saxons, is called Ythancaestir,(419) as also in that\r\nwhich is named Tilaburg.(420) The first of these places is on the bank of\r\nthe Pant, the other on the bank of the Thames. In these, gathering a flock\r\nof Christ’s servants, he taught them to observe the discipline of a rule\r\nof life, as far as those rude people were then capable of receiving it.\r\n\r\nWhilst the teaching of the everlasting life was thus, for no small time,\r\nmaking daily increase in that province to the joy of the king and of all\r\nthe people, it happened that the king, at the instigation of the enemy of\r\nall good men, was murdered by his own kindred. They were two brothers who\r\ndid this wicked deed; and being asked what had moved them to it, they had\r\nnothing else to answer, but that they had been incensed against the king,\r\nand hated him, because he was too apt to spare his enemies, and calmly\r\nforgave the wrongs they had done him, upon their entreaty. Such was the\r\ncrime for which the king was killed, because he observed the precepts of\r\nthe Gospel with a devout heart; but in this innocent death his real\r\noffence was also punished, according to the prediction of the man of God.\r\nFor one of those nobles(421) that murdered him was unlawfully married, and\r\nwhen the bishop was not able to prevent or correct the sin, he\r\nexcommunicated him, and commanded all that would give ear to him not to\r\nenter this man’s house, nor to eat of his meat. But the king made light of\r\nthis command, and being invited by the noble, went to a banquet at his\r\nhouse. As he was going thence, the bishop met him. The king, beholding\r\nhim, immediately dismounted from his horse, trembling, and fell down at\r\nhis feet, begging pardon for his offence; for the bishop, who was likewise\r\non horseback, had also alighted. Being much incensed, he touched the\r\nprostrate king with the rod he held in his hand, and spoke thus with the\r\nauthority of his office: “I tell thee, forasmuch as thou wouldest not\r\nrefrain from the house of that sinful and condemned man, thou shalt die in\r\nthat very house.” Yet it is to be believed, that such a death of a\r\nreligious man not only blotted out his offence, but even added to his\r\nmerit; because it happened on account of his piety and his observance of\r\nthe commands of Christ.\r\n\r\nSigbert was succeeded in the kingdom by Suidhelm,(422) the son of Sexbald,\r\nwho was baptized by the same Cedd, in the province of the East Angles, in\r\nthe royal township, called Rendlaesham,(423) that is, Rendil’s Dwelling;\r\nand Ethelwald,(424) king of the East Angles, brother to Anna, king of the\r\nsame people, received him as he came forth from the holy font.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXIII. How Bishop Cedd, having a place for building a monastery\r\ngiven him by King Ethelwald, consecrated it to the Lord with prayer and\r\nfasting; and concerning his death. [659-664 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same man of God, whilst he was bishop among the East Saxons, was also\r\nwont oftentimes to visit his own province, Northumbria, for the purpose of\r\nexhortation. Oidilwald,(425) the son of King Oswald, who reigned among the\r\nDeiri, finding him a holy, wise, and good man, desired him to accept some\r\nland whereon to build a monastery, to which the king himself might\r\nfrequently resort, to pray to the Lord and hear the Word, and where he\r\nmight be buried when he died; for he believed faithfully that he should\r\nreceive much benefit from the daily prayers of those who were to serve the\r\nLord in that place. The king had before with him a brother of the same\r\nbishop, called Caelin, a man no less devoted to God, who, being a priest,\r\nwas wont to administer to him and his house the Word and the Sacraments of\r\nthe faith; by whose means he chiefly came to know and love the bishop. So\r\nthen, complying with the king’s desires, the Bishop chose himself a place\r\nwhereon to build a monastery among steep and distant mountains, which\r\nlooked more like lurking-places for robbers and dens of wild beasts, than\r\ndwellings of men; to the end that, according to the prophecy of Isaiah,\r\n“In the habitation of dragons, where each lay, might be grass with reeds\r\nand rushes;”(426) that is, that the fruits of good works should spring up,\r\nwhere before beasts were wont to dwell, or men to live after the manner of\r\nbeasts.\r\n\r\nBut the man of God, desiring first to cleanse the place which he had\r\nreceived for the monastery from stain of former crimes, by prayer and\r\nfasting, and so to lay the foundations there, requested of the king that\r\nhe would give him opportunity and leave to abide there for prayer all the\r\ntime of Lent, which was at hand. All which days, except Sundays, he\r\nprolonged his fast till the evening, according to custom, and then took no\r\nother sustenance than a small piece of bread, one hen’s egg, and a little\r\nmilk and water. This, he said, was the custom of those of whom he had\r\nlearned the rule of regular discipline, first to consecrate to the Lord,\r\nby prayer and fasting, the places which they had newly received for\r\nbuilding a monastery or a church. When there were ten days of Lent still\r\nremaining, there came a messenger to call him to the king; and he, that\r\nthe holy work might not be intermitted, on account of the king’s affairs,\r\nentreated his priest, Cynibill, who was also his own brother, to complete\r\nhis pious undertaking. Cynibill readily consented, and when the duty of\r\nfasting and prayer was over, he there built the monastery, which is now\r\ncalled Laestingaeu,(427) and established therein religious customs\r\naccording to the use of Lindisfarne, where he had been trained.\r\n\r\nWhen Cedd had for many years held the office of bishop in the aforesaid\r\nprovince, and also taken charge of this monastery, over which he placed\r\nprovosts,(428) it happened that he came thither at a time when there was\r\nplague, and fell sick and died. He was first buried without the walls; but\r\nin the process of time a church was built of stone in the monastery, in\r\nhonour of the Blessed Mother of God, and his body was laid in it, on the\r\nright side of the altar.\r\n\r\nThe bishop left the monastery to be governed after him by his brother\r\nCeadda,(429) who was afterwards made bishop, as shall be told hereafter.\r\nFor, as it rarely happens, the four brothers we have mentioned, Cedd and\r\nCynibill, and Caelin and Ceadda, were all celebrated priests of the Lord,\r\nand two of them also came to be bishops. When the brethren who were in his\r\nmonastery, in the province of the East Saxons,(430) heard that the bishop\r\nwas dead and buried in the province of the Northumbrians, about thirty men\r\nof that monastery came thither, being desirous either to live near the\r\nbody of their father, if it should please God, or to die and be buried\r\nthere. Being gladly received by their brethren and fellow soldiers in\r\nChrist, all of them died there struck down by the aforesaid pestilence,\r\nexcept one little boy, who is known to have been saved from death by the\r\nprayers of his spiritual father. For being alive long after, and giving\r\nhimself to the reading of Scripture, he was told that he had not been\r\nregenerated by the water of Baptism, and being then cleansed in the laver\r\nof salvation, he was afterwards promoted to the order of priesthood, and\r\nwas of service to many in the church. I do not doubt that he was delivered\r\nat the point of death, as I have said, by the intercession of his father,\r\nto whose body he had come for love of him, that so he might himself avoid\r\neternal death, and by teaching, offer the ministry of life and salvation\r\nto others of the brethren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXIV. How when King Penda was slain, the province of the Mercians\r\nreceived the faith of Christ, and Oswy gave possessions and territories to\r\nGod, for building monasteries, as a thank offering for the victory\r\nobtained. [655 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time, King Oswy was exposed to the cruel and intolerable invasions\r\nof Penda, king of the Mercians, whom we have so often mentioned, and who\r\nhad slain his brother;(431) at length, compelled by his necessity, he\r\npromised to give him countless gifts and royal marks of honour greater\r\nthan can be believed, to purchase peace; provided that he would return\r\nhome, and cease to waste and utterly destroy the provinces of his kingdom.\r\nThe pagan king refused to grant his request, for he had resolved to blot\r\nout and extirpate all his nation, from the highest to the lowest;\r\nwhereupon King Oswy had recourse to the protection of the Divine pity for\r\ndeliverance from his barbarous and pitiless foe, and binding himself by a\r\nvow, said, “If the pagan will not accept our gifts, let us offer them to\r\nHim that will, the Lord our God.” He then vowed, that if he should win the\r\nvictory, he would dedicate his daughter to the Lord in holy virginity, and\r\ngive twelve pieces of land whereon to build monasteries. After this he\r\ngave battle with a very small army: indeed, it is reported that the pagans\r\nhad thirty times the number of men; for they had thirty legions, drawn up\r\nunder most noted commanders.(432) King Oswy and his son Alchfrid met them\r\nwith a very small army, as has been said, but trusting in Christ as their\r\nLeader; his other son, Egfrid,(433) was then kept as a hostage at the\r\ncourt of Queen Cynwise,(434) in the province of the Mercians. King\r\nOswald’s son Oidilwald,(435) who ought to have supported them, was on the\r\nenemy’s side, and led them on to fight against his country and his uncle;\r\nthough, during the battle, he withdrew, and awaited the event in a place\r\nof safety. The engagement began, the pagans were put to flight or killed,\r\nthe thirty royal commanders, who had come to Penda’s assistance, were\r\nalmost all of them slain; among whom was Ethelhere,(436) brother and\r\nsuccessor to Anna, king of the East Angles. He had been the occasion of\r\nthe war, and was now killed, having lost his army and auxiliaries. The\r\nbattle was fought near the river Winwaed,(437) which then, owing to the\r\ngreat rains, was in flood, and had overflowed its banks, so that many more\r\nwere drowned in the flight than destroyed in battle by the sword.\r\n\r\nThen King Oswy, according to the vow he had made to the Lord, returned\r\nthanks to God for the victory granted him, and gave his daughter\r\nElfled,(438) who was scarce a year old, to be consecrated to Him in\r\nperpetual virginity; bestowing also twelve small estates of land, wherein\r\nthe practice of earthly warfare should cease, and place and means should\r\nbe afforded to devout and zealous monks to wage spiritual warfare, and\r\npray for the eternal peace of his nation. Of these estates six were in the\r\nprovince of the Deiri, and the other six in that of the Bernicians. Each\r\nof the estates contained ten families, that is, a hundred and twenty in\r\nall. The aforesaid daughter of King Oswy, who was to be dedicated to God,\r\nentered the monastery called Heruteu,(439) or, “The Island of the Hart,”\r\nat that time ruled by the Abbess Hilda,(440) who, two years after, having\r\nacquired an estate of ten families, at the place called\r\nStreanaeshalch,(441) built a monastery there, in which the aforesaid\r\nking’s daughter was first trained in the monastic life and afterwards\r\nbecame abbess; till, at the age of fifty-nine, the blessed virgin departed\r\nto be united to her Heavenly Bridegroom. In this monastery, she and her\r\nfather, Oswy, her mother, Eanfled, her mother’s father, Edwin,(442) and\r\nmany other noble persons, are buried in the church of the holy Apostle\r\nPeter. King Oswy concluded this war in the district of Loidis, in the\r\nthirteenth year of his reign, on the 15th of November,(443) to the great\r\nbenefit of both nations; for he delivered his own people from the hostile\r\ndepredations of the pagans, and, having made an end of their heathen\r\nchief, converted the Mercians and the adjacent provinces to the grace of\r\nthe Christian faith.\r\n\r\nDiuma was made the first bishop of the Mercians, as also of Lindsey and\r\nthe Midland Angles, as has been said above,(444) and he died and was\r\nburied among the Midland Angles. The second was Ceollach,(445) who, giving\r\nup his episcopal office before his death, returned into Scotland. Both\r\nthese bishops belonged to the nation of the Scots. The third was Trumhere,\r\nan Englishman, but educated and ordained by the Scots. He was abbot of the\r\nmonastery that is called Ingetlingum,(446) and is the place where King\r\nOswin was killed, as has been said above; for Queen Eanfled, his\r\nkinswoman, in expiation of his unjust death, begged of King Oswy that he\r\nwould give Trumhere, the aforesaid servant of God, a place there to build\r\na monastery, because he also was kinsman to the slaughtered king; in which\r\nmonastery continual prayers should be offered up for the eternal welfare\r\nof the kings, both of him that was murdered, and of him that commanded the\r\nmurder. The same King Oswy governed the Mercians, as also the people of\r\nthe other southern provinces, three years after he had slain King Penda;\r\nand he likewise subdued the greater part of the Picts to the dominion of\r\nthe English.\r\n\r\nAt this time he gave to the above-mentioned Peada, son to King Penda,\r\nbecause he was his kinsman, the kingdom of the Southern Mercians,(447)\r\nconsisting, as is said, of 5,000 families, divided by the river Trent from\r\nthe Northern Mercians, whose land contains 7,000 families; but Peada was\r\nfoully slain in the following spring, by the treachery, as is said, of his\r\nwife,(448) during the very time of the Easter festival. Three years after\r\nthe death of King Penda, the Mercian chiefs, Immin, and Eafa, and Eadbert,\r\nrebelled against King Oswy, setting up for their king, Wulfhere,(449) son\r\nto the said Penda, a youth whom they had kept concealed; and expelling the\r\nealdormen of the foreign king, they bravely recovered at once their\r\nliberty and their lands; and being thus free, together with their king,\r\nthey rejoiced to serve Christ the true King, for the sake of an\r\neverlasting kingdom in heaven. This king governed the Mercians seventeen\r\nyears, and had for his first bishop Trumhere,(450) above spoken of; the\r\nsecond was Jaruman;(451) the third Ceadda;(452) the fourth Wynfrid.(453)\r\nAll these, succeeding each other in order under King Wulfhere, discharged\r\nepiscopal duties to the Mercian nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXV. How the question arose about the due time of keeping Easter,\r\nwith those that came out of Scotland.(454) [664 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Bishop Aidan being taken away from this life, Finan, who\r\nwas ordained and sent by the Scots, succeeded him in the bishopric, and\r\nbuilt a church in the Isle of Lindisfarne, fit for the episcopal see;\r\nnevertheless, after the manner of the Scots, he made it, not of stone, but\r\nentirely of hewn oak, and covered it with reeds; and it was afterwards\r\ndedicated in honour of the blessed Peter the Apostle, by the most reverend\r\nArchbishop Theodore. Eadbert,(455) also bishop of that place, took off the\r\nthatch, and caused it to be covered entirely, both roof and walls, with\r\nplates of lead.\r\n\r\nAt this time, a great and frequently debated question arose about the\r\nobservance of Easter;(456) those that came from Kent or Gaul affirming,\r\nthat the Scots celebrated Easter Sunday contrary to the custom of the\r\nuniversal Church. Among them was a most zealous defender of the true\r\nEaster, whose name was Ronan,(457) a Scot by nation, but instructed in the\r\nrule of ecclesiastical truth in Gaul or Italy. Disputing with Finan, he\r\nconvinced many, or at least induced them to make a more strict inquiry\r\nafter the truth; yet he could not prevail upon Finan, but, on the\r\ncontrary, embittered him the more by reproof, and made him a professed\r\nopponent of the truth, for he was of a violent temper. James,(458)\r\nformerly the deacon of the venerable Archbishop Paulinus, as has been said\r\nabove, observed the true and Catholic Easter, with all those that he could\r\ninstruct in the better way. Queen Eanfled and her followers also observed\r\nit as she had seen it practised in Kent, having with her a Kentish priest\r\nwho followed the Catholic observance, whose name was Romanus. Thus it is\r\nsaid to have sometimes happened in those times that Easter was twice\r\ncelebrated in one year; and that when the king, having ended his fast, was\r\nkeeping Easter, the queen and her followers were still fasting, and\r\ncelebrating Palm Sunday. Whilst Aidan lived, this difference about the\r\nobservance of Easter was patiently tolerated by all men, for they well\r\nknew, that though he could not keep Easter contrary to the custom of those\r\nwho had sent him, yet he industriously laboured to practise the works of\r\nfaith, piety, and love, according to the custom of all holy men; for which\r\nreason he was deservedly beloved by all, even by those who differed in\r\nopinion concerning Easter, and was held in veneration, not only by less\r\nimportant persons, but even by the bishops, Honorius of Canterbury, and\r\nFelix of the East Angles.\r\n\r\nBut after the death of Finan, who succeeded him, when Colman, who was also\r\nsent from Scotland,(459) came to be bishop, a greater controversy arose\r\nabout the observance of Easter, and other rules of ecclesiastical life.\r\nWhereupon this question began naturally to influence the thoughts and\r\nhearts of many who feared, lest haply, having received the name of\r\nChristians, they might run, or have run, in vain. This reached the ears of\r\nthe rulers, King Oswy and his son Alchfrid. Now Oswy, having been\r\ninstructed and baptized by the Scots, and being very perfectly skilled in\r\ntheir language, thought nothing better than what they taught; but\r\nAlchfrid, having for his teacher in Christianity the learned Wilfrid,(460)\r\nwho had formerly gone to Rome to study ecclesiastical doctrine, and spent\r\nmuch time at Lyons with Dalfinus,(461) archbishop of Gaul, from whom also\r\nhe had received the crown of ecclesiastical tonsure, rightly thought that\r\nthis man’s doctrine ought to be preferred before all the traditions of the\r\nScots. For this reason he had also given him a monastery of forty\r\nfamilies, at a place called Inhrypum;(462) which place, not long before,\r\nhe had given for a monastery to those that were followers of the Scots;\r\nbut forasmuch as they afterwards, being left to their choice, preferred to\r\nquit the place rather than alter their custom, he gave it to him, whose\r\nlife and doctrine were worthy of it.\r\n\r\nAgilbert, bishop of the West Saxons,(463) above-mentioned, a friend of\r\nKing Alchfrid and of Abbot Wilfrid, had at that time come into the\r\nprovince of the Northumbrians, and was staying some time among them; at\r\nthe request of Alchfrid, he made Wilfrid a priest in his aforesaid\r\nmonastery. He had in his company a priest, whose name was Agatho.(464) The\r\nquestion being raised there concerning Easter and the tonsure and other\r\necclesiastical matters, it was arranged, that a synod should be held in\r\nthe monastery of Streanaeshalch,(465) which signifies the Bay of the\r\nLighthouse, where the Abbess Hilda,(466) a woman devoted to the service of\r\nGod, then ruled; and that there this question should be decided. The\r\nkings, both father and son, came thither, and the bishops, Colman with his\r\nScottish clerks, and Agilbert with the priests Agatho and Wilfrid. James\r\nand Romanus were on their side; but the Abbess Hilda and her followers\r\nwere for the Scots, as was also the venerable Bishop Cedd,(467) long\r\nbefore ordained by the Scots, as has been said above, and he acted in that\r\ncouncil as a most careful interpreter for both parties.\r\n\r\nKing Oswy first made an opening speech, in which he said that it behoved\r\nthose who served one God to observe one rule of life; and as they all\r\nexpected the same kingdom in heaven, so they ought not to differ in the\r\ncelebration of the heavenly mysteries; but rather to inquire which was the\r\ntruer tradition, that it might be followed by all in common; he then\r\ncommanded his bishop, Colman, first to declare what the custom was which\r\nhe observed, and whence it derived its origin. Then Colman said, “The\r\nEaster which I keep, I received from my elders, who sent me hither as\r\nbishop; all our forefathers, men beloved of God, are known to have\r\ncelebrated it after the same manner; and that it may not seem to any\r\ncontemptible and worthy to be rejected, it is the same which the blessed\r\nJohn the Evangelist, the disciple specially beloved of our Lord, with all\r\nthe churches over which he presided, is recorded to have celebrated.”(468)\r\nWhen he had said thus much, and more to the like effect, the king\r\ncommanded Agilbert to make known the manner of his observance and to show\r\nwhence it was derived, and on what authority he followed it. Agilbert\r\nanswered, “I beseech you, let my disciple, the priest Wilfrid, speak in my\r\nstead; because we both concur with the other followers of the\r\necclesiastical tradition that are here present, and he can better and more\r\nclearly explain our opinion in the English language, than I can by an\r\ninterpreter.”\r\n\r\nThen Wilfrid, being ordered by the king to speak, began thus:—“The Easter\r\nwhich we keep, we saw celebrated by all at Rome, where the blessed\r\nApostles, Peter and Paul, lived, taught, suffered, and were buried; we saw\r\nthe same done by all in Italy and in Gaul, when we travelled through those\r\ncountries for the purpose of study and prayer. We found it observed in\r\nAfrica, Asia, Egypt, Greece, and all the world, wherever the Church of\r\nChrist is spread abroad, among divers nations and tongues, at one and the\r\nsame time; save only among these and their accomplices in obstinacy, I\r\nmean the Picts and the Britons, who foolishly, in these two remote islands\r\nof the ocean, and only in part even of them, strive to oppose all the rest\r\nof the world.” When he had so said, Colman answered, “It is strange that\r\nyou choose to call our efforts foolish, wherein we follow the example of\r\nso great an Apostle, who was thought worthy to lean on our Lord’s bosom,\r\nwhen all the world knows him to have lived most wisely.” Wilfrid replied,\r\n“Far be it from us to charge John with folly, for he literally observed\r\nthe precepts of the Mosaic Law, whilst the Church was still Jewish in many\r\npoints, and the Apostles, lest they should give cause of offence to the\r\nJews who were among the Gentiles, were not able at once to cast off all\r\nthe observances of the Law which had been instituted by God, in the same\r\nway as it is necessary that all who come to the faith should forsake the\r\nidols which were invented by devils. For this reason it was, that Paul\r\ncircumcised Timothy,(469) that he offered sacrifice in the temple,(470)\r\nthat he shaved his head with Aquila and Priscilla at Corinth;(471) for no\r\nother advantage than to avoid giving offence to the Jews. Hence it was,\r\nthat James said to the same Paul, ‘Thou seest, brother, how many thousands\r\nof Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the\r\nLaw.’(472) And yet, at this time, when the light of the Gospel is\r\nspreading throughout the world, it is needless, nay, it is not lawful, for\r\nthe faithful either to be circumcised, or to offer up to God sacrifices of\r\nflesh. So John, according to the custom of the Law, began the celebration\r\nof the feast of Easter, on the fourteenth day of the first month, in the\r\nevening, not regarding whether the same happened on a Saturday, or any\r\nother week-day. But when Peter preached at Rome, being mindful that our\r\nLord arose from the dead, and gave to the world the hope of resurrection,\r\non the first day of the week, he perceived that Easter ought to be kept\r\nafter this manner: he always awaited the rising of the moon on the\r\nfourteenth day of the first month in the evening, according to the custom\r\nand precepts of the Law, even as John did. And when that came, if the\r\nLord’s day, then called the first day of the week, was the next day, he\r\nbegan that very evening to celebrate Easter, as we all do at the present\r\ntime. But if the Lord’s day did not fall the next morning after the\r\nfourteenth moon, but on the sixteenth, or the seventeenth, or any other\r\nmoon till the twenty-first, he waited for that, and on the Saturday\r\nbefore, in the evening, began to observe the holy solemnity of Easter.\r\nThus it came to pass, that Easter Sunday was only kept from the fifteenth\r\nmoon to the twenty-first. Nor does this evangelical and apostolic\r\ntradition abolish the Law, but rather fulfil it; the command being to keep\r\nthe passover from the fourteenth moon of the first month in the evening to\r\nthe twenty-first moon of the same month in the evening; which observance\r\nall the successors of the blessed John in Asia, since his death, and all\r\nthe Church throughout the world, have since followed; and that this is the\r\ntrue Easter, and the only one to be celebrated by the faithful, was not\r\nnewly decreed by the council of Nicaea, but only confirmed afresh; as the\r\nhistory of the Church informs us.(473)\r\n\r\n“Thus it is plain, that you, Colman, neither follow the example of John,\r\nas you imagine, nor that of Peter, whose tradition you oppose with full\r\nknowledge, and that you neither agree with the Law nor the Gospel in the\r\nkeeping of your Easter. For John, keeping the Paschal time according to\r\nthe decree of the Mosaic Law, had no regard to the first day of the week,\r\nwhich you do not practise, seeing that you celebrate Easter only on the\r\nfirst day after the Sabbath. Peter celebrated Easter Sunday between the\r\nfifteenth and the twenty-first moon, which you do not practise, seeing\r\nthat you observe Easter Sunday from the fourteenth to the twentieth moon;\r\nso that you often begin Easter on the thirteenth moon in the evening,\r\nwhereof neither the Law made any mention, nor did our Lord, the Author and\r\nGiver of the Gospel, on that day either eat the old passover in the\r\nevening, or deliver the Sacraments of the New Testament, to be celebrated\r\nby the Church, in memory of His Passion, but on the fourteenth. Besides,\r\nin your celebration of Easter, you utterly exclude the twenty-first moon,\r\nwhich the Law ordered to be specially observed. Thus, as I have said\r\nbefore, you agree neither with John nor Peter, nor with the Law, nor the\r\nGospel, in the celebration of the greatest festival.”\r\n\r\nTo this Colman rejoined: “Did the holy Anatolius,(474) much commended in\r\nthe history of the Church, judge contrary to the Law and the Gospel, when\r\nhe wrote, that Easter was to be celebrated from the fourteenth to the\r\ntwentieth moon? Is it to be believed that our most reverend Father Columba\r\nand his successors, men beloved by God, who kept Easter after the same\r\nmanner, judged or acted contrary to the Divine writings? Whereas there\r\nwere many among them, whose sanctity was attested by heavenly signs and\r\nmiracles which they wrought; whom I, for my part, doubt not to be saints,\r\nand whose life, customs, and discipline I never cease to follow.”\r\n\r\n“It is evident,” said Wilfrid, “that Anatolius was a most holy, learned,\r\nand commendable man; but what have you to do with him, since you do not\r\nobserve his decrees? For he undoubtedly, following the rule of truth in\r\nhis Easter, appointed a cycle of nineteen years, which either you are\r\nignorant of, or if you know it, though it is kept by the whole Church of\r\nChrist, yet you despise it as a thing of naught. He so computed the\r\nfourteenth moon in our Lord’s Paschal Feast, that according to the custom\r\nof the Egyptians, he acknowledged it to be the fifteenth moon on that same\r\nday in the evening; so in like manner he assigned the twentieth to\r\nEaster-Sunday, as believing that to be the twenty-first moon, when the sun\r\nhad set. That you are ignorant of the rule of this distinction is proved\r\nby this, that you sometimes manifestly keep Easter before the full moon,\r\nthat is, on the thirteenth day. Concerning your Father Columba and his\r\nfollowers, whose sanctity you say you imitate, and whose rule and precepts\r\nconfirmed by signs from Heaven you say that you follow, I might answer,\r\nthen when many, in the day of judgement, shall say to our Lord, that in\r\nHis name they have prophesied, and have cast out devils, and done many\r\nwonderful works, our Lord will reply, that He never knew them. But far be\r\nit from me to speak thus of your fathers, for it is much more just to\r\nbelieve good than evil of those whom we know not. Wherefore I do not deny\r\nthose also to have been God’s servants, and beloved of God, who with rude\r\nsimplicity, but pious intentions, have themselves loved Him. Nor do I\r\nthink that such observance of Easter did them much harm, as long as none\r\ncame to show them a more perfect rule to follow; for assuredly I believe\r\nthat, if any teacher, reckoning after the Catholic manner, had come among\r\nthem, they would have as readily followed his admonitions, as they are\r\nknown to have kept those commandments of God, which they had learned and\r\nknew.\r\n\r\n“But as for you and your companions, you certainly sin, if, having heard\r\nthe decrees of the Apostolic see, nay, of the universal Church, confirmed,\r\nas they are, by Holy Scripture, you scorn to follow them; for, though your\r\nfathers were holy, do you think that those few men, in a corner of the\r\nremotest island, are to be preferred before the universal Church of Christ\r\nthroughout the world? And if that Columba of yours, (and, I may say, ours\r\nalso, if he was Christ’s servant,) was a holy man and powerful in\r\nmiracles, yet could he be preferred before the most blessed chief of the\r\nApostles, to whom our Lord said, ‘Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I\r\nwill build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it,\r\nand I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of Heaven?’ ”(475)\r\n\r\nWhen Wilfrid had ended thus, the king said, “Is it true, Colman, that\r\nthese words were spoken to Peter by our Lord?” He answered, “It is true, O\r\nking!” Then said he, “Can you show any such power given to your Columba?”\r\nColman answered, “None.” Then again the king asked, “Do you both agree in\r\nthis, without any controversy, that these words were said above all to\r\nPeter, and that the keys of the kingdom of Heaven were given to him by our\r\nLord?” They both answered, “Yes.” Then the king concluded, “And I also say\r\nunto you, that he is the door-keeper, and I will not gainsay him, but I\r\ndesire, as far as I know and am able, in all things to obey his laws, lest\r\nhaply when I come to the gates of the kingdom of Heaven, there should be\r\nnone to open them, he being my adversary who is proved to have the keys.”\r\nThe king having said this, all who were seated there or standing by, both\r\ngreat and small, gave their assent, and renouncing the less perfect\r\ncustom, hastened to conform to that which they had found to be better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXVI. How Colman, being worsted, returned home; and Tuda succeeded\r\nhim in the bishopric; and of the state of the church under those teachers.\r\n[664 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe disputation being ended, and the assembly broken up, Agilbert returned\r\nhome. Colman, perceiving that his doctrine was rejected, and his party\r\ndespised, took with him those who wished to follow him, to wit, such as\r\nwould not accept the Catholic Easter and the tonsure in the form of a\r\ncrown,(476) (for there was no small dispute about that also,) and went\r\nback into Scotland,(477) to consult with his people what was to be done in\r\nthis case. Cedd, forsaking the practices of the Scots, returned to his\r\nbishopric, having submitted to the Catholic observance of Easter. This\r\ndebate took place in the year of our Lord 664, which was the twenty-second\r\nyear of the reign of King Oswy, and the thirtieth of the episcopate of the\r\nScots among the English; for Aidan was bishop seventeen years, Finan ten,\r\nand Colman three.\r\n\r\nWhen Colman had gone back into his own country, Tuda, the servant of\r\nChrist, was made bishop of the Northumbrians(478) in his place, having\r\nbeen instructed and ordained bishop among the Southern Scots, having also\r\nthe crown of the ecclesiastical tonsure, according to the custom of that\r\nprovince, and observing the Catholic rule with regard to the time of\r\nEaster.(479) He was a good and religious man, but he governed the church a\r\nvery short time; he had come from Scotland(480) whilst Colman was yet\r\nbishop, and, both by word and deed, diligently taught all men those things\r\nthat appertain to the faith and truth. But Eata,(481) who was abbot of the\r\nmonastery called Mailros,(482) a man most reverend and gentle, was\r\nappointed abbot over the brethren that chose to remain in the church of\r\nLindisfarne, when the Scots went away. It is said that Colman, upon his\r\ndeparture, requested and obtained this of King Oswy, because Eata was one\r\nof Aidan’s twelve boys of the English nation,(483) whom he received in the\r\nearly years of his episcopate, to be instructed in Christ; for the king\r\ngreatly loved Bishop Colman on account of his innate discretion. This is\r\nthat Eata, who, not long after, was made bishop of the same church of\r\nLindisfarne. Colman carried home with him part of the bones of the most\r\nreverend Father Aidan, and left part of them in the church where he had\r\npresided, ordering them to be interred in the sacristy.\r\n\r\nThe place which they governed shows how frugal and temperate he and his\r\npredecessors were, for there were very few houses besides the church found\r\nat their departure; indeed, no more than were barely sufficient to make\r\ncivilized life possible; they had also no money, but only cattle; for if\r\nthey received any money from rich persons, they immediately gave it to the\r\npoor; there being no need to gather money, or provide houses for the\r\nentertainment of the great men of the world; for such never resorted to\r\nthe church, except to pray and hear the Word of God. The king himself,\r\nwhen occasion required, came only with five or six servants, and having\r\nperformed his devotions in the church, departed. But if they happened to\r\ntake a repast there, they were satisfied with the plain, daily food of the\r\nbrethren, and required no more. For the whole care of those teachers was\r\nto serve God, not the world—to feed the soul, and not the belly.\r\n\r\nFor this reason the religious habit was at that time held in great\r\nveneration; so that wheresoever any clerk or monk went, he was joyfully\r\nreceived by all men, as God’s servant; and even if they chanced to meet\r\nhim upon the way, they ran to him, and with bowed head, were glad to be\r\nsigned with the cross by his hand, or blessed by his lips. Great attention\r\nwas also paid to their exhortations; and on Sundays they flocked eagerly\r\nto the church, or the monasteries, not to feed their bodies, but to hear\r\nthe Word of God; and if any priest happened to come into a village, the\r\ninhabitants came together and asked of him the Word of life; for the\r\npriests and clerks went to the villages for no other reason than to\r\npreach, baptize, visit the sick, and, in a word, to take care of souls;\r\nand they were so purified from all taint of avarice, that none of them\r\nreceived lands and possessions for building monasteries, unless they were\r\ncompelled to do so by the temporal authorities; which custom was for some\r\ntime after universally observed in the churches of the Northumbrians. But\r\nenough has now been said on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXVII. How Egbert, a holy man of the English nation, led a monastic\r\nlife in Ireland. [664 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same year of our Lord 664, there happened an eclipse of the sun, on\r\nthe third day of May,(484) about the tenth hour of the day. In the same\r\nyear, a sudden pestilence(485) depopulated first the southern parts of\r\nBritain, and afterwards attacking the province of the Northumbrians,\r\nravaged the country far and near, and destroyed a great multitude of men.\r\nBy this plague the aforesaid priest of the Lord, Tuda,(486) was carried\r\noff, and was honourably buried in the monastery called Paegnalaech.(487)\r\nMoreover, this plague prevailed no less disastrously in the island of\r\nIreland. Many of the nobility, and of the lower ranks of the English\r\nnation, were there at that time, who, in the days of the Bishops Finan and\r\nColman, forsaking their native island, retired thither, either for the\r\nsake of sacred studies, or of a more ascetic life; and some of them\r\npresently devoted themselves faithfully to a monastic life, others chose\r\nrather to apply themselves to study, going about from one master’s cell to\r\nanother. The Scots willingly received them all, and took care to supply\r\nthem with daily food without cost, as also to furnish them with books for\r\ntheir studies, and teaching free of charge.\r\n\r\nAmong these were Ethelhun and Egbert,(488) two youths of great capacity,\r\nof the English nobility. The former of whom was brother to Ethelwin,(489)\r\na man no less beloved by God, who also at a later time went over into\r\nIreland to study, and having been well instructed, returned into his own\r\ncountry, and being made bishop in the province of Lindsey, long and nobly\r\ngoverned the Church. These two being in the monastery which in the\r\nlanguage of the Scots is called Rathmelsigi,(490) and having lost all\r\ntheir companions, who were either cut off by the plague, or dispersed into\r\nother places, were both seized by the same sickness, and grievously\r\nafflicted. Of these, Egbert, (as I was informed by a priest venerable for\r\nhis age, and of great veracity, who declared he had heard the story from\r\nhis own lips,) concluding that he was at the point of death, went out of\r\nthe chamber, where the sick lay, in the morning, and sitting alone in a\r\nfitting place, began seriously to reflect upon his past actions, and,\r\nbeing full of compunction at the remembrance of his sins, bedewed his face\r\nwith tears, and prayed fervently to God that he might not die yet, before\r\nhe could forthwith more fully make amends for the careless offences which\r\nhe had committed in his boyhood and infancy, or might further exercise\r\nhimself in good works. He also made a vow that he would spend all his life\r\nabroad and never return into the island of Britain, where he was born;\r\nthat besides singing the psalms at the canonical hours, he would, unless\r\nprevented by bodily infirmity, repeat the whole Psalter daily to the\r\npraise of God; and that he would every week fast one whole day and night.\r\nReturning home, after his tears and prayers and vows, he found his\r\ncompanion asleep; and going to bed himself, he began to compose himself to\r\nrest. When he had lain quiet awhile, his comrade awaking, looked on him,\r\nand said, “Alas! Brother Egbert, what have you done? I was in hopes that\r\nwe should have entered together into life everlasting; but know that your\r\nprayer is granted.” For he had learned in a vision what the other had\r\nrequested, and that he had obtained his request.\r\n\r\nIn brief, Ethelhun died the next night; but Egbert, throwing off his\r\nsickness, recovered and lived a long time after to grace the episcopal\r\noffice, which he received, by deeds worthy of it;(491) and blessed with\r\nmany virtues, according to his desire, lately, in the year of our Lord\r\n729, being ninety years of age, he departed to the heavenly kingdom. He\r\npassed his life in great perfection of humility, gentleness, continence,\r\nsimplicity, and justice. Thus he was a great benefactor, both to his own\r\npeople, and to those nations of the Scots and Picts among whom he lived in\r\nexile, by the example of his life, his earnestness in teaching, his\r\nauthority in reproving, and his piety in giving away of those things which\r\nhe received from the rich. He also added this to the vows which we have\r\nmentioned: during Lent, he would eat but one meal a day, allowing himself\r\nnothing but bread and thin milk, and even that by measure. The milk, new\r\nthe day before, he kept in a vessel, and skimming off the cream in the\r\nmorning, drank the rest, as has been said, with a little bread. Which sort\r\nof abstinence he likewise always observed forty days before the Nativity\r\nof our Lord, and as many after the solemnity of Pentecost, that is, of the\r\nfifty days’ festival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXVIII. How, when Tuda was dead, Wilfrid was ordained, in Gaul, and\r\nCeadda, among the West Saxons, to be bishops for the province of the\r\nNorthumbrians. [664 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, King Alchfrid sent the priest, Wilfrid, to the king of\r\nGaul,(492) in order that he should cause him to be consecrated bishop for\r\nhimself and his people. That prince sent him to be ordained by\r\nAgilbert,(493) of whom we have before spoken, and who, having left\r\nBritain, was made bishop of the city of Paris;(494) and by him Wilfrid was\r\nhonourably consecrated, several bishops meeting together for that purpose\r\nin a village belonging to the king, called In Compendio.(495) He stayed\r\nsome time in the parts beyond the sea for his ordination, and King Oswy,\r\nfollowing the example of his son’s zeal, sent into Kent a holy man, of\r\nmodest character, well read in the Scripture, and diligently practising\r\nthose things which he had learned therein, to be ordained bishop of the\r\nchurch of York. This was a priest called Ceadda,(496) brother to the most\r\nreverend prelate Cedd, of whom mention has been often made, and abbot of\r\nthe monastery of Laestingaeu. With him the king also sent his priest\r\nEadhaed,(497) who was afterwards, in the reign of Egfrid,(498) made bishop\r\nof the church of Ripon. Now when they arrived in Kent, they found that\r\nArchbishop Deusdedit had departed this life, and no other bishop was as\r\nyet appointed in his place; whereupon they betook themselves to the\r\nprovince of the West Saxons, where Wini was bishop, and by him Ceadda was\r\nconsecrated; two bishops of the British nation, who kept Easter Sunday, as\r\nhas been often said, contrary to the canonical manner, from the fourteenth\r\nto the twentieth moon, being called in to assist at the ordination; for at\r\nthat time there was no other bishop in all Britain canonically ordained,\r\nexcept Wini.(499)\r\n\r\nSo Ceadda, being consecrated bishop, began immediately to labour for\r\necclesiastical truth and purity of doctrine; to apply himself to humility,\r\nself-denial, and study; to travel about, not on horseback, but after the\r\nmanner of the Apostles, on foot, to preach the Gospel in towns, the open\r\ncountry, cottages, villages, and castles; for he was one of the disciples\r\nof Aidan, and endeavoured to instruct his people by the same manner of\r\nlife and character, after his and his own brother Cedd’s example. Wilfrid\r\nalso having been now made a bishop, came into Britain, and in like manner\r\nby his teaching brought into the English Church many rules of Catholic\r\nobservance. Whence it followed, that the Catholic principles daily gained\r\nstrength, and all the Scots that dwelt in England either conformed to\r\nthese, or returned into their own country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXIX. How the priest Wighard was sent from Britain to Rome, to be\r\nordained archbishop; of his death there, and of the letters of the\r\nApostolic Pope giving an account thereof. [667 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time the most noble kings of the English, Oswy, of the province of\r\nthe Northumbrians, and Egbert of Kent, consulted together to determine\r\nwhat ought to be done about the state of the English Church, for Oswy,\r\nthough educated by the Scots, had rightly perceived that the Roman was the\r\nCatholic and Apostolic Church. They selected, with the consent and by the\r\nchoice of the holy Church of the English nation, a priest named\r\nWighard,(500) one of Bishop Deusdedit’s clergy, a good man and fitted for\r\nthe episcopate, and sent him to Rome to be ordained bishop, to the end\r\nthat, having been raised to the rank of an archbishop, he might ordain\r\nCatholic prelates for the Churches of the English nation throughout all\r\nBritain. But Wighard, arriving at Rome, was cut off by death, before he\r\ncould be consecrated bishop, and the following letter was sent back into\r\nBritain to King Oswy:—\r\n\r\n“_To the most excellent lord, our son, Oswy, king of the __ Saxons,\r\nVitalian,_(_501_)_ bishop, servant of the servants of God._ We have\r\nreceived to our comfort your Excellency’s letters; by reading whereof we\r\nare acquainted with your most pious devotion and fervent love of the\r\nblessed life; and know that by the protecting hand of God you have been\r\nconverted to the true and Apostolic faith, in hope that even as you reign\r\nin your own nation, so you may hereafter reign with Christ. Blessed be the\r\nnation, therefore, that has been found worthy to have as its king one so\r\nwise and a worshipper of God; forasmuch as he is not himself alone a\r\nworshipper of God, but also studies day and night the conversion of all\r\nhis subjects to the Catholic and Apostolic faith, to the redemption of his\r\nown soul. Who would not rejoice at hearing such glad tidings? Who would\r\nnot exult and be joyful at these good works? For your nation has believed\r\nin Christ the Almighty God, according to the words of the Divine prophets,\r\nas it is written in Isaiah, ‘In that day there shall be a root of Jesse,\r\nwhich shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles\r\nseek.’(502) And again, ‘Listen, O isles, unto me, and hearken ye people\r\nfrom far.’(503) And a little after, ‘It is a light thing that thou\r\nshouldst be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the\r\noutcast of Israel. I have given thee for a light to the Gentiles, that\r\nthou mayst be my salvation unto the end of the earth.’(504) And again,\r\n‘Kings shall see, princes also shall arise and worship.’(505) And\r\nimmediately after, ‘I have given thee for a covenant of the people, to\r\nestablish the earth, and possess the scattered heritages; that thou mayest\r\nsay to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Show\r\nyourselves.’(506) And again, ‘I the Lord have called thee in\r\nrighteousness, and have held thine hand, and have kept thee, and have\r\ngiven thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; to\r\nopen the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoner from the prison, and them\r\nthat sit in darkness from the prison-house.’(507)\r\n\r\n“Behold, most excellent son, how it is plain as day that it was prophesied\r\nnot only of you, but also of all the nations, that they should believe in\r\nChrist, the Creator of all things. Wherefore it behoves your Highness, as\r\nbeing a member of Christ, in all things continually to follow the pious\r\nrule of the chief of the Apostles, in celebrating Easter, and in all\r\nthings delivered by the holy Apostles, Peter and Paul, whose doctrine\r\ndaily enlightens the hearts of believers, even as the two lights of heaven\r\nillumine the world.”\r\n\r\nAnd after some lines, wherein he speaks of celebrating the true Easter\r\nuniformly throughout all the world,—\r\n\r\n“Finally,” he adds, “we have not been able now, on account of the length\r\nof the journey, to find a man, apt to teach, and qualified in all respects\r\nto be a bishop, according to the tenor of your letters.(508) But,\r\nassuredly, as soon as such a fit person shall be found, we will send him\r\nwell instructed to your country, that he may, by word of mouth, and\r\nthrough the Divine oracles, with the blessing of God, root out all the\r\nenemy’s tares throughout your island. We have received the presents sent\r\nby your Highness to the blessed chief of the Apostles, for an eternal\r\nmemorial of him, and return you thanks, and always pray for your safety\r\nwith the clergy of Christ. But he that brought these presents has been\r\nremoved out of this world, and is buried at the threshold of the Apostles,\r\nfor whom we have been much grieved, because he died here. Nevertheless, we\r\nhave caused the blessed gifts of the saints, that is, the relics of the\r\nblessed Apostles, Peter and Paul, and of the holy martyrs, Laurentius,\r\nJohn, and Paul, and Gregory, and Pancratius,(509) to be given to your\r\nservants, the bearers of these our letters, to be by them delivered to\r\nyour Excellency. And to your consort(510) also, our spiritual daughter, we\r\nhave by the aforesaid bearers sent a cross, with a gold key to it, made\r\nout of the most holy chains of the blessed Apostles, Peter and Paul; for,\r\nhearing of her pious zeal, all the Apostolic see rejoices with us, even as\r\nher pious works smell sweet and blossom before God.\r\n\r\n“We therefore desire that your Highness should hasten, according to our\r\nwish, to dedicate all your island to Christ our God; for assuredly you\r\nhave for your Protector, the Redeemer of mankind, our Lord Jesus Christ,\r\nWho will prosper you in all things, that you may gather together a new\r\npeople of Christ, establishing there the Catholic and Apostolic faith. For\r\nit is written, ‘Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness,\r\nand all these things shall be added unto you.’(511) Truly your Highness\r\nseeks, and shall obtain, and all your islands shall be made subject to\r\nyou, even as we desire. Saluting your Excellency with fatherly affection,\r\nwe never cease to pray to the Divine Goodness, to vouchsafe to assist you\r\nand yours in all good works, that you may reign with Christ in the world\r\nto come. May the Heavenly Grace preserve your Excellency in safety!”\r\n\r\nIn the next book we shall have a more suitable occasion to show who was\r\nselected and consecrated in Wighard’s place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXX. How the East Saxons, during a pestilence, returned to idolatry,\r\nbut were soon brought back from their error by the zeal of Bishop Jaruman.\r\n[665 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the Kings Sighere and Sebbi,(512) though themselves\r\nsubject to Wulfhere, king of the Mercians, governed the province of the\r\nEast Saxons after Suidhelm, of whom we have spoken above.(513) When that\r\nprovince was suffering from the aforesaid disastrous plague, Sighere, with\r\nhis part of the people, forsook the mysteries of the Christian faith, and\r\nturned apostate. For the king himself, and many of the commons and nobles,\r\nloving this life, and not seeking after another, or even not believing in\r\nany other, began to restore the temples that had been abandoned, and to\r\nadore idols, as if they might by those means be protected against the\r\nplague. But Sebbi, his companion and co-heir in the kingdom, with all his\r\npeople, very devoutly preserved the faith which he had received, and, as\r\nwe shall show hereafter, ended his faithful life in great felicity.\r\n\r\nKing Wulfhere, hearing that the faith of the province was in part\r\nprofaned, sent Bishop Jaruman,(514) who was successor to Trumhere, to\r\ncorrect their error, and recall the province to the true faith. He acted\r\nwith much discretion, as I was informed by a priest who bore him company\r\nin that journey, and had been his fellow labourer in the Word, for he was\r\na religious and good man, and travelling through all the country, far and\r\nnear, brought back both the people and the aforesaid king to the way of\r\nrighteousness, so that, either forsaking or destroying the temples and\r\naltars which they had erected, they opened the churches, and gladly\r\nconfessed the Name of Christ, which they had opposed, choosing rather to\r\ndie in the faith of resurrection in Him, than to live in the abominations\r\nof unbelief among their idols. Having thus accomplished their works, the\r\npriests and teachers returned home with joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. I. How when Deusdedit died, Wighard was sent to Rome to receive the\r\nepiscopate; but he dying there, Theodore was ordained archbishop, and sent\r\ninto Britain with the Abbot Hadrian. [664-669 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the above-mentioned year of the aforesaid eclipse(515) and of the\r\npestilence which followed it immediately, in which also Bishop Colman,\r\nbeing overcome by the united effort of the Catholics, returned home,(516)\r\nDeusdedit,(517) the sixth bishop of the church of Canterbury, died on the\r\n14th of July. Earconbert,(518) also, king of Kent, departed this life the\r\nsame month and day; leaving his kingdom to his son Egbert, who held it for\r\nnine years. The see then became vacant for no small time, until, the\r\npriest Wighard,(519) a man of great learning in the teaching of the\r\nChurch, of the English race, was sent to Rome by King Egbert and Oswy,\r\nking of the Northumbrians, as was briefly mentioned in the foregoing\r\nbook,(520) with a request that he might be ordained Archbishop of the\r\nChurch of England; and at the same time presents were sent to the\r\nApostolic pope, and many vessels of gold and silver. Arriving at Rome,\r\nwhere Vitalian(521) presided at that time over the Apostolic see, and\r\nhaving made known to the aforesaid Apostolic pope the occasion of his\r\njourney, he was not long after carried off, with almost all his companions\r\nwho had come with him, by a pestilence which fell upon them.\r\n\r\nBut the Apostolic pope having consulted about that matter, made diligent\r\ninquiry for some one to send to be archbishop of the English Churches.\r\nThere was then in the monastery of Niridanum, which is not far from Naples\r\nin Campania, an abbot called Hadrian,(522) by nation an African, well\r\nversed in Holy Scripture, trained in monastic and ecclesiastical teaching,\r\nand excellently skilled both in the Greek and Latin tongues. The pope,\r\nsending for him, commanded him to accept the bishopric and go to Britain.\r\nHe answered, that he was unworthy of so great a dignity, but said that he\r\ncould name another, whose learning and age were fitter for the episcopal\r\noffice. He proposed to the pope a certain monk named Andrew, belonging to\r\na neighbouring nunnery(523) and he was by all that knew him judged worthy\r\nof a bishopric; but the weight of bodily infirmity prevented him from\r\nbecoming a bishop. Then again Hadrian was urged to accept the episcopate;\r\nbut he desired a respite, to see whether in time he could find another to\r\nbe ordained bishop.\r\n\r\nThere was at that time in Rome, a monk, called Theodore,(524) known to\r\nHadrian, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, a man instructed in secular and Divine\r\nwritings, as also in Greek and Latin; of high character and venerable age,\r\nbeing sixty-six years old. Hadrian proposed him to the pope to be ordained\r\nbishop, and prevailed; but upon the condition that he should himself\r\nconduct him into Britain, because he had already travelled through Gaul\r\ntwice upon different occasions, and was, therefore, better acquainted with\r\nthe way, and was, moreover, sufficiently provided with men of his own; as\r\nalso, to the end that, being his fellow labourer in teaching, he might\r\ntake special care that Theodore should not, according to the custom of the\r\nGreeks, introduce any thing contrary to the truth of the faith into the\r\nChurch where he presided.(525) Theodore, being ordained subdeacon, waited\r\nfour months for his hair to grow, that it might be shorn into the shape of\r\na crown; for he had before the tonsure of St. Paul,(526) the Apostle,\r\nafter the manner of the eastern people. He was ordained by Pope Vitalian,\r\nin the year of our Lord 668, on Sunday, the 26th of March, and on the 27th\r\nof May was sent with Hadrian to Britain.(527)\r\n\r\nThey proceeded together by sea to Marseilles, and thence by land to Arles,\r\nand having there delivered to John, archbishop of that city,(528) Pope\r\nVitalian’s letters of recommendation, were by him detained till\r\nEbroin,(529) the king’s mayor of the palace, gave them leave to go where\r\nthey pleased. Having received the same, Theodore went to Agilbert, bishop\r\nof Paris,(530) of whom we have spoken above, and was by him kindly\r\nreceived, and long entertained. But Hadrian went first to Emme, Bishop of\r\nthe Senones,(531) and then to Faro,(532) bishop of the Meldi, and lived in\r\ncomfort with them a considerable time; for the approach of winter had\r\nobliged them to rest wherever they could. King Egbert, being informed by\r\nsure messengers that the bishop they had asked of the Roman prelate was in\r\nthe kingdom of the Franks, sent thither his reeve,(533) Raedfrid, to\r\nconduct him. He, having arrived there, with Ebroin’s leave took Theodore\r\nand conveyed him to the port called Quentavic;(534) where, falling sick,\r\nhe stayed some time, and as soon as he began to recover, sailed over into\r\nBritain. But Ebroin detained Hadrian, suspecting that he went on some\r\nmission from the Emperor to the kings of Britain, to the prejudice of the\r\nkingdom of which he at that time had the chief charge; however, when he\r\nfound that in truth he had never had any such commission, he discharged\r\nhim, and permitted him to follow Theodore. As soon as he came to him,\r\nTheodore gave him the monastery of the blessed Peter the Apostle,(535)\r\nwhere the archbishops of Canterbury are wont to be buried, as I have said\r\nbefore; for at his departure, the Apostolic lord had enjoined upon\r\nTheodore that he should provide for him in his province, and give him a\r\nsuitable place to live in with his followers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. II. How Theodore visited all places; how the Churches of the English\r\nbegan to be instructed in the study of Holy Scripture, and in the Catholic\r\ntruth; and how Putta was made bishop of the Church of Rochester in the\r\nroom of Damianus. [669 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTheodore came to his Church in the second year after his consecration, on\r\nSunday, the 27th of May, and spent in it twenty-one years, three months,\r\nand twenty-six days. Soon after, he visited all the island, wherever the\r\ntribes of the English dwelt, for he was gladly received and heard by all\r\npersons; and everywhere attended and assisted by Hadrian, he taught the\r\nright rule of life, and the canonical custom of celebrating Easter. This\r\nwas the first archbishop whom all the English Church consented to obey.\r\nAnd forasmuch as both of them were, as has been said before, fully\r\ninstructed both in sacred and in secular letters, they gathered a crowd of\r\ndisciples, and rivers of wholesome knowledge daily flowed from them to\r\nwater the hearts of their hearers; and, together with the books of Holy\r\nScripture, they also taught them the metrical art, astronomy, and\r\necclesiastical arithmetic. A testimony whereof is, that there are still\r\nliving at this day some of their scholars, who are as well versed in the\r\nGreek and Latin tongues as in their own, in which they were born. Nor were\r\nthere ever happier times since the English came into Britain; for having\r\nbrave Christian kings, they were a terror to all barbarous nations, and\r\nthe minds of all men were bent upon the joys of the heavenly kingdom of\r\nwhich they had but lately heard; and all who desired to be instructed in\r\nsacred studies had masters at hand to teach them.\r\n\r\nFrom that time also they began in all the churches of the English to learn\r\nChurch music, which till then had been only known in Kent. And, excepting\r\nJames, of whom we have spoken above,(536) the first teacher of singing in\r\nthe churches of the Northumbrians was Eddi, surnamed Stephen,(537) invited\r\nfrom Kent by the most reverend Wilfrid, who was the first of the bishops\r\nof the English nation that learned to deliver to the churches of the\r\nEnglish the Catholic manner of life.(538)\r\n\r\nTheodore, journeying through all parts, ordained bishops in fitting\r\nplaces, and with their assistance corrected such things as he found\r\nfaulty. Among the rest, when he charged Bishop Ceadda with not having been\r\nduly consecrated,(539) he, with great humility, answered, “If you know\r\nthat I have not duly received episcopal ordination, I willingly resign the\r\noffice, for I never thought myself worthy of it; but, though unworthy, for\r\nobedience sake I submitted, when bidden to undertake it.” Theodore,\r\nhearing his humble answer, said that he should not resign the bishopric,\r\nand he himself completed his ordination after the Catholic manner. Now at\r\nthe time when Deusdedit died, and a bishop for the church of Canterbury\r\nwas by request ordained and sent, Wilfrid was also sent from Britain into\r\nGaul to be ordained; and because he returned before Theodore, he ordained\r\npriests and deacons in Kent till the archbishop should come to his see.\r\nBut when Theodore came to the city of Rochester, where the bishopric had\r\nbeen long vacant by the death of Damian,(540) he ordained a man named\r\nPutta,(541) trained rather in the teaching of the Church and more addicted\r\nto simplicity of life than active in worldly affairs, but specially\r\nskilful in Church music, after the Roman use, which he had learned from\r\nthe disciples of the blessed Pope Gregory.(542)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. III. How the above-mentioned Ceadda was made Bishop of the province\r\nof Mercians. Of his life, death, and burial. [669 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that time, the province of the Mercians was governed by King Wulfhere,\r\nwho, on the death of Jaruman,(543) desired of Theodore that a bishop\r\nshould be given to him and his people; but Theodore would not ordain a new\r\none for them, but requested of King Oswy that Ceadda might be their\r\nbishop. He then lived in retirement at his monastery, which is at\r\nLaestingaeu,(544) while Wilfrid administered the bishopric of York, and of\r\nall the Northumbrians, and likewise of the Picts, as far as King Oswy was\r\nable to extend his dominions. And, seeing that it was the custom of that\r\nmost reverend prelate to go about the work of the Gospel everywhere on\r\nfoot rather than on horseback, Theodore commanded him to ride whenever he\r\nhad a long journey to undertake; and finding him very unwilling, in his\r\nzeal and love for his pious labour, he himself, with his own hands, lifted\r\nhim on horseback; for he knew him to be a holy man, and therefore obliged\r\nhim to ride wherever he had need to go. Ceadda having received the\r\nbishopric of the Mercians and of Lindsey,(545) took care to administer it\r\nwith great perfection of life, according to the example of the ancient\r\nfathers. King Wulfhere also gave him land of the extent of fifty families,\r\nto build a monastery, at the place called Ad Barvae,(546) or “At the\r\nWood,” in the province of Lindsey, wherein traces of the monastic life\r\ninstituted by him continue to this day.\r\n\r\nHe had his episcopal see in the place called Lyccidfelth,(547) in which he\r\nalso died, and was buried, and where the see of the succeeding bishops of\r\nthat province continues to this day. He had built himself a retired\r\nhabitation not far from the church, wherein he was wont to pray and read\r\nin private, with a few, it might be seven or eight of the brethren, as\r\noften as he had any spare time from the labour and ministry of the Word.\r\nWhen he had most gloriously governed the church in that province for two\r\nyears and a half, the Divine Providence so ordaining, there came round a\r\nseason like that of which Ecclesiastes says, “That there is a time to cast\r\naway stones, and a time to gather stones together;”(548) for a plague fell\r\nupon them, sent from Heaven, which, by means of the death of the flesh,\r\ntranslated the living stones of the Church from their earthly places to\r\nthe heavenly building. And when, after many of the Church of that most\r\nreverend prelate had been taken away out of the flesh, his hour also drew\r\nnear wherein he was to pass out of this world to the Lord, it happened one\r\nday that he was in the aforesaid habitation with only one brother, called\r\nOwini,(549) his other companions having upon some due occasion returned to\r\nthe church. Now Owini was a monk of great merit, having forsaken the world\r\nwith the sole desire of the heavenly reward; worthy in all respects to\r\nhave the secrets of the Lord revealed to him in special wise, and worthy\r\nto have credit given by his hearers to what he said. For he had come with\r\nQueen Ethelthryth(550) from the province of the East Angles, and was the\r\nchief of her thegns, and governor of her house. As the fervour of his\r\nfaith increased, resolving to renounce the secular life, he did not go\r\nabout it slothfully, but so entirely forsook the things of this world,\r\nthat, quitting all that he had, clad in a plain garment, and carrying an\r\naxe and hatchet in his hand, he came to the monastery of the same most\r\nreverend father, which is called Laestingaeu. He said that he was not\r\nentering the monastery in order to live in idleness, as some do, but to\r\nlabour; which he also confirmed by practice; for as he was less capable of\r\nstudying the Scriptures, the more earnestly he applied himself to the\r\nlabour of his hands. So then, forasmuch as he was reverent and devout, he\r\nwas kept by the bishop in the aforesaid habitation with the brethren, and\r\nwhilst they were engaged within in reading, he was without, doing such\r\nthings as were necessary.\r\n\r\nOne day, when he was thus employed abroad, his companions having gone to\r\nthe church, as I began to tell, and the bishop was alone reading or\r\npraying in the oratory of that place, on a sudden, as he afterwards said,\r\nhe heard a sweet sound of singing and rejoicing descend from heaven to\r\nearth. This sound he said he first heard coming from the sky in the\r\nsouth-east, above the winter sunrise, and that afterwards it drew near him\r\ngradually, till it came to the roof of the oratory where the bishop was,\r\nand entering therein, filled all the place and encompassed it about. He\r\nlistened attentively to what he heard, and after about half an hour,\r\nperceived the same song of joy to ascend from the roof of the said\r\noratory, and to return to heaven in the same way as it came, with\r\nunspeakable sweetness. When he had stood some time amazed, and earnestly\r\nconsidering in his mind what this might be, the bishop opened the window\r\nof the oratory, and making a sound with his hand, as he was often wont to\r\ndo, bade anyone who might be without to come in to him. He went hastily\r\nin, and the bishop said to him, “Make haste to the church, and cause those\r\nseven brothers to come hither, and do you come with them.” When they were\r\ncome, he first admonished them to preserve the virtue of love and peace\r\namong themselves, and towards all the faithful; and with unwearied\r\nearnestness to follow the rules of monastic discipline, which they had\r\neither been taught by him, and had seen him observe, or had found in the\r\nwords and actions of the former fathers. Then he added that the day of his\r\ndeath was at hand; for, said he, “that gracious guest, who was wont to\r\nvisit our brethren, has vouchsafed also to come to me this day, and to\r\ncall me out of this world. Return, therefore, to the church, and speak to\r\nthe brethren, that in their prayers they commend my departure to the Lord,\r\nand that they be mindful to prepare for their own, the hour whereof is\r\nuncertain, by watching, and prayer, and good works.”\r\n\r\nWhen he had spoken thus much and more to the same end, and they, having\r\nreceived his blessing, had gone away in great sorrow, he who had heard the\r\nheavenly song returned alone, and prostrating himself on the ground, said,\r\n“I beseech you, father, may I be permitted to ask a question?”—“Ask what\r\nyou will,” answered the bishop. Then he said, “I beseech you to tell me\r\nwhat was that song which I heard as of a joyful company coming from heaven\r\nupon this oratory, and after some time returning to heaven?” The bishop\r\nanswered: “If you heard the singing, and know of the coming of the\r\nheavenly company, I command you, in the Name of the Lord, that you tell it\r\nnot to any before my death. But in truth they were angelic spirits, who\r\ncame to call me to my heavenly reward, which I have always loved and\r\nlonged after, and they promised that they would return seven days hence,\r\nand take me away with them.” Which was indeed fulfilled, as had been said\r\nto him; for being presently seized with bodily infirmity, and the same\r\ndaily increasing, on the seventh day, as had been promised to him, when he\r\nhad prepared for death by receiving the Body and Blood of our Lord, his\r\nsaintly soul being delivered from the prison of the body, led, as may\r\njustly be believed, by the attendant angels, he departed to the joys of\r\nHeaven.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that he joyfully beheld the day of his death, or rather\r\nthe day of the Lord, the coming whereof he had always been mindful to\r\nawait with earnest expectation. For with all his merits of continence,\r\nhumility, teaching, prayer, voluntary poverty, and other virtues, he was\r\nso filled with the fear of the Lord, so mindful of his latter end in all\r\nhis actions, that, as I was wont to hear from one of the brothers who\r\ninstructed me in the Scriptures, and who had been bred in his monastery,\r\nand under his direction, whose name was Trumbert, if it happened that\r\nthere blew a sudden strong gust of wind, when he was reading or doing any\r\nother thing, he forthwith called upon the Lord for mercy, and begged that\r\nit might be granted to all mankind. If the wind grew stronger, he closed\r\nhis book, and fell on his face, praying still more earnestly. But, if a\r\nviolent storm of wind or rain came on, or if the earth and air were filled\r\nwith the terror of thunder and lightning, he would go to the church, and\r\nanxiously devote himself with all his heart to prayers and psalms till the\r\nweather became calm. Being asked by his brethren why he did so, he\r\nanswered, “Have not you read—‘The Lord also thundered in the heavens, and\r\nthe Highest gave his voice. Yea, he sent out his arrows and scattered\r\nthem; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.’(551) For the Lord\r\nmoves the air, raises the winds, hurls lightning, and thunders from\r\nheaven, to rouse the inhabitants of the earth to fear him; to put them in\r\nmind of judgement to come; to dispel their pride, and confound their\r\nboldness, by recalling to their thoughts that dread time, when the heavens\r\nand the earth being on fire, He will come in the clouds, with great power\r\nand majesty, to judge the quick and the dead. Wherefore,” said he, “it\r\nbehoves us to respond to His heavenly admonition with due fear and love;\r\nthat, as often as the air is moved and He puts forth His hand threatening\r\nto strike, but does not yet let it fall, we may immediately implore His\r\nmercy; and searching the recesses of our hearts, and casting out the dregs\r\nof our sins, we may carefully so act that we may never deserve to be\r\nstruck down.”\r\n\r\nWith this revelation and narrative of the aforesaid brother, concerning\r\nthe death of this prelate, agrees the account of the most reverend Father\r\nEgbert, above spoken of,(552) who long and zealously led a monastic life\r\nwith the same Ceadda, when both were youths, in Ireland, in prayer and\r\nself-denial and meditation on the Holy Scriptures. But whereas Ceadda\r\nafterwards returned into his own country, Egbert continued to live abroad\r\nfor the Lord’s sake till the end of his life. A long time after, Hygbald,\r\na man of great holiness and continence, who was an abbot in the province\r\nof Lindsey,(553) came from Britain to visit him, and whilst, as became\r\nholy men, they were discoursing of the life of the former fathers, and\r\nrejoicing to imitate the same, mention was made of the most reverend\r\nprelate, Ceadda; whereupon Egbert said, “I know a man in this island,\r\nstill in the flesh, who, when Ceadda passed away from this world, saw the\r\nsoul of his brother Cedd, with a company of angels, descending from\r\nheaven, who, having taken Ceadda’s soul along with them, returned again to\r\nthe heavenly kingdom.” Whether he said this of himself, or some other, we\r\ndo not certainly know; but because it was said by so great a man, there\r\ncan be no doubt of the truth thereof.\r\n\r\nCeadda died on the 2nd of March,(554) and was first buried by St. Mary’s\r\nChurch, but afterwards, when the church of the most blessed chief of the\r\nApostles, Peter, was built in the same place, his bones were translated\r\ninto it. In both which places, as a testimony of his virtue, frequent\r\nmiracles of healing are wont to be wrought. And of late, a certain man\r\nthat had a frenzy, wandering about everywhere, arrived there in the\r\nevening, unperceived or disregarded by the keepers of the place, and\r\nhaving rested there the whole of the night, came forth in his right mind\r\nthe next morning, to the surprise and joy of all, and told what a cure had\r\nbeen wrought on him through the goodness of God. The place of the\r\nsepulchre is a wooden monument, made like a little house, covered, having\r\na hole in the wall, through which those that go thither for devotion are\r\nwont to put in their hand and take out some of the dust. This they put\r\ninto water and give to sick cattle or men to drink, whereupon they are\r\npresently eased of their infirmity, and restored to their desired health.\r\n\r\nIn his place, Theodore ordained Wynfrid,(555) a man of good and sober\r\nlife, to preside, like his predecessors, over the bishoprics of the\r\nMercians, the Midland Angles, and Lindsey, of all which, Wulfhere, who was\r\nstill living, was king. Wynfrid was one of the clergy of the prelate he\r\nsucceeded, and had for no small time filled the office of deacon under\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. IV. How Bishop Colman, having left Britain, built two monasteries in\r\nthe country of the Scots; the one for the Scots, the other for the English\r\nwhom he had taken along with him. [667 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Colman, the Scottish bishop, departing from Britain,(556)\r\ntook along with him all the Scots whom he had gathered about him in the\r\nisle of Lindisfarne, and also about thirty of the English nation, for both\r\nthese companies had been trained in duties of the monastic life; and\r\nleaving some brothers in his church, he went first to the isle of\r\nHii,(557) whence he had been sent to preach the Word of God to the English\r\nnation. Afterwards he retired to a small island, which is to the west of\r\nIreland, and at some distance from it, called in the language of the\r\nScots, Inisboufinde,(558) the Island of the White Heifer. Arriving there,\r\nhe built a monastery, and placed in it the monks he had brought of both\r\nnations. But they could not agree among themselves, by reason that the\r\nScots, in the summer season, when the harvest was to be brought in,\r\nleaving the monastery, wandered about through places known to them; but\r\nreturned again the next winter, and desired to use in common what the\r\nEnglish had provided. Colman sought to put an end to this dissension, and\r\ntravelling about far and near, he found a place in the island of Ireland\r\nfitted to be the site of a monastery, which, in the language of the Scots,\r\nis called Mageo.(559) He bought a small part of it of the chief to whom it\r\nbelonged, to build his monastery thereon; upon condition, that the monks\r\ndwelling there should pray to the Lord for him who let them have the\r\nplace. Then at once building a monastery, with the assistance of the chief\r\nand all the neighbouring people, he placed the English there, leaving the\r\nScots in the aforesaid island. This monastery is to this day occupied by\r\nEnglish inhabitants; being the same that, grown from a small beginning to\r\nbe very large, is commonly called Muigeo; and as all have long since been\r\nbrought to adopt better customs, it contains a notable society of monks,\r\nwho are gathered there from the province of the English, and live by the\r\nlabour of their own hands, after the example of the venerable fathers,\r\nunder a rule and a canonical abbot, in much continence and singleness of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. V. Of the death of the kings Oswy and Egbert, and of the synod held\r\nat the place Herutford,(560) in which Archbishop Theodore presided.\r\n[670-673 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 670,(561) being the second year after Theodore\r\narrived in England, Oswy, king of the Northumbrians, fell sick, and died,\r\nin the fifty-eighth year of his age.(562) He at that time bore so great\r\naffection to the Roman Apostolic usages, that he had designed, if he\r\nrecovered from his sickness, to go to Rome, and there to end his days at\r\nthe holy places, having asked Bishop Wilfrid, with a promise of no small\r\ngift of money, to conduct him on his journey. He died on the 15th of\r\nFebruary, leaving his son Egfrid(563) his successor in the kingdom. In the\r\nthird year of his reign, Theodore assembled a council of bishops, along\r\nwith many other teachers of the church, who loved and were acquainted with\r\nthe canonical statutes of the fathers. When they were met together, he\r\nbegan, in the spirit which became a bishop, to enjoin the observance of\r\nsuch things as were in accordance with the unity and the peace of the\r\nChurch. The purport of the proceedings of this synod is as follows:—(564)\r\n\r\n“In the name of our Lord God and Saviour Jesus Christ, Who reigns for ever\r\nand governs His Church, it was thought meet that we should assemble,\r\naccording to the custom prescribed in the venerable canons, to treat about\r\nthe necessary affairs of the Church. We met on the 24th day of September,\r\nthe first indiction,(565) at the place which is called Herutford: I,\r\nTheodore, albeit unworthy, appointed by the Apostolic see bishop of the\r\nchurch of Canterbury; our fellow priest and brother, the most reverend\r\nBisi, bishop of the East Angles; and with us also our brother and fellow\r\npriest, Wilfrid, bishop of the nation of the Northumbrians, represented by\r\nhis proxies. There were present also our brothers and fellow priests,\r\nPutta, bishop of the Kentish castle, called Rochester; Leutherius, bishop\r\nof the West Saxons, and Wynfrid, bishop of the province of the\r\nMercians.(566) When we were all met together, and had sat down in order, I\r\nsaid, ‘I beseech you, most dear brothers, for the fear and love of our\r\nRedeemer, that we may all treat in common on behalf of our faith; to the\r\nend that whatsoever has been decreed and defined by holy and approved\r\nfathers, may be inviolably observed by all of us.’ This and much more I\r\nspoke tending to charity and the preservation of the unity of the Church;\r\nand when I had ended my preface, I asked every one of them in order,\r\nwhether they consented to observe the things that had been of old\r\ncanonically decreed by the fathers? To which all our fellow priests\r\nanswered, ‘Most assuredly we are all resolved to observe willingly and\r\nheartily whatsoever is laid down in the canons of the holy fathers.’ Then\r\nforthwith I produced the said book of canons,(567) and in the presence of\r\nthem all showed ten articles in the same, which I had marked in several\r\nplaces, because I knew them to be of the most importance to us, and\r\nentreated that these might be most particularly received by them all.\r\n\r\n“Article I. That we all in common keep the holy day of Easter on the\r\nSunday after the fourteenth moon of the first month.\r\n\r\n“II. That no bishop intrude into the diocese of another, but be satisfied\r\nwith the government of the people committed to him.\r\n\r\n“III. That it shall not be lawful for any bishop to disturb in any matter\r\nmonasteries dedicated to God, nor to take away forcibly any part of their\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n“IV. That the monks themselves do not move from one place to another, that\r\nis, from monastery to monastery, unless with the consent of their own\r\nabbot; but that they continue in the obedience which they promised at the\r\ntime of their conversion.\r\n\r\n“V. That no clerk, forsaking his own bishop, shall wander about, or be\r\nanywhere received without commendatory letters from his diocesan. But if\r\nhe shall be once received, and will not return when summoned, both the\r\nreceiver, and he that is received shall be under excommunication.\r\n\r\n“VI. That bishops and clergy, when travelling, shall be content with the\r\nhospitality that is afforded them; and that it be not lawful for any one\r\nof them to exercise any priestly function without leave of the bishop in\r\nwhose diocese he is known to be.\r\n\r\n“VII. That a synod be assembled twice a year; but on account of divers\r\nhindrances, it was approved by all, that we should meet once a year, on\r\nthe 1st of August, at the place called Clofeshoch.(568)\r\n\r\n“VIII. That no bishop, through ambition, shall set himself above another;\r\nbut that they shall all observe the time and order of their consecration.\r\n\r\n“IX. The ninth Article was discussed in common, to the effect that more\r\nbishops should be made, as the number of the faithful increased; but this\r\nmatter for the present was passed over.(569)\r\n\r\n“X. Of marriages; that nothing be allowed but lawful wedlock; that none\r\ncommit incest; no man leave his own wife, except it be, as the holy Gospel\r\nteaches, for fornication. And if any man shall put away his own wife,\r\nlawfully joined to him in matrimony, that he take no other, if he wishes\r\nto be a true Christian, but continue as he is, or else be reconciled to\r\nhis own wife.\r\n\r\n“These articles being thus discussed and defined in common, to the end,\r\nthat for the future, no stumbling-block of contention might arise from any\r\none of us, or that things be falsely set forth, it was thought fit that\r\nevery one of us should, by the subscription of his own hand, confirm all\r\nthe particulars so defined. Which judgement, as defined by us, I dictated\r\nto be written by Titillus our notary. Given in the month and indiction\r\naforesaid. Whosoever, therefore, shall attempt in any way to oppose or\r\ninfringe this decision, confirmed by our consent, and by the subscription\r\nof our hands, according to the decree of the canons, must know, that he is\r\nexcluded from all sacerdotal functions, and from our fellowship. May the\r\nGrace of God keep us in safety, living in the unity of His Holy Church.”\r\n\r\nThis synod was held in the year of our Lord 673. In which year Egbert,\r\nking of Kent,(570) died in the month of July; his brother Hlothere(571)\r\nsucceeded him on the throne, which he held eleven years and seven months.\r\nBisi, the bishop of the East Angles, who is said to have been in the\r\naforesaid synod, a man of great saintliness and piety, was successor to\r\nBoniface,(572) before spoken of; for when Boniface died, after having been\r\nbishop seventeen years, he was ordained by Theodore and made bishop in his\r\nplace. Whilst he was still alive, but hindered by grievous infirmity from\r\nadministering his episcopal functions, two bishops, Aecci and Badwin, were\r\nelected and consecrated in his place; from which time to the present, that\r\nprovince has had two bishops.(573)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. VI. How Wynfrid being deposed, Sexwulf received his bishopric, and\r\nEarconwald was made bishop of the East Saxons. [675 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNot long after these events, Theodore, the archbishop, taking offence at\r\nsome act of disobedience of Wynfrid, bishop of the Mercians,(574) deposed\r\nhim from his bishopric when he had held it but a few years, and in his\r\nplace ordained Sexwulf bishop,(575) who was founder and abbot of the\r\nmonastery which is called Medeshamstead,(576) in the country of the\r\nGyrwas.(577) Wynfrid, thus deposed, returned to his monastery which is\r\ncalled Ad Barvae,(578) and there ended his life in holy conversation.\r\n\r\nTheodore then also appointed Earconwald,(579) bishop of the East Saxons,\r\nin the city of London, over whom at that time reigned Sebbi and Sighere,\r\nof whom mention has been made above.(580) This Earconwald’s life and\r\nconversation, as well when he was bishop as before that time, is said to\r\nhave been most holy, as is even now testified by heavenly miracles; for to\r\nthis day, his horse-litter, in which he was wont to be carried when sick,\r\nis kept by his disciples, and continues to cure many of fevers and other\r\nailments; and not only sick persons who are laid under that litter, or\r\nclose by it, are cured; but the very splinters cut from it, when carried\r\nto the sick, are wont immediately to bring healing to them.\r\n\r\nThis man, before he was made bishop, had built two famous monasteries, the\r\none for himself, and the other for his sister Ethelburg,(581) and\r\nestablished them both in regular discipline of the best kind. That for\r\nhimself was in the district of Sudergeona, by the river Thames, at a place\r\ncalled Cerotaesei,(582) that is, the Island of Cerot; that for his sister\r\nin the province of the East Saxons, at a place called In Berecingum,(583)\r\nwherein she might be a mother and nurse of women devoted to God. Being put\r\ninto the government of that monastery, she showed herself in all respects\r\nworthy of her brother the bishop, by her own holy life and by her regular\r\nand pious care of those under her rule, as was also manifested by heavenly\r\nmiracles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. VII. How it was indicated by a light from heaven where the bodies of\r\nthe nuns should be buried in the monastery of Berecingum. [675 A.D.?]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this monastery many miracles were wrought, accounts of which have been\r\ncommitted to writing by those who were acquainted with them, that their\r\nmemory might be preserved, and succeeding generations edified, and these\r\nare in the possession of many persons; some of them we also have taken\r\npains to include in our History of the Church. At the time of the\r\npestilence, already often mentioned,(584) which ravaged all the country\r\nfar and wide, it had also seized on that part of this monastery where the\r\nmen abode, and they were daily hurried away to the Lord. The careful\r\nmother of the community began often to inquire of the sisters, when they\r\nwere gathered together; in what part of the monastery they desired to be\r\nburied and a cemetery to be made, when the same affliction should fall\r\nupon that part of the monastery in which the handmaids of the Lord dwelt\r\ntogether apart from the men, and they should be snatched away out of this\r\nworld by the same destruction as the rest. Receiving no certain answer\r\nfrom the sisters, though she often questioned them, she and all of them\r\nreceived a most certain answer from the Divine Providence. For one night,\r\nafter matins had been sung, and those handmaids of Christ had gone out of\r\ntheir chapel to the tombs of the brothers who had departed this life\r\nbefore them, and were singing the customary songs of praise to the Lord,\r\non a sudden a light from heaven, like a great sheet, came down upon them\r\nall, and struck them with such amazement, that, in consternation, they\r\neven left off singing their hymn. But that resplendent light, in\r\ncomparison wherewith the sun at noon-day might seem dark, soon after,\r\nrising from that place, removed to the south side of the monastery, that\r\nis, to the westward of the chapel, and having continued there some time,\r\nand rested upon those parts, in the sight of them all withdrew itself\r\nagain to heaven, leaving no doubt in the minds of all, but that the same\r\nlight, which was to lead or to receive the souls of those handmaids of\r\nChrist into Heaven, also showed the place in which their bodies were to\r\nrest and await the day of the resurrection. The radiance of this light was\r\nso great, that one of the older brethren, who at the same time was in\r\ntheir chapel with another younger than himself, related in the morning,\r\nthat the rays of light which came in at the crannies of the doors and\r\nwindows, seemed to exceed the utmost brightness of daylight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. VIII. How a little boy, dying in the same monastery, called upon a\r\nvirgin that was to follow him; and how another nun, at the point of\r\nleaving her body, saw some small part of the future glory. [675 A.D.?]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was, in the same monastery, a boy, not above three years old, called\r\nAesica; who, by reason of his tender age, was being brought up among the\r\nvirgins dedicated to God, there to learn his lessons. This child being\r\nseized by the aforesaid pestilence, when his last hour was come, called\r\nthree times upon one of the virgins consecrated to Christ, speaking to her\r\nby her own name, as if she had been present, Eadgyth! Eadgyth! Eadgyth!\r\nand thus ending his temporal life, entered into that which is eternal. The\r\nvirgin, to whom he called, as he was dying, was immediately seized, where\r\nshe was, with the same sickness, and departing this life the same day on\r\nwhich she had been summoned, followed him that called her into the\r\nheavenly kingdom.\r\n\r\nLikewise, one of the same handmaids of God, being smitten with the same\r\ndisease, and reduced to the last extremity, began on a sudden, about\r\nmidnight, to cry out to them that ministered to her, desiring they would\r\nput out the lamp that was lighted there. And, when she had done this many\r\ntimes, and yet no one did her will, at last she said, “I know that you\r\nthink I am raving, when I say this, but be assured that it is not so; for\r\nI tell you truly, that I see this house filled with so great a light, that\r\nthat lamp of yours seems to me to be altogether dark.” And when still no\r\none replied to what she said, or did her bidding, she added, “Burn your\r\nlamp, then, as long as you will; but know, that it is not my light, for my\r\nlight will come to me at the dawn of day.” Then she began to tell, that a\r\ncertain man of God, who had died that same year, had appeared to her,\r\ntelling her that at the break of day she should depart to the eternal\r\nlight. The truth of which vision was speedily proved by the maiden’s death\r\nas soon as the day appeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. IX. Of the signs which were shown from Heaven when the mother of\r\nthat community departed this life. [675 A.D.?]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow when Ethelburg herself, the pious mother of that community devoted to\r\nGod, was about to be taken out of this world, a wonderful vision appeared\r\nto one of the sisters, called Tortgyth; who, having lived many years in\r\nthat monastery, always endeavoured, in all humility and sincerity, to\r\nserve God herself, and to help the mother to maintain regular discipline,\r\nby instructing and reproving the younger ones. Now, in order that her\r\nvirtue might, according to the Apostle, be made perfect in weakness, she\r\nwas suddenly seized with a most grievous bodily disease, under which,\r\nthrough the merciful providence of our Redeemer, she was sorely tried for\r\nthe space of nine years; to the end, that whatever stain of evil remained\r\namidst her virtues, either through ignorance or neglect, might all be\r\npurified in the furnace of long tribulation. This woman, going out of the\r\nchamber where she abode one night, at dusk, plainly saw as it were a human\r\nbody, which was brighter than the sun, wrapped in fine linen, and lifted\r\nup on high, being taken out of the house in which the sisters used to\r\nsleep. Then looking earnestly to see what it was that drew up that\r\nappearance of the glorious body which she beheld, she perceived that it\r\nwas raised on high as it were by cords brighter than gold, until, entering\r\ninto the open heavens, it could no longer be seen by her. Reflecting on\r\nthis vision, she made no doubt that some one of the community would soon\r\ndie, and her soul be lifted up to heaven by the good works which she had\r\nwrought, as it were by golden cords. And so in truth it befell; for a few\r\ndays after, the beloved of God, Ethelburg, mother of that community, was\r\ndelivered out of the prison of the flesh; and her life is proved to have\r\nbeen such that no one who knew her ought to doubt that an entrance into\r\nthe heavenly country was open to her, when she departed from this life.\r\n\r\nThere was also, in the same monastery, a certain nun, of noble origin in\r\nthis world, and still nobler in the love of the world to come; who had,\r\nfor many years, been so disabled in all her body, that she could not move\r\na single limb. When she heard that the body of the venerable abbess had\r\nbeen carried into the church, till it should be buried, she desired to be\r\ncarried thither, and to be placed bending towards it, after the manner of\r\none praying; which being done, she spoke to her as if she had been living,\r\nand entreated her that she would obtain of the mercy of our pitiful\r\nCreator, that she might be delivered from such great and long-continued\r\npains; nor was it long before her prayer was heard: for being delivered\r\nfrom the flesh twelve days after, she exchanged her temporal afflictions\r\nfor an eternal reward.\r\n\r\nFor three years after the death of her Superior, the aforesaid handmaid of\r\nChrist, Tortgyth, was detained in this life and was so far spent with the\r\nsickness before mentioned, that her bones scarce held together. At last,\r\nwhen the time of her release was at hand, she not only lost the use of her\r\nother limbs, but also of her tongue; in which state having continued three\r\ndays and as many nights, she was, on a sudden, restored by a spiritual\r\nvision, and opened her lips and eyes, and looking up to heaven, began thus\r\nto speak to the vision which she saw: “Very acceptable to me is thy\r\ncoming, and thou art welcome!” Having so said, she was silent awhile, as\r\nit were, waiting for the answer of him whom she saw and to whom she spoke;\r\nthen, as if somewhat displeased, she said, “I can in no wise gladly suffer\r\nthis;” then pausing awhile, she said again, “If it can by no means be\r\nto-day, I beg that the delay may not be long;” and again holding her peace\r\na short while, she concluded thus; “If it is certainly so determined, and\r\nthe decree cannot be altered, I beg that it may be no longer deferred than\r\nthis next night.” Having so said, and being asked by those about her with\r\nwhom she talked, she said, “With my most dear mother, Ethelburg;” by which\r\nthey understood, that she was come to acquaint her that the time of her\r\ndeparture was at hand; for, as she had desired, after one day and night,\r\nshe was delivered alike from the bonds of the flesh and of her infirmity\r\nand entered into the joys of eternal salvation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. X. How a blind woman, praying in the burial-place of that monastery,\r\nwas restored to her sight. [675 A.D.?]\r\n\r\n\r\nHildilid, a devout handmaid of God, succeeded Ethelburg in the office of\r\nabbess and presided over that monastery with great vigour many years, till\r\nshe was of an extreme old age,(585) in the observance of regular\r\ndiscipline, and carefully providing all things for the common use. The\r\nnarrowness of the space where the monastery is built, led her to determine\r\nthat the bones of the servants and handmaidens of Christ, who had been\r\nthere buried, should be taken up, and should all be translated into the\r\nchurch of the Blessed Mother of God, and interred in one place. How often\r\na brightness of heavenly light was seen there, when this was done, and a\r\nfragrancy of wonderful sweetness arose, and what other signs were\r\nrevealed, whosoever reads will find in the book from which we have taken\r\nthese tales.(586)\r\n\r\nBut in truth, I think it by no means fit to pass over the miracle of\r\nhealing, which the same book informs us was wrought in the cemetery of\r\nthat community dedicated to God. There lived in that neighbourhood a\r\ncertain thegn, whose wife was seized with a sudden dimness in her eyes,\r\nand as the malady increased daily, it became so burdensome to her, that\r\nshe could not see the least glimpse of light. Having continued some time\r\nwrapped in the night of this blindness, on a sudden she bethought herself\r\nthat she might recover her lost sight, if she were carried to the\r\nmonastery of the nuns, and there prayed at the relics of the saints. Nor\r\ndid she lose any time in fulfilling that which she had conceived in her\r\nmind: for being conducted by her maids to the monastery, which was very\r\nnear, and professing that she had perfect faith that she should be there\r\nhealed, she was led into the cemetery, and having long prayed there on her\r\nknees, she did not fail to be heard, for as she rose from prayer, before\r\nshe went out of the place, she received the gift of sight which she had\r\ndesired; and whereas she had been led thither by the hands of her maids,\r\nshe now returned home joyfully without help: as if she had lost the light\r\nof this world to no other end than that she might show by her recovery how\r\ngreat a light is vouchsafed to the saints of Christ in Heaven, and how\r\ngreat a grace of healing power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XI. How Sebbi, king of the same province, ended his life in a\r\nmonastery. [694 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that time, as the same little book informs us, Sebbi,(587) a very\r\ndevout man, of whom mention has been made above, governed the kingdom of\r\nthe East Saxons. His mind was set on religious acts, frequent prayer and\r\npious fruits of almsgiving; he esteemed a private and monastic life better\r\nthan all the wealth and honours of his kingdom, and he would have long\r\nbefore left his kingdom and adopted that life, had not his wife firmly\r\nrefused to be divorced from him; for which reason many were of opinion and\r\noften said that a man of such a disposition ought rather to have been made\r\na bishop than a king. When he had spent thirty years as a king and a\r\nsoldier of the heavenly kingdom, he fell into great bodily infirmity, of\r\nwhich he afterwards died, and he admonished his wife, that they should\r\nthen at least together devote themselves to the service of God, since they\r\ncould no longer together enjoy, or rather serve, the world. Having with\r\nmuch difficulty obtained this of her, he went to Waldhere, bishop of\r\nLondon, who had succeeded Earconwald,(588) and with his blessing received\r\nthe religious habit, which he had long desired. He also carried to him a\r\nconsiderable sum of money, to be given to the poor, reserving nothing to\r\nhimself, but rather coveting to remain poor in spirit for the sake of the\r\nkingdom of Heaven.\r\n\r\nWhen the aforesaid sickness increased, and he perceived the day of his\r\ndeath to be drawing near, being a man of a royal disposition, he began to\r\napprehend lest, when in great pain, at the approach of death, he might\r\ncommit anything unworthy of his character, either by word or gesture.\r\nWherefore, calling to him the aforesaid bishop of London, in which city he\r\nthen was, he entreated him that none might be present at his death,\r\nbesides the bishop himself, and two of his own attendants. The bishop\r\nhaving promised that he would most willingly grant his request, not long\r\nafter the man of God composed himself to sleep, and saw a consoling\r\nvision, which took from him all anxiety concerning the aforesaid\r\nuneasiness; and, moreover, showed him on what day he was to end his life.\r\nFor, as he afterwards related, he saw three men in shining garments come\r\nto him; one of whom sat down by his bed, whilst his companions who had\r\ncome with him stood and inquired about the state of the sick man they had\r\ncome to visit, and he said that the king’s soul should quit his body\r\nwithout any pain, and with a great splendour of light; and told him that\r\nhe should die the third day after. Both these things came to pass, as he\r\nhad learnt from the vision; for on the third day after, at the ninth hour,\r\nhe suddenly fell, as it were, into a light slumber, and without any sense\r\nof pain he gave up the ghost.\r\n\r\nA stone coffin had been prepared for his burial, but when they came to lay\r\nhim in it, they found his body a span longer than the coffin. Hereupon\r\nthey chipped away as much of the stone as they could, and made the coffin\r\nabout two inches longer; but not even so would it contain the body.\r\nWherefore because of this difficulty of entombing him, they had thoughts\r\neither to get another coffin, or else to shorten the body, by bending it\r\nat the knees, if they could, so that the coffin might contain it. But\r\nHeaven interposed and a miracle prevented the execution of either of those\r\ndesigns; for on a sudden, in the presence of the bishop and Sighard, who\r\nwas the son of that same king and monk, and who reigned after him jointly\r\nwith his brother Suefred,(589) and of no small number of men, that coffin\r\nwas found to fit the length of the body, insomuch that a pillow might even\r\nbe put in at the head; and at the feet the coffin was four inches longer\r\nthan the body. He was buried in the church of the blessed teacher of the\r\nGentiles,(590) by whose doctrine he had learned to hope for heavenly\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XII. How Haedde succeeded Leutherius in the bishopric of the West\r\nSaxons; how Cuichelm succeeded Putta in the bishopric of the church of\r\nRochester, and was himself succeeded by Gebmund; and who were then bishops\r\nof the Northumbrians. [673-681 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLeutherius was the fourth bishop of the West Saxons; for Birinus was the\r\nfirst, Agilbert the second, and Wini the third.(591) When Coinwalch,(592)\r\nin whose reign the said Leutherius was made bishop, died, the sub-kings\r\ntook upon them the government of the nation, and dividing it among\r\nthemselves, held it for about ten years; and during their rule he died,\r\nand Haedde(593) succeeded him in the bishopric, having been consecrated by\r\nTheodore, in the city of London. During his episcopate, Caedwalla,(594)\r\nhaving subdued and removed the sub-kings, took upon himself the supreme\r\nauthority. When he had held it for two years, and whilst the same bishop\r\nstill governed the church, at length impelled by love of the heavenly\r\nkingdom, he quitted it and, going away to Rome, ended his days there, as\r\nshall be said more fully hereafter.\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 676, when Ethelred, king of the Mercians,(595)\r\nravaged Kent with a hostile army, and profaned churches and monasteries,\r\nwithout regard to pity, or the fear of God, in the general destruction he\r\nlaid waste the city of Rochester; Putta,(596) who was bishop, was absent\r\nat that time, but when he understood that his church was ravaged, and\r\neverything taken away from it, he went to Sexwulf, bishop of the\r\nMercians,(597) and having received of him a certain church, and a small\r\npiece of land, ended his days there in peace; in no way endeavouring to\r\nrestore his bishopric, for, as has been said above, he was more\r\nindustrious in ecclesiastical than in worldly affairs; serving God only in\r\nthat church, and going wherever he was desired, to teach Church music.\r\nTheodore consecrated Cuichelm bishop of Rochester in his stead; but he,\r\nnot long after, departing from his bishopric for want of necessaries, and\r\nwithdrawing to other parts, Gebmund was put in his place by Theodore.(598)\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 678, which is the eighth of the reign of Egfrid,\r\nin the month of August, appeared a star, called a comet, which continued\r\nfor three months, rising in the morning, and sending forth, as it were, a\r\ntall pillar of radiant flame. The same year a dissension broke out between\r\nKing Egfrid and the most reverend prelate, Wilfrid, who was driven from\r\nhis see,(599) and two bishops substituted for him, to preside over the\r\nnation of the Northumbrians,(600) namely, Bosa,(601) to govern the\r\nprovince of the Deiri; and Eata(602) that of the Bernicians; the former\r\nhaving his episcopal see in the city of York, the latter either in the\r\nchurch of Hagustald, or of Lindisfarne; both of them promoted to the\r\nepiscopal dignity from a community of monks. With them also Eadhaed(603)\r\nwas ordained bishop for the province of Lindsey, which King Egfrid had but\r\nnewly acquired, having defeated Wulfhere and put him to flight;(604) and\r\nthis was the first bishop of its own which that province had; the second\r\nwas Ethelwin;(605) the third Edgar;(606) the fourth Cynibert,(607) who is\r\nthere at present. Before Eadhaed, Sexwulf(608) was bishop as well of that\r\nprovince as of the Mercians and Midland Angles; so that, when expelled\r\nfrom Lindsey, he continued in the government of those provinces. Eadhaed,\r\nBosa, and Eata, were ordained at York by archbishop Theodore;(609) who\r\nalso, three years after the departure of Wilfrid, added two bishops to\r\ntheir number: Tunbert,(610) appointed to the church of Hagustald, Eata\r\nstill continuing in that of Lindisfarne; and Trumwine(611) to the province\r\nof the Picts, which at that time was subject to English rule. Eadhaed\r\nreturning from Lindsey, because Ethelred had recovered that province,(612)\r\nwas placed by Theodore over the church of Ripon.(613)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XIII. How Bishop Wilfrid converted the province of the South Saxons\r\nto Christ. [681 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Wilfrid was expelled from his bishopric, and having long travelled in\r\nmany lands, went to Rome,(614) and afterwards returned to Britain. Though\r\nhe could not, by reason of the enmity of the aforesaid king, be received\r\ninto his own country or diocese, yet he could not be restrained from the\r\nministry of the Gospel; for, taking his way into the province of the South\r\nSaxons,(615) which extends from Kent to the south and west, as far as the\r\nWest Saxons, containing land of 7,000 families, and was at that time still\r\nin bondage to pagan rites, he administered to them the Word of faith, and\r\nthe Baptism of salvation. Ethelwalch,(616) king of that nation, had been,\r\nnot long before, baptized in the province of the Mercians, at the instance\r\nof King Wulfhere,(617) who was present, and received him as his godson\r\nwhen he came forth from the font, and in token of this adoption gave him\r\ntwo provinces, to wit, the Isle of Wight, and the province of the\r\nMeanware, in the country of the West Saxons.(618) The bishop, therefore,\r\nwith the king’s consent, or rather to his great joy, cleansed in the\r\nsacred font the foremost ealdormen and thegns of that country; and the\r\npriests, Eappa,(619) and Padda, and Burghelm, and Oiddi, either then, or\r\nafterwards, baptized the rest of the people. The queen, whose name was\r\nEabae, had been baptized in her own country, the province of the\r\nHwiccas.(620) She was the daughter of Eanfrid, the brother of\r\nAenhere,(621) who were both Christians, as were their people; but all the\r\nprovince of the South Saxons was ignorant of the Name of God and the\r\nfaith. But there was among them a certain monk of the Scottish nation,\r\nwhose name was Dicul,(622) who had a very small monastery, at the place\r\ncalled Bosanhamm,(623) encompassed by woods and seas, and in it there were\r\nfive or six brothers, who served the Lord in humility and poverty; but\r\nnone of the natives cared either to follow their course of life, or hear\r\ntheir preaching.\r\n\r\nBut Bishop Wilfrid, while preaching the Gospel to the people, not only\r\ndelivered them from the misery of eternal damnation, but also from a\r\nterrible calamity of temporal death. For no rain had fallen in that\r\ndistrict for three years before his arrival in the province, whereupon a\r\ngrievous famine fell upon the people and pitilessly destroyed them;\r\ninsomuch that it is said that often forty or fifty men, wasted with\r\nhunger, would go together to some precipice, or to the sea-shore, and\r\nthere, hand in hand, in piteous wise cast them themselves down either to\r\nperish by the fall, or be swallowed up by the waves. But on the very day\r\non which the nation received the Baptism of the faith, there fell a soft\r\nbut plentiful rain; the earth revived, the fields grew green again, and\r\nthe season was pleasant and fruitful. Thus the old superstition was cast\r\naway, and idolatry renounced, the heart and flesh of all rejoiced in the\r\nliving God, for they perceived that He Who is the true God had enriched\r\nthem by His heavenly grace with both inward and outward blessings. For the\r\nbishop, when he came into the province, and found so great misery from\r\nfamine there, taught them to get their food by fishing; for their sea and\r\nrivers abounded in fish, but the people had no skill to take any of them,\r\nexcept eels alone. The bishop’s men having gathered eel-nets everywhere,\r\ncast them into the sea, and by the blessing of God took three hundred\r\nfishes of divers sorts, which being divided into three parts, they gave a\r\nhundred to the poor, a hundred to those of whom they had the nets, and\r\nkept a hundred for their own use. By this benefit the bishop gained the\r\naffections of them all, and they began more readily at his preaching to\r\nhope for heavenly blessings, seeing that by his help they had received\r\nthose which are temporal.\r\n\r\nAt this time, King Ethelwalch gave to the most reverend prelate, Wilfrid,\r\nland to the extent of eighty-seven families, to maintain his company who\r\nwere wandering in exile. The place is called Selaeseu,(624) that is, the\r\nIsland of the Sea-Calf; it is encompassed by the sea on all sides, except\r\nthe west, where is an entrance about the cast of a sling in width; which\r\nsort of place is by the Latins called a peninsula, by the Greeks, a\r\ncherronesos. Bishop Wilfrid, having this place given him, founded therein\r\na monastery, chiefly of the brethren he had brought with him, and\r\nestablished a rule of life; and his successors are known to be there to\r\nthis day. He himself, both in word and deed performed the duties of a\r\nbishop in those parts during the space of five years, until the death of\r\nKing Egfrid,(625) and was justly honoured by all. And forasmuch as the\r\nking, together with the said place, gave him all the goods that were\r\ntherein, with the lands and men, he instructed all the people in the faith\r\nof Christ, and cleansed them in the water of Baptism. Among whom were two\r\nhundred and fifty bondsmen and bondswomen, all of whom he saved by Baptism\r\nfrom slavery to the Devil, and in like manner, by giving them their\r\nliberty, set them free from slavery to man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XIV. How a pestilence ceased through the intercession of King\r\nOswald. [681-686 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this monastery, at that time, certain special manifestations of the\r\nheavenly grace are said to have been shown forth; in as much as the\r\ntyranny of the Devil had been recently cast out and Christ had begun to\r\nreign there. Of these I have thought it proper to perpetuate the memory of\r\none which the most reverend Bishop Acca(626) was wont often to relate to\r\nme, affirming that it had been told him by most creditable brothers of the\r\nsame monastery. About the same time that this province had received the\r\nfaith of Christ, a grievous pestilence fell upon many provinces of\r\nBritain; which, also, by the Divine dispensation, reached to the aforesaid\r\nmonastery, then governed by the most religious priest of Christ,\r\nEappa;(627) and many, as well of those that had come thither with the\r\nbishop, as of those of the same province of the South Saxons who had been\r\nlately called to the faith, were snatched away out of this world. The\r\nbrethren, therefore, thought fit to keep a fast of three days, and humbly\r\nto implore the Divine goodness to vouchsafe to have mercy on them, either\r\nby delivering from instant death those that were in danger by reason of\r\nthe disease, or by saving those who were hurried out of this life from the\r\neternal damnation of their souls.\r\n\r\nThere was at that time in the monastery, a little boy, of the Saxon\r\nnation, lately called to the faith, who had been attacked by the same\r\ninfirmity, and had long kept his bed. On the second day of the aforesaid\r\nfasting and prayer, it happened about the second hour of the day, that\r\nthis boy was left alone in the place where he lay sick, when on a sudden,\r\nthrough the Divine disposition, the most blessed chiefs of the Apostles\r\nvouchsafed to appear to him; for he was a boy of a very simple and gentle\r\ndisposition, and with sincere devotion observed the mysteries of the faith\r\nwhich he had received. The Apostles therefore, greeting him with loving\r\nwords, said, “My son, fear not death, concerning which thou art troubled;\r\nfor this day we will bring thee to the kingdom of Heaven; but first thou\r\nmust needs wait till the Masses are celebrated, that having received thy\r\nvoyage provision,(628) the Body and Blood of our Lord, and so being set\r\nfree from sickness and death, thou mayest be taken up to the everlasting\r\njoys in Heaven.\r\n\r\n“Call therefore to thee the priest, Eappa, and tell him, that the Lord has\r\nheard your prayers, and has favourably looked upon your devotion and your\r\nfast, and not one more shall die of this plague, either in the monastery\r\nor the lands adjacent to it; but all your people who any where labour\r\nunder this sickness, shall be raised up from their weakness, and restored\r\nto their former health, saving thee alone, who art this day to be\r\ndelivered from death, and to be carried into Heaven, to behold our Lord\r\nChrist, whom thou hast faithfully served. This favour the Divine mercy has\r\nvouchsafed to grant you, through the intercession of the godly King\r\nOswald, beloved of God, who formerly nobly ruled over the nation of the\r\nNorthumbrians, with the authority of a temporal kingdom and the devotion\r\nof Christian piety which leads to the eternal kingdom. For this very day\r\nthat king was killed in body by the infidels in war, and straightway taken\r\nup to Heaven to the everlasting joys of souls, and brought into fellowship\r\nwith the number of the elect. Let them look in their records,(629) wherein\r\nthe burial of the dead is set down, and they will find that he was, this\r\nday, as we have said, taken out of this world. Let them, therefore,\r\ncelebrate Masses in all the oratories of this monastery, either in\r\nthanksgiving because their prayers are heard, or else in memory of the\r\naforesaid King Oswald, who once governed their nation,(630) and therefore\r\nhumbly prayed to the Lord for them, as for converts of his nation; and let\r\nall the brethren assemble in the church, and all communicate in the\r\nheavenly Sacrifices, and so let them cease to fast, and refresh the body\r\nalso with the food that belongs to it.”\r\n\r\nThe boy called the priest, and repeated all these words to him; and the\r\npriest carefully inquired after the habit and form of the men that had\r\nappeared to him. He answered, “Their habit was altogether noble, and their\r\ncountenances most pleasant and beautiful, such as I had never seen before,\r\nnor did I think there could be any men so fair and comely. One of them\r\nindeed was shorn like a clerk, the other had a long beard; and they said\r\nthat one of them was called Peter, the other Paul; and they were the\r\nservants of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, sent by Him from Heaven to\r\nprotect our monastery.” The priest believed what the boy said, and going\r\nthence immediately, looked in his chronicle, and found that King Oswald\r\nhad been killed on that very day. He then called the brethren, ordered\r\ndinner to be provided, Masses to be said, and all of them to communicate\r\nas usual; causing also a part of the same Sacrifice of the Lord’s Oblation\r\nto be carried to the sick boy.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, the boy died, on that same day; and by his death proved\r\nthat the words which he had heard from the Apostles of Christ were true.\r\nAnd this moreover bore witness to the truth of his words, that none\r\nbesides himself, belonging to the same monastery, was taken away at that\r\ntime. And without doubt, by this vision, many that heard of it were\r\nwonderfully excited to implore the Divine mercy in adversity, and to\r\nsubmit to the wholesome remedy of fasting. From that time, the day of\r\ncommemoration of that king and soldier of Christ began to be yearly\r\nhonoured with the celebration of Masses, not only in that monastery, but\r\nin many other places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XV. How King Caedwalla, king of the Gewissae, having slain\r\nEthelwalch, wasted that Province with cruel slaughter and devastation.\r\n[685 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Caedwalla,(631) a young man of great vigour, of the royal\r\nrace of the Gewissae,(632) an exile from his country, came with an army,\r\nslew Ethelwalch,(633) and wasted that province with cruel slaughter and\r\ndevastation; but he was soon expelled by Berthun and Andhun, the king’s\r\nealdormen, who held in succession the government of the province. The\r\nfirst of them was afterwards killed by the same Caedwalla, when he was\r\nking of the Gewissae, and the province was reduced to more grievous\r\nslavery: Ini,(634) likewise, who reigned after Caedwalla, oppressed that\r\ncountry with the like servitude for many years; for which reason, during\r\nall that time, they could have no bishop of their own; but their first\r\nbishop, Wilfrid, having been recalled home, they were subject to the\r\nbishop of the Gewissae, that is, the West Saxons, who were in the city of\r\nVenta.(635)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XVI. How the Isle of Wight received Christian inhabitants, and two\r\nroyal youths of that island were killed immediately after Baptism. [686\r\nA.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Caedwalla had obtained possession of the kingdom of the Gewissae, he\r\ntook also the Isle of Wight, which till then was entirely given over to\r\nidolatry, and by merciless slaughter endeavoured to destroy all the\r\ninhabitants thereof, and to place in their stead people from his own\r\nprovince; binding himself by a vow, though it is said that he was not yet\r\nregenerated in Christ, to give the fourth part of the land and of the\r\nspoil to the Lord, if he took the island. He fulfilled this vow by giving\r\nthe same for the service of the Lord to Bishop Wilfrid, who happened at\r\nthe time to have come thither from his own people.(636) The measure of\r\nthat island, according to the computation of the English, is of twelve\r\nhundred families, wherefore an estate of three hundred families was given\r\nto the Bishop. The part which he received, he committed to one of his\r\nclerks called Bernwin, who was his sister’s son, assigning to him a\r\npriest, whose name was Hiddila, to administer the Word and laver of life\r\nto all that would be saved.\r\n\r\nHere I think it ought not to be omitted that, as the first fruits of those\r\nof that island who believed and were saved, two royal boys, brothers to\r\nArwald, king of the island,(637) were crowned with the special grace of\r\nGod. For when the enemy approached, they made their escape out of the\r\nisland, and crossed over into the neighbouring province of the Jutes.(638)\r\nComing to the place called At the Stone,(639) they thought to be concealed\r\nfrom the victorious king, but they were betrayed and ordered to be killed.\r\nThis being made known to a certain abbot and priest, whose name was\r\nCynibert, who had a monastery not far from there, at a place called\r\nHreutford,(640) that is, the Ford of Reeds, he came to the king, who then\r\nlay in concealment in those parts to be cured of the wounds which he had\r\nreceived whilst he was fighting in the Isle of Wight, and begged of him,\r\nthat if the boys must needs be killed, he might be allowed first to\r\ninstruct them in the mysteries of the Christian faith. The king consented,\r\nand the bishop having taught them the Word of truth, and cleansed them in\r\nthe font of salvation, assured to them their entrance into the kingdom of\r\nHeaven. Then the executioner came, and they joyfully underwent the\r\ntemporal death, through which they did not doubt they were to pass to the\r\nlife of the soul, which is everlasting. Thus, after this manner, when all\r\nthe provinces of Britain had received the faith of Christ, the Isle of\r\nWight also received the same; yet because it was suffering under the\r\naffliction of foreign subjection, no man there received the office or see\r\nof a bishop, before Daniel, who is now bishop of the West Saxons.(641)\r\n\r\nThe island is situated opposite the borders of the South Saxons and the\r\nGewissae, being separated from it by a sea, three miles wide, which is\r\ncalled Solvente.(642) In this sea, the two tides of the ocean, which break\r\nupon Britain all round its coasts from the boundless northern ocean, daily\r\nmeet in conflict beyond the mouth of the river Homelea,(643) which runs\r\ninto the aforesaid sea, through the lands of the Jutes, belonging to the\r\ncountry of the Gewissae; and after this struggle of the tides, they fall\r\nback and return into the ocean whence they come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XVII. Of the Synod held in the plain of Haethfelth, Archbishop\r\nTheodore being president. [680 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this time, Theodore being informed that the faith of the Church at\r\nConstantinople was much perplexed by the heresy of Eutyches,(644) and\r\ndesiring that the Churches of the English, over which he presided, should\r\nremain free from all such taint, convened an assembly of venerable bishops\r\nand many learned men, and diligently inquired into the faith of each. He\r\nfound them all of one mind in the Catholic faith, and this he caused to be\r\ncommitted to writing by the authority of the synod as a memorial, and for\r\nthe instruction of succeeding generations; the beginning of which document\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n“In the name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, under the rule of our\r\nmost pious lords, Egfrid, king of of the Northumbrians, in the tenth year\r\nof his reign, the seventeenth of September, the eighth indiction;\r\nEthelred, king of the Mercians, in the sixth year of his reign; Aldwulf\r\nking of the East Angles, in the seventeenth year of his reign; and\r\nHlothere, king of Kent, in the seventh year of his reign;(645) Theodore,\r\nby the grace of God, archbishop of the island of Britain, and of the city\r\nof Canterbury, being president, and the other venerable bishops of the\r\nisland of Britain sitting with him, the holy Gospels being laid before\r\nthem, at the place which, in the Saxon tongue, is called Haethfelth,(646)\r\nwe conferred together, and set forth the right and orthodox faith, as our\r\nLord Jesus Christ in the flesh delivered the same to His disciples, who\r\nbeheld His Presence and heard His words, and as it is delivered by the\r\ncreed of the holy fathers, and by all holy and universal synods in\r\ngeneral, and by the consent of all approved doctors of the Catholic\r\nChurch. We, therefore, following them, in piety and orthodoxy, and\r\nprofessing accordance with their divinely inspired doctrine, do believe\r\nagreeably to it, and with the holy fathers confess the Father, and Son,\r\nand Holy Ghost, to be properly and truly a Trinity consubstantial in\r\nUnity, and Unity in Trinity, that is, one God in three Subsistences or\r\nconsubstantial persons, of equal glory and honour.”\r\n\r\nAnd after much more of the same sort, appertaining to the confession of\r\nthe right faith, this holy synod added to its document, “We acknowledge\r\nthe five holy and general councils(647) of the blessed fathers acceptable\r\nto God; that is, of the 318 assembled at Nicaea, against the most impious\r\nArius and his tenets; and at Constantinople, of 150, against the madness\r\nof Macedonius and Eudoxius, and their tenets; and at Ephesus, for the\r\nfirst time, of 200, against the most wicked Nestorius, and his tenets; and\r\nat Chalcedon, of 630, against Eutyches and Nestorius, and their tenets;\r\nand again, at Constantinople, in a fifth council, in the time of Justinian\r\nthe younger,(648) against Theodorus, and the epistles of Theodoret and\r\nIbas, and their tenets in opposition to Cyril.” And again a little lower,\r\n“the synod held in the city of Rome, in the time of the blessed Pope\r\nMartin,(649) in the eighth indiction, and in the ninth year of the most\r\npious Emperor Constantine,(650) we also acknowledge. And we glorify our\r\nLord Jesus Christ, as they glorified Him, neither adding aught nor taking\r\naway; anathematizing with hearts and lips those whom they anathematized,\r\nand receiving those whom they received; glorifying God the Father, Who is\r\nwithout beginning, and His only-begotten Son, begotten of the Father\r\nbefore the worlds, and the Holy Ghost proceeding ineffably from the Father\r\nand the Son,(651) even as those holy Apostles, prophets, and doctors, whom\r\nwe have above-mentioned, did declare. And all we, who, with Archbishop\r\nTheodore, have thus set forth the Catholic faith, thereto subscribe.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XVIII. Of John, the precentor of the Apostolic see, who came into\r\nBritain to teach. [680 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong those who were present at this synod, and confirmed the decrees of\r\nthe Catholic faith, was the venerable John,(652) archchanter of the church\r\nof the holy Apostle Peter,(653) and abbot of the monastery of the blessed\r\nMartin, who had come lately from Rome, by order of Pope Agatho, together\r\nwith the most reverend Abbot Biscop, surnamed Benedict,(654) of whom\r\nmention has been made above. For the said Benedict, having built a\r\nmonastery in Britain, in honour of the most blessed chief of the Apostles,\r\nat the mouth of the river Wear, went to Rome with Ceolfrid,(655) his\r\ncompanion and fellow-labourer in that work, who was after him abbot of the\r\nsame monastery; he had been several times before at Rome, and was now\r\nhonourably received by Pope Agatho of blessed memory; from whom he also\r\nasked and obtained, in order to secure the immunities of the monastery\r\nwhich he had founded, a letter of privilege confirmed by apostolic\r\nauthority, according to what he knew to be the will and grant of King\r\nEgfrid, by whose consent and gift of land he had built that monastery.\r\n\r\nHe was also allowed to take the aforesaid Abbot John with him into\r\nBritain, that he might teach in his monastery the system of singing\r\nthroughout the year, as it was practised at St. Peter’s at Rome.(656) The\r\nAbbot John did as he had been commanded by the Pope, teaching the singers\r\nof the said monastery the order and manner of singing and reading aloud,\r\nand committing to writing all that was requisite throughout the whole\r\ncourse of the year for the celebration of festivals; and these writings\r\nare still preserved in that monastery, and have been copied by many others\r\nelsewhere. The said John not only taught the brothers of that monastery,\r\nbut such as had skill in singing resorted from almost all the monasteries\r\nof the same province to hear him, and many invited him to teach in other\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nBesides his task of singing and reading, he had also received a commission\r\nfrom the Apostolic Pope, carefully to inform himself concerning the faith\r\nof the English Church, and to give an account thereof on his return to\r\nRome. For he also brought with him the decision of the synod of the\r\nblessed Pope Martin, held not long before at Rome,(657) with the consent\r\nof one hundred and five bishops, chiefly to refute those who taught that\r\nthere is but one operation and will in Christ, and he gave it to be\r\ntranscribed in the aforesaid monastery of the most religious Abbot\r\nBenedict. The men who followed such opinion greatly perplexed the faith of\r\nthe Church of Constantinople at that time; but by the help of God they\r\nwere then discovered and overcome.(658) Wherefore, Pope Agatho, being\r\ndesirous to be informed concerning the state of the Church in Britain, as\r\nwell as in other provinces, and to what extent it was clear from the\r\ncontagion of heretics, gave this matter in charge to the most reverend\r\nAbbot John, then appointed to go to Britain. The synod we have spoken of\r\nhaving been called for this purpose in Britain, the Catholic faith was\r\nfound untainted in all, and a report of the proceedings of the same was\r\ngiven him to carry to Rome.\r\n\r\nBut in his return to his own country, soon after crossing the sea, he fell\r\nsick and died; and his body, for the sake of St. Martin, in whose\r\nmonastery he presided, was by his friends carried to Tours,(659) and\r\nhonourably buried; for he had been kindly entertained by the Church there\r\non his way to Britain, and earnestly entreated by the brethren, that in\r\nhis return to Rome he would take that road, and visit their Church, and\r\nmoreover he was there supplied with men to conduct him on his way, and\r\nassist him in the work enjoined upon him. Though he died by the way, yet\r\nthe testimony of the Catholic faith of the English nation was carried to\r\nRome, and received with great joy by the Apostolic Pope, and all those\r\nthat heard or read it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XIX. How Queen Ethelthryth always preserved her virginity, and her\r\nbody suffered no corruption in the grave. [660-696 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Egfrid took to wife Ethelthryth, the daughter of Anna,(660) king of\r\nthe East Angles, of whom mention has been often made; a man of true\r\nreligion, and altogether noble in mind and deed. She had before been given\r\nin marriage to another, to wit, Tondbert, ealdorman(661) of the Southern\r\nGyrwas; but he died soon after he had married her, and she was given to\r\nthe aforesaid king. Though she lived with him twelve years, yet she\r\npreserved the glory of perfect virginity, as I was informed by Bishop\r\nWilfrid, of blessed memory, of whom I inquired, because some questioned\r\nthe truth thereof; and he told me that he was an undoubted witness to her\r\nvirginity, forasmuch as Egfrid promised to give him many lands and much\r\nmoney if he could persuade the queen to consent to fulfil her marriage\r\nduty, for he knew the queen loved no man more than himself. And it is not\r\nto be doubted that this might take place in our age, which true histories\r\ntell us happened sometimes in former ages, by the help of the same Lord\r\nwho promises to abide with us always, even unto the end of the world. For\r\nthe divine miracle whereby her flesh, being buried, could not suffer\r\ncorruption, is a token that she had not been defiled by man.\r\n\r\nShe had long asked of the king that he would permit her to lay aside\r\nworldly cares, and to serve only Christ, the true King, in a monastery;\r\nand having at length with difficulty prevailed, she entered the monastery\r\nof the Abbess Aebba,(662) who was aunt to King Egfrid, at the place called\r\nthe city of Coludi,(663) having received the veil of the religious habit\r\nfrom the hands of the aforesaid Bishop Wilfrid; but a year after she was\r\nherself made abbess in the district called Elge,(664) where, having built\r\na monastery, she began, by the example of a heavenly life and by her\r\nteaching, to be the virgin mother of many virgins dedicated to God. It is\r\ntold of her that from the time of her entering the monastery, she would\r\nnever wear any linen but only woollen garments, and would seldom wash in a\r\nhot bath, unless just before the greater festivals, as Easter,\r\nWhitsuntide, and the Epiphany, and then she did it last of all, when the\r\nother handmaids of Christ who were there had been washed, served by her\r\nand her attendants. She seldom ate more than once a day, excepting on the\r\ngreater festivals, or some urgent occasion. Always, except when grievous\r\nsickness prevented her, from the time of matins till day-break, she\r\ncontinued in the church at prayer. Some also say, that by the spirit of\r\nprophecy she not only foretold the pestilence of which she was to die, but\r\nalso, in the presence of all, revealed the number of those that should be\r\nthen snatched away from this world out of her monastery. She was taken to\r\nthe Lord, in the midst of her flock, seven years after she had been made\r\nabbess; and, as she had ordered, was buried among them in a wooden coffin\r\nin her turn, according to the order in which she had passed away.\r\n\r\nShe was succeeded in the office of abbess by her sister Sexburg,(665) who\r\nhad been wife to Earconbert, king of Kent. This abbess, when her sister\r\nhad been buried sixteen years, thought fit to take up her bones, and,\r\nputting them into a new coffin, to translate them into the church.\r\nAccordingly she ordered some of the brothers to find a stone whereof to\r\nmake a coffin for this purpose. They went on board ship, for the district\r\nof Ely is on every side encompassed with water and marshes, and has no\r\nlarge stones, and came to a small deserted city, not far from thence,\r\nwhich, in the language of the English, is called Grantacaestir,(666) and\r\npresently, near the city walls, they found a white marble coffin,(667)\r\nmost beautifully wrought, and fitly covered with a lid of the same sort of\r\nstone. Perceiving, therefore, that the Lord had prospered their journey,\r\nthey returned thanks to Him and carried it to the monastery.\r\n\r\nWhen the grave was opened and the body of the holy virgin and bride of\r\nChrist was brought into the light of day, it was found as free from\r\ncorruption as if she had died and been buried on that very day; as the\r\naforesaid Bishop Wilfrid, and many others that know it, testify. But the\r\nphysician, Cynifrid, who was present at her death, and when she was taken\r\nup out of the grave, had more certain knowledge. He was wont to relate\r\nthat in her sickness she had a very great tumour under her jaw. “And I was\r\nordered,” said he, “to lay open that tumour to let out the noxious matter\r\nin it, which I did, and she seemed to be somewhat more easy for two days,\r\nso that many thought she might recover from her infirmity; but on the\r\nthird day she was attacked by the former pains, and being soon snatched\r\nout of the world, she exchanged all pain and death for everlasting life\r\nand health. And when, so many years after, her bones were to be taken out\r\nof the grave, a pavilion being spread over it, and all the congregation,\r\nthe brothers on the one side, and the sisters on the other, standing about\r\nit singing, while the abbess, with a few others, had gone within to take\r\nup and wash the bones, on a sudden we heard the abbess within cry out with\r\na loud voice, ‘Glory be to the name of the Lord.’ Not long after they\r\ncalled me in, opening the door of the pavilion, and I found the body of\r\nthe holy virgin taken out of the grave and laid on a bed, like one asleep;\r\nthen taking off the veil from the face, they also showed me that the\r\nincision which I had made was healed up; so that, in marvellous wise,\r\ninstead of the open gaping wound with which she had been buried, there\r\nthen appeared only the slightest trace of a scar. Besides, all the linen\r\nclothes in which the body had been wrapped, appeared entire and as fresh\r\nas if they had been that very day put about her chaste limbs.”\r\n\r\nIt is said that when she was sore troubled with the aforesaid tumour and\r\npain in her jaw and neck, she took great pleasure in that sort of\r\nsickness, and was wont to say, “I know of a surety that I deservedly bear\r\nthe weight of my trouble on my neck, for I remember that, when I was a\r\nyoung maiden, I bore on it the needless weight of necklaces;(668) and\r\ntherefore I believe the Divine goodness would have me endure the pain in\r\nmy neck, that so I may be absolved from the guilt of my needless levity,\r\nhaving now, instead of gold and pearls, the fiery heat of a tumour rising\r\non my neck.” It happened also that by the touch of those same linen\r\nclothes devils were expelled from bodies possessed, and other diseases\r\nwere at divers times healed; and the coffin wherein she was first buried\r\nis said to have cured some of infirmities of the eyes, who, praying with\r\ntheir heads resting upon that coffin, were presently relieved of the pain\r\nor dimness in their eyes. So they washed the virgin’s body, and having\r\nclothed it in new garments, brought it into the church, and laid it in the\r\nsarcophagus that had been brought, where it is held in great veneration to\r\nthis day. The sarcophagus was found in a wonderful manner to fit the\r\nvirgin’s body as if it had been made purposely for her, and the place for\r\nthe head, which was fashioned separately, appeared exactly shaped to the\r\nmeasurement of her head.\r\n\r\nElge is in the province of the East Angles, a district of about six\r\nhundred families, of the nature of an island, encompassed, as has been\r\nsaid, with marshes or waters, and therefore it has its name from the great\r\nplenty of eels taken in those marshes; there the aforesaid handmaid of\r\nChrist desired to have a monastery, because, as we have before mentioned,\r\nshe came, according to the flesh, of that same province of the East\r\nAngles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XX. A Hymn concerning her.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems fitting to insert in this history a hymn concerning virginity,\r\nwhich we composed in elegiac verse many years ago, in praise and honour of\r\nthe same queen and bride of Christ, and therefore truly a queen, because\r\nthe bride of Christ; and to imitate the method of Holy Scripture, wherein\r\nmany songs are inserted in the history, and these, as is well known, are\r\ncomposed in metre and verse.\r\n\r\n“Trinity,(669) Gracious, Divine, Who rulest all the ages; favour my task,\r\nTrinity, Gracious, Divine.\r\n\r\n“Let Maro sound the trumpet of war, let us sing the gifts of peace; the\r\ngifts of Christ we sing, let Maro sound the trumpet of war.\r\n\r\n“Chaste is my song, no rape of guilty Helen; light tales shall be told by\r\nthe wanton, chaste is my song.\r\n\r\n“I will tell of gifts from Heaven, not wars of hapless Troy; I will tell\r\nof gifts from Heaven, wherein the earth is glad.\r\n\r\n“Lo! the high God comes to the womb of a holy virgin, to be the Saviour of\r\nmen, lo! the high God comes.\r\n\r\n“A hallowed maid gives birth to Him Who gave the world its being; Mary,\r\nthe gate of God, a maiden gives Him birth.\r\n\r\n“The company of her fellows rejoices over the Virgin Mother of Him Who\r\nwields the thunder; a shining virgin band, the company of her fellows\r\nrejoices.\r\n\r\n“Her honour has made many a blossom to spring from that pure shoot, virgin\r\nblossoms her honour has made to spring.\r\n\r\n“Scorched by the fierce flames, the maiden Agatha(670) yielded not; in\r\nlike manner Eulalia endures, scorched by the fierce flames.\r\n\r\n“The lofty soul of chaste Tecla overcomes the wild beasts; chaste Euphemia\r\novercomes the accursed wild beasts.\r\n\r\n“Agnes joyously laughs at the sword, herself stronger than steel, Cecilia\r\njoyously laughs at the foemen’s sword.\r\n\r\n“Many a triumph is mighty throughout the world in temperate hearts;\r\nthroughout the world love of the temperate life is mighty.\r\n\r\n“Yea, and our day likewise a peerless maiden has blessed; peerless our\r\nEthelthryth shines.\r\n\r\n“Child of a noble sire, and glorious by royal birth, more noble in her\r\nLord’s sight, the child of a noble sire.\r\n\r\n“Thence she receives queenly honour and a sceptre in this world; thence\r\nshe receives honour, awaiting higher honour above.\r\n\r\n“What need, gracious lady, to seek an earthly lord, even now given to the\r\nHeavenly Bridegroom?\r\n\r\n“Christ is at hand, the Bridegroom (why seek an earthly lord?) that thou\r\nmayst follow even now, methinks, in the steps of the Mother of Heaven’s\r\nKing, that thou too mayst be a mother in God.\r\n\r\n“Twelve years(671) she had reigned, a bride dedicated to God, then in the\r\ncloister dwelt, a bride dedicated to God.\r\n\r\n“To Heaven all consecrated she lived, abounding in lofty deeds, then to\r\nHeaven all consecrated she gave up her soul.\r\n\r\n“Twice eight Novembers(672) the maid’s fair flesh lay in the tomb, nor did\r\nthe maid’s fair flesh see corruption in the tomb.\r\n\r\n“This was Thy work, O Christ, that her very garments were bright and\r\nundefiled even in the grave; O Christ, this was Thy work.\r\n\r\n“The dark serpent(673) flies before the honour due to the holy raiment;\r\ndisease is driven away, and the dark serpent flies.\r\n\r\n“Rage fills the foe who of old conquered Eve; exultant the maiden triumphs\r\nand rage fills the foe.\r\n\r\n“Behold, O bride of God, thy glory upon earth; the glory that awaits thee\r\nin the Heavens behold, O bride of God.\r\n\r\n“In gladness thou receivest gifts, bright amidst the festal torches;\r\nbehold! the Bridegroom comes, in gladness thou receivest gifts.\r\n\r\n“And a new song thou singest to the tuneful harp; a new-made bride, thou\r\nexultest in the tuneful hymn.\r\n\r\n“None can part her from them which follow the Lamb enthroned on high, whom\r\nnone had severed from the Love enthroned on high.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXI. How Bishop Theodore made peace between the kings Egfrid and\r\nEthelred. [679 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the ninth year of the reign of King Egfrid, a great battle(674) was\r\nfought between him and Ethelred, king of the Mercians, near the river\r\nTrent, and Aelfwine,(675) brother to King Egfrid, was slain, a youth about\r\neighteen years of age, and much beloved by both provinces; for King\r\nEthelred had married his sister Osthryth.(676) There was now reason to\r\nexpect a more bloody war, and more lasting enmity between those kings and\r\ntheir fierce nations; but Theodore, the bishop, beloved of God, relying on\r\nthe Divine aid, by his wholesome admonitions wholly extinguished the\r\ndangerous fire that was breaking out; so that the kings and their people\r\non both sides were appeased, and no man was put to death, but only the due\r\nmulct(677) paid to the king who was the avenger for the death of his\r\nbrother; and this peace continued long after between those kings and\r\nbetween their kingdoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXII. How a certain captive’s chains fell off when Masses were sung\r\nfor him. [679 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the aforesaid battle, wherein King Aelfwine was killed, a memorable\r\nincident is known to have happened, which I think ought by no means to be\r\npassed over in silence; for the story will be profitable to the salvation\r\nof many. In that battle a youth called Imma, one of the king’s thegns, was\r\nstruck down, and having lain as if dead all that day and the next night\r\namong the bodies of the slain, at length he came to himself and revived,\r\nand sitting up, bound his own wounds as best as he could. Then having\r\nrested awhile, he stood up, and went away to see if he could find any\r\nfriends to take care of him; but in so doing he was discovered and taken\r\nby some of the enemy’s army, and carried before their lord, who was one of\r\nKing Ethelred’s nobles.(678) Being asked by him who he was, and fearing to\r\nown himself a thegn, he answered that he was a peasant, a poor man and\r\nmarried, and he declared that he had come to the war with others like\r\nhimself to bring provisions to the army. The noble entertained him, and\r\nordered his wounds to be dressed, and when he began to recover, to prevent\r\nhis escaping, he ordered him to be bound at night. But he could not be\r\nbound, for as soon as they that bound him were gone, his bonds were\r\nloosed.\r\n\r\nNow he had a brother called Tunna, who was a priest and abbot of a\r\nmonastery in the city which is still called Tunnacaestir after him.(679)\r\nThis man, hearing that his brother had been killed in the battle, went to\r\nsee if haply he could find his body; and finding another very like him in\r\nall respects, he believed it to be his. So he carried it to his monastery,\r\nand buried it honourably, and took care often to say Masses for the\r\nabsolution of his soul; the celebration whereof occasioned what I have\r\nsaid, that none could bind him but he was presently loosed again. In the\r\nmeantime, the noble that had kept him was amazed, and began to inquire why\r\nhe could not be bound; whether perchance he had any spells about him, such\r\nas are spoken of in stories. He answered that he knew nothing of those\r\narts; “but I have,” said he, “a brother who is a priest in my country, and\r\nI know that he, supposing me to be killed, is saying frequent Masses for\r\nme; and if I were now in the other life, my soul there, through his\r\nintercession, would be delivered from penalty.”\r\n\r\nWhen he had been a prisoner with the noble some time, those who\r\nattentively observed him, by his countenance, habit, and discourse, took\r\nnotice, that he was not of the meaner sort, as he had said, but of some\r\nquality. The noble then privately sending for him, straitly questioned\r\nhim, whence he came, promising to do him no harm on that account if he\r\nwould frankly confess who he was. This he did, declaring that he had been\r\na thegn of the king’s, and the noble answered, “I perceived by all your\r\nanswers that you were no peasant. And now you deserve to die, because all\r\nmy brothers and relations were killed in that fight; yet I will not put\r\nyou to death, that I may not break my promise.”\r\n\r\nAs soon, therefore, as he was recovered, he sold him to a certain Frisian\r\nat London, but he could not in any wise be bound either by him, or as he\r\nwas being led thither. But when his enemies had put all manner of bonds on\r\nhim, and the buyer perceived that he could in no way be bound, he gave him\r\nleave to ransom himself if he could. Now it was at the third hour, when\r\nthe Masses were wont to be said, that his bonds were most frequently\r\nloosed. He, having taken an oath that he would either return, or send his\r\nowner the money for the ransom, went into Kent to King Hlothere, who was\r\nson to the sister of Queen Ethelthryth,(680) above spoken of, for he had\r\nonce been that queen’s thegn. From him he asked and obtained the price of\r\nhis freedom, and as he had promised, sent it to his master for his ransom.\r\n\r\nReturning afterwards into his own country, and coming to his brother, he\r\ngave him an exact account of all his misfortunes, and the consolation\r\nafforded to him in them; and from what his brother told him he understood,\r\nthat his bonds had been generally loosed at those times when Masses had\r\nbeen celebrated for him; and he perceived that other advantages and\r\nblessings which had fallen to his lot in his time of danger, had been\r\nconferred on him from Heaven, through the intercession of his brother, and\r\nthe Oblation of the saving Sacrifice. Many, on hearing this account from\r\nthe aforesaid man, were stirred up in faith and pious devotion to prayer,\r\nor to alms-giving, or to make an offering to God of the Sacrifice of the\r\nholy Oblation, for the deliverance of their friends who had departed this\r\nworld; for they knew that such saving Sacrifice availed for the eternal\r\nredemption both of body and soul. This story was also told me by some of\r\nthose who had heard it related by the man himself to whom it happened;\r\ntherefore, since I had a clear understanding of it, I have not hesitated\r\nto insert it in my Ecclesiastical History.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXIII. Of the life and death of the Abbess Hilda. [614-680 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year after this, that is the year of our Lord 680, the most\r\nreligious handmaid of Christ, Hilda,(681) abbess of the monastery that is\r\ncalled Streanaeshalch,(682) as we mentioned above, after having done many\r\nheavenly deeds on earth, passed thence to receive the rewards of the\r\nheavenly life, on the 17th of November, at the age of sixty-six years. Her\r\nlife falls into two equal parts, for the first thirty-three years of it\r\nshe spent living most nobly in the secular habit; and still more nobly\r\ndedicated the remaining half to the Lord in the monastic life. For she was\r\nnobly born, being the daughter of Hereric,(683) nephew to King Edwin, and\r\nwith that king she also received the faith and mysteries of Christ, at the\r\npreaching of Paulinus, of blessed memory,(684) the first bishop of the\r\nNorthumbrians, and preserved the same undefiled till she attained to the\r\nvision of our Lord in Heaven.\r\n\r\nWhen she had resolved to quit the secular habit, and to serve Him alone,\r\nshe withdrew into the province of the East Angles, for she was allied to\r\nthe king there;(685) being desirous to cross over thence into Gaul,\r\nforsaking her native country and all that she had, and so to live a\r\nstranger for our Lord’s sake in the monastery of Cale,(686) that she might\r\nthe better attain to the eternal country in heaven. For her sister\r\nHeresuid, mother to Aldwulf,(687) king of the East Angles, was at that\r\ntime living in the same monastery, under regular discipline, waiting for\r\nan everlasting crown; and led by her example, she continued a whole year\r\nin the aforesaid province, with the design of going abroad; but\r\nafterwards, Bishop Aidan recalled her to her home, and she received land\r\nto the extent of one family on the north side of the river Wear;(688)\r\nwhere likewise for a year she led a monastic life, with very few\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nAfter this she was made abbess in the monastery called Heruteu,(689) which\r\nmonastery had been founded, not long before, by the pious handmaid of\r\nChrist, Heiu,(690) who is said to have been the first woman in the\r\nprovince of the Northumbrians who took upon her the vows and habit of a\r\nnun, being consecrated by Bishop Aidan; but she, soon after she had\r\nfounded that monastery, retired to the city of Calcaria,(691) which is\r\ncalled Kaelcacaestir by the English, and there fixed her dwelling. Hilda,\r\nthe handmaid of Christ, being set over that monastery, began immediately\r\nto order it in all things under a rule of life, according as she had been\r\ninstructed by learned men; for Bishop Aidan, and others of the religious\r\nthat knew her, frequently visited her and loved her heartily, and\r\ndiligently instructed her, because of her innate wisdom and love of the\r\nservice of God.\r\n\r\nWhen she had for some years governed this monastery, wholly intent upon\r\nestablishing a rule of life, it happened that she also undertook either to\r\nbuild or to set in order a monastery in the place called Streanaeshalch,\r\nand this work which was laid upon her she industriously performed; for she\r\nput this monastery under the same rule of monastic life as the former; and\r\ntaught there the strict observance of justice, piety, chastity, and other\r\nvirtues, and particularly of peace and charity; so that, after the example\r\nof the primitive Church, no one there was rich, and none poor, for they\r\nhad all things common, and none had any private property. Her prudence was\r\nso great, that not only meaner men in their need, but sometimes even kings\r\nand princes, sought and received her counsel; she obliged those who were\r\nunder her direction to give so much time to reading of the Holy\r\nScriptures, and to exercise themselves so much in works of justice, that\r\nmany might readily be found there fit for the priesthood and the service\r\nof the altar.\r\n\r\nIndeed we have seen five from that monastery who afterwards became\r\nbishops, and all of them men of singular merit and sanctity, whose names\r\nwere Bosa,(692) Aetla,(693) Oftfor,(694) John,(695) and Wilfrid.(696) Of\r\nthe first we have said above that he was consecrated bishop of York; of\r\nthe second, it may be briefly stated that he was appointed bishop of\r\nDorchester. Of the last two we shall tell hereafter, that the former was\r\nordained bishop of Hagustald, the other of the church of York; of the\r\nthird, we may here mention that, having applied himself to the reading and\r\nobservance of the Scriptures in both the monasteries of the Abbess\r\nHilda,(697) at length being desirous to attain to greater perfection, he\r\nwent into Kent, to Archbishop Theodore, of blessed memory; where having\r\nspent some time in sacred studies, he resolved to go to Rome also, which,\r\nin those days, was esteemed a very salutary undertaking. Returning thence\r\ninto Britain, he took his way into the province of the Hwiccas,(698) where\r\nKing Osric then ruled,(699) and continued there a long time, preaching the\r\nWord of faith, and showing an example of good life to all that saw and\r\nheard him. At that time, Bosel, the bishop of that province,(700) laboured\r\nunder such weakness of body, that he could not himself perform episcopal\r\nfunctions; for which reason, Oftfor was, by universal consent, chosen\r\nbishop in his stead, and by order of King Ethelred,(701) consecrated by\r\nBishop Wilfrid,(702) of blessed memory, who was then Bishop of the Midland\r\nAngles, because Archbishop Theodore was dead, and no other bishop ordained\r\nin his place. A little while before, that is, before the election of the\r\naforesaid man of God, Bosel, Tatfrid,(703) a man of great industry and\r\nlearning, and of excellent ability, had been chosen bishop for that\r\nprovince, from the monastery of the same abbess, but had been snatched\r\naway by an untimely death, before he could be ordained.\r\n\r\nThus this handmaid of Christ, the Abbess Hilda, whom all that knew her\r\ncalled Mother, for her singular piety and grace, was not only an example\r\nof good life, to those that lived in her monastery, but afforded occasion\r\nof amendment and salvation to many who lived at a distance, to whom the\r\nblessed fame was brought of her industry and virtue. For it was meet that\r\nthe dream of her mother, Bregusuid, during her infancy, should be\r\nfulfilled. Now Bregusuid, at the time that her husband, Hereric, lived in\r\nbanishment, under Cerdic,(704) king of the Britons, where he was also\r\npoisoned, fancied, in a dream, that he was suddenly taken away from her\r\nand she was seeking for him most carefully, but could find no sign of him\r\nanywhere. After an anxious search for him, all at once she found a most\r\nprecious necklace under her garment, and whilst she was looking on it very\r\nattentively, it seemed to shine forth with such a blaze of light that it\r\nfilled all Britain with the glory of its brilliance. This dream was\r\ndoubtless fulfilled in her daughter that we speak of, whose life was an\r\nexample of the works of light, not only blessed to herself, but to many\r\nwho desired to live aright.\r\n\r\nWhen she had governed this monastery many years, it pleased Him Who has\r\nmade such merciful provision for our salvation, to give her holy soul the\r\ntrial of a long infirmity of the flesh, to the end that, according to the\r\nApostle’s example, her virtue might be made perfect in weakness. Struck\r\ndown with a fever, she suffered from a burning heat, and was afflicted\r\nwith the same trouble for six years continually; during all which time she\r\nnever failed either to return thanks to her Maker, or publicly and\r\nprivately to instruct the flock committed to her charge; for taught by her\r\nown experience she admonished all men to serve the Lord dutifully, when\r\nhealth of body is granted to them, and always to return thanks faithfully\r\nto Him in adversity, or bodily infirmity. In the seventh year of her\r\nsickness, when the disease turned inwards, her last day came, and about\r\ncockcrow, having received the voyage provision(705) of Holy Housel, and\r\ncalled together the handmaids of Christ that were within the same\r\nmonastery, she admonished them to preserve the peace of the Gospel among\r\nthemselves, and with all others; and even as she spoke her words of\r\nexhortation, she joyfully saw death come, or, in the words of our Lord,\r\npassed from death unto life.\r\n\r\nThat same night it pleased Almighty God, by a manifest vision, to make\r\nknown her death in another monastery, at a distance from hers, which she\r\nhad built that same year, and which is called Hacanos.(706) There was in\r\nthat monastery, a certain nun called Begu,(707) who, having dedicated her\r\nvirginity to the Lord, had served Him upwards of thirty years in the\r\nmonastic life. This nun was resting in the dormitory of the sisters, when\r\non a sudden she heard in the air the well-known sound of the bell, which\r\nused to awake and call them to prayers, when any one of them was taken out\r\nof this world, and opening her eyes, as she thought, she saw the roof of\r\nthe house open, and a light shed from above filling all the place. Looking\r\nearnestly upon that light, she saw the soul of the aforesaid handmaid of\r\nGod in that same light, being carried to heaven attended and guided by\r\nangels. Then awaking, and seeing the other sisters lying round about her,\r\nshe perceived that what she had seen had been revealed to her either in a\r\ndream or a vision; and rising immediately in great fear, she ran to the\r\nvirgin who then presided in the monastery in the place of the abbess,(708)\r\nand whose name was Frigyth, and, with many tears and lamentations, and\r\nheaving deep sighs, told her that the Abbess Hilda, mother of them all,\r\nhad departed this life, and had in her sight ascended to the gates of\r\neternal light, and to the company of the citizens of heaven, with a great\r\nlight, and with angels for her guides. Frigyth having heard it, awoke all\r\nthe sisters, and calling them to the church, admonished them to give\r\nthemselves to prayer and singing of psalms, for the soul of their mother;\r\nwhich they did earnestly during the remainder of the night; and at break\r\nof day, the brothers came with news of her death, from the place where she\r\nhad died. They answered that they knew it before, and then related in\r\norder how and when they had learnt it, by which it appeared that her death\r\nhad been revealed to them in a vision that same hour in which the brothers\r\nsaid that she had died. Thus by a fair harmony of events Heaven ordained,\r\nthat when some saw her departure out of this world, the others should have\r\nknowledge of her entrance into the eternal life of souls. These\r\nmonasteries are about thirteen miles distant from each other.\r\n\r\nIt is also told, that her death was, in a vision, made known the same\r\nnight to one of the virgins dedicated to God, who loved her with a great\r\nlove, in the same monastery where the said handmaid of God died. This nun\r\nsaw her soul ascend to heaven in the company of angels; and this she\r\nopenly declared, in the very same hour that it happened, to those\r\nhandmaids of Christ that were with her; and aroused them to pray for her\r\nsoul, even before the rest of the community had heard of her death. The\r\ntruth of which was known to the whole community in the morning. This same\r\nnun was at that time with some other handmaids of Christ, in the remotest\r\npart of the monastery, where the women who had lately entered the monastic\r\nlife were wont to pass their time of probation, till they were instructed\r\naccording to rule, and admitted into the fellowship of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXIV. That there was in her monastery a brother, on whom the gift of\r\nsong was bestowed by Heaven.(709) [680 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was in the monastery of this abbess a certain brother, marked in a\r\nspecial manner by the grace of God, for he was wont to make songs of piety\r\nand religion, so that whatever was expounded to him out of Scripture, he\r\nturned ere long into verse expressive of much sweetness and penitence, in\r\nEnglish, which was his native language. By his songs the minds of many\r\nwere often fired with contempt of the world, and desire of the heavenly\r\nlife. Others of the English nation after him attempted to compose\r\nreligious poems, but none could equal him, for he did not learn the art of\r\npoetry from men, neither was he taught by man, but by God’s grace he\r\nreceived the free gift of song, for which reason he never could compose\r\nany trivial or vain poem, but only those which concern religion it behoved\r\nhis religious tongue to utter. For having lived in the secular habit till\r\nhe was well advanced in years, he had never learned anything of\r\nversifying; and for this reason sometimes at a banquet, when it was agreed\r\nto make merry by singing in turn, if he saw the harp come towards him, he\r\nwould rise up from table and go out and return home.\r\n\r\nOnce having done so and gone out of the house where the banquet was, to\r\nthe stable, where he had to take care of the cattle that night, he there\r\ncomposed himself to rest at the proper time. Thereupon one stood by him in\r\nhis sleep, and saluting him, and calling him by his name, said, “Cædmon,\r\nsing me something.” But he answered, “I cannot sing, and for this cause I\r\nleft the banquet and retired hither, because I could not sing.” Then he\r\nwho talked to him replied, “Nevertheless thou must needs sing to me.”\r\n“What must I sing?” he asked. “Sing the beginning of creation,” said the\r\nother. Having received this answer he straightway began to sing verses to\r\nthe praise of God the Creator, which he had never heard, the purport\r\nwhereof was after this manner: “Now must we praise the Maker of the\r\nheavenly kingdom, the power of the Creator and His counsel, the deeds of\r\nthe Father of glory. How He, being the eternal God, became the Author of\r\nall wondrous works, Who being the Almighty Guardian of the human race,\r\nfirst created heaven for the sons of men to be the covering of their\r\ndwelling place, and next the earth.” This is the sense but not the order\r\nof the words as he sang them in his sleep; for verses, though never so\r\nwell composed, cannot be literally translated out of one language into\r\nanother without loss of their beauty and loftiness. Awaking from his\r\nsleep, he remembered all that he had sung in his dream, and soon added\r\nmore after the same manner, in words which worthily expressed the praise\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nIn the morning he came to the reeve(710) who was over him, and having told\r\nhim of the gift he had received, was conducted to the abbess, and bidden,\r\nin the presence of many learned men, to tell his dream, and repeat the\r\nverses, that they might all examine and give their judgement upon the\r\nnature and origin of the gift whereof he spoke. And they all judged that\r\nheavenly grace had been granted to him by the Lord. They expounded to him\r\na passage of sacred history or doctrine, enjoining upon him, if he could,\r\nto put it into verse. Having undertaken this task, he went away, and\r\nreturning the next morning, gave them the passage he had been bidden to\r\ntranslate, rendered in most excellent verse. Whereupon the abbess,\r\njoyfully recognizing the grace of God in the man, instructed him to quit\r\nthe secular habit, and take upon him monastic vows; and having received\r\nhim into the monastery, she and all her people admitted him to the company\r\nof the brethren, and ordered that he should be taught the whole course of\r\nsacred history. So he, giving ear to all that he could learn, and bearing\r\nit in mind, and as it were ruminating, like a clean animal,(711) turned it\r\ninto most harmonious verse; and sweetly singing it, made his masters in\r\ntheir turn his hearers. He sang the creation of the world, the origin of\r\nman, and all the history of Genesis, the departure of the children of\r\nIsrael out of Egypt, their entrance into the promised land, and many other\r\nhistories from Holy Scripture; the Incarnation, Passion, Resurrection of\r\nour Lord, and His Ascension into heaven; the coming of the Holy Ghost, and\r\nthe teaching of the Apostles; likewise he made many songs concerning the\r\nterror of future judgement, the horror of the pains of hell, and the joys\r\nof heaven; besides many more about the blessings and the judgements of\r\nGod, by all of which he endeavoured to draw men away from the love of sin,\r\nand to excite in them devotion to well-doing and perseverance therein. For\r\nhe was a very religious man, humbly submissive to the discipline of\r\nmonastic rule, but inflamed with fervent zeal against those who chose to\r\ndo otherwise; for which reason he made a fair ending of his life.\r\n\r\nFor when the hour of his departure drew near, it was preceded by a bodily\r\ninfirmity under which he laboured for the space of fourteen days, yet it\r\nwas of so mild a nature that he could talk and go about the whole time. In\r\nhis neighbourhood was the house to which those that were sick, and like to\r\ndie, were wont to be carried. He desired the person that ministered to\r\nhim, as the evening came on of the night in which he was to depart this\r\nlife, to make ready a place there for him to take his rest. The man,\r\nwondering why he should desire it, because there was as yet no sign of his\r\napproaching death, nevertheless did his bidding. When they had lain down\r\nthere, and had been conversing happily and pleasantly for some time with\r\nthose that were in the house before, and it was now past midnight, he\r\nasked them, whether they had the Eucharist within?(712) They answered,\r\n“What need of the Eucharist? for you are not yet appointed to die, since\r\nyou talk so merrily with us, as if you were in good health.”\r\n“Nevertheless,” said he, “bring me the Eucharist.” Having received It into\r\nhis hand, he asked, whether they were all in charity with him, and had no\r\ncomplaint against him, nor any quarrel or grudge. They answered, that they\r\nwere all in perfect charity with him, and free from all anger; and in\r\ntheir turn they asked him to be of the same mind towards them. He answered\r\nat once, “I am in charity, my children, with all the servants of God.”\r\nThen strengthening himself with the heavenly Viaticum, he prepared for the\r\nentrance into another life, and asked how near the time was when the\r\nbrothers should be awakened to sing the nightly praises of the Lord?(713)\r\nThey answered, “It is not far off.” Then he said, “It is well, let us\r\nawait that hour;” and signing himself with the sign of the Holy Cross, he\r\nlaid his head on the pillow, and falling into a slumber for a little\r\nwhile, so ended his life in silence.\r\n\r\nThus it came to pass, that as he had served the Lord with a simple and\r\npure mind, and quiet devotion, so he now departed to behold His Presence,\r\nleaving the world by a quiet death; and that tongue, which had uttered so\r\nmany wholesome words in praise of the Creator, spake its last words also\r\nin His praise, while he signed himself with the Cross, and commended his\r\nspirit into His hands; and by what has been here said, he seems to have\r\nhad foreknowledge of his death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXV. Of the vision that appeared to a certain man of God before the\r\nmonastery of the city Coludi was burned down.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time, the monastery of virgins, called the city of Coludi,(714)\r\nabove-mentioned, was burned down, through carelessness; and yet all that\r\nknew it might have been aware that it happened by reason of the wickedness\r\nof those who dwelt in it, and chiefly of those who seemed to be the\r\ngreatest. But there wanted not a warning of the approaching punishment\r\nfrom the Divine mercy whereby they might have been led to amend their\r\nways, and by fasting and tears and prayers, like the Ninevites, have\r\naverted the anger of the just Judge.\r\n\r\nFor there was in that monastery a man of the Scottish race, called\r\nAdamnan,(715) leading a life entirely devoted to God in continence and\r\nprayer, insomuch that he never took any food or drink, except only on\r\nSundays and Thursdays; and often spent whole nights in watching and\r\nprayer. This strictness in austerity of life he had first adopted from the\r\nnecessity of correcting the evil that was in him; but in process of time\r\nthe necessity became a custom.\r\n\r\nFor in his youth he had been guilty of some sin for which, when he came to\r\nhimself, he conceived a great horror, and dreaded lest he should be\r\npunished for the same by the righteous Judge. Betaking himself, therefore,\r\nto a priest, who, he hoped, might show him the way of salvation, he\r\nconfessed his guilt, and desired to be advised how he might escape the\r\nwrath to come. The priest having heard his offence, said, “A great wound\r\nrequires greater care in the healing thereof; wherefore give yourself as\r\nfar as you are able to fasting and psalms, and prayer, to the end that\r\nthus coming before the presence of the Lord in confession,”(716) you may\r\nfind Him merciful. But he, being oppressed with great grief by reason of\r\nhis guilty conscience, and desiring to be the sooner loosed from the\r\ninward fetters of sin, which lay heavy upon him, answered, “I am still\r\nyoung in years and strong of body, and shall, therefore, easily bear all\r\nwhatsoever you shall enjoin me to do, if so be that I may be saved in the\r\nday of the Lord, even though you should bid me spend the whole night\r\nstanding in prayer, and pass the whole week in abstinence.” The priest\r\nreplied, “It is much for you to continue for a whole week without bodily\r\nsustenance; it is enough to observe a fast for two or three days; do this\r\ntill I come again to you in a short time, when I will more fully show you\r\nwhat you ought to do, and how long to persevere in your penance.” Having\r\nso said, and prescribed the measure of his penance, the priest went away,\r\nand upon some sudden occasion passed over into Ireland, which was his\r\nnative country, and returned no more to him, as he had appointed. But the\r\nman remembering this injunction and his own promise, gave himself up\r\nentirely to tears of penitence, holy vigils and continence; so that he\r\nonly took food on Thursdays and Sundays, as has been said; and continued\r\nfasting all the other days of the week. When he heard that his priest had\r\ngone to Ireland, and had died there, he ever after observed this manner of\r\nabstinence, which had been appointed for him as we have said; and as he\r\nhad begun that course through the fear of God, in penitence for his guilt,\r\nso he still continued the same unremittingly for the love of God, and\r\nthrough delight in its rewards.\r\n\r\nHaving practised this carefully for a long time, it happened that he had\r\ngone on a certain day to a distance from the monastery, accompanied by one\r\nthe brothers; and as they were returning from this journey, when they drew\r\nnear to the monastery, and beheld its lofty buildings, the man of God\r\nburst into tears, and his countenance discovered the trouble of his heart.\r\nHis companion, perceiving it, asked what was the reason, to which he\r\nanswered: “The time is at hand when a devouring fire shall reduce to ashes\r\nall the buildings which you here behold, both public and private.” The\r\nother, hearing these words, when they presently came into the monastery,\r\ntold them to Aebba,(717) the mother of the community. She with good cause\r\nbeing much troubled at that prediction, called the man to her, and\r\nstraitly questioned him concerning the matter and how he came to know it.\r\nHe answered, “Being engaged one night lately in watching and singing\r\npsalms, on a sudden I saw one standing by me whose countenance I did not\r\nknow, and I was startled at his presence, but he bade me not to fear, and\r\nspeaking to me like a friend he said, ‘You do well in that you have chosen\r\nrather at this time of rest not to give yourself up to sleep, but to\r\ncontinue in watching and prayer.’ I answered, ‘I know I have great need to\r\ncontinue in wholesome watching and earnest prayer to the Lord to pardon my\r\ntransgressions.’ He replied, ‘You speak truly, for you and many more have\r\nneed to redeem their sins by good works, and when they cease from temporal\r\nlabours, then to labour the more eagerly for desire of eternal blessings;\r\nbut this very few do; for I, having now gone through all this monastery in\r\norder, have looked into the huts(718) and beds of all, and found none of\r\nthem except yourself busy about the health of his soul; but all of them,\r\nboth men and women, are either sunk in slothful sleep, or are awake in\r\norder to commit sin; for even the cells that were built for prayer or\r\nreading, are now converted into places of feasting, drinking, talking, and\r\nother delights; the very virgins dedicated to God, laying aside the\r\nrespect due to their profession, whensoever they are at leisure, apply\r\nthemselves to weaving fine garments, wherewith to adorn themselves like\r\nbrides, to the danger of their state, or to gain the friendship of strange\r\nmen; for which reason, as is meet, a heavy judgement from Heaven with\r\nraging fire is ready to fall on this place and those that dwell\r\ntherein.’ ” The abbess said, “Why did you not sooner reveal to me what you\r\nknew?” He answered, “I was afraid to do it, out of respect to you, lest\r\nyou should be too much afflicted; yet you may have this comfort, that the\r\nblow will not fall in your days.” This vision being made known, the\r\ninhabitants of that place were for a few days in some little fear, and\r\nleaving off their sins, began to do penance; but after the death of the\r\nabbess they returned to their former defilement, nay, they committed worse\r\nsins; and when they said “Peace and safety,” the doom of the aforesaid\r\njudgement came suddenly upon them.\r\n\r\nThat all this fell out after this manner, was told me by my most reverend\r\nfellow-priest, Aedgils, who then lived in that monastery. Afterwards, when\r\nmany of the inhabitants had departed thence, on account of the\r\ndestruction, he lived a long time in our monastery,(719) and died there.\r\nWe have thought fit to insert this in our History, to admonish the reader\r\nof the works of the Lord, how terrible He is in His doing toward the\r\nchildren of men, lest haply we should at some time or other yield to the\r\nsnares of the flesh, and dreading too little the judgement of God, fall\r\nunder His sudden wrath, and either in His righteous anger be brought low\r\nwith temporal losses, or else be more strictly tried and snatched away to\r\neternal perdition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXVI. Of the death of the Kings Egfrid and Hlothere. [684-685 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 684, Egfrid, king of the Northumbrians, sending\r\nhis general, Berct,(720) with an army into Ireland, miserably laid waste\r\nthat unoffending nation, which had always been most friendly to the\r\nEnglish; insomuch that the invading force spared not even the churches or\r\nmonasteries. But the islanders, while to the utmost of their power they\r\nrepelled force with force, implored the assistance of the Divine mercy,\r\nand with constant imprecations invoked the vengeance of Heaven; and though\r\nsuch as curse cannot inherit the kingdom of God, yet it was believed, that\r\nthose who were justly cursed on account of their impiety, soon suffered\r\nthe penalty of their guilt at the avenging hand of God. For the very next\r\nyear, when that same king had rashly led his army to ravage the province\r\nof the Picts,(721) greatly against the advice of his friends, and\r\nparticularly of Cuthbert,(722) of blessed memory, who had been lately\r\nordained bishop, the enemy made a feigned retreat, and the king was drawn\r\ninto a narrow pass among remote mountains,(723) and slain, with the\r\ngreater part of the forces he had led thither, on the 20th of May, in the\r\nfortieth year of his age, and the fifteenth of his reign.(724) His\r\nfriends, as has been said, advised him not to engage in this war; but\r\nsince he had the year before refused to listen to the most reverend\r\nfather, Egbert,(725) advising him not to attack the Scots, who were doing\r\nhim no harm, it was laid upon him as a punishment for his sin, that he\r\nshould now not listen to those who would have prevented his death.\r\n\r\nFrom that time the hopes and strength of the Anglian kingdom “began to ebb\r\nand fall away;”(726) for the Picts recovered their own lands, which had\r\nbeen held by the English, and so did also the Scots that were in Britain;\r\nand some of the Britons(727) regained their liberty, which they have now\r\nenjoyed for about forty-six years. Among the many English that then either\r\nfell by the sword, or were made slaves, or escaped by flight out of the\r\ncountry of the Picts, the most reverend man of God, Trumwine,(728) who had\r\nbeen made bishop over them, withdrew with his people that were in the\r\nmonastery of Aebbercurnig,(729) in the country of the English, but close\r\nby the arm of the sea which is the boundary between the lands of the\r\nEnglish and the Picts. Having commended his followers, wheresoever he\r\ncould, to his friends in the monasteries, he chose his own place of abode\r\nin the monastery, which we have so often mentioned, of servants and\r\nhandmaids of God, at Streanaeshalch;(730) and there for many years, with a\r\nfew of his own brethren, he led a life in all monastic austerity, not only\r\nto his own benefit, but to the benefit of many others, and dying there, he\r\nwas buried in the church of the blessed Peter the Apostle,(731) with the\r\nhonour due to his life and rank. The royal virgin, Elfled,(732) with her\r\nmother, Eanfled, whom we have mentioned before, then presided over that\r\nmonastery; but when the bishop came thither, that devout teacher found in\r\nhim the greatest help in governing, and comfort in her private life.\r\nAldfrid(733) succeeded Egfrid in the throne, being a man most learned in\r\nthe Scriptures, said to be brother to Egfrid, and son to King Oswy; he\r\nnobly retrieved the ruined state of the kingdom, though within narrower\r\nbounds.\r\n\r\nThe same year, being the 685th from the Incarnation of our Lord,\r\nHlothere,(734) king of Kent, died on the 6th of February, when he had\r\nreigned twelve years after his brother Egbert,(735) who had reigned nine\r\nyears: he was wounded in battle with the South Saxons, whom Edric,(736)\r\nthe son of Egbert, had raised against him, and died whilst his wound was\r\nbeing dressed. After him, this same Edric reigned a year and a half. On\r\nhis death, kings of doubtful title, or of foreign origin,(737) for some\r\ntime wasted the kingdom, till the lawful king, Wictred,(738) the son of\r\nEgbert, being settled in the throne, by his piety and zeal delivered his\r\nnation from foreign invasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXVII. How Cuthbert, a man of God, was made bishop; and how he lived\r\nand taught whilst still in the monastic life. [685 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same year in which King Egfrid departed this life,(739) he, as has\r\nbeen said, caused the holy and venerable Cuthbert(740) to be ordained\r\nbishop of the church of Lindisfarne. He had for many years led a solitary\r\nlife, in great continence of body and mind, in a very small island, called\r\nFarne,(741) in the ocean about nine miles distant from that same church.\r\nFrom his earliest childhood(742) he had always been inflamed with the\r\ndesire of a religious life; and he adopted the name and habit of a monk\r\nwhen he was quite a young man: he first entered the monastery of\r\nMailros,(743) which is on the bank of the river Tweed, and was then\r\ngoverned by the Abbot Eata,(744) a man of great gentleness and simplicity,\r\nwho was afterward made bishop of the church of Hagustald or\r\nLindisfarne,(745) as has been said above. The provost of the monastery at\r\nthat time was Boisil,(746) a priest of great virtue and of a prophetic\r\nspirit. Cuthbert, humbly submitting himself to this man’s direction, from\r\nhim received both a knowledge of the Scriptures, and an example of good\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nAfter he had departed to the Lord, Cuthbert became provost of that\r\nmonastery, where he instructed many in the rule of monastic life, both by\r\nthe authority of a master, and the example of his own behaviour. Nor did\r\nhe bestow his teaching and his example in the monastic life on his\r\nmonastery alone, but laboured far and wide to convert the people dwelling\r\nround about from the life of foolish custom, to the love of heavenly joys;\r\nfor many profaned the faith which they held by their wicked actions; and\r\nsome also, in the time of a pestilence, neglecting the mysteries of the\r\nfaith which they had received, had recourse to the false remedies of\r\nidolatry, as if they could have put a stop to the plague sent from God, by\r\nincantations, amulets, or any other secrets of the Devil’s art. In order\r\nto correct the error of both sorts, he often went forth from the\r\nmonastery, sometimes on horseback, but oftener on foot, and went to the\r\nneighbouring townships, where he preached the way of truth to such as had\r\ngone astray; which Boisil also in his time had been wont to do. It was\r\nthen the custom of the English people, that when a clerk or priest came to\r\na township, they all, at his summons, flocked together to hear the Word;\r\nwillingly heard what was said, and still more willingly practised those\r\nthings that they could hear and understand. And such was Cuthbert’s skill\r\nin speaking, so keen his desire to persuade men of what he taught, such a\r\nlight shone in his angelic face, that no man present dared to conceal from\r\nhim the secrets of his heart, but all openly revealed in confession what\r\nthey had done, thinking doubtless that their guilt could in nowise be\r\nhidden from him; and having confessed their sins, they wiped them out by\r\nfruits worthy of repentance, as he bade them. He was wont chiefly to\r\nresort to those places and preach in those villages which were situated\r\nafar off amid steep and wild mountains, so that others dreaded to go\r\nthither, and whereof the poverty and barbarity rendered them inaccessible\r\nto other teachers. But he, devoting himself entirely to that pious labour,\r\nso industriously ministered to them with his wise teaching, that when he\r\nwent forth from the monastery, he would often stay a whole week, sometimes\r\ntwo or three, or even sometimes a full month, before he returned home,\r\ncontinuing among the hill folk to call that simple people by his preaching\r\nand good works to the things of Heaven.\r\n\r\nThis venerable servant of the Lord, having thus spent many years in the\r\nmonastery of Mailros, and there become conspicuous by great tokens of\r\nvirtue, his most reverend abbot, Eata, removed him to the isle of\r\nLindisfarne, that he might there also, by his authority as provost and by\r\nthe example of his own practice, instruct the brethren in the observance\r\nof regular discipline; for the same reverend father then governed that\r\nplace also as abbot. From ancient times, the bishop was wont to reside\r\nthere with his clergy, and the abbot with his monks, who were likewise\r\nunder the paternal care of the bishop; because Aidan, who was the first\r\nbishop of the place, being himself a monk, brought monks thither, and\r\nsettled the monastic institution there;(747) as the blessed Father\r\nAugustine is known to have done before in Kent, when the most reverend\r\nPope Gregory wrote to him, as has been said above, to this effect: “But in\r\nthat you, my brother, having been instructed in monastic rules, must not\r\nlive apart from your clergy in the Church of the English, which has been\r\nlately, by the will of God, converted to the faith, you must establish the\r\nmanner of conversation of our fathers in the primitive Church, among whom,\r\nnone said that aught of the things which they possessed was his own; but\r\nthey had all things common.”(748)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXVIII. How the same St. Cuthbert, living the life of an Anchorite,\r\nby his prayers obtained a spring in a dry soil, and had a crop from seed\r\nsown by the labour of his hands out of season. [676 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this, Cuthbert, as he grew in goodness and intensity of devotion,\r\nattained also to a hermit’s life of contemplation in silence and solitude,\r\nas we have mentioned. But forasmuch as many years ago we wrote enough\r\nconcerning his life and virtues, both in heroic verse and prose,(749) it\r\nmay suffice at present only to mention this, that when he was about to go\r\nto the island, he declared to the brothers, “If by the grace of God it\r\nshall be granted to me, that I may live in that place by the labour of my\r\nhands, I will willingly abide there; but if not, God willing, I will very\r\nsoon return to you.” The place was quite destitute of water, corn, and\r\ntrees; and being infested by evil spirits, was very ill suited for human\r\nhabitation; but it became in all respects habitable, at the desire of the\r\nman of God; for at his coming the wicked spirits departed. When, after\r\nexpelling the enemy, he had, with the help of the brethren, built himself\r\na narrow dwelling, with a mound about it, and the necessary cells in it,\r\nto wit, an oratory and a common living room, he ordered the brothers to\r\ndig a pit in the floor of the room, although the ground was hard and\r\nstony, and no hopes appeared of any spring. When they had done this\r\nrelying upon the faith and prayers of the servant of God, the next day it\r\nwas found to be full of water, and to this day affords abundance of its\r\nheavenly bounty to all that resort thither. He also desired that\r\ninstruments for husbandry might be brought him, and some wheat; but having\r\nprepared the ground and sown the wheat at the proper season, no sign of a\r\nblade, not to speak of ears, had sprouted from it by the summer. Hereupon,\r\nwhen the brethren visited him according to custom, he ordered barley to be\r\nbrought him, if haply it were either the nature of the soil, or the will\r\nof God, the Giver of all things, that such grain rather should grow there.\r\nHe sowed it in the same field, when it was brought him, after the proper\r\ntime of sowing, and therefore without any likelihood of its bearing fruit;\r\nbut a plentiful crop immediately sprang up, and afforded the man of God\r\nthe means which he had desired of supporting himself by his own labour.\r\n\r\nWhen he had here served God in solitude many years, the mound which\r\nencompassed his dwelling being so high, that he could see nothing from it\r\nbut heaven, which he thirsted to enter, it happened that a great synod was\r\nassembled in the presence of King Egfrid, near the river Alne, at a place\r\ncalled Adtuifyrdi,(750) which signifies “at the two fords,” in which\r\nArchbishop Theodore, of blessed memory, presided, and there Cuthbert was,\r\nwith one mind and consent of all, chosen bishop of the church of\r\nLindisfarne. They could not, however, draw him from his hermitage, though\r\nmany messengers and letters were sent to him. At last the aforesaid king\r\nhimself, with the most holy Bishop Trumwine,(751) and other religious and\r\npowerful men, sailed to the island; many also of the brothers from the\r\nisle of Lindisfarne itself, assembled together for the same purpose: they\r\nall knelt, and conjured him by the Lord, with tears and entreaties, till\r\nthey drew him, also in tears, from his beloved retreat, and forced him to\r\ngo to the synod. When he arrived there, he was very reluctantly overcome\r\nby the unanimous resolution of all present, and compelled to take upon\r\nhimself the duties of the episcopate; being chiefly prevailed upon by the\r\nwords of Boisil, the servant of God, who, when he had prophetically(752)\r\nforetold all things that were to befall him, had also predicted that he\r\nshould be a bishop. Nevertheless, the consecration was not appointed\r\nimmediately; but when the winter, which was then at hand, was over, it was\r\ncarried out at Easter,(753) in the city of York, and in the presence of\r\nthe aforesaid King Egfrid; seven bishops coming together for his\r\nconsecration, among whom, Theodore, of blessed memory, was Primate. He was\r\nfirst elected bishop of the church of Hagustald, in the place of\r\nTunbert,(754) who had been deposed from the episcopate; but because he\r\nchose rather to be placed over the church of Lindisfarne, in which he had\r\nlived, it was thought fit that Eata should return to the see of the church\r\nof Hagustald, to which he had been first ordained, and that Cuthbert\r\nshould take upon him the government of the church of Lindisfarne.(755)\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of the blessed Apostles, he adorned the episcopal\r\ndignity by his virtuous deeds; for he both protected the people committed\r\nto his charge by constant prayer, and roused them, by wholesome\r\nadmonitions, to thoughts of Heaven. He first showed in his own life what\r\nhe taught others to do, a practice which greatly strengthens all teaching;\r\nfor he was above all things inflamed with the fire of Divine charity, of\r\nsober mind and patient, most diligently intent on devout prayers, and\r\nkindly to all that came to him for comfort. He thought it stood in the\r\nstead of prayer to afford the weak brethren the help of his exhortation,\r\nknowing that he who said “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,” said\r\nlikewise, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour.” He was noted for penitential\r\nabstinence, and was always through the grace of compunction, intent upon\r\nheavenly things. And when he offered up to God the Sacrifice of the saving\r\nVictim, he commended his prayer to the Lord, not with uplifted voice, but\r\nwith tears drawn from the bottom of his heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXIX. How this bishop foretold that his own death was at hand to the\r\nanchorite Herebert. [687 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving spent two years in his bishopric, he returned to his island and\r\nhermitage,(756) being warned of God that the day of his death, or rather\r\nof his entrance into that life which alone can be called life, was drawing\r\nnear; as he, at that time, with his wonted candour, signified to certain\r\npersons, though in words which were somewhat obscure, but which were\r\nnevertheless afterwards plainly understood; while to others he declared\r\nthe same openly.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain priest, called Herebert, a man of holy life, who had\r\nlong been united with the man of God, Cuthbert, in the bonds of spiritual\r\nfriendship. This man leading a solitary life in the island of that great\r\nlake from which the river Derwent flows at its beginning,(757) was wont to\r\nvisit him every year, and to receive from him the teaching of everlasting\r\nsalvation. Hearing that Bishop Cuthbert was come to the city of\r\nLugubalia,(758) he went thither to him, according to his custom, seeking\r\nto be more and more inflamed in heavenly desires through his wholesome\r\nadmonitions. Whilst they alternately entertained one another with draughts\r\nof the celestial life, the bishop, among other things, said, “Brother\r\nHerebert, remember at this time to ask me and speak to me concerning all\r\nwhereof you have need to ask and speak; for, when we part, we shall never\r\nagain see one another with bodily eyesight in this world. For I know of a\r\nsurety that the time of my departure is at hand, and that shortly I must\r\nput off this my tabernacle.” Hearing these words, Herebert fell down at\r\nhis feet, with tears and lamentations, and said, “I beseech you, by the\r\nLord, not to forsake me; but to remember your most faithful companion, and\r\nentreat the mercy of God that, as we have served Him together upon earth,\r\nso we may depart together to behold His grace in Heaven. For you know that\r\nI have always endeavoured to live according to the words of your lips, and\r\nlikewise whatsoever faults I have committed, either through ignorance or\r\nfrailty, I have instantly sought to amend according to the judgement of\r\nyour will.” The bishop applied himself to prayer, and having presently had\r\nintimation in the spirit that he had obtained what he asked of the Lord,\r\nhe said, “Rise, brother, and do not weep, but rejoice greatly because the\r\nmercy of Heaven has granted what we desired.”\r\n\r\nThe event established the truth of this promise and prophecy, for after\r\ntheir parting, they never again saw one another in the flesh; but their\r\nspirits quitting their bodies on one and the same day, to wit, the 20th of\r\nMarch,(759) were immediately united in fellowship in the blessed vision,\r\nand together translated to the heavenly kingdom by the ministry of angels.\r\nBut Herebert was first wasted by a long-continued infirmity, through the\r\ndispensation of the Lord’s mercy, as may be believed, to the end that if\r\nhe was in any wise inferior in merit to the blessed Cuthbert, that which\r\nwas lacking might be supplied by the chastening pain of a long sickness,\r\nthat being thus made equal in grace to his intercessor, as he departed out\r\nof the body at one and the same time with him, so he might be accounted\r\nworthy to be received into the like abode of eternal bliss.\r\n\r\nThe most reverend father died in the isle of Farne, earnestly entreating\r\nthe brothers that he might also be buried there, where he had served no\r\nsmall time under the Lord’s banner. But at length yielding to their\r\nentreaties, he consented to be carried back to the isle of Lindisfarne,\r\nand there buried in the church.(760) This being done, the venerable Bishop\r\nWilfrid held the episcopal see of that church one year,(761) till such\r\ntime as a bishop should be chosen to be ordained in the room of Cuthbert.\r\nAfterwards Eadbert(762) was ordained, a man renowned for his knowledge of\r\nthe Holy Scriptures, as also for his observance of the heavenly precepts,\r\nand chiefly for almsgiving, so that, according to the law, he gave every\r\nyear the tenth part, not only of four-footed beasts, but also of all corn\r\nand fruit, as also of his garments, to the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXX. How his body was found altogether uncorrupted after it had been\r\nburied eleven years; and how his successor in the bishopric departed this\r\nworld not long after. [698 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to show forth the great glory of the life after death of the man\r\nof God, Cuthbert, whereas the loftiness of his life before his death had\r\nbeen revealed by the testimony of many miracles, when he had been buried\r\neleven years, Divine Providence put it into the minds of the brethren to\r\ntake up his bones. They thought to find them dry and all the rest of the\r\nbody consumed and turned to dust, after the manner of the dead, and they\r\ndesired to put them into a new coffin, and to lay them in the same place,\r\nbut above the pavement, for the honour due to him. They made known their\r\nresolve to Bishop Eadbert, and he consented to it, and bade them to be\r\nmindful to do it on the anniversary of his burial. They did so, and\r\nopening the grave, found all the body whole, as if he were still alive,\r\nand the joints of the limbs pliable, like one asleep rather than dead;\r\nbesides, all the vestments in which he was clothed were not only\r\nundefiled, but marvellous to behold, being fresh and bright as at the\r\nfirst. The brothers seeing this, were struck with a great dread, and\r\nhastened to tell the bishop what they had found; he being then alone in a\r\nplace remote from the church, and encompassed on all sides by the shifting\r\nwaves of the sea. There he always used to spend the time of Lent, and was\r\nwont to pass the forty days before the Nativity of our Lord, in great\r\ndevotion with abstinence and prayer and tears. There also his venerable\r\npredecessor, Cuthbert, had for some time served as the soldier of the Lord\r\nin solitude before he went to the isle of Farne.\r\n\r\nThey brought him also some part of the garments that had covered the holy\r\nbody; which presents he thankfully accepted, and gladly heard of the\r\nmiracles, and he kissed the garments even, with great affection, as if\r\nthey had been still upon his father’s body, and said, “Let new garments be\r\nput upon the body, in place of these you have brought, and so lay it in\r\nthe coffin which you have prepared; for I know of a surety that the place\r\nwill not long remain empty, which has been hallowed with so great grace of\r\nheavenly miracles; and how happy is he to whom the Lord, the Author and\r\nGiver of all bliss, shall vouchsafe to grant the privilege of resting\r\ntherein.” When the bishop had made an end of saying this and more in like\r\nmanner, with many tears and great compunction and with faltering tongue,\r\nthe brothers did as he had commanded them, and when they had wrapped the\r\nbody in new garments, and laid it in a new coffin, they placed it above\r\nthe pavement of the sanctuary. Soon after, Bishop Eadbert, beloved of God,\r\nfell grievously sick, and his fever daily increasing in severity, ere\r\nlong, that is, on the 6th of May,(763) he also departed to the Lord, and\r\nthey laid his body in the grave of the blessed father Cuthbert, placing\r\nover it the coffin, with the uncorrupted remains of that father. The\r\nmiracles of healing, sometimes wrought in that place testify to the merits\r\nof them both; of some of these we have before preserved the memory in the\r\nbook of his life. But in this History we have thought fit to add some\r\nothers which have lately come to our knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXXI. Of one that was cured of a palsy at his tomb.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was in that same monastery a brother whose name was Badudegn, who\r\nhad for no small time ministered to the guests of the house, and is still\r\nliving, having the testimony of all the brothers and strangers resorting\r\nthither, of being a man of much piety and religion, and serving the office\r\nput upon him only for the sake of the heavenly reward. This man, having\r\none day washed in the sea the coverings or blankets which he used in the\r\nguest chamber, was returning home, when on the way, he was seized with a\r\nsudden infirmity, insomuch that he fell to the ground, and lay there a\r\nlong time and could scarce at last rise again. When he got up, he felt one\r\nhalf of his body, from the head to the foot, struck with palsy, and with\r\ngreat trouble made his way home by the help of a staff. The disease\r\nincreased by degrees, and as night approached, became still worse, so that\r\nwhen day returned, he could scarcely rise or walk alone. Suffering from\r\nthis trouble, he conceived the wise resolve to go to the church, as best\r\nhe could, and approach the tomb of the reverend father Cuthbert, and\r\nthere, on his knees, humbly beseech the mercy of God that he might either\r\nbe delivered from that disease, if it were well for him, or if by the\r\ngrace of God it was ordained for him to be chastened longer by this\r\naffliction, that he might bear the pain which was laid upon him with\r\npatience and a quiet mind.\r\n\r\nHe did accordingly as he had determined, and supporting his weak limbs\r\nwith a staff, entered the church. There prostrating himself before the\r\nbody of the man of God, he prayed with pious earnestness, that, through\r\nhis intercession, the Lord might be propitious to him. As he prayed, he\r\nseemed to fall into a deep sleep, and, as he was afterwards wont to\r\nrelate, felt a large and broad hand touch his head, where the pain lay,\r\nand likewise pass over all that part of his body which had been benumbed\r\nby the disease, down to his feet. Gradually the pain departed and health\r\nreturned. Then he awoke, and rose up in perfect health, and returning\r\nthanks to the Lord for his recovery, told the brothers what had been done\r\nfor him; and to the joy of them all, returned the more zealously, as if\r\nchastened by the trial of his affliction, to the service which he was wont\r\nbefore to perform with care.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the very garments which had been on Cuthbert’s body, dedicated\r\nto God, either while he was alive, or after his death, were not without\r\nthe virtue of healing, as may be seen in the book of his life and\r\nmiracles, by such as shall read it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXXII. Of one who was lately cured of a disease in his eye at the\r\nrelics of St. Cuthbert.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor is that cure to be passed over in silence, which was performed by his\r\nrelics three years ago, and was told me lately by the brother himself, on\r\nwhom it was wrought. It happened in the monastery, which, being built near\r\nthe river Dacore,(764) has taken its name from the same, over which, at\r\nthat time, the religious Suidbert(765) presided as abbot. In that\r\nmonastery was a youth whose eyelid was disfigured by an unsightly tumour,\r\nwhich growing daily greater, threatened the loss of the eye. The\r\nphysicians endeavoured to mitigate it by applying ointments, but in vain.\r\nSome said it ought to be cut off; others opposed this course, for fear of\r\ngreater danger. The brother having long laboured under this malady, when\r\nno human means availed to save his eye, but rather, it grew daily worse,\r\non a sudden, through the grace of the mercy of God, it came to pass that\r\nhe was cured by the relics of the holy father, Cuthbert. For when the\r\nbrethren found his body uncorrupted, after having been many years buried,\r\nthey took some part of the hair, to give, as relics, to friends who asked\r\nfor them, or to show, in testimony of the miracle.\r\n\r\nOne of the priests of the monastery, named Thruidred, who is now abbot\r\nthere, had a small part of these relics by him at that time. One day he\r\nwent into the church and opened the box of relics, to give some part of\r\nthem to a friend who asked for it, and it happened that the youth who had\r\nthe diseased eye was then in the church. The priest, having given his\r\nfriend as much as he thought fit, gave the rest to the youth to put back\r\ninto its place. But he having received the hairs of the holy head,\r\nprompted by some salutary impulse, applied them to the diseased eyelid,\r\nand endeavoured for some time, by the application of them, to abate and\r\nmitigate the tumour. Having done this, he again laid the relics in the\r\nbox, as he had been bidden, believing that his eye would soon be cured by\r\nthe hairs of the man of God, which had touched it; nor did his faith\r\ndisappoint him. It was then, as he is wont to relate, about the second\r\nhour of the day; but while he was occupied with other thoughts and\r\nbusiness of the day, on a sudden, about the sixth hour of the same,\r\ntouching his eye, he found it and the eyelid as sound as if there never\r\nhad been any disfigurement or tumour on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. I. How Ethelwald, successor to Cuthbert, leading a hermit’s life,\r\ncalmed a tempest by his prayers when the brethren were in danger at sea.\r\n[687-699 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe venerable Ethelwald(766) succeeded the man of God, Cuthbert, in the\r\nexercise of a solitary life, which he spent in the isle of Farne(767)\r\nbefore he became a bishop. After he had received the priesthood, he\r\nconsecrated his office by deeds worthy of that degree for many years in\r\nthe monastery which is called Inhrypum.(768) To the end that his merit and\r\nmanner of life may be the more certainly made known, I will relate one\r\nmiracle of his, which was told me by one of the brothers for and on whom\r\nthe same was wrought; to wit, Guthfrid, the venerable servant and priest\r\nof Christ, who also, afterwards, as abbot, presided over the brethren of\r\nthe same church of Lindisfarne, in which he was educated.\r\n\r\n“I came,” says he, “to the island of Farne, with two others of the\r\nbrethren, desiring to speak with the most reverend father, Ethelwald.\r\nHaving been refreshed with his discourse, and asked for his blessing, as\r\nwe were returning home, behold on a sudden, when we were in the midst of\r\nthe sea, the fair weather in which we were sailing, was broken, and there\r\narose so great and terrible a tempest, that neither sails nor oars were of\r\nany use to us, nor had we anything to expect but death. After long\r\nstruggling with the wind and waves to no effect, at last we looked back to\r\nsee whether it was possible by any means at least to return to the island\r\nwhence we came, but we found that we were on all sides alike cut off by\r\nthe storm, and that there was no hope of escape by our own efforts. But\r\nlooking further, we perceived, on the island of Farne, our father\r\nEthelwald, beloved of God, come out of his retreat to watch our course;\r\nfor, hearing the noise of the tempest and raging sea, he had come forth to\r\nsee what would become of us. When he beheld us in distress and despair, he\r\nbowed his knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, in prayer for our\r\nlife and safety; and as he finished his prayer, he calmed the swelling\r\nwater, in such sort that the fierceness of the storm ceased on all sides,\r\nand fair winds attended us over a smooth sea to the very shore. When we\r\nhad landed, and had pulled up our small vessel from the waves, the storm,\r\nwhich had ceased a short time for our sake, presently returned, and raged\r\nfuriously during the whole day; so that it plainly appeared that the brief\r\ninterval of calm had been granted by Heaven in answer to the prayers of\r\nthe man of God, to the end that we might escape.”\r\n\r\nThe man of God remained in the isle of Farne twelve years, and died there;\r\nbut was buried in the church of the blessed Apostle Peter, in the isle of\r\nLindisfarne, beside the bodies of the aforesaid bishops.(769) These things\r\nhappened in the days of King Aldfrid,(770) who, after his brother Egfrid,\r\nruled the nation of the Northumbrians for nineteen years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. II. How Bishop John cured a dumb man by his blessing. [687 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of Aldfrid’s reign, Bishop Eata(771) died, and was\r\nsucceeded in the bishopric of the church of Hagustald by the holy man\r\nJohn,(772) of whom those that knew him well are wont to tell many\r\nmiracles, and more particularly Berthun,(773) a man worthy of all\r\nreverence and of undoubted truthfulness, and once his deacon, now abbot of\r\nthe monastery called Inderauuda,(774) that is, “In the wood of the Deiri”:\r\nsome of which miracles we have thought fit to hand on to posterity. There\r\nis a certain remote dwelling(775) enclosed by a mound, among scattered\r\ntrees, not far from the church of Hagustald, being about a mile and a half\r\ndistant and separated from it by the river Tyne, having an oratory(776)\r\ndedicated to St. Michael the Archangel, where the man of God used\r\nfrequently, as occasion offered, and specially in Lent, to abide with a\r\nfew companions and in quiet give himself to prayer and study. Having come\r\nhither once at the beginning of Lent to stay, he bade his followers find\r\nout some poor man labouring under any grievous infirmity, or want, whom\r\nthey might keep with them during those days, to receive alms, for so he\r\nwas always used to do.\r\n\r\nThere was in a township not far off, a certain youth who was dumb, known\r\nto the bishop, for he often used to come into his presence to receive\r\nalms. He had never been able to speak one word; besides, he had so much\r\nscurf and scab on his head, that no hair could ever grow on the top of it,\r\nbut only some rough hairs stood on end round about it. The bishop caused\r\nthis young man to be brought, and a little hut to be made for him within\r\nthe enclosure of the dwelling, in which he might abide, and receive alms\r\nfrom him every day. When one week of Lent was over, the next Sunday he\r\nbade the poor man come to him, and when he had come, he bade him put his\r\ntongue out of his mouth and show it him; then taking him by the chin, he\r\nmade the sign of the Holy Cross on his tongue, directing him to draw it\r\nback so signed into his mouth and to speak. “Pronounce some word,” said\r\nhe; “say ‘gae,’ ” which, in the language of the English, is the word of\r\naffirming and consenting, that is, yes. The youth’s tongue was immediately\r\nloosed, and he spoke as he was bidden. The bishop then added the names of\r\nthe letters: “Say A.” He said A. “Say B;” he said B also. When he had\r\nrepeated all the letters after the bishop, the latter proceeded to put\r\nsyllables and words to him, and when he had repeated them all rightly he\r\nbade him utter whole sentences, and he did it. Nor did he cease all that\r\nday and the next night, as long as he could keep awake, as those who were\r\npresent relate, to say something, and to express his private thoughts and\r\nwishes to others, which he could never do before; after the manner of the\r\nman long lame, who, when he was healed by the Apostles Peter and\r\nJohn,(777) leaping up, stood and walked, and entered with them into the\r\ntemple, walking, and leaping, and praising the Lord, rejoicing to have the\r\nuse of his feet, which he had so long lacked. The bishop, rejoicing with\r\nhim at his cure, caused the physician to take in hand the healing of the\r\nsores of his head. He did as he was bidden, and with the help of the\r\nbishop’s blessing and prayers, a goodly head of hair grew as the skin was\r\nhealed. Thus the youth became fair of countenance, ready of speech, with\r\nhair curling in comely fashion, whereas before he had been ill-favoured,\r\nmiserable, and dumb. Thus filled with joy at his recovered health,\r\nnotwithstanding that the bishop offered to keep him in his own household,\r\nhe chose rather to return home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. III. How he healed a sick maiden by his prayers. [705 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same Berthun told another miracle concerning the said bishop. When the\r\nmost reverend Wilfrid, after a long banishment, was admitted to the\r\nbishopric of the church of Hagustald,(778) and the aforesaid John, upon\r\nthe death of Bosa,(779) a man of great sanctity and humility, was, in his\r\nplace, appointed bishop of York, he himself came, once upon a time, to the\r\nmonastery of nuns, at the place called Wetadun,(780) where the Abbess\r\nHeriburg then presided. “When we were come thither,” said he, “and had\r\nbeen received with great and universal joy, the abbess told us, that one\r\nof the nuns, who was her own daughter after the flesh, laboured under a\r\ngrievous sickness, for she had been lately let blood in the arm, and\r\nwhilst she was under treatment,(781) was seized with an attack of sudden\r\npain, which speedily increased, while the wounded arm became worse, and so\r\nmuch swollen, that it could scarce be compassed with both hands; and she\r\nlay in bed like to die through excess of pain. Wherefore the abbess\r\nentreated the bishop that he would vouchsafe to go in and give her his\r\nblessing; for she believed that she would soon be better if he blessed her\r\nor laid his hands upon her. He asked when the maiden had been let blood,\r\nand being told that it was on the fourth day of the moon, said, ‘You did\r\nvery indiscreetly and unskilfully to let blood on the fourth day of the\r\nmoon; for I remember that Archbishop Theodore,(782) of blessed memory,\r\nsaid, that blood-letting at that time was very dangerous, when the light\r\nof the moon is waxing and the tide of the ocean is rising. And what can I\r\ndo for the maiden if she is like to die?’\r\n\r\n“But the abbess still earnestly entreated for her daughter, whom she\r\ndearly loved, and designed to make abbess in her stead,(783) and at last\r\nprevailed with him to go in and visit the sick maiden. Wherefore he went\r\nin, taking me with him to the maid, who lay, as I said, in sore anguish,\r\nand her arm swelling so greatly that it could not be bent at all at the\r\nelbow; and he stood and said a prayer over her, and having given his\r\nblessing, went out. Afterwards, as we were sitting at table, at the usual\r\nhour, some one came in and called me out, saying, ‘Quoenburg’ (that was\r\nthe maid’s name) ‘desires that you should immediately go back to her.’\r\nThis I did, and entering the chamber, I found her of more cheerful\r\ncountenance, and like one in good health. And while I was sitting beside\r\nher, she said, ‘Shall we call for something to drink?’—‘Yes,’ said I, ‘and\r\nright glad am I, if you can.’ When the cup was brought, and we had both\r\ndrunk, she said, ‘As soon as the bishop had said the prayer for me and\r\ngiven me his blessing and had gone out, I immediately began to mend; and\r\nthough I have not yet recovered my former strength, yet all the pain is\r\nquite gone both from my arm, where it was most burning, and from all my\r\nbody, as if the bishop had carried it away with him; notwithstanding the\r\nswelling of the arm still seems to remain.’ But when we departed thence,\r\nthe cure of the pain in her limbs was followed by the assuaging of the\r\ngrievous swelling; and the maiden being thus delivered from pains and\r\ndeath, returned praise to our Lord and Saviour, in company with His other\r\nservants who were there.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. IV. How he healed a thegn’s wife that was sick, with holy water.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same abbot related another miracle, not unlike the former, of the\r\naforesaid bishop. “Not very far from our monastery,” he said, “to wit,\r\nabout two miles off, was the township(784) of one Puch, a thegn, whose\r\nwife had lain sick of a very grievous disease for nearly forty days,\r\ninsomuch that for three weeks she could not be carried out of the chamber\r\nwhere she lay. It happened that the man of God was, at that time, called\r\nthither by the thegn to consecrate a church; and when that was done, the\r\nthegn desired him to come into his house and dine. The bishop declined,\r\nsaying that he must return to the monastery, which was very near. The\r\nthegn, entreating him more earnestly, vowed he would also give alms to the\r\npoor, if so be that the bishop would vouchsafe to enter his house that day\r\nand break his fast. I joined my entreaties to his, promising in like\r\nmanner to give alms for the relief of the poor,(785) if he would but go\r\nand dine at the thegn’s house, and give his blessing. Having at length,\r\nwith much difficulty, prevailed, we went in to refresh ourselves. The\r\nbishop had sent to the woman that lay sick some of the holy water, which\r\nhe had blessed for the consecration of the church, by one of the brothers\r\nwho had come with me, ordering him to give her some to drink, and wash\r\nthat part of her where he found that her pain was greatest, with some of\r\nthe same water. This being done, the woman immediately got up whole and\r\nsound, and perceiving that she had not only been delivered from her long\r\nsickness, but at the same time had recovered the strength which she had\r\nlost for so great a time, she presented the cup to the bishop and to us,\r\nand continued serving us with meat and drink as she had begun, till dinner\r\nwas over; following the example of the blessed Peter’s wife’s mother, who,\r\nhaving been sick of a fever, arose at the touch of our Lord’s hand, and\r\nhaving forthwith received health and strength, ministered to them.”(786)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. V. How he likewise recalled by his prayers a thegn’s servant from\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt another time also, being called to consecrate the church(787) of a\r\nthegn named Addi, when he had performed the required duty, he was\r\nentreated by the thegn to go in to one of his servants, who lay\r\ndangerously ill, insomuch that having lost all use of his limbs, he seemed\r\nto be at the point of death; and moreover the coffin had been made ready\r\nwherein to bury him after his death. The thegn urged his entreaties with\r\ntears, earnestly beseeching him that he would go in and pray for the\r\nservant, because his life was of great moment to him; and he believed that\r\nif the bishop would lay his hand upon him and give him his blessing, he\r\nwould soon mend. So the bishop went in, and saw him very near death, and\r\nby his side the coffin in which he was to be laid for his burial, whilst\r\nall mourned. He said a prayer and blessed him, and going out, spake the\r\nwonted words of comfort, “Good health be yours and that speedily.”\r\nAfterwards, when they were sitting at table, the servant sent to his lord,\r\ndesiring that he would let him have a cup of wine, because he was thirsty.\r\nThe thegn, rejoicing greatly that he could drink, sent him a cup of wine,\r\nblessed by the bishop; and, as soon as he had drunk it, he immediately got\r\nup, and, shaking off the heaviness of his infirmity, dressed himself and\r\nwent forth, and going in to the bishop, saluted him and the other guests,\r\nsaying that he also would gladly eat and drink with them. They bade him\r\nsit down with them at table, greatly rejoicing at his recovery. He sat\r\ndown, ate and drank and made merry, and behaved himself like the rest of\r\nthe company; and living many years after, continued in the same health\r\nwhich he had gained. The aforesaid abbot says this miracle was not wrought\r\nin his presence, but that he had it from those who were present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. VI. How, both by his prayers and blessing, he recalled from death\r\none of his clerks, who had bruised himself by a fall.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor do I think that this miracle, which Herebald,(788) the servant of\r\nChrist, says was wrought upon himself by the bishop, is to be passed over\r\nin silence. He was then one of that bishop’s clergy, but now presides as\r\nabbot in the monastery at the mouth of the river Tyne.(789) “Living with\r\nhim,” said he, “and being very well acquainted with his course of life, I\r\nfound it to be in all points worthy of a bishop, as far as it is lawful\r\nfor men to judge; but I have known by the experience of others, and more\r\nparticularly by my own, how great his merit was before Him Who seeth the\r\nheart; having been by his prayer and blessing recalled from the threshold\r\nof death and brought back to the way of life. For, when in the prime of my\r\nyouth, I lived among his clergy, applying myself to reading and singing,\r\nbut not having yet altogether withdrawn my heart from youthful pleasures,\r\nit happened one day that, as we were travelling with him, we came into a\r\nplain and open road, well fitted for galloping. The young men that were\r\nwith him, and especially the laymen, began to entreat the bishop to give\r\nthem leave to gallop, and make trial of their horses one with another. He\r\nat first refused, saying that it was an idle request; but at last,\r\novercome by the unanimous desire of so many, ‘Do so,’ said he, ‘if you\r\nwill, but let Herebald have no part in the trial.’ Then I earnestly prayed\r\nthat I might have leave to compete with the rest, for I relied on an\r\nexcellent horse, which he had himself given me, but I could in no wise\r\nobtain my request.\r\n\r\n“When they had several times galloped backwards and forwards, the bishop\r\nand I looking on, my wanton humour prevailed, and I could no longer\r\nrefrain, but though he forbade me, I struck in among them at their sport,\r\nand began to ride with them at full speed; whereat I heard him call after\r\nme with a groan, ‘Alas! how much you grieve me by riding after that\r\nmanner.’ Though I heard him, I went on against his command; but\r\nimmediately the fiery horse taking a great leap over a hollow place in the\r\nway, I fell, and at once lost all sense and motion, like one dying; for\r\nthere was in that place a stone, level with the ground, covered with only\r\na thin coating of turf, and no other stone was to be found in all that\r\nexpanse of plain; and it happened by chance, or rather by Divine\r\nProvidence so ordering it, to punish my disobedience, that my head and my\r\nhand, which in falling I had put under my head, struck upon that stone, so\r\nthat my thumb was broken and my skull fractured, and I became, as I said,\r\nlike one dead.\r\n\r\n“And because I could not move, they stretched a tent there for me to lie\r\nin. It was about the seventh hour of the day, and having lain still and as\r\nit were dead from that time till the evening, I then revived a little, and\r\nwas carried home by my companions, and lay speechless all the night,\r\nvomiting blood, because something was broken within me by the fall. The\r\nbishop was very much grieved at my fall and my misfortune, for he bore me\r\nextraordinary affection. Nor would he stay that night, as he was wont,\r\namong his clergy; but spent it alone in watching and prayer, imploring the\r\nDivine goodness, as I suppose, for my preservation. Coming to me early in\r\nthe morning, and having said a prayer over me, he called me by my name,\r\nand when I awoke as it were out of a heavy sleep, he asked whether I knew\r\nwho it was that spoke to me? I opened my eyes and said, ‘Yes; you are my\r\nbeloved bishop.’—‘Can you live?’ said he. I answered, ‘I can, through your\r\nprayers, if the Lord will.’\r\n\r\n“He then laid his hand on my head, with the words of blessing, and\r\nreturned to prayer; when he came again to see me, in a short time, he\r\nfound me sitting and able to talk; and, being moved by Divine inspiration,\r\nas it soon appeared, began to ask me, whether I knew for certain that I\r\nhad been baptized? I answered that I knew beyond all doubt that I had been\r\nwashed in the font of salvation, for the remission of sins, and I named\r\nthe priest by whom I knew that I had been baptized. He replied, ‘If you\r\nwere baptized by that priest, your baptism is not perfect; for I know him,\r\nand that when he was ordained priest, he could in no wise, by reason of\r\nthe dulness of his understanding, learn the ministry of catechizing and\r\nbaptizing; for which reason I enjoined upon him altogether to desist from\r\npresuming to exercise that ministry, which he could not duly perform.’\r\nThis said, he set himself to catechize me that same hour; and it came to\r\npass that when he breathed on my face,(790) straightway I felt better. He\r\ncalled the surgeon and ordered him to set and bind up my skull where it\r\nwas fractured; and presently having received his blessing, I was so much\r\nbetter that I mounted on horseback the next day, and travelled with him to\r\nanother place; and being soon after perfectly recovered, I was washed in\r\nthe water of life.”\r\n\r\nHe continued in his bishopric thirty-three years,(791) and then ascending\r\nto the heavenly kingdom, was buried in St. Peter’s Chapel, in his own\r\nmonastery, which is called, “In the wood of the Deiri,”(792) in the year\r\nof our Lord 721. For having, by his great age, become unable to govern his\r\nbishopric, he ordained Wilfrid,(793) his priest, bishop of the church of\r\nYork, and retired to the aforesaid monastery, and there ended his days in\r\ngodly conversation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. VII. How Caedwalla, king of the West Saxons, went to Rome to be\r\nbaptized; and his successor Ini, also devoutly journeyed to the same\r\nthreshold of the holy Apostles. [688 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the third year of the reign of Aldfrid,(794) Caedwalla, king of the\r\nWest Saxons, having most vigorously governed his nation for two years,\r\nquitted his crown for the sake of the Lord and an everlasting kingdom, and\r\nwent to Rome, being desirous to obtain the peculiar honour of being\r\ncleansed in the baptismal font at the threshold of the blessed Apostles,\r\nfor he had learned that in Baptism alone the entrance into the heavenly\r\nlife is opened to mankind; and he hoped at the same time, that being made\r\nclean by Baptism, he should soon be freed from the bonds of the flesh and\r\npass to the eternal joys of Heaven; both which things, by the help of the\r\nLord, came to pass according as he had conceived in his mind. For coming\r\nto Rome, at the time that Sergius(795) was pope, he was baptized on the\r\nHoly Saturday before Easter Day,(796) in the year of our Lord 689, and\r\nbeing still in his white garments,(797) he fell sick, and was set free\r\nfrom the bonds of the flesh on the 20th of April, and obtained an entrance\r\ninto the kingdom of the blessed in Heaven. At his baptism, the aforesaid\r\npope had given him the name of Peter, to the end, that he might be also\r\nunited in name to the most blessed chief of the Apostles, to whose most\r\nholy body his pious love had led him from the utmost bounds of the earth.\r\nHe was likewise buried in his church, and by the pope’s command an\r\nepitaph(798) was written on his tomb, wherein the memory of his devotion\r\nmight be preserved for ever, and the readers or hearers thereof might be\r\nstirred up to give themselves to religion by the example of what he had\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nThe epitaph was this:—\r\n\r\n“High estate, wealth, offspring, a mighty kingdom, triumphs, spoils,\r\nchieftains, strongholds, the camp, a home; whatsoever the valour of his\r\nsires, whatsoever himself had won, Caedwal, mighty in war, left for the\r\nlove of God, that, a pilgrim king, he might behold Peter and Peter’s seat,\r\nreceive at his font pure waters of life, and in bright draughts drink of\r\nthe shining radiance whence a quickening glory streams through all the\r\nworld. And even as he gained with eager soul the prize of the new life, he\r\nlaid aside barbaric rage, and, changed in heart, he changed his name with\r\njoy. Sergius the Pope bade him be called Peter, himself his father,(799)\r\nwhen he rose born anew from the font, and the grace of Christ, cleansing\r\nhim, bore him forthwith clothed in white raiment to the heights of Heaven.\r\nO wondrous faith of the king, but greatest of all the mercy of Christ,\r\ninto whose counsels none may enter! For he came in safety from the ends of\r\nthe earth, even from Britain, through many a nation, over many a sea, by\r\nmany a path, and saw the city of Romulus and looked upon Peter’s sanctuary\r\nrevered, bearing mystic gifts. He shall walk in white among the sheep of\r\nChrist in fellowship with them; for his body is in the tomb, but his soul\r\non high. Thou mightest deem he did but change an earthly for a heavenly\r\nsceptre, whom thou seest attain to the kingdom of Christ.”\r\n\r\n“Here was buried Caedwalla, called also Peter, king of the Saxons, on the\r\ntwentieth day of April, in the second indiction, aged about thirty years,\r\nin the reign of our most pious lord, the Emperor Justinian,(800) in the\r\nfourth year of his consulship, in the second year of the pontificate of\r\nour Apostolic lord, Pope Sergius.”\r\n\r\nWhen Caedwalla went to Rome, Ini(801) succeeded to the kingdom, being of\r\nthe blood royal; and having reigned thirty-seven years over that nation,\r\nhe in like manner left his kingdom and committed it to younger men, and\r\nwent away to the threshold of the blessed Apostles, at the time when\r\nGregory(802) was pope, being desirous to spend some part of his pilgrimage\r\nupon earth in the neighbourhood of the holy places, that he might obtain\r\nto be more readily received into the fellowship of the saints in heaven.\r\nThis same thing, about that time, was wont to be done most zealously by\r\nmany of the English nation, nobles and commons, laity and clergy, men and\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. VIII. How, when Archbishop Theodore died, Bertwald succeeded him as\r\narchbishop, and, among many others whom he ordained, he made the learned\r\nTobias bishop of the church of Rochester. [690 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year after that in which Caedwalla died at Rome, that is, 690 after\r\nthe Incarnation of our Lord, Archbishop Theodore, of blessed memory,\r\ndeparted this life, being old and full of days, for he was eighty-eight\r\nyears of age; which number of years he had been wont long before to\r\nforetell to his friends that he should live, the same having been revealed\r\nto him in a dream. He held the bishopric twenty-two years,(803) and was\r\nburied in St. Peter’s church,(804) where all the bodies of the bishops of\r\nCanterbury are buried. Of whom, as well as of his fellows of the same\r\ndegree, it may rightly and truly be said, that their bodies are buried in\r\npeace, and their names shall live to all generations. For to say all in\r\nfew words, the English Churches gained more spiritual increase while he\r\nwas archbishop, than ever before. His character, life, age, and death, are\r\nplainly and manifestly described to all that resort thither, by the\r\nepitaph on his tomb, in thirty-four heroic verses.(805) The first whereof\r\nare these:\r\n\r\n“Here in the tomb rests the body of the holy prelate, called now in the\r\nGreek tongue Theodore. Chief pontiff, blest high priest, pure doctrine he\r\nset forth to his disciples.”\r\n\r\nThe last are as follow:\r\n\r\n“For September had reached its nineteenth day, when his spirit went forth\r\nfrom the prison-bars of the flesh. Mounting in bliss to the gracious\r\nfellowship of the new life, he was united to the angelic citizens in the\r\nheights of Heaven.”\r\n\r\nBertwald(806) succeeded Theodore in the archbishopric, being abbot of the\r\nmonastery called Racuulfe,(807) which stands at the northern mouth of the\r\nriver Genlade.(808) He was a man learned in the Scriptures, and perfectly\r\ninstructed in ecclesiastical and monastic teaching, yet in no wise to be\r\ncompared to his predecessor. He was chosen bishop in the year of our Lord\r\n692,(809) on the first day of July, when Wictred and Suaebhard were kings\r\nin Kent;(810) but he was ordained the next year, on Sunday the 29th of\r\nJune, by Godwin, metropolitan bishop of Gaul,(811) and was enthroned on\r\nSunday the 31st of August. Among the many bishops whom he ordained was\r\nTobias,(812) a man instructed in the Latin, Greek, and Saxon tongues, and\r\notherwise of manifold learning, whom he consecrated in the stead of\r\nGedmund, bishop of the Church of Rochester, who had died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. IX. How the holy man, Egbert, would have gone into Germany to\r\npreach, but could not; and how Wictbert went, but because he availed\r\nnothing, returned into Ireland, whence he came. [Circ. 688 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that time the venerable servant of Christ, and priest, Egbert,(813) who\r\nis to be named with all honour, and who, as was said before, lived as a\r\nstranger and pilgrim in Ireland to obtain hereafter a country in heaven,\r\npurposed in his mind to profit many, taking upon him the work of an\r\napostle, and, by preaching the Gospel, to bring the Word of God to some of\r\nthose nations that had not yet heard it; many of which tribes he knew to\r\nbe in Germany, from whom the Angles or Saxons, who now inhabit Britain,\r\nare known to have derived their race and origin; for which reason they are\r\nstill corruptly called “Garmans”(814) by the neighbouring nation of the\r\nBritons. Such are the Frisians, the Rugini, the Danes, the Huns, the Old\r\nSaxons, and the Boructuari.(815) There are also in the same parts many\r\nother peoples still enslaved to pagan rites, to whom the aforesaid soldier\r\nof Christ determined to go, sailing round Britain, if haply he could\r\ndeliver any of them from Satan, and bring them to Christ; or if this might\r\nnot be, he was minded to go to Rome, to see and adore the thresholds of\r\nthe holy Apostles and martyrs of Christ.\r\n\r\nBut a revelation from Heaven and the working of God prevented him from\r\nachieving either of these enterprises; for when he had made choice of most\r\ncourageous companions, fit to preach the Word, inasmuch as they were\r\nrenowned for their good deeds and their learning, and when all things\r\nnecessary were provided for the voyage, there came to him on a certain day\r\nearly in the morning one of the brethren, who had been a disciple of the\r\npriest, Boisil,(816) beloved of God, and had ministered to him in Britain,\r\nwhen the said Boisil was provost of the monastery of Mailros,(817) under\r\nthe Abbot Eata, as has been said above.(818) This brother told him a\r\nvision which he had seen that night. “When after matins,” said he, “I had\r\nlaid me down in my bed, and was fallen into a light slumber, Boisil, that\r\nwas sometime my master and brought me up in all love, appeared to me, and\r\nasked, whether I knew him? I said, ‘Yes, you are Boisil.’ He answered, ‘I\r\nam come to bring Egbert a message from our Lord and Saviour, which must\r\nnevertheless be delivered to him by you. Tell him, therefore, that he\r\ncannot perform the journey he has undertaken; for it is the will of God\r\nthat he should rather go to teach the monasteries of Columba.’ ”(819) Now\r\nColumba was the first teacher of the Christian faith to the Picts beyond\r\nthe mountains northward, and the first founder of the monastery in the\r\nisland of Hii, which was for a long time much honoured by many tribes of\r\nthe Scots and Picts. The said Columba is now by some called Columcille,\r\nthe name being compounded from “Columba” and “Cella.”(820) Egbert, having\r\nheard the words of the vision, charged the brother that had told it him,\r\nnot to tell it to any other, lest haply it should be a lying vision. But\r\nwhen he considered the matter secretly with himself, he apprehended that\r\nit was true, yet would not desist from preparing for his voyage which he\r\npurposed to make to teach those nations.\r\n\r\nA few days after the aforesaid brother came again to him, saying that\r\nBoisil had that night again appeared to him in a vision after matins, and\r\nsaid, “Why did you tell Egbert so negligently and after so lukewarm a\r\nmanner that which I enjoined upon you to say? Yet, go now and tell him,\r\nthat whether he will or no, he must go to Columba’s monasteries, because\r\ntheir ploughs are not driven straight; and he must bring them back into\r\nthe right way.” Hearing this, Egbert again charged the brother not to\r\nreveal the same to any man. Though now assured of the vision, he\r\nnevertheless attempted to set forth upon his intended voyage with the\r\nbrethren. When they had put aboard all that was requisite for so long a\r\nvoyage, and had waited some days for fair winds, there arose one night so\r\nviolent a storm, that part of what was on board was lost, and the ship\r\nitself was left lying on its side in the sea. Nevertheless, all that\r\nbelonged to Egbert and his companions was saved. Then he, saying, in the\r\nwords of the prophet, “For my sake this great tempest is upon you,”(821)\r\nwithdrew himself from that undertaking and was content to remain at home.\r\n\r\nBut one of his companions, called Wictbert,(822) notable for his contempt\r\nof the world and for his learning and knowledge, for he had lived many\r\nyears as a stranger and pilgrim in Ireland, leading a hermit’s life in\r\ngreat perfection, took ship, and arriving in Frisland, preached the Word\r\nof salvation for the space of two whole years to that nation and to its\r\nking, Rathbed;(823) but reaped no fruit of all his great labour among his\r\nbarbarous hearers. Returning then to the chosen place of his pilgrimage,\r\nhe gave himself up to the Lord in his wonted life of silence, and since he\r\ncould not be profitable to strangers by teaching them the faith, he took\r\ncare to be the more profitable to his own people by the example of his\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. X. How Wilbrord, preaching in Frisland, converted many to Christ;\r\nand how his two companions, the Hewalds, suffered martyrdom. [690 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the man of God, Egbert, perceived that neither he himself was\r\npermitted to go and preach to the nations, being withheld for the sake of\r\nsome other advantage to the holy Church, whereof he had been forewarned by\r\na revelation; nor that Wictbert, when he went into those parts, had\r\navailed to do anything; he nevertheless still attempted to send holy and\r\nindustrious men to the work of the Word, among whom the most notable was\r\nWilbrord,(824) a man eminent for his merit and rank as priest. They\r\narrived there, twelve in number, and turning aside to Pippin,(825) duke of\r\nthe Franks, were gladly received by him; and as he had lately subdued the\r\nnearer part of Frisland, and expelled King Rathbed,(826) he sent them\r\nthither to preach, supporting them at the same time with his sovereign\r\nauthority, that none might molest them in their preaching, and bestowing\r\nmany favours on those who consented to receive the faith. Thus it came to\r\npass, that with the help of the Divine grace, in a short time they\r\nconverted many from idolatry to the faith of Christ.\r\n\r\nFollowing their example, two other priests of the English nation, who had\r\nlong lived as strangers in Ireland, for the sake of the eternal country,\r\nwent into the province of the Old Saxons, if haply they could there win\r\nany to Christ by their preaching. They were alike in name as in devotion,\r\nHewald being the name of both, with this distinction, that, on account of\r\nthe different colour of their hair, the one was called Black Hewald and\r\nthe other White Hewald.(827) They were both full of religious piety, but\r\nBlack Hewald was the more learned of the two in Scripture. When they came\r\ninto the province, these men took up their lodging in the guesthouse of a\r\ncertain township-reeve, and asked of him that he would conduct them to the\r\nealdorman(828) who was over him, for that they had a message concerning\r\nmatters of importance to communicate to him. For those Old Saxons have no\r\nking, but many ealdormen set over their nation; and when any war is on the\r\npoint of breaking out, they cast lots indifferently, and on whomsoever the\r\nlot falls, him they all follow and obey during the time of war; but as\r\nsoon as the war is ended, all those ealdormen are again equal in power. So\r\nthe reeve received and entertained them in his house some days, promising\r\nto send them to the ealdorman who was over him, as they desired.\r\n\r\nBut when the barbarians perceived that they were of another religion,—for\r\nthey continually gave themselves to singing of psalms and prayer, and\r\ndaily offered up to God the Sacrifice of the saving Victim, having with\r\nthem sacred vessels and a consecrated table for an altar,—they began to\r\ngrow suspicious of them, lest if they should come into the presence of\r\ntheir ealdorman, and converse with him, they should turn his heart from\r\ntheir gods, and convert him to the new religion of the Christian faith;\r\nand thus by degrees all their province should be forced to change its old\r\nworship for a new. Wherefore on a sudden they laid hold of them and put\r\nthem to death; and White Hewald they slew outright with the sword; but\r\nthey put Black Hewald to lingering torture and tore him limb from limb in\r\nhorrible fashion, and they threw their bodies into the Rhine. The\r\nealdorman, whom they had desired to see, hearing of it, was very angry\r\nthat strangers who desired to come to him had not been suffered to come;\r\nand therefore he sent and put to death all those villagers and burned\r\ntheir village. The aforesaid priests and servants of Christ suffered on\r\nthe 3rd of October.(829)\r\n\r\nMiracles from Heaven were not lacking at their martyrdom. For their dead\r\nbodies, having been cast into the river by the pagans, as has been said,\r\nwere carried against the stream for the space of almost forty miles, to\r\nthe place where their companions were. Moreover, a long ray of light,\r\nreaching up to heaven, shone every night above them wheresoever they\r\nchanced to be, and that too in the sight of the very pagans that had slain\r\nthem. Moreover, one of them appeared in a vision by night to one of his\r\ncompanions, whose name was Tilmon, a man of renown and of noble birth in\r\nthis world, who having been a thegn had become a monk, telling him that he\r\nmight find their bodies in that place, where he should see rays of light\r\nreaching from heaven to the earth. And so it befell; and their bodies\r\nbeing found, were buried with the honour due to martyrs; and the day of\r\ntheir passion or of the finding of their bodies, is celebrated in those\r\nparts with fitting veneration. Finally, Pippin, the most glorious duke of\r\nthe Franks, learning these things, caused the bodies to be brought to him,\r\nand buried them with much honour in the church of the city of Cologne, on\r\nthe Rhine.(830) And it is said that a spring burst forth in the place\r\nwhere they were killed, which to this day affords a plentiful stream in\r\nthat same place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XI. How the venerable Suidbert in Britain, and Wilbrord at Rome,\r\nwere ordained bishops for Frisland. [692 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt their first coming into Frisland, as soon as Wilbrord found that he had\r\nleave given him by the prince to preach there, he made haste to go to\r\nRome, where Pope Sergius(831) then presided over the Apostolic see, that\r\nhe might undertake the desired work of preaching the Gospel to the\r\nnations, with his licence and blessing; and hoping to receive of him some\r\nrelics of the blessed Apostles and martyrs of Christ; to the end, that\r\nwhen he destroyed the idols,(832) and erected churches in the nation to\r\nwhich he preached, he might have the relics of saints at hand to put into\r\nthem, and having deposited them there, might accordingly dedicate each of\r\nthose places to the honour of the saint whose relics they were. He desired\r\nalso there to learn or to receive many other things needful for so great a\r\nwork. Having obtained his desire in all these matters, he returned to\r\npreach.\r\n\r\nAt which time, the brothers who were in Frisland, attending on the\r\nministry of the Word, chose out of their own number a man of sober life,\r\nand meek of heart, called Suidbert,(833) to be ordained bishop for them.\r\nHe, being sent into Britain, was consecrated, at their request, by the\r\nmost reverend Bishop Wilfrid, who, having been driven out of his country,\r\nchanced then to be living in banishment among the Mercians;(834) for Kent\r\nhad no bishop at that time, Theodore being dead, and Bertwald, his\r\nsuccessor, who had gone beyond the sea to be ordained, having not yet\r\nreturned to his episcopal see.\r\n\r\nThe said Suidbert, being made bishop, returned from Britain, and not long\r\nafter departed to the Boructuari; and by his preaching brought many of\r\nthem into the way of truth; but the Boructuari being not long after\r\nsubdued by the Old Saxons, those who had received the Word were dispersed\r\nabroad; and the bishop himself with certain others went to Pippin, who, at\r\nthe request of his wife, Blithryda,(835) gave him a place of abode in a\r\ncertain island on the Rhine, called in their tongue, Inlitore;(836) there\r\nhe built a monastery, which his successors still possess, and for a time\r\ndwelt in it, leading a most continent life, and there ended his days.\r\n\r\nWhen they who had gone thither had spent some years teaching in Frisland,\r\nPippin, with the consent of them all, sent the venerable Wilbrord to Rome,\r\nwhere Sergius was still pope, desiring that he might be consecrated\r\narchbishop over the nation of the Frisians; which was accordingly done, as\r\nhe had made request, in the year of our Lord 696. He was consecrated in\r\nthe church of the Holy Martyr Cecilia,(837) on her festival; and the said\r\npope gave him the name of Clement, and forthwith sent him back to his\r\nbishopric, to wit, fourteen days after his arrival in the city.\r\n\r\nPippin gave him a place for his episcopal see, in his famous fort, which\r\nin the ancient language of those people is called Wiltaburg, that is, the\r\ntown of the Wilts; but, in the Gallic tongue, Trajectum.(838) The most\r\nreverend prelate having built a church there,(839) and preaching the Word\r\nof faith far and near, drew many from their errors, and built many\r\nchurches and not a few monasteries. For not long after he himself\r\nconstituted other bishops in those parts from the number of the brethren\r\nthat either came with him or after him to preach there; of whom some are\r\nnow fallen asleep in the Lord; but Wilbrord himself, surnamed Clement, is\r\nstill living, venerable for his great age, having been thirty-six years a\r\nbishop, and now, after manifold conflicts of the heavenly warfare, he\r\nlongs with all his heart for the recompense of the reward in Heaven.(840)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XII. How one in the province of the Northumbrians, rose from the\r\ndead, and related many things which he had seen, some to be greatly\r\ndreaded and some to be desired. [Circ. 696 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time a memorable miracle, and like to those of former days, was\r\nwrought in Britain; for, to the end that the living might be roused from\r\nthe death of the soul, a certain man, who had been some time dead, rose\r\nagain to the life of the body, and related many memorable things that he\r\nhad seen; some of which I have thought fit here briefly to describe. There\r\nwas a certain householder in that district of the Northumbrians which is\r\ncalled Incuneningum,(841) who led a godly life, with all his house. This\r\nman fell sick, and his sickness daily increasing, he was brought to\r\nextremity, and died in the beginning of the night; but at dawn he came to\r\nlife again, and suddenly sat up, whereat all those that sat about the body\r\nweeping fled away in great terror, only his wife, who loved him better,\r\nthough trembling and greatly afraid, remained with him. And he comforting\r\nher, said, “Fear not, for I am now in very deed risen from death whereof I\r\nwas holden, and permitted again to live among men; nevertheless, hereafter\r\nI must not live as I was wont, but after a very different manner.” Then\r\nrising immediately, he went to the oratory of the little town, and\r\ncontinuing in prayer till day, forthwith divided all his substance into\r\nthree parts; one whereof he gave to his wife, another to his children, and\r\nthe third, which he kept himself, he straightway distributed among the\r\npoor. Not long after, being set free from the cares of this world, he came\r\nto the monastery of Mailros,(842) which is almost enclosed by the winding\r\nof the river Tweed, and having received the tonsure, went apart into a\r\nplace of abode which the abbot had provided, and there he continued till\r\nthe day of his death, in so great contrition of mind and mortifying of the\r\nbody, that even if his tongue had been silent, his life would have\r\ndeclared that he had seen many things either to be dreaded or coveted,\r\nwhich were hidden from other men.\r\n\r\nThus he related what he had seen.(843) “He that led me had a countenance\r\nfull of light, and shining raiment, and we went in silence, as it seemed\r\nto me, towards the rising of the summer sun. And as we walked we came to a\r\nbroad and deep valley of infinite length; it lay on our left, and one side\r\nof it was exceeding terrible with raging flames, the other no less\r\nintolerable for violent hail and cold snows drifting and sweeping through\r\nall the place. Both sides were full of the souls of men which seemed to be\r\ntossed from one side to the other as it were by a violent storm; for when\r\nthey could no longer endure the fervent heat, the hapless souls leaped\r\ninto the midst of the deadly cold; and finding no rest there, they leaped\r\nback again to be burnt in the midst of the unquenchable flames. Now\r\nwhereas an innumerable multitude of misshapen spirits were thus tormented\r\nfar and near with this interchange of misery, as far as I could see,\r\nwithout any interval of rest, I began to think that peradventure this\r\nmight be Hell, of whose intolerable torments I had often heard men talk.\r\nMy guide, who went before me, answered to my thought, saying, ‘Think not\r\nso, for this is not the Hell you believe it to be.’\r\n\r\n“When he had led me farther by degrees, sore dismayed by that dread sight,\r\non a sudden I saw the place before us begin to grow dark and filled with\r\nshadows. When we entered into them, the shadows by degrees grew so thick,\r\nthat I could see nothing else, save only the darkness and the shape and\r\ngarment of him that led me. As we went on ‘through the shades in the lone\r\nnight,’(844) lo! on a sudden there appeared before us masses of foul flame\r\nconstantly rising as it were out of a great pit, and falling back again\r\ninto the same. When I had been led thither, my guide suddenly vanished,\r\nand left me alone in the midst of darkness and these fearful sights. As\r\nthose same masses of fire, without intermission, at one time flew up and\r\nat another fell back into the bottom of the abyss, I perceived that the\r\nsummits of all the flames, as they ascended were full of the spirits of\r\nmen, which, like sparks flying upwards with the smoke, were sometimes\r\nthrown on high, and again, when the vapours of the fire fell, dropped down\r\ninto the depths below. Moreover, a stench, foul beyond compare, burst\r\nforth with the vapours, and filled all those dark places.\r\n\r\n“Having stood there a long time in much dread, not knowing what to do,\r\nwhich way to turn, or what end awaited me, on a sudden I heard behind me\r\nthe sound of a mighty and miserable lamentation, and at the same time\r\nnoisy laughter, as of a rude multitude insulting captured enemies. When\r\nthat noise, growing plainer, came up to me, I beheld a crowd of evil\r\nspirits dragging five souls of men, wailing and shrieking, into the midst\r\nof the darkness, whilst they themselves exulted and laughed. Among those\r\nhuman souls, as I could discern, there was one shorn like a clerk, one a\r\nlayman, and one a woman. The evil spirits that dragged them went down into\r\nthe midst of the burning pit; and it came to pass that as they went down\r\ndeeper, I could no longer distinguish between the lamentation of the men\r\nand the laughing of the devils, yet I still had a confused sound in my\r\nears. In the meantime, some of the dark spirits ascended from that flaming\r\nabyss, and running forward, beset me on all sides, and with their flaming\r\neyes and the noisome fire which they breathed forth from their mouths and\r\nnostrils, tried to choke me; and threatened to lay hold on me with fiery\r\ntongs, which they had in their hands, yet they durst in no wise touch me,\r\nthough they assayed to terrify me. Being thus on all sides encompassed\r\nwith enemies and shades of darkness, and casting my eyes hither and\r\nthither if haply anywhere help might be found whereby I might be saved,\r\nthere appeared behind me, on the way by which I had come, as it were, the\r\nbrightness of a star shining amidst the darkness; which waxing greater by\r\ndegrees, came rapidly towards me: and when it drew near, all those evil\r\nspirits, that sought to carry me away with their tongs, dispersed and\r\nfled.\r\n\r\n“Now he, whose approach put them to flight, was the same that led me\r\nbefore; who, then turning towards the right, began to lead me, as it were,\r\ntowards the rising of the winter sun, and having soon brought me out of\r\nthe darkness, led me forth into an atmosphere of clear light. While he\r\nthus led me in open light, I saw a vast wall before us, the length on\r\neither side, and the height whereof, seemed to be altogether boundless. I\r\nbegan to wonder why we went up to the wall, seeing no door in it, nor\r\nwindow, nor any way of ascent. But when we came to the wall, we were\r\npresently, I know not by what means, on the top of it, and lo! there was a\r\nwide and pleasant plain full of such fragrance of blooming flowers that\r\nthe marvellous sweetness of the scents immediately dispelled the foul\r\nstench of the dark furnace which had filled my nostrils. So great was the\r\nlight shed over all this place that it seemed to exceed the brightness of\r\nthe day, or the rays of the noontide sun. In this field were innumerable\r\ncompanies of men clothed in white, and many seats of rejoicing multitudes.\r\nAs he led me through the midst of bands of happy inhabitants, I began to\r\nthink that this perchance might be the kingdom of Heaven, of which I had\r\noften heard tell. He answered to my thought, saying, ‘Nay, this is not the\r\nkingdom of Heaven, as you think.’\r\n\r\n“When we had also passed those mansions of blessed spirits, and gone\r\nfarther on, I saw before me a much more beautiful light than before, and\r\ntherein heard sweet sounds of singing, and so wonderful a fragrance was\r\nshed abroad from the place, that the other which I had perceived before\r\nand thought so great, then seemed to me but a small thing; even as that\r\nwondrous brightness of the flowery field, compared with this which I now\r\nbeheld, appeared mean and feeble. When I began to hope that we should\r\nenter that delightful place, my guide, on a sudden stood still; and\r\nstraightway turning, led me back by the way we came.\r\n\r\n“In our return, when we came to those joyous mansions of the white-robed\r\nspirits, he said to me, ‘Do you know what all these things are which you\r\nhave seen?’ I answered, ‘No,’ and then he said, ‘That valley which you\r\nbeheld terrible with flaming fire and freezing cold, is the place in which\r\nthe souls of those are tried and punished, who, delaying to confess and\r\namend their crimes, at length have recourse to repentance at the point of\r\ndeath, and so go forth from the body; but nevertheless because they, even\r\nat their death, confessed and repented, they shall all be received into\r\nthe kingdom of Heaven at the day of judgement; but many are succoured\r\nbefore the day of judgement, by the prayers of the living and their alms\r\nand fasting, and more especially by the celebration of Masses. Moreover\r\nthat foul flaming pit which you saw, is the mouth of Hell, into which\r\nwhosoever falls shall never be delivered to all eternity. This flowery\r\nplace, in which you see this fair and youthful company, all bright and\r\njoyous, is that into which the souls of those are received who, indeed,\r\nwhen they leave the body have done good works, but who are not so perfect\r\nas to deserve to be immediately admitted into the kingdom of Heaven; yet\r\nthey shall all, at the day of judgement, behold Christ, and enter into the\r\njoys of His kingdom; for such as are perfect in every word and deed and\r\nthought, as soon as they quit the body, forthwith enter into the kingdom\r\nof Heaven; in the neighbourhood whereof that place is, where you heard the\r\nsound of sweet singing amidst the savour of a sweet fragrance and\r\nbrightness of light. As for you, who must now return to the body, and\r\nagain live among men, if you will seek diligently to examine your actions,\r\nand preserve your manner of living and your words in righteousness and\r\nsimplicity, you shall, after death, have a place of abode among these\r\njoyful troops of blessed souls which you behold. For when I left you for\r\nawhile, it was for this purpose, that I might learn what should become of\r\nyou.’ When he had said this to me, I much abhorred returning to the body,\r\nbeing delighted with the sweetness and beauty of the place which I beheld,\r\nand with the company of those I saw in it. Nevertheless, I durst not ask\r\nmy guide anything; but thereupon, on a sudden, I found myself, I know not\r\nhow, alive among men.”\r\n\r\nNow these and other things which this man of God had seen, he would not\r\nrelate to slothful men, and such as lived negligently; but only to those\r\nwho, being terrified with the dread of torments, or ravished with the hope\r\nof everlasting joys, would draw from his words the means to advance in\r\npiety. In the neighbourhood of his cell lived one Haemgils, a monk, and\r\neminent in the priesthood, whose good works were worthy of his office: he\r\nis still living, and leading a solitary life in Ireland, supporting his\r\ndeclining age with coarse bread and cold water. He often went to that man,\r\nand by repeated questioning, heard of him what manner of things he had\r\nseen when out of the body; by whose account those few particulars which we\r\nhave briefly set down came also to our knowledge. And he related his\r\nvisions to King Aldfrid,(845) a man most learned in all respects, and was\r\nby him so willingly and attentively heard, that at his request he was\r\nadmitted into the monastery above-mentioned, and received the crown of the\r\nmonastic tonsure; and the said king, whensoever he came into those parts,\r\nvery often went to hear him. At that time the abbot and priest\r\nEthelwald,(846) a man of godly and sober life, presided over that\r\nmonastery. He now occupies the episcopal see of the church of Lindisfarne,\r\nleading a life worthy of his degree.\r\n\r\nHe had a place of abode assigned him apart in that monastery, where he\r\nmight give himself more freely to the service of his Creator in continual\r\nprayer. And inasmuch as that place was on the banks of the river, he was\r\nwont often to go into the same for the great desire he had to do penance\r\nin his body, and oftentimes to plunge in it, and to continue saying psalms\r\nor prayers in the same as long as he could endure it, standing still,\r\nwhile the waves flowed over him, sometimes up to the middle, and sometimes\r\neven to the neck in water; and when he went ashore, he never took off his\r\ncold, wet garments till they grew warm and dry on his body. And when in\r\nthe winter the cracking pieces of ice were floating about him, which he\r\nhad himself sometimes broken, to make room to stand or plunge in the\r\nriver, and those who beheld it would say, “We marvel, brother Drythelm\r\n(for so he was called), that you are able to endure such severe cold;” he\r\nanswered simply, for he was a simple and sober-spirited man, “I have seen\r\ngreater cold.” And when they said, “We marvel that you choose to observe\r\nso hard a rule of continence,” he replied, “I have seen harder things.”\r\nAnd so, until the day of his calling hence, in his unwearied desire of\r\nheavenly bliss, he subdued his aged body with daily fasting, and forwarded\r\nthe salvation of many by his words and life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XIII. How another contrarywise before his death saw a book\r\ncontaining his sins, which was shown him by devils. [704-709 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut contrarywise there was a man in the province of the Mercians, whose\r\nvisions and words, but not his manner of life, were of profit to others,\r\nthough not to himself. In the reign of Coenred,(847) who succeeded\r\nEthelred, there was a layman who was a king’s thegn, no less acceptable to\r\nthe king for his outward industry, than displeasing to him for his neglect\r\nof his own soul. The king diligently admonished him to confess and amend,\r\nand to forsake his evil ways, lest he should lose all time for repentance\r\nand amendment by a sudden death. But though frequently warned, he despised\r\nthe words of salvation, and promised that he would do penance at some\r\nfuture time. In the meantime, falling sick he betook himself to his bed,\r\nand was tormented with grievous pains. The king coming to him (for he\r\nloved the man much) exhorted him, even then, before death, to repent of\r\nhis offences. But he answered that he would not then confess his sins, but\r\nwould do it when he was recovered of his sickness, lest his companions\r\nshould upbraid him with having done that for fear of death, which he had\r\nrefused to do in health. He thought he spoke very bravely, but it\r\nafterwards appeared that he had been miserably deceived by the wiles of\r\nthe Devil.\r\n\r\nThe disease increasing, when the king came again to visit and instruct\r\nhim, he cried out straightway with a lamentable voice, “What will you now?\r\nWhat are you come for? for you can no longer do aught for my profit or\r\nsalvation.” The king answered, “Say not so; take heed and be of sound\r\nmind.” “I am not mad,” replied he, “but I now know the worst and have it\r\nfor certain before my eyes.” “What is that?” said the king. “Not long\r\nsince,” said he, “there came into this room two fair youths, and sat down\r\nby me, the one at my head, and the other at my feet. One of them drew\r\nforth a book most beautiful, but very small, and gave it me to read;\r\nlooking into it, I there found all the good actions I had ever done in my\r\nlife written down, and they were very few and inconsiderable. They took\r\nback the book and said nothing to me. Then, on a sudden, appeared an army\r\nof evil spirits of hideous countenance, and they beset this house without,\r\nand sitting down filled the greater part of it within. Then he, who by the\r\nblackness of his gloomy face, and his sitting above the rest, seemed to be\r\nthe chief of them, taking out a book terrible to behold, of a monstrous\r\nsize, and of almost insupportable weight, commanded one of his followers\r\nto bring it to me to read. Having read it, I found therein most plainly\r\nwritten in hideous characters, all the crimes I ever committed, not only\r\nin word and deed, but even in the least thought; and he said to those\r\nglorious men in white raiment who sat by me, ‘Why sit ye here, since ye\r\nknow of a surety that this man is ours?’ They answered, ‘Ye speak truly;\r\ntake him and lead him away to fill up the measure of your damnation.’ This\r\nsaid, they forthwith vanished, and two wicked spirits arose, having in\r\ntheir hands ploughshares, and one of them struck me on the head, and the\r\nother on the foot. And these ploughshares are now with great torment\r\ncreeping into the inward parts of my body, and as soon as they meet I\r\nshall die, and the devils being ready to snatch me away, I shall be\r\ndragged into the dungeons of hell.”\r\n\r\nThus spoke that wretch in his despair, and soon after died, and now in\r\nvain suffers in eternal torments that penance which he failed to suffer\r\nfor a short time with the fruits of forgiveness. Of whom it is manifest,\r\nthat (as the blessed Pope Gregory writes of certain persons) he did not\r\nsee these things for his own sake, since they did not avail him, but for\r\nthe sake of others, who, knowing of his end, should be afraid to put off\r\nthe time of repentance, whilst they have leisure, lest, being prevented by\r\nsudden death, they should perish impenitent. And whereas he saw diverse\r\nbooks laid before him by the good and evil spirits, this was done by\r\nDivine dispensation, that we may keep in mind that our deeds and thoughts\r\nare not scattered to the winds, but are all kept to be examined by the\r\nSupreme Judge, and will in the end be shown us either by friendly angels\r\nor by the enemy. And whereas the angels first drew forth a white book, and\r\nthen the devils a black one; the former a very small one, the latter one\r\nvery great; it is to be observed, that in his first years he did some good\r\nactions, all which he nevertheless obscured by the evil actions of his\r\nyouth. If, contrarywise, he had taken care in his youth to correct the\r\nerrors of his boyhood, and by well-doing to put them away from the sight\r\nof God, he might have been admitted to the fellowship of those of whom the\r\nPsalm says, “Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose\r\nsins are covered.”(848) This story, as I learned it of the venerable\r\nBishop Pechthelm,(849) I have thought good to set forth plainly, for the\r\nsalvation of such as shall read or hear it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XIV. How another in like manner, being at the point of death, saw\r\nthe place of punishment appointed for him in Hell.\r\n\r\n\r\nI myself knew a brother, would to God I had not known him, whose name I\r\ncould mention if it were of any avail, dwelling in a famous monastery, but\r\nhimself living infamously. He was oftentimes rebuked by the brethren and\r\nelders of the place, and admonished to be converted to a more chastened\r\nlife; and though he would not give ear to them, they bore with him long\r\nand patiently, on account of their need of his outward service, for he was\r\na cunning artificer. But he was much given to drunkenness, and other\r\npleasures of a careless life, and more used to stop in his workshop day\r\nand night, than to go to church to sing and pray and hear the Word of life\r\nwith the brethren. For which reason it befell him according to the saying,\r\nthat he who will not willingly humble himself and enter the gate of the\r\nchurch must needs be led against his will into the gate of Hell, being\r\ndamned. For he falling sick, and being brought to extremity, called the\r\nbrethren, and with much lamentation, like one damned, began to tell them,\r\nthat he saw Hell opened, and Satan sunk in the depths thereof; and\r\nCaiaphas, with the others that slew our Lord, hard by him, delivered up to\r\navenging flames. “In whose neighbourhood,” said he, “I see a place of\r\neternal perdition prepared for me, miserable wretch that I am.” The\r\nbrothers, hearing these words, began diligently to exhort him, that he\r\nshould repent even then, whilst he was still in the flesh. He answered in\r\ndespair, “There is no time for me now to change my course of life, when I\r\nhave myself seen my judgement passed.”\r\n\r\nWhilst uttering these words, he died without having received the saving\r\nViaticum, and his body was buried in the farthest parts of the monastery,\r\nnor did any one dare either to say Masses or sing psalms, or even to pray\r\nfor him.(850) Oh how far asunder hath God put light from darkness! The\r\nblessed Stephen, the first martyr, being about to suffer death for the\r\ntruth, saw the heavens opened, and the glory of God, and Jesus standing on\r\nthe right hand of God;(851) and where he was to be after death, there he\r\nfixed the eyes of his mind, that he might die the more joyfully. But this\r\nworkman, of darkened mind and life, when death was at hand, saw Hell\r\nopened, and witnessed the damnation of the Devil and his followers; he saw\r\nalso, unhappy wretch! his own prison among them, to the end that,\r\ndespairing of salvation, he might himself die the more miserably, but\r\nmight by his perdition afford cause of salvation to the living who should\r\nhear of it. This befell of late in the province of the Bernicians, and\r\nbeing noised abroad far and near, inclined many to do penance for their\r\nsins without delay. Would to God that this also might come to pass through\r\nthe reading of our words!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XV. How divers churches of the Scots, at the instance of Adamnan,\r\nadopted the Catholic Easter; and how the same wrote a book about the holy\r\nplaces. [703 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time a great part of the Scots in Ireland,(852) and some also of\r\nthe Britons in Britain,(853) by the grace of God, adopted the reasonable\r\nand ecclesiastical time of keeping Easter. For when Adamnan,(854) priest\r\nand abbot of the monks that were in the island of Hii, was sent by his\r\nnation on a mission to Aldfrid, king of the English,(855) he abode some\r\ntime in that province, and saw the canonical rites of the Church.\r\nMoreover, he was earnestly admonished by many of the more learned sort,\r\nnot to presume to live contrary to the universal custom of the Church,\r\neither in regard to the observance of Easter, or any other ordinances\r\nwhatsoever, with those few followers of his dwelling in the farthest\r\ncorner of the world. Wherefore he so changed his mind, that he readily\r\npreferred those things which he had seen and heard in the English\r\nchurches, to the customs which he and his people had hitherto followed.\r\nFor he was a good and wise man, and excellently instructed in knowledge of\r\nthe Scriptures. Returning home, he endeavoured to bring his own people\r\nthat were in Hii, or that were subject to that monastery, into the way of\r\ntruth, which he had embraced with all his heart; but he could not prevail.\r\nHe sailed over into Ireland,(856) and preaching to those people, and with\r\nsober words of exhortation making known to them the lawful time of Easter,\r\nhe brought back many of them, and almost all that were free from the\r\ndominion of those of Hii, from the error of their fathers to the Catholic\r\nunity, and taught them to keep the lawful time of Easter.\r\n\r\nReturning to his island, after having celebrated the canonical Easter in\r\nIreland, he was instant in preaching the Catholic observance of the season\r\nof Easter in his monastery, yet without being able to achieve his end; and\r\nit so happened that he departed this life before the next year came\r\nround,(857) the Divine goodness so ordaining it, that as he was a great\r\nlover of peace and unity, he should be taken away to everlasting life\r\nbefore he should be obliged, on the return of the season of Easter, to be\r\nat greater variance with those that would not follow him into the truth.\r\n\r\nThis same man wrote a book concerning the holy places, of great profit to\r\nmany readers; his authority was the teaching and dictation of Arculf, a\r\nbishop of Gaul,(858) who had gone to Jerusalem for the sake of the holy\r\nplaces; and having wandered over all the Promised Land, travelled also to\r\nDamascus, Constantinople, Alexandria, and many islands in the sea, and\r\nreturning home by ship, was cast upon the western coast of Britain by a\r\ngreat tempest. After many adventures he came to the aforesaid servant of\r\nChrist, Adamnan, and being found to be learned in the Scriptures, and\r\nacquainted with the holy places, was most gladly received by him and\r\ngladly heard, insomuch that whatsoever he said that he had seen worthy of\r\nremembrance in the holy places, Adamnan straightway set himself to commit\r\nto writing. Thus he composed a work, as I have said, profitable to many,\r\nand chiefly to those who, being far removed from those places where the\r\npatriarchs and Apostles lived, know no more of them than what they have\r\nlearnt by reading. Adamnan presented this book to King Aldfrid, and\r\nthrough his bounty it came to be read by lesser persons.(859) The writer\r\nthereof was also rewarded by him with many gifts and sent back into his\r\ncountry. I believe it will be of advantage to our readers if we collect\r\nsome passages from his writings, and insert them in this our History.(860)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XVI. The account given in the aforesaid book of the place of our\r\nLord’s Nativity, Passion, and Resurrection.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe wrote concerning the place of the Nativity of our Lord, after this\r\nmanner:(861) “Bethlehem, the city of David, is situated on a narrow ridge,\r\nencompassed on all sides with valleys, being a mile in length from west to\r\neast, and having a low wall without towers, built along the edge of the\r\nlevel summit. In the eastern corner thereof is a sort of natural half\r\ncave, the outward part whereof is said to have been the place where our\r\nLord was born; the inner is called the manger of our Lord. This cave\r\nwithin is all covered with rich marble, and over the particular spot where\r\nour Lord is said to have been born, stands the great church of St. Mary.”\r\nHe likewise wrote about the place of His Passion and Resurrection in this\r\nmanner: “Entering the city of Jerusalem on the north side, the first place\r\nto be visited, according to the disposition of the streets, is the church\r\nof Constantine, called the Martyrium. It was built by the Emperor\r\nConstantine, in a royal and magnificent manner, because the Cross of our\r\nLord was said to have been found there by his mother Helena. Thence, to\r\nthe westward, is seen the church of Golgotha, in which is also to be found\r\nthe rock which once bore the Cross to which the Lord’s body was nailed,\r\nand now it upholds a large silver cross, having a great brazen wheel with\r\nlamps hanging over it. Under the place of our Lord’s Cross, a crypt is\r\nhewn out of the rock, in which the Sacrifice is offered on an altar for\r\nthe dead that are held in honour, their bodies remaining meanwhile in the\r\nstreet. To the westward of this church is the round church of the\r\nAnastasis or Resurrection of our Lord, encompassed with three walls, and\r\nsupported by twelve columns. Between each of the walls is a broad passage,\r\nwhich contains three altars at three different points of the middle wall;\r\nto the south, the north, and the west. It has eight doors or entrances in\r\na straight line through the three walls; four whereof face the south-east,\r\nand four the east.(862) In the midst of it is the round tomb of our Lord\r\ncut out of the rock, the top of of which a man standing within can touch\r\nwith his hand; on the east is the entrance, against which that great stone\r\nwas set. To this day the tomb bears the marks of the iron tools within,\r\nbut on the outside it is all covered with marble to the very top of the\r\nroof, which is adorned with gold, and bears a large golden cross. In the\r\nnorth part of the tomb the sepulchre of our Lord is hewn out of the same\r\nrock, seven feet in length, and three hand-breadths above the floor; the\r\nentrance being on the south side, where twelve lamps burn day and night,\r\nfour within the sepulchre, and eight above on the edge of the right side.\r\nThe stone that was set at the entrance to the tomb is now cleft in two;\r\nnevertheless, the lesser part of it stands as an altar of hewn stone\r\nbefore the door of the tomb; the greater part is set up as another altar,\r\nfour-cornered, at the east end of the same church, and is covered with\r\nlinen cloths. The colour of the said tomb and sepulchre is white and red\r\nmingled together.”(863)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XVII. What he likewise wrote of the place of our Lord’s Ascension,\r\nand the tombs of the patriarchs.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning the place of our Lord’s Ascension, the aforesaid author writes\r\nthus. “The Mount of Olives is equal in height to Mount Sion, but exceeds\r\nit in breadth and length; it bears few trees besides vines and olives, and\r\nis fruitful in wheat and barley, for the nature of that soil is not such\r\nas to yield thickets,(864) but grass and flowers. On the very top of it,\r\nwhere our Lord ascended into heaven, is a large round church,(865) having\r\nround about it three chapels with vaulted roofs. For the inner building\r\ncould not be vaulted and roofed, by reason of the passage of our Lord’s\r\nBody; but it has an altar on the east side, sheltered by a narrow roof. In\r\nthe midst of it are to be seen the last Footprints of our Lord, the place\r\nwhere He ascended being open to the sky; and though the earth is daily\r\ncarried away by believers, yet still it remains, and retains the same\r\nappearance, being marked by the impression of the Feet. Round about these\r\nlies a brazen wheel, as high as a man’s neck, having an entrance from the\r\nwest, with a great lamp hanging above it on a pulley and burning night and\r\nday. In the western part of the same church are eight windows; and as many\r\nlamps, hanging opposite to them by cords, shine through the glass as far\r\nas Jerusalem; and the light thereof is said to thrill the hearts of the\r\nbeholders with a certain zeal and compunction. Every year, on the day of\r\nthe Ascension of our Lord, when Mass is ended, a strong blast of wind is\r\nwont to come down, and to cast to the ground all that are in the church.”\r\n\r\nOf the situation of Hebron, and the tombs of the fathers,(866) he writes\r\nthus. “Hebron, once a habitation and the chief city of David’s kingdom,\r\nnow only showing by its ruins what it then was, has, one furlong to the\r\neast of it, a double cave in the valley, where the sepulchres of the\r\npatriarchs are encompassed with a wall four-square, their heads lying to\r\nthe north. Each of the tombs is covered with a single stone, hewn like the\r\nstones of a church, and of a white colour, for the three patriarchs.\r\nAdam’s is of meaner and poorer workmanship, and he lies not far from them\r\nat the farthest end of the northern part of that wall. There are also some\r\npoorer and smaller monuments of the three women. The hill Mamre is a mile\r\nfrom these tombs, and is covered with grass and flowers, having a level\r\nplain on the top. In the northern part of it, the trunk of Abraham’s oak,\r\nbeing twice as high as a man, is enclosed in a church.”\r\n\r\nThus much, gathered from the works of the aforesaid writer, according to\r\nthe sense of his words, but more briefly and in fewer words, we have\r\nthought fit to insert in our History for the profit of readers. Whosoever\r\ndesires to know more of the contents of that book, may seek it either in\r\nthe book itself, or in that abridgement which we have lately made from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XVIII. How the South Saxons received Eadbert and Eolla, and the West\r\nSaxons, Daniel and Aldhelm, for their bishops; and of the writings of the\r\nsame Aldhelm. [705 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 705, Aldfrid, king of the Northumbrians, died(867)\r\nbefore the end of the twentieth year of his reign. His son Osred,(868) a\r\nboy about eight years of age, succeeding him in the throne, reigned eleven\r\nyears. In the beginning of his reign, Haedde, bishop of the West\r\nSaxons,(869) departed to the heavenly life; for he was a good man and a\r\njust, and his life and doctrine as a bishop were guided rather by his\r\ninnate love of virtue, than by what he had gained from books. The most\r\nreverend bishop, Pechthelm, of whom we shall speak hereafter in the proper\r\nplace,(870) and who while still deacon or monk was for a long time with\r\nhis successor Aldhelm,(871) was wont to relate that many miracles of\r\nhealing have been wrought in the place where he died, through the merit of\r\nhis sanctity; and that the men of that province used to carry the dust\r\nthence for the sick, and put it into water, and the drinking thereof, or\r\nsprinkling with it, brought health to many sick men and beasts; so that\r\nthe holy dust being frequently carried away, a great hole was made there.\r\n\r\nUpon his death, the bishopric of that province was divided into two\r\ndioceses.(872) One of them was given to Daniel,(873) which he governs to\r\nthis day; the other to Aldhelm, wherein he presided most vigorously four\r\nyears; both of them were fully instructed, as well in matters touching the\r\nChurch as in the knowledge of the Scriptures. Aldhelm, when he was as yet\r\nonly a priest and abbot of the monastery which is called the city of\r\nMaildufus,(874) by order of a synod of his own nation, wrote a notable\r\nbook(875) against the error of the Britons, in not celebrating Easter at\r\nthe due time, and in doing divers other things contrary to the purity of\r\ndoctrine and the peace of the church; and through the reading of this book\r\nmany of the Britons, who were subject to the West Saxons, were led by him\r\nto adopt the Catholic celebration of our Lord’s Paschal Feast. He likewise\r\nwrote a famous book on Virginity,(876) which, after the example of\r\nSedulius,(877) he composed in twofold form, in hexameters and in prose. He\r\nwrote some other books, being a man most instructed in all respects, for\r\nhe had a polished style,(878) and was, as I have said, of marvellous\r\nlearning both in liberal and ecclesiastical studies. On his death,\r\nForthere(879) was made bishop in his stead, and is living at this time,\r\nbeing likewise a man very learned in the Holy Scriptures.\r\n\r\nWhilst they administered the bishopric, it was determined by a synodal\r\ndecree, that the province of the South Saxons, which till that time\r\nbelonged to the diocese of the city of Winchester, where Daniel then\r\npresided, should itself have an episcopal see, and a bishop of its\r\nown.(880) Eadbert, at that time abbot of the monastery of Bishop Wilfrid,\r\nof blessed memory, called Selaeseu,(881) was consecrated their first\r\nbishop. On his death, Eolla succeeded to the office of bishop. He also\r\ndied some years ago, and the bishopric has been vacant to this day.(882)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XIX. How Coinred, king of the Mercians, and Offa, king of the East\r\nSaxons, ended their days at Rome, in the monastic habit; and of the life\r\nand death of Bishop Wilfrid. [709 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the fourth year of the reign of Osred,(883) Coenred,(884) who had for\r\nsome time nobly governed the kingdom of the Mercians, much more nobly\r\nquitted the sceptre of his kingdom. For he went to Rome, and there\r\nreceiving the tonsure and becoming a monk, when Constantine(885) was pope,\r\nhe continued to his last hour in prayer and fasting and alms-deeds at the\r\nthreshold of the Apostles. He was succeeded in the throne by Ceolred,(886)\r\nthe son of Ethelred, who had governed the kingdom before Coenred. With him\r\nwent the son of Sighere,(887) the king of the East Saxons whom we\r\nmentioned before, by name Offa, a youth of a most pleasing age and\r\ncomeliness, and greatly desired by all his nation to have and to hold the\r\nsceptre of the kingdom. He, with like devotion, quitted wife, and lands,\r\nand kindred and country, for Christ and for the Gospel, that he might\r\n“receive an hundred-fold in this life, and in the world to come life\r\neverlasting.”(888) He also, when they came to the holy places at Rome,\r\nreceived the tonsure, and ending his life in the monastic habit, attained\r\nto the vision of the blessed Apostles in Heaven, as he had long desired.\r\n\r\nThe same year that they departed from Britain, the great bishop, Wilfrid,\r\nended his days in the province called Inundalum,(889) after he had been\r\nbishop forty-five years.(890) His body, being laid in a coffin, was\r\ncarried to his monastery, which is called Inhrypum,(891) and buried in the\r\nchurch of the blessed Apostle Peter, with the honour due to so great a\r\nprelate. Concerning whose manner of life, let us now turn back, and\r\nbriefly make mention of the things which were done.(892) Being a boy of a\r\ngood disposition, and virtuous beyond his years, he conducted himself so\r\nmodestly and discreetly in all points, that he was deservedly beloved,\r\nrespected, and cherished by his elders as one of themselves.(893) At\r\nfourteen years of age he chose rather the monastic than the secular life;\r\nwhich, when he had signified to his father, for his mother was dead, he\r\nreadily consented to his godly wishes and desires, and advised him to\r\npersist in that wholesome purpose. Wherefore he came to the isle of\r\nLindisfarne, and there giving himself to the service of the monks, he\r\nstrove diligently to learn and to practise those things which belong to\r\nmonastic purity and piety; and being of a ready wit, he speedily learned\r\nthe psalms and some other books, having not yet received the tonsure, but\r\nbeing in no small measure marked by those virtues of humility and\r\nobedience which are more important than the tonsure; for which reason he\r\nwas justly loved by his elders and his equals. Having served God some\r\nyears in that monastery, and being a youth of a good understanding, he\r\nperceived that the way of virtue delivered by the Scots was in no wise\r\nperfect, and he resolved to go to Rome, to see what ecclesiastical or\r\nmonastic rites were in use at the Apostolic see. When he told the\r\nbrethren, they commended his design, and advised him to carry out that\r\nwhich he purposed. He forthwith went to Queen Eanfled, for he was known to\r\nher, and it was by her counsel and support that he had been admitted into\r\nthe aforesaid monastery, and he told her of his desire to visit the\r\nthreshold of the blessed Apostles. She, being pleased with the youth’s\r\ngood purpose, sent him into Kent, to King Earconbert,(894) who was her\r\nuncle’s son, requesting that he would send him to Rome in an honourable\r\nmanner. At that time, Honorius,(895) one of the disciples of the blessed\r\nPope Gregory, a man very highly instructed in ecclesiastical learning, was\r\narchbishop there. When he had tarried there for a space, and, being a\r\nyouth of an active spirit, was diligently applying himself to learn those\r\nthings which came under his notice, another youth, called Biscop, surnamed\r\nBenedict,(896) of the English nobility, arrived there, being likewise\r\ndesirous to go to Rome, of whom we have before made mention.\r\n\r\nThe king gave him Wilfrid for a companion, and bade Wilfrid conduct him to\r\nRome. When they came to Lyons, Wilfrid was detained there by\r\nDalfinus,(897) the bishop of that city; but Benedict hastened on to Rome.\r\nFor the bishop was delighted with the youth’s prudent discourse, the grace\r\nof his comely countenance, his eager activity, and the consistency and\r\nmaturity of his thoughts; for which reason he plentifully supplied him and\r\nhis companions with all necessaries, as long as they stayed with him; and\r\nfurther offered, if he would have it, to commit to him the government of\r\nno small part of Gaul, to give him a maiden daughter of his own\r\nbrother(898) to wife, and to regard him always as his adopted son. But\r\nWilfrid thanked him for the loving-kindness which he was pleased to show\r\nto a stranger, and answered, that he had resolved upon another course of\r\nlife, and for that reason had left his country and set out for Rome.\r\n\r\nHereupon the bishop sent him to Rome, furnishing him with a guide and\r\nsupplying plenty of all things requisite for his journey, earnestly\r\nrequesting that he would come that way, when he returned into his own\r\ncountry. Wilfrid arriving at Rome, and daily giving himself with all\r\nearnestness to prayer and the study of ecclesiastical matters, as he had\r\npurposed in his mind, gained the friendship of the most holy and learned\r\nBoniface, the archdeacon,(899) who was also counsellor to the Apostolic\r\nPope, by whose instruction he learned in their order the four Gospels, and\r\nthe true computation of Easter; and many other things appertaining to\r\necclesiastical discipline, which he could not learn in his own country, he\r\nacquired from the teaching of that same master. When he had spent some\r\nmonths there, in successful study, he returned into Gaul, to\r\nDalfinus;(900) and having stayed with him three years, received from him\r\nthe tonsure, and Dalfinus esteemed him so highly in love that he had\r\nthoughts of making him his heir; but this was prevented by the bishop’s\r\ncruel death, and Wilfrid was reserved to be a bishop of his own, that is,\r\nthe English, nation. For Queen Baldhild(901) sent soldiers with orders to\r\nput the bishop to death; whom Wilfrid, as his clerk, attended to the place\r\nwhere he was to be beheaded, being very desirous, though the bishop\r\nstrongly opposed it, to die with him; but the executioners, understanding\r\nthat he was a stranger, and of the English nation, spared him, and would\r\nnot put him to death with his bishop.\r\n\r\nReturning to Britain, he won the friendship of King Alchfrid,(902) who had\r\nlearnt to follow always and love the catholic rules of the Church; and\r\ntherefore finding him to be a Catholic, he gave him presently land of ten\r\nfamilies at the place called Stanford;(903) and not long after, the\r\nmonastery, with land of thirty families, at the place called\r\nInhrypum;(904) which place he had formerly given to those that followed\r\nthe doctrine of the Scots, to build a monastery there. But, forasmuch as\r\nthey afterwards, being given the choice, had rather quit the place than\r\nadopt the Catholic Easter and other canonical rites, according to the\r\ncustom of the Roman Apostolic Church, he gave the same to him whom he\r\nfound to be instructed in better discipline and better customs.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, by the said king’s command, he was ordained priest in\r\nthe same monastery, by Agilbert,(905) bishop of the Gewissae\r\nabove-mentioned, the king being desirous that a man of so much learning\r\nand piety should attend him constantly as his special priest and teacher;\r\nand not long after, when the Scottish sect had been exposed and\r\nbanished,(906) as was said above, he, with the advice and consent of his\r\nfather Oswy, sent him into Gaul, to be consecrated as his bishop,(907)\r\nwhen he was about thirty years of age, the same Agilbert being then bishop\r\nof the city of Paris. Eleven other bishops met at the consecration of the\r\nnew bishop, and that function was most honourably performed. Whilst he yet\r\ntarried beyond the sea, the holy man, Ceadda,(908) was consecrated bishop\r\nof York(909) by command of King Oswy, as has been said above; and having\r\nnobly ruled that church three years, he retired to take charge of his\r\nmonastery of Laestingaeu, and Wilfrid was made bishop of all the province\r\nof the Northumbrians.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, in the reign of Egfrid, he was expelled from his bishopric,\r\nand others were consecrated bishops in his stead, of whom mention has been\r\nmade above.(910) Designing to go to Rome, to plead his cause before the\r\nApostolic Pope, he took ship, and was driven by a west wind into\r\nFrisland,(911) and honourably received by that barbarous people and their\r\nKing Aldgils, to whom he preached Christ, and he instructed many thousands\r\nof them in the Word of truth, washing them from the defilement of their\r\nsins in the Saviour’s font. Thus he began there the work of the Gospel\r\nwhich was afterwards finished with great devotion by the most reverend\r\nbishop of Christ, Wilbrord.(912) Having spent the winter there\r\nsuccessfully among this new people of God, he set out again on his way to\r\nRome,(913) where his cause being tried before Pope Agatho and many\r\nbishops,(914) he was by the judgement of them all acquitted of all blame,\r\nand declared worthy of his bishopric.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the said Pope Agatho assembling a synod at Rome, of one\r\nhundred and twenty-five bishops, against those who asserted that there was\r\nonly one will and operation in our Lord and Saviour,(915) ordered Wilfrid\r\nalso to be summoned, and, sitting among the bishops, to declare his own\r\nfaith and the faith of the province or island whence he came; and he and\r\nhis people being found orthodox in their faith, it was thought fit to\r\nrecord the same among the acts of that synod, which was done in in this\r\nmanner: “Wilfrid, the beloved of God, bishop of the city of York,\r\nappealing to the Apostolic see, and being by that authority acquitted of\r\nevery thing, whether specified against him or not, and being appointed to\r\nsit in judgement with one hundred and twenty-five other bishops in the\r\nsynod, made confession of the true and catholic faith, and confirmed the\r\nsame with his subscription in the name of all the northern part of Britain\r\nand Ireland, and the islands inhabited by the nations of the English and\r\nBritons, as also by the Scots and Picts.”\r\n\r\nAfter this, returning into Britain,(916) he converted the province of the\r\nSouth Saxons from their idolatrous worship to the faith of Christ.(917) He\r\nalso sent ministers of the Word to the Isle of Wight;(918) and in the\r\nsecond year of Aldfrid, who reigned after Egfrid, was restored to his see\r\nand bishopric by that king’s invitation.(919) Nevertheless, five years\r\nafter, being again accused, he was deprived of his bishopric by the same\r\nking and certain bishops.(920) Coming to Rome,(921) he was allowed to make\r\nhis defence in the presence of his accusers, before a number of bishops\r\nand the Apostolic Pope John.(922) It was shown by the judgement of them\r\nall, that his accusers had in part laid false accusations to his charge;\r\nand the aforesaid Pope wrote to the kings of the English, Ethelred and\r\nAldfrid, to cause him to be restored to his bishopric, because he had been\r\nunjustly condemned.(923)\r\n\r\nHis acquittal was much forwarded by the reading of the acts of the synod\r\nof Pope Agatho,(924) of blessed memory, which had been formerly held, when\r\nWilfrid was in Rome and sat in council among the bishops, as has been said\r\nbefore. For the acts of that synod being, as the case required, read, by\r\norder of the Apostolic Pope, before the nobility and a great number of the\r\npeople for some days, they came to the place where it was written,\r\n“Wilfrid, the beloved of God, bishop of the city of York, appealing to the\r\nApostolic see, and being by that authority acquitted of everything,\r\nwhether specified against him or not,” and the rest as above stated. This\r\nbeing read, the hearers were amazed, and the reader ceasing, they began to\r\nask of one another, who that Bishop Wilfrid was. Then Boniface, the Pope’s\r\ncounsellor,(925) and many others, who had seen him there in the days of\r\nPope Agatho, said that he was the same bishop that lately came to Rome, to\r\nbe tried by the Apostolic see, being accused by his people, and “who, said\r\nthey, having long since come here upon the like accusation, the cause and\r\ncontention of both parties being heard and examined, was proved by Pope\r\nAgatho, of blessed memory, to have been wrongfully expelled from his\r\nbishopric, and was held in such honour by him, that he commanded him to\r\nsit in the council of bishops which he had assembled, as a man of\r\nuntainted faith and an upright mind.” This being heard, the Pope and all\r\nthe rest said, that a man of so great authority, who had held the office\r\nof a bishop for nearly forty years, ought by no means to be condemned, but\r\nbeing altogether cleared of the faults laid to his charge, should return\r\nhome with honour.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to Gaul, on his way back to Britain, on a sudden he fell\r\nsick, and the sickness increasing, he was so weighed down by it, that he\r\ncould not ride, but was carried in his bed by the hands of his servants.\r\nBeing thus come to the city of Maeldum,(926) in Gaul, he lay four days and\r\nnights, as if he had been dead, and only by his faint breathing showed\r\nthat he had any life in him. Having continued thus four days, without meat\r\nor drink, without speech or hearing, at length, on the fifth day, at\r\ndaybreak, as it were awakening out of a deep sleep, he raised himself and\r\nsat up, and opening his eyes, saw round about him a company of brethren\r\nsinging psalms and weeping. Sighing gently, he asked where Acca,(927) the\r\npriest, was. This man, straightway being called, came in, and seeing him\r\nsomewhat recovered and able to speak, knelt down, and gave thanks to God,\r\nwith all the brethren there present. When they had sat awhile and begun to\r\ndiscourse, with great awe, of the judgements of heaven, the bishop bade\r\nthe rest go out for a time, and spoke to the priest, Acca, after this\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\n“A dread vision has even now appeared to me, which I would have you hear\r\nand keep secret, till I know what God will please to do with me. There\r\nstood by me a certain one, glorious in white raiment, and he told me that\r\nhe was Michael, the Archangel, and said, ‘I am sent to call you back from\r\ndeath: for the Lord has granted you life, through the prayers and tears of\r\nyour disciples and brethren, and the intercession of His Blessed Mother\r\nMary, of perpetual virginity; wherefore I tell you, that you shall now\r\nrecover from this sickness; but be ready, for I will return and visit you\r\nat the end of four years. And when you come into your country, you shall\r\nrecover the greater part of the possessions that have been taken from you,\r\nand shall end your days in peace and quiet.’ ” The bishop accordingly\r\nrecovered, whereat all men rejoiced and gave thanks to God, and setting\r\nforward on his journey, he arrived in Britain.\r\n\r\nHaving read the letters which he brought from the Apostolic Pope,\r\nBertwald, the archbishop, and Ethelred,(928) sometime king, but then\r\nabbot, readily took his part; for the said Ethelred, calling to him\r\nCoenred,(929) whom he had made king in his own stead, begged him to be\r\nfriends with Wilfrid, in which request he prevailed; nevertheless Aldfrid,\r\nking of the Northumbrians, disdained to receive him. But he died soon\r\nafter,(930) and so it came to pass that, during the reign of his son\r\nOsred,(931) when a synod was assembled before long by the river Nidd,(932)\r\nafter some contention on both sides, at length, by the consent of all, he\r\nwas restored to the government of his own church;(933) and thus he lived\r\nin peace four years, till the day of his death. He died in his monastery,\r\nwhich he had in the province of Undalum,(934) under the government of the\r\nAbbot Cuthbald;(935) and by the ministry of the brethren, he was carried\r\nto his first monastery which is called Inhrypum,(936) and buried in the\r\nchurch of the blessed Apostle Peter, hard by the altar on the south side,\r\nas has been mentioned above, and this epitaph was written over him:\r\n\r\n“Here rests the body of the great Bishop Wilfrid, who, for love of piety,\r\nbuilt these courts and consecrated them with the noble name of Peter, to\r\nwhom Christ, the Judge of all the earth, gave the keys of Heaven. And\r\ndevoutly he clothed them with gold and Tyrian purple; yea, and he placed\r\nhere the trophy of the Cross, of shining ore, uplifted high; moreover he\r\ncaused the four books of the Gospel to be written in gold in their order,\r\nand he gave a case meet for them of ruddy gold. And he also brought the\r\nholy season of Easter, returning in its course, to accord with the true\r\nteaching of the catholic rule which the Fathers fixed, and, banishing all\r\ndoubt and error, gave his nation sure guidance in their worship. And in\r\nthis place he gathered a great throng of monks, and with all diligence\r\nsafeguarded the precepts which the Fathers’ rule enjoined. And long time\r\nsore vexed by many a peril at home and abroad, when he had held the office\r\nof a bishop forty-five years, he passed away and with joy departed to the\r\nheavenly kingdom. Grant, O Jesus, that the flock may follow in the path of\r\nthe shepherd.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XX. How Albinus succeeded to the godly Abbot Hadrian, and Acca to\r\nBishop Wilfrid. [709 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next year after the death of the aforesaid father,(937) which was the\r\nfifth year of King Osred, the most reverend father, Abbot Hadrian,(938)\r\nfellow labourer in the Word of God with Bishop Theodore(939) of blessed\r\nmemory, died, and was buried in the church of the Blessed Mother of God,\r\nin his own monastery,(940) this being the forty-first year after he was\r\nsent by Pope Vitalian with Theodore, and the thirty-ninth after his\r\narrival in England. Among other proofs of his learning, as well as\r\nTheodore’s, there is this testimony, that Albinus,(941) his disciple, who\r\nsucceeded him in the government of his monastery, was so well instructed\r\nin literary studies, that he had no small knowledge of the Greek tongue,\r\nand knew the Latin as well as the English, which was his native language.\r\n\r\nAcca,(942) his priest, succeeded Wilfrid in the bishopric of the church of\r\nHagustald, being likewise a man of zeal and great in noble works in the\r\nsight of God and man. He enriched the structure of his church, which is\r\ndedicated in honour of the blessed Apostle Andrew with manifold adornments\r\nand marvellous workmanship. For he gave all diligence, as he does to this\r\nday, to procure relics of the blessed Apostles and martyrs of Christ from\r\nall parts, and to raise altars in their honour in separate side-chapels\r\nbuilt for the purpose within the walls of the same church. Besides which,\r\nhe industriously gathered the histories of their martyrdom, together with\r\nother ecclesiastical writings, and erected there a large and noble\r\nlibrary. He likewise carefully provided holy vessels, lamps, and other\r\nsuch things as appertain to the adorning of the house of God. He in like\r\nmanner invited to him a notable singer called Maban,(943) who had been\r\ntaught to sing by the successors of the disciples of the blessed Pope\r\nGregory in Kent, to instruct himself and his clergy, and kept him twelve\r\nyears, to the end that he might teach such Church music as they did not\r\nknow, and by his teaching restore to its former state that which was\r\ncorrupted either by long use, or through neglect. For Bishop Acca himself\r\nwas a most skilful singer, as well as most learned in Holy Writ, sound in\r\nthe confession of the catholic faith, and well versed in the rules of\r\necclesiastical custom; nor does he cease to walk after this manner, till\r\nhe receive the rewards of his pious devotion. For he was brought up from\r\nboyhood and instructed among the clergy of the most holy and beloved of\r\nGod, Bosa, bishop of York.(944) Afterwards, coming to Bishop Wilfrid in\r\nthe hope of a better plan of life, he spent the rest of his days in\r\nattendance on him till that bishop’s death, and going with him to Rome,\r\nlearned there many profitable things concerning the ordinances of the Holy\r\nChurch, which he could not have learned in his own country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXI. How the Abbot Ceolfrid sent master-builders to the King of the\r\nPicts to build a church, and with them an epistle concerning the Catholic\r\nEaster and the Tonsure. [710 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that time,(945) Naiton, King of the Picts, who inhabit the northern\r\nparts of Britain, taught by frequent meditation on the ecclesiastical\r\nwritings, renounced the error whereby he and his nation had been holden\r\ntill then, touching the observance of Easter, and brought himself and all\r\nhis people to celebrate the catholic time of our Lord’s Resurrection. To\r\nthe end that he might bring this to pass with the more ease and greater\r\nauthority, he sought aid from the English, whom he knew to have long since\r\nframed their religion after the example of the holy Roman Apostolic\r\nChurch. Accordingly, he sent messengers to the venerable Ceolfrid,(946)\r\nabbot of the monastery of the blessed Apostles, Peter and Paul, which\r\nstands at the mouth of the river Wear, and near the river Tyne, at the\r\nplace called Ingyruum,(947) which he gloriously governed after\r\nBenedict,(948) of whom we have before spoken; desiring, that he would send\r\nhim a letter of exhortation, by the help of which he might the better\r\nconfute those that presumed to keep Easter out of the due time; as also\r\nconcerning the form and manner of tonsure whereby the clergy should be\r\ndistinguished,(949) notwithstanding that he himself had no small knowledge\r\nof these things. He also prayed to have master-builders sent him to build\r\na church of stone in his nation after the Roman manner,(950) promising to\r\ndedicate the same in honour of the blessed chief of the Apostles.\r\nMoreover, he and all his people, he said, would always follow the custom\r\nof the holy Roman Apostolic Church, in so far as men so distant from the\r\nspeech and nation of the Romans could learn it. The most reverend Abbot\r\nCeolfrid favourably receiving his godly desires and requests, sent the\r\nbuilders he desired, and likewise the following letter:(951)\r\n\r\n“_To the most excellent lord, and glorious King Naiton, Abbot Ceolfrid,\r\ngreeting in the Lord._ We most readily and willingly endeavour, according\r\nto your desire, to make known to you the catholic observance of holy\r\nEaster, according to what we have learned of the Apostolic see, even as\r\nyou, most devout king, in your godly zeal, have requested of us. For we\r\nknow, that whensoever the lords of this world labour to learn, and to\r\nteach and to guard the truth, it is a gift of God to his Holy Church. For\r\na certain profane writer(952) has most truly said, that the world would be\r\nmost happy if either kings were philosophers, or philosophers were kings.\r\nNow if a man of this world could judge truly of the philosophy of this\r\nworld, and form a right choice concerning the state of this world, how\r\nmuch more is it to be desired, and most earnestly to be prayed for by such\r\nas are citizens of the heavenly country, and strangers and pilgrims in\r\nthis world, that the more powerful any are in the world the more they may\r\nstrive to hearken to the commands of Him who is the Supreme Judge, and by\r\ntheir example and authority may teach those that are committed to their\r\ncharge, to keep the same, together with themselves.\r\n\r\n“There are then three rules given in the Sacred Writings, whereby the time\r\nof keeping Easter has been appointed for us and may in no wise be changed\r\nby any authority of man; two whereof are divinely established in the law\r\nof Moses; the third is added in the Gospel by reason of the Passion and\r\nResurrection of our Lord. For the law enjoined, that the Passover should\r\nbe kept in the first month of the year, and the third week of that month,\r\nthat is, from the fifteenth day to the one-and-twentieth. It is added, by\r\nApostolic institution, from the Gospel, that we are to wait for the Lord’s\r\nday in that third week, and to keep the beginning of the Paschal season on\r\nthe same. Which threefold rule whosoever shall rightly observe, will never\r\nerr in fixing the Paschal feast. But if you desire to be more plainly and\r\nfully informed in all these particulars, it is written in Exodus, where\r\nthe people of Israel, being about to be delivered out of Egypt, are\r\ncommanded to keep the first Passover,(953) that the Lord spake unto Moses\r\nand Aaron, saying, ‘This month shall be unto you the beginning of months;\r\nit shall be the first month of the year to you. Speak ye unto all the\r\ncongregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall\r\ntake to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a\r\nlamb for an house.’ And a little after,(954) ‘And ye shall keep it up\r\nuntil the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the\r\ncongregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.’ By which words it\r\nmost plainly appears, that in the Paschal observance, though mention is\r\nmade of the fourteenth day, yet it is not commanded that the Passover be\r\nkept on that day; but on the evening of the fourteenth day, that is, when\r\nthe fifteenth moon, which is the beginning of the third week, appears in\r\nthe sky, it is commanded that the lamb be killed; and that it was the\r\nnight of the fifteenth moon, when the Egyptians were smitten and Israel\r\nwas redeemed from long captivity. He says,(955) ‘Seven days shall ye eat\r\nunleavened bread.’ By which words all the third week of that same first\r\nmonth is appointed to be a solemn feast. But lest we should think that\r\nthose same seven days were to be reckoned from the fourteenth to the\r\ntwentieth, He forthwith adds,(956) ‘Even the first day ye shall put away\r\nleaven out of your houses; for whosoever eateth leavened bread, from the\r\nfirst day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel;’\r\nand so on, till he says,(957) ‘For in this selfsame day I will bring your\r\narmy out of the land of Egypt.’\r\n\r\n“Thus he calls that the first day of unleavened bread, in which he was to\r\nbring their army out of Egypt. Now it is evident, that they were not\r\nbrought out of Egypt on the fourteenth day, in the evening whereof the\r\nlamb was killed, and which is properly called the Passover or Phase, but\r\non the fifteenth day, as is most plainly written in the book of\r\nNumbers:(958) ‘and they departed from Rameses on the fifteenth day of the\r\nfirst month, on the morrow after the Passover the Israelites went out with\r\nan high hand.’ Thus the seven days of unleavened bread, on the first\r\nwhereof the people of the Lord were brought out of Egypt, are to be\r\nreckoned from the beginning of the third week, as has been said, that is,\r\nfrom the fifteenth day of the first month, till the end of the\r\none-and-twentieth of the same month. But the fourteenth day is named apart\r\nfrom this number, by the title of the Passover, as is plainly shown by\r\nthat which follows in Exodus:(959) where, after it is said, ‘For in this\r\nself-same day I will bring your army out of the land of Egypt;’ it is\r\nforthwith added, ‘And ye shall observe this day in your generations by an\r\nordinance for ever. In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the\r\nmonth, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one-and-twentieth day of\r\nthe month at even. Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your\r\nhouses.’ Now, who is there that does not perceive, that there are not only\r\nseven days, but rather eight, from the fourteenth to the\r\none-and-twentieth, if the fourteenth be also reckoned in the number? But\r\nif, as appears by diligent study of the truth of the Scriptures, we reckon\r\nfrom the evening of the fourteenth day to the evening of the\r\none-and-twentieth, we shall certainly find, that, while the Paschal feast\r\nbegins on the evening of the fourteenth day, yet the whole sacred\r\nsolemnity contains no more than only seven nights and as many days.\r\nWherefore the rule which we laid down is proved to be true, when we said\r\nthat the Paschal season is to be celebrated in the first month of the\r\nyear, and the third week of the same. For it is in truth the third week,\r\nbecause it begins on the evening of the fourteenth day, and ends on the\r\nevening of the one-and-twentieth.\r\n\r\n“But since Christ our Passover is sacrificed,(960) and has made the Lord’s\r\nday, which among the ancients was called the first day of the week, a\r\nsolemn day to us for the joy of His Resurrection, the Apostolic tradition\r\nhas included it in the Paschal festival; yet has decreed that the time of\r\nthe legal Passover be in no wise anticipated or diminished; but rather\r\nordains, that according to the precept of the law, that same first month\r\nof the year, and the fourteenth day of the same, and the evening thereof\r\nbe awaited. And when this day should chance to fall on a Saturday, every\r\nman should take to him a lamb, according to the house of his fathers, a\r\nlamb for an house, and he should kill it in the evening, that is, that all\r\nthe Churches throughout the world, making one Catholic Church, should\r\nprovide Bread and Wine for the Mystery of the Flesh and Blood of the\r\nspotless Lamb ‘that hath taken away the sins of the world;’(961) and after\r\na fitting solemn service of lessons and prayers and Paschal ceremonies,\r\nthey should offer up these to the Lord, in hope of redemption to come. For\r\nthis is that same night in which the people of Israel were delivered out\r\nof Egypt by the blood of the lamb; this is the same in which all the\r\npeople of God were, by Christ’s Resurrection, set free from eternal death.\r\nThen, in the morning, when the Lord’s day dawns, they should celebrate the\r\nfirst day of the Paschal festival; for that is the day on which our Lord\r\nmade known the glory of His Resurrection to His disciples, to their\r\nmanifold joy at the merciful revelation. The same is the first day of\r\nunleavened bread, concerning which it is plainly written in\r\nLeviticus,(962) ‘In the fourteenth day of the first month, at even, is the\r\nLord’s Passover. And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast\r\nof unleavened bread unto the Lord; seven days ye must eat unleavened\r\nbread. In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation.’\r\n\r\n“If therefore it could be that the Lord’s day should always happen on the\r\nfifteenth day of the first month, that is, on the fifteenth moon, we might\r\nalways celebrate the Passover at one and the same time with the ancient\r\npeople of God, though the nature of the mystery be different, as we do it\r\nwith one and the same faith. But inasmuch as the day of the week does not\r\nkeep pace exactly with the moon, the Apostolic tradition, which was\r\npreached at Rome by the blessed Peter, and confirmed at Alexandria by Mark\r\nthe Evangelist,(963) his interpreter, appointed that when the first month\r\nwas come, and in it the evening of the fourteenth day, we should also wait\r\nfor the Lord’s day, between the fifteenth and the one-and-twentieth day of\r\nthe same month. For on whichever of those days it shall fall, Easter will\r\nbe rightly kept on the same; seeing that it is one of those seven days on\r\nwhich the feast of unleavened bread is commanded to be kept. Thus it comes\r\nto pass that our Easter never falls either before or after the third week\r\nof the first month, but has for its observance either the whole of it, to\r\nwit, the seven days of unleavened bread appointed by the law, or at least\r\nsome of them. For though it comprises but one of them, that is, the\r\nseventh, which the Scripture so highly commends, saying,(964) ‘But the\r\nseventh day shall be a more holy convocation, ye shall do no servile work\r\ntherein,’ none can lay it to our charge, that we do not rightly keep\r\nEaster Sunday, which we received from the Gospel, in the third week of the\r\nfirst month, as the Law prescribes.\r\n\r\n“The catholic reason of this observance being thus explained, the\r\nunreasonable error, on the other hand, of those who, without any\r\nnecessity, presume either to anticipate, or to go beyond the term\r\nappointed in the Law, is manifest. For they that think Easter Sunday is to\r\nbe observed from the fourteenth day of the first month till the twentieth\r\nmoon, anticipate the time prescribed in the law, without any necessary\r\nreason; for when they begin to celebrate the vigil of the holy night from\r\nthe evening of the thirteenth day, it is plain that they make that day the\r\nbeginning of their Easter, whereof they find no mention in the commandment\r\nof the Law; and when they avoid celebrating our Lord’s Easter on the\r\none-and-twentieth day of the month, it is surely manifest that they wholly\r\nexclude that day from their solemnity, which the Law many times commends\r\nto be observed as a greater festival than the rest; and thus, perverting\r\nthe proper order, they sometimes keep Easter Day entirely in the second\r\nweek, and never place it on the seventh day of the third week. And again,\r\nthey who think that Easter is to be kept from the sixteenth day of the\r\nsaid month till the two-and-twentieth(965) no less erroneously, though on\r\nthe other side, deviate from the right way of truth, and as it were\r\navoiding shipwreck on Scylla, they fall into the whirlpool of Charybdis to\r\nbe drowned. For when they teach that Easter is to be begun at the rising\r\nof the sixteenth moon of the first month, that is, from the evening of the\r\nfifteenth day, it is certain that they altogether exclude from their\r\nsolemnity the fourteenth day of the same month, which the Law first and\r\nchiefly commends; so that they scarce touch the evening of the fifteenth\r\nday, on which the people of God were redeemed from Egyptian bondage, and\r\non which our Lord, by His Blood, rescued the world from the darkness of\r\nsin, and on which being also buried, He gave us the hope of a blessed rest\r\nafter death.\r\n\r\n“And these men, receiving in themselves the recompense of their error,\r\nwhen they place Easter Sunday on the twenty-second day of the month,\r\nopenly transgress and do violence to the term of Easter appointed by the\r\nLaw, seeing that they begin Easter on the evening of that day in which the\r\nLaw commanded it to be completed and brought to an end; and appoint that\r\nto be the first day of Easter, whereof no mention is any where found in\r\nthe Law, to wit, the first of the fourth week. And both sorts are\r\nmistaken, not only in fixing and computing the moon’s age, but also\r\nsometimes in finding the first month; but this controversy is longer than\r\ncan be or ought to be contained in this letter. I will only say thus much,\r\nthat by the vernal equinox, it may always be found, without the chance of\r\nan error, which must be the first month of the year, according to the\r\nlunar computation, and which the last. But the equinox, according to the\r\nopinion of all the Eastern nations, and particularly of the\r\nEgyptians,(966) who surpass all other learned men in calculation, falls on\r\nthe twenty-first day of March, as we also prove by horological\r\nobservation. Whatsoever moon therefore is at the full before the equinox,\r\nbeing on the fourteenth or fifteenth day, the same belongs to the last\r\nmonth of the foregoing year, and consequently is not meet for the\r\ncelebration of Easter; but that moon which is full after the equinox, or\r\nat the very time of the equinox, belongs to the first month, and on that\r\nday, without a doubt, we must understand that the ancients were wont to\r\ncelebrate the Passover; and that we also ought to keep Easter when the\r\nSunday comes. And that this must be so, there is this cogent reason. It is\r\nwritten in Genesis,(967) ‘And God made two great lights; the greater light\r\nto rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night.’ Or, as another\r\nedition(968) has it, ‘The greater light to begin the day, and the lesser\r\nto begin the night.’ As, therefore, the sun, coming forth from the midst\r\nof the east, fixed the vernal equinox by his rising, and afterwards the\r\nmoon at the full, when the sun set in the evening, followed from the midst\r\nof the east; so every year the same first lunar month must be observed in\r\nthe like order, so that its full moon must not be before the equinox; but\r\neither on the very day of the equinox, as it was in the beginning, or\r\nafter it is past. But if the full moon shall happen to be but one day\r\nbefore the time of the equinox, the aforesaid reason proves that such moon\r\nis not to be assigned to the first month of the new year, but rather to\r\nthe last of the preceding, and that it is therefore not meet for the\r\ncelebration of the Paschal festival.\r\n\r\n“Now if it please you likewise to hear the mystical reason in this matter,\r\nwe are commanded to keep Easter in the first month of the year, which is\r\nalso called the month of new things, because we ought to celebrate the\r\nmysteries of our Lord’s Resurrection and our deliverance, with the spirit\r\nof our minds renewed to the love of heavenly things. We are commanded to\r\nkeep it in the third week of the same month, because Christ Himself, who\r\nhad been promised before the Law, and under the Law, came with grace, in\r\nthe third age of the world, to be sacrificed as our Passover; and because\r\nrising from the dead the third day after the offering of His Passion, He\r\nwished this to be called the Lord’s day, and the Paschal feast of His\r\nResurrection to be yearly celebrated on the same; because, also, we do\r\nthen only truly celebrate His solemn festival, if we endeavour with Him to\r\nkeep the Passover, that is, the passing from this world to the Father, by\r\nfaith, hope, and charity. We are commanded to observe the full moon of the\r\nPaschal month after the vernal equinox, to the end, that the sun may first\r\nmake the day longer than the night, and then the moon may show to the\r\nworld her full orb of light; inasmuch as first ‘the Sun of righteousness,\r\nwith healing in His wings,’(969) that is, our Lord Jesus, by the triumph\r\nof His Resurrection, dispelled all the darkness of death, and so ascending\r\ninto Heaven, filled His Church, which is often signified by the name of\r\nthe moon, with the light of inward grace, by sending down upon her His\r\nSpirit. Which order of our salvation the prophet had in his mind, when he\r\nsaid ‘The sun was exalted and the moon stood in her order.’(970)\r\n\r\n“He, therefore, who shall contend that the full Paschal moon can happen\r\nbefore the equinox, disagrees with the doctrine of the Holy Scriptures, in\r\nthe celebration of the greatest mysteries, and agrees with those who trust\r\nthat they may be saved without the grace of Christ preventing them,(971)\r\nand who presume to teach that they might have attained to perfect\r\nrighteousness, though the true Light had never by death and resurrection\r\nvanquished the darkness of the world. Thus, after the rising of the sun at\r\nthe equinox, and after the full moon of the first month following in her\r\norder, that is, after the end of the fourteenth day of the same month, all\r\nwhich we have received by the Law to be observed, we still, as we are\r\ntaught in the Gospel, wait in the third week for the Lord’s day; and so,\r\nat length, we celebrate the offering of our Easter solemnity, to show that\r\nwe are not, with the ancients, doing honour to the casting off of the yoke\r\nof Egyptian bondage; but that, with devout faith and love, we worship the\r\nRedemption of the whole world, which having been prefigured in the\r\ndeliverance of the ancient people of God, was fulfilled in Christ’s\r\nResurrection, and that we may signify that we rejoice in the sure and\r\ncertain hope of our own resurrection, which we believe will likewise\r\nhappen on the Lord’s day.\r\n\r\n“Now this computation of Easter, which we set forth to you to be followed,\r\nis contained in a cycle of nineteen years, which began long since to be\r\nobserved in the Church, to wit, even in the time of the Apostles,\r\nespecially at Rome and in Egypt, as has been said above.(972) But by the\r\nindustry of Eusebius,(973) who took his surname from the blessed martyr\r\nPamphilus,(974) it was reduced to a plainer system; insomuch that what\r\ntill then used to be enjoined every year throughout all the Churches by\r\nthe Bishop of Alexandria, might, from that time forward, be most easily\r\nknown by all men, the occurrence of the fourteenth moon being regularly\r\nset forth in its course. This Paschal computation, Theophilus,(975) Bishop\r\nof Alexandria, made for the Emperor Theodosius, for a hundred years to\r\ncome. Cyril(976) also, his successor, comprised a series of ninety-five\r\nyears in five cycles of nineteen years. After whom, Dionysius Exiguus(977)\r\nadded as many more, in order, after the same manner, reaching down to our\r\nown time. The expiration of these is now drawing near, but there is at the\r\npresent day so great a number of calculators, that even in our Churches\r\nthroughout Britain, there are many who, having learned the ancient rules\r\nof the Egyptians, can with great ease carry on the Paschal cycles for any\r\nlength of time, even to five hundred and thirty-two years,(978) if they\r\nwill; after the expiration of which, all that appertains to the succession\r\nof sun and moon, month and week, returns in the same order as before. We\r\ntherefore forbear to send you these same cycles of the times to come,\r\nbecause, desiring only to be instructed respecting the reason for the\r\nPaschal time, you show that you have enough of those catholic cycles\r\nconcerning Easter.\r\n\r\n“But having said thus much briefly and succinctly, as you required,\r\nconcerning Easter, I also exhort you to take heed that the tonsure,\r\nconcerning which likewise you desired me to write to you, be in accordance\r\nwith the use of the Church and the Christian Faith. And we know indeed\r\nthat the Apostles were not all shorn after the same manner, nor does the\r\nCatholic Church now, as it agrees in one faith, hope, and charity towards\r\nGod, use one and the same form of tonsure throughout the world. Moreover,\r\nto look back to former times, to wit, the times of the patriarchs, Job,\r\nthe pattern of patience, when tribulation came upon him, shaved his\r\nhead,(979) and thus made it appear that he had used, in time of\r\nprosperity, to let his hair grow. But concerning Joseph, who more than\r\nother men practised and taught chastity, humility, piety, and the other\r\nvirtues, we read that he was shorn when he was to be delivered from\r\nbondage,(980) by which it appears, that during the time of his bondage, he\r\nwas in the prison with unshorn hair. Behold then how each of these men of\r\nGod differed in the manner of their appearance abroad, though their inward\r\nconsciences agreed in a like grace of virtue. But though we may be free to\r\nconfess, that the difference of tonsure is not hurtful to those whose\r\nfaith is pure towards God, and their charity sincere towards their\r\nneighbour, especially since we do not read that there was ever any\r\ncontroversy among the Catholic fathers about the difference of tonsure, as\r\nthere has been a contention about the diversity in keeping Easter, and in\r\nmatters of faith; nevertheless, among all the forms of tonsure that are to\r\nbe found in the Church, or among mankind at large, I think none more meet\r\nto be followed and received by us than that which that disciple wore on\r\nhis head, to whom, after his confession of Himself, our Lord said,(981)\r\n‘Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church, and the gates\r\nof Hell shall not prevail against it, and I will give unto thee the keys\r\nof the kingdom of Heaven.’ Nor do I think that any is more rightly to be\r\nabhorred and detested by all the faithful, than that which that man used,\r\nto whom that same Peter, when he would have bought the grace of the Holy\r\nGhost, said,(982) ‘Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought\r\nthat the gift of God may be purchased with money. Thou hast neither part\r\nnor lot in this word.’ Nor do we shave ourselves in the form of a crown\r\nonly because Peter was so shorn; but because Peter was so shorn in memory\r\nof the Passion of our Lord, therefore we also, who desire to be saved by\r\nthe same Passion, do with him bear the sign of the same Passion on the top\r\nof our head, which is the highest part of our body. For as all the Church,\r\nbecause it was made a Church by the death of Him that gave it life, is\r\nwont to bear the sign of His Holy Cross on the forehead, to the end, that\r\nit may, by the constant protection of His banner, be defended from the\r\nassaults of evil spirits, and by the frequent admonition of the same be\r\ntaught, in like manner, to crucify the flesh with its affections and\r\nlusts;(983) so also it behoves those, who having either taken the vows of\r\na monk, or having the degree of a clerk, must needs curb themselves the\r\nmore strictly by continence, for the Lord’s sake, to bear each one of them\r\non his head, by the tonsure, the form of the crown of thorns which He bore\r\non His head in His Passion, that He might bear the thorns and thistles of\r\nour sins, that is, that he might bear them away and take them from us; to\r\nthe end that they may show on their foreheads that they also willingly,\r\nand readily, endure all scoffing and reproach for his sake; and that they\r\nmay signify that they await always ‘the crown of eternal life, which God\r\nhath promised to them that love him,’(984) and that for the sake of\r\nattaining thereto they despise both the evil and the good of this world.\r\nBut as for the tonsure which Simon Magus is said to have used, who is\r\nthere of the faithful, I ask you, who does not straightway detest and\r\nreject it at the first sight of it, together with his magic? Above the\r\nforehead it does seem indeed to resemble a crown; but when you come to\r\nlook at the neck, you will find the crown cut short which you thought you\r\nsaw; so that you may perceive that such a use properly belongs not to\r\nChristians but to Simoniacs, such as were indeed in this life by erring\r\nmen thought worthy of the glory of an everlasting crown; but in that which\r\nis to follow this life are not only deprived of all hope of a crown, but\r\nare moreover condemned to eternal punishment.\r\n\r\n“But do not think that I have said thus much, as though I judged them\r\nworthy to be condemned who use this tonsure, if they uphold the catholic\r\nunity by their faith and works; nay, I confidently declare, that many of\r\nthem have been holy men and worthy servants of God. Of which number is\r\nAdamnan,(985) the notable abbot and priest of the followers of Columba,\r\nwho, when sent on a mission by his nation to King Aldfrid, desired to see\r\nour monastery, and forasmuch as he showed wonderful wisdom, humility, and\r\npiety in his words and behaviour, I said to him among other things, when I\r\ntalked with him, ‘I beseech you, holy brother, how is it that you, who\r\nbelieve that you are advancing to the crown of life, which knows no end,\r\nwear on your head, after a fashion ill-suited to your belief, the likeness\r\nof a crown that has an end? And if you seek the fellowship of the blessed\r\nPeter, why do you imitate the likeness of the tonsure of him whom St.\r\nPeter anathematized? and why do you not rather even now show that you\r\nchoose with all your heart the fashion of him with whom you desire to live\r\nin bliss for ever.’ He answered, ‘Be assured, my dear brother, that though\r\nI wear the tonsure of Simon, according to the custom of my country, yet I\r\ndetest and abhor with all my soul the heresy of Simon; and I desire, as\r\nfar as lies in my small power, to follow the footsteps of the most blessed\r\nchief of the Apostles.’ I replied, ‘I verily believe it; nevertheless it\r\nis a token that you embrace in your inmost heart whatever is of Peter the\r\nApostle, if you also observe in outward form that which you know to be\r\nhis. For I think your wisdom easily discerns that it is much better to\r\nestrange from your countenance, already dedicated to God, the fashion of\r\nhis countenance whom with all your heart you abhor, and of whose hideous\r\nface you would shun the sight; and, on the other hand, that it beseems you\r\nto imitate the manner of his appearance, whom you seek to have for your\r\nadvocate before God, even as you desire to follow his actions and his\r\nteaching.’\r\n\r\n“This I said at that time to Adamnan, who indeed showed how much he had\r\nprofited by seeing the ordinances of our Churches, when, returning into\r\nScotland,(986) he afterwards by his preaching led great numbers of that\r\nnation to the catholic observance of the Paschal time; though he was not\r\nyet able to bring back to the way of the better ordinance the monks that\r\nlived in the island of Hii over whom he presided with the special\r\nauthority of a superior. He would also have been mindful to amend the\r\ntonsure, if his influence had availed so far.\r\n\r\n“But I now also admonish your wisdom, O king, that together with the\r\nnation, over which the King of kings, and Lord of lords, has placed you,\r\nyou strive to observe in all points those things which are in accord with\r\nthe unity of the Catholic and Apostolic Church; for so it will come to\r\npass, that after you have held sway in a temporal kingdom, the blessed\r\nchief of the Apostles will also willingly open to you and yours with all\r\nthe elect the entrance into the heavenly kingdom. The grace of the eternal\r\nKing preserve you in safety, long reigning for the peace of us all, my\r\ndearly beloved son in Christ.”\r\n\r\nThis letter having been read in the presence of King Naiton and many\r\nlearned men, and carefully interpreted into his own language by those who\r\ncould understand it, he is said to have much rejoiced at the exhortation\r\nthereof; insomuch that, rising from among his nobles that sat about him,\r\nhe knelt on the ground, giving thanks to God that he had been found worthy\r\nto receive such a gift from the land of the English. “And indeed,” he\r\nsaid, “I knew before, that this was the true celebration of Easter, but\r\nnow I so fully learn the reason for observing this time, that I seem in\r\nall points to have known but little before concerning these matters.\r\nTherefore I publicly declare and protest to you that are here present,\r\nthat I will for ever observe this time of Easter, together with all my\r\nnation; and I do decree that this tonsure, which we have heard to be\r\nreasonable, shall be received by all clerks in my kingdom.” Without delay\r\nhe accomplished by his royal authority what he had said. For straightway\r\nthe Paschal cycles of nineteen years were sent by command of the State\r\nthroughout all the provinces of the Picts to be transcribed, learned, and\r\nobserved, the erroneous cycles of eighty-four years being everywhere\r\nblotted out.(987) All the ministers of the altar and monks were shorn\r\nafter the fashion of the crown; and the nation thus reformed, rejoiced, as\r\nbeing newly put under the guidance of Peter, the most blessed chief of the\r\nApostles, and committed to his protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXII. How the monks of Hii, and the monasteries subject to them,\r\nbegan to celebrate the canonical Easter at the preaching of Egbert. [716\r\nA.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNot long after, those monks also of the Scottish nation, who lived in the\r\nisle of Hii, with the other monasteries that were subject to them, were by\r\nthe Lord’s doing brought to the canonical observance with regard to\r\nEaster, and the tonsure. For in the year of our Lord 716, when Osred(988)\r\nwas slain, and Coenred(989) took upon him the government of the kingdom of\r\nthe Northumbrians, the father and priest,(990) Egbert, beloved of God, and\r\nworthy to be named with all honour, whom we have before often mentioned,\r\ncame to them from Ireland, and was honourably and joyfully received. Being\r\na most gracious teacher, and most devout in practising those things which\r\nhe taught, and being willingly heard by all, by his pious and diligent\r\nexhortations, he converted them from that deep-rooted tradition of their\r\nfathers, of whom may be said those words of the Apostle, “That they had a\r\nzeal of God, but not according to knowledge.”(991) He taught them to\r\ncelebrate the principal solemnity after the catholic and apostolic manner,\r\nas has been said, wearing on their heads the figure of an unending\r\ncrown.(992) It is manifest that this came to pass by a wonderful\r\ndispensation of the Divine goodness; to the end, that the same nation\r\nwhich had willingly, and without grudging, taken heed to impart to the\r\nEnglish people that learning which it had in the knowledge of God, should\r\nafterwards, by means of the English nation, be brought, in those things\r\nwhich it had not, to a perfect rule of life. Even as, contrarywise, the\r\nBritons, who would not reveal to the English the knowledge which they had\r\nof the Christian faith, now, when the English people believe, and are in\r\nall points instructed in the rule of the Catholic faith, still persist in\r\ntheir errors, halting and turned aside from the true path, expose their\r\nheads without a crown, and keep the Feast of Christ apart from the\r\nfellowship of the Church of Christ.(993)\r\n\r\nThe monks of Hii, at the teaching of Egbert, adopted the catholic manner\r\nof conversation, under Abbot Dunchad, about eighty years after they had\r\nsent Bishop Aidan to preach to the English nation.(994) The man of God,\r\nEgbert, remained thirteen years in the aforesaid island, which he had thus\r\nconsecrated to Christ, as it were, by a new ray of the grace of fellowship\r\nand peace in the Church; and in the year of our Lord 729, in which Easter\r\nwas celebrated on the 24th of April, when he had celebrated the solemnity\r\nof the Mass, in memory of the Resurrection of our Lord, that same day he\r\ndeparted to the Lord and thus finished, or rather never ceases endlessly\r\nto celebrate, with our Lord, and the Apostles, and the other citizens of\r\nheaven, the joy of that greatest festival, which he had begun with the\r\nbrethren, whom he had converted to the grace of unity. And it was a\r\nwonderful dispensation of the Divine Providence, that the venerable man\r\npassed from this world to the Father, not only at Easter, but also when\r\nEaster was celebrated on that day,(995) on which it had never been wont to\r\nbe celebrated in those parts. The brethren rejoiced in the sure and\r\ncatholic knowledge of the time of Easter, and were glad in that their\r\nfather, by whom they had been brought into the right way, passing hence to\r\nthe Lord should plead for them. He also gave thanks that he had so long\r\ncontinued in the flesh, till he saw his hearers accept and keep with him\r\nas Easter that day which they had ever before avoided. Thus the most\r\nreverend father being assured of their amendment, rejoiced to see the day\r\nof the Lord, and he saw it and was glad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXIII. Of the present state of the English nation, or of all\r\nBritain. [725-731 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 725, being the seventh year of Osric,(996) king of\r\nthe Northumbrians, who had succeeded Coenred, Wictred,(997) the son of\r\nEgbert, king of Kent, died on the 23rd of April, and left his three sons,\r\nEthelbert, Eadbert, and Alric,(998) heirs of that kingdom, which he had\r\ngoverned thirty-four years and a half. The next year Tobias,(999) bishop\r\nof the church of Rochester, died, a most learned man, as has been said\r\nbefore; for he was disciple to those masters of blessed memory, Theodore,\r\nthe archbishop, and Abbot Hadrian, wherefore, as has been said, besides\r\nhaving a great knowledge of letters both ecclesiastical and general, he\r\nlearned both the Greek and Latin tongues to such perfection, that they\r\nwere as well known and familiar to him as his native language. He was\r\nburied in the chapel of St. Paul the Apostle, which he had built within\r\nthe church of St. Andrew(1000) for his own place of burial. After him\r\nAldwulf(1001) took upon him the office of bishop, having been consecrated\r\nby Archbishop Bertwald.\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 729, two comets appeared about the sun, to the\r\ngreat terror of the beholders. One of them went before the sun in the\r\nmorning at his rising, the other followed him when he set in the evening,\r\nas it were presaging dire disaster to both east and west; or without doubt\r\none was the forerunner of the day, and the other of the night, to signify\r\nthat mortals were threatened with calamities at both times. They carried\r\ntheir flaming brands towards the north, as it were ready to kindle a\r\nconflagration. They appeared in January, and continued nearly a fortnight.\r\nAt which time a grievous blight fell upon Gaul, in that it was laid waste\r\nby the Saracens with cruel bloodshed; but not long after in that country\r\nthey received the due reward of their unbelief.(1002) In that year the\r\nholy man of God, Egbert, departed to the Lord, as has been said above, on\r\nEaster day;(1003) and immediately after Easter, that is, on the 9th of\r\nMay, Osric,(1004) king of the Northumbrians, departed this life, after he\r\nhad reigned eleven years, and appointed Ceolwulf,(1005) brother to\r\nCoenred,(1006) who had reigned before him, his successor; the beginning\r\nand progress of whose reign have been so filled with many and great\r\ncommotions and conflicts, that it cannot yet be known what is to be said\r\nconcerning them, or what end they will have.\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 731, Archbishop Bertwald died of old age, on the\r\n13th of January, having held his see thirty-seven years, six months and\r\nfourteen days.(1007) In his stead, the same year, Tatwine,(1008) of the\r\nprovince of the Mercians, was made archbishop, having been a priest in the\r\nmonastery called Briudun.(1009) He was consecrated in the city of\r\nCanterbury by the venerable men, Daniel,(1010) bishop of Winchester,\r\nIngwald of London,(1011) Aldwin of Lichfield,(1012) and Aldwulf of\r\nRochester,(1013) on Sunday, the 10th of June, being a man renowned for\r\npiety and wisdom, and of notable learning in Holy Scripture.\r\n\r\nThus at the present time,(1014) the bishops Tatwine and Aldwulf preside in\r\nthe churches of Kent; Ingwald is bishop in the province of the East\r\nSaxons. In the province of the East Angles, the bishops are Aldbert and\r\nHadulac;(1015) in the province of the West Saxons, Daniel and\r\nForthere;(1016) in the province of the Mercians, Aldwin.(1017) Among those\r\npeoples who dwell beyond the river Severn to the westward,(1018) Walhstod\r\nis bishop; in the province of the Hwiccas, Wilfrid;(1019) in the province\r\nof Lindsey, Bishop Cynibert(1020) presides; the bishopric of the Isle of\r\nWight(1021) belongs to Daniel, bishop of the city of Winchester. The\r\nprovince of the South Saxons,(1022) having now continued some years\r\nwithout a bishop, receives episcopal ministrations from the prelate of the\r\nWest Saxons. All these provinces, and the other southern provinces, as far\r\nas the boundary formed by the river Humber, with their several kings, are\r\nsubject to King Ethelbald.(1023)\r\n\r\nBut in the province of the Northumbrians, where King Ceolwulf reigns, four\r\nbishops now preside; Wilfrid(1024) in the church of York, Ethelwald(1025)\r\nin that of Lindisfarne, Acca(1026) in that of Hagustald, Pecthelm(1027) in\r\nthat which is called the White House, which, as the number of the faithful\r\nhas increased, has lately become an episcopal see, and has him for its\r\nfirst prelate. The Pictish people also at this time are at peace with the\r\nEnglish nation, and rejoice in having their part in Catholic peace and\r\ntruth with the universal Church. The Scots(1028) that inhabit Britain,\r\ncontent with their own territories, devise no plots nor hostilities\r\nagainst the English nation. The Britons,(1029) though they, for the most\r\npart, as a nation hate and oppose the English nation, and wrongfully, and\r\nfrom wicked lewdness, set themselves against the appointed Easter of the\r\nwhole Catholic Church; yet, inasmuch as both Divine and human power\r\nwithstand them, they can in neither purpose prevail as they desire; for\r\nthough in part they are their own masters, yet part of them are brought\r\nunder subjection to the English. In these favourable times of peace and\r\ncalm,(1030) many of the Northumbrians, as well of the nobility as private\r\npersons, laying aside their weapons, and receiving the tonsure, desire\r\nrather both for themselves and their children to take upon them monastic\r\nvows, than to practise the pursuit of war. What will be the end hereof,\r\nthe next age will see. This is for the present the state of all Britain;\r\nabout two hundred and eighty-five years after the coming of the English\r\ninto Britain, and in the 731st year of our Lord, in Whose kingdom that\r\nshall have no end let the earth rejoice; and Britain being one with them\r\nin the joy of His faith, let the multitude of isles be glad, and give\r\nthanks at the remembrance of His holiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXIV. Chronological recapitulation of the whole work: also\r\nconcerning the author himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have thought fit briefly to sum up those things which have been related\r\nat length under their particular dates, that they may be the better kept\r\nin memory.(1031)\r\n\r\nIn the sixtieth year before the Incarnation of our Lord, Caius Julius\r\nCæsar, first of the Romans invaded Britain, and was victorious, yet could\r\nnot maintain the supreme power there. [I, 2.]\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord, 46, Claudius, being the second of the Romans who\r\ncame to Britain, received the surrender of a great part of the island, and\r\nadded the Orkney islands to the Roman empire. [I, 3.]\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 167, Eleuther, being made bishop at Rome, governed\r\nthe Church most gloriously fifteen years.(1032) To whom Lucius, king of\r\nBritain, sent a letter, asking to be made a Christian, and succeeded in\r\nobtaining his request. [I, 4.]\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 189, Severus, being made emperor, reigned\r\nseventeen years; he fortified Britain with a rampart from sea to sea. [I,\r\n5.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 381, Maximus, being made emperor in Britain, crossed over into\r\nGaul, and slew Gratian. [I, 9.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 409, Rome was overthrown by the Goths, from which time the\r\nRomans ceased to rule in Britain. [I, 11.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 430, Palladius was sent by Pope Celestine to the Scots that\r\nbelieved in Christ to be their first bishop. [I, 13.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 449, Marcian being made emperor with Valentinian, reigned\r\nseven years; in whose time the English, being called in by the Britons,\r\ncame into Britain. [I, 15.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 538, an eclipse of the sun came to pass on the 16th of\r\nFebruary, from the first hour until the third.(1033)\r\n\r\nIn the year 540, an eclipse of the sun came to pass on the 20th of June,\r\nand the stars appeared during almost half an hour after the third hour of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nIn the year 547, Ida(1034) began to reign; he was the founder of the royal\r\nfamily of the Northumbrians, and he reigned twelve years.\r\n\r\nIn the year 565, the priest, Columba, came out of Scotland,(1035) into\r\nBritain, to teach the Picts, and he built a monastery in the isle of Hii.\r\n[III, 4.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 596, Pope Gregory sent Augustine with monks into Britain, to\r\npreach the good tidings of the Word of God to the English nation. [I, 23.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 597, the aforesaid teachers arrived in Britain; being about\r\nthe 150th year from the coming of the English into Britain. [I, 25.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 601, Pope Gregory sent the pall into Britain to Augustine, who\r\nwas already made bishop; he sent also several ministers of the Word, among\r\nwhom was Paulinus. [I, 29.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 603, a battle was fought at Degsastan. [I, 34.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 604, the East Saxons received the faith of Christ, under King\r\nSabert, Mellitus being bishop. [II, 3.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 605, Gregory died. [II, 1.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 616, Ethelbert, king of Kent died. [II, 5.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 625, Paulinus was ordained bishop of the Northumbrians by\r\nArchbishop Justus. [II, 9.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 626, Eanfled, daughter of King Edwin, was baptized with twelve\r\nothers, on the eve of Whitsunday. [_Ib._]\r\n\r\nIn the year 627, King Edwin was baptized, with his nation, at Easter. [II,\r\n14.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 633, King Edwin being killed, Paulinus returned to Kent. [II,\r\n20.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 640, Eadbald, king of Kent, died. [III, 8.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 642, King Oswald was slain. [III, 9.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 644, Paulinus, formerly bishop of York, but then of the city\r\nof Rochester, departed to the Lord. [III, 14.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 651, King Oswin was killed, and Bishop Aidan died. [_Ibid._]\r\n\r\nIn the year 653, the Middle Angles, under their prince, Penda, were\r\nadmitted to the mysteries of the faith. [III, 21.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 655, Penda was slain, and the Mercians became Christians.\r\n[III, 24.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 664, an eclipse came to pass; Earconbert, king of Kent, died;\r\nand Colman with the Scots returned to his people; a pestilence arose;\r\nCeadda and Wilfrid were ordained bishops of the Northumbrians. [III,\r\n26-28, IV, 1.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 668, Theodore was ordained bishop. [IV, 1.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 670, Oswy, king of the Northumbrians, died. [IV, 5.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 673, Egbert, king of Kent, died; and a synod was held at\r\nHertford, in the presence of King Egfrid, Archbishop Theodore presiding:\r\nthe synod was of great profit, and its decrees are contained in ten\r\narticles. [_Ibid._]\r\n\r\nIn the year 675,(1036) Wulfhere, king of the Mercians, when he had reigned\r\nseventeen years, died and left the government to his brother Ethelred.\r\n\r\nIn the year 676, Ethelred ravaged Kent. [IV, 12.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 678, a comet appeared; Bishop Wilfrid was driven from his see\r\nby King Egfrid; and Bosa, Eata, and Eadhaed were consecrated bishops in\r\nhis stead. [_Ibid._; V, 19.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 679, Aelfwine was killed. [IV, 21.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 680, a synod was held in the plain of Haethfelth, concerning\r\nthe Catholic faith, Archbishop Theodore presiding; John, the Roman abbot,\r\nwas also present. The same year also the Abbess Hilda died at\r\nStreanaeshalch. [IV, 17, 18, 23.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 685, Egfrid, king of the Northumbrians, was slain. The same\r\nyear Hlothere, king of Kent, died. [IV, 26.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 688, Caedwald, king of the West Saxons, went to Rome from\r\nBritain. [V, 7.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 690, Archbishop Theodore died. [V, 8.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 697, Queen Osthryth was murdered by her own nobles, to wit,\r\nthe nobles of the Mercians.(1037)\r\n\r\nIn the year 698, Berctred, an ealdorman of the king of the Northumbrians,\r\nwas slain by the Picts.(1038)\r\n\r\nIn the year 704, Ethelred, after he had reigned thirty-one years over the\r\nnation of the Mercians, became a monk, and gave up the kingdom to Coenred.\r\n[V, 19.](1039)\r\n\r\nIn the year 705, Aldfrid, king of the Northumbrians, died. [V, 18.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 709, Coenred, king of the Mercians, having reigned five years,\r\nwent to Rome.

[_Ibid._]\r\n\r\nIn the year 731, Archbishop Bertwald died. [_Ibid._]\r\n\r\nThe same year Tatwine was consecrated ninth archbishop of the church of\r\nCanterbury, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Ethelbald, king of the\r\nMercians.

Having been born in the\r\nterritory of that same monastery, I was given, by the care of kinsmen, at\r\nseven years of age, to be educated by the most reverend Abbot\r\nBenedict,(1043) and afterwards by Ceolfrid,(1044) and spending all the\r\nremaining time of my life a dweller in that monastery, I wholly applied\r\nmyself to the study of Scripture; and amidst the observance of monastic\r\nrule, and the daily charge of singing in the church, I always took delight\r\nin learning, or teaching, or writing. In the nineteenth year of my age, I\r\nreceived deacon’s orders; in the thirtieth, those of the priesthood, both\r\nof them by the ministry of the most reverend Bishop John,(1045) and at the\r\nbidding of the Abbot Ceolfrid. From the time when I received priest’s\r\norders, till the fifty-ninth year of my age, I have made it my business,\r\nfor my own needs and those of my brethren, to compile out of the works of\r\nthe venerable Fathers, the following brief notes on the Holy Scriptures,\r\nand also to make some additions after the manner of the meaning and\r\ninterpretation given by them:(1046)\r\n\r\nOn the Beginning of Genesis, to the birth of Isaac and the casting out of\r\nIshmael, four books.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Tabernacle and its Vessels, and of the Vestments of the\r\nPriests, three books.\r\n\r\nOn the first part of Samuel, to the Death of Saul, three books.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Building of the Temple, of Allegorical Exposition, and\r\nother matters, two books.\r\n\r\nLikewise on the Book of Kings, thirty Questions.(1047)\r\n\r\nOn the Proverbs of Solomon, three books.\r\n\r\nOn the Song of Songs, seven books.\r\n\r\nOn Isaiah, Daniel, the twelve Prophets, and Part of Jeremiah, Divisions of\r\nChapters, collected from the Treatise of the blessed Jerome.\r\n\r\nOn Ezra and Nehemiah, three books.\r\n\r\nOn the song of Habakkuk, one book.\r\n\r\nOn the Book of the blessed Father Tobias, one Book of Allegorical\r\nExplanation concerning Christ and the Church.\r\n\r\nAlso, Chapters of Readings on the Pentateuch of Moses, Joshua, and Judges;\r\n\r\nOn the Books of Kings and Chronicles;\r\n\r\nOn the Book of the blessed Father Job;\r\n\r\nOn the Proverbs,(1048) Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs;\r\n\r\nOn the Prophets Isaiah, Ezra, and Nehemiah.\r\n\r\nOn the Gospel of Mark, four books.\r\n\r\nOn the Gospel of Luke, six books.\r\n\r\nOf Homilies on the Gospel, two books.\r\n\r\nOn the Apostle,(1049) whatsoever I have found in the works of St.\r\nAugustine I have taken heed to transcribe in order.\r\n\r\nOn the Acts of the Apostles, two books.\r\n\r\nOn the seven Catholic Epistles, a book on each.\r\n\r\nOn the Revelation of St. John, three books.\r\n\r\nLikewise, Chapters of Lessons on all the New Testament, except the Gospel.\r\n\r\nLikewise a book of Epistles to divers Persons, of which one is of the Six\r\nAges of the world; one of the Halting-places of the Children of Israel;\r\none on the words of Isaiah, “And they shall be shut up in the prison, and\r\nafter many days shall they be visited”;(1050) one of the Reason of\r\nLeap-Year, and one of the Equinox, according to Anatolius.(1051)\r\n\r\nLikewise concerning the Histories of Saints: I translated the Book of the\r\nLife and Passion of St. Felix, Confessor,(1052) from the metrical work of\r\nPaulinus, into prose; the Book of the Life and Passion of St.\r\nAnastasius,(1053) which was ill translated from the Greek, and worse\r\namended by some ignorant person, I have corrected as to the sense as far\r\nas I could; I have written the Life of the Holy Father Cuthbert,(1054) who\r\nwas both monk and bishop, first in heroic verse, and afterwards in prose.\r\n\r\nThe History of the Abbots of this monastery, in which I rejoice to serve\r\nthe Divine Goodness, to wit, Benedict, Ceolfrid, and Huaetbert,(1055) in\r\ntwo books.\r\n\r\nThe Ecclesiastical History of our Island and Nation, in five books.\r\n\r\nThe Martyrology of the Festivals of the Holy Martyrs, in which I have\r\ncarefully endeavoured to set down all whom I could find, and not only on\r\nwhat day, but also by what sort of combat, and under what judge they\r\novercame the world.\r\n\r\nA Book of Hymns in divers sorts of metre, or rhythm.\r\n\r\nA Book of Epigrams in heroic or elegiac verse.\r\n\r\nOf the Nature of Things, and of the Times, one book of each; likewise, of\r\nthe Times, one larger book.\r\n\r\nA book of Orthography arranged in Alphabetical Order.\r\n\r\nLikewise a Book of the Art of Poetry, and to it I have added another\r\nlittle Book of Figures of Speech or Tropes; that is, of the Figures and\r\nModes of Speech in which the Holy Scriptures are written.\r\n\r\nAnd I beseech Thee, good Jesus, that to whom Thou hast graciously granted\r\nsweetly to drink in the words of Thy knowledge, Thou wilt also vouchsafe\r\nin Thy loving-kindness that he may one day come to Thee, the Fountain of\r\nall wisdom, and appear for ever before Thy face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTINUATION\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Continuation of Bede._(1056)\r\n\r\nIn the year 731 King Ceolwulf was taken prisoner, and tonsured, and sent\r\nback to his kingdom; Bishop Acca was driven from his see.\r\n\r\nIn the year 732, Egbert(1057) was made Bishop of York, in the room of\r\nWilfrid.\r\n\r\n[Cynibert Bishop of Lindsey died.]\r\n\r\n[In the year of our Lord 733, Archbishop Tatwine, having received the pall\r\nby Apostolic authority, ordained Alwic(1058) and Sigfrid,(1059) bishops.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 733, there was an eclipse of the sun on the 14th day of August\r\nabout the third hour, in such wise that the whole orb of the sun seemed to\r\nbe covered with a black and gloomy shield.\r\n\r\nIn the year 734, the moon, on the 31st of January, about the time of\r\ncock-crowing, was, for about a whole hour, coloured blood-red, after which\r\na blackness followed, and she regained her wonted light.\r\n\r\nIn the year from the Incarnation of Christ, 734, bishop Tatwine died.\r\n\r\nIn the year 735, Nothelm was ordained archbishop; and bishop Egbert,\r\nhaving received the pall from the Apostolic see, was the first to be\r\nestablished as archbishop(1060) after Paulinus, and he ordained\r\nFrithbert,(1061) and Frithwald(1062) bishops; and the priest Bede\r\ndied.(1063)\r\n\r\nIn the year 737, an excessive drought rendered the land unfruitful; and\r\nCeolwulf, voluntarily receiving the tonsure, left the kingdom to\r\nEadbert.(1064)\r\n\r\nIn the year 739, Edilhart,(1065) king of the West-Saxons, died, as did\r\nArchbishop Nothelm.\r\n\r\nIn the year 740, Cuthbert(1066) was consecrated in Nothelm’s stead.\r\nEthelbald, king of the Mercians, cruelly and wrongfully wasted part of\r\nNorthumbria, their king, Eadbert, with his army, being employed against\r\nthe Picts. Bishop Ethelwald died also, and Conwulf,(1067) was consecrated\r\nin his stead. Arnwin(1068) and Eadbert(1069) were slain.\r\n\r\nIn the year 741, a great drought came upon the country. Charles,(1070)\r\nking of the Franks, died; and his sons, Caroloman and Pippin,(1071)\r\nreigned in his stead.\r\n\r\nIn the year 745, Bishop Wilfrid and Ingwald, Bishop of London, departed to\r\nthe Lord.\r\n\r\nIn the year 747, the man of God, Herefrid,(1072) died.\r\n\r\nIn the year 750, Cuthred, king of the West Saxons, rose up against king\r\nEthelbald and Oengus; Theudor and Eanred died; Eadbert added the plain of\r\nKyle and other places to his dominions.(1073)\r\n\r\nIn the year 753, in the fifth year of King Eadbert, on the 9th of\r\nJanuary,(1074) an eclipse of the sun came to pass; afterwards, in the same\r\nyear and month, on the 24th day of January, the moon suffered an eclipse,\r\nbeing covered with a gloomy, black shield, in like manner as was the sun a\r\nlittle while before.\r\n\r\nIn the year 754, Boniface,(1075) called also Winfrid, Bishop of the\r\nFranks, received the crown of martyrdom, together with fifty-three others;\r\nand Redger was consecrated archbishop in his stead, by pope Stephen.\r\n\r\nIn the year 757, Ethelbald, king of the Mercians, was treacherously and\r\nmiserably murdered, in the night, by his own guards; Beornred(1076) began\r\nhis reign; Cyniwulf,(1077) king of the West Saxons, died; and the same\r\nyear, Offa, having put Beornred to flight, sought to gain the kingdom of\r\nthe Mercians by bloodshed.\r\n\r\nIn the year 758, Eadbert, king of the Northumbrians, receiving St. Peter’s\r\ntonsure for the love of God, and to the end that he might take the\r\nheavenly country by force,(1078) left the kingdom to his son Oswulf.\r\n\r\nIn the year 755, Oswulf was wickedly murdered by his own thegns; and\r\nEthelwald, being chosen the same year by his people, entered upon the\r\nkingdom; in whose second year there was great tribulation by reason of\r\npestilence, which continued almost two years, divers grievous sicknesses\r\nraging, but more especially the disease of dysentery.\r\n\r\nIn the year 761, Oengus,(1079) king of the Picts, died; who, from the\r\nbeginning to the end of his reign, continued to be a blood-stained and\r\ntyrannical butcher; Oswin(1080) was also slain.\r\n\r\nIn the year 765, King Aluchred came to the throne.(1081)\r\n\r\nIn the year 766 A.D., Archbishop Egbert, of the royal race, and endued\r\nwith divine knowledge, as also Frithbert, both of them truly faithful\r\nbishops, departed to the Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAaron, British Martyr, 18.\r\n\r\nAaron, High Priest, 361.\r\n\r\n“Abbots, Anonymous History of the,” editorial

That\r\n      the Britons (or Brythons) came from Gaul is doubtless a fact.\r\n      Another branch of the Celtic race, the Goidels or Gaels, appears to\r\n      have been in possession in Britain before them.\r\n\r\n   29 By Scythia Bede means Scandinavia. He only mentions this account as\r\n      a tradition. The problem of the Picts has not been solved yet.\r\n      According to one view, they belonged to the pre-Aryan inhabitants of\r\n      Britain, pushed westward and northward by the Celtic invaders. In\r\n      Scotland they held their own for a considerable time in a wide tract\r\n      of country, and they may have to some extent amalgamated with the\r\n      Celts who dispossessed them (Rhŷs). Others regard them as Celts of\r\n      the same branch as Welsh, Cornish, and Britons, being probably\r\n      nearest to Cornish. The absence of all but the scantiest remains of\r\n      their language makes the question of their origin one of great\r\n      difficulty.\r\n\r\n   30 The legend is an attempt to account for the law of Pictish\r\n      succession, which was vested in the mother, _v._ Rhŷs, “Celtic\r\n      Britain,” pp. 170-171.\r\n\r\n   31 “Dal,” a division or part, is common in Irish names. Dalriada was a\r\n      district in the north-eastern part of Ulster. From there, a tribe of\r\n      Scots (a Celtic race who settled in Ireland at some unknown period)\r\n      came to Kintyre and spread along the coasts of Argyll, which took\r\n      from them the name of Dalriada (probably _circ._ 500 A.D.). They\r\n      brought the Christian religion with them. Bede follows that version\r\n      of the legend which makes Cairbre Riada, the eponymous hero of the\r\n      Irish Dalriada (_circ._ 200 A.D.), himself found the colony in\r\n      Scotland.\r\n\r\n   32 Dumbarton; _v. infra_ c. 12, p. 24 and note.\r\n\r\n   33 Caesar’s invasion took place A.U.C. 699 and 700; B.C. 55 and 54.\r\n\r\n   34 Cf. Caes., B.G., V, 11, 18 ff. A powerful British chief. His\r\n      territory lay north and north-east of the Thames, roughly comprising\r\n      Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire, and Berkshire, but the exact limits\r\n      are uncertain. His people were the Catuvellauni (the name is Gaulish\r\n      in form).\r\n\r\n   35 Cf. Caes., B.G., V, 20. The Trinovantes occupied Essex and part of\r\n      Middlesex.\r\n\r\n   36 Variations of this name given by ancient authors are Andragius and\r\n      Androgorius. Caesar calls him Mandubracius.\r\n\r\n   37 The position of this place is unknown.\r\n\r\n   38 Claudius came to Britain A.U.C. 796, 43 A.D.\r\n\r\n   39 He can only have done so in name; it was probably Agricola who first\r\n      conquered the Orkneys. Cf. Tac., Agric., 10.\r\n\r\n   40 Cf. Tac., Agric., 13.\r\n\r\n   41 Marcus Antoninus Verus, commonly called Marcus Aurelius, succeeded\r\n      in 161 A.D. His colleague in the empire was his adopted brother,\r\n      Lucius Verus, whose full adoptive name was Lucius Aurelius Antoninus\r\n      Verus Commodus. He died in 169. Eleutherus became Pope between 171\r\n      and 177. Bede’s chronology is therefore wrong.\r\n\r\n   42 Most modern authorities consider the story fabulous. But cf. Bright,\r\n      “Early English Church History,” pp. 3-5.\r\n\r\n   43 Severus succeeded in 193 A.D. He died in 211.\r\n\r\n   44 This is the earthwork which runs parallel to the wall of Hadrian,\r\n      between the Solway and the Tyne, at an interval of from 30 to 1,300\r\n      yards from it. Its origin and purpose are doubtful. Ancient\r\n      authorities afford conflicting evidence with regard to the Roman\r\n      walls in Britain. Modern research seems to show that Severus built\r\n      no wall or rampart, though some ancient historians assert that he\r\n      did (_v._ Haverfield, quoted by Plummer, _ad loc._; cf. _infra_ c.\r\n      12 and note).\r\n\r\n   45 Bassianus Antoninus, surnamed Caracalla. Geta was murdered by\r\n      Caracalla.\r\n\r\n   46 Diocletian succeeded in 284.\r\n\r\n   47 Carausius was a native of Menapia, in Belgium, appointed to command\r\n      the Roman fleet stationed at Boulogne to guard the coasts. He took\r\n      the fleet with him when he usurped imperial authority in Britain.\r\n      Maximian, failing to reduce him, recognized his authority and gave\r\n      him the title of Augustus. He governed vigorously and prosperously.\r\n\r\n   48 Allectus was a follower of Carausius. His revolt was apparently\r\n      supported by the independent tribes, probably Caledonians.\r\n\r\n   49 Asclepiodotus was serving under Constantius Chlorus (one of the\r\n      reigning Caesars), who sailed to Britain and marched against\r\n      Allectus.\r\n\r\n   50 The statement that the Diocletian persecution extended to Britain\r\n      rests on no trustworthy evidence at all. Yet though the time\r\n      assigned is probably wrong, there seems to be no reason to doubt the\r\n      existence of the British Protomartyr. The story rests upon a local\r\n      tradition traceable up to the visit of Germanus in 429 A.D., _v.\r\n      infra_ c. 18.\r\n\r\n   51 Venantius Fortunatus, a Christian poet, Bishop of Poitiers, b. 530\r\n      A.D. He was the last Latin poet of any note in Gaul.\r\n\r\n   52 In the lives of St. Alban (all later than Bede) this clerk is called\r\n      St. Amphibalus, a name probably invented from his cloak\r\n      (_amphibalus_).\r\n\r\n   53 The text of this passage is probably corrupt, but all the MSS.\r\n      agree. I believe the above gives the intended meaning.\r\n\r\n   54 There is again probably some confusion in the text.\r\n\r\n   55 Now St. Albans in Hertfordshire, on the Watling Street, hence\r\n      probably the name, Vaeclingacaestir.\r\n\r\n   56 The place was afterwards called Holmhurst. The church mentioned by\r\n      Bede was superseded by the monastery of St. Alban, the foundation of\r\n      which is attributed to Offa, _circ._ 793 A.D. Certain extraordinary\r\n      privileges were granted to it, and its abbot obtained a superiority\r\n      over all other English abbots (Dugdale, “Monasticon”).\r\n\r\n   57 The evidence for their martyrdom is very doubtful.\r\n\r\n   58 Caerleon-on-Usk, the headquarters of the Second legion, is here\r\n      meant (_v._ Merivale, H.R., vi, 248), though the name was also\r\n      applied to Chester, seat of the Twentieth legion (cf. II, 2, p. 87,\r\n      “civitas legionum”).\r\n\r\n   59 Constantine the Great.

All the evidence goes to show\r\n      that this heresy affected Britain much less than Bede, on the\r\n      authority of Gildas, here implies.\r\n\r\n   61 Valens died 378.\r\n\r\n   62 Another of the insular usurpers (cf. c. 6). He had served under the\r\n      elder Theodosius in Britain. He revolted from Rome, successfully\r\n      repressed incursions of Picts and Scots, then crossed to Gaul, where\r\n      he maintained himself for four years, but was killed by the Emperor,\r\n      the younger Theodosius, at Aquileia, in 388.\r\n\r\n   63 The real date is 395.\r\n\r\n   64 Pelagius, the founder of the heresy known as Pelagianism, was\r\n      probably born in 370 A.D., and is said to have been a Briton, but\r\n      the tradition that his real name was Morgan (Marigena, Graecised\r\n      Πελάγιος), and that he was a native of Bangor, rests on very\r\n      doubtful authority. His great opponent, St. Augustine, speaks of him\r\n      as a good and holy man; later slanders are to be attributed to\r\n      Jerome’s abusive language. The cardinal point in his doctrine is his\r\n      denial of original sin, involving a too great reliance on the human\r\n      will in achieving holiness, and a limitation of the action of the\r\n      grace of God.\r\n\r\n   65 Julianus of Campania is regarded as the founder of semi-Pelagianism,\r\n      _i.e._, an intermediate position between the orthodox view and the\r\n      heresy of Pelagius. He was Bishop of Eclanum, near Beneventum, and\r\n      was along with seventeen other Italian bishops deposed in 418 A.D.\r\n      for refusing to sign the circular letter of Pope Zosimus condemning\r\n      the heresy.\r\n\r\n   66 A native of Aquitaine, born probably about 403 A.D., a strong\r\n      opponent of the Pelagians. It is uncertain whether he was in Holy\r\n      Orders or not. He wrote in prose and verse; his longest poem is\r\n      called “De Ingratis” (_i.e._, opponents of the grace of God). His\r\n      best known work is a Chronicle, not to be confused with the shorter\r\n      chronicle of Prosper Tiro.\r\n\r\n   67 Bede includes elegiacs under this term, cf. V, 8.\r\n\r\n   68 The date of Honorius is correct, but the invasion of Alaric is put a\r\n      year too late, if Bede refers to the first siege of Rome, in 408.\r\n\r\n   69 The British army, alarmed by the inroads of barbarians, and actuated\r\n      by a spirit of revolt against Roman authority, set up three local\r\n      emperors in rapid succession: Marcus, Gratian, and Constantine. The\r\n      first two they summarily deposed and killed, but Constantine by a\r\n      great victory made himself master of Gaul and Britain and extorted\r\n      from the Emperor Honorius a share in the Imperial authority.\r\n      Meanwhile, the Britons expelled the few remaining Roman officials,\r\n      and Honorius avenged himself on Constantine for the loss of Britain\r\n      in the manner described in the text.\r\n\r\n   70 A Roman general, afterwards associated with Honorius in the empire\r\n      for a few months.\r\n\r\n   71 Gerontius (Welsh _Geraint_, akin to Irish _Gerat_ or _Gerait_, a\r\n      champion), was a Briton, one of Constantine’s generals. Turning\r\n      against his master, he invited the Germans to invade Gaul and\r\n      Britain, probably intending to secure Britain for himself. But his\r\n      own men conspired against him and he died by his own hand.\r\n\r\n   72 Rome was taken 1163 A.U.C.; 410 A.D.\r\n\r\n   73 Possibly “light-houses.”\r\n\r\n   74 Probably Inchkeith in the Forth. The Irish called the Firth of Forth\r\n      the “Sea of Giudan” (_v._ Reeves’ “Culdees,” p. 124). But Professor\r\n      Rhŷs is inclined to think that Bede has confused the island Giudi\r\n      with Urbs Giudi, which may perhaps be identified with the Urbs Iudeu\r\n      of Nennius, probably either Carriden or Edinburgh (Rhŷs, “Celtic\r\n      Britain”).\r\n\r\n   75 Alcluith is the Welsh name (Ail = a rock). The Goidels called it\r\n      Dúnbrettan = the fortress of the Britons. Hence its modern name,\r\n      Dumbarton. The river is, of course, the Clyde.\r\n\r\n   76 This is the earthen rampart, about thirty-five miles in length,\r\n      between the Clyde and the Forth, now attributed to Antoninus Pius.\r\n      Little is known about it, and it is probable that it was soon\r\n      abandoned.\r\n\r\n   77 Abercorn, a village on the south bank of the Firth of Forth.\r\n\r\n   78 The name is probably Celtic (Goidelic), though, if the view which\r\n      regards the Picts as a non-Celtic people be correct, it may show\r\n      traces of Pictish influence. It seems to be connected with the Latin\r\n      term “penna valli” = wing of (_i.e._, pinnacle or turret at end of)\r\n      the _vallum_. Readers of Scott’s “Antiquary” will remember the\r\n      celebrated dispute with regard to this word. The Anglian _Penneltun_\r\n      is derived from the Goidelic name.\r\n\r\n   79 This probably refers to the wall now attributed to Hadrian (_v.s._\r\n      c. 5 note). It ran for a distance of about eighty-five miles from\r\n      Bowness-on-Solway to Wallsend-on-Tyne. Bede’s authorities are\r\n      Orosius and Gildas. The accounts he gives here and in c. 5 are an\r\n      attempt to explain the difficulties and conflicting evidence with\r\n      regard to these walls.\r\n\r\n   80 In 431 A.D. There is much confusion with regard to the mission of\r\n      Palladius. According to later accounts, he was an unsuccessful\r\n      forerunner of St. Patrick, but Bede here, following Prosper of\r\n      Aquitaine, represents the Irish (Scotti) as in part already\r\n      Christian. The origin of Irish Christianity is very obscure, and\r\n      some have even doubted the existence of St. Patrick. Bede only\r\n      mentions him once, viz., in the “Martyrology,” which has been\r\n      largely interpolated, and is, perhaps, not his genuine work. St.\r\n      Patrick’s latest biographer, Professor Bury, has, however, clearly\r\n      established a certain amount of fact underlying much legendary\r\n      matter. Some later authorities represent Palladius as preaching to\r\n      the Scots (in the modern sense) and Patrick to the Irish.\r\n\r\n   81 The great Roman general who preserved the Western Empire against the\r\n      invasions of the barbarians for many years. He was assassinated by\r\n      Valentinian in 454 A.D.\r\n\r\n   82 Really two years before, 444 A.D.\r\n\r\n   83 Though he is the subject of many legends, Vortigern is doubtless a\r\n      historical figure, a ruler of south-eastern Britain. Bede’s form of\r\n      the name, Uurtigernus, is right. It is a British word, meaning\r\n      “supreme lord” (Rhŷs).\r\n\r\n   84 The date of Marcian’s succession is 450.\r\n\r\n   85 Bede only professes to give the date of the invasion approximately:\r\n      cf. V, 24 (“quorum tempore”), I, 23; II, 14; V, 23 (“circiter”),\r\n      calculating in round numbers apparently. He refers here to their\r\n      first settlement, which, of course, does not preclude earlier\r\n      attacks.\r\n\r\n_   86 I.e._, Vortigern.\r\n\r\n_   87 Anglia_ was believed to be derived from _Angulus_. The country is\r\n      the modern Schleswig, which the Angles appear to have almost\r\n      entirely evacuated. For the Continental Saxons, cf. V, 9. It has\r\n      been supposed that the Jutes came from Jutland, where, at a later\r\n      period, they mingled with the Danes (_ibid._), but this is now\r\n      regarded as doubtful.\r\n\r\n   88 At Aylesford, in Kent. Horsted is the traditional burial-place of\r\n      Horsa.\r\n\r\n_   89 I.e._, in Thanet.\r\n\r\n   90 The most probable view is that he was the last of those Romans who\r\n      usurped imperial authority in Britain (_v.s._ cc. 6, 9).\r\n\r\n   91 The identification of this place with Badbury, in Dorsetshire\r\n      (Guest, followed by Freeman and Green) seems to be disproved (W. H.\r\n      Stevenson, in the “English Historical Review,” xvii, pp. 633, 634).\r\n      The locality is quite uncertain; Skene actually places it near\r\n      Linlithgow. According to Bede’s reckoning the date of the battle\r\n      would be 493 approximately. The “Annales Cambriae” give 516. For a\r\n      full discussion of the question, _v._ Plummer, _ad loc._ Cf. also\r\n      Mr. Stevenson’s article.\r\n\r\n   92 Nothing more is known of them. Pelagius left Britain in early life\r\n      and did not himself spread his heresy there.\r\n\r\n   93 The life of Germanus was written by Constantius, a priest of Lyons,\r\n      who is Bede’s authority for cc. 17-21. According to him, these\r\n      bishops were sent to Britain by a Gallican Synod. Prosper of\r\n      Aquitaine attributes the origin of the mission to Pope Celestine,\r\n      “acting on the advice of the deacon Palladius” (probably the\r\n      missionary to the Irish mentioned c. 13). The two statements are not\r\n      irreconcilable (cf. Bright, p. 18). There are churches dedicated to\r\n      SS. Germanus and Lupus in Wales and Cornwall. Both had been trained\r\n      in the school of Lérins, a monastery in the group of islands off the\r\n      coast at Cannes.\r\n\r\n   94 This conference is said to have been held at Verulam.\r\n\r\n   95 Bede’s authority, Constantius, shows here the first trace of any\r\n      acquaintance of early historians with the story of St. Alban. The\r\n      last sentence is somewhat obscure. Probably the idea is that the\r\n      blood of the martyrs continues to cry aloud for vengeance.\r\n\r\n   96 Reading “reserato.” The reading “reservato” is perhaps easier and\r\n      has some MS. authority.\r\n\r\n   97 Reading “castitatis,” from which it is difficult to extract any\r\n      meaning. The above strains the Latin unduly. Constantius has\r\n      “castrorum,” which gives a better sense.\r\n\r\n   98 Maes-y-Garmon (“The Field of Germanus”), near Mold, in Flintshire,\r\n      has been fixed upon as the scene of the Hallelujah Victory, and the\r\n      river in which the army was baptized is said to be the Alyn (Ussher,\r\n      “Antiqq.”). The story is generally regarded as legendary.\r\n\r\n   99 Thirteenth bishop of Trèves. This account sums up nearly all that is\r\n      known of him.\r\n\r\n  100 This second voyage of St. Germanus is supposed to have taken place\r\n      about eighteen years after the first, _i.e._, in 447.\r\n\r\n  101 The Armoricans had revolted, and Aetius (_v.s._ c. 13 and note) had\r\n      enlisted the services of the Alani against them. Germanus, who had\r\n      at one time been duke of the Armoricans, went to the Imperial Court\r\n      at Ravenna to intercede for them.\r\n\r\n  102 Really the fifth (16th March, 455 A.D.). Romulus Augustulus is\r\n      usually regarded as the last emperor of the west. He was overthrown\r\n      in 476 A.D.\r\n\r\n  103 The British historian, author of the “De Excidio Liber Querulus,” so\r\n      called from the historian’s denunciations of the sins of the\r\n      Britons. He himself tells us that he was born in the year of the\r\n      battle of Badon Hill (Mons Badonicus), and that he wrote his History\r\n      forty-four years after that date. According to Bede (cf. c. 15, _ad\r\n      init._, and c. 16, _ad fin._) this would place his birth\r\n      approximately in the year 493, but see note on c. 16.\r\n\r\n  104 Gregory the Great. Cf. Preface. Bede places the date of his\r\n      accession a year too late as well as that of his death (_v._, II, 1,\r\n      _ad init._, but in the same chapter he rightly places his death in\r\n      the second year of Phocas, _i.e._, 604).\r\n\r\n  105 Augustine was prior of St. Gregory’s Monastery dedicated to St.\r\n      Andrew in Rome.\r\n\r\n  106 Cf. IV, 5, p. 227, note.\r\n\r\n  107 This is a mistake. Aetherius was archbishop of Lyons. Vergilius was\r\n      archbishop of Arles. The letter given here, however, is the letter\r\n      sent to Aetherius. Similar letters were despatched to other bishops\r\n      at this time; among them one to Vergilius of Arles.\r\n\r\n  108 A presbyter sent into Gaul by Gregory in 595 A.D. to administer the\r\n      little patrimony of St. Peter in Gaul, to collect its revenues and\r\n      to invest them in raiment for the poor, or in English slave lads to\r\n      serve in the monasteries and receive a Christian education.\r\n\r\n  109 Ethelbert was the third Bretwalda or dominant king. He had\r\n      established a practical hegemony over the East Anglians, the\r\n      Mercians of the Trent Valley, the South Saxons, East Saxons, and\r\n      even the West Saxons (cf. II, 5, p. 94).\r\n\r\n  110 Families, _i.e._, _hides_. The hide, probably, was as much land as\r\n      would support a family, hence the extent must have varied with the\r\n      different conditions in different parts of the country.\r\n\r\n  111 In Bede’s time Thanet was divided from the rest of Kent by a broad\r\n      channel called the Wantsum, now partly represented by the River\r\n      Stour.\r\n\r\n  112 The conjecture that they landed at Ebbsfleet, which is also\r\n      traditionally regarded as the landing-place of Hengist, has been\r\n      generally adopted. Other possible landing-places are Stonar and\r\n      Richborough. For a full discussion of the question, _v._ “The\r\n      Mission of St. Augustine,” ed. Rev. A. T. Mason, D.D.\r\n\r\n  113 It has been supposed, on the strength of this passage, that the\r\n      speech of the Franks and the English was still mutually\r\n      intelligible. This is supported by a statement of Gregory (letter to\r\n      Theoderic and Theodebert) that he had desired Augustine to take some\r\n      Frankish priests with him. It is assumed that these priests were the\r\n      interpreters. On the other hand, in view of the fact that only fifty\r\n      years later we find the language of the Franks regarded in England\r\n      as a “barbara loquella” (III, 7), it has been inferred that the\r\n      interpreters were men who had acquired a knowledge of the dialect of\r\n      Kent through commerce or otherwise.\r\n\r\n  114 Daughter of Charibert, king of Paris.\r\n\r\n  115 Said (on doubtful authority) to have been bishop of Senlis. He acted\r\n      as the queen’s private chaplain. There is nothing to show that\r\n      either he or Bertha attempted to spread their religion in England,\r\n      though probably their influence may not have been without effect on\r\n      Ethelbert.\r\n\r\n  116 The old Roman town of Doruvernis, which is the name Bede gives to it\r\n      throughout the History.\r\n\r\n  117 St. Martin was regarded with special reverence in Britain and\r\n      Ireland. Possibly some of the earliest missionaries may have been\r\n      his disciples, _e.g._, St. Ninian and St. Patrick. The Roman church\r\n      of St. Martin at Canterbury has been frequently altered and partly\r\n      rebuilt, so that “small portions only of the Roman walls remain.\r\n      Roman bricks are used as old materials in the parts rebuilt”\r\n      (Parker).\r\n\r\n  118 Augustine was not consecrated as archbishop either of London or\r\n      Canterbury, but by the general title of “Archbishop of the English.”\r\n      According to Gregory’s original scheme, London, not Canterbury, was\r\n      to have been the seat of the primacy of southern England (cf. c.\r\n      29), London and York being doubtless the most important cities of\r\n      south and north known to him from their history during the Roman\r\n      occupation. But Christianity was not permanently established in\r\n      London till it was too late to remove the see from Canterbury, which\r\n      would obviously commend itself to Augustine as the most suitable\r\n      place to be the metropolitan city.\r\n\r\n  119 For Aetherius read Vergilius (_v._ c. 24, note). “The occupant of\r\n      the see of Arles was in some sense primate of France at this time,\r\n      and, as such, Vergilius received the _pallium_ and the papal\r\n      vice-gerentship in the kingdom of Childebert” (Dict. Christ. Biog.).\r\n\r\n  120 He succeeded Augustine as archbishop. For his history, _v._ II, 6,\r\n      7.\r\n\r\n  121 Cf. _infra_ c. 33.\r\n\r\n_  122 I.e._, those in minor orders; all below the subdiaconate.\r\n\r\n  123 St. Luke, xi, 41. _Quod superest_ (Vulgate) = πλήν (R.V.,“Howbeit”;\r\n      A.V., “But rather”), adverbial. Gregory takes it to mean “what is\r\n      over.”\r\n\r\n  124 Augustine must have observed these differences of ritual as he\r\n      travelled through Gaul. Presumably also he found the Gallic use\r\n      adopted at St. Martin’s, Canterbury, by Liudhard. Dr. Bright\r\n      summarizes these differences, “Early English Church History,” p. 64.\r\n\r\n  125 Reading “fratris et sororis” (for “frater et soror”), as the sense\r\n      requires, but there is no MS. authority for the change.\r\n\r\n  126 The text of this passage is corrupt, but no very satisfactory\r\n      emendations have been suggested.\r\n\r\n  127 The _Pallium_ is a long strip of fine cloth ornamented with crosses.\r\n      It is made from wool of lambs reared in the convent of St. Agnes at\r\n      Rome, and is laid for a night on the tomb of St. Peter. It is worn\r\n      passing over the shoulders, with the ends hanging down in front and\r\n      behind, somewhat in the form of the letter Y. (The form has varied\r\n      at different times.) In the east it is called “omophorion:” the\r\n      bishops wear it during the celebration of the Eucharist. It\r\n      originally formed part of the imperial habit and was granted by the\r\n      emperor as a special mark of honour. Afterwards the pope claimed the\r\n      exclusive right of bestowing it, and its possession became\r\n      restricted to metropolitans, and was considered necessary for the\r\n      exercise of their functions.\r\n\r\n  128 Deut., xxiii, 25.\r\n\r\n  129 The reference may be to the third General Council held at Ephesus in\r\n      431 A.D., at which the rule was laid down “that no bishop may act in\r\n      any province which has not always been subject to him.”\r\n\r\n  130 This is Bede’s attempt to reconcile the discrepancy created by his\r\n      mistake in cc. 24 and 27.\r\n\r\n  131 Mellitus was consecrated Bishop of London in 604, and succeeded\r\n      Laurentius in the see of Canterbury in 619.

Of these, the “Liber Sacramentorum” (_v. infra_), the “Liber\r\n      Antiphonarius” (a collection of Antiphons for Mass), and the Hymns\r\n      have been generally regarded as genuine, but recent research seems\r\n      to show that they cannot be attributed to Gregory.

He was opposed by Gregory, and the book was burnt by\r\n      order of the Emperor Tiberius, who, however, visited him when he\r\n      fell ill soon after, and received his blessing. He died on Easter\r\n      Day, 582, and the “heresy” was suffered to rest.

It\r\n      seems probable, however, that it is of much later date. Only a few\r\n      alterations in the Liturgy and in the ceremonial of the Mass are\r\n      proved to have been effected by Gregory. In the Canon of the Mass he\r\n      introduced two changes, viz.: (1) he inserted the words here quoted;\r\n      (2) he altered the position of the Lord’s Prayer (_v._ Homes Dudden,\r\n      pp. 264-271).\r\n\r\n_  158 I.e._, 604 A.D., cf. I, 23; II, 1, _ad init._, note.\r\n\r\n  159 Deira was the southern part of the province of Northumbria, the\r\n      northern part being Bernicia. Deira was bounded on the south by the\r\n      Humber; on the north, according to some authorities, by the Tyne,\r\n      according to others, by the Tees. The discrepancy doubtless arose\r\n      from the fact that the part between the two latter rivers was a\r\n      desert subject to no authority. To the west lay the British\r\n      kingdoms.\r\n\r\n  160 The son of Yffi, the first king of Deira. The ancient pedigrees\r\n      trace the descent of the royal houses of Deira and Bernicia from two\r\n      sons of Woden.\r\n\r\n  161 This pope was either Benedict I (574-578) or Pelagius II (578-590),\r\n      the immediate predecessor of Gregory. The oldest extant life of\r\n      Gregory (_v.s._ p. 75, note) makes him Benedict, and is followed by\r\n      John the Deacon. If this is right, the incident related in the text\r\n      must be placed before Gregory’s departure to Constantinople in 579.\r\n      Paul the Deacon places it after his return in 585 or 586, and\r\n      asserts that the pope was Pelagius II.\r\n\r\n  162 The date of the synod is uncertain. It was probably about 602 or 603\r\n      A.D., after the arrival of Gregory’s “Responsa.” The “nearest\r\n      province” must mean what we call South Wales, though it is possible\r\n      that the Britons of Cornwall were also represented. The scene of the\r\n      conference has been generally supposed to be Aust, on the Severn,\r\n      opposite Chepstow, and the name may possibly preserve the memory of\r\n      Augustine, though more probably it is derived from “Trajectus\r\n      Augusti” (Haddan and Stubbs). Other possible sites are Malmesbury\r\n      (Green, “Making of England”), and a spot called “the Oak,” near\r\n      Cricklade, on the Upper Thames, which would be on the borders of the\r\n      Hwiccas and West Saxons (_v._ Plummer, _ad loc._).\r\n\r\n  163 The Hwiccas were in the present Gloucestershire and Worcestershire,\r\n      north-west of Wessex.\r\n\r\n  164 Cf. especially III, 25, and V, 21. (Other references are: II, 4, 19;\r\n      III, 3, 4, 26, 29; V, 15, 22.)\r\n\r\n      A full discussion of this involved question is beyond our scope.\r\n      Readers are referred to Plummer (Excursus on Paschal Controversy),\r\n      Bright, or Hunt. Here, the point at issue may be briefly stated. It\r\n      was regarded as essential by the Roman Church that Easter Day should\r\n      be kept on a Sunday, in the third week of the first month, _i.e._,\r\n      the month in which the full moon occurred on or after the vernal\r\n      equinox. The Celts observed the Feast on Sunday, and were,\r\n      therefore, not rightly called “Quartodecimans” (the name given to\r\n      those who observed it on the 14th of the month Nisan, the day of the\r\n      Jewish Passover, without regard to the day of the week). They\r\n      differed from the Romans in fixing the vernal equinox at March 25th,\r\n      instead of March 21st, and in their reckoning of the third week,\r\n      holding it to be from the 14th to the 20th of the moon inclusive.\r\n      The Roman Church originally reckoned it from the 16th to the 22nd,\r\n      but ultimately fixed it from the 15th to the 21st (cf. V, 21, p.\r\n      365).\r\n\r\n      There was a further divergence in the “cycles” adopted to ascertain\r\n      the day in each year on which the Paschal moon would fall. The Celts\r\n      retained an old cycle of eighty-four years, while the Romans had\r\n      finally adopted one of nineteen. It is obvious that these\r\n      differences must necessarily lead to great divergence in practice\r\n      and consequently serious inconvenience. The real importance of this\r\n      and the other points of difference, settled afterwards at the Synod\r\n      of Whitby, lay in the question whether England was to conform to the\r\n      practice of the Catholic Church, or to isolate herself from it by\r\n      local peculiarities (cf. the reply of the British to Augustine:\r\n      “They would do none of those things nor receive him as their\r\n      archbishop”).\r\n\r\n_  165 E.g._, Consecration of bishops by a single bishop, certain\r\n      differences of ritual (Gregory’s “Responsa” admit of some latitude\r\n      in these matters), and the tonsure, which was a more controversial\r\n      point (cf. III, 26, and V, 21). The Romans shaved only the top of\r\n      the head, letting the hair grow in the form of a crown. The Celts\r\n      shaved the whole front of the head from ear to ear, leaving the hair\r\n      at the back. A third method was the Oriental, which consisted in\r\n      shaving the whole head (cf. IV, 1).\r\n\r\n  166 The place of the second conference is not mentioned. It is generally\r\n      assumed that it was the same as that of the first. All attempts to\r\n      determine the names and sees of these bishops rest upon the most\r\n      uncertain evidence.\r\n\r\n  167 Probably Bangor-is-Coed, in Flintshire, from which it appears that\r\n      North Wales was represented at the second conference. The size and\r\n      importance of the monastery are inferred by William of Malmesbury,\r\n      writing in the twelfth century, from the extent of the ruins, which\r\n      were all that was left of it in his time.\r\n\r\n  168 Dunawd, or Dunod; Latin: Donatus (Rhŷs).\r\n\r\n  169 It is not known in what way the practice of the British Church\r\n      differed from that of the Romans in the rite of Baptism. It may have\r\n      been by the neglect of Confirmation as the completion of Baptism\r\n      (cf. “compleatis” in the text). Other suggestions are: single\r\n      immersion (but this was permitted in Spain); the omission of chrism,\r\n      an omission which was affirmed of the Irish at a later period; some\r\n      defect in the invocation of the Trinity. This conjecture rests on a\r\n      canon respecting Baptism established in the English Church from the\r\n      time of Augustine (quoted by Haddan and Stubbs from a letter of Pope\r\n      Zacharias to Boniface), which enforces the full invocation.\r\n\r\n  170 I, 34.\r\n\r\n  171 Chester, the seat of the Twentieth legion. “Legionum civitas, quae\r\n      nunc simpliciter Cestra vocatur.” (William of Malmesbury.)

Bede only tells us that it was a considerable time after\r\n      Augustine’s death, which was probably in 604 or 605.\r\n\r\n  172 Cf. _supra_ p. 86, note 2.\r\n\r\n  173 Nothing certain is known of this Welsh prince.\r\n\r\n  174 I, 29, and note.\r\n\r\n  175 The site is covered by the present cathedral.\r\n\r\n  176 Rochester.

I, 23).\r\n      According to Rochester tradition, Ethelbert gave to the church some\r\n      land called Priestfield to the south of the city, and other lands to\r\n      the north. There exists a charter of Ethelbert to the city of\r\n      Rochester, believed to be genuine.\r\n\r\n  178 The year is not given, and is not certainly known. It is generally\r\n      assumed to have been 604 or 605.\r\n\r\n  179 This was in 613, by Laurentius. St. Augustine’s body was translated\r\n      on September 13th. It was moved again in the twelfth century and\r\n      placed under the high altar.\r\n\r\n  180 “Porticus”; variously translated: “porch,” “aisle,” “transept,” and\r\n      “chapel.” Ducange explains it as “aedis sacrae propylaeum in\r\n      porticus formam exstructum,” and says it was also used improperly\r\n      for the sanctuary. Plummer (_ad loc._) says it means side chapel, as\r\n      often. The mention of the altar just below seems to support this\r\n      meaning (if, indeed, _haec_ refers to the “porticus,” and not to the\r\n      church itself, as is assumed in the A.S. version).\r\n\r\n  181 For Theodore _v._ Preface, p. 2, note 2; IV, 1; V, 8, _et saep._;\r\n      and for Bertwald, V, 8.

He was a vigorous\r\n      supporter of the Celtic usages and an active opponent of Arianism.\r\n      He instituted a monastic rule of great severity.\r\n\r\n  187 Nothing more is known of this council. The pope was Boniface IV,\r\n      608-615.\r\n\r\n  188 610 A.D.\r\n\r\n  189 To commemorate the dedication the pope introduced into the Western\r\n      Church the Festival of All Saints, celebrated at first probably on\r\n      13th May. The Eastern Church had from early times observed a\r\n      Festival of All Martyrs, which became later the Festival of All\r\n      Saints, kept by them on the Sunday after Whitsunday.\r\n\r\n  190 As Bretwalda, or paramount sovereign (_v._ Stubbs, “Constitutional\r\n      History,” I, pp. 162-163).

Boniface V died in October, 625.\r\n      Paulinus had only been consecrated in the preceding July, so it is\r\n      impossible that Boniface could have heard of Edwin’s delay in\r\n      receiving the faith; _v._ following letter (c. 11).

The object of the rule was to avoid the day of the Jewish\r\n      Passover.\r\n\r\n  266 Cf. I, 10, note.\r\n\r\n  267 These bishops have been identified as follows: Tomianus is Tomene,\r\n      Abbot and Bishop of Armagh; Columbanus is Colman, Abbot of Clonard\r\n      (also a bishop); Cromanus is Cronan, Bishop of Nendrum, or\r\n      Inishmahee; Dinnaus is probably Dima, Bishop of Connor; Baithanus\r\n      has not been identified with any certainty. With regard to the\r\n      priests the proposed identifications are more conjectural. Saranus\r\n      is a certain Saran Ua Critain. Two vice-gerents of the Papal see are\r\n      associated with the Pope elect in writing this letter. The\r\n      arch-presbyter and the “primicerius notariorum,” with the\r\n      archdeacon, acted as vice-gerents during a vacancy, or in the\r\n      absence of the Pope (cf. Plummer _ad loc._).\r\n\r\n  268 This is not fairly stated. The Irish were not “Quartodecimans,”\r\n      _i.e._, did not insist on the celebration of Easter being on the\r\n      fourteenth of the moon. They only included that day as a possible\r\n      one for Easter (cf. _supra_ c. 2, p. 84, note 3).\r\n\r\n  269 Ps. li, 5, in our Psalter.

The\r\n      theory that Gregory the Great was the founder of Gregorian music,\r\n      which superseded the old “Cantus Ambrosianus” everywhere in the West\r\n      except at Milan, must in all probability be abandoned. It seems to\r\n      be established that no change of any importance was made till nearly\r\n      a hundred years after Gregory’s time, and “the terms ‘Gregorianus,’\r\n      ‘Ambrosianus Cantus,’ probably mean nothing more than the style of\r\n      singing according to the respective uses of Rome and Milan.” (F.\r\n      Homes Dudden, “Gregory the Great,” I, p. 274.)\r\n\r\n  282 Cf.

II, 20, _ad init._\r\n\r\n  286 “In oppido municipio.” Commentators are agreed that Bede means York.\r\n      It was a Roman “Colonia,” and is called a “municipium” by Aurelius\r\n      Victor, though whether Bede attaches any definitely Roman meaning to\r\n      the term seems doubtful. Ducange explains “municipium” as “castrum,”\r\n      “castellum muris cinctum.”\r\n\r\n  287 From the death of Edwin (October 12th, 633), for Oswald’s reign is\r\n      reckoned as lasting nine years, including the “hateful year,” and he\r\n      was killed August 5th, 642. Cf. _infra_ c. 9.\r\n\r\n_  288 I.e._, probably before the end of 634.\r\n\r\n  289 Not identified with any certainty, but probably the Rowley Water or\r\n      a tributary of it. It cannot be, as has been suggested, the Devil’s\r\n      Water, which is clearly distinguished from it in a charter of the\r\n      thirteenth century. Caedwalla must have fled southwards for eight or\r\n      nine miles after the battle (cf. next note).\r\n\r\n  290 For another instance of a name with an inner meaning, cf. II, 15.\r\n      The site of the battle is probably seven or eight miles north of\r\n      Hexham (v. next note), Oswald having taken up his position on the\r\n      northern side of the Roman wall between the Tyne and the Solway\r\n      (_i.e._, the wall attributed to Hadrian, cf. I, 12, p. 25, note).\r\n      According to tradition the battle was finally won at a place called\r\n      Halydene (Hallington?), two miles to the east.\r\n\r\n  291 Hexham. Wilfrid built a magnificent church there between the years\r\n      672-678 on land given by Ethelthryth, wife of Egfrid, king of\r\n      Northumbria. It became the see of a bishop in 678 when the great\r\n      northern diocese was subdivided by Theodore (_v._ IV, 12). Bede’s\r\n      own monastery of Wearmouth and Jarrow was in the diocese of Hexham.\r\n      The bishopric became extinct in 821.\r\n\r\n  292 The place is still called St. Oswald’s, and a little chapel probably\r\n      marks the spot.\r\n\r\n_  293 I.e._, Irish.\r\n\r\n  294 Cf. II, 2, note on Paschal Controversy.\r\n\r\n  295 Bishop of Laodicea, _circ._ 284 A.D. According to Eusebius, he was\r\n      the first to arrange the cycle of nineteen years. The Canon quoted\r\n      by the Celts in support of their observance of Easter is proved to\r\n      be a forgery, probably of the seventh century and of British origin.\r\n\r\n  296 Probably they adopted Catholic customs about 633, after the return\r\n      of their delegates sent to consult the Roman Church on this question\r\n      in 631.\r\n\r\n  297 Cf. Preface, p. 4, note 3. The Celtic missionaries were generally\r\n      attracted to remote sites, and this, the first mission station of\r\n      the Celtic Church in Northumbria, was doubtless chosen for the\r\n      resemblance of its physical features to Iona. The constitution was\r\n      also modelled on that of Iona, with this difference, that it was an\r\n      episcopal see as well as a monastery. It was included in the\r\n      “province” of the Abbot of Iona. The Bishop and all the clergy were\r\n      monks, and Aidan himself was Abbot as well as Bishop.\r\n\r\n  298 “Sacerdotali,” perhaps (but not necessarily here) = “episcopal,” as\r\n      often. There may have been a number of the Irish non-diocesan\r\n      bishops in the mission.\r\n\r\n  299 Iona, a name supposed to have arisen from a mistaken reading of\r\n      _Ioua_, an adjectival form used by Adamnan (_v. infra_ note 4),\r\n      feminine, agreeing with _insula_, formed from the Irish name, I, Ii,\r\n      Hii, etc. (the forms vary greatly). Then “Iona” was fancifully\r\n      regarded as the Hebrew equivalent for _Columba_ (= a dove), and this\r\n      helped to preserve the name.\r\n\r\n_  300 I.e._, Irish.\r\n\r\n  301 For St. Columba, _v._ Dr. Reeves’s edition of the life by Adamnan,\r\n      Abbot of Iona, 679-704 (cf. V, 15, note). Authorities are divided\r\n      with regard to the date of his coming to Britain. Dr. Reeves and Mr.\r\n      Skene, following the Annals of Tighernach, decide in favour of 563.\r\n      For his name, “Columcille,” cf. V, 9, note. He was of Irish birth,\r\n      connected with the Dalriadic Scots, and of royal descent on both\r\n      sides of his house. He was ordained priest at Clonard, but was never\r\n      a bishop. Many ecclesiastical and monastic foundations throughout\r\n      Ireland and Scotland are attributed to him. He travelled much in\r\n      both countries, visited Bruide (_v. infra_) at Inverness, and\r\n      founded churches all over the north of Scotland. He also worked\r\n      indefatigably in his own monastery of Iona. In his earlier years his\r\n      excitable, impatient temperament seems to have involved him in\r\n      various wars. He is said to have stirred up his kinsmen against the\r\n      Irish king, Diarmaid; and it has been supposed that his mission to\r\n      the Picts was undertaken in expiation of the bloodshed for which he\r\n      was responsible.\r\n\r\n  302 There is much that is legendary in the account of St. Ninias, and\r\n      Bede only professes to give the tradition. He was a Briton, probably\r\n      a native of Strathclyde. He studied at Rome and received episcopal\r\n      consecration there; came under the influence of St. Martin of Tours,\r\n      to whom he afterwards dedicated his church in Galloway, and returned\r\n      as a missionary to Britain. His preaching led to the conversion of\r\n      the Picts of Galloway and those to whom Bede alludes here as\r\n      situated to the south of the Grampians. Irish tradition, difficult\r\n      to reconcile with Bede’s statement that he was buried at Whitern,\r\n      tells that he spent the last years of his life in Ireland and\r\n      founded a church at Leinster. He was commemorated there on September\r\n      16th, under the name of Moinenn. The traditional date of his death,\r\n      September 16th, 432, has no authority.\r\n\r\n  303 Whitern, on Wigton Bay, so called from the white appearance of the\r\n      stone church, as compared with the usual wooden buildings. The\r\n      dedication must have been subsequent to St. Martin’s death, _circ._\r\n      397. The see was revived as an Anglian one in Bede’s own time (_v._\r\n      V. 23, p. 381). For the form of the name, “Ad Candidam Casam,” cf.\r\n      II, 14, p. 119, note 5.\r\n\r\n  304 Bruide Mac Maelchon had defeated the Dalriadic Scots in 560 A.D. and\r\n      driven them back to Cantyre. Northwards his dominion extended as far\r\n      as the Orkneys and it is probable that it included the eastern\r\n      lowlands north of the Forth (cf. Rhŷs, “Celtic Britain”). Another\r\n      tradition (Irish) represents Conall, King of the Dalriadic Scots, as\r\n      the donor of Iona, but the earliest Irish authority (ninth or tenth\r\n      century) agrees with Bede.\r\n\r\n  305 The year in which he died, as well as the ultimate resting-place of\r\n      his relics, is uncertain. Dr. Reeves places his death in 597, the\r\n      year of St. Augustine’s landing.\r\n\r\n_  306 I.e._, in Irish. The place is Durrow in Leinster.\r\n\r\n  307 There was no diocesan episcopate in the early Irish Church; it was\r\n      organized on a monastic system. Bishops performed all episcopal\r\n      functions (ordination, etc.), but they lived in the monastery,\r\n      subject to the supreme authority of the abbot, who was aided in the\r\n      government by a council of senior monks. Bishops were also sent out\r\n      as missionaries. The functions of abbot and bishop might be combined\r\n      in one man, but the abbot, as such, could discharge no episcopal\r\n      duties. A great monastery was head of a “provincia” (“diocesis,”\r\n      “parochia”), and had many monasteries and churches dependent on it.\r\n\r\n  308 Cf. c. 27, IV, 3, 26; V, 9, 10, 22, 23, 24. Perhaps “sacerdos”\r\n      should be translated “bishop” here (_v. supra_ c. 3, note; _infra_\r\n      c. 27, note). Early writers allude to him as a bishop, _e.g._,\r\n      Alcuin, Ethelwulf. In the life of St. Adalbert, one of Wilbrord’s\r\n      companions (cf. V. 10), he is called “Northumbrorum episcopus.”\r\n\r\n_  309 I.e._, they were not “Quartodecimans” (cf. II, 2, p. 84, note 3).\r\n\r\n  310 Phil., iii, 15.\r\n\r\n  311 Cf. II, 19. He is probably to be identified with the Segenus\r\n      mentioned there as one of the priests to whom Pope John’s letter was\r\n      addressed. He was Abbot of Iona, 623-652.\r\n\r\n  312 Hector Boethius gives his name as Corman.\r\n\r\n  313 Cf. I, 1, p. 6, note 2.\r\n\r\n  314 Bamborough (Bebbanburh, Bebburgh, Babbanburch, etc. There are many\r\n      forms of the name). It is uncertain who the queen was. Nennius says\r\n      she was the wife of Ethelfrid. His wife, Oswald’s mother, was Acha\r\n      (_v. infra_), but he may have been married twice. It was Ida, the\r\n      first king of Bernicia, who founded Bamborough (Sax. Chron.).\r\n\r\n  315 Cf. II, 5 _ad fin._, note.\r\n\r\n  316 Cf. note on Cuichelm, II, 9. Cynegils began to reign in 611 and\r\n      reigned about thirty-one years.\r\n\r\n  317 This account tells us substantially all that is known of him.\r\n      Additional details are either legendary or conjectural. He was made\r\n      a missionary (“regionary”) bishop, _i.e._, had no fixed see assigned\r\n      to him.\r\n\r\n  318 II, 17, 18, 19, 20.\r\n\r\n  319 He was Archbishop of Milan, residing at Genoa. “Asterius ... like\r\n      his predecessors from 568, avoided contact with the dominant Arian\r\n      Lombards by residing within the imperial territory at Genoa”\r\n      (Bright).\r\n\r\n  320 Called Cyneburga by Reginald of Durham (Life of St. Oswald).\r\n\r\n  321 Dorchester, about nine miles from Oxford, near the junction of the\r\n      Thame and the Thames. The Abbey Church of SS. Peter and Paul stands\r\n      on the traditional site of Cynegil’s baptism. The see became extinct\r\n      on the retirement of Agilbert (_v. infra_), but there are some\r\n      grounds for believing that it was revived for a short time as a\r\n      Mercian see in 679 (_v._ p. 272, note), after which it again\r\n      disappeared till, in the ninth century, the Bishop of Leicester\r\n      moved his see to Dorchester.\r\n\r\n  322 IV, 12; V, 18. Haedde became bishop in 676 (Sax. Chron.). His see\r\n      was at Winchester. He removed the bones of Birinus, because\r\n      Dorchester had ceased to be an episcopal see. Winchester continued\r\n      to be the only West Saxon see till the diocese was again divided\r\n      (_v._ V, 18), when Daniel was established at Winchester, and Aldhelm\r\n      at Sherborne.\r\n\r\n  323 Winchester; _Gwent_ (Celtic) = a plain. This, the “old Church,” as\r\n      distinguished from the present Cathedral, was built by Coinwalch on\r\n      his restoration to his kingdom. There are legends of early British\r\n      churches on the site, the first founded by “King Lucius” (I, 4), the\r\n      second dedicated to “St. Amphibalus” (I, 7, p. 15, note).\r\n\r\n  324 Cuichelm (_v._ II, 9, and note) had died before his father,\r\n      Cynegils.\r\n\r\n  325 Bede reverts more than once to the subject of Anna’s pious\r\n      offspring, _v. infra_ cc. 8, 18; IV, 19, 20. He had four daughters:\r\n      Sexburg (c. 8, IV, 19, 22), Ethelberg (c. 8), Ethelthryth (IV, 19,\r\n      20; cf. IV, 3, 22), and Witberg (not mentioned by Bede); two\r\n      granddaughters, Earcongota (c. 8) and Ermingild, the wife of\r\n      Wulfhere of Mercia; all of whom entered convents, as did also his\r\n      step-daughter, Saethryth (c. 8).\r\n\r\n  326 Cc. 25, 26, 28; IV, 1; V, 19. The name is a Frankish form of the\r\n      English “Aethelbert.” He was apparently consecrated in Gaul, but not\r\n      appointed to any diocese.\r\n\r\n  327 Cf. c. 28. It is not known why he was expelled (_v. infra_). There\r\n      is a tradition that he spent the last three years of his life at\r\n      Winchester as a penitent, doubtless for the act of simony related\r\n      below, but this is inconsistent with Bede’s statement that he\r\n      remained Bishop of London till his death.\r\n\r\n  328 Winchester; _v.s._ pp. 148-9, notes.\r\n\r\n  329 London was an East Saxon bishopric, but Wulfhere (_v._ c. 24, _ad\r\n      fin._) had acquired the supremacy over the East Saxons (_v._ c. 30).\r\n\r\n  330 Hlothere, consecrated 670. Apparently he was appointed by a West\r\n      Saxon Synod (“ex synodica sanctione”). Dr. Bright thinks the term is\r\n      used loosely for a Witenagemot.\r\n\r\n  331 II, 5-9, 20; V, 24.\r\n\r\n  332 Faremoûtier-en-Brie (Farae Monasterium in Brige), founded _circ._\r\n      617 by Fara, or Burgundofara, a Burgundian lady of noble birth, said\r\n      to have been dedicated by St. Columba in her infancy. The monastery\r\n      was a double one, _i.e._, consisted of monks and nuns (cf. _infra_,\r\n      “many of the brethren”).\r\n\r\n  333 Chelles, near Paris, founded by Clothilde, wife of Clovis I,\r\n      restored and enlarged by Bathild, wife of Clovis II (_v._ V, 19,\r\n      note).\r\n\r\n  334 Andeley-sur-Seine, also founded by Clothilde, wife of Clovis I.\r\n\r\n  335 Cf. _supra_ c. 7, note on Anna.\r\n\r\n_  336 Ibid._\r\n\r\n_  337 Ibid._\r\n\r\n_  338 Ibid._\r\n\r\n  339 Cf. c. 1.\r\n\r\n  340 The place is commonly supposed to be near Oswestry in Shropshire\r\n      (_i.e._, Oswald’s Tree). There is a legend (related by Reginald)\r\n      which tells of a tree near the spot, to which a large bird carried\r\n      the king’s right arm from the stake (cf. c. 12 _ad fin._). The Welsh\r\n      name of the place, “Croes Oswallt” (Cross-Oswald), points to the\r\n      explanation that the “tree” was a wooden cross set up to mark the\r\n      site.\r\n\r\n  341 642, _i.e._, nine years after the death of Edwin.\r\n\r\n  342 Reading _stramine subtracto_, on the authority of the oldest MSS.,\r\n      in which case we must assume (with Plummer) that _stramen_ is used\r\n      incorrectly for _stragulus_ in the sense of “saddle,” or\r\n      “horse-cloth,” from the classical use, _sternere equum_ = to saddle.\r\n      Cf. “stratus regaliter,” c. 14. Later MSS. read _stramine substrato_\r\n      (= “spreading straw under him”).\r\n\r\n  343 Wife of Ethelred of Mercia (cf.

This is the only mention of its\r\n      abbot, Aldwin.\r\n\r\n  348 Aen. II, 1. Quotations from Vergil are frequent in Bede. Cf.

Hence St. Cuthbert\r\n      is often represented holding St. Oswald’s head in his hands.\r\n\r\n  351 Bamborough: cf. c. 6, note.\r\n\r\n  352 Bishop of Hexham, 709-731: _v._ V, 20 (cf. also IV, 14; V, 19). He\r\n      was a much loved friend of Bede, many of whose works were undertaken\r\n      at his instigation. He was devotedly attached to Wilfrid, whom he\r\n      succeeded at Hexham. The “Continuation” says that he was expelled\r\n      from his see in 731, and he probably never regained it.\r\n\r\n  353 Cf. V. 19, p. 353. This was probably Wilfrid’s third journey to\r\n      Rome, undertaken in 703-704, for, at the time of his earlier journey\r\n      (in 678), when he spent the winter in Frisland, Wilbrord was not yet\r\n      there.\r\n\r\n  354 The great missionary archbishop of the Frisians.

Oswald united the two Northumbrian kingdoms,\r\n      but at his death, Oswin, son of Osric, succeeded to Deira. He was\r\n      canonised, and his tragic death led him to be regarded as a martyr.\r\n\r\n  361 Not identified.

It is obvious from the sequel that\r\n      this vision was prior to his journey to Britain, and is distinct\r\n      from the vision mentioned above.\r\n\r\n  384 Ps. lxxxiv, 7; (lxxxiii, 8, in the Vulgate). The reading is that of\r\n      the Vulgate and the Gallican Psalter: “Ibunt de virtute in virtutem:\r\n      videbitur Deus deorum in Sion.”\r\n\r\n_  385 Ibid._\r\n\r\n_  386 I.e._, Ireland.\r\n\r\n  387 The monastery at Burgh Castle.\r\n\r\n  388 Fullan, or Foillan, was apparently a bishop (the others are called\r\n      “presbyteri”). He and Ultan after Fursa’s death (_circ._ 650) went\r\n      to South Brabant. Ultan founded a monastery at Fosse in the diocese\r\n      of Liège (then of Maestricht), and Fullan laboured in conjunction\r\n      with St. Gertrude in the double monastery of Nivelles. Ultan became\r\n      abbot, first of Fosse and later of Péronne. The name Gobban occurs\r\n      frequently in Irish Church History, Dicull occasionally. There is a\r\n      Dicull mentioned in IV, 13.\r\n\r\n_  389 I.e._, the Mercians; _v.s._ c. 18.\r\n\r\n  390 Clovis II, King of Neustria, 638-656.

The rapid increase in the number of native bishops may\r\n      be seen from this chapter. The only one before Thomas was Ithamar\r\n      (cf. c. 14, p. 164).\r\n\r\n  394 The Fen country. The province included part of the counties of\r\n      Lincoln, Northampton, Huntingdon, and Cambridge.\r\n\r\n  395 Such changes of name were frequent: cf.

He died in 664 (_v._ IV, 1).\r\n      His original name is said to have been Frithonas; Deusdedit is the\r\n      Latin form of Theodore. There was a Pope of the same name, 615-618\r\n      (_v._ II, 7). Similar names were common in the African Church,\r\n      _e.g._, “Adeodatus,” “Habetdeus,” “Quodvultdeus,” “Deogratias.”\r\n\r\n  398 Cf. c. 14, and note.\r\n\r\n  399 Cf. IV, 2. It has been supposed that he died of the plague of 664.\r\n      After his death the see was vacant for several years. It is\r\n      remarkable that he came of a race which had not yet become\r\n      Christian. The South Saxons continued to be pagan till Wilfrid\r\n      evangelized them, 681-686 (IV, 13).\r\n\r\n  400 For their origin, _v._ I, 15.

Below, Bede says that Oswy\r\n      concluded the war in the district of “Loidis,” by which he must mean\r\n      Leeds, as in II, 14, and most commentators adopt this view. In this\r\n      case, the river may be the Aire, or more probably the Went, a\r\n      tributary of the Don. Others believe the district to be the\r\n      Lothians, following the account in Nennius, who describes Oswy as\r\n      taking refuge before the battle in a city called Iudeu, supposed to\r\n      be either Edinburgh or Carriden (cf. I, 12, note), and the river has\r\n      been supposed to be the Avon in Linlithgow.\r\n\r\n  438 She is mentioned as joint-abbess with her mother, Eanfled, of the\r\n      monastery of Whitby (IV, 26). Eddius calls her “sapientissima\r\n      virgo,” “semper totius provinciae consolatrix optimaque\r\n      consiliatrix.” Her influence helped to restore Wilfrid to the\r\n      bishopric. She was the friend of St. Cuthbert, who is said to have\r\n      wrought a miraculous cure on her behalf.

Doubtless\r\n      he desired to have the canonical number of three bishops at his\r\n      consecration, and Boniface of Dunwich (c. 20; IV, 5) was the only\r\n      prelate in England whose orders he would have regarded as entirely\r\n      satisfactory, for Wini might be considered a usurper, and Cedd and\r\n      Jaruman had been consecrated by schismatics. Archbishop Deusdedit\r\n      was dead (III, 20, note) and so probably was Damian of Rochester.\r\n\r\n  493 He was Wilfrid’s friend: _v.s._ c. 25, pp. 194-5.\r\n\r\n  494 Cf. _ibid._, note.\r\n\r\n  495 Compiègne, a royal “villa.” For the preposition, _v._ II, 14, note.\r\n      The ceremony was a specially magnificent one, Wilfrid being carried\r\n      in a golden chair by twelve bishops in choral procession, according\r\n      to an ancient custom of the Gallican Church.\r\n\r\n  496 Preface, III, 23, _et saep._ Why Oswy, who had consented to\r\n      Wilfrid’s consecration (_v._ V, 19) acted in this manner is not\r\n      clear. Probably it implies that the Celtic party, during Wilfrid’s\r\n      prolonged absence, had to some extent recovered their ascendency;\r\n      and, if it was at this time that Alchfrid (who is not heard of\r\n      again) rebelled against his father (_v.s._ c. 14, _ad init._) and\r\n      was deprived of his kingdom, Wilfrid would have lost his warmest\r\n      supporter.\r\n\r\n  497 He retired to Ripon from Lindsey, of which he was the first separate\r\n      bishop, when Ethelred recovered that province for Mercia in 679. But\r\n      cf.

Ceadda’s\r\n      consecration was afterwards regarded as of doubtful validity and was\r\n      completed by Theodore (_v._ IV, 12). The British (probably Cornish)\r\n      bishops were schismatical, and Wini’s position was irregular.\r\n      Moreover, the see to which Ceadda was consecrated was not vacant.\r\n\r\n  500 IV, 1.\r\n\r\n  501 Consecrated in 657—died in 672.\r\n\r\n  502 Isaiah, xi, 10.\r\n\r\n_  503 Ibid._, xlix, 1.\r\n\r\n_  504 Ibid._, 6.\r\n\r\n_  505 Ibid._, 7.\r\n\r\n_  506 Ibid._, 8-9.\r\n\r\n_  507 Ibid._, xlii, 6-7. The readings are from the Vulgate.\r\n\r\n  508 It has not been stated that Oswy and Egbert asked the Pope to\r\n      provide an archbishop, failing Wighard. But this seems to be implied\r\n      in IV, 1: “episcopum, quem petierant.” Or, as is generally supposed,\r\n      Vitalian may have arbitrarily assumed this to be the intention of\r\n      their letter.\r\n\r\n  509 There were several martyrs of the name of Laurentius, but the best\r\n      known is the Roman deacon, St. Laurence, who suffered at Rome in 258\r\n      A.D. He was buried in the Via Tiburtina, where a church dedicated to\r\n      him is said to have been founded by Constantine the Great. On the\r\n      site stands the present Church of S. Lorenzo fuori le Mura, the\r\n      older part of which dates from the sixth century at least. One of\r\n      Aldhelm’s foundations (V, 18) was a little church dedicated to St.\r\n      Laurence at Bradford-on-Avon in 705, probably the small Saxon church\r\n      which still stands there. There were many martyrs named John and\r\n      Paul, and more than one Gregory. St. Pancras was a boy-martyr, a\r\n      Phrygian by birth, who suffered at Rome in 304 A.D., when he was\r\n      only fourteen years of age. His martyrdom was widely celebrated, and\r\n      miraculous powers were attributed to his tomb outside the walls of\r\n      Rome. An old British church at Canterbury, which had been desecrated\r\n      by the heathen invaders, was restored for Christian use and\r\n      dedicated to St. Pancras by Augustine.\r\n\r\n  510 Eanfled, _v.s._ c. 15 and note.\r\n\r\n  511 St. Matt., vi, 33.\r\n\r\n  512 Cf.

He mentions himself (“Life of\r\n      Wilfrid,” Chapter XIV) as a “cantor.”\r\n\r\n  538 Bede can scarcely mean to impeach the orthodoxy of the bishops of\r\n      native birth prior to Wilfrid. Probably the reference is mainly to\r\n      the prominent part he took in bringing about the decision at Whitby.\r\n\r\n  539 Cf. III, 28, note.\r\n\r\n  540 Cf.

Florence of Worcester mentions a Putta, Bishop of\r\n      Hereford, who died in 688, but it is very doubtful whether he can be\r\n      identified with the above. Bede’s words in Chapter 12 do not imply\r\n      that Putta, Bishop of Rochester, became Bishop of Hereford. Hereford\r\n      was not one of the five sees into which Florence tells us that\r\n      Theodore divided the great Mercian bishopric, but it appears soon\r\n      after as a separate see for Hecana (Herefordshire). Possibly Putta,\r\n      who is traditionally reckoned as its first bishop, may have acted as\r\n      Sexwulf’s deputy there.\r\n\r\n  542 Cf. II, 20 _ad fin._, note.\r\n\r\n  543 III, 24, 30. He had probably died two years before Chad’s\r\n      appointment, _i.e._, in 667, and the see had been vacant in the\r\n      interval, for Wilfrid, then in retirement at Ripon, is said (by\r\n      Eddius) to have discharged episcopal functions for the Mercians.\r\n\r\n  544 Lastingham. Cf. Preface, p. 3; III, 23, 28.\r\n\r\n  545 Lindsey at this time belonged to Mercia. Cf. c. 12, p. 243, note 5.\r\n\r\n  546 Smith believed this place to be Barton-on-Humber. It is now\r\n      generally identified with Barrow in Lincolnshire. For the\r\n      preposition, cf. II, 14, p. 119, note 5.\r\n\r\n  547 It had not previously been an episcopal see, though Wulfhere had\r\n      wished to establish Wilfrid there during the vacancy in the Mercian\r\n      bishopric (p. 218, note 4). When the bishopric of Mercia and Lindsey\r\n      was subdivided by Theodore in 679, Lichfield remained the see of the\r\n      bishopric of Mercia proper. In 787, under Offa, King of Mercia, with\r\n      the consent of Pope Hadrian, it was raised into a separate\r\n      archbishopric for Mercia and East Anglia, but in 802 Canterbury was\r\n      re-established as the sole archbishopric for the Southern Province.\r\n      The popular derivation of the name, Lichfield (“Field of the Dead”)\r\n      is from _lic_ = a corpse, and the place is traditionally connected\r\n      with the martyrdom of a great number of British Christians. Another\r\n      derivation, however (from _leccian_ = to irrigate), points to the\r\n      meaning “the watered field.”\r\n\r\n  548 Eccl., iii. 5.\r\n\r\n  549 A stone which is believed to have formed part of Owini’s tomb was\r\n      found at the end of the eighteenth century at Haddenham, near Ely,\r\n      and is now in Ely Cathedral.

It\r\n      became an episcopal see, which in 1559 was annexed to the\r\n      archbishopric of Tuam.\r\n\r\n  560 Hertford.\r\n\r\n  561 It seems probable that we ought to read 671; cf. Plummer _ad loc._\r\n\r\n  562 Oswy is the last king in Bede’s list of those who held an “imperium”\r\n      (_v._ II, 5). With the rise of Mercia under Wulfhere (III, 24), the\r\n      supremacy of Northumbria had virtually passed away. After Oswy’s\r\n      death, the position of Northumbria was an isolated one, and it was\r\n      by conquests over Britons, not Englishmen, that Egfrid enlarged the\r\n      bounds of his kingdom.\r\n\r\n  563 In his youth he had been a hostage at the court of Queen Cynwise,\r\n      wife of Penda (III, 24, p. 188).\r\n\r\n  564 This is of supreme importance as the first English provincial\r\n      Council and the first national assembly of the English. The rule\r\n      laid down at Nicaea and confirmed by later councils was that\r\n      provincial synods should meet twice a year to settle all\r\n      ecclesiastical matters which affected the province as a unity.\r\n\r\n  565 24th September, 673, falls in the first indiction, whether the\r\n      Pontifical or the “Caesarean” system is meant (_v._ Haddan and\r\n      Stubbs, III, 121). Bede himself used the Caesarean indiction, of\r\n      which we get the first notice in his “De Temporum Ratione.” It began\r\n      on 24th September. It does not, however, follow that Theodore also\r\n      used it. The oldest scheme, viz., the Constantinopolitan, began on\r\n      1st September; the Roman or Pontifical, on New Year’s Day as\r\n      received at the time, _i.e._, 25th December, 1st January, or 21st\r\n      March. For Indictions, _v._ “Dictionary of Christian Antiquities.”\r\n      They were cycles of fifteen years, a mode of reckoning dates which\r\n      appeared in the fourth century, based upon the Imperial fiscal\r\n      system, but which came to be used irrespective of taxation. “1st\r\n      indiction” stands for “1st year of the indiction.”\r\n\r\n  566 Of the six suffragans only four were present. Wilfrid was at this\r\n      time (669-678) in possession of his see; why he did not appear in\r\n      person is not explained. Possibly his action foreshadows the future\r\n      troubles between him and Theodore. Wini, Bishop of London, was still\r\n      alive (_v._ III, 7, and note). If the story of his retirement to\r\n      Winchester is true, this would account for his absence. For Bisi,\r\n      _v. infra_. His see was at Dunwich (cf. II, 15). For Putta, _v.s._\r\n      c. 2 and note; for Leutherius, _v._ III, 7; for Wynfrid, III, 24;\r\n      IV, 3, _ad fin._\r\n\r\n  567 The collection of Canons approved by the Council of Chalcedon,\r\n      translated into Latin by Dionysius Exiguus (early in the sixth\r\n      century, cf. V, 21, p. 369, note) and adopted by the Western Church.\r\n\r\n  568 This place used to be identified with Cliff-at-Hoe near Rochester,\r\n      but the theory rests mainly on the similarity of name. As in the\r\n      recorded Councils of Clovesho the supremacy of Mercia is clearly\r\n      indicated, it is generally assumed that the place must have been\r\n      either in Mercia or a kingdom subject to it, as Kent was at the\r\n      time. Except one Council in 716, we find none mentioned as having\r\n      taken place at Clovesho till seventy years after this time (747),\r\n      but councils were held at other places.\r\n\r\n  569 The subdivision of the great bishoprics was an important part of\r\n      Theodore’s policy, and though at this Council he failed to carry his\r\n      point, possibly through the opposition of Wilfrid’s representatives,\r\n      in the succeeding years he effected a great change in the\r\n      organization of the episcopate, creating dioceses co-extensive with\r\n      tribal territories.\r\n\r\n  570 III, 29; IV, 1.\r\n\r\n  571 Cc. 22, 26.\r\n\r\n  572 His original name was Bertgils, _v._ III, 20.\r\n\r\n  573 Theodore availed himself of this opportunity for subdivision. Aecci\r\n      was appointed to Dunwich and Badwin to the new see of Elmham.\r\n      Suffolk and Norfolk thus each received a separate bishopric. The\r\n      Danish invasions broke up this arrangement; Dunwich disappeared as\r\n      an episcopal see, and the succession to Elmham was interrupted for a\r\n      time. In 1075 the see of the single East Anglian bishopric was\r\n      removed to Thetford, and in 1094 to Norwich.\r\n\r\n  574 It has been conjectured that he resisted the subdivision of his\r\n      diocese. For his subsequent adventures, _v._ III, 24, p. 192, note\r\n      4.\r\n\r\n  575 This was probably in 675 (Flor. of Wor.). Sexwulf (_v. infra_ c. 12)\r\n      had been a rich thegn who became a monk and was made first abbot of\r\n      Medeshamstead.\r\n\r\n  576 Peterborough, as the town which grew up around the monastery came to\r\n      be called in the tenth century, the monastery being dedicated to St.\r\n      Peter. Peada is said to have planned the foundation (_v._\r\n      Peterborough additions to the Saxon Chronicle), but the accounts are\r\n      late and untrustworthy.\r\n\r\n  577 III, 20, note.\r\n\r\n  578 C. 3, p. 219, note 2.\r\n\r\n  579 He succeeded Wini (III, 7) in 675 and died about 693. He was\r\n      canonized. It was in his house that the reconciliation between\r\n      Theodore and Wilfrid took place. It is said that as a boy he had\r\n      heard Mellitus preach in London. He was present at the West Saxon\r\n      Witenagemot which enacted the “Dooms of Ine” (c. 15 and V, 7), and\r\n      is spoken of as one of Ine’s bishops, Essex being probably subject\r\n      to Wessex at that time.\r\n\r\n  580 In III, 30.\r\n\r\n  581 Cc. 7-10. She is not to be confused with Ethelberg, daughter of Anna\r\n      (III, 8), Abbess of Faremoûtier-en-Brie.\r\n\r\n  582 Chertsey in Surrey. William of Malmesbury tells us that it was a\r\n      flourishing monastery till it was destroyed by the Danes.\r\n\r\n  583 Barking in Essex, _v. infra_ cc. 7-10. For the preposition, _v._ II,\r\n      14, p. 119, note 5.\r\n\r\n  584 The plague of 664 has been mentioned in III, 27; IV, 1, 3; but this\r\n      may have been a later visitation. Barking is generally supposed to\r\n      have been founded in 666.\r\n\r\n  585 Two different dates are given for her succession, 664 and 675. If\r\n      the former is right, the plague (c. 7) must have been that of 664,\r\n      and Ethelburg probably died of it. It appears from a letter of St.\r\n      Boniface that Hildilid was alive in 709. She was one of Aldhelm’s\r\n      numerous women-scholars. He dedicated the prose version of his work\r\n      in praise of virginity (_v._ V, 18) to her and others of the\r\n      sisterhood, and speaks highly of their scholarly attainments.\r\n\r\n  586 Apparently a life of St. Ethelburg not known to exist now.\r\n\r\n  587 Cf. III, 30; IV, 6.\r\n\r\n  588 For Earconwald, _v.s._ c. 6. Waldhere is the first of a long list of\r\n      undistinguished bishops of London given by William of Malmesbury. A\r\n      letter of his to Archbishop Bertwald survives, and there is a\r\n      charter in which Swefred (_v._ next note) grants lands at Twickenham\r\n      to him in 704.\r\n\r\n  589 Cf. V, 8, note on Suaebhard.\r\n\r\n  590 St. Paul’s, London. Sebbi’s tomb is believed to have survived till\r\n      the fire of 1666.\r\n\r\n  591 For these bishops, cf. III, 7.\r\n\r\n_  592 Ibid._ He died in 672 (Sax. Chron.). Of the sub-kings the most\r\n      prominent were Aescwine and Centwine, a brother of Coinwalch. The\r\n      Saxon Chronicle gives a different account. According to it,\r\n      Coinwalch’s widow, Sexburg, reigned for one year after him and was\r\n      succeeded by Aescwine, who was succeeded by Centwine.\r\n\r\n  593 Cf. III, 7, and for his character, V, 18. The Saxon Chronicle says\r\n      he succeeded in 676 and died in 703. Bede places his death in 705\r\n      (V, 18).\r\n\r\n  594 Cc. 15, 16, and V, 7. He was of Ceaulin’s line (II, 5) and so\r\n      belonged to a younger branch of the West Saxon royal house. Welsh\r\n      writers confuse him with the British king, Caedwalla (II, 20), and\r\n      with his son, Cadwalader.\r\n\r\n  595 A son of Penda. He succeeded his brother Wulfhere in 675. In 704 he\r\n      became a monk (V, 24) and afterwards Abbot of Bardney Monastery (cf.\r\n      III, 11), which he is said to have founded. His invasion of Kent was\r\n      probably provoked by an attempt on the part of that kingdom, at\r\n      Wulfhere’s death, to resume a position of independence towards\r\n      Mercia. In spite of his conduct on this raid, Theodore, Florence of\r\n      Worcester, and others, speak of the saintliness of his character.\r\n\r\n  596 Cc. 2 (and note), 5.\r\n\r\n  597 C. 6, and note, and _infra_, p. 244.\r\n\r\n  598 The dates of these changes in the episcopate are uncertain. Probably\r\n      Gebmund was consecrated in 678. For his death, _v._ V, 8 _ad fin._,\r\n      and note.\r\n\r\n  599 This was Wilfrid’s first expulsion (_v._ V, 19). Bede’s reticence on\r\n      the subject is noteworthy. Egfrid’s hostility to his former friend,\r\n      Wilfrid, was doubtless caused by Wilfrid’s encouragement of Queen\r\n      Ethelthryth (cc. 19, 20) in her desire to take the veil. It was\r\n      probably increased by Egfrid’s second wife, Eormenburg, who is said\r\n      to have resented Wilfrid’s power and magnificence. Theodore,\r\n      carrying out his policy of subdivision, availed himself of the\r\n      opportunity afforded by this dissension. He consulted some of his\r\n      suffragans (we do not know who they were; it was apparently at a\r\n      mixed council of ecclesiastics and laymen), but did not communicate\r\n      with Wilfrid, being, no doubt, conscious of the uselessness of\r\n      trying to get his consent. Wilfrid, after demanding an explanation\r\n      from the archbishop and the king in a Northumbrian “gemot,” and\r\n      receiving no satisfaction, appealed to Rome (cf. V, 19, p. 351). For\r\n      the importance of this step, _v._ Bright, “Early English Church\r\n      History,” pp. 323-326.\r\n\r\n  600 Probably the intention was that Wilfrid should keep the larger part\r\n      of Deira, with his see at York, and that three new dioceses should\r\n      be formed. But, on his departure to appeal to Rome, it was assumed\r\n      that he had resigned his bishopric, and Bosa was consecrated Bishop\r\n      of Deira with his see at York, Eata, Bishop of the Bernicians, with\r\n      the option of fixing his see either at Lindisfarne or Hagustald\r\n      (Hexham). These two were “substituted for him.” Lindsey, which at\r\n      this time belonged to Northumbria, became for the first time a\r\n      separate diocese. When it passed again to Mercia in 679 it was\r\n      included in the subdivision of the Mercian bishopric, and Ethelwin\r\n      (_v. infra_ note 6) became its bishop with his see at Sidnacaestir\r\n      (generally identified with Stow, but the locality is unknown).\r\n\r\n  601 He was one of the bishops educated in Hilda’s monastery (_v._ c.\r\n      23). Bede speaks highly of him (V, 3, 20), and Alcuin calls him “vir\r\n      sine fraude bonus.” He retired from York when Wilfrid was restored,\r\n      but appears to have been reinstated on Wilfrid’s second expulsion.\r\n\r\n  602 Abbot of Melrose, afterwards of Lindisfarne (III, 26, and note; IV,\r\n      27; V, 9).\r\n\r\n  603 III, 28, and this Chapter, _ad fin._, and note.\r\n\r\n  604 In 675. Lindsey which had been Northumbrian under Edwin and Oswald,\r\n      had passed through many vicissitudes. Penda conquered it, Oswy\r\n      recovered it (in 655), Wulfhere conquered it again, Egfrid recovered\r\n      it (675). It passed finally to Mercia under Ethelred in 679 (_v.\r\n      infra_ this Chapter, _ad fin._).\r\n\r\n  605 III, 11, 27.\r\n\r\n  606 He was still Bishop of Lindsey in 706, when he signed a charter of\r\n      Ethelward, “subregulus” of the Hwiccas.\r\n\r\n  607 Preface, p. 4, and V, 23. Simeon of Durham says that he died in 732.\r\n\r\n  608 Lindsey was at that time subject to Mercia. Sexwulf was expelled\r\n      when Egfrid conquered it in 675. When the Mercian diocese was\r\n      subdivided, he retained his see at Lichfield (_v.s._ c. 3, p. 219,\r\n      note) as Bishop of the Mercians proper.\r\n\r\n  609 By Theodore alone. The suffragans did not take part in the\r\n      consecration.\r\n\r\n  610 In 681 a fresh subdivision took place. The Bernician diocese was\r\n      divided, Eata retaining Lindisfarne and giving up Hexham to Tunbert.\r\n      Afterwards Eata retired from Lindisfarne in favour of Cuthbert and\r\n      took Hexham (_v. infra_ c. 28). Tunbert had been Abbot of Gilling\r\n      (In Getlingum, III, 14, 24). He was deposed by Theodore from Hexham\r\n      three years after his consecration (_v. infra_ c. 28), like Wynfrid,\r\n      “pro culpa cujusdam inobedientiae” (Vita Eatae in “Miscellanea\r\n      Biographica,” Surtees Society).\r\n\r\n  611 His see was not at Whitern among the Picts of Galloway, as has been\r\n      supposed (Florence of Worcester, Richard of Hexham, and others), but\r\n      at the monastery of Abercorn on the Forth (I, 12; IV, 26), the Picts\r\n      north of the Forth being at this time subject to Northumbria. After\r\n      Egfrid’s disastrous expedition in 685, they freed themselves from\r\n      Northumbrian rule, the see was abandoned, and Trumwine retired to\r\n      Whitby (c. 26). We hear of him as one of the deputation to Cuthbert\r\n      in 684 (c. 28).\r\n\r\n  612 In 679; _v.s._, p. 243, note 5.\r\n\r\n  613 Whether Ripon became for a time an episcopal see seems doubtful. In\r\n      III, 28, Bede says distinctly that Eadhaed became “praesul” of the\r\n      church there, and it does not seem consistent with his use to\r\n      understand it as = abbot. Probably there was an attempt to subdivide\r\n      the diocese of Deira (Eddius mentions it as one of Wilfrid’s\r\n      grievances), but the scheme was abandoned when Wilfrid was restored\r\n      in 705. Ripon did not finally become an episcopal see till 1836.\r\n\r\n  614 For a fuller account, _v._ V, 19, and notes.\r\n\r\n  615 For the early importance of this kingdom under Aelli, _v._ II, 5. It\r\n      had become a small insignificant nation, cut off from its neighbours\r\n      by forests (the “Andredsweald”) and marshes, and though we read\r\n      (III, 20) that Damian, bishop of Rochester, was of the South Saxon\r\n      race, it was almost untouched by Christian influences.\r\n\r\n  616 Cf. _infra_ c. 15.\r\n\r\n  617 He also brought about the reconversion of the East Saxons by sending\r\n      Bishop Jaruman to them. Cf. III, 30.\r\n\r\n  618 Wulfhere had invaded Wessex, probably in 661 (Sax. Chron.), and\r\n      conquered the Isle of Wight and the district of the Meanware,\r\n      _i.e._, the district from Southampton Water to the South Downs. The\r\n      inhabitants were Jutes. The name survives in the hundreds,\r\n      Meonstoke, and East and West Meon. For the termination “ware” =\r\n      dwellers, cf. Lindisfari, Cantuarii, Boructuari, etc.\r\n\r\n  619 Cf. c. 14.\r\n\r\n  620 Cf. II, 2, p. 84, note 2.\r\n\r\n  621 They were probably joint kings of the Hwiccas.\r\n\r\n  622 “Scottish,” as usual, means Irish. There is another Dicul mentioned\r\n      in III, 19. Stevenson suggests the identification of this Dicul with\r\n      the Irish monk who wrote a geographical work, the “De Mensura Orbis\r\n      Terrae,” but he lived in the ninth century.\r\n\r\n  623 Bosham, near Chichester.

It\r\n      was a royal “vill.” It became the episcopal see for the South Saxons\r\n      at some time about 709 (cf. V, 18, _ad fin._ and note), transferred\r\n      to Chichester in 1075.\r\n\r\n  625 Egfrid fell at the battle of Nechtansmere in 685 (_v._ c. 26), and\r\n      Wilfrid was restored to his bishopric “in the second year of\r\n      Aldfrid,” Egfrid’s successor (V, 19, p. 353). He was in Wessex with\r\n      Caedwalla for part of the year 686 (cf. c. 16).\r\n\r\n  626 III, 13, note.\r\n\r\n  627 C. 13.\r\n\r\n  628 This English equivalent for “viaticum” is used by Stapleton in his\r\n      translation (1565).\r\n\r\n  629 Calendars to show the proper days for commemorative Masses, cf.\r\n      _infra_ “chronicle” (“annale”).

He\r\n      was condemned by the synod of Constantinople in 448, and by the\r\n      council of Chalcedon in 451. He was the originator of the\r\n      Monophysite heresy which denied the existence of the two natures,\r\n      the Divine and human, in the Incarnate Son. Monothelitism, which was\r\n      the subject of the controversy alluded to here, arose out of an\r\n      attempt to reconcile the Monophysites by the assertion of one will\r\n      and operation (activity, ἐνέργεια) in our Lord. It was condemned in\r\n      the General Council of Constantinople, 680-681. In anticipation of\r\n      this council various provincial synods were held, as well as the\r\n      synod at Rome assembled by Pope Agatho, at which Wilfrid represented\r\n      the English church (_v._ V. 19).\r\n\r\n  645 The year was 680 (cf. V, 24), but it falls in the eighth year of\r\n      Hlothere of Kent, who succeeded in July, 673. For Egfrid, _v.s._ c.\r\n      5, _ad init._ Probably he succeeded in 671. Ethelred of Mercia\r\n      succeeded in 675 (V, 24), so that Sept., 680, might easily fall in\r\n      his sixth year; Aldwulf, of East Anglia, in 663 or 664 (_v._ II, 15;\r\n      IV, 23). The eighth indiction, whether Cæsarean or Pontifical\r\n      (_v.s._ c. 5, note), includes Sept. 17, 680.\r\n\r\n  646 Generally identified with Hatfield in Hertfordshire, but T. Kerslake\r\n      (“Vestiges of the supremacy of Mercia”) supposes it to be Clovesho\r\n      (Cliff-at-Hoe); _v.s._ c. 5, and note.\r\n\r\n  647 The five Oecumenical Councils which had been held before this time,\r\n      viz., Nicaea, in 325; Constantinople, in 381-382; Ephesus, in 431;\r\n      Chalcedon, in 451; Constantinople, in 553. For the Arian heresy,\r\n      _v._ I, 8 (and note), where “madness” (“vesania”) is, as here, the\r\n      word used to describe it. Macedonius was a “semi-Arian,” Eudoxius an\r\n      Arian; both were bishops of Constantinople. Nestorius was\r\n      consecrated Bishop of Constantinople in 428. He popularized the\r\n      heresy which originated with Theodore, Bishop of Mopsuestia,\r\n      392-428. It consisted in emphasizing the human element in our Lord’s\r\n      Nature to the practical exclusion of the Divine, as a reaction\r\n      against Apollinarianism which explained away His real Humanity. “The\r\n      Christ of Nestorius was, after all, simply a deified man, not God\r\n      incarnate” (Gore, “Bampton Lectures”). Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus in\r\n      Syria (died 457) and Ibas, Bishop of Edessa, 435-457, were disciples\r\n      of Theodore, Bishop of Mopsuestia, and opponents of Cyril of\r\n      Alexandria, who is accused of Apollinarianism in the letter of Ibas.\r\n\r\n  648 Justinian I, 527-565.\r\n\r\n  649 The first Lateran Council, in 649, against the Monothelites.

The “filioque”\r\n      clause, which formed no part of the Nicene Creed, nor of its\r\n      Constantinopolitan recension, had been formally adopted at the Third\r\n      Council of Toledo in 589 and at subsequent Spanish councils. The\r\n      English prelates at Hatfield were probably influenced by this\r\n      precedent.\r\n\r\n  652 Cf. Bede’s “History of the Abbots,” § 6.\r\n\r\n_  653 I.e._, St. Peter’s at Rome. The Monastery of St. Martin was on the\r\n      Esquiline. It was founded by Pope Symmachus in honour of SS.\r\n      Sylvester and Martin.\r\n\r\n  654 Cf. c. 1, notes. (For his life, v. Bede’s “History of the Abbots,”\r\n      and the Anon. “History of the Abbots.”) He has not been mentioned\r\n      before in this history. His ecclesiastical surname was Benedict,\r\n      “Baducing” was probably his patronymic. He was of noble birth and a\r\n      thegn of King Oswy, born in 628. He was the companion of Wilfrid on\r\n      his first journey to Rome (V, 19). In his native province of\r\n      Northumbria he founded the monasteries of Wearmouth (in 674) and\r\n      Jarrow (_circ._ 681), where Bede’s life was passed, and enriched\r\n      them with furniture, vestments, relics, pictures, and a library of\r\n      valuable books which he brought from the Continent. The rule which\r\n      he framed for his monasteries was Benedictine, compiled from\r\n      seventeen different monasteries which he had visited. He died Jan.\r\n      12, 689.\r\n\r\n  655 Cf. V, 21. Bede’s “History of the Abbots,” and Anon. “History of the\r\n      Abbots.” He added to Benedict’s library. He had been a monk at Ripon\r\n      under Wilfrid, became Abbot of Jarrow in 681, and of Wearmouth in\r\n      addition to Jarrow in 688. In 716 he resigned and set out for Rome,\r\n      but died at Langres in the same year. Bede was trained under him (V,\r\n      24) and was probably the little boy left alone with him to recite\r\n      the offices when the pestilence of 686 swept away the monks. (Anon.\r\n      Hist.

Bede tells us in the “Life of Cuthbert,” that she was a\r\n      half sister of Oswy’s on the mother’s side. Her name survives in\r\n      Ebchester on the Derwent, where she founded a nunnery; in St. Abb’s\r\n      Head, near which she afterwards founded the double monastery of\r\n      Coldingham; and in St. Ebbe’s, Oxford. She was the friend of\r\n      Cuthbert, and it was to her exhortations to Egfrid that Wilfrid owed\r\n      his release from prison.\r\n\r\n  663 Coldingham in Berwickshire. It was a mixed monastery. Cf. c. 25.\r\n\r\n  664 Ely. The Isle of Ely was her jointure from her first husband. She\r\n      received the help and support of Aldwulf, king of East Anglia (II,\r\n      15; IV, 17, 23), her cousin (he was the son of Ethelhere and nephew\r\n      of Anna). The monastery was founded in 673. It was exempted from the\r\n      jurisdiction of the East Anglian bishop, and subject to Wilfrid.\r\n\r\n  665 III, 8, cf. III, 7, note. After her husband’s death she acted as\r\n      regent for a time, then founded a monastery in the Isle of Sheppey,\r\n      and became abbess of it. Thence she retired to Ely, where, after\r\n      being a simple nun, she succeeded Ethelthryth as abbess. She was\r\n      herself succeeded first at Sheppey, and afterwards at Ely, by her\r\n      daughter Ermingild, widow of Wulfhere of Mercia.\r\n\r\n  666 Grantchester, near Cambridge.\r\n\r\n  667 A Roman sarcophagus. A number of fragments of very ancient stone\r\n      coffins have been found there, built into the wall of the church\r\n      (Mayor and Lumby).\r\n\r\n  668 “Audrey” is the popular form of the name Ethelthryth. A “tawdry\r\n      lace” (_i.e._ St. Audrey lace) is a necklace; cf. “Winter’s Tale,”\r\n      iv. 3. Hence our word “tawdry,” which possibly only derives its\r\n      meaning from the cheap necklaces, etc., sold at St. Audrey’s fair at\r\n      Ely on the saint’s day, October 17 (the day of her translation), but\r\n      may also be a reminiscence of this anecdote.\r\n\r\n  669 The poem is (1) alphabetical; _i.e._, the first letters of the\r\n      hexameter lines form the alphabet, and there are four additional\r\n      couplets at the end, in which the first letters form the word\r\n      “Amen”; (2) “serpentine,” reciprocal or echoing; _i.e._, the last\r\n      half of the pentameter repeats the first two and a half feet of the\r\n      hexameter. Such verses are common in mediaeval Latin, and are\r\n      doubtless a development from the occasional instances of echoing\r\n      lines which occur in the classical poets (_e.g._, Martial VIII, xxi,\r\n      1-2; IX, 97; Ovid, Fasti IV, 365-366), as the extreme form of that\r\n      impulse to give emphasis by iteration which is a marked feature of\r\n      Latin poetry, particularly of the Ovidian elegiac.\r\n\r\n  670 Agatha suffered 5th February, 251 A.D., in the Decian persecution,\r\n      according to her “Acta” (the Diocletian, according to the\r\n      Martyrology and Aldhelm). Eulalia was burnt to death at the age of\r\n      twelve in the Diocletian persecution, having denounced herself. The\r\n      legend tells that a white dove hovered over her ashes till snow fell\r\n      and covered them. Tecla, the disciple of St. Paul, is said to have\r\n      been the first virgin martyr. She was miraculously saved from her\r\n      martyrdom and died in peace long after. Euphemia was torn by wild\r\n      beasts at Chalcedon in 307 A.D. in the Diocletian persecution.\r\n      Asterius, Bishop of Amasea, 400 A.D., says that he saw a tablet in\r\n      the church at Chalcedon depicting her sufferings. We have thus very\r\n      early evidence for her history. Agnes is said to have been beheaded\r\n      in 304 A.D., in the Diocletian persecution, at the age of twelve or\r\n      thirteen. The date of St. Cecilia is very uncertain; Fortunatus,\r\n      Bishop of Poitiers, says that she died _circ._ 176-180 A.D., but\r\n      another account places her martyrdom as late as the time of\r\n      Diocletian. Her connection with music does not appear in the\r\n      legends, and is probably due to the fact that Pope Paschal endowed\r\n      the monastery which he built in connection with her church at Rome\r\n      to provide for musical services at her tomb day and night.\r\n\r\n  671 She had not been a queen twelve years. The dates are probably these:\r\n      she was born about 630 at Ermynge (Ixning) in Suffolk, and married\r\n      to Tondbert in 652. Tondbert died in 655, and she was married to\r\n      Egfrid (who must then have been only fifteen) in 660. Egfrid\r\n      succeeded to the throne in 670 or 671, and it must have been in 672\r\n      that she retired to Coldingham. She was, therefore, queen for not\r\n      more than two years, though perhaps we may accept the statement of\r\n      the Liber Eliensis that Egfrid was sub-king of Deira for some years\r\n      before his accession.\r\n\r\n_  672 I.e._, she had been buried sixteen years; _v.s._ c. 19.\r\n\r\n  673 Literally the water snake, ὕδρος, used generally for any serpent,\r\n      and so = the Devil; _Chelydrus_ is similarly used (_v._ Ducange).\r\n\r\n  674 The Battle of the Trent in 679 (cf. V, 24). It was on the\r\n      anniversary of Wilfrid’s expulsion; he is said to have foretold a\r\n      calamity. The place may, perhaps, be identified with\r\n      Elford-on-Trent, in Staffordshire; it is supposed that the name may\r\n      be a reminiscence of Aelfwine. By this battle Mercia regained\r\n      Lindsey, which never again became Northumbrian (cf. c. 12, _ad\r\n      fin._).\r\n\r\n  675 Cf. c. 22, where he is called “King Aelfwine,” as also twice in\r\n      Eddius. He may have been sub-king of Deira.\r\n\r\n  676 III, 11; V, 24. When Wilfrid took refuge in Mercia in 681, she and\r\n      her husband expelled him “pro adulatione Egfridi regis” (Eddius).\r\n\r\n  677 The “Wergild,” _i.e._, pecuniary value set upon every man’s life\r\n      according to his status (_v._ Stubbs, “Constitutional History”).\r\n\r\n  678 “Comes,” A.S. “gesith.” Above, Imma is described as “de militia ejus\r\n      juvenis,” _i.e._, a young “king’s thegn” (the term applied to him in\r\n      the A.S. version).\r\n\r\n  679 Towcester (“Tovecester,” in Domesday Book) in Northamptonshire,\r\n      Doncaster, and Littleborough have all been suggested, but the place\r\n      has not been identified.

A fifteenth century gloss\r\n      on one of the MSS. has led to her being wrongly identified with the\r\n      Irish Bega, the supposed foundress of St. Bees.\r\n\r\n  691 A Roman station on the Wharfe, now Tadcaster. Probably the nunnery\r\n      was at Healaugh (Heiu’s _laeg_ = territory), three miles north of\r\n      Calcaria. A gravestone bearing Heiu’s name has been found there.\r\n\r\n  692 Cf. c. 12.\r\n\r\n  693 His name does not appear in any of the lists of bishops. There is no\r\n      evidence that a see of Dorchester (cf. III, 7, and note) existed at\r\n      this time, except from this passage and the statement of Florence of\r\n      Worcester to the effect that a fivefold division of the Mercian\r\n      diocese took place in 679, that Dorchester was included in Mercia,\r\n      and that Aetla was appointed as its bishop. Probably this latter\r\n      statement is derived from Bede. It has been proposed to identify\r\n      Aetla with Haedde, Bishop of the West Saxons (III, 7; IV, 12; V,\r\n      18), but it seems unlikely that Bede should not have mentioned their\r\n      identity. The most probable explanation seems to be that a see was\r\n      established about 679 at Dorchester (which may have been under\r\n      Mercia at the time) and that Aetla was its bishop, but that it had\r\n      only a very short existence.\r\n\r\n  694 Cf. _infra_, notes.\r\n\r\n  695 John of Beverley, “Inderauuda” (_v._ V, 2). He and Berthun (_ibid._)\r\n      are said to have founded Beverley. He was consecrated Bishop of\r\n      Hexham, probably in 687, transferred to York 705, when Wilfrid was\r\n      restored to Hexham, and died in 721, soon after his retirement to\r\n      Beverley (V, 6, _ad fin._). As Bishop of Hexham he ordained Bede\r\n      both deacon and priest (V. 24). He had been a pupil of Archbishop\r\n      Theodore (cf. V. 3).\r\n\r\n  696 Wilfrid II, Bishop of York. He succeeded John (V, 6) in 718, and was\r\n      still Bishop of York in 731 when Bede finished the History (cf. V,\r\n      23). In 732 he resigned and was succeeded by Egbert (to whom Bede\r\n      addressed the Ep. ad Egb., and who in 735 received the pallium as\r\n      Archbishop of York). Wilfrid died in 745 (_v._ Continuation, 732,\r\n      735, and 745). His character is highly praised by Alcuin (De Sanct.\r\n      Ebor.).\r\n\r\n  697 Hartlepool and Whitby, both apparently double monasteries.\r\n\r\n  698 Cf. II, 2, p. 84.\r\n\r\n  699 Dr. Stubbs suggests that this sub-king of the Hwiccas may possibly\r\n      be the same as Osric of Northumbria, _v._ V, 23, and note.\r\n\r\n  700 The see was at Worcester. The foundation of the bishopric is\r\n      assigned by Florence of Worcester to the year 679, the date of the\r\n      alleged fivefold division of the Mercian diocese (_v.s._ p. 272,\r\n      note 2), Bosel being appointed bishop.\r\n\r\n  701 Cf. c. 12 and note.\r\n\r\n  702 The consecration of Oftfor is generally placed in 691. It was after\r\n      Wilfrid’s second expulsion, when he was acting as Bishop of\r\n      Leicester. Theodore had died in 690, and Bertwald was not\r\n      consecrated till 693 (_v._ V, 8).\r\n\r\n  703 So Florence of Worcester.\r\n\r\n  704 He was king of the Britons of Loidis and Elmet. It was probably to\r\n      avenge the death of his nephew, Hereric, that Edwin conquered Loidis\r\n      and drove out Cerdic.\r\n\r\n  705 Cf. c. 14, note.\r\n\r\n  706 Hackness, thirteen miles from Whitby and three to the west of\r\n      Scarborough. It was a cell belonging to Whitby. At the dissolution\r\n      under Henry VIII, it contained only four monks, of the Benedictine\r\n      order (Dugdale, “Monasticon”).\r\n\r\n  707 She has been confused with Heiu and with Bega, _v.s._ p. 271, note\r\n      7.\r\n\r\n_  708 I.e._, the Prioress.\r\n\r\n  709 Obviously ballads, probably of a warlike character, existed before\r\n      Caedmon, but he is regarded as the father of English sacred poetry.\r\n      It is a question how far the new impulse arose independently among\r\n      the Anglo-Saxons, or is to be connected with Old Saxon religious\r\n      poetry of which the “Heliand” is the only extant specimen (cf.\r\n      Plummer, _ad loc._). Of the mass of poetry attributed to Caedmon,\r\n      much must be regarded as not his actual work. The fragment\r\n      translated here by Bede has been accepted as genuine by most\r\n      critics. It exists in the Northumbrian dialect at the end of the\r\n      Moore MS. of Bede, and in a West Saxon form in other MSS., as well\r\n      as in the Anglo-Saxon translation of Bede’s History, the\r\n      Northumbrian version being the oldest.\r\n\r\n  710 “Villicus,” A.S. “tun-gerefa” = town-reeve, _i.e._, headman of the\r\n      township.

He was a man of great learning and of scholarly tastes. In\r\n      Bede’s “History of the Abbots,” we are told that he gave eight hides\r\n      of land for a MS. which Benedict Biscop had brought from Rome.\r\n\r\n  734 Cc. 5, 17, 22.\r\n\r\n  735 Cc. 1, 5.\r\n\r\n  736 Apparently at one time joint-king with Hlothere.

IV, 26, _ad fin._ The further\r\n      delay of a year between Bertwald’s election and consecration may\r\n      have been caused by his desire to obtain greater weight as\r\n      consecrated by the Primate of a neighbouring Church (Haddan and\r\n      Stubbs, III, 229).\r\n\r\n  810 For Wictred, _v._ IV, 26, and note. Thomas of Elmham tries to\r\n      identify Suaebhard with Suefred, son of Sebbi, king of the East\r\n      Saxons (_v._ IV, 11, _ad fin._), and says that he made himself king\r\n      of Kent by violence, but this seems very improbable.\r\n\r\n  811 He was Archbishop of Lyons. The Church of Lyons did not obtain the\r\n      primacy over other metropolitan churches till the eleventh century,\r\n      but apparently it held a leading position even before this time.\r\n\r\n  812 He was trained under Theodore and Hadrian in the School of\r\n      Canterbury; cf. V, 23, _ad init._ The date of Gebmund’s death and\r\n      the succession of Tobias cannot be earlier than 696, as Gebmund\r\n      (_v._ IV, 12) appears to have been present at the Kentish\r\n      Witenagemot of Bersted in that year. (Haddan and Stubbs, III, 238,\r\n      241.) Tobias died in 726.\r\n\r\n  813 III, 4, 27; IV, 3, 26, and _infra_ cc. 10, 22, 23, 24.\r\n\r\n  814 The name does not occur in any Celtic literature which we possess.\r\n      All the evidence seems to show that the Celts have always called the\r\n      English “Saxons.” “Ellmyn,” for Allemanni, occurs sometimes in Welsh\r\n      poetry (Rhŷs, “Celtic Britain”).\r\n\r\n  815 The Frisians at this time occupied the coastland from the Maas to\r\n      the region beyond the Ems. The Rugini are probably the Rugii (_v._\r\n      Tacitus, Germania, Chapter XLIII). They were on the shores of the\r\n      Baltic, probably about the mouth of the Oder (the name survives in\r\n      Rügen and Rügenwalde). They are found with other North German tribes\r\n      in the army of Attila, and afterwards formed a settlement on the\r\n      Lower Danube. The Danes were mainly in Jutland, Fünen, and the\r\n      extreme south of Scandinavia. The Huns, who appeared in Europe\r\n      towards the end of the fourth century and menaced both the Eastern\r\n      and Western Empires, were, after Attila’s death, driven eastwards,\r\n      and settled near the Pontus, disappearing among the Bulgarians and\r\n      other kindred tribes. The Old Saxons, or Saxons of the Continent\r\n      (cf. I, 15), occupied both sides of the Elbe. The name Saxon does\r\n      not occur in the oldest accounts of the Germans. Probably it was a\r\n      new name for a union of nations which comprised the Cherusci,\r\n      Chauci, Angrivarii (and perhaps other tribes) of Tacitus. The\r\n      Boructuari are the Bructeri in Westphalia (_v._ Zeuss, “Die\r\n      Deutschen und die Nachbarstämme”).\r\n\r\n  816 Cf. IV, 27 (note) and 28.\r\n\r\n  817 Melrose; cf.

They\r\n      are distinguished from those which are mentioned in c. 15 as “ab\r\n      Hiensium dominio liberi.”\r\n\r\n  820 His baptismal name was Colum (_columba_ = a dove). He is said to\r\n      have acquired the name of Colum-cille, because in his youth he was\r\n      so constantly in the “cell” or oratory.\r\n\r\n  821 Jonah, i, 12.\r\n\r\n  822 Nothing more is known of him. Alcuin mentions him in his life of\r\n      Wilbrord. His name is included in a list of the eleven companions of\r\n      Wilbrord given in a life of St. Suidbert (_v. infra_ c. 11), but no\r\n      value is to be attached to it (_v._ Haddan and Stubbs, III, 225).\r\n      Bede distinctly says that he retired from missionary efforts after\r\n      this unsuccessful attempt.\r\n\r\n  823 The story is told that at one time Rathbed was about to receive\r\n      baptism at the hands of St. Wulfram, Archbishop of Sens, but drew\r\n      back on being told that his ancestors were among the lost, refusing\r\n      to go to Heaven without them. His perpetual wars with the Franks\r\n      ended in his defeat and expulsion, and he died in 719.\r\n\r\n  824 The authority for Wilbrord’s life is Alcuin, who wrote it both in\r\n      prose and verse. Wilbrord was born in 657 or 658 in Northumbria, and\r\n      was handed over by his mother to the monks at Ripon in his infancy.\r\n      His father, Wilgils, became a hermit on a promontory at the mouth of\r\n      the Humber. At the age of twenty he went to Ireland for the sake of\r\n      study and a stricter life. In 690 he set out for Frisland with\r\n      eleven others, landed at Katwyk and went to Utrecht, which was\r\n      afterwards his episcopal see (_v. infra_ c. 11).\r\n\r\n  825 They turned aside to Pippin on finding Rathbed obdurate. Pippin of\r\n      Heristal, Mayor of the Palace of the Austrasian kings, had defeated\r\n      the Neustrians at Testry in 687 and was now the actual ruler of the\r\n      Franks, though it was his grandson, Pippin the Short, who first\r\n      assumed royal power.\r\n\r\n  826 Cf. c. 9, p. 319, and note.\r\n\r\n  827 Roger of Wendover places their mission in 695. It must have been\r\n      later than Wilbrord’s in 690.\r\n\r\n  828 “Satrap,” cf. Stubbs, Constitutional History, i, pp. 41-42. From\r\n      this passage and similar notices of the Continental Saxons he infers\r\n      that they had remained free from Roman influences and from any\r\n      foreign intermixture of blood or institutions. “They had preserved\r\n      the ancient features of German life in their purest forms.... King\r\n      Alfred, when he translated Bede had no difficulty in recognizing in\r\n      the satrap the ealdorman, in the villicus the _tungerefa_, in the\r\n      vicus the _tunscipe_ of his own land.”\r\n\r\n  829 The year cannot be fixed.\r\n\r\n  830 The Church of St. Cunibert, Cologne (Gallican Martyrology, quoted by\r\n      Smith).\r\n\r\n  831 Sergius I: _v.s._ c. 7.\r\n\r\n  832 Alcuin tells how he killed some of the sacred cattle of the god\r\n      Fosite, a son of Balder, in Heligoland, and baptized three men in\r\n      his well.\r\n\r\n  833 A life of him by Marcellinus (_v.s._ c. 9, note on Wictbert) is\r\n      worthless historically. Besides what we learn from Bede, we have the\r\n      date of his death (713) given by the “Annales Francorum.”\r\n\r\n  834 This was after Wilfrid’s second expulsion (V, 19). Bertwald was\r\n      elected in July, 692, and returned from the Continent in August, 693\r\n      (_v.s._ c. 8).\r\n\r\n  835 The usual form of the name is Plectrude.\r\n\r\n  836 Kaiserwerth on the Rhine, where it is believed that his relics still\r\n      remain in a silver shrine in the thirteenth-century church. (For the\r\n      preposition, _v._ II, 14, p. 119, note 5.)\r\n\r\n  837 This was Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. The festival is 22nd November.\r\n      As to the year, Mr. Plummer considers that an entry in an old\r\n      calendar belonging to Epternach, near Trèves, Wilbrord’s own\r\n      monastery, giving the date 695, is almost certainly by Wilbrord\r\n      himself.\r\n\r\n  838 Utrecht. A distinction has been drawn between the two places,\r\n      Wiltaburg, or Wiltenburg, being a village near Utrecht, but the\r\n      names appear to be interchangeable.\r\n\r\n  839 The Church of St. Saviour. He also rebuilt a small church which had\r\n      been destroyed by the pagans, and consecrated it in honour of St.\r\n      Martin (Letter of St. Boniface to Pope Stephen). The cathedral\r\n      stands on the site of this church.\r\n\r\n  840 Bede writes in 731. As Alcuin says Wilbrord lived to be eighty-one\r\n      years of age, he must have died in 738 or 739. Boniface is fairly\r\n      accurate when he says that he preached for fifty years.\r\n\r\n  841 Mr. Skene (“Celtic Scotland,” i., p. 219) has shown that the place\r\n      cannot be Cunningham in Ayrshire, which was not in Northumbria, but\r\n      in Strathclyde, and not at that time subject to Northumbria. He\r\n      suggests Tininghame in East Lothian, which Simeon of Durham calls\r\n      Intiningaham, and places in the diocese of Lindisfarne (C being a\r\n      scribe’s error for T). Chester-le-Street (Saxon: Cunungaceaster) has\r\n      also been suggested.\r\n\r\n  842 Melrose, _v._ III, 26; IV, 27; V, 9.\r\n\r\n  843 Cf. III, 19. On mediaeval visions, cf.

He became\r\n      first Prior, or Provost, then Abbot of Melrose, and succeeded\r\n      Eadfrid, who died in 721, as Bishop of Lindisfarne. He enriched\r\n      Lindisfarne with two treasures of art: a beautiful stone cross which\r\n      he erected there, and a cover of gold and jewels for the Lindisfarne\r\n      Gospels, written by Eadfrid in honour of St. Cuthbert.

If so, they must have been Britons of Strathclyde. The\r\n      Welsh only conformed 755-777. The reference may be to those of the\r\n      Cornish Britons, subject to the West Saxons, who were led in 705 by\r\n      Aldhelm’s letter to Geraint to adopt the Catholic Easter (_v.\r\n      infra_, c. 18).\r\n\r\n  854 Ninth Abbot of Iona, 679-704, the author of the Life of St. Columba.\r\n\r\n  855 Of Northumbria.

(The dates are those of Tighernach and the\r\n      “Annales Cambriae.”)\r\n\r\n  858 Adamnan’s “De Locis Sanctis,” and Bede’s account here, are the only\r\n      sources of information with regard to this bishop. Adamnan’s book is\r\n      based on the narrative of Arculf compared with other authorities.\r\n      Bede, again, in his own work on the the same subject, made\r\n      selections from Adamnan, using also other authorities, _e.g._\r\n      Josephus.\r\n\r\n_  859 I.e._, he had copies made of it.\r\n\r\n  860 Nevertheless he quotes his own book rather than Adamnan’s.\r\n\r\n  861 Cf. Warren and Conder, “Survey of Western Palestine”: “Bethlehem, a\r\n      well-built stone town, standing on a narrow ridge which runs east\r\n      and west ... towards the east is the open market place, and, beyond\r\n      this, the convent in which is the fourth century church of St. Mary,\r\n      including the Grotto of the Nativity beneath the main apse.”\r\n\r\n  862 “Vulturnus” seems to be distinguished from its Greek equivalent,\r\n      “Eurus.”\r\n\r\n  863 The Basilica of the Anastasis was completed by Constantine in 335\r\n      A.D., and destroyed in 614 by Chosroes II, King of Persia. Other\r\n      ancient travellers besides Arculf describe the Holy Places.\r\n      Eucherius, writing about 427-440, mentions the Martyrium, Golgotha\r\n      and the Anastasis, and describes their respective sites in similar\r\n      terms. Theodorus (about 530 A.D.) alludes to the Invention of the\r\n      Holy Cross by Helena, but the earliest authorities do not connect\r\n      her with it.\r\n\r\n  864 “Brucosa.” The adjective is not found in the dictionaries. But\r\n      Ducange has the following words from which one may, perhaps, infer\r\n      an adjective of kindred meaning: “_Brua_, idem quod supra _Brossa_,\r\n      silvula, dumetum,” “_Bruarium_, ericetum,” and “_Broca_, ager\r\n      incultus, dumetum.”\r\n\r\n  865 The Basilica of the Ascension, on the summit of Mount Olivet, is\r\n      mentioned by the Pilgrim of Bordeaux who was in Jerusalem in 333\r\n      A.D. No traces of the church have been found. He also speaks of the\r\n      Anastasis, which was being built at the time.\r\n\r\n  866 Saewulf (1102 A.D.) writes: “Below is the place called Golgotha,\r\n      where Adam is said to have been raised to life by the Blood of our\r\n      Lord which fell upon him, as is said in the Passion, ‘And many\r\n      bodies of the saints which slept arose.’ But in the sentences of St.\r\n      Augustine we read that he was buried in Hebron, where also the three\r\n      patriarchs were afterwards buried with their wives, Abraham with\r\n      Sarah, Isaac with Rebecca, and Jacob with Leah, as well as the bones\r\n      of Joseph which the children of Israel carried with them from\r\n      Egypt.”\r\n\r\n  867 He died at Driffield (supposed to mean the “field of Deira”), in the\r\n      East Riding of Yorkshire, on 14th December, 705 (Saxon Chronicle).\r\n\r\n  868 Bede and the Chronicle do not mention the usurper Eadwulf, who held\r\n      the sovereignty for eight weeks. With Aldfrid the greatness of\r\n      Northumbria, which had begun to decline after Egfrid’s defeat and\r\n      death, passed away, except for a brief revival in the time of\r\n      Eadbert and his brother, Archbishop Egbert. Osred was a tyrannical\r\n      and lawless boy, and a period of political and ecclesiastical\r\n      trouble set in (cf. Bede, “Epistola ad Egbertum”; Boniface, Ep. 62,\r\n      etc.).\r\n\r\n  869 III, 7; IV, 12.\r\n\r\n_  870 Infra_ c. 23. He has been mentioned, c. 13, _ad fin._ He studied\r\n      under Aldhelm at Malmesbury (_v. infra_).\r\n\r\n  871 The greatest scholar of his time and the man of widest influence as\r\n      a teacher. He was a West Saxon, of royal blood, born about 639; he\r\n      studied first under Hadrian in the School of Canterbury, then under\r\n      Maildufus (_v. infra_), was ordained priest by Bishop Hlothere\r\n      (Leutherius, _v._ III, 7), and about the year 675 became Abbot of\r\n      Malmesbury, which under his rule grew to be a place of importance\r\n      and attracted crowds of students. On one occasion he went by\r\n      invitation of Pope Sergius to Rome. He became Bishop of Sherborne,\r\n      when in 705 the West Saxon diocese was divided (_v. infra_). He died\r\n      in 709 in the little church of Doulting in Somerset and was buried\r\n      in St. Michael’s Church at Malmesbury. He greatly strengthened the\r\n      Church in Wessex by his influence with King Ini and his zeal in\r\n      building churches and monasteries in various places. His widespread\r\n      influence, as well as his generous use of it, is shown by his letter\r\n      to Wilfrid’s clergy after the Council of Estrefeld, exhorting them\r\n      to remain faithful to their bishop (v. Haddan and Stubbs, III, 254).\r\n\r\n  872 In 705. The bishopric of the West Saxons was the only one which\r\n      Theodore did not subdivide. The delay may have been due to the\r\n      political disturbances of the time, and these had come to an end\r\n      under the rule of Ini. Haedde’s death removed a further difficulty.\r\n      He seems to have resisted Bertwald’s attempt to divide the diocese,\r\n      for we find in 704 a council threatening the West Saxons with\r\n      excommunication if the division is not carried out. Hampshire,\r\n      Surrey, and, for a time, Sussex, were assigned to Winchester;\r\n      Berkshire, Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, and Somersetshire to Sherborne\r\n      (Haddan and Stubbs, III, 276), but the authorities differ on this\r\n      point. After the Conquest, the combined bishoprics of Sherborne and\r\n      Ramsbury (founded in 909 for Wiltshire) had their see established at\r\n      Old Sarum.\r\n\r\n  873 Cf. Preface, p. 3, and note, and IV, 16. In 744 he resigned his see\r\n      and died in 745. It appears from a letter of Boniface to him that he\r\n      became blind in his old age.\r\n\r\n  874 Malmesbury. It was founded by an Irish monk and scholar, Maildufus\r\n      (Irish “Maelduib”), as a small settlement living under monastic rule\r\n      (_v.s._ note on Aldhelm).\r\n\r\n  875 His letter to Geraint or Gerontius, king of Dumnonia (Devon and\r\n      Cornwall). A West Saxon synod in 705 appointed Aldhelm to write a\r\n      book, “quo maligna haeresis Britonum destrueretur” (Faricius, Life\r\n      of Aldhelm). He appears to have influenced only those Britons who\r\n      were subject to the West Saxons. Devon and Cornwall did not finally\r\n      conform to the Catholic Easter till early in the tenth century.\r\n\r\n  876 Cf. IV, 10 (note on Hildilid).\r\n\r\n  877 A poet of the fifth century (circ. 450), author of a poem called\r\n      “Carmen Paschale.” He translated it into prose and called it “Opus\r\n      Paschale.” Aldhelm wrote his prose work first.\r\n\r\n  878 His style is turgid and grandiloquent, and, owing to the high\r\n      estimation in which he was held, his influence in this respect on\r\n      contemporary writing was harmful.\r\n\r\n  879 Cf. _infra_ c. 23. A letter to him from Archbishop Bertwald is\r\n      extant. We do not know how long he lived. We have his signature to a\r\n      charter of 739.\r\n\r\n  880 Cf. IV, 15. The see was established at Selsey. The date of this\r\n      event is not known (Matthew of Westminster is the only authority for\r\n      711). Bede indicates it very vaguely (“quibus administrantibus”),\r\n      and does not make it clear to whose administration he alludes. The\r\n      more obvious reference is surely to Daniel and Aldhelm, the passage\r\n      about Forthere being parenthetical, but the other view has the\r\n      authority of Haddan and Stubbs (III, 296), viz., that he means\r\n      Daniel and Forthere, and that thus the date is fixed to some time\r\n      after Aldhelm’s death (709).\r\n\r\n  881 Selsey, cf. IV, 13, 14.\r\n\r\n  882 The vacancy was filled in 733 by the appointment of Sigfrid (_v._\r\n      Continuation).\r\n\r\n  883 Cf. c. 18, _ad init._ His fourth year was 709.\r\n\r\n  884 C. 13 and _infra_ c. 19 _ad fin._, and c. 24. For a similar action,\r\n      cf. Caedwalla and Ini (_v.s._ c. 7) and (_infra_) Offa.\r\n\r\n  885 Constantine I, 708-715.\r\n\r\n  886 709-716. St. Boniface (Letter to Ethelbald) gives Ceolred a very bad\r\n      character, and says that he died impenitent at a banquet, seized\r\n      with sudden madness. He alludes to him and Osred of Northumbria as\r\n      the first kings who tampered with the privileges of the Church.\r\n\r\n  887 III, 30, and IV, 6. Sighere reigned jointly with Sebbi. They were\r\n      succeeded by Sebbi’s sons, Sighard and Swefred (IV, 11). Offa\r\n      probably succeeded them just before this time (709); William of\r\n      Malmesbury says he reigned for a short time. He was succeeded by\r\n      Selred (d. 746).\r\n\r\n  888 St. Matt., xix, 29; St. Mark, x, 30; St. Luke, xviii, 30.\r\n\r\n  889 Oundle in Northamptonshire, where he had a monastery on land given\r\n      him by Wulfhere of Mercia. For the form of the name, cf. _infra_,\r\n      “in provincia Undalum.” Here the preposition is prefixed as often;\r\n      _v._ II, 14, note. Wilfrid died on a Thursday in October: there is\r\n      some uncertainty about the day of the month.\r\n\r\n  890 Cf. the epitaph (_infra_) and c. 24, where Bede places his\r\n      consecration in 664. This is supported by William of Malmesbury, but\r\n      Eddius says he was bishop for forty-six years.\r\n\r\n  891 Ripon, _v. infra_, p. 56. In the tenth century, Odo, Archbishop of\r\n      Canterbury, removed certain relics to Canterbury, believing them to\r\n      be the body of Wilfrid. At Ripon it was maintained that the relics\r\n      were those of Wilfrid II.\r\n\r\n  892 Our main authority for the life of Wilfrid is Eddius (_v._ IV, 2).\r\n      Bede’s account is remarkable for its omissions, though it gives a\r\n      few facts which Eddius omits.\r\n\r\n  893 His birth must be placed in 634 (cf. _infra_, his consecration at\r\n      the age of thirty). His father was a Northumbrian thegn. He is said\r\n      to have had an unkind stepmother. He was sent by his father to the\r\n      court of Oswy, thence, by Eanfled (cf. II, 9, 20; III, 15, 24, _et\r\n      saep._) to Lindisfarne, at that time under the rule of Aidan.\r\n\r\n  894 III, 8. He was the son of Eadbald (II, 5, 6, 9, _et saep._).\r\n      Eanfled’s mother was the sister of Eadbald, the Kentish princess\r\n      Ethelberg (“Tata”), wife of Edwin (II, 9, 11, 20).\r\n\r\n  895 II, 18 _et saep._\r\n\r\n  896 IV, 18, and note.\r\n\r\n  897 Cf. III, 25. Annemundus was the name of the Archbishop. Dalfinus,\r\n      Count of Lyons, was his brother. Eddius makes the same mistake.\r\n\r\n  898 A daughter of the Count.\r\n\r\n  899 He presented Wilfrid to the Pope, Eugenius I. A leaden “bulla” with\r\n      the name of Boniface, Archdeacon, inscribed upon it was found at\r\n      Whitby not long ago.\r\n\r\n_  900 I.e._, to Annemundus.\r\n\r\n  901 This seems to be another mistake in which Bede follows Eddius. It\r\n      was probably Ebroin (_v._ IV, 1, note), Mayor of the Palace to her\r\n      infant son Clothaire III, who put Annemundus to death. Baldhild was,\r\n      however, regent at the time. Eddius calls her a Jezebel, but all\r\n      that we know of her shows her to have been a most pious and\r\n      charitable lady, and she has been canonized by the Church. She was\r\n      especially active in her efforts to stop the traffic in slaves. She\r\n      herself, though she is said to have been of noble English birth, had\r\n      been sold as a slave into Gaul. She was married first to Ercinwald,\r\n      Mayor of the Palace, the predecessor of Ebroin (_v._ III, 19), and\r\n      afterwards to Clovis II, King of Neustria and Burgundy, 638-656.\r\n      Baldhild ended her life in the monastery of Chelles (_v._ III, 8,\r\n      and note).\r\n\r\n  902 III, 14, 21, 24, 25, 28. He was a friend of Coinwalch of Wessex,\r\n      from whom, as Eddius says, he learned to love the Roman rules.\r\n\r\n  903 Possibly Stamford, in Lincolnshire; more probably, since the land\r\n      belonged to Alchfrid, Stamford Bridge, on the Derwent, in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n  904 Cf. III, 25, where the extent is given as forty families, _i.e._,\r\n      “hides.”\r\n\r\n  905 Cf. III, 7, 25, 28; IV, 1, 12. For the Gewissae, _v._ II, 5 and\r\n      note.\r\n\r\n  906 At the synod of Whitby, 664 (III, 25).\r\n\r\n  907 Tuda (III, 26) had died of the plague of 664. For Wilfrid’s\r\n      consecration, _v._ III, 28, _ad init._, and note. Agilbert was not\r\n      Bishop of Paris till 666 (cf. III, 25, p. 194, note).\r\n\r\n  908 Cf. III, 28, and note. Wilfrid did not return to Britain till 666.\r\n      Bede omits the story of his shipwreck on the coast of Sussex, and\r\n      says nothing of the three years spent as Abbot of Ripon, whither he\r\n      retired on finding Ceadda installed in his place. During this time\r\n      he acted occasionally as Bishop for Mercia, where the see was vacant\r\n      by the death of Jaruman in 667, and for Kent, during part of the\r\n      vacancy between the death of Deusdedit in 664 and Theodore’s arrival\r\n      in 669.\r\n\r\n  909 The same Witan which elected Wilfrid decided to transfer the\r\n      Northumbrian see from Lindisfarne back to York, where Paulinus had\r\n      originally established it.\r\n\r\n  910 In 678, _v._ IV, 12, and note. Bede passes over nine years of\r\n      ceaseless activity in the diocese. It was during this time that\r\n      Wilfrid built his great churches.\r\n\r\n  911 Eddius says that he went there by his own wish. This is not the\r\n      occasion referred to in III, 13 (_v._ note, _ad loc._). Ebroin, from\r\n      motives of private enmity (Wilfrid had helped his enemy, Dagobert II\r\n      of Austrasia), attempted to bribe Aldgils to kill or surrender\r\n      Wilfrid, but his offer was indignantly rejected.\r\n\r\n  912 Cc. 10, 11; cf. III, 13.\r\n\r\n  913 On the way he visited Dagobert II of Austrasia, and Perctarit, king\r\n      of the Lombards.\r\n\r\n  914 At a council of fifty bishops held in the Lateran in 679. Theodore\r\n      had sent documents stating his side of the case in charge of a monk\r\n      named Coenwald. For Agatho, _v._ IV, 18. The decision was that\r\n      Wilfrid should be reinstated in his bishopric and the intruding\r\n      bishops removed, but that afterwards he should appoint coadjutors\r\n      who should be consecrated by the Archbishop.\r\n\r\n  915 This council was held in 680 in preparation for the Council at\r\n      Constantinople in 680-681, against the Monothelites (cf. IV, 17, 18,\r\n      and notes).\r\n\r\n  916 In 680. Here Bede strangely omits important events. On Wilfrid’s\r\n      return to Northumbria he was accused of having procured his\r\n      acquittal by bribery and was imprisoned for nine months, first at\r\n      Bromnis (unidentified) and then at Dunbar. Being released at the\r\n      request of Aebba, Abbess of Coldingham (_v._ IV, 19, 25), who was\r\n      Egfrid’s aunt, he went first to Mercia and then to Wessex, but was\r\n      expelled from both provinces. Egfrid’s sister Osthryth was the wife\r\n      of Ethelred of Mercia, and in Wessex the king, Centwine, had married\r\n      a sister of the Northumbrian queen, Eormenburg.\r\n\r\n  917 IV, 13.\r\n\r\n  918 IV, 13, 16. His connection with Caedwalla of Wessex is to be placed\r\n      here (IV, 16).\r\n\r\n  919 In 686 he was restored to the bishopric of York and the monastery of\r\n      Ripon. The diocese over which he was now placed was greatly\r\n      circumscribed. Lindsey and Abercorn, besides having been detached by\r\n      the subdivision, had both ceased to belong to Northumbria;\r\n      Lindisfarne and Hexham were separate bishoprics and were merely\r\n      administered by Wilfrid till the appointment of Eadbert to\r\n      Lindisfarne and of John to Hexham. The restoration of Wilfrid was\r\n      brought about by Theodore who had become reconciled to him and\r\n      induced Aldfrid to allow him to be reinstated.\r\n\r\n  920 This was his second expulsion, in 691. Dissensions had arisen about\r\n      various matters. The most important were the attempt, resisted by\r\n      Wilfrid, to form Ripon into a separate see, and the requirement that\r\n      he should accept the decrees of Theodore of 678. To accept these\r\n      would have been equivalent to a rejection of the Pope’s judgement in\r\n      his case.\r\n\r\n  921 Bede omits here Wilfrid’s second sojourn in Mercia (eleven years),\r\n      when he acted temporarily as Bishop of the Middle English (he\r\n      alludes to it in IV, 23), and the great Council, representative of\r\n      the whole English Church, summoned by Aldfrid in 702 and held at a\r\n      place in Northumbria (unidentified; possibly Austerfield in the West\r\n      Riding of Yorkshire) called by Eddius “Ouestraefelda” and\r\n      “Aetswinapathe” (supposed to mean “at the swine’s path,” or\r\n      “Edwinspath”). At this Council Wilfrid was excommunicated and\r\n      deprived of all his possessions except the monastery of Ripon. He\r\n      appealed again to the Apostolic see and returned to Mercia. Probably\r\n      in the following year he set out for Rome, visiting Wilbrord in\r\n      Frisia by the way (cf. III, 13).\r\n\r\n  922 John VI, 701-705. Bertwald had sent envoys to represent Wilfrid’s\r\n      opponents. The investigation took four months, during which seventy\r\n      sittings of the Council were held.\r\n\r\n  923 Bertwald was admonished to hold a synod and come to an agreement\r\n      with Wilfrid. In the event of failure, both parties were to appear\r\n      in Rome. The letter is cautious and conciliatory in tone.\r\n\r\n  924 Cf. _supra_, p. 352.\r\n\r\n  925 Cf. _supra_, p. 349.\r\n\r\n  926 Meaux, cf.

Bertwald was present and adopted\r\n      a conciliatory line.\r\n\r\n  933 He was restored only to Hexham and to his monastery at Ripon.

How\r\n      much he had to do with the nineteen years’ cycle seems altogether\r\n      uncertain. He took a leading part in the Council of Nicaea (325\r\n      A.D.), but there is no proof that the Council formally adopted the\r\n      cycle, as has been supposed. It had been in use long before, but it\r\n      may have received authoritative sanction at Nicaea. Eusebius wrote a\r\n      treatise on Easter, of which a fragment is extant.\r\n\r\n  974 A presbyter of Caesarea, the founder of the famous library in that\r\n      place. He was martyred in 309 A.D. Eusebius wrote his life, but the\r\n      work is lost.\r\n\r\n  975 Archbishop of Alexandria, 385-412. He made a cycle of 418 years (19\r\n      × 22) for Theodosius, and reckoned the days on which Easter would\r\n      fall for 100 years from the first year of the consulate of\r\n      Theodosius (380 A.D.).\r\n\r\n  976 The great Archbishop of Alexandria, 412-444. He shortened the cycle\r\n      of Theophilus, making a cycle of ninety-five years (19 × 5), for the\r\n      sake of convenience. Part of his “Computus Paschalis” remains.\r\n\r\n  977 A monk of the Western Church in the sixth century. The surname,\r\n      “Exiguus,” refers, not to his stature, but to his humbleness of\r\n      heart. Our method of dating from the Birth of Christ was begun by\r\n      him. He revived the cycle of Victorius (or Victorinus) of Aquitaine\r\n      (463 A.D.), hence called Dionysian. It was a cycle of 532 years,\r\n      _i.e._ the lunar cycle of 19 × the solar cycle of 28.\r\n\r\n  978 Cf. p. 369, note 5.\r\n\r\n  979 Job, i, 20.\r\n\r\n  980 Gen., xli, 14.\r\n\r\n  981 St. Matt., xvi, 18.\r\n\r\n  982 Acts, viii, 20 (Vulgate).

He was killed in battle, but\r\n      neither the locality nor the war is known.\r\n\r\n  989 He reigned two years, _v. infra_ c. 23. He belonged to a younger\r\n      branch of the royal house of Northumbria. His father’s name was\r\n      Cuthwine, and Ceolwulf, who succeeded Osric (c. 23), was his\r\n      brother.\r\n\r\n  990 Or, perhaps, “bishop;” cf. III, 4, note. For the circumstances which\r\n      led Egbert to undertake his work among the Columban monasteries,\r\n      _v.s._ c. 9. As the events narrated there were prior to 690\r\n      (Wilbrord’s mission to Frisia), we may, perhaps, assume that he had\r\n      been labouring during this long interval among the Columban\r\n      monasteries in Ireland. In III, 4, Bede places Egbert’s arrival in\r\n      Iona a year earlier.\r\n\r\n  991 Rom., x, 2.\r\n\r\n  992 Cf. p. 372. This seems to be the meaning of the somewhat obscure\r\n      sentence, “... celebrationem, ut diximus, praecipuae solemnitatis\r\n      sub figura coronae perpetis agere perdocuit.”\r\n\r\n  993 For the conversion of the Britons to Roman usages, _v._ cc. 15 and\r\n      18, notes.\r\n\r\n  994 This is accurate enough in round numbers. Aidan’s mission (_v._ III,\r\n      3) was probably in 635.\r\n\r\n_  995 I.e._, 24th April. According to the Celtic rule, Easter Day could\r\n      never have been so late, 21st April being the latest possible day,\r\n      while the Romans might celebrate as late as 25th April.\r\n\r\n  996 Osric had succeeded in 718. Simeon of Durham says he was a son of\r\n      King “Alfrid.” It has been suggested (Dr. Stubbs, in Dict. of\r\n      Christian Biog.) that this may mean Alchfrid, son of Oswy (III, 14,\r\n      _et saep._), further, that this Osric is to be identified with the\r\n      Hwiccian sub-king, mentioned in IV, 23, who may have found a refuge\r\n      in Mercia, when Alchfrid was disinherited. Against this it has been\r\n      maintained that the statement of Simeon of Durham may, with greater\r\n      probability, be referred to Aldfrid, the successor of Egfrid and\r\n      father of Osred.\r\n\r\n  997 Cf. IV, 26, and V, 8.\r\n\r\n  998 From Bede we should infer that they all succeeded in 725, and the\r\n      evidence of charters goes to show that Eadbert and Ethelbert began\r\n      to reign jointly in that year. Florence of Worcester makes Eadbert\r\n      and Ethelbert reign successively, and William of Malmesbury gives\r\n      successive reigns of considerable length to all three brothers. This\r\n      prolongs Alric’s life beyond probability, and as his reign rests on\r\n      no early evidence, Dr. Stubbs is inclined to set it aside\r\n      altogether.\r\n\r\n  999 Cf. c. 8.\r\n\r\n 1000 Cf.

Though he is not included in Bede’s list of Bretwaldas\r\n      (II, 5), he established the supremacy of Mercia for twenty years\r\n      over all England south of the Humber, till in 754 Wessex freed\r\n      itself in the battle of Burford.

He conquered the country about Bamborough, which\r\n      he is said to have founded (cf. III, 6), and settled his people\r\n      here. Deira, which was for a time a separate kingdom, was finally\r\n      united to Bernicia under the strong rule of Oswald, Ida’s great\r\n      grandson (_ib. ad fin._), who through his mother, Acha, was\r\n      descended also from the royal house of Deira.\r\n\r\n 1035 By Scotland, as usual, Ireland is meant.\r\n\r\n 1036 Wulfhere’s death is not mentioned in the narrative.\r\n\r\n 1037 This is not in the narrative.

He was persecuted\r\n      under Decius, and again under Valerian, but escaped. His history is\r\n      told in the poems of Paulinus, Bishop of Nola (409-431).\r\n\r\n 1053 This work is not known to exist. Probably the saint is Anastasius\r\n      the Younger, Patriarch of Antioch, killed in 610 by the Jews in a\r\n      sedition on 21st December, and in the Roman martyrology honoured on\r\n      that day as a martyr (_v._ Butler, “Lives of the Saints”).\r\n\r\n 1054 Cf. IV, 26-32.\r\n\r\n 1055 For Benedict and Ceolfrid, _v._ IV, 18. Huaetbert belonged to the\r\n      monastery of Wearmouth and Jarrow from his earliest childhood, and\r\n      succeeded Ceolfrid as abbot in 716. He survived Bede. The latter\r\n      dedicated his commentary on the Apocalypse and the De temp. Rat. to\r\n      him under his name of Eusebius given him for his piety (_v._ Bede’s\r\n      Hist. Abb. and Anon., Hist. Abb.).\r\n\r\n 1056 (Only names which have not occurred in the narrative are annotated;\r\n      references for those already mentioned will be found in the Index.)\r\n      The Continuation is by a later hand. But Mr. Plummer considers that\r\n      the entries under the years 731, 732, 733 and 734, may have been\r\n      added by Bede himself. They appear in the great Moore MS., and those\r\n      for 733 and 734 also in another eighth century MS. The entries\r\n      enclosed in square brackets are found in a fifteenth century MS.\r\n\r\n 1057 He succeeded Wilfrid II, and two years later became Archbishop of\r\n      York (_v. infra_ under 735). It was to him that Bede addressed the\r\n      “Epist. ad Egberctum.”\r\n\r\n 1058 Bishop of Lindsey.\r\n\r\n 1059 Bishop of Selsey.\r\n\r\n_ 1060 I.e._, of York.\r\n\r\n 1061 Bishop of Hexham.\r\n\r\n 1062 Bishop of Whitern.\r\n\r\n 1063 The early authorities differ as to the year, but this is the\r\n      traditional date, and is usually accepted.\r\n\r\n 1064 King of Northumbria 737-758 (_v. infra_); died in 768. He was a son\r\n      of Eata, called by Nennius, Eata “Glinmaur,” a descendant of Ida,\r\n      and was the brother of Archbishop Egbert. Under him the Northumbrian\r\n      power revived for a period.\r\n\r\n 1065 He was the kinsman and predecessor of Cuthred (_v. infra_).\r\n\r\n 1066 Archbishop of Canterbury in succession to Nothelm. The first\r\n      archbishop not buried in St. Augustine’s, _v._ II, 3, p. 90, note.\r\n\r\n 1067 Bishop of Lindisfarne in succession to Ethelwald (V, 12, _ad fin._,\r\n      note).\r\n\r\n 1068 Probably a son of that Eadwulf who usurped the throne of Northumbria\r\n      at Aldfrid’s death (V, 18); cf. Simeon of Durham, II, 38 (Rolls\r\n      Series), “Arwine filius Eadulfi.”\r\n\r\n 1069 Not known.\r\n\r\n 1070 Charles Martel.\r\n\r\n 1071 Pippin the Short. Carloman resigned in 747, and became a monk.\r\n\r\n 1072 There is a letter of Boniface (_v._ Haddan and Stubbs III, 358) to a\r\n      priest, Herefrid, who is supposed to be the man mentioned here.\r\n\r\n 1073 This seems confused and obscure. The West Saxons under Cuthred threw\r\n      off the Mercian yoke in the insurrection which culminated in the\r\n      battle of Burford (_v._ V. 23, p. 380, note 9). Oengus or Angus (the\r\n      Brythonic form is Ungust), son of Fergus, was a Pictish king who\r\n      crushed the Dalriadic Scots, and, in alliance with Eadbert of\r\n      Northumbria, conquered the Britons of Strathclyde. But this does not\r\n      explain the strange statement which brings him into connection with\r\n      Ethelbald of Mercia. Nor is it told who Eanred was. Theudor was a\r\n      king of the Britons of Strathclyde. Kyle is a district in Ayrshire.\r\n\r\n 1074 Adopting the emendation “quinto Idus” (Hussey). The date is thus\r\n      right for the eclipses, but the year is the sixteenth of Eadbert.\r\n      Probably the numeral (XVI) has fallen out, and the passage ought to\r\n      run: “anno regni Eadbercti XVI, quinto Id. Ian.”\r\n\r\n 1075 The great missionary bishop of Germany, a West Saxon by birth. He\r\n      crossed to the Continent _circ._ 716, and, supported by Charles\r\n      Martel and his sons, evangelized Central Europe, became Archbishop\r\n      of Mainz, and founded sees throughout Germany. Finally he was\r\n      martyred in Frisland. Lul, a West Saxon, was his successor, not\r\n      Redger, but it has been suggested that this may be another name for\r\n      him.
