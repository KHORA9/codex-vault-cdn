Shelley, Bart._]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE & LETTERS OF MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT SHELLEY\r\n\r\nby\r\n\r\nMRS. JULIAN MARSHALL\r\n\r\nWith Portraits and Facsimile\r\n\r\nIn Two Volumes\r\n\r\nVOL. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon\r\nRichard Bentley & Son\r\nPublishers in Ordinary to Her Majesty the Queen\r\n1889\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following biography was undertaken at the request of Sir Percy and\r\nLady Shelley, and has been compiled from the MS. journals and letters in\r\ntheir possession, which were entrusted to me, without reserve, for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe earlier portions of the journal having been placed also at Professor\r\nDowden's disposal for his _Life of Shelley_, it will be found that in my\r\nfirst volume many passages indispensable to a life of Mary Shelley have\r\nalready appeared, in one form or another, in Professor Dowden's pages.\r\nThis fact I have had to ignore, having indeed settled on the quotations\r\nnecessary to my narrative before the _Life of Shelley_ appeared. They are\r\ngiven without comment or dilution, just as they occur; where omissions are\r\nmade it is in order to avoid repetition, or because the everyday entries\r\nrefer to trivial circumstances uninteresting to the general reader.\r\n\r\nLetters which have previously been published are shortened when they are\r\nonly of moderate interest; unpublished letters are given complete wherever\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThose who hope to find in these pages much new circumstantial evidence on\r\nthe vexed subject of Shelley's separation from his first wife will be\r\ndisappointed. No contemporary document now exists which puts the case\r\nbeyond the reach of argument. Collateral evidence is not wanting, but even\r\nwere this not beyond the scope of the present work it would be wrong on\r\nthe strength of it to assert more than that Shelley himself felt certain\r\nof his wife's unfaithfulness. Of that there is no doubt, nor of the fact\r\nthat all such evidence as did afterwards transpire went to prove him more\r\nlikely to have been right than wrong in his belief.\r\n\r\nMy first thanks are due to Sir Percy and Lady Shelley for the use of their\r\ninvaluable documents,--for the photographs of original pictures which form\r\nthe basis of the illustrations,--and last, not least, for their kindly\r\nhelp and sympathy during the fulfilment of my task.\r\n\r\nI wish especially to express my gratitude to Mrs. Charles Call for her\r\nkind permission to me to print the letters of her father, Mr. Trelawny,\r\nwhich are among the most interesting of my unpublished materials.\r\n\r\nI have to thank Miss Stuart, from whom I obtained important letters from\r\nMr. Baxter and Godwin; and Mr. A. C. Haden, through whom I made the\r\nacquaintance of Miss Christy Baxter.\r\n\r\nTo Professor Dowden, and, above all, to Mr. Garnett, I am indebted for\r\nmuch valuable help, I may say, of all kinds.\r\n\r\nFLORENCE A.

She is remembered as\r\n_Mary Shelley_, wife of the poet. In any complete account of his life she\r\nplays, next to his, the most important part. Young as she was during the\r\nfew years they passed together, her character and her intellect were\r\nstrong enough to affect, to modify, in some degree to mould his. That he\r\nbecame what he did is in great measure due to her. This, if nothing more\r\nwere known of her, would be sufficient to stamp her as a remarkable woman,\r\nof rare ability and moral excellence, well deserving of a niche in the\r\nalmost universal biographical series of the present day. But, besides\r\nthis, she would have been eminent among her sex at any time, in any\r\ncircumstances, and would, it cannot be doubted, have achieved greater\r\npersonal fame than she actually did but for the fact that she became, at a\r\nvery early age, the wife of Shelley. Not only has his name overshadowed\r\nher, but the circumstances of her association with him were such as to\r\ncheck to a considerable extent her own sources of invention and activity.\r\nHad that freedom been her lot in which her mother's destiny shaped itself,\r\nher talents must have asserted themselves as not inferior, as in some\r\nrespects superior, to those of Mary Wollstonecraft. This is the answer to\r\nthe question, sometimes asked,--as if, in becoming Shelley's wife, she had\r\nforfeited all claim to individual consideration,--why any separate Life of\r\nher should be written at all. Even as a completion of Shelley's own story,\r\nMary's Life is necessary. There remains the fact that her husband's\r\nbiographers have been busy with her name. It is impossible now to pass it\r\nover in silence and indifference. She has been variously misunderstood. It\r\nhas been her lot to be idealised as one who gave up all for love, and to\r\nbe condemned and anathematised for the very same reason. She has been\r\nextolled for perfections she did not possess, and decried for the absence\r\nof those she possessed in the highest degree. She has been lauded as a\r\ngenius, and depreciated as one overrated, whose talent would never have\r\nbeen heard of at all but for the name of Shelley. To her husband she has\r\nbeen esteemed alternately a blessing and the reverse.\r\n\r\nAs a fact, it is probable that no woman of like endowments and promise\r\never abdicated her own individuality in favour of another so\r\ntranscendently greater. To consider Mary altogether apart from Shelley is,\r\nindeed, not possible, but the study of the effect, on life and character,\r\nof this memorable union is unique of its kind. From Shelley's point of\r\nview it has been variously considered; from Mary's, as yet, not at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Wollstonecraft Godwin was born on the 30th of August 1797.\r\n\r\nHer father, the philosopher and philosophical novelist, William Godwin,\r\nbegan his career as a Dissenting minister in Norfolk, and something of the\r\npreacher's character adhered to him all his life. Not the apostolic\r\npreacher. No enthusiasm of faith or devotion, no constraining fervour,\r\neliciting the like in others, were his, but a calm, earnest, philosophic\r\nspirit, with an irresistible impulse to guide and advise others.\r\n\r\nThis same calm rationalism got the better, in no long time, of his\r\nreligious creed, which he seems to have abandoned slowly, gradually, and\r\ndeliberately, without painful struggle. His religion, of the head alone,\r\nwas easily replaced by other views for which intellectual qualities were\r\nall-sufficient. Of a cool, unemotional temperament, safe from any snares\r\nof passion or imagination, he became the very type of a town philosopher.\r\nAbstractions of the intellect and the philosophy of politics were his\r\nworld. He had a true townsman's love of the theatre, but external nature\r\nfor the most part left him unaffected, as it found him. With the most\r\nexalted opinion of his own genius and merit, he was nervously susceptible\r\nto the criticism of others, yet always ready to combat any judgment\r\nunfavourable to himself. Never weary of argument, he thought that by its\r\nmeans, conducted on lines of reason, all questions might be finally\r\nsettled, all problems satisfactorily and speedily solved. Hence the\r\nfascination he possessed for those in doubt and distress of mind. Cool\r\nrather than cold-hearted, he had a certain benignity of nature which,\r\njoined to intellectual exaltation, passed as warmth and fervour. His\r\nkindness was very great to young men at the \"storm and stress\" period of\r\ntheir lives. They for their part thought that, as he was delighted to\r\nenter into, discuss and analyse their difficulties, he must, himself, have\r\nfelt all these difficulties and have overcome them; and, whether they\r\nfollowed his proffered advice or not, they never failed to look up to him\r\nas an oracle.\r\n\r\nFriendships Godwin had, but of love he seems to have kept absolutely clear\r\nuntil at the age of forty-three he met Mary Wollstonecraft. He had not\r\nmuch believed in love as a disturbing element, and had openly avowed in\r\nhis writings that he thought it usurped far too large a place in the\r\nordinary plan of human life. He did not think it needful to reckon with\r\npassion or emotion as factors in the sum of existence, and in his ideal\r\nprogramme they played no part at all.\r\n\r\nMary Wollstonecraft was in all respects his opposite. Her ardent,\r\nimpulsive, Irish nature had stood the test of an early life of much\r\nunhappiness. Her childhood's home had been a wretched one; suffering and\r\nhardship were her earliest companions. She had had not only to maintain\r\nherself, but to be the support of others weaker than herself, and many of\r\nthese had proved unworthy of her devotion. But her rare nature had risen\r\nsuperior to these trials, which, far from crushing her, elicited her\r\nfinest qualities.\r\n\r\nThe indignation aroused in her by injustice and oppression, her revolt\r\nagainst the consecrated tyranny of conventionality, impelled her to raise\r\nher voice in behalf of the weak and unfortunate. The book which made her\r\nname famous, _A Vindication of the Rights of Women_, won for her then, as\r\nit has done since, an admiration from half of mankind only equalled by the\r\nreprobation of the other half. Yet most of its theories, then considered\r\nso dangerously extreme, would to-day be contested by few, although the\r\nfrankness of expression thought so shocking now attracted no special\r\nnotice then, and indicated no coarseness of feeling, but only the habit of\r\ncalling things by their names.\r\n\r\nIn 1792, desiring to become better acquainted with the French language,\r\nand also to follow on the spot the development of France's efforts in the\r\ncause of freedom, she went to Paris, where, in a short time, owing to the\r\nunforeseen progress of the Revolution, she was virtually imprisoned, in\r\nthe sense of being unable to return to England. Here she met Captain\r\nGilbert Imlay, an American, between whom and herself an attachment sprang\r\nup, and whose wife, in all but the legal and religious ceremony, she\r\nbecame. This step she took in full conscientiousness. Had she married\r\nImlay she must have openly declared her true position as a British\r\nsubject, an act which would have been fraught with the most dangerous,\r\nperhaps fatal consequences to them both. A woman of strong religious\r\nfeeling, she had upheld the sanctity of marriage in her writings, yet not\r\non religious grounds. The heart of marriage, and reason for it, with her,\r\nwas love. She regarded herself as Imlay's lawful wife, and had perfect\r\nfaith in his constancy. It wore out, however, and after causing her much\r\nsuspense, anxiety, and affliction, he finally left her with a little girl\r\nsome eighteen months old. Her grief was excessive, and for a time\r\nthreatened to affect her reason. But her healthy temperament prevailed,\r\nand the powerful tie of maternal love saved her from the consequences of\r\ndespair. It was well for her that she had to work hard at her literary\r\noccupations to support herself and her little daughter.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that she became acquainted with William Godwin.\r\nThey had already met once, before Mary's sojourn in France, but at this\r\nfirst interview neither was impressed by the other. Since her return to\r\nLondon he had shunned her because she was too much talked about in\r\nsociety. Imagining her to be obtrusively \"strong-minded\" and deficient in\r\ndelicacy, he was too strongly prejudiced against her even to read her\r\nbooks. But by degrees he was won over. He saw her warmth of heart, her\r\ngenerous temper, her vigour of intellect; he saw too that she had\r\nsuffered. Such susceptibility as he had was fanned into warmth. His\r\ncritical acumen could not but detect her rare quality and worth, although\r\nthe keen sense of humour and Irish charm which fascinated others may, with\r\nhim, have told against her for a time. But the nervous vanity which formed\r\nhis closest link with ordinary human nature must have been flattered by\r\nthe growing preference of one so widely admired, and whom he discovered to\r\nbe even more deserving of admiration and esteem than the world knew. As to\r\nher, accustomed as she was to homage, she may have felt that for the first\r\ntime she was justly appreciated, and to her wounded and smarting\r\nsusceptibilities this balm of appreciation must have been immeasurable.\r\nHer first freshness of feeling had been wasted on a love which proved to\r\nhave been one-sided and which had recoiled on itself. To love and be\r\nloved again was the beginning of a new life for her. And so it came about\r\nthat the coldest of men and the warmest of women found their happiness in\r\neach other. Thus drawn together, the discipline afforded to her nature by\r\nthe rudest realities of life, to his by the severities of study, had been\r\nsuch as to promise a growing and a lasting companionship and affection.\r\n\r\nIn the short memoir of his wife, prefixed by Godwin to his published\r\ncollection of her letters, he has given his own account, a touching one,\r\nof the growth and recognition of their love.\r\n\r\n    The partiality we conceived for each other was in that mode which I\r\n    have always considered as the purest and most refined style of love.\r\n    It would have been impossible for the most minute observer to have\r\n    said who was before and who was after. One sex did not take the\r\n    priority which long-established custom has awarded it, nor the other\r\n    overstep that delicacy which is so severely imposed. I am not\r\n    conscious that either party can assume to have the agent or the\r\n    patient, the toil spreader or the prey, in the affair. When in the\r\n    course of things the disclosure came, there was nothing in a manner\r\n    for either party to disclose to the other....\r\n\r\n    There was no period of throes and resolute explanation attendant on\r\n    the tale. It was friendship melting into love.\r\n\r\nThey did not, however, marry at once. Godwin's opinion of marriage, looked\r\non as indissoluble, was that it was \"a law, and the worst of all laws.\" In\r\naccordance with this view, the ceremony did not take place till their\r\nunion had lasted some months, and when it did, it was regarded by Godwin\r\nin the light of a distinct concession. He expresses himself most\r\ndecisively on this point in a letter to his friend, Mr. Wedgwood of\r\nEtruria (printed by Mr. Kegan Paul in his memoirs of Godwin), announcing\r\nhis marriage, which had actually taken place a month before, but had been\r\nkept secret.\r\n\r\n    Some persons have found an inconsistency between my practice in this\r\n    instance and my doctrines. But I cannot see it. The doctrine of my\r\n    _Political Justice_ is, that an attachment in some degree permanent\r\n    between two persons of opposite sexes is right, but that marriage, as\r\n    practised in European countries, is wrong. I still adhere to that\r\n    opinion. Nothing but a regard for the happiness of the individual,\r\n    which I have no right to ignore, could have induced me to submit to an\r\n    institution which I wish to see abolished, and which I would recommend\r\n    to my fellow-men never to practise but with the greatest caution.\r\n    Having done what I thought was necessary for the peace and\r\n    respectability of the individual, I hold myself no otherwise bound\r\n    than I was before the ceremony took place.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that he did not repent his concession. But their wedded\r\nhappiness was of short duration. On 30th August 1797 a little girl was\r\nborn to them.\r\n\r\nAll seemed well at first with the mother. But during the night which\r\nfollowed alarming symptoms made their appearance. For a time it was hoped\r\nthat these had been overcome, and a deceptive rally of two days set\r\nGodwin free from anxiety. But a change for the worst supervened, and after\r\nfour days of intense suffering, sweetly and patiently borne, Mary died,\r\nand Godwin was again alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nAUGUST 1797-JUNE 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nAlone, in the sense of absence of companionship, but not alone in the\r\nsense that he was before, for, when he lost his wife, two helpless little\r\ngirl-lives were left dependent on him. One was Fanny, Mary\r\nWollstonecraft's child by Imlay, now three and a half years old; the other\r\nthe newly-born baby, named after her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, and the\r\nsubject of this memoir.\r\n\r\nThe tenderness of her mother's warm heart, her father's ripe wisdom, the\r\nrich inheritance of intellect and genius which was her birthright, all\r\nthese seemed to promise her the happiest of childhoods. But these bright\r\nprospects were clouded within a few hours of her birth by that change in\r\nher mother's condition which, ten days later, ended in death.\r\n\r\nThe little infant was left to the care of a father of much theoretic\r\nwisdom but profound practical ignorance, so confirmed in his old bachelor\r\nways by years and habit that, even when love so far conquered him as to\r\nmake him quit the single state, he declined family life, and carried on a\r\ndouble existence, taking rooms a few doors from his wife's home, and\r\ncombining the joys--as yet none of the cares--of matrimony with the\r\nindependence, and as much as possible of the irresponsibility, of\r\nbachelorhood. Godwin's sympathies with childhood had been first elicited\r\nby his intercourse with little Fanny Imlay, whom, from the time of his\r\nunion, he treated as his own daughter, and to whom he was unvaryingly kind\r\nand indulgent.\r\n\r\nHe moved at once after his wife's death into the house, Polygon, Somers\r\nTown, where she had lived, and took up his abode there with the two\r\nchildren. They had a nurse, and various lady friends of the Godwins, Mrs.\r\nReveley and others, gave occasional assistance or superintendence. An\r\nexperiment was tried of a lady-housekeeper which, however, failed, as the\r\nlady in becoming devoted to the children showed a disposition to become\r\ndevoted to Godwin also, construing civilities into marked attentions,\r\nresenting fancied slights, and becoming at last an insupportable thorn in\r\nthe poor philosopher's side. His letters speak of his despondency and\r\nfeeling of unfitness to have the care of these young creatures devolved on\r\nhim, and with this sense there came also the renewed perception of the\r\nrare maternal qualities of the wife he had lost.\r\n\r\n    \"The poor children!\" he wrote, six weeks after his bereavement. \"I am\r\n    myself totally unfitted to educate them. The scepticism which perhaps\r\n    sometimes leads me right in matters of speculation is torment to me\r\n    when I would attempt to direct the infant mind. I am the most unfit\r\n    person for this office; she was the best qualified in the world. What\r\n    a change! The loss of the children is less remediless than mine. You\r\n    can understand the difference.\"\r\n\r\nThe immediate consequence of this was that he, who had passed so many\r\nyears in contented bachelorhood, made, within a short time, repeated\r\nproposals of marriage to different ladies, some of them urged with a\r\npertinacity nothing short of ludicrous, so ingenuously and argumentatively\r\nplain does he make it that he found it simply incredible any woman should\r\nrefuse him to whom he had condescended to propose. His former objections\r\nto marriage are never now alluded to and seem relegated to the category of\r\nobsolete theories. Nothing testifies so strongly to his married happiness\r\nas his constant efforts to recover any part of it, and his faith in the\r\npossibility of doing so. In 1798 he proposed again and again to a Miss Lee\r\nwhom he had not seen half a dozen times. In 1799 he importuned the\r\nbeautiful Mrs. Reveley, who had, herself, only been a widow for a month,\r\nto marry him. He was really attached to her, and was much wounded when,\r\nnot long after, she married a Mr. Gisborne.\r\n\r\nDuring Godwin's preoccupations and occasional absences, the kindest and\r\nmost faithful friend the children had was James Marshall, who acted as\r\nGodwin's amanuensis, and was devotedly attached to him and all who\r\nbelonged to him.\r\n\r\nIn 1801 Godwin married a Mrs. Clairmont, his next-door neighbour, a widow\r\nwith a son, Charles, about Fanny's age, and a daughter, Jane, somewhat\r\nyounger than little Mary. The new Mrs. Godwin was a clever, bustling,\r\nsecond-rate woman, glib of tongue and pen, with a temper undisciplined and\r\nuncontrolled; not bad-hearted, but with a complete absence of all the\r\nfiner sensibilities; possessing a fund of what is called \"knowledge of the\r\nworld,\" and a plucky, enterprising, happy-go-lucky disposition, which\r\nseemed to the philosophic and unpractical Godwin, in its way, a\r\nmanifestation of genius. Besides, she was clever enough to admire Godwin,\r\nand frank enough to tell him so, points which must have been greatly in\r\nher favour.\r\n\r\nAlthough her father's remarriage proved a source of lifelong unhappiness\r\nto Mary, it may not have been a bad thing for her and Fanny at the time.\r\nInstead of being left to the care of servants, with the occasional\r\nsupervision of chance friends, they were looked after with solicitous, if\r\nnot always the most judicious care. The three little girls were near\r\nenough of an age to be companions to each other, but Fanny was the senior\r\nby three years and a half. She bore Godwin's name, and was considered and\r\ntreated as the eldest daughter of the house.\r\n\r\nGodwin's worldly circumstances were at all times most precarious, nor had\r\nhe the capability or force of will to establish them permanently on a\r\nbetter footing. His earnings from his literary works were always\r\nforestalled long before they were due, and he was in the constant habit of\r\napplying to his friends for loans or advances of money which often could\r\nonly be repaid by similar aid from some other quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the hope of mending their fortunes a little, Mrs. Godwin, in 1805,\r\ninduced her husband to make a venture as a publisher. He set up a small\r\nplace of business in Hanway Street, in the name of his foreman, Baldwin,\r\ndeeming that his own name might operate prejudicially with the public on\r\naccount of his advanced political and social opinions, and also that his\r\nown standing in the literary world might suffer did it become known that\r\nhe was connected with trade.\r\n\r\nMrs. Godwin was the chief practical manager in this business, which\r\nfinally involved her husband in ruin, but for a time promised well enough.\r\nThe chief feature in the enterprise was a \"Magazine of Books for the use\r\nand amusement of children,\" published by Godwin under the name of Baldwin;\r\nbooks of history, mythology, and fable, all admirably written for their\r\nspecial purpose. He used to test his juvenile works by reading them to\r\nhis children and observing the effect. Their remark would be (so he says),\r\n\"How easy this is! Why, we learn it by heart almost as fast as we read\r\nit.\" \"Their suffrage,\" he adds, \"gave me courage, and I carried on my work\r\nto the end.\" Mrs. Godwin translated, for the business, several childrens'\r\nbooks from the French. Among other works specially written, Lamb's _Tales\r\nfrom Shakespeare_ owes its existence to \"M. J. Godwin & Co.,\" the name\r\nunder which the firm was finally established.\r\n\r\nNew and larger premises were taken in Skinner Street, Holborn, and in the\r\nautumn of 1807 the whole family, which now included five young ones, of\r\nwhom Charles Clairmont was the eldest, and William, the son of Godwin and\r\nhis second wife, the youngest, removed to a house next door to the\r\npublishing office. Here they remained until 1822.\r\n\r\nNo continuous record exists of the family life, and the numerous letters\r\nof Godwin and Mrs. Godwin when either was absent from home contain only\r\noccasional references to it. Both parents were too much occupied with\r\nbusiness systematically to superintend the children's education. Mrs.\r\nGodwin, however, seems to have taken a bustling interest in ordering it,\r\nand scrupulously refers to Godwin all points of doubt or discussion. From\r\nhis letters one would judge that, while he gave due attention to each\r\npoint, discussing _pros_ and _cons_ with his deliberate impartiality, his\r\nwife practically decided everything. Although they sometimes quarrelled\r\n(on one occasion to the extent of seriously proposing to separate) they\r\nalways made it up again, nor is there any sign that on the subject of the\r\nchildren's training they ever had any real difference of opinion. Mrs.\r\nGodwin's jealous fussiness gave Godwin abundant opportunities for the\r\nexercise of philosophy, and to the inherent untruthfulness of her manner\r\nand speech he remained strangely and philosophically blind. From allusions\r\nin letters we gather that the children had a daily governess, with\r\noccasional lessons from a master, Mr. Burton. It is often asserted that\r\nMrs. Godwin was a harsh and cruel stepmother, who made the children's home\r\nmiserable. There is nothing to prove this. Later on, when moral guidance\r\nand sympathy were needed, she fell short indeed of what she might have\r\nbeen. But for the material wellbeing of the children she cared well\r\nenough, and was at any rate desirous that they should be happy, whether or\r\nnot she always took the best means of making them so. And Godwin placed\r\nfull confidence in her practical powers.\r\n\r\nIn May 1811 Mrs. Godwin and all the children except Fanny, who stayed at\r\nhome to keep house for Godwin, went for sea-bathing to Margate, moving\r\nafterwards to Ramsgate. This had been urged by Mr. Cline, the family\r\ndoctor, for the good of little Mary, who, during some years of her\r\notherwise healthy girlhood, suffered from a weakness in one arm. They\r\nboarded at the house of a Miss Petman, who kept a ladies' school, but had\r\ntheir sleeping apartments at an inn or other lodging. Mary, however, was\r\nsent to stay altogether at Miss Petman's, in order to be quiet, and in\r\nparticular to be out of the way of little William, \"he made so boisterous\r\na noise when going to bed at night.\"\r\n\r\nThe sea-breezes soon worked the desired effect. \"Mary's arm is better,\"\r\nwrites Mrs. Godwin on the 10th of June. \"She begins to move and use it.\"\r\nSo marked and rapid was the improvement that Mrs. Godwin thought it would\r\nbe as well to leave her behind for a longer stay when the rest returned to\r\ntown, and wrote to consult Godwin about it. His answer is characteristic.\r\n\r\n    When I do not answer any of the lesser points in your letters, it is\r\n    because I fully agree with you, and therefore do not think it\r\n    necessary to draw out an answer point by point, but am content to\r\n    assent by silence.... This was the case as to Mary's being left in the\r\n    care of Miss Petman. It was recommended by Mr. Cline from the first\r\n    that she should stay six months; to this recommendation we both\r\n    assented. It shall be so, if it can, and undoubtedly I conceived you,\r\n    on the spot, most competent to select the residence.\r\n\r\nMary accordingly remained at Miss Petman's as a boarder, perhaps as a\r\npupil also, till 19th December, when, from her father's laconic but minute\r\nand scrupulously accurate diary, we learn that she returned home. For the\r\nnext five months she was in Skinner Street, participating in its busy,\r\nirregular family life, its ups and downs, its anxieties, discomforts, and\r\namusements, its keen intellectual activity and lively interest in social\r\nand literary matters, in all of which the young people took their full\r\nshare. Entries are frequent in Godwin's diary of visits to the theatre, of\r\ntea-drinkings, of guests of all sorts at home. One of these guests affords\r\nus, in his journal, some agreeable glimpses into the Godwin household.\r\n\r\nThis was the celebrated Aaron Burr, sometime Vice-President of the United\r\nStates, now an exile and a wanderer in Europe.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his election he had got into disgrace with his party, and,\r\nwhen nominated for the Governorship of New York, he had been opposed and\r\ndefeated by his former allies. The bitter contest led to a duel between\r\nhim and Alexander Hamilton, in which the latter was killed. Disfranchised\r\nby the laws of New York for having fought a duel, and indicted (though\r\nacquitted) for murder in New Jersey, Burr set out on a journey through the\r\nWestern States, nourishing schemes of sedition and revenge. When he\r\npurchased 400,000 acres of land on the Red River, and gave his adherents\r\nto understand that the Spanish Dominions were to be conquered, his\r\nproceedings excited alarm. President Jefferson issued a proclamation\r\nagainst him, and he was arrested on a charge of high treason. Nothing\r\ncould, however, be positively proved, and after a six months' trial he was\r\nliberated. He at once started for Europe, having planned an attack on\r\nMexico, for which he hoped to get funds and adherents. He was\r\ndisappointed, and during the four years which he passed in Europe he often\r\nlived in the greatest poverty.\r\n\r\nOn his first visit to England, in 1808, Burr met Godwin only once, but the\r\nentry in his journal, besides bearing indirect witness to the great\r\ncelebrity of Mary Wollstonecraft in America, gives an idea of the kind of\r\nimpression made on a stranger by the second Mrs. Godwin.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen the two daughters of Mary Wollstonecraft,\" he writes. \"They\r\nare very fine children (the eldest no longer a child, being now fifteen),\r\nbut scarcely a discernible trace of the mother. Now Godwin has been seven\r\nor eight years married to a second wife, a sensible, amiable woman.\"\r\n\r\nFor the next four years Burr was a wanderer in Holland and France. His\r\njournal, kept for the benefit of his daughter Theodosia, to whom he also\r\naddressed a number of letters, is full of strange and stirring interest.\r\nIn 1812 he came back to England, where it was not long before he drifted\r\nto Godwin's door. Burr's character was licentious and unscrupulous, but\r\nhis appearance and manners were highly prepossessing; he made friends\r\nwherever he went. The Godwin household was full of hospitality for such\r\nBohemian wanderers as he. Always itself in a precarious state of fortune,\r\nit held out the hand of fellowship to others whose existence from day to\r\nday was uncertain. A man of brains and ideas, of congenial and lively\r\ntemperament, was sure of a fraternal welcome. And though many of Godwin's\r\nolder friends were, in time, estranged from him through their antipathy to\r\nhis wife, she was full of patronising good-nature for a man like Burr, who\r\nwell knew how to ingratiate himself.\r\n\r\n    _Burr's Journal, February 15, 1812._--Had only time to get to\r\n    Godwin's, where we dined. In the evening William, the only son of\r\n    William Godwin, a lad of about nine years old, gave his weekly\r\n    lecture: having heard how Coleridge and others lectured, he would also\r\n    lecture, and one of his sisters (Mary, I think) writes a lecture which\r\n    he reads from a little pulpit which they have erected for him. He went\r\n    through it with great gravity and decorum. The subject was \"The\r\n    influence of government on the character of a people.\" After the\r\n    lecture we had tea, and the girls danced and sang an hour, and at nine\r\n    came home.\r\n\r\nNothing can give a pleasanter picture of the family, the lively-minded\r\nchildren keenly interested in all the subjects and ideas they heard\r\nfreely discussed around them; the elders taking pleasure in encouraging\r\nthe children's first essays of intellect; Mary at fourteen already showing\r\nher powers of thought and inborn vocation to write, and supplying her\r\nlittle brother with ideas. The reverse of the medal appears in the next\r\nentry, for the genial unconventional household was generally on the verge\r\nof ruin, and dependent on some expected loan for subsistence in the next\r\nfew months. When once the sought-for assistance came they revelled in\r\nmomentary relief from care.\r\n\r\n    _Journal, February 18._--Have gone this evening to Godwin's. They are\r\n    in trouble. Some financial affair.\r\n\r\nIt did not weigh long on their spirits.\r\n\r\n    _February 24._--Called at Godwin's to leave the newspapers which I\r\n    borrowed yesterday, and to get that of to-day. _Les goddesses_ (so he\r\n    habitually designates the three girls) kept me by acclamation to tea\r\n    with _la printresse_ Hopwood. I agreed to go with the girls to call on\r\n    her on Friday.\r\n\r\n    _February 28._--Was engaged to dine to-day at Godwin's, and to walk\r\n    with the four dames. After dinner to the Hopwoods. All which was done.\r\n\r\n    _March 7._--To Godwin's, where I took tea with the children in their\r\n    room.\r\n\r\n    _March 14._--To Godwin's. He was out. Madame and _les enfans_ upstairs\r\n    in the bedroom, where they received me, and I drank tea with his\r\n    _enfans_.... Terribly afraid of vigils to-night, for Jane made my tea,\r\n    and, I fear, too strong. It is only Fan that I can trust.\r\n\r\n    _March 17._--To Godwin's, where took tea with the children, who always\r\n    have it at 9. Mr. and Madame at 7.\r\n\r\n    _March 22._--On to Godwin's; found him at breakfast and joined him.\r\n    Madame a-bed.\r\n\r\n    _Later._--Mr. and Mrs. Godwin would not give me their account, which\r\n    must be five or six pounds, a very serious sum for them. They say that\r\n    when I succeed in the world they will call on me for help.\r\n\r\nThis probably means that the Godwins had lent him money. He was well-nigh\r\npenniless, and Mrs. Godwin exerted herself to get resources for him, to\r\nsell one or two books of value which he had, and to get a good price for\r\nhis watch. She knew a good deal of the makeshifts of poverty, and none of\r\nthe family seemed to have grudged time or trouble if they could do a good\r\nturn to this companion in difficulties. It is a question whether, when\r\nthey talked of his succeeding in the world, they were aware of the\r\nparticular form of success for which he was scheming; in any case they\r\nseem to have been content to take him as they found him. They were the\r\nlast friends from whom he parted on the eve of sailing for America. His\r\nentry just before starting is--\r\n\r\n    Called and passed an hour with the Godwins. That family does really\r\n    love me. Fanny, Mary, and Jane, also little William: you must not\r\n    forget, either, Hannah Hopwood, _la printresse_.\r\n\r\nThese few months were, very likely, the brightest which Mary ever passed\r\nat home. Her rapidly growing powers of mind and observation were nourished\r\nand developed by the stimulating intellectual atmosphere around her; to\r\nthe anxieties and uncertainties which, like birds of ill-omen, hovered\r\nover the household and were never absent for long together, she was well\r\naccustomed, besides which she was still too young to be much affected by\r\nthem. She was fond of her sisters, and devoted to her father. Mrs.\r\nGodwin's temperament can never have been congenial to hers, but occasions\r\nof collision do not appear to have been frequent, and Fanny, devoted and\r\nunselfish, only anxious for others to be happy and ready herself to serve\r\nany of them, was the link between them all. Mary's health was, however,\r\nnot yet satisfactory, and before the summer an opportunity which offered\r\nitself of change of air was willingly accepted on her behalf by Mr. and\r\nMrs. Godwin. In 1809 Godwin had made the acquaintance of Mr. William\r\nBaxter of Dundee, on the introduction of Mr. David Booth, who afterwards\r\nbecame Baxter's son-in-law. Baxter, a man of liberal mind, independence of\r\nthought and action, and kindly nature, shared to the full the respect\r\nentertained by most thinking men of that generation for the author of\r\n_Political Justice_. Godwin, always accessible to sympathetic strangers,\r\nwas at once pleased with this new acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you,\" he wrote to Booth, \"for your introduction of Mr. Baxter. I\r\ndare swear he is an honest man, and he is no fool.\" During Baxter's\r\nseveral visits to London they became better acquainted. Charles Clairmont\r\ntoo, went to Edinburgh in 1811, as a clerk in Constable's printing office,\r\nwhere he met and made friends with Baxter's son Robert, who, as well as\r\nhis father, visited the Skinner Street household in London, and through\r\nwhom the intimacy was cemented. In this way it was that Mary was invited\r\nto come on a long visit to the Baxters at their house, \"The Cottage,\" on\r\nthe banks of the Tay, just outside Dundee, on the road to Broughty Ferry.\r\nThe family included several girls, near Mary's own age, and with true\r\nScotch hospitality they pressed her to make one of their family circle for\r\nan indefinite length of time, until sea-air and sea-bathing should have\r\ncompleted the recovery begun the year before at Ramsgate, but which could\r\nnot be maintained in the smoky air and indoor life of London. Accordingly,\r\nMary sailed for Dundee on the 8th of June 1812.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nJUNE 1812-MAY 1814\r\n\r\n\r\n    GODWIN TO BAXTER.\r\n\r\n    SKINNER STREET, LONDON.\r\n    _8th June 1812._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR--I have shipped off to you by yesterday's packet, the\r\n    _Osnaburgh_, Captain Wishart, my only daughter. I attended her, with\r\n    her two sisters, to the wharf, and remained an hour on board, till the\r\n    vessel got under way. I cannot help feeling a thousand anxieties in\r\n    parting with her, for the first time, for so great a distance, and\r\n    these anxieties were increased by the manner of sending her, on board\r\n    a ship, with not a single face around her that she had ever seen till\r\n    that morning. She is four months short of fifteen years of age. I,\r\n    however, spoke to the captain, using your name; I beside gave her in\r\n    charge to a lady, by name I believe Mrs. Nelson, of Great St. Helen's,\r\n    London, who was going to your part of the island in attendance upon an\r\n    invalid husband. She was surrounded by three daughters when I spoke to\r\n    her, and she answered me very agreeably. \"I shall have none of my own\r\n    daughters with me, and shall therefore have the more leisure to attend\r\n    to yours.\"\r\n\r\n    I daresay she will arrive more dead than alive, as she is extremely\r\n    subject to sea-sickness, and the voyage will, not improbably, last\r\n    nearly a week. Mr. Cline, the surgeon, however, decides that a\r\n    sea-voyage would probably be of more service to her than anything.\r\n\r\n    I am quite confounded to think what trouble I am bringing on you and\r\n    your family, and to what a degree I may be said to have taken you in\r\n    when I took you at your word in your invitation upon so slight an\r\n    acquaintance. The old proverb says, \"He is a wise father who knows his\r\n    own child,\" and I feel the justness of the apothegm on the present\r\n    occasion.\r\n\r\n    There never can be a perfect equality between father and child, and if\r\n    he has other objects and avocations to fill up the greater part of his\r\n    time, the ordinary resource is for him to proclaim his wishes and\r\n    commands in a way somewhat sententious and authoritative, and\r\n    occasionally to utter his censures with seriousness and emphasis.\r\n\r\n    It can, therefore, seldom happen that he is the confidant of his\r\n    child, or that the child does not feel some degree of awe or restraint\r\n    in intercourse with him. I am not, therefore, a perfect judge of\r\n    Mary's character. I believe she has nothing of what is commonly called\r\n    vices, and that she has considerable talent. But I tremble for the\r\n    trouble I may be bringing on you in this visit. In my last I desired\r\n    that you would consider the first two or three weeks as a trial, how\r\n    far you can ensure her, or, more fairly and impartially speaking, how\r\n    far her habits and conceptions may be such as to put your family very\r\n    unreasonably out of their way; and I expect from the frankness and\r\n    ingenuousness of yours of the 29th inst. (which by the way was so\r\n    ingenuous as to come without a seal) that you will not for a moment\r\n    hesitate to inform me if such should be the case. When I say all this,\r\n    I hope you will be aware that I do not desire that she should be\r\n    treated with extraordinary attention, or that any one of your family\r\n    should put themselves in the smallest degree out of their way on her\r\n    account. I am anxious that she should be brought up (in this respect)\r\n    like a philosopher, even like a cynic. It will add greatly to the\r\n    strength and worth of her character. I should also observe that she\r\n    has no love of dissipation, and will be perfectly satisfied with your\r\n    woods and your mountains. I wish, too, that she should be _excited_\r\n    to industry. She has occasionally great perseverance, but\r\n    occasionally, too, she shows great need to be roused.\r\n\r\n    You are aware that she comes to the sea-side for the purpose of\r\n    bathing. I should wish that you would inquire now and then into the\r\n    regularity of that. She will want also some treatment for her arm, but\r\n    she has Mr. Cline's directions completely in all these points, and\r\n    will probably not require a professional man to look after her while\r\n    she is with you. In all other respects except her arm she has\r\n    admirable health, has an excellent appetite, and is capable of\r\n    enduring fatigue. Mrs. Godwin reminds me that I ought to have said\r\n    something about troubling your daughters to procure a washerwoman. But\r\n    I trust that, without its being necessary to be thus minute, you will\r\n    proceed on the basis of our being earnest to give you as little\r\n    trouble as the nature of the case will allow.--I am, my dear sir, with\r\n    great regard, yours,\r\n\r\n      WILLIAM GODWIN.\r\n\r\nAt Dundee, with the Baxters, Mary remained for five months. She was\r\ntreated as a sister by the Baxter girls, one of whom, Isabella, afterwards\r\nthe wife of David Booth, became her most intimate friend. An elder sister,\r\nMiss Christian Baxter, to whom the present writer is indebted for a few\r\npersonal reminiscences of Mary Godwin, only died in 1886, and was probably\r\nthe last survivor of those who remembered Mary in her girlhood. They were\r\nall fond of their new companion. She was agreeable, vivacious, and\r\nsparkling; very pretty, with fair hair and complexion, and clear, bright\r\nwhite skin. The Baxters were people of education and culture, active\r\nminded, fond of reading, and alive to external impressions. The young\r\npeople were well and carefully brought up. Mary shared in all their\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\nMusic they did not care for, but all were fond of drawing and painting,\r\nand had good lessons. A great deal of time was spent in touring about, in\r\nlong walks and drives through the moors and mountains of Forfarshire. They\r\ntook pains to make Mary acquainted with all the country round, besides\r\nwhich it was laid on her as a duty to get as much fresh air as she could,\r\nand she must greatly have enjoyed the well-ordered yet easy life, the\r\ncomplete change of scene and companionship. When, on the 10th of November,\r\nshe arrived again in Skinner Street, she brought Christy Baxter with her,\r\nfor a long return visit to London. If Mary had enjoyed her country outing,\r\nstill more keenly did the homely Scotch girl relish her first taste of\r\nLondon life and society. At ninety-two years old the impression of her\r\npleasure in it, of her interest in all the notable people with whom she\r\ncame in contact, was as vivid as ever.\r\n\r\nThe literary and artistic circle which still hung about the Skinner Street\r\nphilosophers was to Christy a new world, of which, except from books, she\r\nhad formed no idea. Books, however, had laid the foundation of keenest\r\ninterest in all she was to see. She was constantly in company with Lamb,\r\nHazlitt, Coleridge, Constable, and many more, hitherto known to her only\r\nby name. Of Charles Lamb especially, of his wit, humour, and quaintness\r\nshe retained the liveliest recollection, and he had evidently a great\r\nliking for her, referring jokingly to her in his letters as \"Doctor\r\nChristy,\" and often inviting her, with the Godwin family, to tea, to meet\r\nher relatives, when up in town, or other friends.\r\n\r\nOn 11th November, the very day after the two girls arrived in London, a\r\nmeeting occurred of no special interest to Christy at the time, and which\r\nshe would have soon forgotten but for subsequent events. Three guests came\r\nto dinner at Godwin's. These were Percy Bysshe Shelley with his wife\r\nHarriet, and her sister, Eliza Westbrook. Christy Baxter well remembered\r\nthis, but her chief recollection was of Harriet, her beauty, her brilliant\r\ncomplexion and lovely hair, and the elegance of her purple satin dress. Of\r\nShelley, how he looked, what he said or did, what they all thought of him,\r\nshe had observed nothing, except that he was very attentive to Harriet.\r\nThe meeting was of no apparent significance and passed without remark:\r\nlittle indeed did any one foresee the drama soon to follow. Plenty of more\r\nimportant days, more interesting meetings to Christy, followed during the\r\nnext few months. She shared Mary's room during this time, but her memory,\r\nin old age, afforded few details of their everyday intercourse. Indeed,\r\nalthough they spent so much time together, these two were never very\r\nintimate. Isabella Baxter, afterwards Mrs. Booth, was Mary's especial\r\nfriend and chief correspondent, and it is much to be regretted that none\r\nof their girlish letters have been preserved.\r\n\r\nThe four girls had plenty of liberty, and, what with reading and talk,\r\nwith constantly varied society enjoyed in the intimate unconstrained way\r\nof those who cannot afford the _appareil_ of convention, with tolerably\r\nfrequent visits at friends' houses and not seldom to the theatre, when\r\nGodwin, as often happened, got a box sent him, they had plenty of\r\namusement too. Godwin's diary keeps a wonderfully minute skeleton account\r\nof all their doings. Christy enjoyed it all as only a novice can do. All\r\nher recollections of the family life were agreeable; if anything had left\r\nan unpleasing impression it had faded away in 1883, when the present\r\nwriter saw her. For Godwin she entertained a warm respect and affection.\r\nThey did not see very much of him, but Christy was a favourite of his, and\r\nhe would sometimes take a quiet pleasure, not unmixed with amusement, in\r\nlistening to their girlish talks and arguments. One such discussion she\r\ndistinctly remembered, on the subject of woman's vocation, as to whether\r\nit should be purely domestic, or whether they should engage in outside\r\ninterests. Mary and Jane upheld the latter view, Fanny and Christy the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nMrs. Godwin was kind to Christy, who always saw her best side, and never\r\nwould hear a word said against her. Her deficiencies were not palpable to\r\nan outsider whom she liked and chose to patronise, nor did Christy appear\r\nto have felt the inherent untruthfulness in Mrs. Godwin's character,\r\nalthough one famous instance of it was recorded by Isabella Baxter, and is\r\ngiven at length in Mr. Kegan Paul's _Life of Godwin_.\r\n\r\nThe various members of the family had more independence of habits than is\r\ncommon in English domestic life. This was perhaps a relic of Godwin's old\r\nidea, that much evil and weariness resulted from the supposed necessity\r\nthat the members of a family should spend all or most of their time in\r\neach other's company. He always breakfasted alone. Mrs. Godwin did so\r\nalso, and not till mid-day. The young folks had theirs together. Dinner\r\nwas a family meal, but supper seems to have been a movable feast. Jane\r\nClairmont, of whose education not much is known beyond the fact that she\r\nwas sometimes at school, was at home for a part if not all of this time.\r\nShe was lively and quick-witted, and probably rather unmanageable. Fanny\r\nwas more reflective, less sanguine, more alive to the prosaic obligations\r\nof life, and with a keen sense of domestic duty, early developed in her by\r\nnecessity and by her position as the eldest of this somewhat anomalous\r\nfamily. Godwin, by nature as undemonstrative as possible, showed more\r\naffection to Fanny than to any one else. He always turned to her for any\r\nlittle service he might require. It seemed, said Christy, as though he\r\nwould fain have guarded against the possibility of her feeling that she,\r\nan orphan, was less to him than the others. Christy was of opinion that\r\nFanny was not made aware of her real position till her quite later years,\r\na fact which, if true, goes far towards explaining much of her after life.\r\nIt seems most likely, at any rate, that at this time she was unacquainted\r\nwith the circumstances of her birth. To Godwin she had always seemed like\r\nhis own eldest child, the first he had cared for or who had been fond of\r\nhim, and his dependence on her was not surprising, for no daughter could\r\nhave tended him with more solicitous care; besides which, she was one of\r\nthose people, ready to do anything for everybody, who are always at the\r\nbeck and call of others, and always in request. She filled the home, to\r\nwhich Mary, so constantly absent, was just now only a visitor.\r\n\r\nIt must have been at about this time that Godwin received a letter from an\r\nunknown correspondent, who expressed much curiosity to know whether his\r\nchildren were brought up in accordance with the ideas, by some considered\r\nso revolutionary and dangerous, of Mary Wollstonecraft, and what the\r\nresult was of reducing her theories to actual practice. Godwin's answer,\r\ngiving his own description of her two daughters, has often been printed,\r\nbut it is worth giving here.\r\n\r\n    Your inquiries relate principally to the two daughters of Mary\r\n    Wollstonecraft. They are neither of them brought up with an exclusive\r\n    attention to the system of their mother. I lost her in 1797, and in\r\n    1801 I married a second time. One among the motives which led me to\r\n    choose this was the feeling I had in myself of an incompetence for the\r\n    education of daughters. The present Mrs. Godwin has great strength and\r\n    activity of mind, but is not exclusively a follower of their mother;\r\n    and indeed, having formed a family establishment without having a\r\n    previous provision for the support of a family, neither Mrs. Godwin\r\n    nor I have leisure enough for reducing novel theories of education to\r\n    practice, while we both of us honestly endeavour, as far as our\r\n    opportunities will permit, to improve the minds and characters of the\r\n    younger branches of the family.\r\n\r\n    Of the two persons to whom your inquiries relate, my own daughter is\r\n    considerably superior in capacity to the one her mother had before.\r\n    Fanny, the eldest, is of a quiet, modest, unshowy disposition,\r\n    somewhat given to indolence, which is her greatest fault, but sober,\r\n    observing, peculiarly clear and distinct in the faculty of memory, and\r\n    disposed to exercise her own thoughts and follow her own judgment.\r\n    Mary, my daughter, is the reverse of her in many particulars. She is\r\n    singularly bold, somewhat imperious, and active of mind. Her desire\r\n    of knowledge is great, and her perseverance in everything she\r\n    undertakes almost invincible. My own daughter is, I believe, very\r\n    pretty. Fanny is by no means handsome, but, in general, prepossessing.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of June Mary accompanied Christy back to Dundee, where she\r\nremained for the next ten months.\r\n\r\nNo account remains of her life there, but there can be doubt that her\r\nmental and intellectual powers matured rapidly, and that she learned,\r\nread, and thought far more than is common even with clever girls of her\r\nage. The girl who at seventeen is an intellectual companion for a Shelley\r\ncannot often have needed to be \"excited to industry,\" unless indeed when\r\nshe indulged in day-dreams, as, from her own account given in the preface\r\nto her novel of _Frankenstein_, we know she sometimes did. Proud of her\r\nparentage, idolising the memory of her mother, about whom she gathered and\r\ntreasured every scrap of information she could obtain, and of whose\r\nhistory and writings she probably now learned more than she had done at\r\nhome, accustomed from her childhood to the daily society of authors and\r\nliterary men, the pen was her earliest toy, and now the attempt at\r\noriginal composition was her chosen occupation.\r\n\r\n    \"As a child,\" she says, \"I scribbled; and my favourite pastime, during\r\n    the hours given me for recreation, was to 'write stories.' Still I had\r\n    a dearer pleasure than this, which was the formation of castles in\r\n    the air,--the indulging in waking dreams,--the following up trains of\r\n    thought which had for their subject the formation of a succession of\r\n    imaginary incidents. My dreams were at once more fantastic and\r\n    agreeable than my writings. In the latter I was a close imitator,\r\n    rather doing as others had done than putting down the suggestions of\r\n    my own mind. What I wrote was intended at least for one other eye--my\r\n    childhood's companion and friend\" (probably Isabel Baxter)--\"but my\r\n    dreams were all my own. I accounted for them to nobody; they were my\r\n    refuge when annoyed, my dearest pleasure when free.\r\n\r\n    \"I lived principally in the country as a girl, and passed a\r\n    considerable time in Scotland. I made occasional visits to the more\r\n    picturesque parts; but my habitual residence was on the blank and\r\n    dreary northern shores of the Tay, near Dundee. Blank and dreary on\r\n    retrospection I call them; they were not so to me then. They were the\r\n    eyry of freedom, and the pleasant region where unheeded I could\r\n    commune with the creatures of my fancy. I wrote then, but in a most\r\n    commonplace style. It was beneath the trees of the grounds belonging\r\n    to our house, or on the bleak sides of the woodless mountains near,\r\n    that my true compositions, the airy flights of my imagination, were\r\n    born and fostered. I did not make myself the heroine of my tales. Life\r\n    appeared to me too commonplace an affair as regarded myself. I could\r\n    not figure to myself that romantic woes or wonderful events would ever\r\n    be my lot; but I was not confined to my own identity, and I could\r\n    people the hours with creations far more interesting to me, at that\r\n    age, than my own sensations.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the entry in Godwin's diary, \"M. W. G. at supper,\" for 30th March\r\n1814, we learn that Mary returned to Skinner Street on that day. She now\r\nresumed her place in the home circle, a very different person from the\r\nlittle Mary who went to Ramsgate in 1811. Although only sixteen and a\r\nhalf she was in the bloom of her girlhood, very pretty, very interesting\r\nin appearance, thoughtful and intelligent beyond her years. She did not\r\nsettle down easily into her old place, and probably only realised\r\ngradually how much she had altered since she last lived at home. Perhaps,\r\ntoo, she saw that home in a new light. After the well-ordered, cheerful\r\nfamily life of the Baxters, the somewhat Bohemianism of Skinner Street may\r\nhave seemed a little strange. A household with a philosopher for one of\r\nits heads, and a fussy, unscrupulous woman of business for the other, may\r\nhave its amusing sides, and we have seen that it had; but it is not\r\nnecessarily comfortable, still less sympathetic to a young and earnest\r\nnature, just awakening to a consciousness of the realities of life, at\r\nthat transition stage when so much is chaotic and confusing to those who\r\nare beginning to think and to feel. One may well imagine that all was not\r\nsmooth for poor Mary. Her stepmother's jarring temperament must have\r\ngrated on her more keenly than ever after her long absence. Years and\r\nanxieties did not improve Mrs. Godwin's temper, nor bring refinement or a\r\nnice sense of honour to a nature singularly deficient in both. Mary must\r\nhave had to take refuge from annoyance in day-dreams pretty frequently,\r\nand this was a sure and constant source of irritation to her stepmother.\r\nJane Clairmont, wilful, rebellious, witty, and probably a good deal\r\nspoilt, whose subsequent conduct shows that she was utterly unamenable to\r\nher mother's authority, was, at first, away at school. Fanny was the good\r\nangel of the house, but her persistent defence of every one attacked, and\r\nher determination to make the best of things and people as they were,\r\nseemed almost irritating to those who were smarting under daily and hourly\r\nlittle grievances. Compliance often looks like cowardice to the young and\r\nbold. Nor did Mary get any help from her father. A little affection and\r\nkindly sympathy from him would have gone a long way with her, for she\r\nloved him dearly. Long afterwards she alluded to his \"calm, silent\r\ndisapproval\" when displeased, and to the bitter remorse and unhappiness it\r\nwould cause her, although unspoken, and only instinctively felt by her.\r\nAll her stepmother's scoldings would have failed to produce a like effect.\r\nBut Godwin, though sincerely solicitous about the children's welfare, was\r\nself-concentrated, and had little real insight into character. Besides, he\r\nwas, as usual, hampered about money matters; and when constant anxiety as\r\nto where to get his next loan was added to the preoccupation of\r\nauthorship, and the unavoidable distraction of such details as reached him\r\nof the publishing business, he had little thought or attention to bestow\r\non the daughter who had arrived at so critical a time of her mental and\r\nmoral history. He welcomed her home, but then took little more notice of\r\nher. If she and her stepmother disagreed, Godwin, when forced to take part\r\nin the matter, probably found it the best policy to side with his wife.\r\nYet the situation would have been worth his attention. Here was this girl,\r\nMary Wollstonecraft's daughter, who had left home a clever, unformed\r\nchild, who had returned to it a maiden in her bloom, pretty and\r\nattractive, with ardour, ability, and ambition, with conscious powers that\r\nhad not found their right use, with unsatisfied affections seeking an\r\nobject. True, she might in time have found threads to gather up in her own\r\nhome. But she was young, impatient, and unhappy. Mrs. Godwin was\r\nrepellent, uncongenial, and very jealous of her. All that a daughter could\r\ndo for Godwin seemed to be done by Fanny. When Jane came home it was on\r\nher that Mary was chiefly thrown for society. Her lively spirits and quick\r\nwit made her excellent company, and she was ready enough to make the most\r\nof grievances, and to head any revolt. Fanny, far more deserving of\r\nsisterly sympathy and far more in need of it, seemed to belong to the\r\nopposite camp.\r\n\r\nTime, kindly judicious guidance, and sustained effort on her own part\r\nmight have cleared Mary's path and made things straight for her. Her\r\nheart was as sound and true as her intellect, but this critical time was\r\nrendered more dangerous, it may well be, by her knowledge of the existence\r\nof many theories on vexed subjects, making her feel keenly her own\r\ninexperience and want of a guide.\r\n\r\nThe guide she found was one who himself had wandered till now over many\r\nperplexing paths, led by the light of a restless, sleepless genius, and an\r\ninextinguishable yearning to find, to know, to do, to be the best.\r\n\r\nGodwin's diary records on the 5th of May \"Shelley calls.\" As far as can be\r\nknown this was the first occasion since the dinner of the 11th of November\r\n1812, when Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin saw Percy Bysshe Shelley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nAPRIL-JUNE 1814\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough she had seen Shelley only once, Mary had heard a good deal about\r\nhim. More than two years before this time Godwin had received a letter\r\nfrom a stranger, a very young man, desirous of becoming acquainted with\r\nhim. The writer had, it said, been under the impression that the great\r\nphilosopher, the object of his reverential admiration, whom he now\r\naddressed, was one of the mighty dead. That such was not the case he had\r\nnow learned for the first time, and the most ardent wish of his heart was\r\nto be admitted to the privilege of intercourse with one whom he regarded\r\nas \"a luminary too bright for the darkness which surrounds him.\" \"If,\" he\r\nconcluded, \"desire for universal happiness has any claim upon your\r\npreference, that desire I can exhibit.\"\r\n\r\nSuch neophytes never knelt to Godwin in vain. He did not, at first, feel\r\nspecially interested in this one; still, the kindly tone of his reply led\r\nto further correspondence, in the course of which the new disciple, Mr.\r\nPercy Bysshe Shelley, gave Godwin a sketch of the events of his past life.\r\nGodwin learned that his correspondent was the son of a country squire in\r\nSussex, was heir to a baronetcy and a considerable fortune; that he had\r\nbeen expelled from Oxford for publishing, and refusing to deny the\r\nauthorship of, a pamphlet called \"The Necessity of Atheism\"; that his\r\nfather, having no sympathy either with his literary tastes or speculative\r\nviews, and still less with his method of putting the latter in practice,\r\nhad required from him certain concessions and promises which he had\r\ndeclined to make, and so had been cast off by his family, his father\r\nrefusing to communicate with him, except through a solicitor, allowing him\r\na sum barely enough for his own wants, and that professedly to \"prevent\r\nhis cheating strangers.\" That, undeterred by all this, he had, at\r\nnineteen, married a woman three years younger, whose \"pursuits, hopes,\r\nfears, and sorrows\" had been like his own; and that he hoped to devote his\r\nlife and powers to the regeneration of mankind and society.\r\n\r\nThere was something remarkable about these letters, something that bespoke\r\na mind, ill-balanced it might be, but yet of no common order. Whatever the\r\nworth of the writer's opinions, there could be no doubt that he had the\r\ngift of eloquence in their expression. Half interested and half amused,\r\nwith a vague perception of Shelley's genius, and a certain instinctive\r\ndeference of which he could not divest himself towards the heir to L6000 a\r\nyear, Godwin continued the correspondence with a frequency and an\r\nunreserve most flattering to the younger man.\r\n\r\nNot long after this, the disciple announced that he had gone off, with his\r\nwife and her sister, to Ireland, for the avowed purpose of forwarding the\r\nCatholic Emancipation and the Repeal of the Union. His scheme was \"the\r\norganisation of a society whose institution shall serve as a bond to its\r\nmembers for the purposes of virtue, happiness, liberty, and wisdom, by the\r\nmeans of intellectual opposition to grievances.\" He published and\r\ndistributed an \"Address to the Irish People,\" setting before them their\r\ngrievances, their rights, and their duties.\r\n\r\nThis object Godwin regarded as an utter mistake, its practical furtherance\r\nas extremely perilous. Dreading the contagion of excitement, its tendency\r\nto prevent sober judgment and promote precipitate action, he condemned\r\nassociations of men for any public purpose whatever. His calm temperament\r\nwould fain have dissevered impulse and action altogether as cause and\r\neffect, and he had a shrinking, constitutional as well as philosophic,\r\nfrom any tendency to \"strike while the iron is hot.\"\r\n\r\n\"The thing most to be desired,\" he wrote, \"is to keep up the intellectual,\r\nand in some sense the solitary fermentation, and to procrastinate the\r\ncontact and consequent action.\" \"Shelley! you are preparing a scene of\r\nblood,\" was his solemn warning.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been further from Shelley's thoughts than such a scene.\r\nSurprised and disappointed, he ingenuously confessed to Godwin that his\r\nassociation scheme had grown out of notions of political justice, first\r\ngenerated by Godwin's own book on that subject; and the mentor found\r\nhimself in the position of an involuntary illustration of his own theory,\r\nexpressed in the _Enquirer_ (Essay XX), \"It is by no means impossible that\r\nthe books most pernicious in their effects that ever were produced, were\r\nwritten with intentions uncommonly elevated and pure.\"\r\n\r\nShelley, animated by an ardent enthusiasm of humanity, looked to\r\nassociation as likely to spread a contagion indeed, but a contagion of\r\ngood. The revolution he preached was a Millennium.\r\n\r\n    If you are convinced of the truth of your cause, trust wholly to its\r\n    truth; if you are not convinced, give it up. In no case employ\r\n    violence; the way to liberty and happiness is never to transgress the\r\n    rules of virtue and justice.\r\n\r\n    Before anything can be done with effect, habits of sobriety,\r\n    regularity, and thought must be entered into and firmly resolved on.\r\n\r\n    I will repeat, that virtue and wisdom are necessary to true happiness\r\n    and liberty.\r\n\r\n    Before the restraints of government are lessened, it is fit that we\r\n    should lessen the necessity for them. Before government is done away\r\n    with, we must reform ourselves. It is this work which I would\r\n    earnestly recommend to you. O Irishmen, reform yourselves.[1]\r\n\r\nWhatever evil results Godwin may have apprehended from Shelley's\r\nproceedings, these sentiments taken in the abstract could not but enlist\r\nhis sympathies to some extent on behalf of the deluded young optimist, nor\r\ndid he keep the fact a secret. Shelley's letters, as well as the Irish\r\npamphlet, were eagerly read and discussed by all the young philosophers of\r\nSkinner Street.\r\n\r\n\"You cannot imagine,\" Godwin wrote to him, \"how much all the females of my\r\nfamily--Mrs. Godwin and three daughters--are interested in your letters\r\nand your history.\"\r\n\r\nPublicly propounded, however, Shelley's sentiments proved insufficiently\r\nattractive to those to whom they were addressed. At a public meeting where\r\nhe had ventured to enjoin on Catholics a tolerance so universal as to\r\nembrace not only Jews, Turks, and Infidels, but Protestants also, he\r\nnarrowly escaped being mobbed. It was borne in upon him before long that\r\nthe possibility, under existing conditions, of realising his scheme for\r\nassociations of peace and virtue, was doubtful and distant. He abandoned\r\nhis intention and left Ireland, professedly in submission to Godwin, but\r\nin fact convinced by what he had seen. Godwin was delighted.\r\n\r\n\"Now I can call you a friend,\" he wrote, and the good understanding of the\r\ntwo was cemented.\r\n\r\nAfter repeated but fruitless invitations from the Shelleys to the whole\r\nGodwin party to come and stay with them in Wales, Godwin, early in the\r\nautumn of this year (1812) actually made an expedition to Lynmouth, where\r\nhis unknown friends were staying, in the hope of effecting a personal\r\nacquaintance, but his object was frustrated, the Shelleys having left the\r\nplace just before he arrived.\r\n\r\nThey first met in London, in the month of October, and frequent, almost\r\ndaily intercourse took place between the families. On the last day of\r\ntheir stay in town the Shelleys, with Eliza Westbrook, dined in Skinner\r\nStreet. Mary Godwin, who had been for five months past in Scotland, had\r\nreturned, as we know, with Christy Baxter the day before, and was, no\r\ndoubt, very glad not to miss this opportunity of seeing the interesting\r\nyoung reformer of whom she had heard so much. His wife he had always\r\nspoken of as one who shared his tastes and opinions. No doubt they all\r\nthought her a fortunate woman, and Mary in after years would well recall\r\nher smiling face, and pink and white complexion, and her purple satin\r\ngown.\r\n\r\nDuring the year and a half that had elapsed since that time Mary had\r\nbeen chiefly away, and had heard little if anything of Shelley. In the\r\nspring of 1814, however, he came up to town to see her father on\r\nbusiness,--business in which Godwin was deeply and solely concerned, about\r\nwhich he was desperately anxious, and in which Mary knew that Shelley was\r\ndoing all in his power to help him. These matters had been going on for\r\nsome time, when, on the 5th of May, he came to Skinner Street, and Mary\r\nand he renewed acquaintance. Both had altered since the last time they\r\nmet. Mary, from a child had grown into a young, attractive, and\r\ninteresting girl. Hers was not the sweet sensuous loveliness of her\r\nmother, but with her well-shaped head and intellectual brow, her fine fair\r\nhair and liquid hazel eyes, and a skin and complexion of singular\r\nwhiteness and purity, she possessed beauty of a rare and refined type. She\r\nwas somewhat below the medium height; very graceful, with drooping\r\nshoulders and swan-like throat. The serene eloquent eyes contrasted with a\r\nsmall mouth, indicative of a certain reserve of temperament, which, in\r\nfact, always distinguished her, and beneath which those who did not know\r\nher might not have suspected her vigour of intellect and fearlessness of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nShelley, too, was changed; why, was in his case not so evident. Mary\r\nwould have heard how, just before her return home, he had been remarried\r\nto his wife; Godwin, the opponent of matrimony, having, mysteriously\r\nenough, been instrumental in procuring the licence for this superfluous\r\nceremony; superfluous, as the parties had been quite legally married in\r\nScotland three years before. His wife was not now with him in London. He\r\nwas alone, and appeared saddened in aspect, ailing in health, unsettled\r\nand anxious in mind. It was impossible that Mary should not observe him\r\nwith interest. She saw that, although so young a man, he not only could\r\nhold his own in discussion of literary, philosophical, or political\r\nquestions with the wisest heads and deepest thinkers of his generation,\r\nbut could throw new light on every subject he touched. His glowing\r\nimagination transfigured and idealised what it dwelt on, while his magical\r\nwords seemed to recreate whatever he described. She learned that he was a\r\npoet. His conversation would call up her old day-dreams again, though,\r\nbefore it, they paled and faded like morning mists before the sun. She\r\nsaw, too, that his disposition was most amiable, his manners gentle, his\r\nconversation absolutely free from suspicion of coarseness, and that he was\r\na disinterested and devoted friend.\r\n\r\nBefore long she must have become conscious that he took pleasure in\r\ntalking with her. She could not but see that, while his melancholy and\r\ndisquiet grew upon him every day, she possessed the power of banishing it\r\nfor the time. Her presence illumined him; life and hopeful enthusiasm\r\nwould flash anew from him if she was by. This intercourse stimulated all\r\nher intellectual powers, and its first effect was to increase her already\r\nkeen desire of knowledge. To keep pace with the electric mind of this\r\ncompanion required some effort on her part, and she applied herself with\r\nrenewed zeal to her studies. Nothing irritated her stepmother so much as\r\nto see her deep in a book, and in order to escape from Mrs. Godwin's petty\r\npersecution Mary used, whenever she could, to transport herself and her\r\noccupations to Old St. Pancras Churchyard, where she had been in the habit\r\nof coming to visit her mother's grave. There, under the shade of a willow\r\ntree, she would sit, book in hand, and sometimes read, but not always. The\r\nday-dreams of Dundee would now and again return upon her. How long she\r\nseemed to have lived since that time! Life no longer seemed \"so\r\ncommonplace an affair,\" nor yet her own part in it so infinitesimal if\r\nShelley thought her conversation and companionship worth the having.\r\n\r\nBefore very long he had found out the secret of her retreat, and used to\r\nmeet her there. He revered the memory of Mary Wollstonecraft, and her\r\ngrave was to him a consecrated shrine of which her daughter was the\r\npriestess.\r\n\r\nBy June they had become intimate friends, though Mary was still ignorant\r\nof the secret of his life.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of June occurred the meeting described by Hogg in his _Life of\r\nShelley_. The two friends were walking through Skinner Street when Shelley\r\nsaid to Hogg, \"I must speak with Godwin; come in, I will not detain you\r\nlong.\" Hogg continues--\r\n\r\n    I followed him through the shop, which was the only entrance, and\r\n    upstairs we entered a room on the first floor; it was shaped like a\r\n    quadrant. In the arc were windows; in one radius a fireplace, and in\r\n    the other a door, and shelves with many old books. William Godwin was\r\n    not at home. Bysshe strode about the room, causing the crazy floor of\r\n    the ill-built, unowned dwelling-house to shake and tremble under his\r\n    impatient footsteps. He appeared to be displeased at not finding the\r\n    fountain of Political Justice.\r\n\r\n    \"Where is Godwin?\" he asked me several times, as if I knew. I did not\r\n    know, and, to say the truth, I did not care. He continued his uneasy\r\n    promenade; and I stood reading the names of old English authors on the\r\n    backs of the venerable volumes, when the door was partially and softly\r\n    opened. A thrilling voice called \"Shelley!\" A thrilling voice answered\r\n    \"Mary!\" and he darted out of the room, like an arrow from the bow of\r\n    the far-shooting king. A very young female, fair and fair-haired, pale\r\n    indeed, and with a piercing look, wearing a frock of tartan, an\r\n    unusual dress in London at that time, had called him out of the room.\r\n    He was absent a very short time, a minute or two, and then returned.\r\n\r\n    \"Godwin is out, there is no use in waiting.\" So we continued our walk\r\n    along Holborn.\r\n\r\n    \"Who was that, pray?\" I asked, \"a daughter?\"\r\n\r\n    \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n    \"A daughter of William Godwin?\"\r\n\r\n    \"The daughter of Godwin and Mary.\"\r\n\r\nHogg asked no more questions, but something in this momentary interview\r\nand in the look of the fair-haired girl left an impression on his mind\r\nwhich he did not at once forget.\r\n\r\nGodwin was all this time seeking and encouraging Shelley's visits. He was\r\nin feverish distress for money, bankruptcy was hanging over his head; and\r\nShelley was exerting all his energies and influence to raise a large sum,\r\nit is said as much as L3000, for him. It is a melancholy fact that the\r\nphilosopher had got to regard those who, in the thirsty search for truth\r\nand knowledge, had attached themselves to him, in the secondary light of\r\npossible sources of income, and, when in difficulties, he came upon them\r\none after another for loans or advances of money, which, at first begged\r\nfor as a kindness, came to be claimed by him almost as a right.\r\n\r\nShelley's own affairs were in a most unsatisfactory state. L200 a year\r\nfrom his father, and as much from his wife's father was all he had to\r\ndepend upon, and his unsettled life and frequent journeys, generous\r\ndisposition and careless ways, made fearful inroads on his narrow income,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that he lived with Spartan frugality as far as\r\nhis own habits were concerned. Little as he had, he never knew how little\r\nit was nor how far it would go, and, while he strained every nerve to save\r\nfrom ruin one whom he still considered his intellectual father, he was\r\nhimself sorely hampered by want of money.\r\n\r\nVisits to lawyers by Godwin, Shelley, or both, were of increasingly\r\nfrequent occurrence during May; in June we learn of as many as two or\r\nthree in a day. While this was going on, Shelley, the forlorn hope of\r\nSkinner Street, could not be lost sight of. If he seemed to find pleasure\r\nin Mary's society, this probably flattered Mary's father, who, though\r\nreally knowing little of his child, was undoubtedly proud of her, her\r\nbeauty, and her promise of remarkable talent. Like other fathers, he\r\nthought of her as a child, and, had there been any occasion for suspicion\r\nor remark, the fact of Shelley's being a married man with a lovely wife,\r\nwould take away any excuse for dwelling on it. The Shelleys had not been\r\nfavourites with Mrs. Godwin, who, the year before, had offended or chosen\r\nto quarrel with Harriet Shelley. The respective husbands had succeeded in\r\nsmoothing over the difficulty, which was subsequently ignored. No love was\r\nlost, however, between the Shelleys and the head of the firm of M. J.\r\nGodwin & Co., who, however, was not now likely to do or say anything\r\ncalculated to drive from the house one who, for the present, was its sole\r\nchance of existence.\r\n\r\nFrom the 20th of June until the end of the month Shelley was at Skinner\r\nStreet every day, often to dinner.\r\n\r\nBy that time he and Mary had realised, only too well, the depth of their\r\nmutual feeling, and on some one day, what day we do not know, they owned\r\nit to each other. His history was poured out to her, not as it appears in\r\nthe cold impartial light of after years perhaps, but as he felt it then,\r\naching and smarting from life's fresh wounds and stings. She heard of his\r\ndifficulties, his rebuffs, his mistakes in action, his disappointments in\r\nfriendship, his fruitless sacrifices for what he held to be the truth; his\r\nhopes and his hopelessness, his isolation of soul and his craving for\r\nsympathy. She guessed, for he was still silent on this point, that he\r\nfound it not in his home. She faced her feelings then; they were past\r\nmistake. But it never occurred to her mind that there was any possible\r\nfuture but a life's separation to souls so situated. She could be his\r\nfriend, never anything more to him.\r\n\r\nAs a memento of that interview Shelley gave or sent her a copy of _Queen\r\nMab_, his first published poem. This book (still in existence) has,\r\nwritten in pencil inside the cover, the name \"Mary Wollstonecraft\r\nGodwin,\" and, on the inner flyleaf, the words, \"You see, Mary, I have not\r\nforgotten you.\" Under the printed dedication to his wife is the enigmatic\r\nbut suggestive remark, carefully written in ink, \"Count Slobendorf was\r\nabout to marry a woman, who, attracted solely by his fortune, proved her\r\nselfishness by deserting him in prison.\"[2] On the flyleaves at the end\r\nMary wrote in July 1814--\r\n\r\n    This book is sacred to me, and as no other creature shall ever look\r\n    into it, I may write what I please. Yet what shall I write? That I\r\n    love the author beyond all powers of expression, and that I am parted\r\n    from him. Dearest and only love, by that love we have promised to each\r\n    other, although I may not be yours, I can never be another's. But I am\r\n    thine, exclusively thine.\r\n\r\n      By the kiss of love, the glance none saw beside,\r\n      The smile none else might understand,\r\n      The whispered thought of hearts allied,\r\n      The pressure of the thrilling hand.[3]\r\n\r\n    I have pledged myself to thee, and sacred is the gift. I remember your\r\n    words. \"You are now, Mary, going to mix with many, and for a moment I\r\n    shall depart, but in the solitude of your chamber I shall be with\r\n    you.\" Yes, you are ever with me, sacred vision.\r\n\r\n      But ah! I feel in this was given\r\n      A blessing never meant for me,\r\n      Thou art too like a dream from heaven\r\n      For earthly love to merit thee.[4]\r\n\r\nWith this mutual consciousness, yet obliged inevitably to meet, thrown\r\nconstantly in each other's way, Mary obliged too to look on Shelley as her\r\nfather's benefactor and support, their situation was a miserable one. As\r\nfor Shelley, when he had once broken silence he passed rapidly from tender\r\naffection to the most passionate love. His heart and brain were alike on\r\nfire, for at the root of his deep depression and unsettlement lay the\r\nfact, known as yet only to himself, of complete estrangement between\r\nhimself and his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nJUNE-AUGUST 1814\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps of all the objects of Shelley's devotion up to this time, Harriet,\r\nhis wife, was the only one with whom he had never, in the ideal sense,\r\nbeen in love. Possibly this was one reason that against her alone he never\r\nhad the violent revulsion, almost amounting to loathing, which was the\r\nusual reaction after his other passionate illusions. He had eloped with\r\nher when they were but boy and girl because he found her ready to elope\r\nwith him, and because he was persuaded that she was a victim of tyranny\r\nand oppression, which, to this modern knight-errant, was tantamount to an\r\nobligation laid on him to rescue her. Having eloped with her, he had\r\nmarried her, for her sake, and from a sense of chivalry, only with a\r\nquaint sort of apology to his friend Hogg for this early departure from\r\nhis own principles and those of the philosophic writers who had helped to\r\nmould his views. His affection for his wife had steadily increased after\r\ntheir marriage; she was fond of him and satisfied with her lot, and had\r\nmade things very easy for him. She could not give him anything very deep\r\nin the way of love, but in return she was not very exacting; accommodating\r\nherself with good humour to all his vagaries, his changes of mood and\r\nplan, and his romantic friendships. Even the presence of her elder sister\r\nEliza, who at an early period established herself as a member of their\r\nhousehold, did not destroy although it did not add to their peace. It was\r\nduring their stay in Scotland, in 1813, that the first shadow arose\r\nbetween them, and from this time Harriet seems to have changed. She became\r\ncold and indifferent. During the next winter, when they lived at\r\nBracknell, she grew frivolous and extravagant, even yielding to habits of\r\nself-indulgence most repugnant to one so abstemious as Shelley. He, on his\r\npart, was more and more drawn away from the home which had become\r\nuncongenial by the fascinating society of his brilliant, speculative\r\nfriend, Mrs. Boinville (the white-haired \"Maimuna\"), her daughter and\r\nsister. They were kind and encouraging to him, and their whole circle was\r\ncheerful, genial, and intellectual. This intimacy tended to widen the\r\nbreach between husband and wife, while supplying none of the moral help\r\nwhich might have braced Shelley to meet his difficulty. His letters and\r\nthe stanza addressed to Mrs. Boinville[5] show the profound depression\r\nunder which he laboured in April and May. His pathetic poem to Harriet,\r\nwritten in May, expresses only too plainly what he suffered from her\r\nalienation, and also his keen consciousness of the moral dangers that\r\nthreatened him from the loosening of old ties, if left to himself\r\nunsupported by sympathy at home. But such feeling as Harriet had was at\r\nthis time quite blunted. She had treated his unsettled depression and\r\ngloomy abstraction as coldness and sullen discontent, and met them with\r\ncareless unconcern. Always a puppet in the hands of some one stronger than\r\nherself, she was encouraged by her elder sister, \"the ever-present Eliza,\"\r\nthe object of Shelley's abhorrence, to meet any want of attention on his\r\npart by this attitude of indifference; presumably on the assumption that\r\nmen do not care for what they can have cheaply, and that the best way for\r\na wife to keep a husband's affection is to show herself independent of it.\r\nGood-humoured and shallow, easy-going and fond of amusement, she probably\r\nyielded to these counsels without difficulty. She was much admired by\r\nother men, and accepted their admiration willingly. From evidence which\r\ncame to light not many years later, it appears Shelley thought he had\r\nreason to believe she had been misled by one of these admirers, and that\r\nhe became aware of this in June 1814. No word of it was breathed by him at\r\nthe time, and the painful story might never have been divulged but for\r\nsubsequent events which dragged into publicity circumstances which he\r\nintended should be buried in oblivion. This is not a life of Shelley, and\r\nthe evidence of all this matter,--such evidence, that is, as has escaped\r\ndestruction,--must be looked for elsewhere. In the lawsuit which he\r\nundertook after Harriet's death to obtain possession of his children by\r\nher, he was content to state, \"I was united to a woman of whom delicacy\r\nforbids me to say more than that we were disunited by incurable\r\ndissensions.\"\r\n\r\nThat time only confirmed his conviction of 1814 is clearly proved by his\r\nletter, written six years afterwards, to Southey, who had accused him of\r\nguilt towards both his first and second wives.\r\n\r\n    I take God to witness, if such a Being is now regarding both you and\r\n    me, and I pledge myself if we meet, as perhaps you expect, before Him\r\n    after death, to repeat the same in His presence, that you accuse me\r\n    wrongfully. I am innocent of ill, either done or intended, the\r\n    consequences you allude to flowed in no respect from me. If you were\r\n    my friend, I could tell you a history that would make you open your\r\n    eyes, but I shall certainly never make the public my familiar\r\n    confidant.\r\n\r\nIt is quite certain that in June 1814 Shelley, who had for months found\r\nhis wife heartless, became convinced that she had also been faithless. A\r\nbreach of the marriage vow was not, now or at any other time, regarded by\r\nhim in the light of a heinous or unpardonable sin. Like his master Godwin,\r\nwho held that right and wrong in these matters could only be decided by\r\nthe circumstances of each individual case, he considered the vow itself to\r\nbe the mistake, superfluous where it was based on mutual affection,\r\ntyrannic or false where it was not. Nor did he recognise two different\r\nlaws, for men and for women, in these respects. His subsequent relations\r\nwith Harriet show that, deeply as she had wounded him, he did not consider\r\nher criminally in fault. Could she indeed be blamed for applying in her\r\nown way the dangerous principles of which she had heard so much? But she\r\nhad ceased to care for him, and the death of mutual love argued, to his\r\nmind, the loosening of the tie. He had been faithful to her; her\r\nfaithlessness cut away the ground from under his feet and left him\r\ndefenceless against a new affection.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that when his friend Peacock went, by his request, to call on\r\nhim in London, he\r\n\r\n    showed in his looks, in his gestures, in his speech, the state of a\r\n    mind, \"suffering like a little kingdom, the nature of an\r\n    insurrection.\" His eyes were bloodshot, his hair and dress disordered.\r\n    He caught up a bottle of laudanum and said, \"I never part from this!\"\r\n    He added, \"I am always repeating to myself your lines from Sophocles--\r\n\r\n      Man's happiest lot is not to be,\r\n      And when we tread life's thorny steep\r\n      Most blest are they, who, earliest free,\r\n      Descend to death's eternal sleep.\"\r\n\r\nHarriet had been absent for some time at Bath, but now, growing anxious at\r\nthe rarity of news from her husband, she wrote up to Hookham, his\r\npublisher, entreating to know what had become of him, and where he was.\r\n\r\nGodwin, who called at Hookham's the next day, heard of this letter, and\r\nbegan at last to awaken to the consciousness that something he did not\r\nunderstand was going on between Shelley and his daughter. It is strange\r\nthat Mrs. Godwin, a shrewd and suspicious woman, should not before now\r\nhave called his attention to the fact. His diary for 8th July records a\r\n\"Talk with Mary.\" What passed has not transpired. Probably Godwin\r\n\"restricted himself to uttering his censures with seriousness and\r\nemphasis,\"[6] probably Mary said little of any sort.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of July Harriet Shelley came up to town, summoned thither by a\r\nletter from her husband. He informed her of his determination to\r\nseparate, and of his intention to take immediate measures securing her a\r\nsufficient income for her support. He fully expected that Harriet would\r\nwillingly concur in this arrangement, but she did no such thing; perhaps\r\nshe did not believe he would carry it out. She never at any time took life\r\nseriously; she looked on the rupture between herself and Shelley as\r\ntrivial and temporary, and had no wish to make it otherwise. Godwin called\r\non her two or three times; he was aware of the estrangement, and probably\r\nhoped by argument and discussion to restore matters to their old footing\r\nand bring peace and equanimity to his own household. But although Harriet\r\nwas quite aware of Shelley's love for Godwin's daughter, and knew, too,\r\nthat deeds were being prepared to assure her own separate maintenance, she\r\nsaid nothing to Godwin, nor did her family give him any hint. The\r\nimpending elopement, with all its consequences to Godwin, were within her\r\npower to prevent, but she allowed matters to take their course. Godwin,\r\nevidently very uncomfortable, chronicles a \"Talk with P. B. S.,\" and, on\r\n22d July, a \"Talk with Jane.\" But circumstances moved faster than he\r\nexpected, and these many talks and discussions and complicated moves and\r\ncounter-moves only made the position intolerable, and precipitated the\r\nfinal crisis. Towards the close of that month Shelley's confession was\r\nwrung from him: he told Mary the whole truth, and how, though legally\r\nbound, he held himself morally free to offer himself to her if she would\r\nbe his.\r\n\r\nTo her, passionately devoted to the one man who was and was ever to remain\r\nthe sun and centre of her existence, the thought of a wife indifferent to\r\nhim, hard to him, false to him, was sacrilege; it was torture. She had not\r\nbeen brought up to look on marriage as a divine institution; she had\r\nprobably never even heard it discussed but on grounds of expediency.\r\nHarriet was his legal wife, so he could not marry Mary, but what of that,\r\nafter all? if there was a sacrifice in her power to make for him, was not\r\nthat the greatest joy, the greatest honour that life could have in store\r\nfor her?\r\n\r\nThat her father would openly condemn her she knew, for she must have known\r\nthat Godwin's practice did not move on the same lofty plane as his\r\nprinciples. Was he not at that moment making himself debtor to a man whose\r\nintegrity he doubted? Had he not, in twice marrying, taken care to\r\nproclaim, both to his friends and the public, that he did so _in spite_ of\r\nhis opinions, which remained unchanged and unretracted, until some\r\ninconvenient application of them forced from him an expression of\r\ndisapproval?\r\n\r\nHer mother too, had she not held that ties which were dead should be\r\nburied? and though not, like Godwin, condemning marriage as an\r\ninstitution, had she not been twice induced to form a connection which in\r\none instance never was, in the other was not for some time consecrated by\r\nlaw? Who was Mary herself, that she should withstand one whom she felt to\r\nbe the best as well as the cleverest man she had ever known? To talent she\r\nhad been accustomed all her life, but here she saw something different,\r\nand what of all things calls forth most ardent response from a young and\r\npure-minded girl, _a genius for goodness_; an aspiration and devotion such\r\nas she had dreamed of but never known, with powers which seemed to her\r\nabsolutely inspired. She loved him, and she appreciated him,--as time\r\nabundantly showed,--rightly. She conceived that she wronged by her action\r\nno one but herself, and she did not hesitate. She pledged her heart and\r\nhand to Shelley for life, and she did not disappoint him, nor he her.\r\n\r\nTo the end of their lives, tried as they were to be by every kind of\r\ntrouble, neither one nor the other ever repented the step they now took,\r\nnor modified their opinion of the grounds on which they took it. How\r\nShelley regarded it in after years we have already seen. Mary, writing\r\nduring her married life, when her judgment had been matured and her\r\nyouthful buoyancy of spirit only too well sobered by stern and bitter\r\nexperience, can find no harder name for it than \"an imprudence.\" Many\r\nyears after, in 1825, alluding to Shelley's separation from Harriet, she\r\nremarks, \"His justification is, to me, obvious.\" And at a later date\r\nstill, when she had been seventeen years a widow, she wrote in the preface\r\nto her edition of Shelley's _Poems_--\r\n\r\n    I abstain from any remark on the occurrences of his private life,\r\n    except inasmuch as the passions they engendered inspired his poetry.\r\n    This is not the time to relate the truth, and I should reject any\r\n    colouring of the truth. No account of these events has ever been given\r\n    at all approaching reality in their details, either as regards himself\r\n    or others; nor shall I further allude to them than to remark that the\r\n    errors of action committed by a man as noble and generous as Shelley,\r\n    may, as far as he only is concerned, be fearlessly avowed by those who\r\n    loved him, in the firm conviction that, were they judged impartially,\r\n    his character would stand in fairer and brighter light than that of\r\n    any contemporary.\r\n\r\nBut they never \"made the public their familiar confidant.\" They screened\r\nthe erring as far as it was in their power to do so, although their\r\nreticence cost them dear, for it lent a colouring of probability to the\r\nslanders and misconstruction of all kinds which it was their constant fate\r\nto endure for others' sake, which pursued them to their lives' end, and\r\nbeyond it.\r\n\r\nLife, which is to no one what he expects, had many clouds for them. Mary's\r\nlife reached its zenith too suddenly, and with happiness came care in\r\nundue proportion. The future of intellectual expansion and creation which\r\nmight have been hers was not to be fully realised, but perfections of\r\ncharacter she might never have attained developed themselves as her nature\r\nwas mellowed and moulded by time and by suffering.\r\n\r\nShelley's rupture with his first wife marks the end of his boyhood. Up to\r\nthat time, thanks to his poetic temperament, his were the strong and\r\nsimple, but passing impulses and feelings of a child. \"A being of large\r\ndiscourse\" he assuredly was, but not as yet \"looking before and after.\"\r\nNow he was to acquire the doubtful blessing of that faculty. Like Undine\r\nwhen she became endued with a soul, he gained an immeasurable good, while\r\nhe lost a something that never returned.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of 28th July 1814 Mary Godwin secretly left her\r\nfather's house, accompanied by Jane Clairmont, and they started with\r\nShelley in a post-chaise for Dover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nAUGUST 1814-JANUARY 1816\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the day of their departure a joint journal was kept by Shelley and\r\nMary, which tells their subsequent adventures and vicissitudes with the\r\nutmost candour and _naivete_. A great deal of the earlier portion is\r\nwritten by Shelley, but after a time Mary becomes the principal diarist,\r\nand the latter part is almost entirely hers. Its account of their first\r\nwanderings in France and Switzerland was put into narrative form by her\r\ntwo or three years later, and published under the title _Journal of a Six\r\nWeeks' Tour_. But the transparent simplicity of the journal is invaluable,\r\nand carries with it an absolute conviction which no studied account can\r\nemulate or improve upon. Considerable portions are, therefore, given in\r\ntheir entirety.\r\n\r\nThat 28th of July was a hotter day than had been known in England for many\r\nyears. Between the sultry heat and exhaustion from the excitement and\r\nconflicting emotions of the last days, poor Mary was completely overcome.\r\n\r\n    \"The heat made her faint,\" wrote Shelley, \"it was necessary at every\r\n    stage that she should repose. I was divided between anxiety for her\r\n    health and terror lest our pursuers should arrive. I reproached myself\r\n    with not allowing her sufficient time to rest, with conceiving any\r\n    evil so great that the slightest portion of her comfort might be\r\n    sacrificed to avoid it.\r\n\r\n    \"At Dartford we took four horses, that we might outstrip pursuit. We\r\n    arrived at Dover before four o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n    \"On arriving at Dover,\" writes Mary,[7] \"I was refreshed by a\r\n    sea-bath. As we very much wished to cross the Channel with all\r\n    possible speed, we would not wait for the packet of the following day\r\n    (it being then about four in the afternoon), but hiring a small boat,\r\n    resolved to make the passage the same evening, the seamen promising us\r\n    a voyage of two hours.\r\n\r\n    \"The evening was most beautiful; there was but little wind, and the\r\n    sails flapped in the flagging breeze; the moon rose, and night came\r\n    on, and with the night a slow, heavy swell and a fresh breeze, which\r\n    soon produced a sea so violent as to toss the boat very much. I was\r\n    dreadfully sea-sick, and, as is usually my custom when thus affected,\r\n    I slept during the greater part of the night, awaking only from time\r\n    to time to ask where we were, and to receive the dismal answer each\r\n    time, 'Not quite halfway.'\r\n\r\n    \"The wind was violent and contrary; if we could not reach Calais the\r\n    sailors proposed making for Boulogne. They promised only two hours'\r\n    sail from shore, yet hour after hour passed, and we were still far\r\n    distant, when the moon sunk in the red and stormy horizon and the\r\n    fast-flashing lightning became pale in the breaking day.\r\n\r\n    \"We were proceeding slowly against the wind, when suddenly a thunder\r\n    squall struck the sail, and the waves rushed into the boat: even the\r\n    sailors acknowledged that our situation was perilous; but they\r\n    succeeded in reefing the sail; the wind was now changed, and we drove\r\n    before the gale directly to Calais.\"\r\n\r\n    _Journal_ (Shelley).--Mary did not know our danger; she was resting\r\n    between my knees, that were unable to support her; she did not speak\r\n    or look, but I felt that she was there. I had time in that moment to\r\n    reflect, and even to reason upon death; it was rather a thing of\r\n    discomfort and disappointment than horror to me. We should never be\r\n    separated, but in death we might not know and feel our union as now. I\r\n    hope, but my hopes are not unmixed with fear for what may befall this\r\n    inestimable spirit when we appear to die.\r\n\r\n    The morning broke, the lightning died away, the violence of the wind\r\n    abated. We arrived at Calais, whilst Mary still slept; we drove upon\r\n    the sands. Suddenly the broad sun rose over France.\r\n\r\nGodwin's diary for 28th July runs,\r\n\r\n    \"_Five in the morning._ M. J. for Dover.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Godwin, in fact, started in pursuit of the fugitives as soon as they\r\nwere missed. Neither Shelley nor Mary were the objects of her anxiety, but\r\nher own daughter. Jane Clairmont, who cared no more for her mother than\r\nshe did for any one else, had guessed Mary's secret or insinuated herself\r\ninto her confidence some time before the final _denouement_ of the\r\nlove-affair. Wild and wayward, ready for anything in the shape of a\r\nromantic adventure, and longing for freedom from the restraints of home,\r\nshe had sympathised with, and perhaps helped Shelley and Mary. She was in\r\nno wise anxious to be left to mope alone, nor to be exposed to\r\ncross-questioning she could ill have met. She claimed to escape with them\r\nas a return for her good offices, and whatever Mary may have thought or\r\nwished, Shelley was not one to leave her behind \"in slavery.\" Mrs. Godwin\r\narrived at Calais by the very packet the fugitives had refused to wait\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n    _Journal_ (Shelley).--In the evening Captain Davidson came and told us\r\n    that a fat lady had arrived who said I had run away with her daughter;\r\n    it was Mrs. Godwin. Jane spent the night with her mother.\r\n\r\n    _July 30._--Jane informs us that she is unable to withstand the pathos\r\n    of Mrs. Godwin's appeal. She appealed to the Municipality of Paris, to\r\n    past slavery and to future freedom. I counselled her to take at least\r\n    half an hour for consideration. She returned to Mrs. Godwin and\r\n    informed her that she resolved to continue with us.\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Godwin departed without answering a word.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand how this mother had so little authority over\r\nher own girl of sixteen. She might rule Godwin, but she evidently could\r\nnot influence, far less rule her daughter. Shelley's influence, as far as\r\nit was exerted at all, was used in favour of Jane's remaining with them,\r\nand he paid dearly in after years for the heavy responsibility he now\r\nassumed.\r\n\r\nThe travellers proceeded to Paris, where they were obliged to remain\r\nlonger than they intended, finding themselves so absolutely without money,\r\nnothing having been prearranged in their sudden flight, that Shelley had\r\nto sell his watch and chain for eight napoleons. Funds were at last\r\nprocured through Tavernier, a French man of business, and they were free\r\nto put into execution the plan they had resolved upon, namely, to _walk_\r\nthrough France, buying an ass to carry their portmanteau and one of them\r\nby turns.\r\n\r\n    _Journal, August 8_ (Mary).--Jane and Shelley go to the ass merchant;\r\n    we buy an ass. The day spent in preparation for departure.\r\n\r\nTheir landlady tried to dissuade them from their design.\r\n\r\n    She represented to us that a large army had been recently disbanded,\r\n    that the soldiers and officers wandered idle about the country, and\r\n    that _les dames seroient certainement enlevees_. But we were proof\r\n    against her arguments, and, packing up a few necessaries, leaving the\r\n    rest to go by the diligence, we departed in a _fiacre_ from the door\r\n    of the hotel, our little ass following.[8]\r\n\r\n    _Journal_ (Mary).--We set out to Charenton in the evening, carrying\r\n    the ass, who was weak and unfit for labour, like the Miller and his\r\n    Son.\r\n\r\n    We dismissed the coach at the barrier. It was dusk, and the ass seemed\r\n    totally unable to bear one of us, appearing to sink under the\r\n    portmanteau, though it was small and light. We were, however, merry\r\n    enough, and thought the leagues short. We arrived at Charenton about\r\n    ten. Charenton is prettily situated in a valley, through which the\r\n    Seine flows, winding among banks variegated with trees. On looking at\r\n    this scene C... (Jane) exclaimed, \"Oh! this is beautiful enough; let\r\n    us live here.\" This was her exclamation on every new scene, and as\r\n    each surpassed the one before, she cried, \"I am glad we did not live\r\n    at Charenton, but let us live here.\"[9]\r\n\r\n    _August 9_ (Shelley).--We sell our ass and purchase a mule, in which\r\n    we much resemble him who never made a bargain but always lost half.\r\n    The day is most beautiful.\r\n\r\n    (Mary).--About nine o'clock we departed; we were clad in black silk. I\r\n    rode on the mule, which carried also our portmanteau. S. and C. (Jane)\r\n    followed, bringing a small basket of provisions. At about one we\r\n    arrived at Gros-Bois, where, under the shade of trees, we ate our\r\n    bread and fruit, and drank our wine, thinking of Don Quixote and\r\n    Sancho Panza.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, August 11_ (Mary).--From Provins we came to Nogent. The\r\n    town was entirely desolated by the Cossacks; the houses were reduced\r\n    to heaps of white ruins, and the bridge was destroyed. Proceeding on\r\n    our way we left the great road and arrived at St. Aubin, a beautiful\r\n    little village situated among trees. This village was also completely\r\n    destroyed. The inhabitants told us the Cossacks had not left one cow\r\n    in the village. Notwithstanding the entreaties of the people, who\r\n    eagerly desired us to stay all night, we continued our route to Trois\r\n    Maisons, three long leagues farther, on an unfrequented road, and\r\n    which in many places was hardly perceptible from the surrounding\r\n    waste....\r\n\r\n    As night approached our fears increased that we should not be able to\r\n    distinguish the road, and Mary expressed these fears in a very\r\n    complaining tone. We arrived at Trois Maisons at nine o'clock. Jane\r\n    went up to the first cottage to ask our way, but was only answered by\r\n    unmeaning laughter. We, however, discovered a kind of an _auberge_,\r\n    where, having in some degree satisfied our hunger by milk and sour\r\n    bread, we retired to a wretched apartment to bed. But first let me\r\n    observe that we discovered that the inhabitants were not in the habit\r\n    of washing themselves, either when they rose or went to bed.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, August 12._--We did not set out from here till eleven\r\n    o'clock, and travelled a long league under the very eye of a burning\r\n    sun. Shelley, having sprained his leg, was obliged to ride all day.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, August 13_ (Troyes).--We are disgusted with the excessive\r\n    dirt of our habitation. Shelley goes to inquire about conveyances. He\r\n    sells the mule for forty francs and the saddle for sixteen francs. In\r\n    all our bargains for ass, saddle, and mule we lose more than fifteen\r\n    napoleons. Money we can but little spare now. Jane and Shelley seek\r\n    for a conveyance to Neufchatel.\r\n\r\nFrom Troyes Shelley wrote to Harriet, expressing his anxiety for her\r\nwelfare, and urging her in her own interests to come out to Switzerland,\r\nwhere he, who would always remain her best and most disinterested friend,\r\nwould procure for her some sweet retreat among the mountains. He tells her\r\nsome details of their adventures in the simplest manner imaginable; never,\r\napparently, doubting for a moment but that they would interest her as much\r\nas they did him. Harriet, it is needless to say, did not come. Had she\r\ndone so, she would not have found Shelley, for, as the sequel shows, he\r\nwas back in London almost as soon as she could have got to Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    _Journal, August 14_ (Mary).--At four in the morning we depart from\r\n    Troyes, and proceed in the new vehicle to Vandeuvres. The village\r\n    remains still ruined by the war. We rest at Vandeuvres two hours, but\r\n    walk in a wood belonging to a neighbouring chateau, and sleep under\r\n    its shade. The moss was so soft; the murmur of the wind in the leaves\r\n    was sweeter than Aeolian music; we forgot that we were in France or in\r\n    the world for a time.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _August 17._--The _voiturier_ insists upon our passing the night at\r\n    the village of Mort. We go out on the rocks, and Shelley and I read\r\n    part of _Mary_, a fiction. We return at dark, and, unable to enter the\r\n    beds, we pass a few comfortless hours by the kitchen fireside.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, August 18._--We leave Mort at four. After some hours of\r\n    tedious travelling, through a most beautiful country, we arrive at\r\n    Noe. From the summit of one of the hills we see the whole expanse of\r\n    the valley filled with a white, undulating mist, over which the piny\r\n    hills pierced like islands. The sun had just risen, and a ray of the\r\n    red light lay on the waves of this fluctuating vapour. To the west,\r\n    opposite the sun, it seemed driven by the light against the rock in\r\n    immense masses of foaming cloud until it becomes lost in the distance,\r\n    mixing its tints with the fleecy sky. At Noe, whilst our postillion\r\n    waited, we walked into the forest of pines; it was a scene of\r\n    enchantment, where every sound and sight contributed to charm.\r\n\r\n    Our mossy seat in the deepest recesses of the wood was enclosed from\r\n    the world by an impenetrable veil. On our return the postillion had\r\n    departed without us; he left word that he expected to meet us on the\r\n    road. We proceeded there upon foot to Maison Neuve, an _auberge_ a\r\n    league distant. At Maison Neuve he had left a message importing that\r\n    he should proceed to Pontarlier, six leagues distant, and that unless\r\n    he found us there he should return. We despatched a boy on horseback\r\n    for him; he promised to wait for us at the next village; we walked two\r\n    leagues in the expectation of finding him there. The evening was most\r\n    beautiful; the horned moon hung in the light of sunset that threw a\r\n    glow of unusual depth of redness above the piny mountains and the dark\r\n    deep valleys which they included. At Savrine we found, according to\r\n    our expectation, that M. le Voiturier had pursued his journey with the\r\n    utmost speed. We engaged a _voiture_ for Pontarlier. Jane very unable\r\n    to walk. The moon becomes yellow and hangs close to the woody horizon.\r\n    It is dark before we arrive at Pontarlier. The postillion tells many\r\n    lies. We sleep, for the first time in France, in a clean bed.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, August 19._--We pursue our journey towards Neufchatel. We\r\n    pass delightful scenes of verdure surpassing imagination; here first\r\n    we see clear mountain streams. We pass the barrier between France and\r\n    Switzerland, and, after descending nearly a league, between lofty\r\n    rocks covered with pines and interspersed with green glades, where the\r\n    grass is short and soft and beautifully verdant, we arrive at St.\r\n    Sulpice. The mule is very lame; we determined to engage another horse\r\n    for the remainder of the way. Our _voiturier_ had determined to leave\r\n    us, and had taken measures to that effect. The mountains after St.\r\n    Sulpice become loftier and more beautiful. Two leagues from Neufchatel\r\n    we see the Alps; hill after hill is seen extending its craggy outline\r\n    before the other, and far behind all, towering above every feature of\r\n    the scene, the snowy Alps; they are 100 miles distant; they look like\r\n    those accumulated clouds of dazzling white that arrange themselves on\r\n    the horizon in summer. This immensity staggers the imagination, and so\r\n    far surpasses all conception that it requires an effort of the\r\n    understanding to believe that they are indeed mountains. We arrive at\r\n    Neufchatel and sleep.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, August 20._--We consult on our situation. There are no\r\n    letters at the _bureau de poste_; there cannot be for a week. Shelley\r\n    goes to the banker's, who promises an answer in two hours; at the\r\n    conclusion of the time he sends for Shelley, and, to our astonishment\r\n    and consolation, Shelley returns staggering under the weight of a\r\n    large canvas bag full of silver. Shelley alone looks grave on the\r\n    occasion, for he alone clearly apprehends that francs and ecus and\r\n    louis d'or are like the white and flying cloud of noon, that is gone\r\n    before one can say \"Jack Robinson.\" Shelley goes to secure a place in\r\n    the diligence; they are all taken. He meets there with a Swiss who\r\n    speaks English; this man is imbued with the spirit of true politeness.\r\n    He endeavours to perform real services, and seems to regard the mere\r\n    ceremonies of the affair as things of very little value. He makes a\r\n    bargain with a _voiturier_ to take us to Lucerne for eighteen ecus.\r\n\r\n    We arrange to depart at four the next morning. Our Swiss friend\r\n    appoints to meet us there.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, August 21._--Go from Neufchatel at six; our Swiss accompanies\r\n    us a little way out of town. There is a mist to-day, so we cannot see\r\n    the Alps; the drive, however, is interesting, especially in the latter\r\n    part of the day. Shelley and Jane talk concerning Jane's character. We\r\n    arrive before seven at Soleure. Shelley and Mary go to the\r\n    much-praised cathedral, and find it very modern and stupid.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, August 22._--Leave Soleure at half-past five; very cold\r\n    indeed, but we now again see the magnificent mountains of Le Valais.\r\n    Mary is not well, and all are tired of wheeled machines. Shelley is in\r\n    a jocosely horrible mood. We dine at Zoffingen, and sleep there two\r\n    hours. In our drive after dinner we see the mountains of St. Gothard,\r\n    etc. Change our plan of going over St. Gothard. Arrive tired to death;\r\n    find at the room of the inn a horrible spinet and a case of stuffed\r\n    birds. Sup at _table d'hote_.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, August 23._--We leave at four o'clock and arrive at Lucerne\r\n    about ten. After breakfast we hire a boat to take us down the lake.\r\n    Shelley and Mary go out to buy several needful things, and then we\r\n    embark. It is a most divine day; the farther we advance the more\r\n    magnificent are the shores of the lake--rock and pine forests covering\r\n    the feet of the immense mountains. We read part of L'Abbe Barruel's\r\n    _Histoire du Jacobinisme_. We land at Bessen, go to the wrong inn,\r\n    where a most comical scene ensues. We sleep at Brunnen. Before we\r\n    sleep, however, we look out of window.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, August 24._--We consult on our situation. We cannot\r\n    procure a house; we are in despair; the filth of the apartment is\r\n    terrible to Mary; she cannot bear it all the winter. We propose to\r\n    proceed to Fluelen, but the wind comes from Italy, and will not\r\n    permit. At last we find a lodging in an ugly house they call the\r\n    Chateau for one louis a month, which we take; it consists of two\r\n    rooms. Mary and Shelley walk to the shore of the lake and read the\r\n    description of the Siege of Jerusalem in Tacitus. We come home, look\r\n    out of window and go to bed.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, August 25._--We read Abbe Barruel. Shelley and Jane make\r\n    purchases; we pack up our things and take possession of our house,\r\n    which we have engaged for six months. Receive a visit from the\r\n    _Medecin_ and the old Abbe, whom, it must be owned, we do not treat\r\n    with proper politeness. We arrange our apartment, and write part of\r\n    Shelley's romance.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, August 26._--Write the romance till three o'clock. Propose\r\n    crossing Mount St. Gothard. Determine at last to return to England;\r\n    only wait to set off till the washerwoman brings home our linen. The\r\n    little Frenchman arrives with tubs and plums and scissors and salt.\r\n    The linen is not dry; we are compelled to wait until to-morrow. We\r\n    engage a boat to take us to Lucerne at six the following morning.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, August 27._--We depart at seven; it rains violently till\r\n    just the end of our voyage. We conjecture the astonishment of the good\r\n    people at Brunnen. We arrive at Lucerne, dine, then write a part of\r\n    the romance, and read _Shakespeare_. Interrupted by Jane's horrors;\r\n    pack up. We have engaged a boat for Basle.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, August 28._--Depart at six o'clock. The river is exceedingly\r\n    beautiful; the waves break on the rocks, and the descents are steep\r\n    and rapid. It rained the whole day. We stopped at Mettingen to dine,\r\n    and there surveyed at our ease the horrid and slimy faces of our\r\n    companions in voyage; our only wish was to absolutely annihilate such\r\n    uncleanly animals, to which we might have addressed the boatman's\r\n    speech to Pope: \"'Twere easier for God to make entirely new men than\r\n    attempt to purify such monsters as these.\" After a voyage in the rain,\r\n    rendered disagreeable only by the presence of these loathsome\r\n    \"creepers,\" we arrive, Shelley much exhausted, at Dettingen, our\r\n    resting-place for the night.\r\n\r\nIt never seems to have occurred to them before arriving in Switzerland\r\nthat they had no money wherewith to carry out their further plans, that it\r\nwas more difficult to obtain it abroad than at home, and that the\r\nremainder of their little store would hardly suffice to take them back to\r\nEngland. No sooner thought, however, than done. They gave themselves no\r\nrest after their long and arduous journey, but started straight back via\r\nthe Rhine, arriving in Rotterdam on 8th September with only twenty ecus\r\nremaining, having been \"horribly cheated.\" \"Make arrangements, and talk of\r\nmany things, past, present, and to come.\"\r\n\r\n    _Journal, Friday, September 9._--We have arranged with a captain to\r\n    take us to England--three guineas a-piece; at three o'clock we sail,\r\n    and in the evening arrive at Marsluys, where a bad wind obliges us to\r\n    stay.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, September 10._--We remain at Marsluys, Mary begins _Hate_,\r\n    and gives Shelley the greater pleasure. Shelley writes part of his\r\n    romance. Sleep at Marsluys. Wind contrary.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, September 11._--The wind becomes more favourable. We hear\r\n    that we are to sail. Mary writes more of her _Hate_. We depart, cross\r\n    the bar; the sea is horribly tempestuous, and Mary is nearly sick, nor\r\n    is Shelley much better. There is an easterly gale in the night which\r\n    almost kills us, whilst it carries us nearer our journey's end.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, September 12._--It is calm; we remain on deck nearly the\r\n    whole day. Mary recovers from her sickness. We dispute with one man\r\n    upon the slave trade.\r\n\r\nThe wanderers arrived at last at Gravesend, not only penniless, but unable\r\neven to pay their passage money, or to discharge the hackney coach in\r\nwhich they drove about from place to place in search of assistance. At the\r\ntime of Shelley's sudden flight, the deeds by which part of his income was\r\ntransferred to Harriet were still in preparation only, and he had,\r\nwithout thinking of the consequences of his act, written from Switzerland\r\nto his bankers, directing them to honour her calls for money, as far as\r\nhis account allowed of it. She must have availed herself so well of this\r\npermission that now he found he could only obtain the sum he wanted by\r\napplying for it to her.\r\n\r\nThe relations between Shelley and Harriet, must, at first, have seemed to\r\nMary as incomprehensible as they still do to readers of the _Journal_.\r\nTheir interviews, necessarily very frequent in the next few months, were,\r\non the whole, quite friendly. Shelley was kind and perfectly ingenuous and\r\nsincere; Harriet was sometimes \"civil\" and good tempered, sometimes cross\r\nand provoking. But on neither side was there any pretence of deep pain, of\r\nwounded pride or bitter constraint.\r\n\r\n    _Journal, Tuesday, September 13._--We arrive at Gravesend, and with\r\n    great difficulty prevail on the captain to trust us. We go by boat to\r\n    London; take a coach; call on Hookham. T. H. not at home. C. treats us\r\n    very ill. Call at Voisey's. Henry goes to Harriet. Shelley calls on\r\n    her, whilst poor Mary and Jane are left in the coach for two whole\r\n    hours. Our debt is discharged. Shelley gets clothes for himself. Go to\r\n    Strafford Hotel, dine, and go to bed.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, September 14._--Talk and read the newspaper. Shelley calls\r\n    on Harriet, who is certainly a very odd creature; he writes several\r\n    letters; calls on Hookham, and brings home Wordsworth's _Excursion_,\r\n    of which we read a part, much disappointed. He is a slave. Shelley\r\n    engages lodgings, to which we remove in the evening.\r\n\r\nShelley now lost no time in putting himself in communication with Skinner\r\nStreet, and on the first day after they settled in their new lodgings he\r\naddressed a letter to Godwin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 1814-MAY 1816\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been Godwin's degree of responsibility for the opinions\r\nwhich had enabled Shelley to elope in all good faith with his daughter,\r\nand which saved her from serious scruple in eloping with Shelley, it would\r\nbe impossible not to sympathise with the father's feelings after the\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nPeople do not resent those misfortunes least which they have helped to\r\nbring on themselves, and no one ever derived less consolation from his own\r\ntheories than did Godwin from his, as soon as they were unpleasantly put\r\ninto practice. He had done little to win his daughter's confidence, but he\r\nwas keenly wounded by the proof she had given of its absence. His pride,\r\nas well as his affection, had suffered a serious blow through her\r\ndeparture and that of Jane. For a philosopher like him, accustomed to be\r\nlooked up to and consulted on matters of education, such a failure in his\r\nown family was a public stigma. False and malicious reports got about,\r\nwhich had an additional and peculiar sting from their originating partly\r\nin his well-known impecuniosity. It was currently rumoured that he had\r\nsold the two girls to Shelley for L800 and L700 respectively. No wonder\r\nthat Godwin, accustomed to look down from a lofty altitude on such minor\r\nmatters as money and indebtedness, felt now that he could not hold up his\r\nhead. He shunned his old friends, and they, for the most part, felt this\r\nand avoided him. His home was embittered and spoilt. Mrs. Godwin, incensed\r\nat Jane's conduct, vented her wrath in abuse and invective on Shelley and\r\nMary.\r\n\r\nNo one has thought it worth while to record how poor Fanny was affected by\r\nthe first news of the family calamity. It must have reached her in\r\nIreland, and her subsequent return home was dismal indeed. The loss of her\r\nonly sister was a bitter grief to her; and, strong as was her disapproval\r\nof that sister's conduct, it must have given her a pang to feel that the\r\nculpable Jane had enjoyed Shelley's and Mary's confidence, while she who\r\nloved them with a really unselfish love, had been excluded from it. What\r\ncould she now say or do to cheer Godwin? How parry Mrs. Godwin's\r\ninconsiderate and intemperate complaints and innuendos? No doubt Fanny had\r\noften stood up for Mary with her stepmother, and now Mary herself had cut\r\nthe ground from under her feet.\r\n\r\nCharles Clairmont was at home again; ostensibly on the plea of helping in\r\nthe publishing business, but as a fact idling about, on the lookout for\r\nsome lucky opening. He cared no more than did Jane for the family\r\n(including his own mother) in Skinner Street: like every Clairmont, he\r\nwas an adventurer, and promptly transferred his sympathies to any point\r\nwhich suited himself. To crown all, William, the youngest son, had become\r\ninfected with the spirit of revolt, and had, as Godwin expresses it,\r\n\"eloped for two nights,\" giving his family no little anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe first and immediate result of Shelley's letter to Godwin was _a visit\r\nto his windows_ by Mrs. Godwin and Fanny, who tried in this way to get a\r\nsurreptitious peep at the three truants. Shelley went out to them, but\r\nthey would not speak to him. Late that evening, however, Charles Clairmont\r\nappeared. He was to be another thorn in the side of the interdicted yet\r\nindispensable Shelley. He did not mind having a foot in each camp, and had\r\nno scruples about coming as often and staying as long as he liked, or in\r\nretailing a large amount of gossip. They discussed William's escapade, and\r\nthe various plans for the immuring of Jane, if she could be caught. This\r\ndid not predispose Jane to listen to the overtures subsequently made to\r\nher from time to time by her relatives.\r\n\r\nGodwin replied to Shelley's letter, but declined all further communication\r\nwith him except through a solicitor. Mrs. Godwin's spirit of rancour was\r\nsuch that, several weeks later, she, on one occasion, forbade Fanny to\r\ncome down to dinner because she had received a lock of Mary's hair,\r\nprobably conveyed to her by Charles Clairmont, who, in return, did not\r\nfail to inform Mary of the whole story. In spite, however, of this\r\nvehement show of animosity, Shelley was kept through one channel or\r\nanother only too well informed of Godwin's affairs. Indeed, he was never\r\nsuffered to forget them for long at a time. No sign of impatience or\r\nresentment ever appears in his journal or letters. Not only was Godwin the\r\nfather of his beloved, but he was still, to Shelley, the fountain-head of\r\nwisdom, philosophy, and inspiration. Mary, too, was devoted to her father,\r\nand never wavered in her conviction that his inimical attitude proceeded\r\nfrom no impulse of his own mind, but that he was upheld in it by the\r\ninfluence and interference of Mrs. Godwin.\r\n\r\nThe journal of Shelley and Mary for the next few months is, in its extreme\r\nsimplicity, a curious record of a most uncomfortable time; a medley of\r\nlodgings, lawyers, money-lenders, bailiffs, wild schemes, and literary\r\npursuits. Penniless themselves, they were yet responsible for hundreds and\r\nthousands of pounds of other people's debts; there was Harriet running up\r\nbills at shops and hotels and sending her creditors on to Shelley; Godwin\r\nperpetually threatened with bankruptcy, refusing to see the man who had\r\nrobbed him of his daughter, yet with literally no other hope of support\r\nbut his help; Jane Clairmont now, as for years to come, entirely dependent\r\non them for everything; Shelley's friends quartering themselves on him all\r\nday and every day, often taking advantage of his love of society and\r\nintellectual friction, of Mary's youth and inexperience and compliant\r\ngood-nature, to live at his expense, and, in one case at least, to obtain\r\nfrom him money which he really had not got, and could only borrow, at\r\nruinous interest, on his expectations. He had frequently to be in hiding\r\nfrom bailiffs, change his lodgings, sleep at friends' houses or at\r\ndifferent hotels, getting his letters when he could make a stealthy\r\nappointment to meet Mary, perhaps at St. Paul's, perhaps at some street\r\ncorner or outside some coffee-house,--anywhere where he might escape\r\nobservation. He was not always certain how far he could rely on those whom\r\nhe had considered his friends, such as the brothers Hookham. Rightly or\r\nwrongly, he was led to imagine that Harriet, from motives of revenge, was\r\nbent on ruining Godwin, and that for this purpose she would aid and abet\r\nin his own arrest, by persuading the Hookhams in such a case to refuse\r\nbail. The rumour of this conspiracy was conveyed to the Shelleys in a note\r\nfrom Fanny, who, for Godwin's sake and theirs, broke through the stern\r\nembargo laid on all communication.\r\n\r\nYet through all these troubles and bewilderments there went on a perpetual\r\nunder-current of reading and study, thought and discussion. The actual\r\nexistence was there, and all these external accidents of circumstance, the\r\nrealities in ordinary lives were, in these extraordinary lives, treated\r\nreally as accidents, as passing hindrances to serious purpose, and no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nNothing but Mary's true love for Shelley and perfect happiness with him\r\ncould have tided her over this time. Youth, however, was a wonderful\r\nhelper, added to the unusual intellectual vigour and vivacity which made\r\nit possible for her, as it would be to few girls of seventeen, to forget\r\nthe daily worries of life in reading and study. Perhaps at no time was the\r\neven balance of her nature more clearly manifested than now, when, after\r\nliving through a romance that will last in story as long as the name of\r\nShelley, her existence revolutionised, her sensibilities preternaturally\r\nstimulated, having taken, as it were, a life's experiences by cumulation\r\nin a few months; weak and depressed in health, too, she still had\r\nsufficient energy and self-control to apply herself to a solid course of\r\nintellectual training.\r\n\r\nJane's presence added to their unsettlement, although at times it may have\r\nafforded them some amusement. Wilful, fanciful, with a sense of humour and\r\nmany good impulses, but with that decided dash of charlatanism which\r\ncharacterised the Clairmonts, and little true sensibility, she was a\r\nwilling disciple for any wild flights of fancy, and a keen participator in\r\nall impossible projects and harum-scarum makeshifts. Her presence\r\nstimulated and enlivened Shelley, her whims and fancies did not seriously\r\naffect, beyond amusing him, and she was an indefatigable companion for him\r\nin his walks and wanderings, now that Mary was becoming less and less able\r\nto go about. To Mary, however, she must often have been an incubus, a\r\nperpetual _third_, and one who, if sometimes useful, often gave a great\r\ndeal of trouble too. She did not bring to Mary, as she did to Shelley, the\r\ncharm of novelty; nor does the unfolding of one girl's character present\r\nto another girl whose character is also in process of development such\r\nattractive problems as it does to a young and speculative man. Mary was\r\ntoo noble by nature and too perfectly in accord with Shelley to indulge in\r\nactual jealousy of Jane's companionship with him; still, she must often\r\nhave had a weary time when those two were scouring the town on their\r\nmultifarious errands; misunderstandings, also, would occur, only to be\r\nremoved by long and patient explanation. Jane (or \"Clara,\" as about this\r\ntime she elected to call herself, in preference to her own less romantic\r\nname) was hardly more than a child, and in some respects a very childish\r\nchild. Excitable and nervous, she had no idea of putting constraint upon\r\nherself for others' sake, and gave her neighbours very little rest, as she\r\npreferred any amount of scenes to humdrum quiet. She and Shelley would sit\r\nup half the night, amusing themselves with wild speculations, natural and\r\nsupernatural, till she would go off into hysterics or trances, or, when\r\nshe had at last gone to bed, would walk in her sleep, see phantoms, and\r\nfrighten them all with her terrors. In the end she was invariably brought\r\nto poor Mary, who, delicate in health, had gone early to rest, but had to\r\nbestir herself to bring Jane to reason, and to \"console her with her\r\nall-powerful benevolence,\" as Shelley describes it.\r\n\r\nEvery page of the journal testifies to the extreme youth of the writers;\r\nlikely and unlikely events are chronicled with equal simplicity. Where all\r\nis new, one thing is not more startling than another; and the commonplaces\r\nof everyday life may afford more occasion for surprise than the strangest\r\nanomalies. Specimens only of the diary can be given here, and they are\r\nbest given without comment.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, September 18._--Mary receives her first lesson in Greek. She\r\n    reads the _Curse of Kehama_, while Shelley walks out with Peacock, who\r\n    dines. Shelley walks part of the way home with him. Curious account of\r\n    Harriet. We talk, study a little Greek, and go to bed.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, September 20._--Shelley writes to Hookham and Tavernier;\r\n    goes with Hookham to Ballachy's. Mary reads _Political Justice_ all\r\n    the morning. Study Greek. In the evening Shelley reads _Thalaba_\r\n    aloud.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, September 26._--Shelley goes with Peacock to Ballachy's, and\r\n    engages lodgings at Pancras. Visit from Mrs. Pringer. Read _Political\r\n    Justice_ and the _Empire of the Nairs_.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, September 21._--Read _Political Justice_; finish the\r\n    _Nairs_; pack up and go to our lodgings in Somers Town.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, September 30._--After breakfast walk to Hampstead Heath.\r\n    Discuss the possibility of converting and liberating two heiresses;\r\n    arrange a plan on the subject.... Peacock calls; talk with him\r\n    concerning the heiresses and Marian, arrange his marriage.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, October 2._--Peacock comes after breakfast; walk over\r\n    Primrose Hill; sail little boats; return a little before four; talk.\r\n    Read _Political Justice_ in the evening; talk.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, October 3._--Read _Political Justice_. Hookham calls. Walk\r\n    with Peacock to the Lake of Nangis and set off little fire-boats.\r\n    After dinner talk and let off fireworks. Talk of the west of Ireland\r\n    plan.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, October 5._--Peacock at breakfast. Walk to the Lake of\r\n    Nangis and sail fire-boats. Read _Political Justice_. Shelley reads\r\n    the _Ancient Mariner_ aloud. Letter from Harriet, very civil. L400 for\r\n    L2400.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, October 7_ (Shelley).--Read _Political Justice_. Peacock\r\n    calls. Jane, for some reason, refuses to walk. We traverse the fields\r\n    towards Hampstead. Under an expansive oak lies a dead calf; the cow,\r\n    lean from grief, is watching it. (Contemplate subject for poem.) The\r\n    sunset is beautiful. Return at 9. Peacock departs. Mary goes to bed at\r\n    half-past 8; Shelley sits up with Jane. Talk of oppression and reform,\r\n    of cutting squares of skin from the soldiers' backs. Jane states her\r\n    conception of the subterranean community of women. Talk of Hogg,\r\n    Harriet, Miss Hitchener, etc. At 1 o'clock Shelley observes that it is\r\n    the witching time of night; he inquires soon after if it is not\r\n    horrible to feel the silence of night tingling in our ears; in half an\r\n    hour the question is repeated in a different form; at 2 they retire\r\n    awestruck and hardly daring to breathe. Shelley says to Jane,\r\n    \"Good-night;\" his hand is leaning on the table; he is conscious of an\r\n    expression in his countenance which he cannot repress. Jane hesitates.\r\n    \"Good-night\" again. She still hesitates.\r\n\r\n    \"Did you ever read the tragedy of _Orra_?\" said Shelley.\r\n\r\n    \"Yes. How horribly you look!--take your eyes off.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Good-night\" again, and Jane runs to her room. Shelley, unable to\r\n    sleep, kissed Mary, and prepared to sit beside her and read till\r\n    morning, when rapid footsteps descended the stairs. Jane was there;\r\n    her countenance was distorted most unnaturally by horrible dismay--it\r\n    beamed with a whiteness that seemed almost like light; her lips and\r\n    cheeks were of one deadly hue; the skin of her face and forehead was\r\n    drawn into innumerable wrinkles--the lineaments of terror that could\r\n    not be contained; her hair came prominent and erect; her eyes were\r\n    wide and staring, drawn almost from the sockets by the convulsion of\r\n    the muscles; the eyelids were forced in, and the eyeballs, without any\r\n    relief, seemed as if they had been newly inserted, in ghastly sport,\r\n    in the sockets of a lifeless head. This frightful spectacle endured\r\n    but for a few moments--it was displaced by terror and confusion,\r\n    violent indeed, and full of dismay, but human. She asked me if I had\r\n    touched her pillow (her tone was that of dreadful alarm). I said, \"No,\r\n    no! if you will come into the room I will tell you.\" I informed her\r\n    of Mary's pregnancy; this seemed to check her violence. She told me\r\n    that a pillow placed upon her bed had been removed, in the moment that\r\n    she turned her eyes away to a chair at some distance, and evidently by\r\n    no human power. She was positive as to the facts of her\r\n    self-possession and calmness. Her manner convinced me that she was not\r\n    deceived. We continued to sit by the fire, at intervals engaging in\r\n    awful conversation relative to the nature of these mysteries. I read\r\n    part of _Alexy_; I repeated one of my own poems. Our conversation,\r\n    though intentionally directed to other topics, irresistibly recurred\r\n    to these. Our candles burned low; we feared they would not last until\r\n    daylight. Just as the dawn was struggling with moonlight, Jane\r\n    remarked in me that unutterable expression which had affected her with\r\n    so much horror before; she described it as expressing a mixture of\r\n    deep sadness and conscious power over her. I covered my face with my\r\n    hands, and spoke to her in the most studied gentleness. It was\r\n    ineffectual; her horror and agony increased even to the most dreadful\r\n    convulsions. She shrieked and writhed on the floor. I ran to Mary; I\r\n    communicated in few words the state of Jane. I brought her to Mary.\r\n    The convulsions gradually ceased, and she slept. At daybreak we\r\n    examined her apartment and found her pillow on the chair.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, October 8_ (Mary).--Read _Political Justice_. We walked\r\n    out; when we return Shelley talks with Jane, and I read _Wrongs of\r\n    Women_. In the evening we talk and read.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, October 11._--Read _Political Justice_. Shelley goes to the\r\n    Westminster Insurance Office. Study Greek. Peacock dines. Receive a\r\n    refusal about the money....\r\n\r\n    Have a good-humoured letter from Harriet, and a cold and even\r\n    sarcastic one from Mrs. Boinville. Shelley reads the _History of the\r\n    Illuminati_, out of Barruel, to us.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, October 12._--Read _Political Justice_. A letter from\r\n    Marshall; Jane goes there. When she comes home we go to Cheapside;\r\n    returning, an occurrence. Deliberation until 7; burn the letter; sleep\r\n    early.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, October 13._--Communicate the burning of the letter. Much\r\n    dispute and discussion concerning its probable contents. Alarm.\r\n    Determine to quit London; send for L5 from Hookham. Change our\r\n    resolution. Go to the play. The extreme depravity and disgusting\r\n    nature of the scene; the inefficacy of acting to encourage or maintain\r\n    the delusion. The loathsome sight of men personating characters which\r\n    do not and cannot belong to them. Shelley displeased with what he saw\r\n    of Kean. Return. Alarm. We sleep at the Stratford Hotel.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, October 14_ (Shelley).--Jane's insensibility and incapacity\r\n    for the slightest degree of friendship. The feelings occasioned by\r\n    this discovery prevent me from maintaining any measure in security.\r\n    This highly incorrect; subversion of the first principles of true\r\n    philosophy; characters, particularly those which are unformed, may\r\n    change. Beware of weakly giving way to trivial sympathies. Content\r\n    yourself with one great affection--with a single mighty hope; let the\r\n    rest of mankind be the subjects of your benevolence, your justice,\r\n    and, as human beings, of your sensibility; but, as you value many\r\n    hours of peace, never suffer more than one even to approach the\r\n    hallowed circle. Nothing should shake the truly great spirit which is\r\n    not sufficiently mighty to destroy it.\r\n\r\n    Peacock calls. I take some interest in this man, but no possible\r\n    conduct of his would disturb my tranquillity.... Converse with Jane;\r\n    her mind unsettled; her character unformed; occasion of hope from some\r\n    instances of softness and feeling; she is not entirely insensible to\r\n    concessions, new proofs that the most exalted philosophy, the truest\r\n    virtue, consists in an habitual contempt of self; a subduing of all\r\n    angry feelings; a sacrifice of pride and selfishness. When you attempt\r\n    benefit to either an individual or a community, abstain from imputing\r\n    it as an error that they despise or overlook your virtue. These are\r\n    incidental reflections which arise only indirectly from the\r\n    circumstances recorded.\r\n\r\n    Walk with Peacock to the pond; talk of Marian and Greek metre. Peacock\r\n    dines. In the evening read Cicero and the _Paradoxa_. Night comes;\r\n    Jane walks in her sleep, and groans horribly; listen for two hours; at\r\n    length bring her to Mary. Begin _Julius_, and finish the little volume\r\n    of Cicero.\r\n\r\n    The next morning the chimney board in Jane's room is found to have\r\n    walked leisurely into the middle of the room, accompanied by the\r\n    pillow, who, being very sleepy, tried to get into bed again, but sat\r\n    down on his back.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, October 15_ (Mary).--After breakfast read _Political\r\n    Justice_. Shelley goes with Peacock to Ballachy's. A disappointment;\r\n    it is put off till Monday. They then go to Homerton. Finish _St.\r\n    Leon_. Jane writes to Marshall. A letter from my Father. Talking; Jane\r\n    and I walk out. Shelley and Peacock return at 6. Shelley advises Jane\r\n    not to go. Jane's letter to my Father. A refusal. Talk about going\r\n    away, and, as usual, settle nothing.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, October 19._--Finish _Political Justice_, read _Caleb\r\n    Williams_. Shelley goes to the city, and meets with a total failure.\r\n    Send to Hookham. Shelley reads a part of _Comus_ aloud.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, October 20._--Shelley goes to the city. Finish _Caleb\r\n    Williams_; read to Jane. Peacock calls; he has called on my father,\r\n    who will not speak about Shelley to any one but an attorney. Oh!\r\n    philosophy!...\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, October 22._--Finish the _Life of Alfieri_. Go to the tomb\r\n    (Mary Wollstonecraft's), and read the _Essay on Sepulchres_ there.\r\n    Shelley is out all the morning at the lawyer's, but nothing is\r\n    done....\r\n\r\n    In the evening a letter from Fanny, warning us of the Hookhams. Jane\r\n    and Shelley go after her; they find her, but Fanny runs away.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, October 24._--Read aloud to Jane. At 11 go out to meet\r\n    Shelley. Walk up and down Fleet Street; call at Peacock's; return to\r\n    Fleet Street; call again at Peacock's; return to Pancras; remain an\r\n    hour or two. People call; I suppose bailiffs. Return to Peacock's.\r\n    Call at the coffee-house; see Shelley; he has been to Ballachy's. Good\r\n    hopes; to be decided Thursday morning. Return to Peacock's; dine\r\n    there; get money. Return home in a coach; go to bed soon, tired to\r\n    death.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, October 25._--Write to Shelley. Jane goes to Fanny.... Call\r\n    at Peacock's; go to the hotel; Shelley not there. Go back to\r\n    Peacock's. Peacock goes to Shelley. Meet Shelley in Holborn. Walk up\r\n    and down Bartlett's Buildings.... Come with him to Peacock's; talk\r\n    with him till 10; return to Pancras without him. Jane in the dumps all\r\n    evening about going away.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, October 26._--A visit from Shelley's old friends;[10] they\r\n    go away much disappointed and very angry. He has written to T. Hookham\r\n    to ask him to be bail. Return to Pancras about 4. Read all the\r\n    evening.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, October 27._--Write to Fanny all morning. We had received\r\n    letters from Skinner Street in the morning. Fanny is very doleful, and\r\n    C. C. contradicts in one line what he had said in the line before.\r\n    After two go to St. Paul's; meet Shelley; go with him in a coach to\r\n    Hookham's; H. is out; return; leave him and proceed to Pancras. He has\r\n    not received a definitive answer from Ballachy; meet a money-lender,\r\n    of whom I have some hopes. Read aloud to Jane in the evening. Jane\r\n    goes to sleep. Write to Shelley. A letter comes enclosing a letter\r\n    from Hookham consenting to justify bail. Harriet has been to work\r\n    there against my Father.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, November 1._--Learn Greek all morning. Shelley goes to the\r\n    'Change. Jane calls.[11] People want their money; won't send up\r\n    dinner, and we are all very hungry. Jane goes to Hookham. Shelley and\r\n    I talk about her character. Jane returns without money. Writes to\r\n    Fanny about coming to see her; she can't come. Writes to Charles. Goes\r\n    to Peacock to send him to us with some eatables; he is out. Charles\r\n    promises to see her. She returns to Pancras; he goes there, and tells\r\n    the dismal state of the Skinner Street affairs. Shelley goes to\r\n    Peacock's; comes home with cakes. Wait till T. Hookham sends money to\r\n    pay the bill. Shelley returns to Pancras. Have tea, and go to bed.\r\n    Shelley goes to Peacock's to sleep.\r\n\r\nThese are two specimens of the notes constantly passing between them.\r\n\r\n    MARY TO SHELLEY.\r\n\r\n    _25th October._\r\n\r\n    For what a minute did I see you yesterday. Is this the way, my\r\n    beloved, we are to live till the 6th? In the morning when I wake I\r\n    turn to look on you. Dearest Shelley, you are solitary and\r\n    uncomfortable. Why cannot I be with you, to cheer you and press you to\r\n    my heart? Ah! my love, you have no friends; why, then, should you be\r\n    torn from the only one who has affection for you? But I shall see you\r\n    to-night, and this is the hope I shall live on through the day. Be\r\n    happy, dear Shelley, and think of me! I know how tenderly you love me,\r\n    and how you repine at your absence from me. When shall we be free of\r\n    treachery? I send you the letter I told you of from Harriet, and a\r\n    letter we received yesterday from Fanny; the history of this interview\r\n    I will tell you when I come. I was so dreadfully tired yesterday that\r\n    I was obliged to take a coach home. Forgive this extravagance, but I\r\n    am so very weak at present, and I had been so agitated through the\r\n    day, that I was not able to stand; a morning's rest, however, will set\r\n    me quite right again; I shall be well when I meet you this evening.\r\n    Will you be at the door of the coffee-house at 5 o'clock, as it is\r\n    disagreeable to go into those places. I shall be there exactly at that\r\n    time, and we can go into St. Paul's, where we can sit down.\r\n\r\n    I send you _Diogenes_, as you have no books. Hookham was so\r\n    ill-tempered as not to send the book I asked for. So this is the end\r\n    of my letter, dearest love.\r\n\r\n    What do they mean?[12] I detest Mrs. Godwin; she plagues my father\r\n    out of his life; and these----Well, no matter. Why will Godwin not\r\n    follow the obvious bent of his affections, and be reconciled to us?\r\n    No; his prejudices, the world, and _she_--all these forbid it. What am\r\n    I to do? trust to time, of course, for what else can I do. Good-night,\r\n    my love; to-morrow I will seal this blessing on your lips. Press me,\r\n    your own Mary, to your heart. Perhaps she will one day have a father;\r\n    till then be everything to me, love; and, indeed, I will be a good\r\n    girl, and never vex you. I will learn Greek and----but when shall we\r\n    meet when I may tell you all this, and you will so sweetly reward me?\r\n    But good-night; I am wofully tired, and so sleepy. One kiss--well,\r\n    that is enough--to-morrow!\r\n\r\n\r\n    SHELLEY TO MARY.\r\n\r\n    _28th October._\r\n\r\n    MY BELOVED MARY--I know not whether these transient meetings produce\r\n    not as much pain as pleasure. What have I said? I do not mean it. I\r\n    will not forget the sweet moments when I saw your eyes--the divine\r\n    rapture of the few and fleeting kisses. Yet, indeed, this must cease;\r\n    indeed, we must not part thus wretchedly to meet amid the comfortless\r\n    tumult of business; to part I know not how.\r\n\r\n    Well, dearest love, to-morrow--to-morrow night. That eternal clock!\r\n    Oh! that I could \"fright the steeds of lazy-paced Time.\" I do not\r\n    think that I am less impatient now than formerly to repossess--to\r\n    entirely engross--my own treasured love. It seems so unworthy a cause\r\n    for the slightest separation. I could reconcile it to my own feelings\r\n    to go to prison if they would cease to persecute us with\r\n    interruptions. Would it not be better, my heavenly love, to creep into\r\n    the loathliest cave so that we might be together.\r\n\r\n    Mary, love, we must be united; I will not part from you again after\r\n    Saturday night. We must devise some scheme. I must return. Your\r\n    thoughts alone can waken mine to energy; my mind without yours is dead\r\n    and cold as the dark midnight river when the moon is down. It seems as\r\n    if you alone could shield me from impurity and vice. If I were absent\r\n    from you long, I should shudder with horror at myself; my\r\n    understanding becomes undisciplined without you. I believe I must\r\n    become in Mary's hands what Harriet was in mine. Yet how differently\r\n    disposed--how devoted and affectionate--how, beyond measure,\r\n    reverencing and adoring--the intelligence that governs me! I repent me\r\n    of this simile; it is unjust; it is false. Nor do I mean that I\r\n    consider you much my superior, evidently as you surpass me in\r\n    originality and simplicity of mind. How divinely sweet a task it is to\r\n    imitate each other's excellences, and each moment to become wiser in\r\n    this surpassing love, so that, constituting but one being, all real\r\n    knowledge may be comprised in the maxim [Greek: gnothi seauton]--(know\r\n    thyself)--with infinitely more justice than in its narrow and common\r\n    application. I enclose you Hookham's note; what do you think of it? My\r\n    head aches; I am not well; I am tired with this comfortless\r\n    estrangement from all that is dear to me. My own dearest love,\r\n    good-night. I meet you in Staples Inn at twelve to-morrow--half an\r\n    hour before twelve. I have written to Hooper and Sir J. Shelley.\r\n\r\n    _Journal, Thursday, November 3_ (Mary).--Work; write to Shelley; read\r\n    Greek grammar. Receive a letter from Mr. Booth; so all my hopes are\r\n    over there. Ah! Isabel; I did not think you would act thus. Read and\r\n    work in the evening. Receive a letter from Shelley. Write to him.\r\n\r\n    [Letter not transcribed here.]\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, November 6._--Talk to Shelley. He writes a great heap of\r\n    letters. Read part of _St. Leon_. Talk with him all evening; this is a\r\n    day devoted to Love in idleness. Go to sleep early in the evening.\r\n    Shelley goes away a little before 10.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, November 9._--Pack up all morning; leave Pancras about 3;\r\n    call at Peacock's for Shelley; Charles Clairmont has been for L8. Go\r\n    to Nelson Square. Jane gloomy; she is very sullen with Shelley. Well,\r\n    never mind, my love--we are happy.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, November 10._--Jane is not well, and does not speak the\r\n    whole day. We send to Peacock's, but no good news arrives. Lambert has\r\n    called there, and says he will write. Read a little of _Petronius_, a\r\n    most detestable book. Shelley is out all the morning. In the evening\r\n    read Louvet's _Memoirs_--go to bed early. Shelley and Jane sit up till\r\n    12, talking; Shelley talks her into a good humour.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, November 13._--Write in the morning; very unwell all day.\r\n    Fanny sends a letter to Jane to come to Blackfriars Road; Jane cannot\r\n    go. Fanny comes here; she will not see me; hear everything she says,\r\n    however. They think my letter cold and _indelicate_! God bless them.\r\n    Papa tells Fanny if she sees me he will never speak to her again; a\r\n    blessed degree of liberty this! He has had a very impertinent letter\r\n    from Christy Baxter. The reason she comes is to ask Jane to Skinner\r\n    Street to see Mrs. Godwin, who they say is dying. Jane has no clothes.\r\n    Fanny goes back to Skinner Street to get some. She returns. Jane goes\r\n    with her. Shelley returns (he had been to Hookham's); he disapproves.\r\n    Write and read. In the evening talk with my love about a great many\r\n    things. We receive a letter from Jane saying she is very happy, and\r\n    she does not know when she will return. Turner has called at Skinner\r\n    Street; he says it is too far to Nelson Square. I am unwell in the\r\n    evening.\r\n\r\n    _Journal, November 14_ (Shelley).--Mary is unwell. Receive a note from\r\n    Hogg; cloth from Clara. I wish this girl had a resolute mind. Without\r\n    firmness understanding is impotent, and the truest principles\r\n    unintelligible. Charles calls to confer concerning Lambert; walk with\r\n    him. Go to 'Change, to Peacock's, to Lambert's; receive L30. In the\r\n    evening Hogg calls; perhaps he still may be my friend, in spite of the\r\n    radical differences of sympathy between us; he was pleased with Mary;\r\n    this was the test by which I had previously determined to judge his\r\n    character. We converse on many interesting subjects, and Mary's\r\n    illness disappears for a time.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, November 15_ (Shelley).--Disgusting dreams have occupied\r\n    the night.\r\n\r\n    (Mary).--Very unwell. Jane calls; converse with her. She goes to\r\n    Skinner Street; tells Papa that she will not return; comes back to\r\n    Nelson Square with Shelley; calls at Peacock's. Shelley read aloud to\r\n    us in the evening out of Adolphus's _Lives_.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, November 16._--Very ill all day. Shelley and Jane out all\r\n    day shopping about the town. Shelley reads _Edgar Huntley_ to us.\r\n    Shelley and Jane go to Hookham's. Hogg comes in the meantime; he stops\r\n    all the evening. Shelley writes his critique till half-past 3.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, November 19._--Very ill. Shelley and Jane go out to call at\r\n    Mrs. Knapp's; she receives Jane kindly; promises to come and see me. I\r\n    go to bed early. Charles Clairmont calls in the evening, but I do not\r\n    see him.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, November 20._--Still very ill; get up very late. In the\r\n    evening Shelley reads aloud out of the _Female Revolutionary\r\n    Plutarch_. Hogg comes in the evening.... Get into an argument about\r\n    virtue, in which Hogg makes a sad bungle; quite muddled on the point,\r\n    I perceive.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, November 29._--Work all day. Heigh ho! Clara and Shelley go\r\n    before breakfast to Parker's. After breakfast, Shelley is as badly off\r\n    as I am with my work, for he is out all day with those lawyers. In the\r\n    evening Shelley and Jane go in search of Charles Clairmont; they\r\n    cannot find him. Read _Philip Stanley_--very stupid.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, December 6._--Very unwell. Shelley and Clara walk out, as\r\n    usual, to heaps of places. Read _Agathon_, which I do not like so well\r\n    as _Peregrine_.... A letter from Hookham, to say that Harriet has been\r\n    brought to bed of a son and heir. Shelley writes a number of circular\r\n    letters of this event, which ought to be ushered in with ringing of\r\n    bells, etc., for it is the son _of his wife_. Hogg comes in the\r\n    evening; I like him better, though he vexed me by his attachment to\r\n    sporting. A letter from Harriet confirming the news, in a letter from\r\n    a _deserted wife_!! and telling us he has been born a week.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, December 7._--Clara and Shelley go out together; Shelley\r\n    calls on the lawyers and on Harriet, who treats him with insulting\r\n    selfishness; they return home wet and very tired. Read _Agathon_. I\r\n    like it less to-day; he discovers many opinions which I think\r\n    detestable. Work. In the evening Charles Clairmont comes. Hear that\r\n    Place is trying to raise L1200 to pay Hume on Shelley's _post obit_;\r\n    affairs very bad in Skinner Street; afraid of a call for the rent; all\r\n    very bad. Shelley walks home with Charles Clairmont; goes to Hookham's\r\n    about the L100 to lend my Father. Hookham out. He returns; very tired.\r\n    Work in the evening.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, December 8._--Shelley and Clara go to Hookham's; get the\r\n    L90 for my father; they are out, as usual, all morning. Finish\r\n    _Agathon_. I do not like it; Wieland displays some most detestable\r\n    opinions; he is one of those men who alter all their opinions when\r\n    they are about forty, and then think it will be the same with every\r\n    one, and that they are themselves the only proper monitors of youth.\r\n    Work. When Shelley and Clara return, Shelley goes to Lambert's; out.\r\n    Work. In the evening Hogg comes; talk about a great number of things;\r\n    he is more sincere this evening than I have seen him before. Odd\r\n    dreams.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, December 16._--Still ill; heigh ho! Finish _Jane Talbot_.\r\n    Hume calls at half-past 12; he tells of the great distress in Skinner\r\n    Street; I do not see him. Hookham calls; hasty little man; he does not\r\n    stay long. In the evening Hogg comes. Shelley and Clara are at first\r\n    out; they have been to look for Charles Clairmont; they find him, and\r\n    walk with him some time up and down Ely Place. Shelley goes to sleep\r\n    early; very tired. We talk about flowers and trees in the evening; a\r\n    country conversation.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, December 17._--Very ill. Shelley and Clara go to Pike's;\r\n    when they return, Shelley goes to walk round the Square. Talk with\r\n    Shelley in the evening; he sleeps, and I lie down on the bed. Jane\r\n    goes to Pike's at 9. Charles Clairmont comes, and talks about several\r\n    things. Mrs. Godwin did not allow Fanny to come down to dinner on her\r\n    receiving a lock of my hair. Fanny of course behaves slavishly on the\r\n    occasion. He goes at half-past 11.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, December 18._--Better, but far from well. Pass a very happy\r\n    morning with Shelley. Charles Clairmont comes at dinner-time, the\r\n    Skinner Street folk having gone to dine at the Kennie's. Jane and he\r\n    take a long walk together. Shelley and I are left alone. Hogg comes\r\n    after Clara and her brother return. C. C. flies from the field on his\r\n    approach. Conversation as usual. Get worse towards night.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, December 19_ (Shelley).--Mary rather better this morning.\r\n    Jane goes to Hume's about Godwin's bills; learn that Lambert is\r\n    inclined, but hesitates. Hear of a woman--supposed to be the daughter\r\n    of the Duke of Montrose--who has the head of a hog. _Suetonius_ is\r\n    finished, and Shelley begins the _Historia Augustana_. Charles\r\n    Clairmont comes in the evening; a discussion concerning female\r\n    character. Clara imagines that I treat her unkindly; Mary consoles her\r\n    with her all-powerful benevolence. I rise (having already gone to bed)\r\n    and speak with Clara; she was very unhappy; I leave her tranquil.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, December 20_ (Mary).--Shelley goes to Pike's; take a short\r\n    walk with him first. Unwell. A letter from Harriet, who threatens\r\n    Shelley with her lawyer. In the evening read _Emilia Galotti_. Hogg\r\n    comes. Converse of various things. He goes at twelve.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, December 21_ (Shelley).--Mary is better. Shelley goes to\r\n    Pike's, to the Insurance Offices, and the lawyer's; an agreement\r\n    entered into for L3000 for L1000. A letter from Wales, offering _post\r\n    obit_. Shelley goes to Hume's; Mary reads Miss Baillie's plays in the\r\n    evening. Shelley goes to bed at 8; Mary at 11.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, December 24_ (Mary).--Read _View of French Revolution_.\r\n    Walk out with Shelley, and spend a dreary morning waiting for him at\r\n    Mr. Peacock's. In the evening Hogg comes. I like him better each time;\r\n    it is a pity that he is a lawyer; he wasted so much time on that trash\r\n    that might be spent on better things.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, December 25._--Christmas Day. Have a very bad side-ache in\r\n    the morning, so I rise late. Charles Clairmont comes and dines with\r\n    us. In the afternoon read Miss Baillie's plays. Hogg spends the\r\n    evening with us; conversation, as usual.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, December 26_ (Shelley).--The sweet Maie asleep; leave a note\r\n    with her. Walk with Clara to Pike's, etc. Go to Hampstead and look for\r\n    a house; we return in a return-chaise; find that Laurence has arrived,\r\n    and consult for Mary; she has read Miss Baillie's plays all day. Mary\r\n    better this evening. Shelley very much fatigued; sleeps all the\r\n    evening. Read _Candide_.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, December 27_ (Mary).--Not very well; Shelley very unwell.\r\n    Read _De Montfort_, and talk with Shelley in the evening. Read _View\r\n    of the French Revolution_. Hogg comes in the evening; talk of heaps of\r\n    things. Shelley's odd dream.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, December 28._--Shelley and Clara out all the morning. Read\r\n    _French Revolution_ in the evening. Shelley and I go to Gray's Inn to\r\n    get Hogg; he is not there; go to Arundel Street; can't find him. Go to\r\n    Garnerin's. Lecture on electricity; the gases, and the phantasmagoria;\r\n    return at half-past 9. Shelley goes to sleep. Read _View of French\r\n    Revolution_ till 12; go to bed.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, December 30._--Shelley and Jane go out as usual. Read Bryan\r\n    Edwards's _Account of West Indies_. They do not return till past\r\n    seven, having been locked into Kensington Gardens; both very tired.\r\n    Hogg spends the evening with us.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, December 31_ (Shelley).--The poor Maie was very weak and\r\n    tired all day. Shelley goes to Pike's and Humes' and Mrs.\r\n    Peacock's;[13] return very tired, and sleeps all the evening. The Maie\r\n    goes to sleep early. New Year's Eve.\r\n\r\nIn January 1815 Shelley's grandfather, Sir Bysshe, died, and his father,\r\nMr. Timothy Shelley, succeeded to the baronetcy and estate. By an\r\narrangement with his father, according to which he relinquished all claim\r\non a certain portion of his patrimony, Shelley now became possessed of\r\nL1000 a year (L200 a year of which he at once set apart for Harriet), as\r\nwell as a considerable sum of ready money for the relief of his present\r\nnecessities. L200 of this he also sent to Harriet to pay her debts. The\r\nnext few entries in the journal were, however, written before this event.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, January 5_ (Mary).--Go to breakfast at Hogg's; Shelley\r\n    leaves us there and goes to Hume's. When he returns we go to Newman\r\n    Street; see the statue of Theoclea; it is a divinity that raises your\r\n    mind to all virtue and excellence; I never beheld anything half so\r\n    wonderfully beautiful. Return home very ill. Expect Hogg in the\r\n    evening, but he does not come. Too ill to read.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, January 6._--Walk to Mrs. Peacock's with Clara. Walk with\r\n    Hogg to Theoclea; she is ten thousand times more beautiful to-day than\r\n    ever; tear ourselves away. Return to Nelson Square; no one at home.\r\n    Hogg stays a short time with me. Shelley had stayed at home till 2 to\r\n    see Ryan;[14] he does not come. Goes out about business. In the\r\n    evening Shelley and Clara go to Garnerin's.... Very unwell. Hogg\r\n    comes. Shelley and Clara return at ten. Conversation as usual. Shelley\r\n    reads \"Ode to France\" aloud, and repeats the poem to \"Tranquillity.\"\r\n    Talk with Shelley afterwards for some time; at length go to sleep.\r\n    Shelley goes out and sits in the other room till 5; I then call him.\r\n    Talk. Shelley goes to sleep; at 8 Shelley rises and goes out.\r\n\r\nThe next entry is made during Shelley's short absence in Sussex, after his\r\ngrandfather's death. Clara had accompanied him on his journey.\r\n\r\n    _(Date between January 7 and January 13)._--Letter from Peacock to say\r\n    that he is in prison.... His debt is L40.... Write to Peacock and\r\n    send him L2. Hogg dines with me and spends the evening; letter from\r\n    Hookham.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, January 13._--A letter from Clara. While I am at breakfast\r\n    Shelley and Clara arrive. The will has been opened, and Shelley is\r\n    referred to Whitton. His father would not allow him to enter Field\r\n    Place; he sits before the door and reads _Comus_. Dr. Blocksome comes\r\n    out; tells him that his father is very angry with him. Sees my name in\r\n    Milton.... Hogg dines, and spends the evening with us.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, January 24._--In the evening Shelley, Clara, and Hogg sleep.\r\n    Read Gibbon.... Hogg goes at half-past 11. Shelley and Clara explain\r\n    as usual.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, January 30._--Work all day. Shelley reads Livy. In the\r\n    evening Shelley reads _Paradise Regained_ aloud, and then goes to\r\n    sleep. Hogg comes at 9. Talk and work. Hogg sleeps here.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, February 1._--Read Gibbon (end of vol. i.) Shelley reads\r\n    Livy in the evening. Work. Shelley and Clara sleep. Hogg comes and\r\n    sleeps here. Mrs. Hill calls.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, February 5._--Read Gibbon. Take a long walk in Kensington\r\n    Gardens and the Park; meet Clairmont as we return, and hear that my\r\n    father wishes to see a copy of the codicil, because he thinks Shelley\r\n    is acting rashly. All this is very odd and inconsistent, but I never\r\n    quarrel with inconsistency; folks must change their minds. After\r\n    dinner talk. Shelley finishes Gibbon's _Memoirs_ aloud. Clara,\r\n    Shelley, and Hogg sleep. Read Gibbon. Shelley writes to Longdill and\r\n    Clairmont. Hogg ill, but we cannot persuade him to stay; he goes at\r\n    half-past 11.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, February 8._--Ash Wednesday. So Hogg stays all day. We are\r\n    to move to-day, so Shelley and Clara go out to look for lodgings. Hogg\r\n    and I pack, and then talk. Shelley and Clara do not return till 3;\r\n    they have not succeeded; go out again; they get apartments at Hans\r\n    Place; move. In the evening talk and read Gibbon. Letters. Pike calls;\r\n    insolent plague. Hogg goes at half-past 11.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, February 14_ (Shelley).--Shelley goes to Longdill's and\r\n    Hayward's, and returns feverish and fatigued. Maie finishes the third\r\n    volume of Gibbon. All unwell in the evening. Hogg comes and puts us to\r\n    bed. Hogg goes at half-past 11.\r\n\r\nIn this month, probably on the 22d (but that page of the diary is torn),\r\nwhen they had been hardly more than a week in their last new lodgings, a\r\nlittle girl was born. Although her confinement was premature, Mary had a\r\nfavourable time; the infant, a scarcely seven months' child, was not\r\nexpected to live; it survived, however, for some days. It might possibly\r\nhave been saved, had it had an ordinary chance of life given it, but, on\r\nthe ninth day of its existence, the whole family moved yet again to new\r\nlodgings. How the young mother ever recovered from the fatigues, risks,\r\nand worries she had to go through at this critical time may well be\r\nwondered. It is more than probable that the unreasonable demands made on\r\nher strength and courage during this month and those which preceded it\r\nlaid the foundation of much weak health later on. The child was\r\nsacrificed. Four days after the move it was found in the morning dead by\r\nits mother's side. The poor little thing was a mere passing episode in\r\nShelley's troubled, hurried existence. Only to Mary were its birth and\r\ndeath a deep and permanent experience. Apart from her love for Shelley,\r\nher affections had been chiefly of the intellectual kind, and even in her\r\nrelation with him mental affinity had played a great part. A new chord in\r\nher temperament was set vibrating by the advent of this baby, the maternal\r\none, quite absent from her disposition before, and which was to assert\r\nitself at last as the keynote of her nature.\r\n\r\nHogg, who was almost constantly with them at this time, seems to have been\r\nkind, helpful, and sympathetic.\r\n\r\nThe baby's birth was too much for Fanny Godwin's endurance and fortitude.\r\nUp to this time she had, in accordance with what she conceived to be her\r\nduty, held aloof from the Shelleys, but, the barrier once broken down, she\r\ncame repeatedly to see them. Mrs. Godwin showed that she had a soft spot\r\nin her heart by sending Mary, through Fanny, a present of linen, no doubt\r\nmost welcome at this unprepared-for crisis. Beyond this she was\r\nunrelenting. Her pride, however, was not so strong as her feminine\r\ncuriosity, which she indulged still by parading before the windows and\r\ntrying to get peeps at the people behind them. She was annoyed with Fanny,\r\nwho now, however, held her own course, feeling that her duty could not be\r\nall on one side while her family consented to be dependent, and that every\r\nmoment of her father's peace and safety were due entirely to this Shelley\r\nwhom he would not see.\r\n\r\n    _Journal, February 22_ (Shelley) (after the baby's birth).--Maie\r\n    perfectly well and at ease. The child is not quite seven months; the\r\n    child not expected to live. Shelley sits up with Maie, much exhausted\r\n    and agitated. Hogg sleeps here.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, February 23._--Mary quite well; the child unexpectedly\r\n    alive, but still not expected to live. Hogg returns in the evening at\r\n    half-past 7. Shelley writes to Fanny requesting her to come and see\r\n    Maie. Fanny comes and remains the whole night, the Godwins being\r\n    absent from home. Charles comes at 11 with linen from Mrs. Godwin.\r\n    Hogg departs at 11. L30 from Longdill.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, February 24._--Maie still well; favourable symptoms in the\r\n    child; we may indulge some hopes. Hogg calls at 2. Fanny departs. Dr.\r\n    Clarke calls; confirms our hopes of the child. Shelley finishes second\r\n    volume of Livy, p. 657. Hogg comes in the evening. Shelley very unwell\r\n    and exhausted.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, February 25._--The child very well; Maie very well also;\r\n    drawing milk all day. Shelley is very unwell.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, February 26_ (Mary).--Maie rises to-day. Hogg comes; talk;\r\n    she goes to bed at 6. Hogg calls at the lodgings we have taken. Read\r\n    _Corinne_. Shelley and Clara go to sleep. Hogg returns; talk with him\r\n    till past 11. He goes. Shelley and Clara go down to tea. Just settling\r\n    to sleep when a knock comes to the door; it is Fanny; she came to see\r\n    how we were; she stays talking till half-past 3, and then leaves the\r\n    room that Shelley and Mary may sleep. Shelley has a spasm.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, February 27._--Rise; talk and read _Corinne_. Hogg comes in\r\n    the evening. Shelley and Clara go out about a cradle....\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, February 28._--I come downstairs; talk, nurse the baby, read\r\n    _Corinne_, and work. Shelley goes to Pemberton about his health.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, March 1._--Nurse the baby, read _Corinne_, and work.\r\n    Shelley and Clara out all morning. In the evening Peacock comes. Talk\r\n    about types, editions, and Greek letters all the evening. Hogg comes.\r\n    They go away at half-past 11. Bonaparte invades France.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, March 2._--A bustle of moving. Read _Corinne_. I and my\r\n    baby go about 3. Shelley and Clara do not come till 6. Hogg comes in\r\n    the evening.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, March 3._--Nurse my baby; talk, and read _Corinne_. Hogg\r\n    comes in the evening.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, March 4._--Read, talk, and nurse. Shelley reads the _Life\r\n    of Chaucer_. Hogg comes in the evening and sleeps.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, March 5._--Shelley and Clara go to town. Hogg here all day.\r\n    Read _Corinne_ and nurse my baby. In the evening talk. Shelley\r\n    finishes the _Life of Chaucer_. Hogg goes at 11.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, March 6._--Find my baby dead. Send for Hogg. Talk. A\r\n    miserable day. In the evening read _Fall of the Jesuits_. Hogg sleeps\r\n    here.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, March 7._--Shelley and Clara go after breakfast to town.\r\n    Write to Fanny. Hogg stays all day with us; talk with him, and read\r\n    the _Fall of the Jesuits_ and _Rinaldo Rinaldini_. Not in good\r\n    spirits. Hogg goes at 11. A fuss. To bed at 3.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, March 8._--Finish _Rinaldini_. Talk with Shelley. In very\r\n    bad spirits, but get better; sleep a little in the day. In the evening\r\n    net. Hogg comes; he goes at half-past 11. Clara has written for Fanny,\r\n    but she does not come.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, March 9._--Read and talk. Still think about my little baby.\r\n    'Tis hard, indeed, for a mother to lose a child. Hogg and Charles\r\n    Clairmont come in the evening. C. C. goes at 11. Hogg stays all night.\r\n    Read Fontenelle, _Plurality of Worlds_.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, March 10._--Hogg's holidays begin. Shelley, Hogg, and Clara\r\n    go to town. Hogg comes back soon. Talk and net. Hogg now remains with\r\n    us. Put the room to rights.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, March 11._--Very unwell. Hogg goes to town. Talk about\r\n    Clara's going away; nothing settled; I fear it is hopeless. She will\r\n    not go to Skinner Street; then our house is the only remaining place,\r\n    I see plainly. What is to be done? Hogg returns. Talk, and Hogg reads\r\n    the _Life of Goldoni_ aloud.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, March 4._--Talk a great deal. Not well, but better. Very\r\n    quiet all the morning, and happy, for Clara does not get up till 4. In\r\n    the evening read Gibbon, fourth volume; go to bed at 12.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, March 13._--Shelley and Clara go to town. Stay at home; net,\r\n    and think of my little dead baby. This is foolish, I suppose; yet,\r\n    whenever I am left alone to my own thoughts, and do not read to divert\r\n    them, they always come back to the same point--that I was a mother,\r\n    and am so no longer. Fanny comes, wet through; she dines, and stays\r\n    the evening; talk about many things; she goes at half-past 9. Cut out\r\n    my new gown.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, March 14._--Shelley calls on Dr. Pemberton. Net till\r\n    breakfast. Shelley reads _Religio Medici_ aloud, after Hogg has gone\r\n    to town. Work; finish Hogg's purse. Shelley and I go upstairs and talk\r\n    of Clara's going; the prospect appears to me more dismal than ever;\r\n    not the least hope. This is, indeed, hard to bear. In the evening Hogg\r\n    reads Gibbon to me. Charles Clairmont comes in the evening.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, March 19._--Dream that my little baby came to life again;\r\n    that it had only been cold, and that we rubbed it before the fire, and\r\n    it lived. Awake and find no baby. I think about the little thing all\r\n    day. Not in good spirits. Shelley is very unwell. Read Gibbon. Charles\r\n    Clairmont comes. Hogg goes to town till dinner-time. Talk with Charles\r\n    Clairmont about Skinner Street. They are very badly off there. I am\r\n    afraid nothing can be done to save them. C. C. says that he shall go\r\n    to America; this I think a rather wild project in the Clairmont style.\r\n    Play a game of chess with Clara. In the evening Shelley and Hogg play\r\n    at chess. Shelley and Clara walk part of the way with Charles\r\n    Clairmont. Play chess with Hogg, and then read Gibbon.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, March 20._--Dream again about my baby. Work after breakfast,\r\n    and then go with Shelley, Hogg, and Clara to Bullock's Museum; spend\r\n    the morning there. Return and find more letters for A. Z.--one from a\r\n    \"Disconsolate Widow.\"[15]\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, March 22._--Talk, and read the papers. Read Gibbon all\r\n    day. Charles Clairmont calls about Shelley lending L100. We do not\r\n    return a decisive answer.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, March 23._--Read Gibbon. Shelley reads Livy. Walk with\r\n    Shelley and Hogg to Arundel Street. Read _Le Diable Boiteux_. Hear\r\n    that Bonaparte has entered Paris. As we come home, meet my father and\r\n    Charles Clairmont.... C. C. calls; he tells us that Papa saw us, and\r\n    that he remarked that Shelley was so beautiful, it was a pity he was\r\n    so wicked.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, March 28._--Work in the morning and then walk out to look at\r\n    house.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, April 8._--Peacock comes at breakfast-time; Hogg and he go\r\n    to town. Read _L'Esprit des Nations_. Settle to go to Virginia Water.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, April 9._--Rise at 8. Charles Clairmont comes to breakfast at\r\n    10. Read some lines of Ovid before breakfast; after, walk with\r\n    Shelley, Hogg, Clara, and C. C. to pond in Kensington Gardens; return\r\n    about 2. C. C. goes to Skinner Street. Read Ovid with Hogg (finish\r\n    second fable). Shelley reads Gibbon and _Pastor Fido_ with Clara. In\r\n    the evening read _L'Esprit des Nations_. Shelley reads Gibbon, _Pastor\r\n    Fido_, and the story of Myrrha in Ovid.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, April 10._--Read Voltaire before breakfast. After breakfast\r\n    work. Shelley passes the morning with Harriet, who is in a\r\n    surprisingly good humour. Mary reads third fable of Ovid: Shelley and\r\n    Clara read _Pastor Fido_. Shelley reads Gibbon. Mrs. Godwin after\r\n    dinner parades before the windows. Talk in the evening with Hogg\r\n    about mountains and lakes and London.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, April 11._--Work in the morning. Receive letters from\r\n    Skinner Street to say that Mamma had gone away in the pet, and had\r\n    stayed out all night. Read fourth and fifth fables of Ovid.... After\r\n    tea, work. Charles Clairmont comes.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, April 15._--Read Ovid till 3. Shelley and Clara finish\r\n    _Pastor Fido_, and then go out about Clara's lottery ticket; draws.\r\n    Clara's ticket comes up a prize. She buys two desks after dinner. Read\r\n    Ovid (ninety-five lines). Shelley and Clara begin _Orlando Furioso_. A\r\n    very grim dream.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, April 21._--After breakfast go with Shelley to Peacock's.\r\n    Shelley goes to Longdill's. Read third canto of the _Lord of the\r\n    Isles_. Return about 2. Shelley goes to Harriet to procure his son,\r\n    who is to appear in one of the courts. After dinner look over W. W.'s\r\n    poems. After tea read forty lines of Ovid. Fanny comes and gives us an\r\n    account of Hogan's threatened arrest of my Father. Shelley walks home\r\n    part of the way with her. Very sleepy. Shelley reads one canto of\r\n    Ariosto.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, April 22._--Read a little of Ovid. Shelley goes to\r\n    Harriet's about his son. Work. Fanny comes. Shelley returns at 4; he\r\n    has been much teased with Harriet. He has been to Longdill's,\r\n    Whitton's, etc., and at length has got a promise that he shall appear\r\n    Monday. After dinner Fanny goes. Read sixty lines of Ovid. Shelley and\r\n    Clara read to the middle of the fourteenth canto of Ariosto.\r\n\r\nShortly after this several leaves of the journal are lost.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, May 5._--After breakfast to Marshall's,[16] but do not see\r\n    him. Go to the Tomb. Shelley goes to Longdill's. Return soon. Read\r\n    Spenser; construe Ovid.... After dinner talk with Shelley; then\r\n    Shelley and Clara go out....

Construe Ovid (90\r\n    lines); read Spenser. Jefferson returns at half-past 4, and tells us\r\n    that poor Sawyer is to be hung. These blessed laws! After dinner read\r\n    Spenser.

She had never shown any\r\nvery great desire to go back to her family in Skinner Street, but even had\r\nit been otherwise, objections had now been raised to her presence there\r\nwhich made her return difficult if not impossible. Fanny Godwin's aunts,\r\nEverina Wollstonecraft and Mrs. Bishop, were Principals of a select\r\nLadies' School in Dublin, and intended that, on their own retirement,\r\ntheir niece should succeed them in its management. They strongly objected\r\nnow to her associating with Miss Clairmont, pointing out that, even if her\r\nmorals were not injured, her professional prospects must be marred by the\r\nfact being generally known of her connection and companionship with a girl\r\nwho undoubtedly had run away from home, and who was, untruly but not\r\ngroundlessly, reported to be concerned in a notorious scandal.\r\n\r\nHer continued presence in the Shelley household, a thing probably never\r\ncontemplated at the time of their hurried flight, was manifestly\r\nundesirable, on many grounds. To Mary it was a perpetual trial, and must,\r\nin the end, have tended towards disagreement between her and Shelley,\r\nwhile it put Clara herself at great and unjust social disadvantage. Not\r\nthat she heeded that, or regretted the barrier that divided her from\r\nSkinner Street, where poverty and anxiety and gloom reigned paramount, and\r\nwhere she would have been watched with ceaseless and unconcealed\r\nsuspicion. She had heard that her relations had even discussed the\r\nadvisability of immuring her in a convent if she could be caught,--but she\r\ndid not mean to be caught. She advertised for a situation as companion;\r\nnothing, however, came of this. An idea of sending her to board in the\r\nfamily of a Mrs. Knapp seems to have been entertained for some months both\r\nby Godwins and Shelleys, Charles Clairmont probably acting as a medium\r\nbetween the two households. But, after appearing well disposed at first,\r\nMrs. Knapp thought better of the plan. She did not want, and would not\r\nhave Clara. The final project, that of the Lynmouth lodgings, was a sudden\r\nidea, suddenly carried out, and devised with the Shelleys independently\r\nof the Godwins, who were not consulted, nor even informed, until it had\r\nbeen put into execution. So much is to be gathered from the letter which\r\nClara wrote to Fanny a fortnight after her arrival.\r\n\r\n    CLARA TO FANNY.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, 28th May 1815._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR FANNY--Mary writes me that you thought me unkind in not\r\n    letting you know before my departure; indeed, I meant no unkindness,\r\n    but I was afraid if I told you that it might prevent my putting a plan\r\n    into execution which I preferred before all the Mrs. Knapps in the\r\n    world. Here I am at liberty; there I should have been under a\r\n    perpetual restraint. Mrs. Knapp is a forward, impertinent, superficial\r\n    woman. Here there are none such; a few cottages, with little,\r\n    rosy-faced children, scolding wives, and drunken husbands. I wish I\r\n    had a more amiable and romantic picture to present to you, such as\r\n    shepherds and shepherdesses, flocks and madrigals; but this is the\r\n    truth, and the truth is best at all times. I live in a little cottage,\r\n    with jasmine and honeysuckle twining over the window; a little\r\n    downhill garden full of roses, with a sweet arbour. There are only two\r\n    gentlemen's seats here, and they are both absent. The walks and\r\n    shrubberies are quite open, and are very delightful. Mr. Foote's\r\n    stands at top of the hill, and commands distant views of the whole\r\n    country. A green tottering bridge, flung from rock to rock, joins his\r\n    garden to his house, and his side of the bridge is a waterfall. One\r\n    tumbles directly down, and then flows gently onward, while the other\r\n    falls successively down five rocks, and seems like water running down\r\n    stone steps. I will tell you, so far, that it is a valley I live in,\r\n    and perhaps one you may have seen. Two ridges of mountains enclose the\r\n    village, which is situated at the west end. A river, which you may\r\n    step over, runs at the foot of the mountains, and trees hang so\r\n    closely over, that when on a high eminence you sometimes lose sight of\r\n    it for a quarter of a mile. One ridge of hills is entirely covered\r\n    with luxuriant trees, the opposite line is entirely bare, with long\r\n    pathways of slate and gray rocks, so that you might almost fancy they\r\n    had once been volcanic. Well, enough of the valleys and the mountains.\r\n\r\n    You told me you did not think I should ever be able to live alone. If\r\n    you knew my constant tranquillity, how cheerful and gay I am, perhaps\r\n    you would alter your opinion. I am perfectly happy. After so much\r\n    discontent, such violent scenes, such a turmoil of passion and hatred,\r\n    you will hardly believe how enraptured I am with this dear little\r\n    quiet spot. I am as happy when I go to bed as when I rise. I am never\r\n    disappointed, for I know the extent of my pleasures; and let it rain\r\n    or let it be fair weather, it does not disturb my serene mood. This is\r\n    happiness; this is that serene and uninterrupted rest I have long\r\n    wished for. It is in solitude that the powers concentre round the\r\n    soul, and teach it the calm, determined path of virtue and wisdom. Did\r\n    you not find this--did you not find that the majestic and tranquil\r\n    mountains impressed deep and tranquil thoughts, and that everything\r\n    conspired to give a sober temperature of mind, more truly delightful\r\n    and satisfying than the gayest ebullitions of mirth?\r\n\r\n      The foaming cataract and tall rock\r\n          Haunt me like a passion.\r\n\r\n    Now for a little chatting. I was quite delighted to hear that Papa had\r\n    at last got L1000. Riches seem to fly from genius. I suppose, for a\r\n    month or two, you will be easy--pray be cheerful. I begin to think\r\n    there is no situation without its advantages. You may learn wisdom and\r\n    fortitude in adversity, and in prosperity you may relieve and soothe.\r\n    I feel anxious to be wise; to be capable of knowing the best; of\r\n    following resolutely, however painful, what mature and serious thought\r\n    may prescribe; and of acquiring a prompt and vigorous judgment, and\r\n    powers capable of execution. What are you reading? Tell Charles, with\r\n    my best love, that I will never forgive him for having disappointed\r\n    me of Wordsworth, which I miss very much. Ask him, likewise, to lend\r\n    me his Coleridge's poems, which I will take great care of. How is dear\r\n    Willy? How is every one? If circumstances get easy, don't you think\r\n    Papa and Mamma will go down to the seaside to get up their health a\r\n    little? Write me a very long letter, and tell me everything. How is\r\n    your health? Now do not be melancholy; for heaven's sake be cheerful;\r\n    so young in life, and so melancholy! The moon shines in at my window,\r\n    there is a roar of waters, and the owls are hooting. How often do I\r\n    not wish for a curfew!--\"swinging slow with sullen roar!\" Pray write\r\n    to me. Do, there's a good Fanny.--Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n      M. J. CLAIRMONT.\r\n\r\n    Miss Fanny Godwin,\r\n    41 Skinner Street, Snow Hill, London.\r\n\r\nHow long this delightful life of solitude lasted is not exactly known. For\r\na year after this time both Clara's journal and that of Shelley and Mary\r\nare lost, and the next thing we hear of Clara is her being in town in the\r\nspring of 1816, when she first made Lord Byron's acquaintance.\r\n\r\nMary, at any rate, enjoyed nearly a year of comparative peace and\r\n_tete-a-tete_ with Shelley, which, after all she had gone through, must\r\nhave been happiness indeed. Had she known that it was the only year she\r\nwould ever pass with him without the presence of a third person, it may be\r\nthat--although her loyalty to Shelley stood every test--her heart might\r\nhave sunk within her. But, happily for her, she could not foresee this.\r\nHer letter from Clifton shows that Clara's shadow haunted her at times.\r\nStill she was happy, and at peace. Her health, too, was better; and,\r\nthough always weighed down by Godwin's anxieties, she and Shelley were,\r\nthemselves, free for once from the pinch of actual penury and the\r\nperpetual fear of arrest.\r\n\r\nIn June they made a tour in South Devon, and very probably paid Clara a\r\nvisit in her rural retirement; after which Mary stayed for some time at\r\nClifton, while Shelley travelled about looking for a country house to suit\r\nthem. It was during one of his absences that Mary wrote to him the letter\r\nreferred to above.\r\n\r\n    MARY TO SHELLEY.\r\n\r\n    CLIFTON, _27th July 1815_.\r\n\r\n    MY BELOVED SHELLEY--What I am now going to say is not a freak from a\r\n    fit of low spirits, but it is what I earnestly entreat you to attend\r\n    to and comply with.\r\n\r\n    We ought not to be absent any longer; indeed we ought not. I am not\r\n    happy at it. When I retire to my room, no sweet love; after dinner, no\r\n    Shelley; though I have heaps of things _very particular_ to say; in\r\n    fine, either you must come back, or I must come to you directly. You\r\n    will say, shall we neglect taking a house--a dear home? No, my love, I\r\n    would not for worlds give up that; but I know what seeking for a house\r\n    is, and, trust me, it is a very, _very_ long job, too long for one\r\n    love to undertake in the absence of the other. Dearest, I know how it\r\n    will be; we shall both of us be put off, day after day, with the hopes\r\n    of the success of the next day's search, for I am frightened to think\r\n    how long. Do you not see it in this light, my own love? We have been\r\n    now a long time separated, and a house is not yet in sight; and even\r\n    if you should fix on one, which I do not hope for in less than a\r\n    week, then the settling, etc. Indeed, my love, I cannot bear to remain\r\n    so long without you; so, if you will not give me leave, expect me\r\n    without it some day; and, indeed, it is very likely that you may, for\r\n    I am quite sick of passing day after day in this hopeless way.\r\n\r\n    Pray, is Clara with you? for I have inquired several times and no\r\n    letters; but, seriously, it would not in the least surprise me, if you\r\n    have written to her from London, and let her know that you are without\r\n    me, that she should have taken some such freak.\r\n\r\n    The Dormouse has hid the brooch; and, pray, why am I for ever and ever\r\n    to be denied the sight of my case? Have you got it in your own\r\n    possession? or where is it? It would give me very great pleasure if\r\n    you would send it me. I hope you have not already appropriated it, for\r\n    if you have I shall think it un-Pecksie of you, as Maie was to give it\r\n    you with her own hands on your birthday; but it is of little\r\n    consequence, for I have no hope of seeing you on that day; but I am\r\n    mistaken, for I have hope and certainty, for if you are not here on or\r\n    before the 3d of August, I set off on the 4th, in early coach, so as\r\n    to be with you in the evening of that dear day at least.\r\n\r\n    To-morrow is the 28th of July. Dearest, ought we not to have been\r\n    together on that day? Indeed we ought, my love, as I shall shed some\r\n    tears to think we are not. Do not be angry, dear love; your Pecksie is\r\n    a good girl, and is quite well now again, except a headache, when she\r\n    waits so anxiously for her love's letters.\r\n\r\n    Dearest, best Shelley, pray come to me; pray, pray do not stay away\r\n    from me! This is delightful weather, and you better, we might have a\r\n    delightful excursion to Tintern Abbey. My dear, dear love, I most\r\n    earnestly, and with tearful eyes, beg that I may come to you if you do\r\n    not like to leave the searches after a house.\r\n\r\n    It is a long time to wait, even for an answer. To-morrow may bring you\r\n    news, but I have no hope, for you only set off to look after one in\r\n    the afternoon, and what can be done at that hour of the day? You\r\n    cannot.\r\n\r\nThey finally settled on a house at Bishopsgate just outside Windsor Park,\r\nwhere they passed several months of tranquillity and comparative health;\r\nperhaps the most peacefully happy time that Shelley had ever known or was\r\never to know. Shadows he, too, had to haunt him, but he was young, and the\r\nreaction from the long-continued strain of anxiety, fear, discomfort, and\r\nill-health was so strong that it is no wonder if he yielded himself up to\r\nits influence. The summer was warm and dry, and most of the time was\r\npassed out of doors. They visited the source of the Thames, making the\r\nvoyage in a wherry from Windsor to Cricklade. Charles Clairmont was of the\r\nparty, and Peacock also, who gives a humorous account of the expedition,\r\nand of the cure he effected of Shelley's ailments by his prescription of\r\n\"three mutton chops, well peppered.\" Shelley was at this time a strict\r\nvegetarian. Mary, Peacock says, kept a diary of the excursion, which,\r\nhowever, has been lost. Shelley's \"Stanzas in the churchyard of Lechlade\"\r\nwere an enduring memento of the occasion. At Bishopsgate, under the oak\r\nshades of Windsor Great Park, he composed _Alastor_, the first mature\r\nproduction of his genius, and at Bishopsgate Mary's son William was born,\r\non 24th January 1816.\r\n\r\nThe list of books read during 1815 by Shelley and Mary is worth\r\nappending, as giving some idea of their wonderful mental activity and\r\ninsatiable thirst for knowledge, and the singular sympathy which existed\r\nbetween them in these intellectual pursuits.\r\n\r\n  LIST OF BOOKS READ IN 1815.\r\n\r\n  MARY.\r\n\r\n  _Those marked * Shelley read also._\r\n\r\n    Posthumous Works. 3 vols.\r\n    Sorrows of Werter.\r\n    Don Roderick.

As usual, the first\r\ndisturbing cause was Clara Clairmont. Early in 1816 she was in town,\r\npossibly with her brother Charles, with whom she kept up correspondence,\r\nand with whom (thanks to funds provided by Shelley) she had in the autumn\r\nbeen travelling, or paying visits. She now started one of her \"wild\r\nprojects in the Clairmont style,\" which brought as its consequence the\r\novershadowing of her whole life. She thought she would like to go on the\r\nstage, and she applied to Lord Byron, then connected with the management\r\nof Drury Lane Theatre, for some theatrical employment. The fascination of\r\nByron's poetry, joined to his very shady social reputation, surrounded him\r\nwith a kind of romantic mystery highly interesting to a wayward, audacious\r\nyoung spirit, attracted by anything that excited its curiosity. Clara\r\nnever went on the stage. But she became Byron's mistress. Their connection\r\nlasted but a short time. Byron quickly tired of her, and when importuned\r\nwith her or her affairs, soon came to look on her with positive antipathy.\r\nNothing in Clara's letters to him[17] goes to prove that she was very\r\ndeeply in love with him. The episode was an excitement and an adventure:\r\none, to him, of the most trivial nature, but fraught with tragic indirect\r\nresults to her, and, through her, to the Shelleys. They, although they\r\nknew of her acquaintance with Byron, were in complete and unsuspecting\r\nignorance of its intimate nature. It might have been imagined that Clara\r\nwould confide in them, and would even rejoice in doing so. But she had, on\r\nthe contrary, a positive horror and dread of their finding out anything\r\nabout her secret. She told Byron who Mary was, one evening when she knew\r\nthey were to meet, but implored him beforehand to talk only on general\r\nsubjects, and, if possible, not even to mention her name.\r\n\r\nThis introduction probably took place in March, when Shelley and Mary\r\nwere, for a short time, staying up in town. Shelley was occupied in\r\ntransacting business, which had reference, as usual, to Godwin's affairs.\r\nA suit in Chancery was proceeding, to enable him to sell, to his father,\r\nthe reversion of a portion of his estates. Short of obtaining this\r\npermission, he could not assist Godwin to the full extent demanded and\r\nexpected by this latter, who chose to say, and was encouraged by his man\r\nof business to think that, if Shelley did not get the money, it was owing\r\nto slackness of effort or inclination on his part. The suit was, however,\r\nfinally decided against Shelley. The correspondence between him and Godwin\r\nwas painful in the highest degree, and must have embittered Mary's\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nGodwin, while leaving no stone unturned to get as much of Shelley's money\r\nas possible, and while exerting himself with feverish activity to control\r\nand direct to his own advantage the legal negotiations for disposal of\r\npart of the Shelley estates, yet declined personal communication with\r\nShelley, and wrote to him in insulting terms, carrying sophistry so far as\r\nto assert that his dignity (save the mark!) would be compromised, not by\r\ntaking Shelley's money, but by taking it in the form of a cheque made out\r\nin his, Godwin's, own name. Small wonder if Shelley was wounded and\r\nindignant. More than any one else, Godwin had taught and encouraged him to\r\ndespise what he would have called prejudice.\r\n\r\n    \"In my judgment,\" wrote Shelley, \"neither I, nor your daughter, nor\r\n    her offspring, ought to receive the treatment which we encounter on\r\n    every side. It has perpetually appeared to me to have been your\r\n    especial duty to see that, so far as mankind value your good opinion,\r\n    we were dealt justly by, and that a young family, innocent, and\r\n    benevolent, and united should not be confounded with prostitutes and\r\n    seducers. My astonishment--and I will confess, when I have been\r\n    treated with most harshness and cruelty by you, my indignation--has\r\n    been extreme, that, knowing as you do my nature, any consideration\r\n    should have prevailed on you to be thus harsh and cruel. I lamented\r\n    also over my ruined hopes, of all that your genius once taught me to\r\n    expect from your virtue, when I found that for yourself, your family,\r\n    and your creditors, you would submit to that communication with me\r\n    which you once rejected and abhorred, and which no pity for my poverty\r\n    or sufferings, assumed willingly for you, could avail to extort. Do\r\n    not talk of _forgiveness_ again to me, for my blood boils in my veins,\r\n    and my gall rises against all that bears the human form, when I think\r\n    of what I, their benefactor and ardent lover, have endured of enmity\r\n    and contempt from you and from all mankind.\"\r\n\r\nThat other, ordinary, people should resent his avowed opposition to\r\nconventional morality was, even to Shelley, less of an enigma than that\r\nGodwin, from whom he expected support, should turn against him. Yet he\r\nnever could clearly realise the aspect which his relations with Mary bore\r\nto the world, who merely saw in him a married man who had deserted his\r\nwife and eloped with a girl of sixteen. He thought people should\r\nunderstand all he knew, and credit him with all he did not tell them; that\r\nthey should sympathise and fraternise with him, and honour Mary the more,\r\nnot the less, for what she had done and dared. Instead of this, the world\r\naccepted his family's estimate of its unfortunate eldest son, and cut him.\r\nIt is no wonder that, as Peacock puts it, \"the spirit of restlessness came\r\nover him again,\" and drove him abroad once more. His first intention was\r\nto settle with Mary and their infant child in some remote region of\r\nScotland or Northern England. But he was at all times delicate, and he\r\nlonged for balmy air and sunny skies. To these motives were added Clara's\r\nwishes, and, as she herself states, her pressing solicitations. Byron, she\r\nknew, was going to Geneva, and she persuaded the Shelleys to go there\r\nalso, in the hope and intention of meeting him. Shelley had read and\r\nadmired several of Byron's poems, and the prospect of possible\r\ncompanionship with a kindred mind was now and at all times supremely\r\nattractive to him. He had made repeated, but fruitless efforts to get a\r\npersonal interview with Godwin, in the hope, probably, of coming to some\r\ndefinite understanding as to his hopelessly involved and intricate\r\naffairs. Godwin went off to Scotland on literary business and was absent\r\nall April. Before he returned Shelley, Mary, and Clara had started for\r\nSwitzerland. The Shelleys were still ignorant and unsuspecting of the\r\nintrigue between Byron and Clara. Byron, knowing of Clara's wish to follow\r\nhim to Geneva, enjoined her on no account to come alone or without\r\nprotection, as he knew she was capable of doing; hence her determinate\r\nwish that the Shelleys should come. She wrote to Byron from Paris to tell\r\nhim that she was so far on her way, accompanied by \"the whole tribe of\r\nOtaheite philosophers,\" as she styles her friends and escort. Just before\r\nsailing from Dover Shelley wrote to Godwin, who was still in Scotland,\r\ntelling him finally of the unsuccessful issue to his Chancery suit, of his\r\ndoubtful and limited prospects of income or of ability to pay more than\r\nL300 for Godwin, and that only some months hence. He referred again to his\r\npainful position in England, and his present determination to remain\r\nabroad,--perhaps for ever,--with the exception of a possible, solitary,\r\nvisit to London, should business make this inevitable. He touched on his\r\nold obligations to Godwin, assuring him of his continued respect and\r\nadmiration in spite of the painful past, and of his regret for any too\r\nvehement words he might have used.\r\n\r\n    It is unfortunate for me that the part of your character which is\r\n    least excellent should have been met by my convictions of what was\r\n    right to do. But I have been too indignant, I have been unjust to\r\n    you--forgive me--burn those letters which contain the records of my\r\n    violence, and believe that however what you erroneously call fame and\r\n    honour separate us, I shall always feel towards you as the most\r\n    affectionate of friends.\r\n\r\nThe travellers reached Geneva by the middle of May; their arrival\r\npreceding that of Byron by several days. A letter written by Mary Shelley\r\nfrom their first resting-place, the Hotel de Secheron, the descriptive\r\nportions of which were afterwards published by her, with the _Journal of a\r\nSix Weeks Tour_, gives a graphic account of their journey and their first\r\nimpressions of Geneva.\r\n\r\n    HOTEL DE SECHERON, GENEVA,\r\n    _17th May 1816_.\r\n\r\n    We arrived at Paris on the 8th of this month, and were detained two\r\n    days for the purpose of obtaining the various signatures necessary to\r\n    our passports, the French Government having become much more\r\n    circumspect since the escape of Lavalette. We had no letters of\r\n    introduction, or any friend in that city, and were therefore confined\r\n    to our hotel, where we were obliged to hire apartments for the week,\r\n    although, when we first arrived, we expected to be detained one night\r\n    only; for in Paris there are no houses where you can be accommodated\r\n    with apartments by the day.\r\n\r\n    The manners of the French are interesting, although less attractive,\r\n    at least to Englishmen, than before the last invasion of the Allies;\r\n    the discontent and sullenness of their minds perpetually betrays\r\n    itself. Nor is it wonderful that they should regard the subjects of a\r\n    Government which fills their country with hostile garrisons, and\r\n    sustains a detested dynasty on the throne, with an acrimony and\r\n    indignation of which that Government alone is the proper object. This\r\n    feeling is honourable to the French, and encouraging to all those of\r\n    every nation in Europe who have a fellow-feeling with the oppressed,\r\n    and who cherish an unconquerable hope that the cause of liberty must\r\n    at length prevail.\r\n\r\n    Our route after Paris as far as Troyes lay through the same\r\n    uninteresting tract of country which we had traversed on foot nearly\r\n    two years before, but on quitting Troyes we left the road leading to\r\n    Neufchatel, to follow that which was to conduct us to Geneva. We\r\n    entered Dijon on the third evening after our departure from Paris, and\r\n    passing through Dole, arrived at Poligny. This town is built at the\r\n    foot of Jura, which rises abruptly from a plain of vast extent. The\r\n    rocks of the mountain overhang the houses. Some difficulty in\r\n    procuring horses detained us here until the evening closed in, when we\r\n    proceeded by the light of a stormy moon to Champagnolles, a little\r\n    village situated in the depth of the mountains. The road was\r\n    serpentine and exceedingly steep, and was overhung on one side by\r\n    half-distinguished precipices, whilst the other was a gulf, filled by\r\n    the darkness of the driving clouds. The dashing of the invisible\r\n    streams announced to us that we had quitted the plains of France, as\r\n    we slowly ascended amidst a violent storm of wind and rain, to\r\n    Champagnolles, where we arrived at twelve o'clock the fourth night\r\n    after our departure from Paris. The next morning we proceeded, still\r\n    ascending among the ravines and valleys of the mountain. The scenery\r\n    perpetually grows more wonderful and sublime; pine forests of\r\n    impenetrable thickness and untrodden, nay, inaccessible expanse spread\r\n    on every side. Sometimes the dark woods descending follow the route\r\n    into the valleys, the distorted trees struggling with knotted roots\r\n    between the most barren clefts; sometimes the road winds high into the\r\n    regions of frost, and then the forests become scattered, and the\r\n    branches of the trees are loaded with snow, and half of the enormous\r\n    pines themselves buried in the wavy drifts. The spring, as the\r\n    inhabitants informed us, was unusually late, and indeed the cold was\r\n    excessive; as we ascended the mountains the same clouds which rained\r\n    on us in the valleys poured forth large flakes of snow thick and fast.\r\n    The sun occasionally shone through these showers, and illuminated the\r\n    magnificent ravines of the mountains, whose gigantic pines were, some\r\n    laden with snow, some wreathed round by the lines of scattered and\r\n    lingering vapour; others darting their spires into the sunny sky,\r\n    brilliantly clear and azure.\r\n\r\n    As the evening advanced, and we ascended higher, the snow, which we\r\n    had beheld whitening the overhanging rocks, now encroached upon our\r\n    road, and it snowed fast as we entered the village of Les Rousses,\r\n    where we were threatened by the apparent necessity of passing the\r\n    night in a bad inn and dirty beds. For, from that place there are two\r\n    roads to Geneva; one by Nion, in the Swiss territory, where the\r\n    mountain route is shorter and comparatively easy at that time of the\r\n    year, when the road is for several leagues covered with snow of an\r\n    enormous depth; the other road lay through Gex, and was too circuitous\r\n    and dangerous to be attempted at so late an hour in the day. Our\r\n    passport, however, was for Gex, and we were told that we could not\r\n    change its destination; but all these police laws, so severe in\r\n    themselves, are to be softened by bribery, and this difficulty was at\r\n    length overcome. We hired four horses, and ten men to support the\r\n    carriage, and departed from Les Rousses at six in the evening, when\r\n    the sun had already far descended, and the snow pelting against the\r\n    windows of our carriage assisted the coming darkness to deprive us of\r\n    the view of the lake of Geneva and the far-distant Alps.\r\n\r\n    The prospect around, however, was sufficiently sublime to command our\r\n    attention--never was scene more awfully desolate. The trees in these\r\n    regions are incredibly large, and stand in scattered clumps over the\r\n    white wilderness; the vast expanse of snow was chequered only by these\r\n    gigantic pines, and the poles that marked our road; no river nor\r\n    rock-encircled lawn relieved the eye, by adding the picturesque to the\r\n    sublime. The natural silence of that uninhabited desert contrasted\r\n    strangely with the voices of the men who conducted us, who, with\r\n    animated tones and gestures, called to one another in a _patois_\r\n    composed of French and Italian, creating disturbance where, but for\r\n    them, there was none. To what a different scene are we now arrived! To\r\n    the warm sunshine, and to the humming of sun-loving insects. From the\r\n    windows of our hotel we see the lovely lake, blue as the heavens which\r\n    it reflects, and sparkling with golden beams. The opposite shore is\r\n    sloping and covered with vines, which, however, do not so early in the\r\n    season add to the beauty of the prospect. Gentlemen's seats are\r\n    scattered over these banks, behind which rise the various ridges of\r\n    black mountains, and towering far above, in the midst of its snowy\r\n    Alps, the majestic Mont Blanc, highest and queen of all. Such is the\r\n    view reflected by the lake; it is a bright summer scene without any of\r\n    that sacred solitude and deep seclusion that delighted us at Lucerne.\r\n    We have not yet found out any very agreeable walks, but you know our\r\n    attachment to water excursions. We have hired a boat, and every\r\n    evening, at about six o'clock, we sail on the lake, which is\r\n    delightful, whether we glide over a glassy surface or are speeded\r\n    along by a strong wind. The waves of this lake never afflict me with\r\n    that sickness that deprives me of all enjoyment in a sea-voyage; on\r\n    the contrary, the tossing of our boat raises my spirits and inspires\r\n    me with unusual hilarity. Twilight here is of short duration, but we\r\n    at present enjoy the benefit of an increasing moon, and seldom return\r\n    until ten o'clock, when, as we approach the shore, we are saluted by\r\n    the delightful scent of flowers and new-mown grass, and the chirp of\r\n    the grasshoppers, and the song of the evening birds.\r\n\r\n    We do not enter into society here, yet our time passes swiftly and\r\n    delightfully.\r\n\r\n    We read Latin and Italian during the heats of noon, and when the sun\r\n    declines we walk in the garden of the hotel, looking at the rabbits,\r\n    relieving fallen cockchafers, and watching the motions of a myriad of\r\n    lizards, who inhabit a southern wall of the garden. You know that we\r\n    have just escaped from the gloom of winter and of London; and coming\r\n    to this delightful spot during this divine weather, I feel as happy as\r\n    a new-fledged bird, and hardly care what twig I fly to, so that I may\r\n    try my new-found wings. A more experienced bird may be more difficult\r\n    in its choice of a bower; but, in my present temper of mind, the\r\n    budding flowers, the fresh grass of spring, and the happy creatures\r\n    about me that live and enjoy these pleasures, are quite enough to\r\n    afford me exquisite delight, even though clouds should shut out Mont\r\n    Blanc from my sight. Adieu!\r\n\r\n      M. S.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of May Byron, accompanied by his young Italian physician,\r\nPolidori, and attended by three men-servants, arrived at the Hotel de\r\nSecheron. It was now that he and Shelley became for the first time\r\npersonally acquainted; an acquaintance which, though it never did and\r\nnever could ripen quite into friendship, developed with time and\r\ncircumstances into an association more or less familiar which lasted all\r\nShelley's life. After the arrival of the English Milord and his retinue,\r\nthe hotel quarters probably became less quiet and comfortable, and before\r\nJune the Shelleys, with Clare[18] (who, while her secret remained a\r\nsecret, must have found it inexpedient to live under the same roof with\r\nByron) moved to a cottage on the other side of the lake, near Coligny;\r\nknown as Maison Chapuis, but sometimes called Campagne Mont Alegre.\r\n\r\n    CAMPAGNE CHAPUIS, NEAR COLIGNY,\r\n    _1st June_.\r\n\r\n    You will perceive from my date that we have changed our residence\r\n    since my last letter. We now inhabit a little cottage on the opposite\r\n    shore of the lake, and have exchanged the view of Mont Blanc and her\r\n    snowy _aiguilles_ for the dark frowning Jura, behind whose range we\r\n    every evening see the sun sink, and darkness approaches our valley\r\n    from behind the Alps, which are then tinged by that glowing rose-like\r\n    hue which is observed in England to attend on the clouds of an\r\n    autumnal sky when daylight is almost gone. The lake is at our feet,\r\n    and a little harbour contains our boat, in which we still enjoy our\r\n    evening excursions on the water. Unfortunately we do not now enjoy\r\n    those brilliant skies that hailed us on our first arrival to this\r\n    country. An almost perpetual rain confines us principally to the\r\n    house; but when the sun bursts forth it is with a splendour and heat\r\n    unknown in England. The thunderstorms that visit us are grander and\r\n    more terrific than I have ever seen before. We watch them as they\r\n    approach from the opposite side of the lake, observing the lightning\r\n    play among the clouds in various parts of the heavens, and dart in\r\n    jagged figures upon the piny heights of Jura, dark with the shadow of\r\n    the overhanging clouds, while perhaps the sun is shining cheerily upon\r\n    us. One night we _enjoyed_ a finer storm than I had ever before\r\n    beheld. The lake was lit up, the pines on Jura made visible, and all\r\n    the scene illuminated for an instant, when a pitchy blackness\r\n    succeeded, and the thunder came in frightful bursts over our heads\r\n    amid the darkness.\r\n\r\n    But while I still dwell on the country around Geneva, you will expect\r\n    me to say something of the town itself; there is nothing, however, in\r\n    it that can repay you for the trouble of walking over its rough\r\n    stones. The houses are high, the streets narrow, many of them on the\r\n    ascent, and no public building of any beauty to attract your eye, or\r\n    any architecture to gratify your taste. The town is surrounded by a\r\n    wall, the three gates of which are shut exactly at ten o'clock, when\r\n    no bribery (as in France) can open them. To the south of the town is\r\n    the promenade of the Genevese, a grassy plain planted with a few\r\n    trees, and called Plainpalais. Here a small obelisk is erected to the\r\n    glory of Rousseau, and here (such is the mutability of human life) the\r\n    magistrates, the successors of those who exiled him from his native\r\n    country, were shot by the populace during that revolution which his\r\n    writings mainly contributed to mature, and which, notwithstanding the\r\n    temporary bloodshed and injustice with which it was polluted, has\r\n    produced enduring benefits to mankind, which not all the chicanery of\r\n    statesmen, nor even the great conspiracy of kings, can entirely render\r\n    vain. From respect to the memory of their predecessors, none of the\r\n    present magistrates ever walk in Plainpalais. Another Sunday\r\n    recreation for the citizens is an excursion to the top of Mont Salere.\r\n    This hill is within a league of the town, and rises perpendicularly\r\n    from the cultivated plain. It is ascended on the other side, and I\r\n    should judge from its situation that your toil is rewarded by a\r\n    delightful view of the course of the Rhone and Arne, and of the shores\r\n    of the lake. We have not yet visited it. There is more equality of\r\n    classes here than in England. This occasions a greater freedom and\r\n    refinement of manners among the lower orders than we meet with in our\r\n    own country. I fancy the haughty English ladies are greatly disgusted\r\n    with this consequence of republican institutions, for the Genevese\r\n    servants complain very much of their _scolding_, an exercise of the\r\n    tongue, I believe, perfectly unknown here. The peasants of Switzerland\r\n    may not however emulate the vivacity and grace of the French. They are\r\n    more cleanly, but they are slow and inapt. I know a girl of twenty\r\n    who, although she had lived all her life among vineyards, could not\r\n    inform me during what month the vintage took place, and I discovered\r\n    she was utterly ignorant of the order in which the months succeed one\r\n    another. She would not have been surprised if I had talked of the\r\n    burning sun and delicious fruits of December, or of the frosts of\r\n    July. Yet she is by no means deficient in understanding.\r\n\r\n    The Genevese are also much inclined to puritanism. It is true that\r\n    from habit they dance on a Sunday, but as soon as the French\r\n    Government was abolished in the town, the magistrates ordered the\r\n    theatre to be closed, and measures were taken to pull down the\r\n    building.\r\n\r\n    We have latterly enjoyed fine weather, and nothing is more pleasant\r\n    than to listen to the evening song of the wine-dressers. They are all\r\n    women, and most of them have harmonious although masculine voices. The\r\n    theme of their ballads consists of shepherds, love, flocks, and the\r\n    sons of kings who fall in love with beautiful shepherdesses. Their\r\n    tunes are monotonous, but it is sweet to hear them in the stillness of\r\n    evening, while we are enjoying the sight of the setting sun, either\r\n    from the hill behind our house or from the lake.\r\n\r\n    Such are our pleasures here, which would be greatly increased if the\r\n    season had been more favourable, for they chiefly consist in such\r\n    enjoyments as sunshine and gentle breezes bestow. We have not yet made\r\n    any excursion in the environs of the town, but we have planned\r\n    several, when you shall again hear of us; and we will endeavour, by\r\n    the magic of words, to transport the ethereal part of you to the\r\n    neighbourhood of the Alps, and mountain streams, and forests, which,\r\n    while they clothe the former, darken the latter with their vast\r\n    shadows.--Adieu!\r\n\r\n      M.\r\n\r\nLess than a fortnight after this Byron also left the hotel, annoyed beyond\r\nendurance by the unbounded curiosity of which he was the object. He\r\nestablished himself at the Villa Diodati, on the hill above the Shelleys'\r\ncottage, from which it was separated by a vineyard. Both he and Shelley\r\nwere devoted to boating, and passed much time on the water, on one\r\noccasion narrowly escaping being drowned. Visits from one house to the\r\nother were of daily occurrence. The evenings were generally spent at\r\nDiodati, when the whole party would sit up into the small hours of the\r\nmorning, discussing all possible and impossible things in earth and\r\nheaven. In temperament Shelley and Byron were indeed radically opposed to\r\neach other, but the intellectual intercourse of two men, alike condemned\r\nto much isolation from their kind by their gifts, their dispositions, and\r\ntheir misfortunes, could not but be a source of enjoyment to each. Despite\r\nhis deep grain of sarcastic egotism, Byron did justice to Shelley's\r\nsincerity, simplicity, and purity of nature, and appreciated at their just\r\nvalue his mental powers and literary accomplishments. On the other hand,\r\nShelley's admiration of Byron's genius was simply unbounded, while he\r\napprehended the mixture of gold and clay in Byron's disposition with\r\nsingular acuteness. His was the \"pure mind that penetrateth heaven and\r\nhell.\" But at Geneva the two men were only finding each other out, and, to\r\nShelley at least, any pain arising from difference of feeling or opinion\r\nwas outweighed by the intense pleasure and refreshment of intellectual\r\ncomradeship.\r\n\r\nNaturally fond of society, and indeed requiring its stimulus to elicit her\r\nbest powers, Mary yet took a passive rather than an active share in these\r\n_symposia_. Looking back on them many years afterwards she wrote: \"Since\r\nincapacity and timidity always prevented my mingling in the nightly\r\nconversations of Diodati, they were, as it were, entirely _tete-a-tete_\r\nbetween my Shelley and Albe.\"[19] But she was a keen, eager listener.\r\nNothing escaped her observation, and none of this time was ever\r\nobliterated from her memory.\r\n\r\nTo the intellectual ferment, so to speak, of the Diodati evenings, working\r\nwith the new experiences and thoughts of the past two years, is due the\r\nconception of the story by which, as a writer, she is best remembered, the\r\nghastly but powerful allegorical romance of _Frankenstein_. In her\r\nintroduction to a late edition of this work (part of which has already\r\nbeen quoted here) Mary Shelley has herself told the history of its origin.\r\n\r\n    In the summer of 1816 we visited Switzerland, and became the\r\n    neighbours of Lord Byron. At first we spent our pleasant hours on the\r\n    lake, or wandering on its shores, and Lord Byron, who was writing the\r\n    third canto of _Childe Harold_, was the only one among us who put his\r\n    thoughts upon paper. These, as he brought them successively to us,\r\n    clothed in all the light and harmony of poetry, seemed to stamp as\r\n    divine the glories of heaven and earth, whose influences we partook\r\n    with him.\r\n\r\n    But it proved a wet, ungenial summer, and incessant rain often\r\n    confined us for days to the house. Some volumes of ghost stories,\r\n    translated from the German into French, fell into our hands. There was\r\n    the history of the Inconstant Lover, who, when he thought to clasp the\r\n    bride to whom he had pledged his vows, found himself in the arms of\r\n    the pale ghost of her whom he had deserted. There was the tale of the\r\n    sinful founder of his race, whose miserable doom it was to bestow the\r\n    kiss of death on all the younger sons of his fated house, just when\r\n    they reached the age of promise. His gigantic shadowy form, clothed,\r\n    like the ghost in Hamlet, in complete armour, but with the beaver up,\r\n    was seen at midnight, by the moon's fitful beams, to advance slowly\r\n    along the gloomy avenue. The shape was lost beneath the shadow of the\r\n    castle walls; but soon a gate swung back, a step was heard, the door\r\n    of the chamber opened, and he advanced to the couch of the blooming\r\n    youths, cradled in healthy sleep. Eternal sorrow sat upon his face as\r\n    he bent down and kissed the forehead of the boys, who from that hour\r\n    withered like flowers snapt upon the stalk. I have not seen these\r\n    stories since then, but their incidents are as fresh in my mind as if\r\n    I had read them yesterday. \"We will each write a ghost story,\" said\r\n    Byron; and his proposition was acceded to. There were four of us. The\r\n    noble author began a tale, a fragment of which he printed at the end\r\n    of his poem of Mazeppa. Shelley, more apt to embody ideas and\r\n    sentiments in the radiance of brilliant imagery, and in the music of\r\n    the most melodious verse that adorns our language, than to invent the\r\n    machinery of a story, commenced one founded on the experiences of his\r\n    early life. Poor Polidori had some terrible idea about a skull-headed\r\n    lady, who was so punished for peeping through a keyhole--what to see I\r\n    forget--something very shocking and wrong of course; but when she was\r\n    reduced to a worse condition than the renowned Tom of Coventry he did\r\n    not know what to do with her, and he was obliged to despatch her to\r\n    the tomb of the Capulets, the only place for which she was fitted. The\r\n    illustrious poets also, annoyed by the platitude of prose, speedily\r\n    relinquished their ungrateful task. I busied myself to _think of a\r\n    story_,--a story to rival those which had excited us to this task. One\r\n    that would speak to the mysterious fears of our nature, and awaken\r\n    thrilling horror--one to make the reader dread to look round, to\r\n    curdle the blood and quicken the beatings of the heart. If I did not\r\n    accomplish these things my ghost story would be unworthy of its name.\r\n    I thought and wondered--vainly. I felt that blank incapability of\r\n    invention which is the greatest misery of authorship, when dull\r\n    Nothing replies to our anxious invocations. \"_Have you thought of a\r\n    story?_\" I was asked each morning, and each morning I was forced to\r\n    reply with a mortifying negative.\r\n\r\n    Everything must have a beginning, to speak in Sanchean phrase: and\r\n    that beginning must be linked to something that went before. The\r\n    Hindoos give the world an elephant to support it, but they make the\r\n    elephant stand upon a tortoise. Invention, it must be humbly admitted,\r\n    does not consist in creating out of void, but out of chaos; the\r\n    materials must, in the first place, be afforded: it can give form to\r\n    dark shapeless substances, but cannot bring into being the substance\r\n    itself. In all matters of discovery and invention, even of those that\r\n    appertain to the imagination, we are continually reminded of the story\r\n    of Columbus and his egg. Invention consists in the capacity of seizing\r\n    on the capabilities of a subject, and in the power of moulding and\r\n    fashioning ideas suggested to it.\r\n\r\n    Many and long were the conversations between Lord Byron and Shelley,\r\n    to which I was a devout but nearly silent listener. During one of\r\n    these various philosophical doctrines were discussed, and, among\r\n    others, the nature of the principle of life, and whether there was any\r\n    probability of its ever being discovered and communicated. They talked\r\n    of the experiments of Dr. Darwin (I speak not of what the doctor\r\n    really did, or said that he did, but, as more to my purpose, of what\r\n    was then spoken of as having been done by him), who preserved a piece\r\n    of vermicelli in a glass case till by some extraordinary means it\r\n    began to move with voluntary motion. Not thus, after all, would life\r\n    be given. Perhaps a corpse would be reanimated; galvanism had given\r\n    token of such things; perhaps the component parts of a creature might\r\n    be manufactured, brought together, and endued with vital warmth.\r\n\r\n    Night waned upon this talk, and even the witching hour had gone by,\r\n    before we retired to rest. When I placed my head upon my pillow I did\r\n    not sleep, nor could I be said to think. My imagination, unbidden,\r\n    possessed and guided me, gifting the successive images that arose in\r\n    my mind with a vividness far beyond the usual bounds of reverie. I\r\n    saw--with shut eyes, but acute mental vision,--I saw the pale student\r\n    of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together--I\r\n    saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the\r\n    working of some powerful engine, show signs of life, and stir with an\r\n    uneasy, half vital motion. Frightful must it be; for supremely\r\n    frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the\r\n    stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world. His success would\r\n    terrify the artist; he would rush away from his odious handiwork,\r\n    horrorstricken. He would hope that, left to itself, the slight spark\r\n    which he had communicated would fade; that this thing, which had\r\n    received such imperfect animation, would subside into dead matter; and\r\n    he might sleep in the belief that the silence of the grave would\r\n    quench for ever the transient existence of the hideous corpse which he\r\n    had looked upon as the cradle of life. He sleeps; but he is awakened;\r\n    he opens his eyes; behold the horrid thing stands at his bedside,\r\n    opening his curtains, and looking on him with yellow, watery, but\r\n    speculative eyes.\r\n\r\n    I opened mine in terror. The idea so possessed my mind that a thrill\r\n    of fear ran through me, and I wished to exchange the ghastly image of\r\n    my fancy for the realities around. I see them still; the very room,\r\n    the dark _parquet_, the closed shutters, with the moonlight struggling\r\n    through, and the sense I had that the glassy lake and white high Alps\r\n    were beyond. I could not so easily get rid of my hideous phantom;\r\n    still it haunted me. I must try to think of something else. I recurred\r\n    to my ghost story--my tiresome unlucky ghost story. O! if I could only\r\n    contrive one which would frighten my reader as I myself had been\r\n    frightened that night!\r\n\r\n    Swift as light and as cheering was the idea that broke in upon me. \"I\r\n    have found it! What terrified me will terrify others; and I need only\r\n    describe the spectre which had haunted my midnight pillow.\" On the\r\n    morrow I announced that I had _thought of a story_. I began that day\r\n    with the words, _It was on a dreary night of November_, making only a\r\n    transcript of the grim terrors of my waking dream.\r\n\r\n    At first I thought of but a few pages--of a short tale; but Shelley\r\n    urged me to develop the idea at greater length. I certainly did not\r\n    owe the suggestion of one incident, nor scarcely of one train of\r\n    feeling, to my husband, and yet, but for his incitement, it would\r\n    never have taken the form in which it was presented to the world. From\r\n    this declaration I must except the preface. As far as I can recollect,\r\n    it was entirely written by him.\r\n\r\nEvery one now knows the story of the \"Modern Prometheus,\"--the student\r\nwho, having devoted himself to the search for the principle of life,\r\ndiscovers it, manufactures an imitation of a human being, endows it with\r\nvitality, and having thus encroached on divine prerogative, finds himself\r\nthe slave of his own creature, for he has set in motion a force beyond his\r\npower to control or annihilate. Aghast at the actual and possible\r\nconsequences of his own achievement, he recoils from carrying it out to\r\nits ultimate end, and stops short of doing what is necessary to render\r\nthis force independent. The being has, indeed, the perception and desire\r\nof goodness; but is, by the circumstances of its abnormal existence,\r\ndelivered over to evil, and Frankenstein, and all whom he loves, fall\r\nvictims to its vindictive malice. Surely no girl, before or since, has\r\nimagined, and carried out to its pitiless conclusion so grim an idea.\r\n\r\nMary began her rough sketch of this story during the absence of Shelley\r\nand Byron on a voyage round the lake of Geneva; the memorable excursion\r\nduring which Byron wrote the _Prisoner of Chillon_ and great part of the\r\nthird canto of _Childe Harold_, and Shelley conceived the idea of that\r\n\"Hymn to Intellectual Beauty,\" which may be called his confession of\r\nfaith. When they returned they found Mary hard at work on the fantastic\r\nspeculation which possessed her mind and exerted over it a fascination and\r\na power of excitement beyond that of the sublime external nature which\r\ninspired the two poets.\r\n\r\nWhen, in July, she set off with Shelley and Clare on a short tour to the\r\nValley of Chamounix, she took her MS. with her. They visited the Mer de\r\nGlace, and the source of the Arveiron. The magnificent scenery which\r\ninspired Shelley with his poem on \"Mont Blanc,\" and is described by Mary\r\nin the extracts from her journal which follow, served her as a fitting\r\nbackground for the most preternatural portions of her romance.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, July 23_ (Chamounix).--In the morning, after breakfast, we\r\n    mount our mules to see the source of the Arveiron. When we had gone\r\n    about three parts of the way, we descended and continued our route on\r\n    foot, over loose stones, many of which were an enormous size. We came\r\n    to the source, which lies (like a stage) surrounded on the three sides\r\n    by mountains and glaciers. We sat on a rock, which formed the fourth,\r\n    gazing on the scene before us. An immense glacier was on our left,\r\n    which continually rolled stones to its foot. It is very dangerous to\r\n    be directly under this. Our guide told us a story of two Hollanders\r\n    who went, without any guide, into a cavern of the glacier, and fired a\r\n    pistol there, which drew down a large piece on them. We see several\r\n    avalanches, some very small, others of great magnitude, which roared\r\n    and smoked, overwhelming everything as it passed along, and\r\n    precipitating great pieces of ice into the valley below. This glacier\r\n    is increasing every day a foot, closing up the valley. We drink some\r\n    water of the Arveiron and return. After dinner think it will rain, and\r\n    Shelley goes alone to the glacier of Boison. I stay at home. Read\r\n    several tales of Voltaire. In the evening I copy Shelley's letter to\r\n    Peacock.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, July 24._--To-day is rainy; therefore we cannot go to Col\r\n    de Balme. About 10 the weather appears clearing up. Shelley and I\r\n    begin our journey to Montanvert. Nothing can be more desolate than the\r\n    ascent of this mountain; the trees in many places having been torn\r\n    away by avalanches, and some half leaning over others, intermingled\r\n    with stones, present the appearance of vast and dreadful desolation.\r\n    It began to rain almost as soon as we left our inn. When we had\r\n    mounted considerably we turned to look on the scene. A dense white\r\n    mist covered the vale, and tops of scattered pines peeping above were\r\n    the only objects that presented themselves. The rain continued in\r\n    torrents. We were wetted to the skin; so that, when we had ascended\r\n    halfway, we resolved to turn back. As we descended, Shelley went\r\n    before, and, tripping up, fell upon his knee. This added to the\r\n    weakness occasioned by a blow on his ascent; he fainted, and was for\r\n    some minutes incapacitated from continuing his route.\r\n\r\n    We arrived wet to the skin. I read _Nouvelles Nouvelles_, and write my\r\n    story. Shelley writes part of letter.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, July 27._--It is a most beautiful day, without a cloud. We\r\n    set off at 12. The day is hot, yet there is a fine breeze. We pass by\r\n    the Great Waterfall, which presents an aspect of singular beauty. The\r\n    wind carries it away from the rock, and on towards the north, and the\r\n    fine spray into which it is entirely dissolved passes before the\r\n    mountain like a mist.\r\n\r\n    The other cascade has very little water, and is consequently not so\r\n    beautiful as before. The evening of the day is calm and beautiful.\r\n    Evening is the only time I enjoy travelling. The horses went fast, and\r\n    the plain opened before us. We saw Jura and the Lake like old friends.\r\n    I longed to see my pretty babe. At 9, after much inquiring and\r\n    stupidity, we find the road, and alight at Diodati. We converse with\r\n    Lord Byron till 12, and then go down to Chapuis, kiss our babe, and go\r\n    to bed.\r\n\r\nCircumstances had modified Shelley's previous intention of remaining\r\npermanently abroad, and the end of August found him moving homeward.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from Mary's diary give a sketch of their life\r\nduring the few weeks preceding their return to England.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, July 28_ (Montalegre).--I read Voltaire's _Romans_. Shelley\r\n    reads Lucretius, and talks with Clare. After dinner he goes out in the\r\n    boat with Lord Byron, and we all go up to Diodati in the evening. This\r\n    is the second anniversary since Shelley's and my union.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, July 29._--Write; read Voltaire and Quintus Curtius. A rainy\r\n    day, with thunder and lightning. Shelley finishes Lucretius, and reads\r\n    Pliny's _Letters_.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, July 30._--Read Quintus Curtius. Shelley read Pliny's\r\n    _Letters_. After dinner we go up to Diodati, and stay the evening.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, August 1._--Make a balloon for Shelley, after which he goes\r\n    up to Diodati, to dine and spend the evening. Read twelve pages of\r\n    Curtius. Write, and read the _Reveries of Rousseau_. Shelley reads\r\n    Pliny's _Letters_.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, August 2._--I go to the town with Shelley, to buy a telescope\r\n    for his birthday present. In the evening Lord Byron and he go out in\r\n    the boat, and, after their return, Shelley and Clare go up to\r\n    Diodati; I do not, for Lord Byron did not seem to wish it. Shelley\r\n    returns with a letter from Longdill, which requires his return to\r\n    England. This puts us in bad spirits. I read _Reveries_ and _Adele et\r\n    Theodore de Madame de Genlis_, and Shelley reads Pliny's _Letters_.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, August 3._--Finish the first volume of _Adele_, and write.\r\n    After dinner write to Fanny, and go up to Diodati, where I read the\r\n    _Life of Madame du Deffand_. We come down early and talk of our plans.\r\n    Shelley reads Pliny's _Letters_, and writes letters.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, August 4._--Shelley's birthday. Write; read _Tableau de\r\n    famille_. Go out with Shelley in the boat, and read to him the fourth\r\n    book of Virgil. After dinner we go up to Diodati, but return soon. I\r\n    read Curtius with Shelley, and finish the first volume, after which we\r\n    go out in the boat to set up the balloon, but there is too much wind;\r\n    we set it up from the land, but it takes fire as soon as it is up. I\r\n    finish the _Reveries of Rousseau_. Shelley reads and finishes Pliny's\r\n    _Letters_, and begins the _Panegyric of Trajan_.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, August 7._--Write, and read ten pages of Curtius. Lord\r\n    Byron and Shelley go out in the boat. I translate in the evening, and\r\n    afterwards go up to Diodati. Shelley reads Tacitus.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, August 9._--Write and translate; finish _Adele_, and read a\r\n    little Curtius. Shelley goes out in the boat with Lord Byron in the\r\n    morning and in the evening, and reads Tacitus. About 3 o'clock we go\r\n    up to Diodati. We receive a long letter from Fanny.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FANNY TO MARY.\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _29th July 1816_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MARY--I have just received yours, which gave me great\r\n    pleasure, though not quite so satisfactory a one as I could have\r\n    wished. I plead guilty to the charge of having written in some degree\r\n    in an ill humour; but if you knew how I am harassed by a variety of\r\n    trying circumstances, I am sure you would feel for me. Besides other\r\n    plagues, I was oppressed with the most violent cold in my head when I\r\n    last wrote you that I ever had in my life. I will now, however,\r\n    endeavour to give as much information from England as I am capable of\r\n    giving, mixed up with as little spleen as possible. I have received\r\n    Jane's letter, which was a very dear and a very sweet one, and I\r\n    should have answered it but for the dreadful state of mind I generally\r\n    labour under, and which I in vain endeavour to get rid of. From your\r\n    and Jane's description of the weather in Switzerland, it has produced\r\n    more mischief abroad than here. Our rain has been as constant as\r\n    yours, for it rains every day, but it has not been accompanied by\r\n    violent storms. All accounts from the country say that the corn has\r\n    not yet suffered, but that it is yet perfectly green; but I fear that\r\n    the sun will not come this year to ripen it. As yet we have had fires\r\n    almost constantly, and have just got a few strawberries. You ask for\r\n    particulars of the state of England. I do not understand the causes\r\n    for the distress which I see, and hear dreadful accounts of, every\r\n    day; but I know that they really exist. Papa, I believe, does not\r\n    think much, or does not inquire, on these subjects, for I never can\r\n    get him to give me any information. From Mr. Booth I got the clearest\r\n    account, which has been confirmed by others since. He says that it is\r\n    the \"Peace\" that has brought all this calamity upon us; that during\r\n    the war the whole Continent were employed in fighting and defending\r\n    their country from the incursions of foreign armies; that England\r\n    alone was free to manufacture in peace; that our manufactories, in\r\n    consequence, employed several millions, and at higher wages, than were\r\n    wanted for our own consumption. Now peace is come, foreign ports are\r\n    shut, and millions of our fellow-creatures left to starve. He also\r\n    says that we have no need to manufacture for ourselves--that we have\r\n    enough of the various articles of our manufacture to last for seven\r\n    years--and that the going on is only increasing the evil. They say\r\n    that in the counties of Staffordshire and Shropshire there are 26,000\r\n    men out of employment, and without the means of getting any. A few\r\n    weeks since there were several parties of colliers, who came as far as\r\n    St. Albans and Oxford, dragging coals in immense waggons, without\r\n    horses, to the Prince Regent at Carlton House; one of these waggons\r\n    was said to be conducted by a hundred colliers. The Ministers,\r\n    however, thought proper, when these men had got to the distance from\r\n    London of St. Albans, to send Magistrates to them, who paid them\r\n    handsomely for their coals, and gave them money besides, telling them\r\n    that coming to London would only create disturbance and riot, without\r\n    relieving their misery; they therefore turned back, and the coals were\r\n    given away to the poor people of the neighbourhood where they were\r\n    met. This may give you some idea of the misery suffered. At Glasgow,\r\n    the state of wretchedness is worse than anywhere else. Houses that\r\n    formerly employed two or three hundred men now only employ three or\r\n    four individuals. There have been riots of a very serious nature in\r\n    the inland counties, arising from the same causes. This, joined to\r\n    this melancholy season, has given us all very serious alarm, and\r\n    helped to make me write so dismally. They talk of a change of\r\n    Ministers; but this can effect no good; it is a change of the whole\r\n    system of things that is wanted. Mr. Owen, however, tells us to cheer\r\n    up, for that in two years we shall feel the good effect of his plans;\r\n    he is quite certain that they will succeed. I have no doubt that he\r\n    will do a great deal of good; but how he can expect to make the rich\r\n    give up their possessions, and live in a state of equality, is too\r\n    romantic to be believed. I wish I could send you his Address to the\r\n    People of New Lanark, on the 1st of January 1816, on the opening of\r\n    the Institution for the Formation of Character. He dedicates it \"To\r\n    those who have no private ends to accomplish, who are honestly in\r\n    search of truth for the purpose of ameliorating the condition of\r\n    society, and who have the firmness to follow the truth, wherever it\r\n    may lead, without being turned aside from the pursuit by the\r\n    _prepossessions or prejudices of any part of mankind_.\"\r\n\r\n    This dedication will give you some idea of what sort of an Address it\r\n    is. This Address was delivered on a Sunday evening, in a place set\r\n    apart for the purposes of religion, and brought hundreds of persons\r\n    from the regular clergymen to hear his profane Address,--against all\r\n    religions, governments, and all sorts of aristocracy,--which, he says,\r\n    was received with the greatest attention and highly approved. The\r\n    outline of his plan is this: \"That no human being shall work more than\r\n    two or three hours every day; that they shall be all equal; that no\r\n    one shall dress but after the plainest and simplest manner; that they\r\n    be allowed to follow any religion, as they please; and that their\r\n    [studies] shall be Mechanics and Chemistry.\" I hate and am sick at\r\n    heart at the misery I see my fellow-beings suffering, but I own I\r\n    should not like to live to see the extinction of all genius, talent,\r\n    and elevated generous feeling in Great Britain, which I conceive to be\r\n    the natural consequence of Mr. Owen's plan. I am not either wise\r\n    enough, philosophical enough, nor historian enough, to say what will\r\n    make man plain and simple in manners and mode of life, and at the same\r\n    time a poet, a painter, and a philosopher; but this I know, that I had\r\n    rather live with the Genevese, as you and Jane describe, than live in\r\n    London, with the most brilliant beings that exist, in its present\r\n    state of vice and misery. So much for Mr. Owen, who is, indeed, a very\r\n    great and good man. He told me the other day that he wished our Mother\r\n    were living, as he had never before met with a person who thought so\r\n    exactly as he did, or who would have so warmly and zealously entered\r\n    into his plans. Indeed, there is nothing very promising in a return to\r\n    England at least for some time to come, for it is better to witness\r\n    misery in a foreign country than one's own, unless you have the means\r\n    of relieving it. I wish I could send you the books you ask for. I\r\n    should have sent them, if Longdill had not said he was not\r\n    sending--that he expected Shelley in England. I shall send again\r\n    immediately, and will then send you _Christabel_ and the \"Poet's\"\r\n    _Poems_. Were I not a dependent being in every sense of the word, but\r\n    most particularly in money, I would send you other things, which\r\n    perhaps you would be glad of. I am much more interested in Lord Byron\r\n    since I have read all his poems. When you left England I had only read\r\n    _Childe Harold_ and his smaller poems. The pleasure he has excited in\r\n    me, and gratitude I owe him for having cheered several gloomy hours,\r\n    makes me wish for a more finished portrait, both of his _mind_ and\r\n    _countenance_. From _Childe Harold_ I gained a very ill impression of\r\n    him, because I conceived it was _himself_,--notwithstanding the pains\r\n    he took to tell us it was an imaginary being. The _Giaour_, _Lara_,\r\n    and the _Corsair_ make me justly style him a poet. Do in your next\r\n    oblige me by telling me the minutest particulars of him, for it is\r\n    from the _small things_ that you learn most of character. Is his face\r\n    as fine as in your portrait of him, or is it more like the other\r\n    portrait of him? Tell me also if he has a pleasing voice, for that has\r\n    a great charm with me. Does he come into your house in a careless,\r\n    friendly, dropping-in manner? I wish to know, though not from idle\r\n    curiosity, whether he was capable of acting in the manner that the\r\n    London scandal-mongers say he did? You must by this time know if he is\r\n    a profligate in principle--a man who, like Curran, gives himself\r\n    unbounded liberty in all sorts of profligacy. I cannot think, from his\r\n    writings, that he can be such a _detestable being_. Do answer me these\r\n    questions, for where I love the poet I should like to respect the man.\r\n    Shelley's boat excursion with him must have been very delightful. I\r\n    think Lord Byron never writes so well as when he writes descriptions\r\n    of water scenes; for instance, the beginning of the _Giaour_. There is\r\n    a fine expressive line in _Childe Harold_: \"Blow, swiftly blow, thou\r\n    keen compelling gale,\" etc. There could have been no difference of\r\n    sentiment in this divine excursion; they were both poets, equally\r\n    alive to the charms of nature and the eloquent writing of Rousseau. I\r\n    long very much to read the poem the \"Poet\" has written on the spot\r\n    where Julie was drowned. When will they come to England? Say that you\r\n    have a friend who has few pleasures, and is very impatient to read the\r\n    poems written at Geneva. If they are not to be published, may I see\r\n    them in manuscript? I am angry with Shelley for not writing himself.\r\n    It is impossible to tell the good that POETS do their\r\n    fellow-creatures, at least those that can feel. Whilst I read I am a\r\n    poet. I am inspired with good feelings--feelings that create perhaps\r\n    a more permanent good in me than all the everyday preachments in the\r\n    world; it counteracts the dross which one gives on the everyday\r\n    concerns of life, and tells us there is something yet in the world to\r\n    aspire to--something by which succeeding ages may be made happy and\r\n    perhaps better. If Shelley cannot accomplish any other good, he can\r\n    this divine one. Laugh at me, but do not be angry with me, for taking\r\n    up your time with my nonsense. I have sent again to Longdill, and he\r\n    has returned the same answer as before. I can [not], therefore, send\r\n    you _Christabel_. Lamb says it ought never to have been published;\r\n    that no one understands it; and _Kubla Khan_ (which is the poem he\r\n    made in his sleep) is nonsense. Coleridge is living at Highgate; he is\r\n    living with an apothecary, to whom he pays L5 a week for board,\r\n    lodging, and medical advice. The apothecary is to take care that he\r\n    does not take either opium or spirituous liquors. Coleridge, however,\r\n    was tempted, and wrote to a chemist he knew in London to send a bottle\r\n    of laudanum to Mr. Murray's in Albemarle Street, to be enclosed in a\r\n    parcel of books to him; his landlord, however, felt the parcel\r\n    outside, and discovered the fatal bottle. Mr. Morgan told me the other\r\n    day that Coleridge improved in health under the care of the\r\n    apothecary, and was writing fast a continuation of _Christabel_.\r\n\r\n    You ask me if Mr. Booth mentioned Isabel's having received a letter\r\n    from you. He never mentioned your name to me, nor I to him; but he\r\n    told Mamma that you had written a letter to her from Calais. He is\r\n    gone back, and promises to bring Isabel next year. He has given us a\r\n    volume of his _poetry_--_true, genuine poetry_--not such as\r\n    Coleridge's or Wordsworth's, but Miss Seward's and Dr. Darwin's--\r\n\r\n      Dying swains to sighing Delias.\r\n\r\n    You ask about old friends; we have none, and see none. Poor Marshal is\r\n    in a bad way; we see very little of him. Mrs. Kenny is going\r\n    immediately to live near Orleans, which is better for her than living\r\n    in London, afraid of her creditors. The Lambs have been spending a\r\n    month in the neighbourhood of Clifton and Bristol; they were highly\r\n    delighted with Clifton. Sheridan is dead. Papa was very much grieved\r\n    at his death. William and he went to his funeral. He was buried in the\r\n    Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey, attended by all the high people.\r\n    Papa has visited his grave many times since. I am too young to\r\n    remember his speeches in Parliament. I never admired his style of\r\n    play-writing. I cannot, therefore, sympathise in the elegant tributes\r\n    to his memory which have been paid by all parties. Those things which\r\n    I have heard from all parties of his drunkenness I cannot admire. We\r\n    have had one great pleasure since your departure, in viewing a fine\r\n    collection of the Italian masters at the British Institution. Two of\r\n    the Cartoons are there. Paul preaching at Athens is the finest picture\r\n    I ever beheld.... I am going again to see this Exhibition next week,\r\n    before it closes, when I shall be better able to tell you which I most\r\n    admire of Raphael, Titian, Leonardo da Vinci, Domenichino, Claude, S.\r\n    Rosa, Poussin, Murillo, etc., and all of which cannot be too much\r\n    examined. I only wish I could have gone many times. Charles's letter\r\n    has not yet arrived. Do give me every account of him when you next\r\n    hear from him. I think it is of great consequence the mode of life he\r\n    now pursues, as it will most likely decide his future good or ill\r\n    doing. You ask what I mean by \"plans with Mr. Blood?\" I meant a\r\n    residence in Ireland. However, I will not plague you with them till I\r\n    understand them myself. My Aunt Everina will be in London next week,\r\n    when my future fate will be decided. I shall then give you a full and\r\n    clear account of what my unhappy life is to be spent in, etc. I left\r\n    it to the end of my letter to call your attention most seriously to\r\n    what I said in my last letter respecting Papa's affairs. They have now\r\n    a much more serious and threatening aspect than when I last wrote to\r\n    you. You perhaps think that Papa has gained a large sum by his novel\r\n    engagement, which is not the case. He could make no other engagement\r\n    with Constable than that they should share the profits equally between\r\n    them, which, if the novel is successful, is an advantageous bargain.\r\n    Papa, however, prevailed upon him to advance L200, to be deducted\r\n    hereafter out of the part he is to receive; and if two volumes of the\r\n    novel are not forthcoming on the 1st of January 1817, Constable has a\r\n    promissory note to come upon papa for the L200. This L200 I told you\r\n    was appropriated to Davidson and Hamilton, who had lent him L200 on\r\n    his _Caleb Williams_ last year; so that you perceive he has as yet\r\n    gained nothing on his novel, and all depends upon his future\r\n    exertions. He has been very unwell and very uneasy in his mind for the\r\n    last week, unable to write; and it was not till this day I discovered\r\n    the cause, which has given me great uneasiness. You seem to have\r\n    forgotten Kingdon's L300 to be paid at the end of June. He has had a\r\n    great deal of plague and uneasiness about it, and has at last been\r\n    obliged to give Kingdon his promissory note for L300, payable on\r\n    demand, so that every hour is not safe. Kingdon is no friend, and the\r\n    money Government money, and it cannot be expected he will show Papa\r\n    any mercy. I dread the effect on his health. He cannot sleep at night,\r\n    and is indeed very unwell. This he concealed from Mamma and myself\r\n    until this day. Taylor of Norwich has also come upon him again; he\r\n    says, owing to the distress of the country, he must have the money for\r\n    his children; but I do not fear him like Kingdon. Shelley said in his\r\n    letter, some weeks ago, that the L300 should come the end of June.\r\n    Papa, therefore, acted upon that promise. From your last letter I\r\n    perceive you think I colour my statements. I assure you I am most\r\n    anxious, when I mention these unfortunate affairs, to speak the truth,\r\n    and nothing but the truth, as it is. I think it my duty to tell you\r\n    the real state of the case, for I know you deceive yourself about\r\n    things. If Papa could go on with his novel in good spirits, I think it\r\n    would perhaps be his very best. He said the other day that he was\r\n    writing upon a subject no one had ever written upon before, and that\r\n    it would require great exertion to make it what he wished. Give my\r\n    love to Jane; thank her for her letter. I will write to her next week,\r\n    though I consider this long tiresome one as addressed to you all.\r\n    Give my love also to Shelley; tell him, if he goes any more\r\n    excursions, nothing will give me more pleasure than a description of\r\n    them. Tell him I like your [____][20] tour best, though I should like\r\n    to visit _Venice_ and _Naples_. Kiss dear William for me; I sometimes\r\n    consider him as my child, and look forward to the time of my old age\r\n    and his manhood. Do you dip him in the lake? I am much afraid you will\r\n    find this letter much too long; if it affords you any pleasure, oblige\r\n    me by a long one in return, but write small, for Mamma complains of\r\n    the postage of a double letter. I pay the full postage of all the\r\n    letters I send, and you know I have not a _sous_ of my own. Mamma is\r\n    much better, though not without rheumatism. William is better than he\r\n    ever was in his life. I am not well; my mind always keeps my body in a\r\n    fever; but never mind me. Do entreat J. to attend to her eyes. Adieu,\r\n    my dear Sister. Let me entreat you to consider seriously all that I\r\n    have said concerning your Father.--Yours, very affectionately,\r\n\r\n      FANNY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Journal, Saturday, August 10._--Write to Fanny. Shelley writes to\r\n    Charles. We then go to town to buy books and a watch for Fanny. Read\r\n    Curtius after my return; translate. In the evening Shelley and Lord\r\n    Byron go out in the boat. Translate, and when they return go up to\r\n    Diodati. Shelley reads Tacitus. A writ of arrest comes from Polidori,\r\n    for having \"casse ses lunettes et fait tomber son chapeau\" of the\r\n    apothecary who sells bad magnesia.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Monday, August 12._--Write my story and translate. Shelley goes to\r\n    the town, and afterwards goes out in the boat with Lord Byron. After\r\n    dinner I go out a little in the boat, and then Shelley goes up to\r\n    Diodati. I translate in the evening, and read _Le Vieux de la\r\n    Montagne_, and write. Shelley, in coming down, is attacked by a dog,\r\n    which delays him; we send up for him, and Lord Byron comes down; in\r\n    the meantime Shelley returns.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, August 14._--Read _Le Vieux de la Montagne_; translate.\r\n    Shelley reads Tacitus, and goes out with Lord Byron before and after\r\n    dinner. Lewis[21] comes to Diodati. Shelley goes up there, and Clare\r\n    goes up to copy. Remain at home, and read _Le Vieux de la Montagne_.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Friday, August 16._--Write, and read a little of Curtius; translate;\r\n    read _Walther_ and some of _Rienzi_. Lord Byron goes with Lewis to\r\n    Ferney. Shelley writes, and reads Tacitus.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, August 17._--Write, and finish _Walther_. In the evening I\r\n    go out in the boat with Shelley, and he afterwards goes up to Diodati.\r\n    Began one of Madame de Genlis's novels. Shelley finishes Tacitus.\r\n    Polidori comes down. Little babe is not well.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, August 18._--Talk with Shelley, and write; read Curtius.\r\n    Shelley reads Plutarch in Greek. Lord Byron comes down, and stays here\r\n    an hour. I read a novel in the evening. Shelley goes up to Diodati,\r\n    and Monk Lewis.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, August 20._--Read Curtius; write; read _Herman d'Unna_. Lord\r\n    Byron comes down after dinner, and remains with us until dark. Shelley\r\n    spends the rest of the evening at Diodati. He reads Plutarch.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, August 21._--Shelley and I talk about my story. Finish\r\n    _Herman d'Unna_ and write. Shelley reads Milton. After dinner Lord\r\n    Byron comes down, and Clare and Shelley go up to Diodati. Read\r\n    _Rienzi_.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, August 23._--Shelley goes up to Diodati, and then in the boat\r\n    with Lord Byron, who has heard bad news of Lady Byron, and is in bad\r\n    spirits concerning it....

Several books\r\n    arrive, among others Coleridge's _Christabel_, which Shelley reads\r\n    aloud to me before going to bed.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, August 28._--Packing. Shelley goes to town. Work. Polidori\r\n    comes down, and afterwards Lord Byron. After dinner we go upon the\r\n    water; pack; and Shelley goes up to Diodati. Shelley reads _Histoire\r\n    de la Revolution par Rabault_.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, August 29._--We depart from Geneva at 9 in the morning.\r\n\r\nThey travelled to Havre _via_ Dijon, Auxerre, and Villeneuve; allowing\r\nonly a few hours for visiting the palaces of Fontainebleau and Versailles,\r\nand the Cathedral of Rouen. From Havre they sailed to Portsmouth, where,\r\nfor a short time, they separated. Shelley went to stay with Peacock, who\r\nwas living at Great Marlow, and had been looking about there for a house\r\nto suit his friends. Mary and Clare proceeded to Bath, where they were to\r\nspend the next few months.\r\n\r\n    _Journal, Tuesday, September 10._--Arrive at Bath about 2. Dine, and\r\n    spend the evening in looking for lodgings. Read Mrs. Robinson's\r\n    _Valcenga_.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, September 11._--Look for lodgings; take some, and settle\r\n    ourselves. Read the first volume of _The Antiquary_, and work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 1816-FEBRUARY 1817\r\n\r\n\r\nTrouble had, for some time past, been gathering in heavy clouds. Godwin's\r\naffairs were in worse plight than ever, and the Shelleys, go where they\r\nmight, were never suffered to forget them. Fanny constituted herself his\r\nspecial pleader, and made it evident that she found it hard to believe\r\nShelley could not, if he chose, get more money than he did for Mary's\r\nfather. Her long letters, bearing witness in every line to her great\r\nnatural intelligence and sensibility, excite the deepest pity for her, and\r\nnot a little, it must be added, for those to whom they were addressed. The\r\npoor girl's life was, indeed, a hard one, and of all her trials perhaps\r\nthe most insurmountable was that inherited melancholy of the\r\nWollstonecraft temperament which permitted her no illusions, no moments,\r\neven, of respite from care in unreasoning gaiety such as are incidental to\r\nmost young and healthy natures. Nor, although she won every one's respect\r\nand most people's liking, had she the inborn gift of inspiring devotion or\r\narousing enthusiasm. She was one of those who give all and take nothing.\r\nThe people she loved all cared for others more than they did for her, or\r\ncared only for themselves. Full of warmth and affection and ideal\r\naspirations; sympathetically responsive to every poem, every work of art\r\nappealing to imagination, she was condemned by her temperament and the\r\nsurroundings of her life to idealise nothing, and to look at all objects\r\nas they presented themselves to her, in the light of the very commonest\r\nday.\r\n\r\nLess pressing than Godwin, but still another disturbing cause, was Charles\r\nClairmont, who was travelling abroad in search, partly of health, partly\r\nof occupation; had found the former, but not the latter, and, of course,\r\nlooked to Shelley as the magician who was to realise all his plans for\r\nhim. Of his discursive letters, which are immensely long, in a style of\r\nflorid eloquence, only a few specimen extracts can find room here. One,\r\nreceived by Shelley and Mary at Geneva, openly confesses that, though it\r\nwas a year since he had left England, he had abstained, as yet, from\r\nwriting to Skinner Street, being as unsettled as ever, and having had\r\nnothing to speak of but his pleasures;--having in short been going on\r\n\"just like a butterfly,--though still as a butterfly of the best\r\nintentions.\" He proceeds to describe the country, his manner of living\r\nthere, his health,--he details his symptoms, and sets forth at length the\r\nvarious projects he might entertain, and the marvellous cheapness of one\r\nand all of them, if only he could afford to have any projects at all. He\r\nenumerates items of expenditure connected with one of his schemes, and\r\nconcludes thus--\r\n\r\n    I lay this proposal before you, without knowing anything of your\r\n    finances, which, I fear, cannot be in too flourishing a situation. You\r\n    will, I trust, consider of the thing, and treat it as frankly as it\r\n    has been offered. I know you too well not to know you would do for me\r\n    all in your power. Have the goodness to write to me as instantly as\r\n    possible.\r\n\r\nAnd Shelley did write,--so says the journal.\r\n\r\nLast not least, there was Clare. At what point of all this time did her\r\nsecret become known to Shelley and Mary? No document as yet has seen the\r\nlight which informs us of this. Perhaps some day it may. Unfortunately for\r\nbiographers and for readers of biography, Mary's journal is almost devoid\r\nof personal gossip, or indeed of personalities of any kind. Her diary is a\r\nrecord of outward facts, and, occasionally, of intellectual impressions;\r\nno intimate history and no one else's affairs are confided to it. No\r\nchange of tone is perceptible anywhere. All that can be asserted is that\r\nthey knew nothing of it when they went to Geneva. In the absence of\r\nabsolute proof to the contrary it is impossible to believe that they were\r\nnot aware of it when they came back. Clare was an expecting mother. For\r\nfour months they had all been in daily intercourse with Byron, who never\r\nwas or could be reticent, and who was not restrained either by delicacy or\r\nconsideration for others from saying what he chose. But when and how the\r\nwhole affair was divulged and what its effect was on Shelley and Mary\r\nremains a mystery. From this time, however, Clare resumed her place as a\r\nmember of their household. It cannot have been a matter of satisfaction to\r\nMary: domestic life was more congenial without Clare's presence than with\r\nit, but now that there was a true reason for her taking shelter with them,\r\nMary's native nobility of heart was equal to the occasion, and she gave\r\nhelp, support, and confidence, ungrudgingly and without stint. Never in\r\nher journal, and only once in her letters does any expression of\r\ndiscontent appear. They settled down together in their lodgings at Bath,\r\nbut on the 19th of September Mary set out to join Shelley at Marlow for a\r\nfew days, leaving Clara in charge of little Willy and the Swiss nurse\r\nElise. On the 25th both were back at Bath, where they resumed their quiet,\r\nregular way of life, resting and reading. But this apparent peace was not\r\nto be long unbroken. Letters from Fanny followed each other in quick\r\nsuccession, breathing nothing but painful, perpetual anxiety.\r\n\r\n    FANNY TO MARY.\r\n\r\n    _26th September 1816._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MARY--I received your letter last Saturday, which rejoiced my\r\n    heart. I cannot help envying your calm, contented disposition, and\r\n    the calm philosophical habits of life which pursue you, or rather\r\n    which you pursue everywhere. I allude to your description of the\r\n    manner in which you pass your days at Bath, when most women would\r\n    hardly have recovered from the fatigues of such a journey as you had\r\n    been taking. I am delighted to hear such pleasing accounts of your\r\n    William; I should like to see him, dear fellow; the change of air does\r\n    him infinite good, no doubt. I am very glad you have got Jane a\r\n    pianoforte; if anything can do her good and restore her to industry,\r\n    it is music. I think I gave her all the music here; however, I will\r\n    look again for what I can find. I am angry with Shelley for not giving\r\n    me an account of his health. All that I saw of him gave me great\r\n    uneasiness about him, and as I see him but seldom, I am much more\r\n    alarmed perhaps than you, who are constantly with him. I hope that it\r\n    is only the London air which does not agree with him, and that he is\r\n    now much better; however, it would have been kind to have said so.\r\n\r\n    Aunt Everina and Mrs. Bishop left London two days ago. It pained me\r\n    very much to find that they have entirely lost their little income\r\n    from Primrose Street, which is very hard upon them at their age. Did\r\n    Shelley tell you a singular story about Mrs. B. having received an\r\n    annuity which will make up in part for her loss?\r\n\r\n    Poor Papa is going on with his novel, though I am sure it is very\r\n    fatiguing to him, though he will not allow it; he is not able to study\r\n    as much as formerly without injuring himself; this, joined to the\r\n    plagues of his affairs, which he fears will never be closed, make me\r\n    very anxious for him. The name of his novel is _Mandeville, or a Tale\r\n    of the Seventeenth Century_. I think, however, you had better not\r\n    mention the name to any one, as he wishes it not to be announced at\r\n    present. Tell Shelley, as soon as he knows certainly about Longdill,\r\n    to write, that he may be eased on that score, for it is a great weight\r\n    on his spirits at present. Mr. Owen is come to town to prepare for the\r\n    meeting of Parliament. There never was so devoted a being as he is;\r\n    and it certainly must end in his doing a great deal of good, though\r\n    not the good he talks of.\r\n\r\n    Have you heard from Charles? He has never given us a single line. I am\r\n    afraid he is doing very ill, and has the conscience not to write a\r\n    parcel of lies. Beg the favour of Shelley, to copy for me his poem on\r\n    the scenes at the foot of Mont Blanc, and tell him or remind him of a\r\n    letter which you said he had written on these scenes; you cannot think\r\n    what a treasure they would be to me; remember you promised them to me\r\n    when you returned to England. Have you heard from Lord Byron since he\r\n    visited those sublime scenes? I have had great pleasure since I saw\r\n    Shelley in going over a fine gallery of pictures of the Old Masters at\r\n    Dulwich. There was a St. Sebastian by Guido, the finest picture I ever\r\n    saw; there were also the finest specimens of Murillo, the great\r\n    Spanish painter, to be found in England, and two very fine Titians.\r\n    But the works of art are not to be compared to the works of nature,\r\n    and I am never satisfied. It is only poets that are eternal\r\n    benefactors of their fellow-creatures, and the real ones never fail of\r\n    giving us the highest degree of pleasure we are capable of; they are,\r\n    in my opinion, nature and art united, and as such never fading.\r\n\r\n    Do write to me immediately, and tell me you have got a house, and\r\n    answer those questions I asked you at the beginning of this letter.\r\n\r\n    Give my love to Shelley, and kiss William for me. Your affectionate\r\n    Sister,\r\n\r\n      FANNY.\r\n\r\nWhen Shelley sold to his father the reversion of a part of his\r\ninheritance, he had promised to Godwin a sum of L300, which he had hoped\r\nto save from the money thus obtained. Owing to certain conditions attached\r\nto the transaction by Sir Timothy Shelley, this proved to be impossible.\r\nThe utmost Shelley could do, and that only by leaving himself almost\r\nwithout resources, was to send something over L200; a bitter\r\ndisappointment to Godwin, who had given a bill for the full amount.\r\nShelley had perhaps been led by his hopes, and his desire to serve Godwin,\r\nto speak in too sanguine a tone as to his prospect of obtaining the money,\r\nand the letter announcing his failure came, Fanny wrote, \"like a\r\nthunderclap.\" In her disappointment she taxed Shelley with want of\r\nfrankness, and Shelley and Mary both with an apparent wish to avoid the\r\nsubject of Godwin's affairs.\r\n\r\n    \"You know,\" she writes, \"the peculiar temperature of Papa's mind (if I\r\n    may so express myself); you know he cannot write when pecuniary\r\n    circumstances overwhelm him; you know that it is of the utmost\r\n    consequence, for _his own_ and the _world's sake_ that he should\r\n    finish his novel; and is it not your and Shelley's duty to consider\r\n    these things, and to endeavour to prevent, as far as lies in your\r\n    power, giving him unnecessary pain and anxiety?\"\r\n\r\nTo the Shelleys, who had strained every nerve to obtain this money,\r\nunmindful of the insulting manner in which such assistance was demanded\r\nand received by Godwin, these appeals to their sense of duty must have\r\nbeen exasperating. Nor were matters mended by hearing of sundry scandalous\r\nreports abroad concerning themselves--reports sedulously gathered by Mrs.\r\nGodwin, and of which Fanny thought it her duty to inform them, so as to\r\nput them on their guard. They, on their part, were indignant, especially\r\nwith Mrs. Godwin, who had evidently, they surmised, gone out of her way\r\nto collect this false information, and had helped rather than hindered its\r\ncirculation; and they expressed themselves to this effect. Fanny stoutly\r\ndefended her stepmother against these attacks.\r\n\r\n    Mamma and I are not great friends, but, always alive to her virtues, I\r\n    am anxious to defend her from a charge so foreign to her character....\r\n    I told Shelley these (scandalous reports), and I still think they\r\n    originated with your servants and Harriet, whom I know has been very\r\n    industrious in spreading false reports about you. I at the same time\r\n    advised Shelley always to keep French servants, and he then seemed to\r\n    think it a good plan. You are very careless, and are for ever leaving\r\n    your letters about. English servants like nothing so much as scandal\r\n    and gossip; but this you know as well as I, and this is the origin of\r\n    the stories that are told. And this you choose to father on Mamma, who\r\n    (whatever she chooses to say in a passion to me alone) is the woman\r\n    the most incapable of such low conduct. I do not say that her\r\n    inferences are always the most just or the most amiable, but they are\r\n    always confined to myself and Papa. Depend upon it you are perfectly\r\n    safe as long as you keep your French servant with you.... I have now\r\n    to entreat you, Shelley, to tell Papa exactly what you can and what\r\n    you cannot do, for he does not seem to know what you mean in your\r\n    letter. I know that you are most anxious to do everything in your\r\n    power to complete your engagement to him, and to do anything that will\r\n    not ruin yourself to save him; but he is not convinced of this, and I\r\n    think it essential to his peace that he should be convinced of this. I\r\n    do not on any account wish you to give him false hopes. Forgive me if\r\n    I have expressed myself unkindly. My heart is warm in your cause, and\r\n    I am _anxious, most anxious_, that Papa should feel for you as I do,\r\n    both for your own and his sake.... All that I have said about Mamma\r\n    proceeds from the hatred I have of talking and petty scandal, which,\r\n    though trifling in itself, often does superior persons much injury,\r\n    though it cannot proceed from any but vulgar souls in the first\r\n    instance.\r\n\r\nThis letter was crossed by Shelley's, enclosing more than\r\nL200--insufficient, however, to meet the situation or to raise the heavy\r\nveil of gloom which had settled on Skinner Street. Fanny could bear it no\r\nlonger. Despairing gloom from Godwin, whom she loved, and who in his gloom\r\nwas no philosopher; sordid, nagging, angry gloom from \"Mamma,\" who,\r\nclearly enough, did not scruple to remind the poor girl that she had been\r\na charge and a burden to the household (this may have been one of the\r\nthings she only \"chose to say in a passion, to Fanny alone\"); her sisters\r\ngone, and neither of them in complete sympathy with her; no friends to\r\ncheer or divert her thoughts! A plan had been under consideration for her\r\nresiding with her relatives in Ireland, and the last drop of bitterness\r\nwas the refusal of her aunt, Everina Wollstonecraft, to have her. What was\r\nleft for her? Much, if she could have believed it, and have nerved herself\r\nto patience. But she was broken down and blinded by the strain of over\r\nendurance. On the 9th of October she disappeared from home. Shelley and\r\nMary in Bath suspected nothing of the impending crisis. The journal for\r\nthat week is as follows--\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, October 5_ (Mary).--Read Clarendon and Curtius; walk with\r\n    Shelley. Shelley reads Tasso.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, October 6_ (Shelley).--On this day Mary put her head through\r\n    the door and said, \"Come and look; here's a cat eating roses; she'll\r\n    turn into a woman; when beasts eat these roses they turn into men and\r\n    women.\"\r\n\r\n    (Mary).--Read Clarendon all day; finish the eleventh book. Shelley\r\n    reads Tasso.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, October 7._--Read Curtius and Clarendon; write. Shelley reads\r\n    _Don Quixote_ aloud in the evening.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, October 8._--Letter from Fanny (this letter has not been\r\n    preserved). Drawing lesson. Walk out with Shelley to the South Parade;\r\n    read Clarendon, and draw. In the evening work, and Shelley reads _Don\r\n    Quixote_; afterwards read _Memoirs of the Princess of Bareith_ aloud.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, October 9._--Read Curtius; finish the _Memoirs_; draw. In\r\n    the evening a very alarming letter comes from Fanny. Shelley goes\r\n    immediately to Bristol; we sit up for him till 2 in the morning, when\r\n    he returns, but brings no particular news.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, October 10._--Shelley goes again to Bristol, and obtains\r\n    more certain trace. Work and read. He returns at 11 o'clock.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, October 11._--He sets off to Swansea. Work and read.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, October 12._--He returns with the worst account. A\r\n    miserable day. Two letters from Papa. Buy mourning, and work in the\r\n    evening.\r\n\r\nFrom Bristol Fanny had written not only to the Shelleys, but to the\r\nGodwins, accounting for her disappearance, and adding, \"I depart\r\nimmediately to the spot from which I hope never to remove.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the ensuing night, at the Mackworth Arms Inn, Swansea, she traced\r\nthe following words--\r\n\r\n    I have long determined that the best thing I could do was to put an\r\n    end to the existence of a being whose birth was unfortunate, and whose\r\n    life has only been a series of pain to those persons who have hurt\r\n    their health in endeavouring to promote her welfare. Perhaps to hear\r\n    of my death may give you pain, but you will soon have the blessing of\r\n    forgetting that such a creature ever existed as....\r\n\r\nThis note and a laudanum bottle were beside her when, next morning, she\r\nwas found lying dead.\r\n\r\nThe persons for whose sake it was--so she had persuaded herself--that she\r\ncommitted this act were reduced to a wretched condition by the blow.\r\nShelley's health was shattered; Mary profoundly miserable; Clare, although\r\nby her own avowal feeling less affection for Fanny than might have been\r\nexpected, was shocked by the dreadful manner of her death, and infected by\r\nthe contagion of the general gloom. She was not far from her confinement,\r\nand had reasons enough of her own for any amount of depression.\r\n\r\nGodwin was deeply afflicted; to him Fanny was a great and material loss,\r\nand the last remaining link with a happy past. As usual, public comment\r\nwas the thing of all others from which he shrank most, and in the midst of\r\nhis first sorrow his chief anxiety was to hide or disguise the painful\r\nstory from the world. In writing (for the first time) to Mary he says--\r\n\r\n    Do not expose us to those idle questions which, to a mind in anguish,\r\n    is one of the severest of all trials. We are at this moment in doubt\r\n    whether, during the first shock, we shall not say that she is gone to\r\n    Ireland to her aunt, a thing that had been in contemplation. Do not\r\n    take from us the power to exercise our own discretion. You shall hear\r\n    again to-morrow.\r\n\r\n    What I have most of all in horror is the public papers, and I thank\r\n    you for your caution, as it may act on this.\r\n\r\n    We have so conducted ourselves that not one person in our home has the\r\n    smallest apprehension of the truth. Our feelings are less tumultuous\r\n    than deep. God only knows what they may become.\r\n\r\nCharles Clairmont was not informed at all of Fanny's death; a letter from\r\nhim a year later contains a message to her. Mrs. Godwin busied herself\r\nwith putting the blame on Shelley. Four years later she informed Mrs.\r\nGisborne that the three girls had been simultaneously in love with\r\nShelley, and that Fanny's death was due to jealousy of Mary! This shows\r\nthat the Shelleys' instinct did not much mislead them when they held\r\nMary's stepmother responsible for the authorship and diffusion of many of\r\nthose slanders which for years were to affect their happiness and peace.\r\nAny reader of Fanny's letters can judge how far Mrs. Godwin's allegation\r\nis borne out by actual facts; and to any one knowing aught of women and\r\nwomen's lives these letters afford clue enough to the situation and the\r\nstory, and further explanation is superfluous. Fanny was fond of Shelley,\r\nfond enough even to forgive him for the trouble he had brought on their\r\nhome, but her part was throughout that of a long-suffering sister, one,\r\ntoo, to whose lot it always fell to say all the disagreeable things that\r\nhad to be said--a truly ungrateful task. Her loyalty to the Godwins,\r\nthough it could not entirely divide her from the Shelleys, could and did\r\nprevent any intimacy of friendship with them. Her enlightened, liberal\r\nmind, and her generous, loving heart had won Shelley's recognition and his\r\naffection, and in a moment a veil was torn from his eyes, revealing to him\r\nunsuspected depths of suffering, sacrifice, and heroism--now it was too\r\nlate. How much more they might have done for Fanny had they understood\r\nwhat she endured! There was he, Shelley, offering sympathy and help to the\r\noppressed and the miserable all the world over, and here,--here under his\r\nvery eyes, this tragic romance was acted out to the death.\r\n\r\n  Her voice did quiver as we parted,\r\n  Yet knew I not that heart was broken\r\n  From which it came,--and I departed,\r\n  Heeding not the words then spoken--\r\n      Misery, ah! misery!\r\n  This world is all too wide for thee.\r\n\r\nIf the echo of those lines reached Fanny in the world of shadows, it may\r\nhave calmed the restless spirit with the knowledge that she had not lived\r\nfor nothing after all.\r\n\r\nDuring the next two months another tragedy was silently advancing towards\r\nits final catastrophe. Shelley was anxious for intelligence of Harriet and\r\nher children; she had, however, disappeared, and he could discover no\r\nclue to her whereabouts. Mr. Peacock, who, during June, had been in\r\ncommunication with her on money matters, had now, apparently, lost sight\r\nof her. The worry of Godwin's money-matters and the fearful shock of\r\nFanny's self-sought death, followed as it was by collapse of his own\r\nhealth and nerves, probably withdrew Shelley's thoughts from the subject\r\nfor a time. In November, however, he wrote to Hookham, thinking that he,\r\nto whom Harriet had once written to discover Shelley's whereabouts, might\r\nnow know or have the means of finding out where she was living. No answer\r\ncame, however, to these inquiries for some weeks, during which Shelley,\r\nMary, and Clare lived in their seclusion, reading Lucian and Horace,\r\nShakespeare, Gibbon, and Locke; in occasional correspondence with Skinner\r\nStreet, through Mrs. Godwin, who was now trying what she could do to\r\nobtain money loans (probably raised on Shelley's prospects), requisite,\r\nnot only to save Godwin from bankruptcy, but to repay Shelley a small\r\nfraction of what he had given and lent, and without which he was unable to\r\npay his own way.\r\n\r\nThe plan for settling at Marlow was still pending, and on the 5th of\r\nDecember Shelley went there again to stay with Mr. Peacock and his mother,\r\nand to look about for a residence to suit him. Mary during his absence was\r\nsomewhat tormented by anxiety for his fragile health; fearful, too, lest\r\nin his impulsive way he should fall in love with the first pretty place he\r\nsaw, and burden himself with some unsuitable house, in the idea of\r\nsettling there \"for ever,\" Clare and all. To that last plan she probably\r\nforesaw the objections more clearly than Shelley did. But her cheery\r\nletters are girlish and playful.\r\n\r\n    _5th December 1816._\r\n\r\n    SWEET ELF--I got up very late this morning, so that I could not attend\r\n    Mr. West. I don't know any more. Good-night.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NEW BOND STREET, BATH,\r\n    _6th December 1816_.\r\n\r\n    SWEET ELF--I was awakened this morning by my pretty babe, and was\r\n    dressed time enough to take my lesson from Mr. West, and (thank God)\r\n    finished that tedious ugly picture I have been so long about. I have\r\n    also finished the fourth chapter of _Frankenstein_, which is a very\r\n    long one, and I think you would like it. And where are you? and what\r\n    are you doing? my blessed love. I hope and trust that, for my sake,\r\n    you did not go outside this wretched day, while the wind howls and the\r\n    clouds seem to threaten rain. And what did my love think of as he rode\r\n    along--did he think about our home, our babe, and his poor Pecksie?\r\n    But I am sure you did, and thought of them all with joy and hope. But\r\n    in the choice of a residence, dear Shelley, pray be not too quick or\r\n    attach yourself too much to one spot. Ah! were you indeed a winged\r\n    Elf, and could soar over mountains and seas, and could pounce on the\r\n    little spot. A house with a lawn, a river or lake, noble trees, and\r\n    divine mountains, that should be our little mouse-hole to retire to.\r\n    But never mind this; give me a garden, and _absentia_ Claire, and I\r\n    will thank my love for many favours. If you, my love, go to London,\r\n    you will perhaps try to procure a good Livy, for I wish very much to\r\n    read it. I must be more industrious, especially in learning Latin,\r\n    which I neglected shamefully last summer at intervals, and those\r\n    periods of not reading at all put me back very far.\r\n\r\n    The _Morning Chronicle_, as you will see, does not make much of the\r\n    riots, which they say are entirely quelled, and you would be almost\r\n    inclined to say, \"Out of the mountain comes forth a mouse,\" although,\r\n    I daresay, poor Mrs. Platt does not think so.\r\n\r\n    The blue eyes of your sweet Boy are staring at me while I write this;\r\n    he is a dear child, and you love him tenderly, although I fancy that\r\n    your affection will increase when he has a nursery to himself, and\r\n    only comes to you just dressed and in good humour; besides when that\r\n    comes to pass he will be a wise little man, for he improves in mind\r\n    rapidly. Tell me, shall you be happy to have another little squaller?\r\n    You will look grave on this, but I do not mean anything.\r\n\r\n    Leigh Hunt has not written. I would advise a letter addressed to him\r\n    at the _Examiner_ Office, if there is no answer to-morrow. He may not\r\n    be at the Vale of Health, for it is odd that he does not acknowledge\r\n    the receipt of so large a sum. There have been no letters of any kind\r\n    to-day.\r\n\r\n    Now, my dear, when shall I see you? Do not be very long away; take\r\n    care of yourself and take a house. I have a great fear that bad\r\n    weather will set in. My airy Elf, how unlucky you are! I shall write\r\n    to Mrs. Godwin to-morrow; but let me know what you hear from Hayward\r\n    and papa, as I am greatly interested in those affairs. Adieu,\r\n    sweetest; love me tenderly, and think of me with affection when\r\n    anything pleases you greatly.--Your affectionate girl\r\n\r\n      MARY.\r\n\r\n    I have not asked Clare, but I dare say she would send her love,\r\n    although I dare say she would scold you well if you were here.\r\n    Compliments and remembrances to Dame Peacock and Son, but do not let\r\n    them see this.\r\n\r\n    Sweet, adieu!\r\n\r\n    Percy B. Shelley, Esq.,\r\n    Great Marlow, Bucks.\r\n\r\nOn 6th December the journal records--\r\n\r\n    Letter from Shelley; he has gone to visit Leigh Hunt.\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of a lifelong intimacy.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th Shelley returned to Bath, and on the very next day a letter\r\nfrom Hookham informed him that on the 9th Harriet's body had been taken\r\nout of the Serpentine. She had disappeared three weeks before that time\r\nfrom the house where she was living. An inquest had been held at which her\r\nname was given as Harriet Smith; little or no information about her was\r\ngiven to the jury, who returned a verdict of \"Found drowned.\"\r\n\r\nLife and its complications had proved too much for the poor silly woman,\r\nand she took the only means of escape she saw open to her. Her piteous\r\nstory was sufficiently told by the fact that when she drowned herself she\r\nwas not far from her confinement. But it would seem from subsequent\r\nevidence that harsh treatment on the part of her relatives was what\r\nfinally drove her to despair. She had lived a fast life, but had been,\r\nnominally at any rate, under her father's protection until a comparatively\r\nshort time before her disappearance, when some act or occurrence caused\r\nher to be driven from his house. From that moment she sank lower and\r\nlower, until at last, deserted by one--said to be a groom--to whom she had\r\nlooked for protection, she killed herself.\r\n\r\nIt is asserted that she had had, all her life, an avowed proclivity to\r\nsuicide. She had been fond, in young and happy days, of talking jocosely\r\nabout it, as silly girls often do; discoursing of \"some scheme of\r\nself-destruction as coolly as another lady would arrange a visit to an\r\nexhibition or a theatre.\"[22] But it is a wide dreary waste that lies\r\nbetween such an idea and the grim reality,--and poor Harriet had traversed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nShelley's first thought on receiving the fatal news was of his children.\r\nHis sensations were those of horror, not of remorse. He never spoke or\r\nthought of Harriet with harshness, rather with infinite pity, but he never\r\nregarded her save in the light of one who had wronged him and failed\r\nhim,--whom he had left, indeed, but had forgiven, and had tried to save\r\nfrom the worst consequences of her own acts. Her dreadful death was a\r\nshock to him of which he said (to Byron) that he knew not how he had\r\nsurvived it; and he regarded her father and sister as guilty of her blood.\r\nBut Fanny's death caused him acuter anguish than Harriet's did.\r\n\r\nAs for Mary, she regarded the whole Westbrook family as the source of\r\ngrief and shame to Shelley. Harriet she only knew for a frivolous,\r\nheartless, faithless girl, whom she had never had the faintest cause to\r\nrespect, hardly even to pity. Poor Harriet was indeed deserving of\r\nprofound commiseration, and no one could have known and felt this more\r\nthan Mary would have done, in later years. But she heard one side of the\r\ncase only, and that one the side on which her own strongest feelings were\r\nengaged. She was only nineteen, with an exalted ideal of womanly devotion;\r\nand at nineteen we may sternly judge what later on we may condemn indeed,\r\nbut with a depth of pity quite beyond the power of its object to fathom or\r\ncomprehend.\r\n\r\nNo comment whatever on the occurrence appears in her journal. She threw\r\nherself ardently into Shelley's eagerness to get possession of his elder\r\nchildren; ready, for his sake, to love them as her own.\r\n\r\nIt could not but occur to her that her own position was altered by this\r\nevent, and that nothing now stood between her and her legal marriage to\r\nShelley and acknowledgment as his wife. So completely, however, did they\r\nregard themselves as united for all time by indissoluble ties that she\r\nthought of the change chiefly as it affected other people.\r\n\r\n    MARY TO SHELLEY.\r\n\r\n    BATH, _17th December 1816_.\r\n\r\n    MY BELOVED FRIEND--I waited with the greatest anxiety for your letter.\r\n    You are well, and that assurance has restored some peace to me.\r\n\r\n    How very happy shall I be to possess those darling treasures that are\r\n    yours. I do not exactly understand what Chancery has to do in this,\r\n    and wait with impatience for to-morrow, when I shall hear whether they\r\n    are with you; and then what will you do with them? My heart says,\r\n    bring them instantly here; but I submit to your prudence. You do not\r\n    mention Godwin. When I receive your letter to-morrow I shall write to\r\n    Mrs. Godwin. I hope, yet I fear, that he will show on this occasion\r\n    some disinterestedness. Poor, dear Fanny, if she had lived until this\r\n    moment she would have been saved, for my house would then have been a\r\n    proper asylum for her. Ah! my best love, to you do I owe every joy,\r\n    every perfection that I may enjoy or boast of. Love me, sweet, for\r\n    ever. I hardly know what I mean, I am so much agitated. Clare has a\r\n    very bad cough, but I think she is better to-day. Mr. Carn talks of\r\n    bleeding if she does not recover quickly, but she is positively\r\n    resolved not to submit to that. She sends her love. My sweet love,\r\n    deliver some message from me to your kind friends at Hampstead; tell\r\n    Mrs. Hunt that I am extremely obliged to her for the little profile\r\n    she was so kind as to send me, and thank Mr. Hunt for his friendly\r\n    message which I did not hear.\r\n\r\n    These Westbrooks! But they have nothing to do with your sweet babes;\r\n    they are yours, and I do not see the pretence for a suit; but\r\n    to-morrow I shall know all.\r\n\r\n    Your box arrived to-day. I shall send soon to the upholsterer, for now\r\n    I long more than ever that our house should be quickly ready for the\r\n    reception of those dear children whom I love so tenderly. Then there\r\n    will be a sweet brother and sister for my William, who will lose his\r\n    pre-eminence as eldest, and be helped third at table, as Clare is\r\n    continually reminding him.\r\n\r\n    Come down to me, sweetest, as soon as you can, for I long to see you\r\n    and embrace.\r\n\r\n    As to the event you allude to, be governed by your friends and\r\n    prudence as to when it ought to take place, but it must be in London.\r\n\r\n    Clare has just looked in; she begs you not to stay away long, to be\r\n    more explicit in your letters, and sends her love.\r\n\r\n    You tell me to write a long letter, and I would, but that my ideas\r\n    wander and my hand trembles. Come back to reassure me, my Shelley, and\r\n    bring with you your darling Ianthe and Charles. Thank your kind\r\n    friends. I long to hear about Godwin.--Your affectionate\r\n\r\n      MARY.\r\n\r\n    Have you called on Hogg? I would hardly advise you. Remember me,\r\n    sweet, in your sorrows as well as your pleasures; they will, I trust,\r\n    soften the one and heighten the other feeling. Adieu.\r\n\r\n    To Percy Bysshe Shelley,\r\n    5 Gray's Inn Square, London.\r\n\r\nNo time was lost in putting things on their legal footing. Shelley took\r\nMary up to town, where the marriage ceremony took place at St. Mildred's\r\nChurch, Broad Street, in presence of Godwin and Mrs. Godwin. On the\r\nprevious day he had seen his daughter for the first time since her flight\r\nfrom his house two and a half years before.\r\n\r\nBoth must have felt a strange emotion which, probably, neither of them\r\nallowed to appear.\r\n\r\nMary for a fortnight left a blank in her journal. On her return to Clifton\r\nshe thus shortly chronicled her days--\r\n\r\n    I have omitted writing my journal for some time. Shelley goes to\r\n    London and returns; I go with him; spend the time between Leigh Hunt's\r\n    and Godwin's. A marriage takes place on the 29th of December 1816.\r\n    Draw; read Lord Chesterfield and Locke.\r\n\r\nGodwin's relief and satisfaction were great indeed. His letter to his\r\nbrother in the country, announcing his daughter's recent marriage with a\r\nbaronet's eldest son, can only be compared for adroit manipulation of\r\nfacts with a later letter to Mr. Baxter of Dundee, in which he tells of\r\npoor Fanny's having been attacked in Wales by an inflammatory fever \"which\r\ncarried her off.\"\r\n\r\nHe now surpassed himself \"in polished and cautious attentions\" both to\r\nShelley and Mary, and appeared to wish to compensate in every way for the\r\nred-hot, righteous indignation which, owing to wounded pride rather than\r\nto offended moral sense, he had thought it his duty to exhibit in the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nShelley's heart yearned towards his two poor little children by Harriet,\r\nand to get possession of them was now his feverish anxiety. On this\r\nbusiness he was obliged, within a week of his return to Bath, to go up\r\nagain to London. During his absence, on the 13th of January, Clare's\r\nlittle girl, Byron's daughter, was born. \"Four days of idleness,\" are\r\nMary's only allusion to this event. It was communicated to the absent\r\nfather by Shelley, in a long letter from London. He quite simply assumes\r\nthe event to be an occasion of great rejoicing to all concerned, and\r\nexpects Byron to feel the same. The infant, who afterwards developed into\r\na singularly fascinating and lovely child, was described in enthusiastic\r\nterms by Mary as unusually beautiful and intelligent, even at this early\r\nstage. Their first name for her was Alba, or \"the Dawn\"; a reminiscence of\r\nByron's nickname, \"Albe.\"\r\n\r\nMost of this month of January, while Mary had Clare and the infant to look\r\nafter, was of necessity spent by Shelley in London. Harriet's father, Mr.\r\nWestbrook, and his daughter Eliza had filed an appeal to the Court of\r\nChancery, praying that her children might be placed in the custody of\r\nguardians to be appointed by the Court, and not in that of their father.\r\nOn 24th January, poor little William's first birthday, the case was heard\r\nbefore Lord Chancellor Eldon. Mary, expecting that the decision would be\r\nknown at once, waited in painful suspense to hear the result.\r\n\r\n    _Journal, Friday, January 24._--My little William's birthday. How many\r\n    changes have occurred during this little year; may the ensuing one be\r\n    more peaceful, and my William's star be a fortunate one to rule the\r\n    decision of this day. Alas! I fear it will be put off, and the\r\n    influence of the star pass away. Read the _Arcadia_ and _Amadis_; walk\r\n    with my sweet babe.\r\n\r\nHer fears were realised, for two months were to elapse ere judgment was\r\npronounced.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, January 25._--An unhappy day. I receive bad news and\r\n    determine to go up to London. Read the _Arcadia_ and _Amadis_. Letter\r\n    from Mrs. Godwin and William.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, next day, Mary went up to join her husband in town, and notes\r\nin her diary that she was met at the inn by Mrs. Godwin and William. Well\r\nmight Shelley say of the ceremony that it was \"magical in its effects.\"\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, this was her final departure from Bath: she never\r\nreturned there. On her arrival in London she was warmly welcomed by\r\nShelley's new friends, the Leigh Hunts, at whose house most of her time\r\nwas spent, and whose genial, social circle was most refreshing to her. The\r\nhouse at Marlow had been taken, and was now being prepared for her\r\nreception. Little William and his nurse, escorted by Clare, joined her at\r\nthe Hunts on the 18th of February, but Clare herself stayed elsewhere. At\r\nthe end of the month they all departed for their new home, and were\r\nestablished there early in March.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nMARCH 1817-MARCH 1818\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Shelleys' new abode, although situated in a lovely part of the\r\ncountry, was cold and cheerless, and, at that bleak time of year, must\r\nhave appeared at its worst. Albion House stood (and, though subdivided and\r\nmuch altered in appearance, still stands) in what is now the main street\r\nof Great Marlow, and at a considerable distance from the river. At the\r\nback the garden-plot rises gradually from the level of the house,\r\nterminating in a kind of artificial mound, overshadowed by a spreading\r\ncedar; a delightfully shady lounge in summer, but shutting off sky and\r\nsunshine from the house. There are two large, low, old-fashioned rooms;\r\none on the ground floor, somewhat like a farmhouse kitchen; the other\r\nabove it; both facing towards the garden. In one of these Shelley fitted\r\nup a library, little thinking that the dwelling, which he had rashly taken\r\non a more than twenty years' lease, would be his home for only a year. The\r\nrest of the house accommodated Mary, Clare, the children and servants,\r\nand left plenty of room for visitors. Shelley was hospitality itself, and\r\nthough he never was in greater trouble for money than during this year, he\r\nentertained a constant succession of guests. First among these was Godwin;\r\nnext, and most frequent, the genial but needy Leigh Hunt, with all his\r\nfamily. With Mary, as with Shelley, he had quickly established himself on\r\na footing of easy, affectionate friendliness, as may be inferred from\r\nMary's letter, written to him during her first days at Marlow.\r\n\r\n    MARLOW, _1 o'clock, 5th March 1817_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR HUNT--Although you mistook me in thinking I wished you to\r\n    write about politics in your letters to me--as such a thought was very\r\n    far from me,--yet I cannot help mentioning your last week's\r\n    _Examiner_, as its boldness gave me extreme pleasure. I am very glad\r\n    to find that you wrote the leading article, which I had doubted, as\r\n    there was no significant hand. But though I speak of this, do not fear\r\n    that you will be teased by _me_ on these subjects when we enjoy your\r\n    company at Marlow. When there, you shall never be serious when you\r\n    wish to be merry, and have as many nuts to crack as there are words in\r\n    the Petitions to Parliament for Reform--a tremendous promise.\r\n\r\n    Have you never felt in your succession of nervous feelings one single\r\n    disagreeable truism gain a painful possession of your mind and keep it\r\n    for some months? A year ago, I remember, my private hours were all\r\n    made bitter by reflections on the certainty of death, and now the\r\n    flight of time has the same power over me. Everything passes, and one\r\n    is hardly conscious of enjoying the present until it becomes the past.\r\n    I was reading the other day the letters of Gibbon. He entreats Lord\r\n    Sheffield to come with all his family to visit him at Lausanne, and\r\n    dwells on the pleasure such a visit will occasion. There is a little\r\n    gap in the date of his letters, and then he complains that this\r\n    solitude is made more irksome by their having been there and departed.\r\n    So will it be with us in a few months when you will all have left\r\n    Marlow. But I will not indulge this gloomy feeling. The sun shines\r\n    brightly, and we shall be very happy in our garden this\r\n    summer.--Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n      MARINA.\r\n\r\nNot only did Shelley keep open house for his friends; his kindliness and\r\nbenevolence to the distressed poor in Marlow and the surrounding country\r\nwas unbounded. Nor was he content to give money relief; he visited the\r\ncottagers; and made himself personally acquainted with them, their needs,\r\nand their sufferings.\r\n\r\nIn all these labours of love and charity he was heartily and constantly\r\nseconded by Mary.\r\n\r\n  No more alone through the world's wilderness,\r\n  Although (he) trod the paths of high intent,\r\n  (He) journeyed now.[23]\r\n\r\nFrom the time of her union with him Mary had been his consoler, his\r\ncherished love, all the dearer to him for the thought that she was\r\ndependent on him and only on him for comfort and support, and\r\nenlightenment of mind; but yet she was a child,--a clever child,--sedate\r\nand thoughtful beyond her years, and full of true womanly devotion,--but\r\nstill one whose first and only acquaintance with the world had been made\r\nby coming violently into collision with it, a dangerous experience, and\r\nhardening, especially if prolonged. From the time of her marriage a\r\nmaturer, mellower tone is perceptible throughout her letters and writings,\r\nas though, the unnatural strain removed, and, above all, intercourse with\r\nher father restored, she glided naturally and imperceptibly into the place\r\nNature intended her to fill, as responsible woman and wife, with social as\r\nwell as domestic duties to fulfil.\r\n\r\nThe suffering of the past two or three years had left her wiser if also\r\nsadder than before; already she was beginning to look on life with a calm\r\nliberal judgment of one who knew both sides of many questions, yet still\r\nher mind retained the simplicity and her spirit much of the buoyancy of\r\nyouth. The unquenchable spring of love and enthusiasm in Shelley's breast,\r\nthough it led him into errors and brought him grief and disillusionment,\r\nwas a talisman that saved him from Byronic sarcasm, from the bitterness of\r\nrecoil and the death of stagnation. He suffered from reaction, as all such\r\nnatures must suffer, but Mary was by his side to steady and balance and\r\nsupport him, and to bring to him for his consolation the balm she had\r\nherself received from him. Well might he write--\r\n\r\n  Now has descended a serener hour,\r\n  And, with inconstant fortune, friends return;\r\n  Though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power\r\n  Which says: Let scorn be not repaid with scorn.[24]\r\n\r\nAnd consolation and support were sorely needed. In March Lord Chancellor\r\nEldon pronounced the judgment by which he was deprived, on moral and\r\nreligious grounds, of the custody of his two elder children. How bitterly\r\nhe felt, how keenly he resented, this decree all the world knows. The\r\npaper which he drew up during this celebrated case, in which he declared,\r\nas far as he chose to declare them, his sentiments with regard to his\r\nseparation from Harriet and his union with Mary, is the nearest approach\r\nto self-vindication Shelley ever made. But the decision of the Court cast\r\na slur on his name, and on that of his second wife. The final arrangements\r\nabout the children dragged on for many months. They were eventually given\r\nover to the guardianship of a clergyman, a stranger to their father, who\r\nhad to set aside L200 a year of his income for their maintenance in exile.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Godwin's exactions were incessant, and his demands, sometimes\r\nimpossible to grant, were harder than ever to deal with now that they were\r\ncouched in terms of friendship, almost of affection. On 9th March we find\r\nShelley writing to him--\r\n\r\n    It gives me pain that I cannot send you the whole of what you want. I\r\n    enclose a cheque to within a few pounds of my possessions.\r\n\r\nOn 22d March (Godwin has been begging again, but this time in behalf of\r\nhis old assistant and amanuensis, Marshall)--\r\n\r\n    Marshall's proposal is one in which, however reluctantly, I must\r\n    refuse to engage. It is that I should grant bills to the amount of his\r\n    debts, which are to expire in thirty months.\r\n\r\nOn 15th April Godwin writes on his own behalf--\r\n\r\n    The fact is I owe L400 on a similar score, beyond the L100 that I owed\r\n    in the middle of 1815; and without clearing this, my mind will never\r\n    be perfectly free for intellectual occupations. If this were done, I\r\n    am in hopes that the produce of _Mandeville_, and the sensible\r\n    improvement in the commercial transactions of Skinner Street would\r\n    make me a free man, perhaps, for the rest of my life....\r\n\r\n    My life wears away in lingering sorrow at the endless delays that\r\n    attend on this affair.... Once every two or three months I throw\r\n    myself prostrate beneath the feet of Taylor of Norwich, and my other\r\n    discounting friends, protesting that this is absolutely for the last\r\n    time. Shall this ever have an end? Shall I ever be my own man again?\r\n\r\nOne can imagine how such a letter would work on his daughter's feelings.\r\n\r\nNor was Charles Clairmont backward about putting in his claims, although\r\nhis modest little requests require, like gems, to be extracted carefully\r\nfrom the discursive raptures, the eloquent flights of fancy and poetic\r\ndescription in which they are embedded. In January he had written from\r\nBagneres de Bigorre, where he was \"acquiring the language\"--\r\n\r\n    Sometimes I hardly dare believe, situated as I am, that I ought for a\r\n    moment to nourish the feelings of which I am now going to talk to\r\n    you; at other times I am so thoroughly convinced of their infinite\r\n    utility with regard to the moral existence of a being with strong\r\n    sensations, or at all events with regard to mine, that I fly to this\r\n    subject as to a tranquillising medicine, which has the power of so\r\n    arranging and calming every violent and illicit sensation of the soul\r\n    as to spread over the frame a deep and delightful contentment, for\r\n    such is the effect produced upon me by a contemplation of the perfect\r\n    state of existence, the perfect state of social domestic happiness\r\n    which I propose to myself. My life has hitherto been a tissue of\r\n    irregularity, which I assure you I am little content to reflect\r\n    upon.... I have been always neglectful of one of the most precious\r\n    possessions which a young man can hold--of my character.... You will\r\n    now see the object of this letter.... I desire strongly to marry, and\r\n    to devote myself to the temperate, rational duties of human life.... I\r\n    see, I confess, some objections to this step.... I am not forgetful of\r\n    what I owe to Godwin and my Mother, but we are in a manner entirely\r\n    separated.... It is true my feelings towards my Mother are cold and\r\n    inactive, but my attachment and respect for Godwin are unalterable,\r\n    and will remain so to the last moment of my existence.... The news of\r\n    his death would be to me a stroke of the severest affliction; that of\r\n    my own Mother would be no more than the sorrow occasioned by the loss\r\n    of a common acquaintance.\r\n\r\n    ... Unless every obstacle on the part of the object of my affection\r\n    were laid aside, you may suppose I should not speak so decisively. She\r\n    is perfectly acquainted with every circumstance respecting me, and we\r\n    feel that we love and are suited to each other; we feel that we should\r\n    be exquisitely happy in being devoted to each other.\r\n\r\n    ... I feel that I could not offer myself to the family without\r\n    assuring them of my capability of commanding an annual sufficiency to\r\n    support a little _menage_--that is to say, as near as I can obtain\r\n    information, 2000 francs, or about L80.... Do I dream, my dear\r\n    Shelley, when a gleam of gay hope gives me reason to doubt of the\r\n    possibility of my scheme?... Pray lose no time in writing to me, and\r\n    be as explicit as possible.\r\n\r\nThe following extract is from a letter to Mary, written in August (the\r\nmatrimonial scheme is now quite forgotten)--\r\n\r\n    I will begin by telling you that I received L10 some days ago, minus\r\n    the expenses.... I also received your letter, but not till after the\r\n    money.... I am most extremely vexed that Shelley will not oblige me\r\n    with a single word. It is now nearly six months that I have expected\r\n    from him a letter about my future plans.\r\n\r\n    Do, my dear Mary, persuade him to talk with you about them; and if he\r\n    always persists in remaining silent, I beg you will write for him, and\r\n    ask him what he would be inclined to approve.... Had I a little\r\n    fortune of L200 or L300 a year, nothing should ever tempt me to make\r\n    an effort to increase this golden sufficiency....\r\n\r\n    Respecting money matters.... I still owe (on the score of my\r\n    _pension_) nearly L15, this is all my debt here. Another month will\r\n    accumulate before I can receive your answer, and you will judge of\r\n    what will be necessary to me on the road, to whatever place I may be\r\n    destined. I cannot spend less than 3s. 6d. per day.\r\n\r\n    If Papa's novel is finished before you write, I wish to God you would\r\n    send it. I am now absolutely without money, but I have no occasion for\r\n    any, except for washing and postage, and for such little necessaries I\r\n    find no difficulty in borrowing a small sum.\r\n\r\n    If I knew Mamma's address, I should certainly write to her in France.\r\n    I have no heart to write to Skinner Street, for they will not answer\r\n    my letters. Perhaps, now that this haughty woman is absent, I should\r\n    obtain a letter. I think I shall make an effort with Fanny. As for\r\n    Clare, she has entirely forgotten that she has a brother in the\r\n    world.... Tell me if Godwin has been to visit you at Marlow; if you\r\n    see Fanny often; and all about the two Williams. What is Shelley\r\n    writing?\r\n\r\nShelley, when this letter arrived, was writing _The Revolt of Islam_. To\r\nthis poem, in spite of duns, sponges, and law's delays, his thoughts and\r\ntime were consecrated during his first six months at Marlow; in spite,\r\ntoo, of his constant succession of guests; but society with him was not\r\nalways a hindrance to poetic creation or intellectual work. Indeed, a\r\ncongenial presence afforded him a kind of relief, a half-unconscious\r\nstimulus which yet was no serious interruption to thought, for it was\r\npowerless to recall him from his abstraction.\r\n\r\nMary's life at Marlow was very different from what it had been at\r\nBishopsgate and Bath. Her duties as house-mistress and hostess as well as\r\nShelley's companion and helpmeet left her not much time for reverie. But\r\nher regular habits of study and writing stood her in good stead.\r\n_Frankenstein_ was completed and corrected before the end of May. It was\r\noffered to Murray, who, however, declined it, and was eventually published\r\nby Lackington.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations with publishers calling her up to town, she paid a visit\r\nto Skinner Street. Shelley accompanied her, but was obliged to return to\r\nMarlow almost immediately, and as Mrs. Godwin also appears to have been\r\nabsent, Mary stayed alone with her father in her old home. To him this\r\nwas a pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Such a visit,\" he had written to Shelley, \"will tend to bring back years\r\nthat are passed, and make me young again. It will also operate to render\r\nus more familiar and intimate, meeting in this snug and quiet house, for\r\nsuch it appears to me, though I daresay you will lift up your hands, and\r\nwonder I can give it that appellation.\"\r\n\r\nTo Mary every room in the house must have been fraught with unspeakable\r\nassociations. Alone with the memories of those who were gone, of others\r\nwho were alienated; conscious of the complete change in herself and\r\ntransference of her sphere of sympathy, she must have felt, when Shelley\r\nleft her, like a solitary wanderer in a land of shadows.\r\n\r\n    \"I am very well here,\" she wrote, \"but so intolerably restless that it\r\n    is painful to sit still for five minutes. Pray write. I hear so little\r\n    from Marlow that I can hardly believe that you and Willman live\r\n    there.\"\r\n\r\nAnother train of mingled recollections was awakened by the fact of her\r\nchancing, one evening, to read through that third canto of _Childe Harold_\r\nwhich Byron had written during their summer in Switzerland together.\r\n\r\n    Do you remember, Shelley, when you first read it to me one evening\r\n    after returning from Diodati. The lake was before us, and the mighty\r\n    Jura. That time is past, and this will also pass, when I may weep to\r\n    read these words.... Death will at length come, and in the last\r\n    moment all will be a dream.\r\n\r\nWhat Mary felt was crystallised into expression by Shelley, not many\r\nmonths later--\r\n\r\n  The stream we gazed on then, rolled by,\r\n  Its waves are unreturning;\r\n        But we yet stand\r\n        In a lone land,\r\n  Like tombs to mark the memory\r\n  Of hopes and fears, which fade and flee\r\n  In the light of life's dim morning.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of May, Mary returned to Marlow, where the Hunts were\r\nmaking a long stay. Externally life went quietly on. The summer was hot\r\nand beautiful, and they passed whole days in their boat or their garden,\r\nor in the woods. Their studies, as usual, were unremitting. Mary applied\r\nherself to the works of Tacitus, Buffon, Rousseau, and Gibbon. Shelley's\r\nreading at this time was principally Greek: Homer, Aeschylus, and Plato.\r\nHis poem was approaching completion. Mary, now that _Frankenstein_ was off\r\nher hands, busied herself in writing out the journal of their first\r\ntravels. It was published, in December, as _Journal of a Six Weeks' Tour_,\r\ntogether with the descriptive letters from Geneva of 1816.\r\n\r\nBut her peace and Shelley's was threatened by an undercurrent of ominous\r\ndisturbance which gained force every day.\r\n\r\nByron remained abroad. But Clare and Clare's baby remained with the\r\nShelleys. At Bath she had passed as \"Mrs.\" Clairmont, but now resumed her\r\nformer style, while Alba was said to be the daughter of a friend in\r\nLondon, sent for her health into the country. As time, however, went by,\r\nand the infant still formed one of the Marlow household, curiosity, never\r\nlong dormant, became aroused. Whose was this child? And if, as officious\r\ngossip was not slow to suggest, it was Clare's, then who was its father?\r\nAs month after month passed without bringing any solution of this problem,\r\nthe vilest reports arose concerning the supposed relations of the\r\ninhabitants of Albion House--false rumours that embittered the lives of\r\nAlba's generous protectors, but to which Shelley's unconventionality and\r\nunorthodox opinions, and the stigma attached to his name by the Chancery\r\ndecree, gave a certain colour of probability, and which in part, though\r\nindirectly, conduced to his leaving England again,--as it proved, for\r\never.\r\n\r\nAgain and again did he write to Byron, pointing out with great gentleness\r\nand delicacy, but still in the plainest terms, the false situation in\r\nwhich they were placed with regard to friends and even to servants by\r\ntheir effort to keep Clare's secret; suggesting, almost entreating, that,\r\nif no permanent decision could be arrived at, some temporary arrangement\r\nshould at least be made for Alba's boarding elsewhere. Byron, at this\r\ntime plunged in dissipation at Venice, shelved or avoided the subject as\r\nlong as he could. Clare was friendless and penniless, and her chances of\r\never earning an honest living depended on her power of keeping up\r\nappearances and preserving her character before the world. But the child\r\nwas a remarkably beautiful, intelligent, and engaging creature, and its\r\nmother, impulsive, uncontrolled, and reckless, was at no trouble to\r\nconceal her devotion to it, regardless of consequences, and of the fact\r\nthat these consequences had to be endured by others.\r\n\r\nThose who had forfeited the world's kindness seemed, as such, to be the\r\nnatural _proteges_ of Shelley; and even Mary, who, not long before, had\r\nsummed up all her earthly wishes in two items,--\"a garden, _et absentia\r\nClaire_,\"--stood by her now in spite of all. But their letters make it\r\nperfectly evident that they were fully alive to the danger that threatened\r\nthem, and that, though they willingly harboured the child until some safe\r\nand fitting asylum should be found for it, they had never contemplated its\r\nresiding permanently with them.\r\n\r\nTo Mary Shelley this state of things brought one bitter personal grief and\r\ndisappointment in the loss of her earliest friend, Isabel or Isobel\r\nBaxter, now married to Mr. David Booth, late brewer and subsequently\r\nschoolmaster at Newburgh-on-Tay, a man of shrewd and keen intellect, an\r\nimmense local reputation for learning, and an estimation of his own gifts\r\nsecond to that of none of his admirers.\r\n\r\nThe Baxters, as has already been said, were people of independent mind, of\r\nbroad and liberal views; full of reverence and admiration for the\r\nphilosophical writings of Godwin. Mary, in her extreme youth and\r\ninexperience, had quite expected that Isabel would have upheld her action\r\nwhen she first left her father's house with Shelley. In that she was\r\ndisappointed, as was, after all, not surprising.\r\n\r\nNow, however, her friend, whose heart must have been with her all along,\r\nwould surely feel justified in following that heart's dictates, and would\r\nreturn to the familiar, affectionate friendship which survives so many\r\ndifferences of opinion. And her hope received an encouragement when, in\r\nAugust, Mr. Baxter, Isabel's father, accepted an invitation to stay at\r\nMarlow. He arrived on the 1st of September, full of doubts as to what sort\r\nof place he was coming to,--apprehensions which, after a very short\r\nintercourse with Shelley, were changed into surprise and delight.\r\n\r\nBut his visit was cut short by the birth, on the very next day, of Mary's\r\nlittle girl, Clara. He found it expedient to depart for a time, but\r\nreturned later in the month for a longer stay.\r\n\r\nThis second visit more than confirmed his first impression, and he wrote\r\nto his daughter in warm, nay, enthusiastic praise of Shelley, against whom\r\nIsabel was, not unnaturally, much prejudiced, so much so, it seems, as to\r\nblind her even to the merits of his writings.\r\n\r\nAfter a warm panegyric of Shelley as\r\n\r\n    A being of rare genius and talent, of truly republican frugality and\r\n    plainness of manners, and of a soundness of principle and delicacy of\r\n    moral tact that might put to shame (if shame they had) many of his\r\n    detractors,--and withal so amiable that you have only to be half an\r\n    hour in his company to convince you that there is not an atom of\r\n    malevolence in his whole composition.\r\n\r\nMr. Baxter proceeds--\r\n\r\n    Is there any wonder that I should become attached to such a man,\r\n    holding out the hand of kindness and friendship towards me? Certainly\r\n    not. Your praise of his book[25] put me in mind of what Pope says of\r\n    Addison--\r\n\r\n      Damn with faint praise; assent with civil leer,\r\n      And, without sneering, others teach to sneer.\r\n\r\n    [You say] \"some parts appear to be well written, but the arguments\r\n    appear to me to be neither new nor very well managed.\" After Hume such\r\n    a publication is quite puerile! As to the arguments not being new, it\r\n    would be a wonder indeed if any new arguments could be adduced in a\r\n    controversy which has been carried on almost since ever letters were\r\n    known. As to their not being well managed, I should be happy if you\r\n    would condescend on the particular instances of their being ill\r\n    managed; it was the first of Shelley's works I had read. I read it\r\n    with the notion that it _could_ only contain silly, crude, undigested\r\n    and puerile remarks on a worn-out subject; and yet I was unable to\r\n    discover any of that want of management which you complain of; but,\r\n    God help me, I thought I saw in it everything that was opposite. As\r\n    to its being puerile to write on such a subject after David Hume, I by\r\n    no means think that he has exhausted the subject. I think rather that\r\n    he has only proposed it--thrown it out, as it were, for a matter of\r\n    discussion to others who might come after him, and write in a less\r\n    bigoted, more liberal, and more enlightened age than the one he lived\r\n    in. Think only how many great men's labours we should decree to be\r\n    puerile if we were to hold everything puerile that has been written on\r\n    this subject since the days of Hume! Indeed, my dear, the remark\r\n    altogether savours more of the envy and illiberality of one jealous of\r\n    his talents than the frankness and candour characteristic of my\r\n    Isobel. Think, my dear, think for a moment what you would have said of\r\n    this work had it come from Robert,[26] who is as old as Shelley was\r\n    when he wrote it, or had it come from me, or even from----O! I must\r\n    not say David:[27] he, to be sure, is far above any such puerility.\r\n\r\nHer father's letter made Isabel waver, but in vain. It had no effect on\r\nMr. Booth, who had been at the trouble of collecting and believing all the\r\nscandals about Alba, or \"Miss Auburn,\" as she seems to have been called.\r\nHe was not one to be biassed by personal feelings or beguiled by fair\r\nappearances, in the face of stubborn, unaccountable facts. He preferred to\r\ntake the facts and draw his own inference--an inference which apparently\r\nseemed to him no improbable one.\r\n\r\nFor a long time nothing decisive was said or done, but while the fate of\r\nher early friendship hung in the balances, Mary's anxiety for some\r\nsettlement about Alba became almost intolerable to her, weighing on her\r\nspirits, and helping, with other depressing causes, to retard her\r\nrestoration to health.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of September she summed up in her journal the heads of the\r\nseventeen days after Clara's birth during which she had written nothing.\r\n\r\n    I am confined Tuesday, 2d. Read _Rhoda_, Pastor's _Fireside_,\r\n    _Missionary_, _Wild Irish Girl_, _The Anaconda_, _Glenarvon_, first\r\n    volume of Percy's _Northern Antiquities_. Bargain with Lackington\r\n    concerning _Frankenstein_.\r\n\r\n    Letter from Albe (Byron). An unamiable letter from Godwin about Mrs.\r\n    Godwin's visits. Mr. Baxter returns to town. Thursday, 4th, Shelley\r\n    writes his poem; his health declines. Friday, 19th, Hunts arrive.\r\n\r\nAs the autumn advanced it became evident that the sunless house at Marlow\r\nwas exceedingly cold, and far too dreary a winter residence to be\r\ndesirable for one of Shelley's feeble constitution, or even for Mary and\r\nher infant children. Shelley's health grew worse and worse. His poem was\r\nfinished and dedicated to Mary in the beautiful lines beginning--\r\n\r\n  So now my summer-task is ended, Mary,\r\n  And I return to thee, mine own heart's home;\r\n  As to his Queen some victor Knight of Faery,\r\n  Earning bright spoils for her enchanted dome;\r\n  Nor thou disdain, that ere my fame become\r\n  A star among the stars of mortal night,\r\n  If it indeed may cleave its natal gloom,\r\n  Its doubtful promise thus I would unite\r\n  With thy beloved name, thou Child of love and light.\r\n\r\nBut the reaction from the \"agony and bloody sweat of intellectual\r\ntravail,\" the troubles and griefs of the past year, and the ceaseless\r\nworry about money, all told injuriously on his physical state. He had to\r\nbe constantly away from his home, up in town, on business; and his\r\nthoughts turned longingly again towards Italy. Byron had signified his\r\nconsent to receive and provide for his daughter, subject to certain\r\nstringent conditions, chief among which was the child's complete\r\nseparation from its mother, from the time it passed into his keeping. In\r\nwriting to him on 24th September, Shelley adverts to his own wish to\r\nwinter at Pisa, and the possibility in this case of his being himself\r\nAlba's escort to Italy.\r\n\r\n    \"Now, dearest, let me talk to you,\" he writes to Mary. \"I think we\r\n    ought to go to Italy. I think my health might receive a renovation\r\n    there, for want of which perhaps I should never entirely overcome that\r\n    state of diseased action which is so painful to my beloved. I think\r\n    Alba ought to be with her father. This is a thing of incredible\r\n    importance to the happiness, perhaps, of many human beings. It might\r\n    be managed without our going there. Yes; but not without an expense\r\n    which would, in fact, suffice to settle us comfortably in a spot where\r\n    I might be regaining that health which you consider so valuable. It is\r\n    valuable to you, my own dearest. I see too plainly that you will never\r\n    be quite happy till I am well. Of myself I do not speak, for I feel\r\n    only for you.\"\r\n\r\nHe goes on to discuss the practicability of the plan from the financial\r\npoint of view, calculating what sum they may hope to get by the sale of\r\ntheir lease and furniture, and how much he may be able to borrow, either\r\nfrom his kind friend Horace Smith, or from money-lenders on _post obits_,\r\na ruinous process to which he was, all his life, forced to resort.\r\n\r\nPoor Mary in the chilly house at Marlow, with her three-weeks-old baby,\r\nher strength far from re-established, and her house full of guests, who\r\nmade themselves quite at home, was not likely to take the most sanguine\r\nview of affairs.\r\n\r\n    _25th September 1817._\r\n\r\n    You tell me, dearest, to write you long letters, but I do not know\r\n    whether I can to-day, as I am rather tired. My spirits, however, are\r\n    much better than they were, and perhaps your absence is the cause. Ah!\r\n    my love! you cannot guess how wretched it was to see your languor and\r\n    increasing illness. I now say to myself, perhaps he is better; but\r\n    then I watched you every moment, and every moment was full of pain\r\n    both to you and to me. Write, my love, a long account of what Lawrence\r\n    says; I shall be very anxious until I hear.\r\n\r\n    I do not see a great deal of our guests; they rise late, and walk all\r\n    the morning. This is something like a contrary fit of Hunt's, for I\r\n    meant to walk to-day, and said so; but they left me, and I hardly wish\r\n    to take my first walk by myself; however, I must to-morrow, if he\r\n    still shows the same want of _tact_. Peacock dines here every day,\r\n    _uninvited_, to drink his bottle. I have not seen him; he morally\r\n    disgusts me; and Marianne says that he is very ill-tempered.\r\n\r\n    I was much pained last night to hear from Mr. Baxter that Mr. Booth is\r\n    ill-tempered and jealous towards Isabel; and Mr. Baxter thinks she\r\n    half regrets her marriage; so she is to be another victim of that\r\n    ceremony. Mr. Baxter is not at all pleased with his son-in-law; but\r\n    we can talk of that when we meet.\r\n\r\n    ... A letter came from Godwin to-day, very short. You will see him;\r\n    tell me how he is. You are loaded with business, the event of most of\r\n    which I am anxious to learn, and none so much as whether you can do\r\n    anything for my Father.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MARLOW, _26th September 1817_.\r\n\r\n    You tell me to decide between Italy and the sea. I think, dearest,\r\n    if--what you do not seem to doubt, but which I do, a little--our\r\n    finances are in sufficiently good a state to bear the expense of the\r\n    journey, our inclination ought to decide. I feel some reluctance at\r\n    quitting our present settled state, but as we _must_ leave Marlow, I\r\n    do not know that stopping short on this side the Channel would be\r\n    pleasanter to me than crossing it. At any rate, my love, do not let us\r\n    encumber ourselves with a lease again.... By the bye, talking of\r\n    authorship, do get a sketch of Godwin's plan from him. I do not think\r\n    that I ought to get out of the habit of writing, and I think that the\r\n    thing he talked of would just suit me. I am glad to hear that Godwin\r\n    is well.... As to Mrs. Godwin, something very analogous to disgust\r\n    arises whenever I mention her. That last accusation of Godwin's[28]\r\n    adds bitterness to every feeling I ever felt against her.... Mr.\r\n    Baxter thinks that Mr. Booth keeps Isabel from writing to me. He has\r\n    written to her to-day warmly in praise of us both, and telling her by\r\n    all means not to let the acquaintance cool, and that in such a case\r\n    her loss would be much greater than mine. He has taken a prodigious\r\n    fancy to us, and is continually talking of and praising \"Queen Mab,\"\r\n    which he vows is the best poem of modern days.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MARLOW, _28th September 1817_.\r\n\r\n    DEAREST LOVE--Clare arrived yesterday night, and whether it might be\r\n    that she was in a croaking humour (in ill spirits she certainly was),\r\n    or whether she represented things as they really were, I know not,\r\n    but certainly affairs did not seem to wear a very good face. She talks\r\n    of Harriet's debts to a large amount, and something about Longdill's\r\n    having undertaken for them, so that they must be paid. She mentioned\r\n    also that you were entering into a _post obit_ transaction. Now this\r\n    requires our serious consideration on one account. These things (_post\r\n    obits_), as you well know, are affairs of wonderful length; and if you\r\n    must complete one before you settle on going to Italy, Alba's\r\n    departure ought certainly not to be delayed.... You have not mentioned\r\n    yet to Godwin your thoughts of Italy; but if you determine soon, I\r\n    would have you do it, as these things are always better to be talked\r\n    of some days before they take place. I took my first walk to-day. What\r\n    a dreadfully cold place this house is! I was shivering over a fire,\r\n    and the garden looked cold and dismal; but as soon as I got into the\r\n    road, I found, to my infinite surprise, that the sun was shining, and\r\n    the air warm and delightful.... I will now tell you something that\r\n    will make you laugh, if you are not too teased and ill to laugh at\r\n    anything. Ah! dearest, is it so? You know now how melancholy it makes\r\n    me sometimes to think how ill and comfortless you may be, and I so far\r\n    away from you. But to my story. In Elise's last letter to her _chere\r\n    amie_, Clare put in that Madame Clairmont was very ill, so that her\r\n    life was in danger, and added, in Elise's person, that she (Elise) was\r\n    somewhat shocked to perceive that Mademoiselle Clairmont's gaiety was\r\n    not abated by the _douloureuse_ situation of her amiable sister. Jenny\r\n    replies--\r\n\r\n    \"Mon amie, avec quel chagrin j'apprends la maladie de cette jolie et\r\n    aimable Madame Clairmont; pauvre chere dame, comme je la plains. Sans\r\n    doute elle aime tendrement son mari, et en etre separee pour\r\n    toujours--en avoir la certitude elle sentir--quelle cruelle chose;\r\n    qu'il doit etre un mechant homme pour quitter sa femme. Je ne sais ce\r\n    qu'il y a, mais cette jeune et jolie femme me tient singulierement au\r\n    coeur; je l'avoue que je n'aime point mademoiselle sa soeur.\r\n    Comment! avoir a craindre pour les jours d'une si charmante soeur,\r\n    et n'en pas perdre un grain de gaite; elle me met en colere.\"\r\n\r\n    Here is a noble resentment thrown away! Really I think this\r\n    _mystification_ of Clare's a little wicked, although laughable. I am\r\n    just now surrounded by babes. Alba is scratching and crowing, William\r\n    is amusing himself with wrapping a shawl round him, and Miss Clara\r\n    staring at the fire.... Adieu, dearest love. I want to say again, that\r\n    you may fully answer me, how very, _very_ anxious I am to know the\r\n    whole extent of your present difficulties and pursuits; and remember\r\n    also that if this _post obit_ is to be a long business, Alba must go\r\n    before it is finished. Willy is just going to bed. When I ask him\r\n    where you are, he makes me a long speech that I do not understand. But\r\n    I know my own one, that you are away, and I wish that you were with\r\n    me. Come soon, my own only love.--Your affectionate girl,\r\n\r\n      M. W. S.\r\n\r\n    _P.S._--What of _Frankenstein_? and your own poem--have you fixed on a\r\n    name? Give my love to Godwin when Mrs. Godwin is not by, or you must\r\n    give it her, and I do not love her.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _5th October 1817._\r\n\r\n    ... How happy I shall be, my own dear love, to see you again. Your\r\n    last was so very, very short a visit; and after you were gone I\r\n    thought of so many things I had to say to you, and had no time to say.\r\n    Come Tuesday, dearest, and let us enjoy some of each other's company;\r\n    come and see your sweet babes and the little Commodore;[29] she is\r\n    lively and an uncommonly interesting child. I never see her without\r\n    thinking of the expressions in my mother's letters concerning Fanny.\r\n    If a mother's eyes were not partial, she seemed like this Alba. She\r\n    mentions her intelligent eyes and great vivacity; but this is a\r\n    melancholy subject.\r\n\r\nBut Shelley's enforced absences became more and more frequent; brief\r\nvisits to his home were all that he could snatch. As the desire to escape\r\ngrew stronger, the fair prospect only seemed to recede. New complications\r\nappeared in the shape of Harriet's creditors, who pressed hard on Shelley\r\nfor a settlement of their hitherto unknown and unsuspected claims. So\r\nperilous with regard to them was his position that Mary herself was fain\r\nto caution him to stay away and out of sight for fear of arrest. It was\r\nalmost more than she could do to keep up the mask of cheerfulness, yet her\r\nletters of counsel and encouragement were her husband's mainstay.\r\n\r\n    \"Dearest and best of living beings,\" he wrote in October, \"how much do\r\n    your letters console me when I am away from you. Your letter to-day\r\n    gave me the greatest delight; so soothing, so powerful and quiet are\r\n    your expressions, that it is almost like folding you to my heart....\r\n    My own Mary, would it not be better for you to come to London at once?\r\n    I think we could quite as easily do something with the house if you\r\n    were in London--that is to say, all of you--as in the country.\"\r\n\r\nThe next two letters were written in much depression. She could not get up\r\nher strength; she dared not indulge in the hope of going abroad, for she\r\nrealised, as Shelley could not do, how little money they would have and\r\nhow much they already owed. Their income, and more, went in supporting and\r\npaying for other people, and left them nothing to live on! Clare was\r\nunsettled, unhappy, and petulant. Godwin, ignorant like the rest of the\r\nworld of her story and her present situation, unaware of Shelley's\r\nproposed move, and certain to oppose it with the energy of despair when he\r\nheard of it, was an impending visitor.\r\n\r\n    _16th October 1817._\r\n\r\n    So you do not come to-night love, nor any night; you are always away,\r\n    and this absence is long and becomes each day more dreary. Poor\r\n    Curran! so he is dead, and a sod on his breast, as four years ago I\r\n    heard him prophesy would be the case within that year.\r\n\r\n    Nothing is done, you say in your letter, and indeed I do not expect\r\n    anything will be done these many months. This, if you continued well,\r\n    would not give me so much pain, except on Alba's account. If she were\r\n    with her father, I could wait patiently, but the thought of what may\r\n    come \"between the cup and the lip\"--between now and her arrival at\r\n    Venice--is a heavy burthen on my soul. He may change his mind, or go\r\n    to Greece, or to the devil; and then what happens?\r\n\r\n    My dearest Shelley, be not, I entreat you, too self-negligent; yet\r\n    what can you do? If you were here, you might retort that question upon\r\n    me; but when I write to you I indulge false hopes of some miraculous\r\n    answer springing up in the interval. Does not Longdill[30] treat you\r\n    ill? he makes out long bills and does nothing. You say nothing of the\r\n    late arrest, and what may be the consequences, and may they not detain\r\n    you? and may you not be detained many months? for Godwin must not be\r\n    left unprovided. All these things make me run over the months, and\r\n    know not where to put my finger and say--during this year your Italian\r\n    journey shall commence. Yet when I say that it is on Alba's account\r\n    that I am anxious, this is only when you are away, and with too much\r\n    faith I believe you to be well. When I see you, drooping and languid,\r\n    in pain, and unable to enjoy life, then on your account I ardently\r\n    wish for bright skies and Italian sun.\r\n\r\n    You will have received, I hope, the manuscript that I sent yesterday\r\n    in a parcel to Hookham. I am glad to hear that the printing goes on\r\n    well; bring down all that you can with you.\r\n\r\n    If we were free and had no anxiety, what delight would Godwin's visit\r\n    give me; as it is, I fear that it will make me dreadfully miserable.\r\n    Cannot you come with him? By the way you write I hardly expect you\r\n    this week, but is it really so?\r\n\r\n    I think Alba's remaining here exceedingly dangerous, yet I do not see\r\n    what is to be done. Your babes are well. Clara already replies to her\r\n    nurse's caresses by smiles, and Willy kisses her with great\r\n    tenderness.--Your affectionate\r\n\r\n      MARY.\r\n\r\n    _P.S._--I wish you would purchase a gown for Milly,[31] with a little\r\n    note with it from Marianne,[32] that it may appear to come from her.\r\n    You can get one, I should think, for 12s. or 14s.; but it must be\r\n    _stout_; such a kind of one as we gave to the servant at Bath.\r\n\r\n    Willy has just said good-night to me; he kisses the paper and says\r\n    good-night to you. Clara is asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MARLOW, _Saturday, 18th October 1817_.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Wright has called here to-day, my dearest Shelley, and wished to\r\n    see you. I can hardly have any doubt that his business is of the same\r\n    nature as that which made him call last week. You will judge, but it\r\n    appears to me that an arrest on Monday will follow your arrival on\r\n    Sunday.\r\n\r\n    My love, you ought not to come down. A long, long week has passed, and\r\n    when at length I am allowed to expect you, I am obliged to tell you\r\n    not to come. This is very cruel. You may easily judge that I am not\r\n    happy; my spirits sink during this continued absence. Godwin, too,\r\n    will come down; he will talk as if we meant to stay here; and I\r\n    must--must I?--tell fifty prevarications or direct _lies_. When I\r\n    thought that you would be here also, I knew that your presence would\r\n    lead to general conversation; but Clare will absent herself. We shall\r\n    be alone, and he will talk of your private affairs. I am sure that I\r\n    shall never be able to support it.\r\n\r\n    And when is this to end? Italy appears to me farther off than ever,\r\n    and the idea of it never enters my mind but Godwin enters also, and\r\n    makes it lie heavy at my heart. Had you not better speak? you might\r\n    relieve me from a heavy burden. Surely he cannot be blind to the many\r\n    heavy reasons that urge us. Your health, the indispensable one, if\r\n    every other were away. I assure you that if my Father said, \"Yes, you\r\n    must go; do what you can for me; I know that you will do all you can;\"\r\n    I should, far from writing so melancholy a letter, prepare everything\r\n    with a light heart; arrange our affairs here; and come up to town, to\r\n    await patiently the effect of your efforts. I know not whether it is\r\n    early habit or affection, but the idea of his silent quiet\r\n    disapprobation makes me weep as it did in the days of my childhood.\r\n\r\n    I shall not see you to-morrow. God knows when I shall see you! Clare\r\n    is for ever wearying with her idle and childish complaints. Can you\r\n    not send me some consolation?--Ever your affectionate\r\n\r\n      MARY.\r\n\r\nThe fears of an arrest were not realised. Early in November Shelley came\r\nfor three days to Marlow, after which Mary went up to stay with him in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nDuring this fortnight's visit the question of renewed intercourse with\r\nIsabel Booth was practically decided, and decided against Mary. She had\r\nwritten on the 4th of November to Mr. Baxter inviting Christy to come on a\r\nvisit. Subsequently a plan was started for Isabel Booth's accompanying\r\nthe Shelleys in their Italian trip,--they little dreaming that when they\r\nleft England it would be for the last time.\r\n\r\nApparently Mr. Baxter made some effort to bring Mr. Booth round to his way\r\nof thinking. The two passed an evening with the Shelleys at their\r\nlodgings. But it availed nothing, and in the end poor Mr. Baxter was\r\ndriven himself to write to Shelley, breaking off the acquaintance. The\r\nletter was written much against the grain, and contrary to the convictions\r\nof the writer, who seems to have been much put to it to account for his\r\naction, the true grounds for which he could not bring himself to give.\r\nShelley, however, was not slow to divine the real instigator in the\r\naffair, and wrote back a letter which, by its temperance, simplicity, and\r\ndignity, must have pricked Baxter to the heart. Mary added a playful\r\npostscript, showing that she still clung to hope--\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR--You see I prophesied well three months ago, when you were\r\n    here. I then said that I was sure Mr. Booth was averse to our\r\n    intercourse, and would find some means to break it off. I wish I had\r\n    you by the fire here in my little study, and it might be \"double,\r\n    double, toil and trouble,\" but I could quickly convince you that your\r\n    girls are not below me in station, and that, in fact, I am the fittest\r\n    companion for them in the world, but I postpone the argument until I\r\n    see you, for I know (pardon me) that _viva voce_ is all in all with\r\n    you.\r\n\r\nTwo or three times more Mary wrote to Isabel, but the correspondence\r\ndropped and the friends met no more for many years.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for their migration extended over two or three months\r\nmore. During January Shelley suffered much from the renewal of an attack\r\nof ophthalmia, originally caught while visiting the poor people at Marlow.\r\nThe house there was finally sold, and on the 10th of February they quitted\r\nit and went up to London. Their final departure from England did not take\r\nplace until March. They made the most of their time of waiting, seeing as\r\nmuch of their friends and of objects of interest as circumstances allowed.\r\n\r\n    _Journal, Thursday, February 12_ (Mary).--Go to the Indian Library and\r\n    the Panorama of Rome.

We arrive at Calais for the third time.\r\n\r\nMary little thought how long it would be before she saw the English shores\r\nagain, nor that, when she returned, it would be alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nMARCH 1818-JUNE 1819\r\n\r\n\r\nThe external events of the four Italian years have been repeatedly told\r\nand profusely commented on by Shelley's various biographers. Summed up,\r\nthey are the history of a long strife between the intellectual and\r\ncreative stimulus of lovely scenes and immortal works of art on the one\r\nhand, and the wearing friction of vexatious outward events and crushing\r\nafflictions on the other. For Shelley they were a period of rapid, of\r\nexotic, mental growth and development, interspersed with intervals of\r\nexhaustion and depression, of restlessness, or unnatural calm. For Mary\r\nthey were years of courageous effort, of heroic resistance to overpowering\r\nodds. She endured, and she overcame; but some victories are obtained at\r\nsuch cost as to be at the time scarcely distinguishable from defeats, and\r\nthe story of hers survives in no one act or work of her own, but in the\r\n_Cenci_, _Prometheus Unbound_, _Epipsychidion_, and _Adonais_.\r\n\r\nThe travellers proceeded, _via_ Lyons and Chambery, to Milan, whence\r\nShelley and Mary made an expedition to Como in search of a house. After\r\nlooking at several,--one \"beautifully situated, but too small,\" another\r\n\"out of repair, with an excellent garden, but full of serpents,\" a third\r\nwhich seemed promising, but which they failed to get,--they appear to have\r\ngiven up the scheme altogether, and to have returned to Milan. For the\r\nnext week they were in frequent correspondence with Byron on the subject\r\nof Allegra. This had to be carried on entirely by Shelley, as Byron\r\nrefused all communication with Clare, and undertook to provide for his\r\nchild on the sole condition that, from the day it left her, its mother\r\nentirely relinquished it, and never saw it again.\r\n\r\nThis appeared to Shelley cruelly and needlessly harsh. His own paternal\r\nheart was still bleeding from fresh wounds, and although, as he again\r\npointed out, his interest in the matter was entirely on the opposite side\r\nto Clare's, he pleaded her cause with earnestness. He did not touch on the\r\nquestion of Byron's attitude towards Clare herself, he contended only for\r\nthe mother and child, in letters as remarkable for their simple good sense\r\nas for their perfect delicacy and courtesy of expression, and every line\r\nof which is inspired with the unselfish ardour of a heart full of love.\r\n\r\nPoor Clare herself was dreadfully unhappy. Any illusion she may ever have\r\nhad about Byron had long been over, but she had possibly not realised\r\nbefore coming to Italy the perfect horror he had of seeing her; an event,\r\nas he told his friends the Hoppners, which would make it necessary for him\r\ninstantly to quit Venice. The reports about his present mode of life,\r\nwhich, even at Milan did not fail to reach them, were, to say the least,\r\nnot encouraging; and from a later letter of Shelley's it would seem that\r\nhe warned Clare now, at the last minute, to pause and reflect before she\r\nsent Allegra away to such a father. She, however, was determined that till\r\nseven years old, at least, the child should be with one or other of its\r\nparents, and Byron would only consent to be that one on condition that it\r\ngrew up in ignorance of its mother. It appears to have been assumed by all\r\nparties that, in refusing to hand Allegra altogether over to her father,\r\nthey would be sacrificing for her the prospect of a brilliant position and\r\nfortune. Even supposing that this had been so, it is impossible to think\r\nthat such a consideration would have weighed, at any rate with the\r\nShelleys, but for the impossibility of keeping Clare's secret if Allegra\r\nremained with them, and the constant danger of worse scandal to which her\r\nunexplained presence must expose them. Clare, distracted with grief as she\r\nwas, yet dreaded discovery acutely, and firmly believed she was acting for\r\nAllegra's best interests in parting from her.\r\n\r\nIt ended in the little girl's being sent to Venice on the 28th of April in\r\nthe care of Elise, the Swiss nurse, with whom Mary Shelley, for Allegra's\r\nsake, consented to part, though she valued her very much, but who, not\r\nlong afterwards, returned to her.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had gone, the Shelleys and Clare left Milan; and\r\ntravelling leisurely through Parma, Modena, Bologna, and Pisa (where a\r\nletter from Elise reached them), they arrived on the 9th of May at\r\nLeghorn. Here they made the acquaintance of Mr. and Mrs. Gisborne. The\r\nlady, formerly Mrs. Reveley, had been an intimate friend of Mary\r\nWollstonecraft's (when Mary Godwin), and had been so warmly admired by\r\nGodwin before his first marriage as to arouse some jealousy in Mr.\r\nReveley. Indeed, his admiration had been returned by so warm a feeling of\r\nfriendship on her part that Godwin was frankly surprised when on his\r\npressing her, shortly after her widowhood, to become his second wife, she\r\nrefused him point blank, nor, by all his eloquence, was to be persuaded to\r\nchange her mind. A beautiful girl, and highly accomplished, she had\r\nmarried very young, and had one son of her first marriage, Henry Reveley,\r\na young civil engineer, who was now living in Italy with her and her\r\nsecond husband.\r\n\r\nThis Mr. Gisborne struck Mary as being the reverse of intelligent, and is\r\ndescribed in Shelley's letters in most uncomplimentary terms. His\r\nappearance cannot certainly have been in his favour, but that there must\r\nhave been more in him than met the eye seems also beyond a doubt, as, at a\r\nlater time, Shelley addressed to him some of his most interesting and most\r\nintimate letters.\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Gisborne they bore a letter of introduction from Godwin, and it\r\nwas not long before her acquaintance with Mrs. Shelley ripened into\r\nfriendship. \"Reserved, yet with easy manners;\" so Mary described her at\r\ntheir first meeting. On the next day the two had a long conversation about\r\nMary's father and mother. Of her mother, indeed, Mary learned more from\r\nMrs. Gisborne than from any one else. She wrote her father an immediate\r\naccount of these first interviews, and his answer is unusually\r\ndemonstrative in expression.\r\n\r\n    I received last Friday a delightful letter from you. I was extremely\r\n    gratified by your account of Mrs. Gisborne. I have not seen her, I\r\n    believe, these twenty years; I think not since she was Mrs. Gisborne;\r\n    and yet by your description she is still a delightful woman. How\r\n    inexpressibly pleasing it is to call back the recollection of years\r\n    long past, and especially when the recollection belongs to a person in\r\n    whom one deeply interested oneself, as I did in Mrs. Reveley. I can\r\n    hardly hope for so great a pleasure as it would be to me to see her\r\n    again.\r\n\r\nAt the Bagni di Lucca, where they settled themselves for a time, Mary\r\nheard from her father of the review of _Frankenstein_ in the _Quarterly_.\r\nPeacock had reported it to be unfavourable, so it was probably a relief\r\nto find that the reviewers \"did not pretend to find anything blasphemous\r\nin the story.\"\r\n\r\n    They say that the _gentleman_ who has written the book is a _man of\r\n    talents_, but that he employs his powers in a way disagreeable to\r\n    them.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, tended to keep Mary's old ardour alive. She never was\r\nmore strongly impelled to write than at this time; she felt her powers\r\nfresh and strong within her; all she wanted was some motive, some\r\nsuggestion to guide her in the choice of a subject. While at Leghorn\r\nShelley had come upon a manuscript account, which Mary transcribed, of\r\nthat terrible story of the _Cenci_ afterwards dramatised by himself. His\r\nfirst idea was that Mary should take it for the subject of a play. He was\r\nconvinced that she had dramatic talent as a writer, and that he had none;\r\ntwo erroneous conclusions, as the sequel showed. But such an assurance\r\nfrom such a source could not but be flattering to Mary's ambition, and\r\nstimulating to her innate love of literary work. During all the early part\r\nof their time in Italy their thoughts were busy with some subject for\r\nMary's tragedy. One proposed and strongly urged by Shelley was _Charles\r\nthe First_. It was partially carried out by himself before his death, and\r\nperhaps occurred to him now in connection with a suggestion of Godwin's\r\nfor a book very different in scope and character, and far better suited to\r\nMary's genius than the drama. It would have been a series of _Lives of the\r\nCommonwealth's Men_; \"our calumniated Republicans,\" as Shelley calls them.\r\n\r\nShe was immensely attracted by the idea, but was forced to abandon it at\r\nthe time, for lack of the necessary books of reference. But Shelley, who\r\nbelieved her powers to be of the highest order, was as eager as she\r\nherself could be for her to undertake original work of some kind, and was\r\nconstantly inciting her to effort in this direction.\r\n\r\nMore than two months were spent at the Bagni di Lucca--reading, writing,\r\nriding, and enjoying to the full the balmy Italian skies. Shelley, in whom\r\nthe creative mood was more or less dormant, and who \"despaired of\r\nproviding anything original,\" translated the _Symposium_ of Plato, partly\r\nas an exercise, partly to \"give Mary some idea of the manners and feelings\r\nof the Athenians, so different on many subjects from that of any other\r\ncommunity that ever existed.\" Together they studied Italian, and Shelley\r\nreported Mary's progress to her father.\r\n\r\n    Mary has just finished Ariosto with me, and indeed has attained a very\r\n    competent knowledge of Italian. She is now reading Livy.\r\n\r\nShe also transcribed his translation of the _Symposium_, and his Eclogue\r\n_Rosalind and Helen_, which, begun at Marlow, had been thrown aside till\r\nshe found it and persuaded him to complete it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Clare hungered and thirsted for a sight of Allegra, of whom she\r\nheard occasionally from Elise, and who was not now under Byron's roof, but\r\nliving, by his permission, with Mrs. Hoppner, wife of the British Consul\r\nat Venice, who had volunteered to take temporary charge of her. Her\r\ndistress moved Shelley to so much commiseration that he resolved or\r\nconsented to do what must have been supremely disagreeable to him. He went\r\nhimself to Venice, hoping by a personal interview to modify in some degree\r\nByron's inexorable resolution. Clare accompanied him, unknown, of course,\r\nto Byron. They started on the 17th of August. On that day Mary wrote the\r\nfollowing letter to Miss Gisborne--\r\n\r\n    MRS. SHELLEY TO MRS. GISBORNE.\r\n\r\n    BAGNI DI LUCCA, _17th August 1818_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MADAM--It gave me great pleasure to receive your letter after\r\n    so long a silence, when I had begun to conjecture a thousand reasons\r\n    for it, and among others illness, in which I was half right. Indeed, I\r\n    am much concerned to hear of Mr. R.'s attacks, and sincerely hope that\r\n    nothing will retard his speedy recovery. His illness gives me a slight\r\n    hope that you might now be induced to come to the baths, if it were\r\n    even to try the effect of the hot baths. You would find the weather\r\n    cool; for we already feel in this part of the world that the year is\r\n    declining, by the cold mornings and evenings. I have another selfish\r\n    reason to wish that you would come, which I have a great mind not to\r\n    mention, yet I will not omit it, as it might induce you. Shelley and\r\n    Clare are gone; they went to-day to Venice on important business; and\r\n    I am left to take care of the house. Now, if all of you, or any of\r\n    you, would come and cheer my solitude, it would be exceedingly kind. I\r\n    daresay you would find many of your friends here; among the rest there\r\n    is the Signora Felichi, whom I believe you knew at Pisa. Shelley and I\r\n    have ridden almost every evening. Clare did the same at first, but she\r\n    has been unlucky, and once fell from her horse, and hurt her knee so\r\n    as to knock her up for some time. It is the fashion here for all the\r\n    English to ride, and it is very pleasant on these fine evenings, when\r\n    we set out at sunset and are lighted home by Venus, Jupiter, and\r\n    Diana, who kindly lend us their light after the sleepy Apollo is gone\r\n    to bed. The road which we frequent is raised somewhat above, and\r\n    overlooks the river, affording some very fine points of view amongst\r\n    these woody mountains.\r\n\r\n    Still, we know no one; we speak to one or two people at the Casino,\r\n    and that is all; we live in our studious way, going on with Tasso,\r\n    whom I like, but who, now I have read more than half his poem, I do\r\n    not know that I like half so well as Ariosto. Shelley translated the\r\n    _Symposium_ in ten days. It is a most beautiful piece of writing. I\r\n    think you will be delighted with it. It is true that in many\r\n    particulars it shocks our present manners; but no one can be a reader\r\n    of the works of antiquity unless they can transport themselves from\r\n    these to other times, and judge, not by our, but their morality.\r\n\r\n    Shelley is tolerably well in health; the hot weather has done him\r\n    good. We have been in high debate--nor have we come to any\r\n    conclusion--concerning the land or sea journey to Naples. We have been\r\n    thinking that when we want to go, although the equinox will be past,\r\n    yet the equinoctial winds will hardly have spent themselves; and I\r\n    cannot express to you how I fear a storm at sea with two such young\r\n    children as William and Clara. Do you know the periods when the\r\n    Mediterranean is troubled, and when the wintry halcyon days come?\r\n    However, it may be we shall see you before we proceed southward.\r\n\r\n    We have been reading Eustace's _Tour through Italy_; I do not wonder\r\n    the Italians reprinted it. Among other select specimens of his way of\r\n    thinking, he says that the Romans did not derive their arts and\r\n    learning from the Greeks; that Italian ladies are chaste, and the\r\n    lazzaroni honest and industrious; and that, as to assassination and\r\n    highway robbery in Italy, it is all a calumny--no such things were\r\n    ever heard of. Italy was the garden of Eden, and all the Italians\r\n    Adams and Eves, until the blasts of hell (_i.e._ the French--for by\r\n    that polite name he designates them) came. By the bye, an Italian\r\n    servant stabbed an English one here--it was thought dangerously at\r\n    first, but the man is doing better.\r\n\r\n    I have scribbled a long letter, and I daresay you have long wished to\r\n    be at the end of it. Well, now you are; so my dear Mrs. Gisborne, with\r\n    best remembrances, yours, obliged and affectionately,\r\n\r\n      MARY W. SHELLEY.\r\n\r\nFrom Florence, where he arrived on the 20th, Shelley wrote to Mary,\r\ntelling her that Clare had changed her intention of going in person to\r\nVenice, and had decided on the more politic course of remaining herself at\r\nFusina or Padua, while Shelley went on to see Byron.\r\n\r\n    \"Well, my dearest Mary,\" he went on, \"are you very lonely? Tell me\r\n    truth, my sweetest, do you ever cry? I shall hear from you once at\r\n    Venice and once on my return here. If you love me, you will keep up\r\n    your spirits; and at all events tell me truth about it, for I assure\r\n    you I am not of a disposition to be flattered by your sorrow, though I\r\n    should be by your cheerfulness, and above all by seeing such fruits of\r\n    my absence as was produced when I was at Geneva.\"\r\n\r\nIt was during Shelley's absence with Byron on their voyage round the lake\r\nof Geneva that Mary had begun to write _Frankenstein_. But on the day when\r\nshe received this letter she was very uneasy about her little girl, who\r\nwas seriously unwell from the heat. On writing to Shelley she told him of\r\nthis; and, from his answer, one may infer that she had suggested the\r\nadvisability of taking the child to Venice for medical advice.\r\n\r\n    PADUA, MEZZOGIORNO.\r\n\r\n    MY BEST MARY--I found at Mount Selica a favourable opportunity for\r\n    going to Venice, when I shall try to make some arrangement for you and\r\n    little Ca to come for some days, and shall meet you, if I do not write\r\n    anything in the meantime, at Padua on Thursday morning. Clare says she\r\n    is obliged to come to see the Medico, whom we missed this morning, and\r\n    who has appointed as the only hour at which he can be at leisure, 8\r\n    o'clock in the morning. You must, therefore, arrange matters so that\r\n    you should come to the Stella d'Oro a little before that hour, a thing\r\n    only to be accomplished by setting out at half-past 3 in the morning.\r\n    You will by this means arrive at Venice very early in the day, and\r\n    avoid the heat, which might be bad for the babe, and take the time\r\n    when she would at least sleep great part of the time. Clare will\r\n    return with the return carriage, and I shall meet you, or send to you,\r\n    at Padua. Meanwhile, remember _Charles the First_, and do you be\r\n    prepared to bring at least some of _Mirra_ translated; bring the book\r\n    also with you, and the sheets of _Prometheus Unbound_, which you will\r\n    find numbered from 1 to 26 on the table of the Pavilion. My poor\r\n    little Clara; how is she to-day? Indeed, I am somewhat uneasy about\r\n    her; and though I feel secure there is no danger, it would be very\r\n    comfortable to have some reasonable person's opinion about her. The\r\n    Medico at Padua is certainly a man in great practice; but I confess he\r\n    does not satisfy me. Am I not like a wild swan, to be gone so\r\n    suddenly? But, in fact, to set off alone to Venice required an\r\n    exertion. I felt myself capable of making it, and I knew that you\r\n    desired it.... Adieu, my dearest love. Remember, remember _Charles the\r\n    First_ and _Mirra_. I have been already imagining how you will conduct\r\n    some scenes. The second volume of _St. Leon_ begins with this proud\r\n    and true sentiment--\r\n\r\n    \"There is nothing which the human mind can conceive which it may not\r\n    execute.\" Shakespeare was only a human being. Adieu till\r\n    Thursday.--Your ever affectionate,\r\n\r\n      P. B. S.\r\n\r\nHis next letter, however, announced yet another revolution in Clare's\r\nplans. Her heart failed her at the idea of remaining to endure her\r\nsuspense all alone in a strange place; and so, braving the possible\r\nconsequences of Byron's discovering her move before he was informed of it,\r\nshe went on with Shelley to Venice, and, the morning after their arrival,\r\nproceeded to Mr. Hoppner's house. Here she was kindly welcomed by him and\r\nhis wife, a pretty Swiss woman, with a sympathetic motherly heart, who\r\nknew all about her and Allegra. They insisted, too, on Shelley's staying\r\nwith them, and he was nothing loth to accept the offer, for Byron's circle\r\nwould not have suited him at all.\r\n\r\nHe was pleased with his hostess, something in whose appearance reminded\r\nhim of Mary. \"She has hazel eyes and sweet looks, rather Maryish,\" he\r\nwrote. And in another letter he described her as\r\n\r\n    So good, so beautiful, so angelically mild that, were she wise too,\r\n    she would be quite a Mary. But she is not very accomplished. Her eyes\r\n    are like a reflection of yours; her manners are like yours when you\r\n    know and like a person.\r\n\r\nHe could enjoy no pleasure without longing for Mary to share it, and from\r\nthe moment he reached Venice he was planning impatiently for her to follow\r\nhim, to experience with him the strange emotions aroused by the first\r\nsight of the wonderful city, and to make acquaintance with his new\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nHe lost no time in calling on Byron, who gave him a very friendly\r\nreception. Shelley's intention on leaving Lucca was to go with his family\r\nto Florence, and the plan he urged on Byron was that Allegra should come\r\nto spend some time there with her mother. To this Byron objected, as\r\nlikely to raise comment, and as a reopening of the whole question. He was,\r\nhowever, in an affable mood, and not indisposed to meet Shelley halfway.\r\nHe had heard of Clare's being at Padua, but nothing of her subsequent\r\nchange of plan; and, assuming that the whole party were staying there, he\r\noffered to send Allegra as far as that, on a week's visit. Finding that\r\nthings were not as he supposed, and that Mrs. Shelley was likely to come\r\npresently to Venice, he proposed to lend them for some time a villa which\r\nhe rented at Este, and to let Allegra stay with them. The offer was\r\npromptly and gratefully accepted by Shelley. The fact of Clare's presence\r\nin Venice had, perforce, to be kept dark; for that there was no help; the\r\ngreat thing was to get her and Allegra away as soon as possible. He sent\r\ndirections to Mary to pack up at once and travel with the least possible\r\ndelay to Este. There he would meet her with Clare, Allegra, and Elise, who\r\nwere to be established, with Mary's little ones, at Byron's villa, Casa\r\nCappucini, while she and he proceeded to Venice.\r\n\r\nWhen the letter came, Mary had the Gisbornes staying with her on a visit.\r\nFor that reason, and on account of little Clara's indisposition, the\r\nsummons to depart so suddenly can hardly have been welcome; she obeyed it,\r\nhowever, and left the Bagni di Lucca on the 31st of August. Owing to\r\ndelays about the passport, her journey took rather longer than they had\r\nexpected. The intense heat of the weather, added to the fatigue of\r\ntravelling and probably change of diet, seriously affected the poor baby,\r\nwho, by the time they got to Este on 5th September, was dangerously ill.\r\nShelley, who had been waiting for them impatiently, was also far from\r\nwell, and their visit to Venice had to be deferred for more than a\r\nfortnight, during which Mary had time to hear enough of Venetian society\r\nto horrify and disgust her.\r\n\r\n    _Journal, Saturday, September 5._--Arrive at Este. Poor Clara is\r\n    dangerously ill. Shelley is very unwell, from taking poison in Italian\r\n    cakes. He writes his drama of _Prometheus_. Read seven cantos of\r\n    Dante. Begin to translate _A Cajo Graccho_ of Monti, and _Measure for\r\n    Measure_.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, September 16._--Read the _Filippo_ of Alfieri. Shelley and\r\n    Clare go to Padua. He is very ill from the effects of his poison.\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Gisborne she wrote as follows--\r\n\r\n    _September 1818._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MRS. GISBORNE--I hasten to write to you to say that we have\r\n    arrived safe, and yet I can hardly call it safe, since the fatigue has\r\n    given my poor _Ca_ an attack of dysentery; and although she is now\r\n    somewhat recovered from that disorder, she is still in a frightful\r\n    state of weakness and fever, and is reduced to be so thin in this\r\n    short time that you would hardly know her again.\r\n\r\n    The physician of Este is a stupid fellow; but there is one come from\r\n    Padua, and who appears clever; so I hope under his care she will soon\r\n    get well, although we are still in great anxiety concerning her. I\r\n    found Mr. Shelley very anxious for our non-arrival, for, besides other\r\n    delays, we were detained a whole day at Florence for a signature to\r\n    our passport. The house at Este is exceedingly pleasant, with a large\r\n    garden and quantities of excellent fruit. I have not yet been to\r\n    Venice, and know not when I shall, since it depends upon the state of\r\n    Clara's health. I hope Mr. Reveley is quite recovered from his\r\n    illness, and I am sure the baths did him a great deal of good. So now\r\n    I suppose all your talk is how you will get to England. Shelley agrees\r\n    with me that you could live very well for your L200 per annum in\r\n    Marlow or some such town; and I am sure you would be much happier than\r\n    in Italy. How all the English dislike it! The Hoppners speak with the\r\n    greatest acrimony of the Italians, and Mr. Hoppner says that he was\r\n    actually driven from Italian society by the young men continually\r\n    asking him for money. Everything is saleable in Venice, even the wives\r\n    of the gentry, if you pay well. It appears indeed a most frightful\r\n    system of society. Well! when shall we see you again? Soon, I daresay.\r\n    I am so much hurried that you will be kind enough to excuse the\r\n    abruptness of this letter. I will write soon again, and in the\r\n    meantime write to me. Shelley and Clare desire the kindest\r\n    remembrances.--My dear Mrs. Gisborne, affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n      MARY W. S.\r\n\r\n    Casa Capuccini, Este.\r\n    Send our letters to this direction.\r\n\r\nNo more of the journal was written till the 24th, and in the meantime\r\ngreat trouble had fallen on the writers. Shelley was impatient for Clara\r\nto be within reach of better medical advice, and anxious to get Mary to\r\nVenice. He went forward himself on the 22d, returning next day as far as\r\nPadua to meet Mary and Clara, with Clare, who, however, only came over to\r\nPadua to see the Medico. The baby was very ill, and was getting worse\r\nevery hour, but they judged it best to press on. In their hurry they had\r\nforgotten their passport, and had some difficulty in getting past the\r\n_dogana_ in consequence. Shelley's impetuosity carried all obstacles\r\nbefore it, and the soldiers on duty had to give way. On reaching Venice\r\nMary went straight with her sick child to the inn, while Shelley hurried\r\nfor the doctor. It was too late. When he got back (without the medical\r\nman) he found Mary well-nigh beside herself with distress. Another doctor\r\nhad already been summoned, but little Clara was dying, and in an hour all\r\nwas over.\r\n\r\nThis blow reduced Mary to \"a kind of despair\";--the expression is\r\nShelley's. Mr. Hoppner, on hearing what had happened, insisted on taking\r\nthem away at once from the inn to his house. Four days she spent in Venice\r\nafter that, the first of which was a blank; of the second she merely\r\nrecords--\r\n\r\n    An idle day. Go to the Lido and see Albe there.\r\n\r\nAfter that she roused herself. There was Shelley to be comforted and\r\nsupported, there was Byron to be interviewed. One of her objects in coming\r\nhad been to try and persuade him after all to let Allegra stay. So she\r\nnerved herself to pay this visit, and to go about and see something of\r\nVenice with Shelley.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, September 27._--Read fourth canto of _Childe Harold_. It\r\n    rains. Go to the Doge's Palace, Ponte dei Sospiri, etc. Go to the\r\n    Academy with Mr. and Mrs. Hoppner, and see some fine pictures. Call at\r\n    Lord Byron's and see the _Farmaretta_.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, September 28._--Go with Mrs. Hoppner and Cavaliere Mengaldo\r\n    to the Library. Shopping. In the evening Lord Byron calls.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, September 29._--Leave Venice, and arrive at Este at night.\r\n    Clare is gone with the children to Padua.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, September 30._--The chicks return. Transcribe _Mazeppa_.\r\n    Go to the opera in the evening.\r\n\r\nA quiet, sad fortnight at Este followed. An idle one it was not, for\r\nShelley not only wrote _Julian and Maddalo_, but worked on portions of\r\nhis drama of _Prometheus Unbound_, the idea of which had haunted him ever\r\nsince he came to Italy. Clare, for the time, was happy with her child.\r\nMary read several plays of Shakespeare and the lives of Alfieri and Tasso\r\nin Italian.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of October she arrived once more at Venice with Shelley. She\r\npassed the greater part of her time there with the Hoppners, who were\r\nexceedingly friendly. Shelley visited Byron several times, probably trying\r\nto get an extension of leave for Allegra. In this, however, he must have\r\nfailed, as on the 24th he went to Este to fetch her, returning with her on\r\nthe 29th. Having restored the poor little girl to the Hoppners' care, he\r\nand Mary went once more to Este, but this time only to prepare for\r\ndeparture. On the 5th of November the whole party, including Elise (who\r\nwas not retained for Allegra's service), left the Villa Capuccini and\r\ntravelled by slow stages to Rome.\r\n\r\nNo further allusion to her recent bereavement is to be found in Mary's\r\njournal. She attempted to behave like the Stoic her father had wished her\r\nto be.[33] She had written to him of her affliction, and received the\r\nfollowing answer from the philosopher--\r\n\r\n    SKINNER STREET, _27th October 1818_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MARY--I sincerely sympathise with you in the affliction which\r\n    forms the subject of your letter, and which I may consider as the\r\n    first severe trial of your constancy and the firmness of your temper\r\n    that has occurred to you in the course of your life; you should,\r\n    however, recollect that it is only persons of a very ordinary sort,\r\n    and of a pusillanimous disposition, that sink long under a calamity of\r\n    this nature. I assure you such a recollection will be of great use to\r\n    you. We seldom indulge long in depression and mourning except when we\r\n    think secretly that there is something very refined in it, and that it\r\n    does us honour.\r\n\r\nSuch a homily, at such a time, must have made Mary feel like a person of a\r\nvery ordinary sort indeed. But she strove, only too hard, to carry out her\r\nfather's principles; for, by doing violence to her sensitive nature, she\r\nmight crush but could not kill it. The passionate impulses of her mother\r\nwere curiously mated in her with her father's reflective temperament; and\r\nthe noble courage which she inherited from Mary Wollstonecraft went hand\r\nin hand with somewhat of Godwin's constitutional shrinking from any\r\nmanifestation of emotion. And the effect of determinate, excessive\r\nself-restraint on a heart like hers was to render the crushed feelings\r\nmorbid in their acuteness, and to throw on her spirits a load of endurance\r\nwhich was borne, indeed, but at ruinous cost, and operated largely, among\r\nother causes, to make her seem cold when she was really suffering.\r\n\r\nAt such times it was not altogether well for her that she was Shelley's\r\ncompanion. For, when his health and spirits were good, he craved and\r\ndemanded companionship,--personal, intellectual, playful,--companionship\r\nof all sorts; but when they ebbed, when his vitality was low, when the\r\nsimultaneous exaltation of conception and labour of realisation--a\r\ntremendous expenditure of force--was over, and left him shattered, shaken,\r\nsurprised at himself like one who in a dream falls from a height and\r\nawakens with the shock,--tired, and yet dull,--then the one panacea for\r\nhim was animal spirits in some congenial acquaintance; whether a friend or\r\na previous stranger mattered little, provided the personality was\r\ncongenial and the spirits buoyant. Mary did her best, bravely and nobly.\r\nBut the loss of a child was one thing to Shelley, another thing to her.\r\nShe strove to overcome the low spirits from which she suffered. But\r\nendurance, though more heroic than spontaneous cheerfulness, is not to be\r\ncompared with it in its benign effect on other people; nay, it may even\r\nhave a depressing effect when a yielding to emotion \"of the ordinary sort\"\r\nmay not. All these truths, however, do not become evident at once; like\r\nother life-experience they have to be spelled out by slow and painful\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nTo seek for respite from grief or care in intellectual culture and the\r\nacquisition of knowledge was instinctive and habitual both in Shelley and\r\nin Mary. They visited Ferrara and Bologna, then travelled by a winding\r\nroad among the Apennines to Terni, where they saw the celebrated\r\nwaterfall--\r\n\r\n    It put me in mind of Sappho leaping from a rock, and her form\r\n    vanishing as in the shape of a swan in the distance.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, November 20._--We travel all day the Campagna di Roma--a\r\n    perfect solitude, yet picturesque, and relieved by shady dells. We see\r\n    an immense hawk sailing in the air for prey. Enter Rome. A rainy\r\n    evening. Doganas and cheating innkeepers. We at length get settled in\r\n    a comfortable hotel.\r\n\r\nAfter one week in Rome, during which they visited as many of the wonders\r\nof the Eternal City as the time allowed, they journeyed on to Naples,\r\nreading Montaigne by the way.\r\n\r\nAt Naples they remained for three months. Of their life there Mary's\r\njournal gives no account; she confines herself almost entirely to noting\r\ndown the books they read, and one or two excursions. They lived in very\r\ngreat seclusion, greater than was good for them, but Shelley suffered much\r\nfrom ill-health, and not a little from its treatment by an unskilful\r\nphysician. They read incessantly,--Livy, Dante, Sismondi, Winkelmann, the\r\nGeorgics and Plutarch's _Lives_, _Gil Blas_, and _Corinne_. They left no\r\nbeautiful or interesting scene unvisited; they ascended Vesuvius, and\r\nmade excursions to Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Paestum.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of December Mary records--\r\n\r\n    Go on the sea with Shelley. Visit Capo Miseno, the Elysian Fields,\r\n    Avernus, Solfatara. The Bay of Baiae is beautiful, but we are\r\n    disappointed by the various places we visit.\r\n\r\nThe impression of the scene, however, remained after the temporary\r\ndisappointment had been forgotten, and she sketched it from memory many\r\nyears later in the fanciful introduction to her romance of _The Last Man_,\r\nthe story of which purports to be a tale deciphered from sibylline leaves,\r\npicked up in the caverns.\r\n\r\nShelley, however, suffered from extreme depression, which, out of\r\nsolicitous consideration for Mary, he disguised as much as possible under\r\na mask of cheerfulness, insomuch that she never fully realised what he\r\nendured at this time until she read the mournful poems written at Naples,\r\nafter he who wrote them had passed for ever out of sight.\r\n\r\nShe blamed herself then for what seemed to her her blindness,--for having\r\nperhaps let slip opportunities of cheering him which she would have sold\r\nher soul to recall when it was too late. That _he_, at the time, felt in\r\nher no such want of sympathy or help is shown by his concluding words in\r\nthe advertisement of _Rosalind and Helen_, and _Lines written among the\r\nEuganean Hills_, dated Naples, 20th December, where he says of certain\r\nlines \"which image forth the sudden relief of a state of deep despondency\r\nby the radiant visions disclosed by the sudden burst of an Italian sunrise\r\nin autumn on the highest peak of those delightful mountains,\" that, if\r\nthey were not erased, it was \"at the request of a dear friend, with whom\r\nadded years of intercourse only add to my apprehension of its value, and\r\nwho would have had more right than any one to complain that she has not\r\nbeen able to extinguish in me the very power of delineating sadness.\"\r\n\r\nMuch of this sadness was due to physical suffering, but external causes of\r\nanxiety and vexation were not wanting. One was the discovery of grave\r\nmisconduct on the part of their Italian servant, Paolo. An engagement had\r\nbeen talked of between him and the Swiss nurse Elise, but the Shelleys,\r\nwho thought highly of Elise and by no means highly of Paolo, tried to\r\ndissuade her from the idea. An illness of Elise's revealed the fact that\r\nan illicit connection had been formed. The Shelleys, greatly distressed,\r\ntook the view that it would not do to throw Elise on the world without in\r\nsome degree binding Paolo to do his duty towards her, and they had them\r\nmarried. How far this step was well-judged may be a matter of opinion.\r\nElise was already a mother when she entered the Shelleys service. Whether\r\na woman already a mother was likely to do better for being bound for life\r\nto a man whom they \"knew to be a rascal\" may reasonably be doubted even by\r\nthose who hold the marriage-tie, as such, in higher honour than the\r\nShelleys did. But whether the action was mistaken or not, it was prompted\r\nby the sincerest solicitude for Elise's welfare, a solicitude to be\r\nrepaid, at no distant date, by the basest ingratitude. Meanwhile Mary lost\r\nher nurse, and, it may be assumed, a valuable one; for any one who studies\r\nthe history of this and the preceding years must see all three of the poor\r\ndoomed children throve as long as Elise was in charge of them.\r\n\r\nClare was ailing, and anxious too; how could it be otherwise? Just before\r\nAllegra's third birthday, Mary received a letter from Mrs. Hoppner which\r\nwas anything but reassuring. It gave an unsatisfactory account of the\r\nchild, who did not thrive in the climate of Venice, and a still more\r\nunsatisfactory account of Byron.\r\n\r\n    Il faut esperer qu'elle se changera pour son mieux quand il ne sera\r\n    plus si froid; mais je crois toujours que c'est tres malheureux que\r\n    Miss Clairmont oblige cette enfant de vivre a Venise, dont le climat\r\n    est nuisible en tout au physique de la petite, et vraiment, pour ce\r\n    que fera son pere, je le trouve un peu triste d'y sacrifier l'enfant.\r\n    My Lord continue de vivre dans une debauche affreuse qui tot ou tard\r\n    le menera a sa ruine....\r\n\r\n    Quant a moi, je voudrois faire tout ce qui est en mon pouvoir pour\r\n    cette enfant, que je voudrois bien volontiers rendre aussi heureuse\r\n    que possible le temps qu'elle restera avec nous; car je crains\r\n    qu'apres elle devra toujours vivre avec des etrangers, indifferents a\r\n    son sort. My Lord bien certainement ne la rendra jamais plus a sa\r\n    mere; ainsi il n'y a rien de bon a esperer pour cette chere petite.\r\n\r\nThis letter, if she saw it, may well have made Clare curse the day when\r\nshe let Allegra go.\r\n\r\nStill, after they returned to Rome at the beginning of March, a brighter\r\ntime set in.\r\n\r\n    _Journal, Friday, March 5._--After passing over the beautiful hills of\r\n    Albano, and traversing the Campagna, we arrive at the Holy City again,\r\n    and see the Coliseum again.\r\n\r\n      All that Athens ever brought forth wise,\r\n      All that Afric ever brought forth strange,\r\n      All that which Asia ever had of prize,\r\n      Was here to see. Oh, marvellous great change!\r\n      Rome living was the world's sole ornament;\r\n      And dead, is now the world's sole monument.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, March 7._--Move to our lodgings. A rainy day. Visit the\r\n    Coliseum. Read the Bible.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, March 8._--Visit the Museum of the Vatican. Read the Bible.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, March 9._--Shelley and I go to the Villa Borghese. Drive\r\n    about Rome. Visit the Pantheon. Visit it again by moonlight, and see\r\n    the yellow rays fall through the roof upon the floor of the temple.\r\n    Visit the Coliseum.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, March 10._--Visit the Capitol, and see the most divine\r\n    statues.\r\n\r\nNot one of the party but was revived and invigorated by the beauty and\r\noverpowering interest of the surrounding scenes, and the delight of a\r\nlovely Italian spring. To Shelley it was life itself.\r\n\r\n    \"The charm of the Roman climate,\" says Mrs. Shelley, \"helped to clothe\r\n    his thoughts in greater beauty than they had ever worn before. And as\r\n    he wandered among the ruins, made one with nature in their decay, or\r\n    gazed on the Praxitelean shapes that throng the Vatican, the Capitol,\r\n    and the palaces of Rome, his soul imbibed forms of loveliness which\r\n    became a portion of itself.\"\r\n\r\nThe visionary drama of _Prometheus Unbound_, which had haunted, yet eluded\r\nhim so long, suddenly took life and shape, and stood before him, a vivid\r\nreality. During his first month at Rome he completed it in its original\r\nthree-act form. The fourth act was an afterthought, and was added at a\r\nlater date.\r\n\r\nFor a short, enchanted time--his health renewed, the deadening years\r\nforgotten, his susceptibilities sharpened, not paralysed, by recent\r\ngrief--he gave himself up to the vision of the realisation of his\r\nlife-dream; the disappearance of evil from the earth.\r\n\r\n    \"He believed,\" wrote Mary Shelley, \"that mankind had only to will that\r\n    there should be no evil, and there would be none.... That man should\r\n    be so perfectionised as to be able to expel evil from his own nature,\r\n    and from the greater part of the creation was the cardinal point of\r\n    his system. And the subject he loved best to dwell on, was the image\r\n    of one warring with the Evil Principle, oppressed not only by it, but\r\n    by all, even the good, who were deluded into considering evil a\r\n    necessary portion of humanity. A victim full of fortitude and hope,\r\n    and the spirit of triumph emanating from a reliance in the ultimate\r\n    omnipotence of good.\"\r\n\r\n    \"This poem,\" he himself says, \"was chiefly written upon the\r\n    mountainous ruins of the Baths of Caracalla, among the flowers,\r\n    glades, and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees, which are\r\n    extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and\r\n    dizzy arches suspended in the air. The bright blue sky of Rome, and\r\n    the effect of the vigorous awakening of spring in that divinest\r\n    climate, and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to\r\n    intoxication, were the inspiration of this drama.\"[34]\r\n\r\nAnd while he wrought and wove the radiant web of his poem, Mary, excited\r\nto greatest enthusiasm by the treasures of sculpture at Rome, and infected\r\nby the atmosphere of art around her, took up again her favourite pursuit\r\nof drawing, which she had discontinued since going to Marlow, and worked\r\nat it many hours a day, sometimes all day. She was writing, too; a\r\nthoroughly congenial occupation, at once soothing and stimulating to her.\r\nShe studied the Bible, with the keen fresh interest of one who comes new\r\nto it, and she read Livy and Montaigne.\r\n\r\nLittle William was thriving, and growing more interesting every day. His\r\nbeauty and promise and angelic sweetness made him the pet and darling of\r\nall who knew him, while to his parents he was a perpetual source of ever\r\nfresh and increasing delight. And his mother looked forward to the birth\r\nin autumn of another little one who might, in some measure, fill the place\r\nof her lost Clara.\r\n\r\nClare, who, also, was in better health, was not behindhand in energy or\r\nindustry. Music was her favourite pursuit; she took singing-lessons from a\r\ngood master and worked hard.\r\n\r\nThey led a somewhat less secluded life than at Naples, and at the house of\r\nSignora Dionizi, a Roman painter and authoress (described by Mary Shelley\r\nas \"very old, very miserly, and very mean\"), Mary and Clare, at any rate,\r\nsaw a little of Italian society. For this, however, Shelley did not care,\r\nnor was he attracted by any of the few English with whom he came in\r\ncontact. Yet he felt his solitude. In April, when the strain of his work\r\nwas over, his spirits drooped, as usual; and he longed then for some\r\n_congenial distraction_, some human help to bear the burden of life till\r\nthe moment of weakness should have passed. But the fount of inspiration,\r\nthe source of temporary elation and strength, had not been exhausted by\r\n_Prometheus_.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of April Mary notes--\r\n\r\n    Visit the Palazzo Corunna, and see the picture of Beatrice Cenci.\r\n\r\nThe interest in the old idea was revived in him; he became engrossed in\r\nthe subject, and soon after his \"lyrical drama\" was done, he transferred\r\nhimself to this other, completely different work. There was no talk, now,\r\nof passing it on to Mary, and indeed she may well have recoiled from the\r\nunmitigated horrors of the tale. But, though he dealt with it himself,\r\nShelley still felt on unfamiliar ground, and, as he proceeded, he\r\nsubmitted what he wrote to Mary for her judgment and criticism; the only\r\noccasion on which he consulted her about any work of his during its\r\nprogress towards completion.\r\n\r\nLate in April they made the acquaintance of one English (or rather, Irish)\r\nlady, who will always be gratefully remembered in connection with the\r\nShelleys.\r\n\r\nThis was Miss Curran, a daughter of the late Irish orator, who had been a\r\nfriend of Godwin's, and to whose death Mary refers in one of her letters\r\nfrom Marlow.[35]\r\n\r\nMary may, perhaps, have met her in Skinner Street; in any case, the old\r\nassociation was one link between them, and another was afforded by\r\nsimilarity in their present interests and occupations. Mary was very keen\r\nabout her drawing and painting. Miss Curran had taste, and some skill,\r\nand was vigorously prosecuting her art-studies in Rome. Portrait painting\r\nwas her especial line, and each of the Shelley party, at different times,\r\nsat to her; so that during the month of May they met almost daily, and\r\nbecame well acquainted.\r\n\r\nThis new interest, together with the unwillingness to bring to an end a\r\ntime at once so peaceful and so fruitful, caused them once and again to\r\npostpone their departure, originally fixed for the beginning of May. They\r\nstayed on longer than it is safe for English people to remain in Rome. Ah!\r\nwhy could no presentiment warn them of impending calamity? Could they,\r\nlike the Scottish witch in the ballad, have seen the fatal winding-sheet\r\ncreeping and clinging ever higher and higher round the wraith of their\r\ndoomed child, they would have fled from the face of Death. But they had no\r\nsuch foreboding.\r\n\r\nNot a fortnight after his portrait had been taken by Miss Curran, William\r\nshowed signs of illness. How it was that, knowing him to be so\r\ndelicate,--having learned by bitterest experience the danger of southern\r\nheat to an English-born infant,--having, as early as April, suspected the\r\nRoman air of causing \"weakness and depression, and even fever\" to Shelley\r\nhimself, how, after all this, they risked staying in Rome through May is\r\nhard to imagine.\r\n\r\nThey were to pay for their delay with the best part of their lives.\r\nWilliam sickened on the 25th, but had so far recovered by the 30th that\r\nhis parents, though they saw they ought to leave Rome as soon as he was\r\nfit to travel, were in no immediate anxiety about him, and were making\r\ntheir summer plans quite in a leisurely way; Mary writing to ask Mrs.\r\nGisborne to help them with some domestic arrangements, begging her to\r\ninquire about houses at Lucca or the Baths of Pisa, and to engage a\r\nservant for her.\r\n\r\nThe journal for this and the following days runs--\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, May 30._--Read Livy, and _Persiles and Sigismunda_. Draw.\r\n    Spend the evening at Miss Curran's.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, May 31._--Read Livy, and _Persiles and Sigismunda_. Draw.\r\n    Walk in the evening.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, June 1._--Drawing lesson. Read Livy. Walk by the Tiber.\r\n    Spend the evening with Miss Curran.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, June 2._--See Mr. Vogel's pictures. William becomes very\r\n    ill in the evening.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, June 3._--William is very ill, but gets better towards the\r\n    evening. Miss Curran calls.\r\n\r\nMary took this opportunity of begging her friend to write for her to Mrs.\r\nGisborne, telling her of the inevitable delay in their journey.\r\n\r\n    ROME, _Thursday, 3d June 1819_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MRS. GISBORNE--Mary tells me to write for her, for she is very\r\n    unwell, and also afflicted. Our poor little William is at present\r\n    very ill, and it will be impossible to quit Rome so soon as we\r\n    intended. She begs you, therefore, to forward the letters here, and\r\n    still to look for a servant for her, as she certainly intends coming\r\n    to Pisa. She will write to you a day or two before we set out.\r\n\r\n    William has a complaint of the stomach; but fortunately he is attended\r\n    by Mr. Bell, who is reckoned even in London one of the first English\r\n    surgeons.\r\n\r\n    I know you will be glad to hear that both Mary and Mr. Shelley would\r\n    be well in health were it not for the dreadful anxiety they now\r\n    suffer.\r\n\r\n      EMELIA CURRAN.\r\n\r\nTwo days after, Mary herself wrote a few lines to Mrs. Gisborne.\r\n\r\n    _5th June 1819._\r\n\r\n    William is in the greatest danger. We do not quite despair, yet we\r\n    have the least possible reason to hope.\r\n\r\n    I will write as soon as any change takes place. The misery of these\r\n    hours is beyond calculation. The hopes of my life are bound up in\r\n    him.--Ever yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n      M. W. S.\r\n\r\n    I am well, and so is Shelley, although he is more exhausted by\r\n    watching than I am. William is in a high fever.\r\n\r\nSixty death-like hours did Shelley watch, without closing his eyes. Clare,\r\nher own troubles forgotten in this moment of mortal suspense, was a\r\ndevoted nurse.\r\n\r\nAs for Mary, her very life ebbed with William's, but as yet she bore up.\r\nThere was no real hope from the first moment of the attack, but the poor\r\nchild made a hard struggle for life. Two more days and nights of anguish\r\nand terror and deadly sinking of heart,--and then, in the blank page\r\nfollowing _June 4_, the last date entered in the diary, are the words--\r\n\r\n    The journal ends here.--P. B. S.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 7th of June, at noonday, William died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nJUNE 1819-SEPTEMBER 1820\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not fifteen months since they had all left England; Shelley and\r\nMary with the sweet, blue-eyed \"Willmouse,\" and the pretty baby, Clara, so\r\nlike her father; Clare and the \"bluff, bright-eyed little Commodore,\"\r\nAllegra; the Swiss nurse and English nursemaid; a large and lively party,\r\nin spite of cares and anxieties and sorrows to come. In one short,\r\nspiritless paragraph Mary, on the 4th of August, summed up such history as\r\nthere was of the sad two months following on the blow which had left her\r\nchildless.\r\n\r\n    _Journal, Wednesday, August 4, 1819, Leghorn_ (Mary).--I begin my\r\n    journal on Shelley's birthday. We have now lived five years together;\r\n    and if all the events of the five years were blotted out, I might be\r\n    happy; but to have won and then cruelly to have lost, the associations\r\n    of four years, is not an accident to which the human mind can bend\r\n    without much suffering.\r\n\r\n    Since I left home I have read several books of Livy, _Clarissa\r\n    Harlowe_, the _Spectator_, a few novels, and am now reading the Bible,\r\n    and Lucan's _Pharsalia_, and Dante. Shelley is to-day twenty-seven\r\n    years of age. Write; read Lucan and the Bible. Shelley writes the\r\n    _Cenci_, and reads Plutarch's _Lives_. The Gisbornes call in the\r\n    evening. Shelley reads _Paradise Lost_ to me. Read two cantos of the\r\n    _Purgatorio_.\r\n\r\nThree days after William's death, Shelley, Mary, and Clare had left Rome\r\nfor Leghorn. Once more they were alone together--how different now from\r\nthe three heedless young things who, just five years before, had set out\r\nto walk through France with a donkey!\r\n\r\nShelley, then, a creature of feelings and theories, full of unbalanced\r\nimpulses, vague aspirations and undeveloped powers; inexperienced in\r\neverything but uncomprehended pain and the dim consciousness of\r\nhalf-realised mistakes. Mary, the fair, quiet, thoughtful girl, earnest\r\nand impassioned, calm and resolute, as ignorant of practical life as\r\nprecocious in intellect; with all her mind worshipping the same high\r\nideals as Shelley's, and with all her heart worshipping him as the\r\nincarnation of them. Clare her very opposite; excitable and enthusiastic,\r\ndemonstrative and capricious, clever, but silly; with a mind in which a\r\nsmattering of speculative philosophy, picked up in Godwin's house,\r\ncontended for the mastery with such social wisdom as she had picked up in\r\na boarding school. Both of them mere children in years. Now poor Clare was\r\nolder without being much wiser, saddened yet not sobered; suffering\r\nbitterly from her ambiguous position, yet unable or unwilling to put an\r\nend to it; the worse by her one great error, which had brought her to dire\r\ngrief; the better by one great affection--for her child,--the source of\r\nmuch sorrow, it is true, but also of truest joy of self-devotion, and the\r\nonly instrument of such discipline that ever she had.\r\n\r\nShelley had found what he wanted, the faithful heart which to his own\r\nafforded peace and stability and the balance which, then, he so much\r\nneeded; a kindred mind, worthy of the best his had to give; knowing and\r\nexpecting that best, too, and satisfied with nothing short of it. And his\r\nbest had responded. In these few years he had realised powers the extent\r\nof which could not have been foretold, and which might, without that\r\nsteady sympathy and support, have remained unfulfilled possibilities for\r\never. In spite of the far-reaching consequences of his errors, in spite of\r\ntorturing memories, in spite of ill-health, anxiety, poverty, vexation,\r\nand strife, the Shelley of _Queen Mab_ had become the Shelley of\r\n_Prometheus Unbound_ and the _Cenci_.\r\n\r\nOf this development he himself was conscious enough. In so far as he was\r\nknown to his contemporaries, it was only by his so-called atheistic\r\nopinions, and his departures theoretical and actual, from conventional\r\nsocial morality; and even these owed their notoriety, not to his genius,\r\nbut to the fact that they were such strange vagaries in the heir to a\r\nbaronetcy. In his new life he had, indeed, known the deepest grief as well\r\nas the purest love, but those griefs which are memorial shrines of love\r\ndid not paralyse him. They were rather among the influences which elicited\r\nthe utmost possibilities of his nature; his lost children, as lovely\r\nideals, were only half lost to him.\r\n\r\nBut with Mary it was otherwise. Her occupation was gone. When after the\r\ndeath of her first poor little baby, she wrote: \"Whenever I am left alone\r\nto my own thoughts, and do not read to divert them, they always come back\r\nto the same point--that I was a mother, and am so no longer;\" a new sense\r\nwas dawning in her which never had waned, and which, since William's\r\nbirth, had asserted itself as the key to her nature.\r\n\r\nShe had known very little of the realities of life when she left her\r\nfather's house with Shelley, and he, her first reality, belonged in many\r\nways more to the ideal than to the real world. But for her children, her\r\nassociation with him, while immeasurably expanding her mental powers,\r\nmight have tended to develop these at the expense of her emotional nature,\r\nand to starve or to stifle her human sympathies. In her children she found\r\nthe link which united her ideal love with the universal heart of mankind,\r\nand it was as a mother that she learned the sweet charities of human\r\nnature. This maternal love deepened her feelings towards her own father,\r\nit gave her sympathy with Clare and helped towards patience with her, it\r\nsaved her from overmuch literary abstraction, and prevented her from\r\npining when Shelley was buried in dreams or engrossed in work, and she\r\nloved these children with the unconscious passionate gratitude of a\r\nreserved nature towards anything that constrains from it the natural\r\nexpression of that fund of tenderness and devotion so often hidden away\r\nunder a perversely undemonstrative manner. Now, in one short year, all\r\nthis was gone, and she sank under the blow of William's loss. She could\r\nnot even find comfort in the thought of the baby to be born in autumn,\r\nfor, after the repeated rending asunder of beloved ties, she looked\r\nforward to new ones with fear and trembling, rather than with hope. The\r\nphysical reaction after the strain of long suspense and watching had told\r\nseriously on her health, never strong at these times; the efforts she had\r\nmade at Naples were no longer possible to her. Even Clare with all her\r\nmisery was, in one sense, better off than she, for Allegra _lived_. She\r\ntried to rise above her affliction, but her care for everything was gone;\r\nthe whole world seemed dull and indifferent. Poor Shelley, only too liable\r\nto depression at all times, and suffering bitterly himself from the loss\r\nof his beloved child, tried to keep up his spirits for Mary's sake.\r\n\r\n  Thou sittest on the hearth of pale Despair,\r\n      Where,\r\n  For thine own sake, I cannot follow thee.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the effort he thus made for her sake had a bracing effect on\r\nhimself, but the old Mary seemed gone,--lost,--and even he was powerless\r\nto bring her back; she could not follow him; any approach of seeming\r\nforgetfulness in others increased her depression and gloom.\r\n\r\nThe letter to Miss Curran, which follows, was written within three weeks\r\nof William's death.\r\n\r\n    LEGHORN, _27th June 1819_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MISS CURRAN--I wrote to you twice on our journey, and again\r\n    from this place, but I found the other day that Shelley had forgotten\r\n    to send the letter; and I have been so unwell with a cold these last\r\n    two or three days that I have not been able to write. We have taken an\r\n    airy house here, in the vicinity of Leghorn, for three months, and we\r\n    have not found it yet too hot. The country around us is pretty, so\r\n    that I daresay we shall do very well. I am going to write another\r\n    stupid letter to you, yet what can I do? I no sooner take up my pen\r\n    than my thoughts run away with me, and I cannot guide it except about\r\n    _one_ subject, and that I must avoid. So I entreat you to join this to\r\n    your many other kindnesses, and to excuse me. I have received the two\r\n    letters forwarded from Rome. My father's lawsuit is put off until\r\n    July. It will never be terminated. I hear that you have quitted the\r\n    pestilential air of Rome, and have gained a little health in the\r\n    country. Pray let us hear from you, for both Shelley and I are very\r\n    anxious--more than I can express--to know how you are. Let us hear\r\n    also, if you please, anything you may have done about the tomb, near\r\n    which I shall lie one day, and care not, for my own sake, how soon. I\r\n    never shall recover that blow; I feel it more than at Rome; the\r\n    thought never leaves me for a single moment; everything on earth has\r\n    lost its interest to me. You see I told you that I could only write to\r\n    you on one subject; how can I, since, do all I can (and I endeavour\r\n    very sincerely) I can think of no other, so I will leave off. Shelley\r\n    is tolerably well, and desires his kindest remembrances.--Most\r\n    affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n      MARY W. SHELLEY.\r\n\r\nTheir sympathetic friend, Leigh Hunt, grieved at the tone of her letters\r\nand at Shelley's account of her, tried to convey to her a little kindly\r\nadvice and encouragement.\r\n\r\n    8 YORK BUILDINGS, NEW ROAD.\r\n    _July 1819._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MARY--I was just about to write to you, as you will see by my\r\n    letter to Shelley, when I received yours. I need not say how it\r\n    grieves me to see you so dispirited. Not that I wonder at it under\r\n    such sufferings; but I know, at least I have often suspected, that you\r\n    have a tendency, partly constitutional perhaps, and partly owing to\r\n    the turn of your philosophy, to look over-intensely at the dark side\r\n    of human things; and they must present double dreariness through such\r\n    tears as you are now shedding. Pray consent to take care of your\r\n    health, as the ground of comfort; and cultivate your laurels on the\r\n    strength of it. I wish you would strike your pen into some more genial\r\n    subject (more obviously so than your last), and bring up a fountain of\r\n    gentle tears for us. That exquisite passage about the cottagers shows\r\n    what you could do.[36]\r\n\r\nMary received his counsels submissively, and would have carried them out\r\nif she could. But her nervous prostration was beyond her own power to cure\r\nor remove, and it was hard for others and impossible for herself to know\r\nhow far her dejected state was due to mental and how far to physical\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nShelley was not, and dared not be, idle. He worked at his Tragedy and\r\nfinished it; many of the Fragments, too, belong to this time. They are the\r\nspeech of pain, but those who can teach in song what they learn in\r\nsuffering have much, very much to be thankful for. Mary persisted in\r\nstudy; she even tried to write. But the spring of invention was low.\r\n\r\nShe exerted herself to send to Mrs. Hunt an account of their present life\r\nand surroundings.\r\n\r\n    LEGHORN, _28th August 1819_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MARIANNE--We are very dull at Leghorn, and I can therefore\r\n    write nothing to amuse you. We live in a little country house at the\r\n    end of a green lane, surrounded by a _podere_. These _poderi_ are just\r\n    the things Hunt would like. They are like our kitchen-gardens, with\r\n    the difference only that the beautiful fertility of the country gives\r\n    them. A large bed of cabbages is very unpicturesque in England, but\r\n    here the furrows are alternated with rows of grapes festooned on their\r\n    supporters, and the hedges are of myrtle, which have just ceased to\r\n    flower; their flower has the sweetest faint smell in the world, like\r\n    some delicious spice. Green grassy walks lead you through the vines.\r\n    The people are always busy, and it is pleasant to see three or four of\r\n    them transform in one day a bed of Indian corn to one of celery. They\r\n    work this hot weather in their shirts, or smock-frocks (but their\r\n    breasts are bare), their brown legs nearly the colour, only with a\r\n    rich tinge of red in it, of the earth they turn up. They sing, not\r\n    very melodiously, but very loud, Rossini's music, \"Mi rivedrai, ti\r\n    rivedro,\" and they are accompanied by the _cicala_, a kind of little\r\n    beetle, that makes a noise with its tail as loud as Johnny can sing;\r\n    they live on trees; and three or four together are enough to deafen\r\n    you. It is to the _cicala_ that Anacreon has addressed an ode which\r\n    they call \"To a Grasshopper\" in the English translations.\r\n\r\n    Well, here we live. I never am in good spirits--often in very bad; and\r\n    Hunt's portrait has already seen me shed so many tears that, if it had\r\n    his heart as well as his eyes, he would weep too in pity. But no more\r\n    of this, or a tear will come now, and there is no use for that.\r\n\r\n    By the bye, a hint Hunt gave about portraits. The Italian painters are\r\n    very bad; they might make a nose like Shelley's, and perhaps a mouth,\r\n    but I doubt it; but there would be no expression about it. They have\r\n    no notion of anything except copying again and again their Old\r\n    Masters; and somehow mere copying, however divine the original, does a\r\n    great deal more harm than good.\r\n\r\n    Shelley has written a good deal, and I have done very little since I\r\n    have been in Italy. I have had so much to see, and so many vexations,\r\n    independently of those which God has kindly sent to wean me from the\r\n    world if I were too fond of it. Shelley has not had good health by any\r\n    means, and, when getting better, fate has ever contrived something to\r\n    pull him back. He never was better than the last month of his stay in\r\n    Rome, except the last week--then he watched sixty miserable death-like\r\n    hours without closing his eyes; and you may think what good that did\r\n    him.\r\n\r\n    We see the _Examiners_ regularly now, four together, just two months\r\n    after the publication of the last. These are very delightful to us. I\r\n    have a word to say to Hunt of what he says concerning Italian dancing.\r\n    The Italians dance very badly. They dress for their dances in the\r\n    ugliest manner; the men in little doublets, with a hat and feather;\r\n    they are very stiff; nothing but their legs move; and they twirl and\r\n    jump with as little grace as may be. It is not for their dancing, but\r\n    their pantomime, that the Italians are famous. You remember what we\r\n    told you of the ballet of _Othello_. They tell a story by action, so\r\n    that words appear perfectly superfluous things for them. In that they\r\n    are graceful, agile, impressive, and very affecting; so that I delight\r\n    in nothing so much as a deep tragic ballet. But the dancing, unless,\r\n    as they sometimes do, they dance as common people (for instance, the\r\n    dance of joy of the Venetian citizens on the return of Othello), is\r\n    very bad indeed.\r\n\r\n    I am very much obliged to you for all your kind offers and wishes.\r\n    Hunt would do Shelley a great deal of good, but that we may not think\r\n    of; his spirits are tolerably good. But you do not tell me how you get\r\n    on; how Bessy is, and where she is. Remember me to her. Clare is\r\n    learning thorough bass and singing. We pay four crowns a month for her\r\n    master, lessons three times a week; cheap work this, is it not? At\r\n    Rome we paid three shillings a lesson and the master stayed two hours.\r\n    The one we have now is the best in Leghorn.\r\n\r\n    I write in the morning, read Latin till 2, when we dine; then I read\r\n    some English book, and two cantos of Dante with Shelley. In the\r\n    evening our friends the Gisbornes come, so we are not perfectly alone.\r\n    I like Mrs. Gisborne very much indeed, but her husband is most\r\n    dreadfully dull; and as he is always with her, we have not so much\r\n    pleasure in her company as we otherwise should....\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Mrs. Gisborne, \"charming from her frank and\r\naffectionate nature,\" and full of intellectual sympathy with the Shelleys,\r\nwas a boon indeed at this melancholy time. Through her Shelley was led to\r\nthe study of Spanish, and the appearance on the scene of Charles\r\nClairmont, who had just passed a year in Spain, was an additional stimulus\r\nin this direction. Together they read several of Calderon's plays, from\r\nwhich Shelley derived the greatest delight, and which enabled him for a\r\ntime to forget everyday life and its troubles. Another diversion to his\r\nthoughts was the scheme of a steamboat which should ply between Leghorn\r\nand Marseilles, to be constructed by Henry Reveley, mainly at Shelley's\r\nexpense. He was elated at promoting a project which he conceived to be of\r\ngreat public usefulness and importance, and happy at being able to do a\r\nfriend a good turn. He followed every stage of the steamer's construction\r\nwith keen interest, and was much disappointed when the idea was given up,\r\nas, after some months, it was; not, however, until much time, labour, and\r\nmoney had been expended on it.\r\n\r\nMary, though she endeavoured to fill the blanks in her existence by\r\nassiduous reading, could not escape care. Clare was in perpetual thirst\r\nfor news of her Allegra, and Godwin spared them none of his usual\r\ncomplaints. He, too, was much concerned at the depressed tone of Mary's\r\nletters, which seemed to him quite disproportionate to the occasion, and\r\nthought it his duty to convince her, by reasoning, that she was not so\r\nunhappy as she thought herself to be.\r\n\r\n    SKINNER STREET, _9th September 1819_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MARY--Your letter of 19th August is very grievous to me,\r\n    inasmuch as you represent me as increasing the degree of your\r\n    uneasiness and depression.\r\n\r\n    You must, however, allow me the privilege of a father and a\r\n    philosopher in expostulating with you on this depression. I cannot\r\n    but consider it as lowering your character in a memorable degree, and\r\n    putting you quite among the commonalty and mob of your sex, when I had\r\n    thought I saw in you symptoms entitling you to be ranked among those\r\n    noble spirits that do honour to our nature. What a falling off is\r\n    here! How bitterly is so inglorious a change to be deplored!\r\n\r\n    What is it you want that you have not? You have the husband of your\r\n    choice, to whom you seem to be unalterably attached, a man of high\r\n    intellectual attainments, whatever I and some other persons may think\r\n    of his morality, and the defects under this last head, if they be not\r\n    (as you seem to think) imaginary, at least do not operate as towards\r\n    you. You have all the goods of fortune, all the means of being useful\r\n    to others, and shining in your proper sphere. But you have lost a\r\n    child: and all the rest of the world, all that is beautiful, and all\r\n    that has a claim upon your kindness, is nothing, because a child of\r\n    two years old is dead.\r\n\r\n    The human species may be divided into two great classes: those who\r\n    lean on others for support, and those who are qualified to support. Of\r\n    these last, some have one, some five, and some ten talents. Some can\r\n    support a husband, a child, a small but respectable circle of friends\r\n    and dependents, and some can support a world, contributing by their\r\n    energies to advance their whole species one or more degrees in the\r\n    scale of perfectibility. The former class sit with their arms crossed,\r\n    a prey to apathy and languor, of no use to any earthly creature, and\r\n    ready to fall from their stools if some kind soul, who might\r\n    compassionate, but who cannot respect them, did not come from moment\r\n    to moment and endeavour to set them up again. You were formed by\r\n    nature to belong to the best of these classes, but you seem to be\r\n    shrinking away, and voluntarily enrolling yourself among the worst.\r\n\r\n    Above all things, I entreat you, do not put the miserable delusion on\r\n    yourself, to think there is something fine, and beautiful, and\r\n    delicate, in giving yourself up, and agreeing to be nothing. Remember\r\n    too, though at first your nearest connections may pity you in this\r\n    state, yet that when they see you fixed in selfishness and ill\r\n    humour, and regardless of the happiness of every one else, they will\r\n    finally cease to love you, and scarcely learn to endure you.\r\n\r\n    The other parts of your letter afford me much satisfaction. Depend\r\n    upon it, there is no maxim more true or more important than this;\r\n    Frankness of communication takes off bitterness. True philosophy\r\n    invites all communication, and withholds none.\r\n\r\nSuch a letter tended rather to check frankness of communication than to\r\nbind up a broken heart. Poor Mary's feelings appear in her letter to Miss\r\nCurran, with whom she was in correspondence about a monumental stone for\r\nthe tomb in Rome.\r\n\r\n    The most pressing entreaties on my part, as well as Clare's, cannot\r\n    draw a single line from Venice. It is now six months since we have\r\n    heard, even in an indirect manner, from there. God knows what has\r\n    happened, or what has not! I suppose Shelley must go to see what has\r\n    become of the little thing; yet how or when I know not, for he has\r\n    never recovered from his fatigue at Rome, and continually frightens me\r\n    by the approaches of a dysentery. Besides, we must remove. My lying-in\r\n    and winter are coming on, so we are wound up in an inextricable\r\n    dilemma. This is very hard upon us; and I have no consolation in any\r\n    quarter, for my misfortune has not altered the tone of my Father's\r\n    letters, so that I gain care every day. And can you wonder that my\r\n    spirits suffer terribly? that time is a weight to me? And I see no end\r\n    to this. Well, to talk of something more interesting, Shelley has\r\n    finished his tragedy, and it is sent to London to be presented to the\r\n    managers. It is still a _deep secret_, and only one person, Peacock\r\n    (who presents it), knows anything about it in England. With Shelley's\r\n    public and private enemies, it would certainly fall if known to be\r\n    his; his sister-in-law alone would hire enough people to damn it. It\r\n    is written with great care, and we are in hopes that its story is\r\n    sufficiently polished not to shock the audience. We shall see.\r\n    Continue to direct to us at Leghorn, for if we should be gone, they\r\n    will be faithfully forwarded to us. And when you return to Rome just\r\n    have the kindness to inquire if there should be any stray letter for\r\n    us at the post-office. I hope the country air will do you real good.\r\n    You must take care of yourself. Remember that one day you will return\r\n    to England, and that you may be happier there.--Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n      M. W. S.\r\n\r\nAt the end of September they removed to Florence, where they had engaged\r\npleasant lodgings for six months. The time of Mary's confinement was now\r\napproaching, an event, in Shelley's words, \"more likely than any other to\r\nretrieve her from some part of her present melancholy depression.\"\r\n\r\nThey travelled by short, easy stages; stopping for a day at Pisa to pay a\r\nvisit to a lady with whom from this time their intercourse was frequent\r\nand familiar. This was Lady Mountcashel, who had, when a young girl, been\r\nMary Wollstonecraft's pupil, and between whom and her teacher so warm an\r\nattachment had existed as to arouse the jealousy and dislike of her\r\nmother, Lady Kingsborough. She had long since been separated from Lord\r\nMountcashel, and lived in Italy with a Mr. Tighe and their two daughters,\r\nLaura and Nerina. As Lady Mountcashel she had entertained Godwin at her\r\nhouse during his visit to Ireland after his first wife's death. She is\r\ndescribed by him as a remarkable person, \"a republican and a democrat in\r\nall their sternness, yet with no ordinary portion either of understanding\r\nor good nature.\" In dress and appearance she was somewhat singular, and\r\nhad that disregard for public opinion on such matters which is habitually\r\nimplied in the much abused term \"strong-minded.\" In this respect she had\r\nnow considerably toned down. Her views on the relations of the sexes were\r\nthose of William Godwin, and she had put them into practice. But she and\r\nthe gentleman with whom she lived in permanent, though irregular, union\r\nhad succeeded in constraining, by their otherwise exemplary life, the\r\ngeneral respect and esteem. They were known as \"Mr. and Mrs. Mason,\" and\r\nhad so far lived down criticism that their actual position had come to be\r\nignored or forgotten by those around them. Mr. Tighe, or \"Tatty,\" as he\r\nwas familiarly called by his few intimates, was of a retiring disposition,\r\na lover of books and of solitude. Mrs. Mason was as remarkable for her\r\nstrong practical common sense as for her talents and cultivation and the\r\nliberality of her views. She had a considerable knowledge of the world,\r\nand was looked up to as a model of good breeding, and an oracle on matters\r\nof deportment and propriety.\r\n\r\nShe had kept up correspondence with Godwin, and her acquaintance with the\r\nShelleys was half made before she saw them. She conceived an immediate\r\naffection for Mary, as well for her own as for her mother's sake, and was\r\nto prove a constant and valuable friend, not to her only, but to Shelley,\r\nand most especially to Clare.\r\n\r\nAfter a week in Florence, Mary's journal was resumed.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, October 9._--Arrive at Florence. Read Massinger. Shelley\r\n    begins Clarendon; reads Massinger, and Plato's _Republic_. Clare has\r\n    her first singing lesson on Saturday. Go to the opera and see a\r\n    beautiful ballet\r\n\r\n    _Monday, October 11._--Read Horace; work. Go to the Gallery. Shelley\r\n    finishes the first volume of Clarendon. Read the _Little Thief_.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, October 20._--Finish the First Book of Horace's Odes.\r\n    Work, walk, read, etc. On Saturday letters are sent to England. On\r\n    Tuesday one to Venice. Shelley visits the Galleries. Reads Spenser and\r\n    Clarendon aloud.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, October 28._--Work; read; copy _Peter Bell_. Monday night a\r\n    great fright with Charles Clairmont. Shelley reads Clarendon aloud and\r\n    _Plato's Republic_. Walk. On Thursday the protest from the Bankers.\r\n    Shelley writes to them, and to Peacock, Longdill, and H. Smith.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, November 9._--Read Madame de Sevigne. Bad news from London.\r\n    Shelley reads Clarendon aloud, and Plato. He writes to Papa.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of November a son was born to the Shelleys, and brought the\r\nfirst true balm of consolation to his poor mother's heart.\r\n\r\n    \"You may imagine,\" wrote Shelley to Leigh Hunt, \"that this is a great\r\n    relief and a great comfort to me amongst all my misfortunes.... Poor\r\n    Mary begins (for the first time) to look a little consoled; for we\r\n    have spent, as you may imagine, a miserable five months.\"\r\n\r\nThe child was healthy and pretty, and very like William. Neither Mary's\r\nstrength nor her spirits were altogether re-established for some time, but\r\nthe birth of \"Percy Florence\" was, none the less, the beginning of a new\r\nlife for her. She turned, with the renewed energy of hope, to her literary\r\nwork and studies. One of her first tasks was to transcribe the just\r\nwritten fourth act of _Prometheus Unbound_. She had work of her own on\r\nhand too; a historical novel, _Castruccio, Prince of Lucca_ (afterwards\r\npublished as _Valperga_), a laborious but very congenial task, which\r\noccupied her for many months.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed all the solace of new and tender ties, all the animating\r\ninterest of intellectual pursuits, was sorely needed to counteract the\r\nwearing effect of harassing cares and threatening calamities. Godwin was\r\nnow being pressed for the accumulated unpaid house-rent of many years; so\r\nmany that, when the call came, it was unexpected by him, and he challenged\r\nits justice. He had engaged in a law-suit on the matter, which he\r\neventually lost. The only point which appeared to admit of no reasonable\r\ndoubt was that Shelley would shortly be called upon to find a large sum of\r\nmoney for him, and this at a time when he was himself in unexpected\r\npecuniary straits, owing to the non-arrival of his own remittances from\r\nEngland--a circumstance rendered doubly vexatious by the fact that a large\r\nportion of the money was pledged to Henry Reveley for the furtherance of\r\nhis steamboat. A draft for L200, destined for this purpose, was returned,\r\nprotested by Shelley's bankers. And though the money was ultimately\r\nrecovered, its temporary loss caused no small alarm. Meanwhile every mail\r\nbrought letters from Godwin of the most harrowing nature; the philosophy\r\nwhich he inculcated in a case of bereavement was null and void where\r\nimpending bankruptcy was concerned. He well knew how to work on his\r\ndaughter's feelings, and he did not spare her. Poor Shelley was at his\r\nwits' end.\r\n\r\n    \"Mary is well,\" he wrote (in December) to the Gisbornes; \"but for this\r\n    affair in London I think her spirits would be good. What shall I, what\r\n    can I, what ought I to do? You cannot picture to yourself my\r\n    perplexity.\"\r\n\r\nIt appeared not unlikely that he might even have to go to England, a\r\njourney for which his present state of health quite unfitted him, and\r\nwhich he could not but be conscious would be no permanent remedy, but only\r\na temporary alleviation, of Godwin's thoroughly unsound circumstances.\r\nMary, in her grief for her father, began to think that the best thing for\r\nhim might be to leave England altogether and settle abroad; an idea from\r\nwhich Mrs. Mason, with her strong sagacity, earnestly dissuaded her.\r\n\r\nHer views on the point were expressed in a letter to Shelley Mary had\r\nwritten asking her if she could give Charles Clairmont any introductions\r\nat Vienna, where he had now gone to seek his fortune as a teacher of\r\nlanguages; and also begging for such assistance as she might be able to\r\nlend in the matter of obtaining access to historical documents or other\r\nMS. bearing on the subjects of Mary's projected novel.\r\n\r\n    MRS. MASON TO SHELLEY.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR--I deferred answering your letter till this post in hopes\r\n    of being able to send some recommendations for your friend at Vienna,\r\n    in which I have been disappointed; and I have now also a letter from\r\n    my dear Mary; so I will answer both together. It gives me great\r\n    pleasure to hear such a good account of the little boy and his\r\n    mother.... I am sorry to perceive that your visit to Pisa will be so\r\n    much retarded; but I admire Mary's courage and industry. I sincerely\r\n    regret that it is not in my power to be of service to her in this\r\n    undertaking.... All I can say is, that when you have got all you can\r\n    there (where I suppose the manuscript documents are chiefly to be\r\n    found) and that you come to this place, I have scarcely any doubt of\r\n    being able to obtain for you many books on the subject which interests\r\n    you. Probably everything in print which relates to it is as easy to be\r\n    had here as at Florence.... I am very sorry indeed to think that Mr.\r\n    Godwin's affairs are in such a bad way, and think he would be much\r\n    happier if he had nothing to do with trade; but I am afraid he would\r\n    not be comfortable out of England. You who are young do not mind the\r\n    thousand little wants that men of his age are not habituated to; and\r\n    I, who have been so many years a vagabond on the face of the earth,\r\n    have long since forgotten them; but I have seen people of my age much\r\n    discomposed at the absence of long-accustomed trifles; and though\r\n    philosophy supports in great matters, it seldom vanquishes the small\r\n    everydayisms of life. I say this that Mary may not urge her father too\r\n    much to leave England. It may sound odd, but I can't help thinking\r\n    that Mrs. Godwin would enjoy a tour in foreign countries more than he\r\n    would. The physical inferiority of women sometimes teaches them to\r\n    support or overlook little inconveniences better than men.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"I am very sorry,\" she writes to Mary in another letter, \"to find you\r\n    still suffer from low spirits. I was in hopes the little boy would\r\n    have been the best remedy for that. Words of consolation are but empty\r\n    sounds, for to time alone it belongs to wear out the tears of\r\n    affliction. However, a woman who gives milk should make every exertion\r\n    to be cheerful on account of the child she nourishes.\"\r\n\r\nWhether the plan for Godwin's expatriation was ever seriously proposed to\r\nhim or not, it was, at any rate, never carried out. But none the less for\r\nthis did the Shelleys live in the shadow of his gloom, which co-operated\r\nwith their own pecuniary strait, previously alluded to, and with the\r\nnipping effects of an unwontedly severe winter, to make life still\r\ndifficult and dreary for them.\r\n\r\n    \"Shelley Calderonised on the late weather,\" wrote Mary to Mrs.\r\n    Gisborne; \"he called it an epic of rain with an episode of frost, and\r\n    a few similes concerning fine weather. We have heard from England,\r\n    although not from the Bankers; but Peacock's letter renders the affair\r\n    darker than ever. Ah! my dear friend, you, in your slow and sure way\r\n    of proceeding, ought hardly to have united yourself to our eccentric\r\n    star. I am afraid that you will repent it, and it grieves us both more\r\n    than you can imagine that all should have gone so ill; but I think we\r\n    may rest assured that this is delay, and not loss; it can be nothing\r\n    else. I write in haste--a carriage at the door to take me out, and\r\n    _Percy_ asleep on my knee. Adieu. Charles is at Vienna by this\r\n    time.\"...\r\n\r\nThey had intended remaining six months at Florence, but the place suited\r\nShelley so ill that they took advantage of the first favourable change in\r\nthe weather, at the end of January, to remove to Pisa, where the climate\r\nwas milder, and where they now had pleasant friends in the Masons at \"Casa\r\nSilva.\" They wished, too, to consult the celebrated Italian surgeon,\r\nVacca, on the subject of Shelley's health. Vacca's advice took the shape\r\nof an earnest exhortation to him to abstain from drugs and remedies, to\r\nlive a healthy life, and to leave his complaint, as far as possible, to\r\nnature. And, though he continued liable to attacks of pain and illness,\r\nand on one occasion had a severe nervous attack, the climate of Pisa\r\nproved in the end more suitable to him than any other, and for more than\r\ntwo years he remained there or in the immediate neighbourhood. He and Mary\r\nwere never more industrious than at this time; reading extensively, and\r\nworking together on a translation of Spinoza they had begun at Florence,\r\nand which occupied them, at intervals, for many months. Little Percy, a\r\nmost healthy and satisfactory infant, had in March an attack of measles,\r\nbut so slight as to cause no anxiety. Once, however, during the summer\r\nthey had a fright about him, when an unusually alarming letter from her\r\nfather upset Mary so much as to cause in her nursling, through her,\r\nsymptoms of an illness similar to that which had destroyed little Clara.\r\nOn this occasion she authorised Shelley, at his earnest request, to\r\nintercept future letters of the kind, an authority of which he had to\r\navail himself at no distant date, telling Godwin that his domestic peace,\r\nMary's health and happiness, and his child's life, could no longer be\r\nentirely at his mercy.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that his own nervous ailments kept their hold of him. And to\r\nmake matters better for him and for Mary, Paolo, the rascally Italian\r\nservant whom they had dismissed at Naples, now concocted a plot for\r\nextorting money from Shelley by accusing him of frightful crimes. Legal\r\naid had to be called in to silence him. To this end they employed an\r\nattorney of Leghorn, named Del Rosso, and, for convenience of\r\ncommunication, they occupied for a few weeks Casa Ricci, the Gisbornes'\r\nhouse there, the owners being absent in England. Shelley made Henry\r\nReveley's workshop his study. Hence he addressed his poetical \"Letter to\r\nMaria Gisborne,\" and here too it was that \"on a beautiful summer evening\r\nwhile wandering among the lanes, whose myrtle hedges were the bowers of\r\nthe fireflies (they) heard the carolling of the skylark, which inspired\r\none of the most beautiful of his poems.\"[37]\r\n\r\nIf external surroundings could have made them happy they might have been\r\nso now, but Shelley, though in better health, was very nervous. Paolo's\r\nscandal and the legal affair embittered his life, to an extent difficult\r\nindeed to estimate, for it is certain that for some one else's sake,\r\nthough _whose_ sake has never transpired, he had accepted when at Naples\r\nresponsibilities at once delicate and compromising. Paolo had knowledge of\r\nthe matter, and used this knowledge partly to revenge himself on Shelley\r\nfor dismissing him from his service, partly to try and extort money from\r\nhim by intimidation. The Shelleys hoped they had \"crushed him\" with Del\r\nRosso's help, but they could not be certain, because, as Mary wrote to\r\nMiss Curran, they \"could only guess at his accomplices.\" With Shelley in a\r\nstate of extreme nervous irritability, with Mary deprived of repose by her\r\nanguish on her father's account and her feverish anxiety to help him, with\r\nClare unsettled and miserable about Allegra, venting her misery by writing\r\nto Byron letters unreasonable and provoking, though excusable, and then\r\nregretting having sent them, they were not likely to be the most cheerful\r\nor harmonious of trios.\r\n\r\nThe weather became intolerably hot by the end of August, and they migrated\r\nto Casa Prinni, at the Baths of S. Giuliano di Pisa. The beauty of this\r\nplace, and the delightful climate, refreshed and invigorated them all.\r\nThey spent two or three days in seeing Lucca and the country around, when\r\nShelley wrote the _Witch of Atlas_. Exquisite poem as it is, it was, in\r\nMary's mood of the moment, a disappointment to her. Ever since the _Cenci_\r\nshe had been strongly impressed with the conviction that if he could but\r\nwrite on subjects of universal _human_ interest, instead of indulging in\r\nthose airy creations of fancy which demand in the reader a sympathetic,\r\nbut rare, quality of imagination, he would put himself more in touch with\r\nhis contemporaries, who so greatly misunderstood him, and that, once he\r\nhad elicited a responsive feeling in other men, this would be a source of\r\nprofound happiness and of fresh and healthy inspiration to himself. \"I\r\nstill think I was right,\" she says, woman-like, in the _Notes to the Poems\r\nof 1820_, written long after Shelley's death. So from one point of view\r\nshe undoubtedly was, but there are some things which cannot be\r\nconstrained. Shelley was Shelley, and at the moment when he was moved to\r\nwrite a poem like the _Witch of Atlas_, it was useless to wish that it\r\nhad been something quite different.\r\n\r\nHis next poem was to be inspired by a human subject, and perhaps then poor\r\nMary would have preferred a second Witch of Atlas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 1820-AUGUST 1821\r\n\r\n\r\nThe baths were of great use to Shelley in allaying his nervous\r\nirritability. Such an improvement in him could not be without a\r\ncorresponding beneficial effect on Mary. In the study of Greek, which she\r\nhad begun with him at Leghorn, she found a new and wellnigh inexhaustible\r\nfund of intellectual pleasure. Their life, though very quiet, was somewhat\r\nmore varied than it had been at Leghorn, partly owing to their being\r\nwithin easy reach of Pisa and of their friends at Casa Silva.\r\n\r\nThe Gisbornes had returned from England, and, during a short absence of\r\nClare's, Mary tried, but ineffectually, to persuade Mrs. Gisborne to come\r\nand occupy her room for a time. Some circumstance had arisen which led\r\nshortly after to a misunderstanding between the two families, soon over,\r\nbut painful while it lasted. It was probably connected with the\r\nabandonment of the projected steamboat; Henry Reveley, while in England,\r\nhaving changed his mind and reconsidered his future plans.\r\n\r\nIn October a curiously wet season set in.\r\n\r\n    _Journal, Wednesday, October 18._--Rain till 1 o'clock. At sunset the\r\n    arch of cloud over the west clears away; a few black islands float in\r\n    the serene; the moon rises; the clouds spot the sky, but the depth of\r\n    heaven is clear. The nights are uncommonly warm. Write. Shelley reads\r\n    _Hyperion_ aloud. Read Greek.\r\n\r\n      My thoughts arise and fade in solitude;\r\n      The verse that would invest them melts away\r\n      Like moonlight in the heaven of spreading day.\r\n      How beautiful they were, how firm they stood,\r\n      Flecking the starry sky like woven pearl.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, October 20._--Shelley goes to Florence. Write. Read Greek.\r\n    Wind N.W., but more cloudy than yesterday, yet sometimes the sun\r\n    shines out; the wind high. Read Villani.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, October 21._--Rain in the night and morning; very cloudy;\r\n    not an air stirring; the leaves of the trees quite still. After a\r\n    showery morning it clears up somewhat, and the sun shines. Read\r\n    Villani, and ride to Pisa.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, October 22._--Rainy night and rainy morning; as bad weather\r\n    as is possible in Italy. A little patience and we shall have St.\r\n    Martin's summer. At sunset the arch of clear sky appears where it\r\n    sets, becoming larger and larger, until at 7 o'clock the dark clouds\r\n    are alone over Monte Nero; Venus shines bright in the clear azure, and\r\n    the trunks of the trees are tinged with the silvery light of the\r\n    rising moon. Write, and read Villani. Shelley returns with Medwin.\r\n    Read _Sismondi_.\r\n\r\nOf Tom Medwin, Shelley's cousin and great admirer, who now for the first\r\ntime appeared on the scene, they were to see, if anything, more than they\r\nwished.\r\n\r\nHe was a lieutenant on half-pay, late of the 8th Dragoons; much addicted\r\nto literature, and with no mean opinion of his own powers in that line.\r\n\r\n    _Journal, Tuesday, October 24._--Rainy night and morning; it does not\r\n    rain in the afternoon. Shelley and Medwin go to Pisa. Walk; write.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, October 25._--Rain all night. The banks of the Serchio\r\n    break, and by dark all the baths are overflowed. Water four feet deep\r\n    in our house. \"The weather fine.\"\r\n\r\nThis flood brought their stay at the Baths to a sudden end. As soon as\r\nthey could get lodgings they returned to Pisa. Here, not long after,\r\nMedwin fell ill, and was six weeks invalided in their house. They showed\r\nhim the greatest kindness; Shelley nursing him like a brother. His society\r\nwas, for a time, a tolerably pleasant change; he knew Spanish, and read\r\nwith Shelley a great deal in that language, but he had no depth or breadth\r\nof mind, and his literary vanity and egotism made him at last what Mary\r\nShelley described as a _seccatura_, for which the nearest English\r\nequivalent is, a bore.\r\n\r\n    _Journal, Sunday, November 12._--Percy's birthday. A divine day; sunny\r\n    and cloudless; somewhat cold in the evening. It would be pleasant\r\n    enough living in Pisa if one had a carriage and could escape from\r\n    one's house to the country without mingling with the inhabitants, but\r\n    the Pisans and the Scolari, in short, the whole population, are such\r\n    that it would sound strange to an English person if I attempted to\r\n    express what I feel concerning them--crawling and crab-like through\r\n    their sapping streets. Read _Corinne_. Write.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, November 13._--Finish _Corinne_. Write. My eyes keep me from\r\n    all study; this is very provoking.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, November 14._--Write. Read Homer, Targione, and Spanish. A\r\n    rainy day. Shelley reads Calderon.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, November 23._--Write. Read Greek and Spanish. Medwin ill.\r\n    Play at chess.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, November 24._--Read Greek, Villani, and Spanish with M....\r\n    Pacchiani in the evening. A rainy and cloudy day.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, December 1._--Read Greek, _Don Quixote_, Calderon, and\r\n    Villani. Pacchiani comes in the evening. Visit La Viviani. Walk.\r\n    Sgricci is introduced. Go to a _funzione_ on the death of a student.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, December 2._--Write an Italian letter to Hunt. Read\r\n    _Oedipus_, _Don Quixote_, and Calderon. Pacchiani and a Greek prince\r\n    call--Prince Mavrocordato.\r\n\r\nIn these few entries occur four new and remarkable names. Pacchiani, who\r\nhad been, if he was not still, a university professor, but who was none\r\nthe less an adventurer and an impostor; in orders, moreover, which only\r\nserved as a cloak for his hypocrisy; clever withal, and eloquent; well\r\nknowing where, and how, to ingratiate himself. He amused, but did not\r\nplease the Shelleys. He was, however, one of those people who know\r\neverybody, and through him they made several acquaintances; among them the\r\ncelebrated Improvisatore, Sgricci, and the young Greek statesman and\r\npatriot, Prince Alexander Mavrocordato. With the improvisations of\r\nSgricci, his eloquence, his _entrain_, both Mary and Clare were fairly\r\ncarried away with excitement. Older, experienced folk looked with a more\r\ncritical eye on his performances, but to these English girls the\r\nexhibition was an absolute novelty, and seemed inspired. Sgricci was\r\nduring this winter a frequent visitor at \"Casa Galetti.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Mavrocordato proved deeply interesting, both to Mary and Shelley.\r\nHe \"was warmed by those aspirations for the independence of his country\r\nwhich filled the hearts of many of his countrymen,\" and in the revolution\r\nwhich, shortly afterwards, broke out there, he was to play an important\r\npart, as one of the foremost of modern Greek statesmen. To him, at a\r\nsomewhat later date, was dedicated Shelley's lyrical drama of _Hellas_;\r\n\"as an imperfect token of admiration, sympathy, and friendship.\"\r\n\r\nThis new acquaintance came to Mary just when her interest in the Greek\r\nlanguage and literature was most keen. Before long the prince had\r\nvolunteered to help her in her studies, and came often to give her Greek\r\nlessons, receiving instruction in English in return.\r\n\r\n    \"Do you not envy my luck,\" she wrote to Mrs. Gisborne, \"that having\r\n    begun Greek, an amiable, young, agreeable, and learned Greek prince\r\n    comes every morning to give me a lesson of an hour and a half. This is\r\n    the result of an acquaintance with Pacchiani. So you see, even the\r\n    Devil has his use.\"\r\n\r\nThe acquaintance with Pacchiani had already had another and a yet more\r\nmemorable result, which affected Mary none the less that it did so\r\nindirectly. Through him they had come to know Emilia Viviani, the noble\r\nand beautiful Italian girl, immured by her father in a convent at Pisa\r\nuntil such time as a husband could be found for her who would take a wife\r\nwithout a dowry. Shelley's acquaintance with Emilia was an episode, which\r\nat one time looked like an era, in his existence. An era in his poetry it\r\nundoubtedly was, since it is to her that the _Epipsychidion_ is addressed.\r\n\r\nMary and Clare were the first to see the lovely captive, and were struck\r\nwith astonishment and admiration. But on Shelley the impression she made\r\nwas overwhelming, and took possession of his whole nature. Her\r\nextraordinary beauty and grace, her powers of mind and conversation,\r\nwarmed by that glow of genius so exclusively southern, another variety of\r\nwhich had captivated them all in Sgricci, and which to northern minds\r\nseems something phenomenal and inspired,--these were enough to subdue any\r\nman, and, when added to the halo of interest shed around her by her\r\nmisfortunes and her misery, made her, to Shelley, irresistible.\r\n\r\nAll his sentiments, when aroused, were passions; he pitied, he\r\nsympathised, he admired and venerated passionately; he scorned, hated, and\r\ncondemned passionately too. But he never was swayed by any love that did\r\nnot excite his imagination: his attachments were ever in proportion to\r\nthe power of idealisation evoked in him by their objects. And never,\r\nsurely, was there a subject for idealisation like Emilia; the Spirit of\r\nIntellectual Beauty in the form of a goddess; the captive maiden waiting\r\nfor her Deliverer; the perfect embodiment of immortal Truth and\r\nLoveliness, held in chains by the powers of cruelty, tyranny, and\r\nhypocrisy.\r\n\r\nShe was no goddess, poor Emilia, as indeed he soon found out; only a\r\nlovely young creature of vivid intelligence and a temperament in which\r\nItalian ardour was mingled with Italian subtlety; every germ of sentiment\r\nmagnified and intensified in outward effect by fervour of manner and\r\nnatural eloquence; the very reverse of human nature in the north, where\r\ndepth of feeling is apt to be in proportion to its inveterate dislike of\r\ndiscovery, where warmth can rarely shake off self-consciousness, and where\r\nmany of the best men and women are so much afraid of seeming a whit better\r\nthan they really are, that they take pains to appear worse. Rightly\r\nbalanced, the whole sum of Emilia's gifts and graces would have weighed\r\nlittle against Mary's nobleness of heart and unselfish devotion; her\r\ntalents might not even have borne serious comparison with Clare's\r\nvivacious intellect. But to Shelley, haunted by a vision of perfection,\r\nand ever apt to recognise in a mortal image \"the likeness of that which\r\nis, perhaps, eternal,\"[38] she seemed a revelation, and, like all\r\nrevelations, supreme, unique, superseding for the time every other\r\npossibility. It was a brief madness, a trance of inspiration, and its\r\nduration was counted only by days. They met for the first time early in\r\nDecember. By the 10th she was corresponding with him as her _diletto\r\nfratello_. Before the month was over _Epipsychidion_ had been written.\r\n\r\nBefore the middle of January he could write of her--\r\n\r\n    My conception of Emilia's talents augments every day. Her moral nature\r\n    is fine, but not above circumstances; yet I think her tender and true,\r\n    which is always something. How many are only one of these things at a\r\n    time!...\r\n\r\n    There is no reason that you should fear any admixture of that which\r\n    you call _love_....\r\n\r\nThis was written to Clare. She had very quickly become intimate and\r\nconfidential with Emilia, and estimated her to a nicety at her real worth,\r\nadmiring her without idealising her or caring to do so. She knew Shelley\r\npretty intimately too, and, being personally unconcerned in the matter,\r\ncould afford at once to be sympathetic and to speak her mind fearlessly;\r\nthe consequence being that Shelley was unconstrained in communication with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThat _Mary_ should be his most sympathetic confidant at this juncture was\r\nnot in the nature of things. She, too, had begun by idealising Emilia,\r\nbut her affection and enthusiastic admiration were soon outdone and might\r\nwell have been quenched by Shelley's rapt devotion. She did not\r\nmisunderstand him, she knew him too well for that, but the better she\r\nunderstood him the less it was possible for her to feel with him; nor\r\ncould it have been otherwise unless she had been really as cold as she\r\nsometimes appeared. Loyal herself, she never doubted Shelley's loyalty,\r\nbut she suffered, though she did not choose to show it: her love, like a\r\nwoman's,--perhaps even more than most women's--was exclusive; Shelley's,\r\nlike a man's,--like many of the best of men's,--inclusive.\r\n\r\nShe did not allow her feelings to interfere with her actions. She\r\ncontinued to show all possible sympathy and kindness to Emilia, who in\r\nreturn would style her her dearest, loveliest friend and sister. No\r\nwonder, however, if at times Mary could not quite overcome a slight\r\nconstraint of manner, or if this was increased when her dearest sister,\r\nwith sweet unconsciousness, would openly probe the wound her pride would\r\nfain have hidden from herself; when Emilia, for instance, wrote to\r\nShelley--\r\n\r\n    Mary does not write to me. Is it possible that she loves me less than\r\n    the others do? I should indeed be inconsolable at that.\r\n\r\nOr to be informed in a letter to herself that this constraint of manner\r\nhad been talked over by Emilia with Shelley, who had assured her that\r\nMary's apparent coldness was only \"the ash which covered an affectionate\r\nheart.\"\r\n\r\nHe was right, indeed, and his words were the faithful echo of his own true\r\nheart. He might have added, of himself, that his transient enthusiasms\r\nresembled the soaring blaze of sparks struck by a hammer from a glowing\r\nmass of molten metal.\r\n\r\nBut, in everyday prose, the situation was a trying one for Mary, and\r\nsurely no wife of two and twenty could have met it more bravely and simply\r\nthan she did.\r\n\r\n    \"It is grievous,\" she wrote to Leigh Hunt, \"to see this beautiful girl\r\n    wearing out the best years of her life in an odious convent, where\r\n    both mind and body are sick from want of the appropriate exercise for\r\n    each. I think she has great talent, if not genius; or if not an\r\n    internal fountain, how could she have acquired the mastery she has of\r\n    her own language, which she writes so beautifully, or those ideas\r\n    which lift her so far above the rest of the Italians? She has not\r\n    studied much, and now, hopeless from a five years' confinement,\r\n    everything disgusts her, and she looks with hatred and distaste even\r\n    on the alleviations of her situation. Her only hope is in a marriage\r\n    which her parents tell her is concluded, although she has never seen\r\n    the person intended for her. Nor do I think the change of situation\r\n    will be much for the better, for he is a younger brother, and will\r\n    live in the house with his mother, who they say is _molto seccante_.\r\n    Yet she may then have the free use of her limbs; she may then be able\r\n    to walk out among the fields, vineyards, and woods of her country,\r\n    and see the mountains and the sky, and not as now, a dozen steps to\r\n    the right, and then back to the left another dozen, which is the\r\n    longest walk her convent garden affords, and that, you may be sure,\r\n    she is very seldom tempted to take.\"\r\n\r\nBy the middle of February Shelley was sending his poem for publication,\r\nspeaking of it as the production of \"a part of himself already dead.\" He\r\ncontinued, however, to take an almost painful interest in Emilia's fate;\r\nshe, poor girl, though not the sublime creature he had thought her, was\r\ninfinitely to be pitied. Before their acquaintance ended, she was turning\r\nit to practical account, after the fashion of most of Shelley's friends,\r\nby begging for and obtaining considerable sums of money.\r\n\r\nIf Mary then indulged in a little retrospective sarcasm to her friend,\r\nMrs. Gisborne, it is hardly wonderful. Indeed, later allusions are not\r\nwanting to show that this time was felt by her to be one of annoyance and\r\nbitterness.\r\n\r\nTwo circumstances were in her favour. She was well, and, therefore,\r\nphysically able to look at things in their true light; and, during a great\r\npart of the time, Clare was away. In the previous October, during their\r\nstay at the Baths, she had at last resolved on trying to make out some\r\nsort of life for herself, and had taken a situation as governess in a\r\nFlorentine family. She had come back to the Shelleys for the month of\r\nDecember (when it was that she became acquainted with Emilia Vivani), but\r\nhad returned to Florence at Christmas.\r\n\r\nShe had been persuaded to this step by the judicious Mrs. Mason, who had\r\nsoon perceived the strained relations existing between Mary and Clare, and\r\nhad seen, too, that the disunion was only the natural and inevitable\r\nresult of circumstances. It was not only that the two girls were of\r\nopposite and jarring temperament; there was also the fact that half the\r\nsuspicious mistrust with Shelley was regarded by those who did not\r\npersonally know him, and the shadow of which rested on Mary too, was\r\ncaused by Clare's continued presence among them. As things were now, it\r\nmight have passed without remark, but for the scandalous reports which\r\ndated back to the Marlow days, and which had recently been revived by the\r\nslanders of Paolo, although the extent of these slanders had not yet\r\ntranspired. Shelley had been alive enough to the danger at one time, but\r\nhad now got accustomed and indifferent to it. He had a great affection and\r\na great compassion for Clare; her vivacity enlivened him; he said himself\r\nthat he liked her although she teased him, and he certainly missed her\r\nteasing when she was away. But Mary, to whom Clare's perpetual society was\r\nneither a solace nor a change, and who, as the mother of children, could\r\nno longer look at things from a purely egotistic point of view, must have\r\nfelt it positively unjust and wrong to allow their father's reputation to\r\nbe sacrificed--to say nothing of her own--to what was in no wise a\r\nnecessity. Shelley loved solitude--a mitigated solitude that is;--he\r\ncertainly did not pine for general society. Yet many of his letters bear\r\nunmistakable evidence to the pain and resentment he felt at being\r\nuniversally shunned by his own countrymen, as if he were an enemy of the\r\nhuman race. But Mary, a woman, and only twenty-two, must have been\r\nself-sufficient indeed if, with all her mental resources, she had not\r\nrequired the renovation of change and contrast and varied intercourse, to\r\nkeep her mind and spirit fresh and bright, and to fit her for being a\r\ncompanion and a resource to Shelley. That she and he were condemned to\r\nprotracted isolation was partly due to Clare, and when Mary was weak and\r\ndejected, her consciousness of this became painful, and her feeling\r\ntowards the sprightly, restless Miss Clairmont was touched with positive\r\nantipathy. Shelley, considering Clare the weaker party, supported her, in\r\nthe main, and certainly showed no desire to have her away. He might have\r\nseen that to impose her presence on Mary in such circumstances was, in\r\nfact, as great a piece of tyranny as he had suffered from when Eliza\r\nWestbrook was imposed on him. But of this he was, and he remained,\r\nperfectly unconscious. Clare ought to have retired from the field, but her\r\ndependent condition, and her wretched anxiety about Allegra, were her\r\nexcuse for clinging to the only friends she had.\r\n\r\nAll this was evident to Mrs. Mason, and it was soon shown that she had\r\njudged rightly, as the relations between Mary and Clare became cordial and\r\nnatural once they were relieved from the intolerable friction of daily\r\ncompanionship.\r\n\r\nDuring this time of excitement and unrest one new acquaintance had,\r\nhowever, begun, which circumstances were to develop into a close and\r\nintimate companionship.\r\n\r\nIn January there had arrived at Pisa a young couple of the name of\r\nWilliams; mainly attracted by the desire to see and to know Shelley, of\r\nwhose gifts and virtues and sufferings they had heard much from Tom\r\nMedwin, their neighbour in Switzerland the year before. Lieutenant Edward\r\nElliker Williams had been, first, in the Navy, then in the Army; had met\r\nhis wife in India, and, returning with her to England, had sold his\r\ncommission and retired on half-pay. He was young, of a frank\r\nstraightforward disposition and most amiable temper, modest and\r\nunpretentious, with some literary taste, and no strong prejudices. Jane\r\nWilliams was young and pretty, gentle and graceful, neither very\r\ncultivated nor particularly clever, but with a comfortable absence of\r\nangles in her disposition, and an abundance of that feminine tact which\r\nprevents intellectual shortcomings from being painfully felt, and which\r\nis, in its way, a manifestation of genius. Not an uncommon type of woman,\r\nbut quite new in the Shelleys' experience. At first they thought her\r\nrather wanting in animation, and Shelley was conscious of her lack of\r\nliterary refinement, but these were more and more compensated for, as time\r\nwent on, by her natural grace and her taste for music. \"Ned\" was something\r\nof an artist, and Mary Shelley sat more than once to him for her portrait.\r\nThere was, in short, no lack of subjects in common, and the two young\r\ncouples found a mutual pleasure in each other's society which increased in\r\nmeasure as they became better acquainted.\r\n\r\nIn March poor Clare received with bitter grief the intelligence that her\r\nchild had been placed by Byron in a convent, at Bagnacavallo, not far from\r\nRavenna, where he now lived. Under the sway of the Countess Guiccioli,\r\nwhose father and brother were domesticated in his house, he was leading\r\nwhat, in comparison with his Venetian existence, was a life of\r\nrespectability and virtue. His action with regard to Allegra was\r\nconsidered by the Shelleys as, probably, inevitable in the circumstances,\r\nbut to Clare it was a terrible blow. She felt more hopelessly separated\r\nfrom her child than ever, and she had seen enough of Italian convent\r\neducation and its results to convince her that it meant moral and\r\nintellectual degradation and death. Her despairing representations to this\r\neffect were, of course, unanswered by Byron, who contented himself with a\r\nMephistophelian sneer in showing her letter to the Hoppners.\r\n\r\nWith the true \"malignity of those who turn sweet food into poison,\r\ntransforming all they touch to the malignity of their own natures,\"[39] he\r\nhad no hesitation in giving credit to the reports about Clare's life in\r\nthe Shelleys' family, nor in openly implying his own belief in their\r\nprobable truth.\r\n\r\nBut for this, and for one great alarm caused by the sudden and\r\nunaccountable stoppage of Shelley's income (through a mistake which\r\nhappily was discovered and speedily rectified by his good friend, Horace\r\nSmith), the spring was, for Mary, peaceful and bright. She was assiduous\r\nin her Greek studies, and keenly interested in the contemporary European\r\npolitics of that stirring time; as full of sympathy as Shelley himself\r\ncould be with the numerous insurrectionary outbreaks in favour of liberty.\r\nAnd when the revolution in Greece broke out, and one bright April morning\r\nPrince Mavrocordato rushed in to announce to her the proclamation of\r\nPrince Hypsilantes, her elation and joy almost equalled his own.\r\n\r\nIn companionship with the Williams', aided and abetted by Henry Reveley,\r\nShelley's old passion for boating revived. In the little ten-foot long\r\nboat procured for him for a few pauls, and then fitted up by Mr. Reveley,\r\nthey performed many a voyage, on the Arno, on the canal between Pisa and\r\nLeghorn, and even on the sea. Their first trip was marked by an\r\naccident--Williams contriving to overturn the boat. Nothing daunted,\r\nShelley declared next day that his ducking had added fire to, instead of\r\nquenching, the nautical ardour which produced it, and that he considered\r\nit a good omen to any enterprise that it began in evil, as making it more\r\nlikely that it would end in good.\r\n\r\nAll these events are touched on in the few specimen extracts from Mary's\r\njournal and letters which follow--\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, January 31._--Read Greek.

The Morea free.\r\n\r\nThey now migrated once more to the beautiful neighbourhood of the Baths of\r\nSan Giuliano di Pisa; the Williams' established themselves at Pugnano,\r\nonly four miles off: the canal fed by the Serchio ran between the two\r\nplaces, and the little boat was in constant requisition.\r\n\r\n      Our boat is asleep on Serchio's stream,\r\n      Its sails are folded like thoughts in a dream,\r\n      The helm sways idly, hither and thither;\r\n      Dominic, the boatman, has brought the mast,\r\n      And the oars, and the sails; but 'tis sleeping fast,\r\n      Like a beast, unconscious of its tether.[41]\r\n\r\n    The canal which, fed by the Serchio, was, though an artificial, a full\r\n    and picturesque stream, making its way under verdant banks, sheltered\r\n    by trees that dipped their boughs into the murmuring waters. By day,\r\n    multitudes of ephemera darted to and fro on the surface; at night, the\r\n    fireflies came out among the shrubs on the banks; the _cicale_, at\r\n    noonday, kept up their hum; the aziola cooed in the quiet evening. It\r\n    was a pleasant summer, bright in all but Shelley's health and\r\n    inconstant spirits; yet he enjoyed himself greatly, and became more\r\n    and more attached to the part of the country where chance appeared to\r\n    cast us. Sometimes he projected taking a farm, situated on the height\r\n    of one of the near hills, surrounded by chestnut and pine woods and\r\n    overlooking a wide extent of country; or of settling still further in\r\n    the maritime Apennines, at Massa. Several of his slighter and\r\n    unfinished poems were inspired by these scenes, and by the companions\r\n    around us. It is the nature of that poetry, however, which overflows\r\n    from the soul, oftener to express sorrow and regret than joy; for it\r\n    is when oppressed by the weight of life and away from those he loves,\r\n    that the poet has recourse to the solace of expression in verse.[42]\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Journal, Thursday, May 3._--Read Villani. Go out in boat; call on\r\n    Emilia Viviani. Walk with Shelley. In the evening Alex. Mavrocordato,\r\n    Henry Reveley, Dancelli, and Mr. Taafe.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, May 4._--Read Greek. (Alex. M.)

Fireflies in the\r\n    evening.\r\n\r\nThey were near enough to Pisa to go over there from time to time to see\r\nEmilia and other friends, and for Prince Mavrocordato to come frequently\r\nand give them the latest political news: the Greek lessons had been\r\nvoluntarily abjured by Mary when it seemed probable that the Prince might\r\nbe summoned at any moment to play an active part in the affairs of his\r\ncountry, as actually happened in June. Shelley was still tormented by the\r\npain in his side, but his health and spirits were insensibly improving, as\r\nhe himself afterwards admitted. He was occupied in writing _Hellas_; his\r\nelegy on Keats's death, _Adonais_ also belongs to this time. Ned Williams,\r\ninfected by the surrounding atmosphere of literature, had tried his\r\n'prentice hand on a drama. In the words of his own journal--\r\n\r\n    Went in the summer to Pugnano--passed the first three months in\r\n    writing a play entitled _The Promise, or a year, a month, and a day_.\r\n    S. tells me if they accept it he has great hopes of its success before\r\n    an audience, and his hopes always enliven mine.\r\n\r\nMary was straining every nerve to finish _Valperga_, in the hope of being\r\nable to send it to England by the Gisbornes, who were preparing to leave\r\nItaly,--a hope, however, which was not fulfilled.\r\n\r\n    MARY TO MRS. GISBORNE.\r\n\r\n    BATHS OF S. GIULIANO,\r\n    _30th June 1821_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MRS. GISBORNE--Well, how do you get on? Mr. Gisborne says\r\n    nothing of that in the note which he wrote yesterday, and it is that\r\n    in which I am most interested.\r\n\r\n    I pity you exceedingly in all the disagreeable details to which you\r\n    are obliged to sacrifice your time and attention. I can conceive no\r\n    employment more tedious; but now I hope it is nearly over, and that as\r\n    the fruit of its conclusion you will soon come to see us. Shelley is\r\n    far from well; he suffers from his side and nervous irritation. The\r\n    day on which he returned from Leghorn he found little Percy ill of a\r\n    fever produced by teething. He got well the next day, but it was so\r\n    strong while it lasted that it frightened us greatly. You know how\r\n    much reason we have to fear the deceitful appearance of perfect\r\n    health. You see that this, your last summer in Italy, is manufactured\r\n    on purpose to accustom you to the English seasons.\r\n\r\n    It is warmer now, but we still enjoy the delight of cloudy skies. The\r\n    \"Creator\" has not yet made himself heard. I get on with my occupation,\r\n    and hope to finish the rough transcript this month. I shall then give\r\n    about a month to corrections, and then I shall transcribe it. It has\r\n    indeed been a child of mighty slow growth since I first thought of it\r\n    in our library at Marlow. I then wanted the body in which I might\r\n    embody my spirit. The materials for this I found at Naples, but I\r\n    wanted other books. Nor did I begin it till a year afterwards at Pisa;\r\n    it was again suspended during our stay at your house, and continued\r\n    again at the Baths. All the winter I did not touch it, but now it is\r\n    in a state of great forwardness, since I am at page 71 of the third\r\n    volume. It has indeed been a work of some labour, since I have read\r\n    and consulted a great many books. I shall be very glad to read the\r\n    first volume to you, that you may give me your opinion as to the\r\n    conduct and interest of the story. June is now at its last gasp. You\r\n    talked of going in August, I hope therefore that we may soon expect\r\n    you. Have you heard anything concerning the inhabitants of Skinner\r\n    Street? It is now many months since I received a letter, and I begin\r\n    to grow alarmed. Adieu.--Ever sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n      MARY W. S.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of July the Gisbornes came to pay their friends a short\r\nfarewell visit; on the 29th they started for England; Shelley going with\r\nthem as far as Florence, where he and Mary thought again of settling for\r\nthe winter, and where he wished to make inquiries about houses. During his\r\nfew days' absence the Williams' were almost constantly with Mary. Edward\r\nWilliams was busy painting a portrait of her in miniature, intended by\r\nher as a surprise for Shelley on his birthday, the 4th of August. But when\r\nthat day arrived Shelley was unavoidably absent. On his return to the\r\nBaths he had found a letter from Lord Byron, with a pressing invitation to\r\nvisit him at Ravenna, whence Byron was on the point of departing to join\r\nCountess Guiccioli and her family, who had been exiled from the Roman\r\nStates for Carbonarism, and who, for the present, had taken refuge at\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\nShelley's thoughts turned at once, as they could not but do, to poor\r\nlittle Allegra, in her convent of Bagnacavallo. What was to become of her?\r\nWhere would or could she be sent? or was she to be conveniently forgotten\r\nand left behind? He was off next day, the 3d; paid a flying visit to\r\nClare, who was staying for her health at Leghorn, and arrived at Ravenna\r\non the 6th.\r\n\r\nThe miniature was finished and ready for him on his birthday. Mary, alone\r\non that anniversary, was fain to look back over the past eventful seven\r\nyears,--their joys, their sorrows, their many changes. Not long before,\r\nshe had said, in a letter to Clare, \"One is not gay, at least I am not,\r\nbut peaceful, and at peace with all the world.\" The same tone\r\ncharacterises the entry in her journal for 4th August.\r\n\r\n    Shelley's birthday. Seven years are now gone; what changes! what a\r\n    life! We now appear tranquil, yet who knows what wind----but I will\r\n    not prognosticate evil; we have had enough of it. When Shelley came to\r\n    Italy I said, all is well, if it were permanent; it was more passing\r\n    than an Italian twilight. I now say the same. May it be a Polar day,\r\n    yet that, too, has an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nAUGUST-NOVEMBER 1821\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Bologna Shelley wrote to Mary an amusing account of his journey, so\r\nfar. But this letter was speedily followed by another, written within a\r\nfew hours of his arrival at Ravenna; a letter, this second one, to make\r\nMary's blood run cold, although it is expressed with all the calmness and\r\ntemperance that Shelley could command.\r\n\r\n    RAVENNA, _7th August 1821_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST MARY--I arrived last night at 10 o'clock, and sate up\r\n    talking with Lord Byron until 5 this morning. I then went to sleep,\r\n    and now awake at 11, and having despatched my breakfast as quick as\r\n    possible, mean to devote the interval until 12, when the post departs,\r\n    to you.\r\n\r\n    Lord Byron is very well, and was delighted to see me. He has, in fact,\r\n    completely recovered his health, and lives a life totally the reverse\r\n    of that which he led at Venice. He has a permanent sort of _liaison_\r\n    with Contessa Guiccioli, who is now at Florence, and seems from her\r\n    letters to be a very amiable woman. She is waiting there until\r\n    something shall be decided as to their emigration to Switzerland or\r\n    stay in Italy, which is yet undetermined on either side. She was\r\n    compelled to escape from the Papal territory in great haste, as\r\n    measures had already been taken to place her in a convent, where she\r\n    would have been unrelentingly confined for life. The oppression of the\r\n    marriage contract, as existing in the laws and opinions of Italy,\r\n    though less frequently exercised, is far severer than that of England.\r\n    I tremble to think of what poor Emilia is destined to.\r\n\r\n    Lord Byron had almost destroyed himself in Venice; his state of\r\n    debility was such that he was unable to digest any food; he was\r\n    consumed by hectic fever, and would speedily have perished, but for\r\n    this attachment, which has reclaimed him from the excesses into which\r\n    he threw himself, from carelessness rather than taste. Poor fellow! he\r\n    is now quite well, and immersed in politics and literature. He has\r\n    given me a number of the most interesting details on the former\r\n    subject, but we will not speak of them in a letter. Fletcher is here,\r\n    and as if, like a shadow, he waxed and waned with the substance of his\r\n    master, Fletcher also has recovered his good looks, and from amidst\r\n    the unseasonable gray hairs a fresh harvest of flaxen locks has put\r\n    forth.\r\n\r\n    We talked a great deal of poetry and such matters last night, and, as\r\n    usual, differed, and I think more than ever. He affects to patronise a\r\n    system of criticism fit for the production of mediocrity, and,\r\n    although all his fine poems and passages have been produced in\r\n    defiance of this system, yet I recognise the pernicious effects of it\r\n    in the _Doge of Venice_, and it will cramp and limit his future\r\n    efforts, however great they may be, unless he gets rid of it. I have\r\n    read only parts of it, or rather, he himself read them to me, and gave\r\n    me the plan of the whole.\r\n\r\n    Allegra, he says, is grown very beautiful, but he complains that her\r\n    temper is violent and imperious. He has no intention of leaving her in\r\n    Italy; indeed, the thing is too improper in itself not to carry\r\n    condemnation along with it. Contessa Guiccioli, he says, is very fond\r\n    of her; indeed, I cannot see why she should not take care of it, if\r\n    she is to live as his ostensible mistress. All this I shall know more\r\n    of soon.\r\n\r\n    Lord Byron has also told me of a circumstance that shocks me\r\n    exceedingly, because it exhibits a degree of desperate and wicked\r\n    malice, for which I am at a loss to account. When I hear such things\r\n    my patience and my philosophy are put to a severe proof, whilst I\r\n    refrain from seeking out some obscure hiding-place, where the\r\n    countenance of man may never meet me more. It seems that _Elise_,\r\n    actuated either by some inconceivable malice for our dismissing her,\r\n    or bribed by my enemies, has persuaded the Hoppners of a story so\r\n    monstrous and incredible that they must have been prone to believe any\r\n    evil to have believed such assertions upon such evidence. Mr. Hoppner\r\n    wrote to Lord Byron to state this story as the reason why he declined\r\n    any further communications with us, and why he advised him to do the\r\n    same. Elise says that Claire was my mistress; that is very well, and\r\n    so far there is nothing new; all the world has heard so much, and\r\n    people may believe or not believe as they think good. She then\r\n    proceeds further to say that Claire was with child by me; that I gave\r\n    her the most violent medicine to procure abortion; that this not\r\n    succeeding she was brought to bed, and that I immediately tore the\r\n    child from her and sent it to the Foundling Hospital,--I quote Mr.\r\n    Hoppner's words,--and this is stated to have taken place in the winter\r\n    after we left Este. In addition, she says that both Claire and I\r\n    treated you in the most shameful manner; that I neglected and beat\r\n    you, and that Claire never let a day pass without offering you insults\r\n    of the most violent kind, in which she was abetted by me.\r\n\r\n    As to what Reviews and the world say, I do not care a jot, but when\r\n    persons who have known me are capable of conceiving of me--not that I\r\n    have fallen into a great error, as would have been the living with\r\n    Claire as my mistress--but that I have committed such unutterable\r\n    crimes as destroying or abandoning a child, and that my own! Imagine\r\n    my despair of good! Imagine how it is possible that one of so weak and\r\n    sensitive a nature as mine can run further the gauntlet through this\r\n    hellish society of men! _You_ should write to the Hoppners a letter\r\n    refuting the charge, in case you believe and know, and can prove that\r\n    it is false, stating the grounds and proof of your belief. I need not\r\n    dictate what you should say, nor, I hope, inspire you with warmth to\r\n    rebut a charge which you only can effectually rebut. If you will send\r\n    the letter to me here, I will forward it to the Hoppners. Lord Byron\r\n    is not up. I do not know the Hoppners' address, and I am anxious not\r\n    to lose a post.\r\n\r\n      P. B. S.\r\n\r\nMary's feelings on the perusal of this letter may be faintly imagined by\r\nthose who read it now, and who know what manner of woman she actually was.\r\nThey are expressed, as far as they could be expressed, in the letter\r\nwhich, in accordance with Shelley's desire, and while still smarting under\r\nthe first shock of grief and profound indignation, she wrote off to Mrs.\r\nHoppner, and enclosed in a note to Shelley himself.\r\n\r\n    MARY TO SHELLEY.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SHELLEY--Shocked beyond all measure as I was, I instantly\r\n    wrote the enclosed. If the task be not too dreadful, pray copy it for\r\n    me; I cannot.\r\n\r\n    Read that part of your letter that contains the accusation. I tried,\r\n    but I could not write it. I think I could as soon have died. I send\r\n    also Elise's last letter: enclose it or not, as you think best.\r\n\r\n    I wrote to you with far different feelings last night, beloved friend,\r\n    our barque is indeed \"tempest tost,\" but love me as you have ever\r\n    done, and God preserve my child to me, and our enemies shall not be\r\n    too much for us. Consider well if Florence be a fit residence for us.\r\n    I love, I own, to face danger, but I would not be imprudent.\r\n\r\n    Pray get my letter to Mrs. Hoppner copied for a thousand reasons.\r\n    Adieu, dearest! Take care of yourself--all yet is well. The shock for\r\n    me is over, and I now despise the slander; but it must not pass\r\n    uncontradicted. I sincerely thank Lord Byron for his kind\r\n    unbelief.--Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n      M. W. S.\r\n\r\n    Do not think me imprudent in mentioning E.'s[44] illness at Naples. It\r\n    is well to meet facts. They are as cunning as wicked. I have read over\r\n    my letter; it is written in haste, but it were as well that the first\r\n    burst of feeling should be expressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PISA, _10th August 1821_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MRS. HOPPNER--After a silence of nearly two years I address\r\n    you again, and most bitterly do I regret the occasion on which I now\r\n    write. Pardon me that I do not write in French; you understand English\r\n    well, and I am too much impressed to shackle myself in a foreign\r\n    language; even in my own my thoughts far outrun my pen, so that I can\r\n    hardly form the letters. I write to defend him to whom I have the\r\n    happiness to be united, whom I love and esteem beyond all living\r\n    creatures, from the foulest calumnies; and to you I write this, who\r\n    were so kind, and to Mr. Hoppner, to both of whom I indulged the\r\n    pleasing idea that I have every reason to feel gratitude. This is\r\n    indeed a painful task. Shelley is at present on a visit to Lord Byron\r\n    at Ravenna, and I received a letter from him to-day, containing\r\n    accounts that make my hand tremble so much that I can hardly hold the\r\n    pen. It tells me that Elise wrote to you, relating the most hideous\r\n    stories against him, and that you have believed them. Before I speak\r\n    of these falsehoods, permit me to say a few words concerning this\r\n    miserable girl. You well know that she formed an attachment with Paolo\r\n    when we proceeded to Rome, and at Naples their marriage was talked of.\r\n    We all tried to dissuade her; we knew Paolo to be a rascal, and we\r\n    thought so well of her. An accident led me to the knowledge that\r\n    without marrying they had formed a connection. She was ill; we sent\r\n    for a doctor, who said there was danger of a miscarriage, I would not\r\n    throw the girl on the world without in some degree binding her to this\r\n    man. We had them married at Sir R. A. Court's. She left us, turned\r\n    Catholic at Rome, married him, and then went to Florence. After the\r\n    disastrous death of my child we came to Tuscany. We have seen little\r\n    of them, but we have had knowledge that Paolo has formed a scheme of\r\n    extorting money from Shelley by false accusations. He has written him\r\n    threatening letters, saying that he would be the ruin of him, etc. We\r\n    placed them in the hands of a celebrated lawyer here, who has done\r\n    what he can to silence him. Elise has never interfered in this, and\r\n    indeed the other day I received a letter from her, entreating, with\r\n    great professions of love, that I would send her money. I took no\r\n    notice of this, but although I know her to be in evil hands, I would\r\n    not believe that she was wicked enough to join in his plans without\r\n    proof. And now I come to her accusations, and I must indeed summon all\r\n    my courage whilst I transcribe them, for tears will force their way,\r\n    and how can it be otherwise?\r\n\r\n    You know Shelley, you saw his face, and could you believe them?\r\n    Believe them only on the testimony of a girl whom you despised? I had\r\n    hoped that such a thing was impossible, and that although strangers\r\n    might believe the calumnies that this man propagated, none who had\r\n    ever seen my husband could for a moment credit them.\r\n\r\n    He says Claire was Shelley's mistress, that--upon my word I solemnly\r\n    assure you that I cannot write the words. I send you a part of\r\n    Shelley's letter that you may see what I am now about to refute, but I\r\n    had rather die than copy anything so vilely, so wickedly false, so\r\n    beyond all imagination fiendish.\r\n\r\n    But that you should believe it! That my beloved Shelley should stand\r\n    thus slandered in your minds--he, the gentlest and most humane of\r\n    creatures--is more painful to me, oh! far more painful than words can\r\n    express. Need I say that the union between my husband and myself has\r\n    ever been undisturbed? Love caused our first imprudence--love, which,\r\n    improved by esteem, a perfect trust one in the other, a confidence and\r\n    affection which, visited as we have been by severe calamities (have we\r\n    not lost two children?), has increased daily and knows no bounds. I\r\n    will add that Claire has been separated from us for about a year. She\r\n    lives with a respectable German family at Florence. The reasons for\r\n    this were obvious: her connection with us made her manifest as the\r\n    Miss Clairmont, the mother of Allegra; besides we live much alone, she\r\n    enters much into society there, and, solely occupied with the idea of\r\n    the welfare of her child, she wished to appear such that she may not\r\n    be thought in after times to be unworthy of fulfilling the maternal\r\n    duties. You ought to have paused before you tried to convince the\r\n    father of her child of such unheard-of atrocities on her part. If his\r\n    generosity and knowledge of the world had not made him reject the\r\n    slander with the ridicule it deserved, what irretrievable mischief you\r\n    would have occasioned her. Those who know me well believe my simple\r\n    word--it is not long ago that my father said in a letter to me that he\r\n    had never known me utter a falsehood,--but you, easy as you have been\r\n    to credit evil, who may be more deaf to truth--to you I swear by all\r\n    that I hold sacred upon heaven and earth, by a vow which I should die\r\n    to write if I affirmed a falsehood,--I swear by the life of my child,\r\n    by my blessed, beloved child, that I know the accusations to be false.\r\n    But I have said enough to convince you, and are you not convinced? Are\r\n    not my words the words of truth? Repair, I conjure you, the evil you\r\n    have done by retracting your confidence in one so vile as Elise, and\r\n    by writing to me that you now reject as false every circumstance of\r\n    her infamous tale.\r\n\r\n    You were kind to us, and I will never forget it; now I require\r\n    justice. You must believe me, and do me, I solemnly entreat you, the\r\n    justice to confess you do so.\r\n\r\n      MARY W. SHELLEY.\r\n\r\n    I send this letter to Shelley at Ravenna, that he may see it, for\r\n    although I ought, the subject is too odious to me to copy it. I wish\r\n    also that Lord Byron should see it; he gave no credit to the tale, but\r\n    it is as well that he should see how entirely fabulous it is.\r\n\r\nShelley, meanwhile, never far from her in thought, and knowing only too\r\nwell how acutely she would suffer from all this, was writing to her\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n    SHELLEY TO MARY.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST MARY--I wrote to you yesterday, and I begin another letter\r\n    to-day without knowing exactly when I can send it, as I am told the\r\n    post only goes once a week. I daresay the subject of the latter half\r\n    of my letter gave you pain, but it was necessary to look the affair in\r\n    the face, and the only satisfactory answer to the calumny must be\r\n    given by you, and could be given by you alone. This is evidently the\r\n    source of the violent denunciations of the _Literary Gazette_, in\r\n    themselves contemptible enough, and only to be regarded as effects\r\n    which show us their cause, which, until we put off our mortal nature,\r\n    we never despise--that is, the belief of persons who have known and\r\n    seen you that you are guilty of crimes. A certain degree and a certain\r\n    kind of infamy is to be borne, and, in fact, is the best compliment\r\n    which an exalted nature can receive from a filthy world, of which it\r\n    is its hell to be a part, but this sort of thing exceeds the measure,\r\n    and even if it were only for the sake of our dear Percy, I would take\r\n    some pains to suppress it. In fact it shall be suppressed, even if I\r\n    am driven to the disagreeable necessity of prosecuting him before the\r\n    Tuscan tribunals....\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Write to me at Florence, where I shall remain a day at least, and send\r\n    me letters, or news of letters. How is my little darling? and how are\r\n    you, and how do you get on with your book? Be severe in your\r\n    corrections, and expect severity from me, your sincere admirer. I\r\n    flatter myself you have composed something unequalled in its kind, and\r\n    that, not content with the honours of your birth and your hereditary\r\n    aristocracy, you will add still higher renown to your name. Expect me\r\n    at the end of my appointed time. I do not think I shall be detained.\r\n    Is Claire with you? or is she coming? Have you heard anything of my\r\n    poor Emilia, from whom I got a letter the day of my departure, saying\r\n    that her marriage was deferred for a very short time, on account of\r\n    the illness of her Sposo? How are the Williams', and Williams\r\n    especially? Give my very kindest love to them.\r\n\r\n    Lord Byron has here splendid apartments in the house of his mistress's\r\n    husband, who is one of the richest men in Italy. _She_ is divorced,\r\n    with an allowance of 1200 crowns a year--a miserable pittance from a\r\n    man who has 120,000 a year. Here are two monkeys, five cats, eight\r\n    dogs, and ten horses, all of whom (except the horses) walk about the\r\n    house like the masters of it. Tita, the Venetian, is here, and\r\n    operates as my valet; a fine fellow, with a prodigious black beard,\r\n    and who has stabbed two or three people, and is one of the most\r\n    good-natured-looking fellows I ever saw.\r\n\r\n    We have good rumours of the Greeks here, and a Russian war. I hardly\r\n    wish the Russians to take any part in it. My maxim is with Aeschylus:\r\n    [Greek: to dyssebes--meta men pleiona tiktei, sphetera d'eikota\r\n    genna].\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    There is a Greek exercise for you. How should slaves produce anything\r\n    but tyranny, even as the seed produces the plant? Adieu, dear\r\n    Mary.--Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n      S.\r\n\r\nAt Ravenna there was only a weekly post. Shelley had to wait a long time\r\nfor Mary's answer, and before it could reach him he was writing to her yet\r\na third time. His mind was now full of Allegra. She was not to be left\r\nalone in Italy. Shelley, enlightened by Emilia Viviani, had been able to\r\ngive Byron, on the subject of convents, such information as to \"shake his\r\nfaith in the purity of these receptacles.\" But no conclusions of any sort\r\nhad been arrived at as to her future; and Shelley entreated Mary to rack\r\nher brains, to inquire of all her friends, to leave no stone unturned, if\r\nby any possibility she could find some fitting asylum, some safe home for\r\nthe lovely child. He had been to see the little girl at her convent, and\r\nall readers of his letters know the description of the fairy creature,\r\nwho, with her \"contemplative seriousness, mixed with excessive vivacity,\r\nseemed a thing of a higher and a finer order\" than the children around\r\nher; happy and well cared for, as far as he could judge; pale, but\r\nlovelier and livelier than ever, and full of childish glee and fun.\r\n\r\nAt this point of his letter Mary's budget arrived, and Shelley continued\r\nas follows--\r\n\r\n    RAVENNA, _Thursday_.\r\n\r\n    I have received your letter with that to Mrs. Hoppner. I do not\r\n    wonder, my dearest friend, that you should have been moved. I was at\r\n    first, but speedily regained the indifference which the opinion of\r\n    anything or anybody, except our own consciousness, amply merits, and\r\n    day by day shall more receive from me. I have not recopied your\r\n    letter, such a measure would destroy its authenticity, but have given\r\n    it to Lord Byron, who has engaged to send it with his own comments to\r\n    the Hoppners. People do not hesitate, it seems, to make themselves\r\n    panders and accomplices to slander, for the Hoppners had exacted from\r\n    Lord Byron that these accusations should be concealed from _me_: Lord\r\n    Byron is not a man to keep a secret, good or bad, but in openly\r\n    confessing that he has not done so he must observe a certain delicacy,\r\n    and therefore wished to send the letter himself, and, indeed, this\r\n    adds weight to your representations. Have you seen the article in the\r\n    _Literary Gazette_ on me? They evidently allude to some story of this\r\n    kind. However cautious the Hoppners have been in preventing the\r\n    calumniated person from asserting his justification, you know too much\r\n    of the world not to be certain that this was the utmost limit of their\r\n    caution. So much for nothing.\r\n\r\n    Lord Byron is immediately coming to Pisa. He will set off the moment I\r\n    can get him a house. Who would have imagined this?... What think you\r\n    of remaining at Pisa? The Williams' would probably be induced to stay\r\n    there if we did; Hunt would certainly stay, at least this winter, near\r\n    us, should he emigrate at all; Lord Byron and his Italian friends\r\n    would remain quietly there; and Lord Byron has certainly a very great\r\n    regard for us. The regard of such a man is worth some of the tribute\r\n    we must pay to the base passions of humanity in any intercourse with\r\n    those within their circle; he is better worth it than those on whom we\r\n    bestow it from mere custom.\r\n\r\n    The Masons are there, and, as far as solid affairs are concerned, are\r\n    my friends. I allow this is an argument for Florence. Mrs. Mason's\r\n    perversity is very annoying to me, especially as Mr. Tighe is\r\n    seriously my friend. This circumstance makes me averse from that\r\n    intimate continuation of intercourse which, once having begun, I can\r\n    no longer avoid.\r\n\r\n    At Pisa I need not distil my water, if I _can_ distil it anywhere.\r\n    Last winter I suffered less from my painful disorder than the winter I\r\n    spent in Florence. The arguments for Florence you know, and they are\r\n    very weighty; judge (_I know you like the job_) which scale is\r\n    overbalanced. My greatest content would be utterly to desert all human\r\n    society. I would retire with you and our child to a solitary island in\r\n    the sea, would build a boat, and shut upon my retreat the flood-gates\r\n    of the world. I would read no reviews and talk with no authors. If I\r\n    dared trust my imagination, it would tell me that there are one or two\r\n    chosen companions besides yourself whom I should desire. But to this I\r\n    would not listen. Where two or three are gathered together the devil\r\n    is among them, and good far more than evil impulses, love far more\r\n    than hatred, has been to me, except as you have been its object, the\r\n    source of all sorts of mischief. So on this plan I would be _alone_,\r\n    and would devote either to oblivion or to future generations the\r\n    overflowings of a mind which, timely withdrawn from the contagion,\r\n    should be kept fit for no baser object. But this it does not appear\r\n    that we shall do. The other side of the alternative (for a medium\r\n    ought not to be adopted) is to form for ourselves a society of our own\r\n    class, as much as possible, in intellect or in feelings, and to\r\n    connect ourselves with the interests of that society. Our roots never\r\n    struck so deeply as at Pisa, and the transplanted tree flourishes not.\r\n    People who lead the lives which we led until last winter are like a\r\n    family of Wahabee Arabs pitching their tent in the midst of London. We\r\n    must do one thing or the other,--for yourself, for our child, for our\r\n    existence. The calumnies, the sources of which are probably deeper\r\n    than we perceive, have ultimately for object the depriving us of the\r\n    means of security and subsistence. You will easily perceive the\r\n    gradations by which calumny proceeds to pretext, pretext to\r\n    persecution, and persecution to the ban of fire and water. It is for\r\n    this, and not because this or that fool, or the whole court of fools,\r\n    curse and rail, that calumny is worth refuting or chastising.\r\n\r\n      P. B. S.\r\n\r\n\"So much for nothing,\" indeed. When Byron made himself responsible for\r\nMary's letter, it was, probably, without any definite intention of\r\nwithholding it from those to whom it was addressed. He may well have\r\nwished to add to this glowing denial of his own insinuations some\r\npalliating personal explanation. When, in the previous March, Clare had\r\nprotested against an Italian convent education for Allegra, he had sent\r\nher letter to the Hoppners with a sneer at the \"excellent grace\" with\r\nwhich these representations came from a woman of the writer's character\r\nand present way of life. And yet he knew Shelley,--knew him as the\r\nHoppners could not do; he knew what Shelley had done for him, for Clare,\r\nand Allegra; and to how much slander and misrepresentation he had\r\nvoluntarily submitted that they might go scot-free. Byron was,--and he\r\nknew it,--the last person who should have accepted or allowed others to\r\naccept this fresh scandal without proof and without inquiry. He was\r\nashamed of the part he had played, and reluctant to confess to the\r\nHoppners that he had been wrong, and that his words, as often happened,\r\nhad been far in advance of his knowledge or his solid convictions; but his\r\nintentions were to do the best he could. And, satisfying himself with good\r\nintentions, he put off the unwelcome day until the occasion was past, and\r\ntill, finally, the friend whose honour had been entrusted to his keeping\r\nwas beyond his power to help or to harm. Shelley was dead; and how then\r\nexplain to the Hoppners why the letter had not been sent before? It was\r\n\"not worth while,\" probably, to revive the subject in order to vindicate a\r\nmere memory, nor yet to remove an unjust and cruel stigma from the\r\ncharacter of those who survived. However it may have been, one thing is\r\nundoubted. Mary Shelley never received any answer to her letter of\r\nprotest, which, after Byron's death, was found safe among his papers.\r\n\r\nOne more note Shelley sent to Mary from Ravenna on the subject of the\r\npromised portrait. It would not seem that the miniature was actually\r\ndespatched now, but as his return was so long delayed, the birthday plot\r\nhad to be divulged.\r\n\r\n    RAVENNA, _Tuesday, 15th August 1821_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST LOVE--I accept your kind present of your picture, and wish\r\n    you would get it prettily framed for me. I will wear, for your sake,\r\n    upon my heart this image which is ever present to my mind.\r\n\r\n    I have only two minutes to write; the post is just setting off. I\r\n    shall leave the place on Thursday or Friday morning. You would forgive\r\n    me for my longer stay if you knew the fighting I have had to make it\r\n    so short. I need not say where my own feelings impel me.\r\n\r\n    It still remains fixed that Lord Byron should come to Tuscany, and, if\r\n    possible, Pisa; but more of that to-morrow.--Your faithful and\r\n    affectionate\r\n\r\n      S.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing painful episode was enough to fill Mary's mind during the\r\nfortnight she was alone. It was well for her that she was within easy\r\nreach of cheerful friends, yet, even as it was, she could not altogether\r\nescape from bitter thoughts. Clare was at Leghorn, and had to be told of\r\neverything. Mary could not but think of the relief it would be to them all\r\nif she were to marry; a remote possibility to which she probably alludes\r\nin the following letter, written at this time to Miss Curran--\r\n\r\n    MARY SHELLEY TO MISS CURRAN.\r\n\r\n    SAN GIULIANO, _17th August_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MISS CURRAN--It gives me great pain to hear of your\r\n    ill-health. Will this hot summer conduce to a better state or not? I\r\n    hope anxiously, when I hear from you again, to learn that you are\r\n    better, having recovered from your weakness, and that you have no\r\n    return of your disorder. I should have answered your letter before,\r\n    but we have been in the confusion of moving. We are now settled in an\r\n    agreeable house at the Baths of San Giuliano, about four miles from\r\n    Pisa, under the shadow of mountains, and with delightful scenery\r\n    within a walk. We go on in our old manner, with no change. I have had\r\n    many changes for the worse; one might be for the better, but that is\r\n    nearly impossible. Our child is well and thriving, which is a great\r\n    comfort, and the Italian sky gives Shelley health, which is to him a\r\n    rare and substantial enjoyment. I did [not] receive the letter you\r\n    mention to have written in March, and you also have missed one of our\r\n    letters in which Shelley acknowledged the receipt of the drawings you\r\n    mention, and requested that the largest pyramid might be erected if\r\n    they could case it with white marble for L25. However, the whole had\r\n    better stand as I mentioned in my last; for, without the most rigorous\r\n    inspection, great cheating would take place, and no female could\r\n    detect them. When we visit Rome, we can do that which we wish. Many\r\n    thanks for your kindness, which has been very great. I would send you\r\n    on the books I mentioned, but we live out of the world, and I know of\r\n    no conveyance. Mr. Purniance says that he sent the life of your father\r\n    by sea to Rome, directed to you; so, doubtless, it is in the\r\n    custom-house there.\r\n\r\n    How enraged all our mighty rulers are at the quiet revolutions which\r\n    have taken place; it is said that some one said to the Grand Duke\r\n    here: \"Ma richiedono una constituzione qui?\" \"Ebene, la daro subito\"\r\n    was the reply; but he is not his own master, and Austria would take\r\n    care that that should not be the case; they say Austrian troops are\r\n    coming here, and the Tuscan ones will be sent to Germany. We take in\r\n    _Galignani_, and would send them to you if you liked. I do not know\r\n    what the expense would be, but I should think slight. If you\r\n    recommence painting, do not forget Beatrice. I wish very much for a\r\n    copy of that; you would oblige us greatly by making one. Pray let me\r\n    hear of your health. God knows when we shall be in Rome;\r\n    circumstances must direct, and they dance about like\r\n    will-o'-the-wisps, enticing and then deserting us. We must take care\r\n    not to be left in a bog. Adieu, take care of yourself. Believe in\r\n    Shelley's sincere wishes for your health, and in kind remembrances,\r\n    and in my being ever sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n      M. W. SHELLEY.\r\n\r\n    Clare desires (not remembrances, if they are not pleasant), however\r\n    she sends a proper message, and says she would be obliged to you, if\r\n    you let her have her picture, if you could find a mode of conveying\r\n    it....\r\n\r\n    Do you know we lose many letters, having spies (not Government ones)\r\n    about us in plenty; they made a desperate push to do us a desperate\r\n    mischief lately, but succeeded no further than to blacken us among the\r\n    English; so if you receive a fresh batch (or green bag) of scandal\r\n    against us, I assure you it is all a _lie_. Poor souls! we live\r\n    innocently, as you well know; if we did not, ten to one God would take\r\n    pity on us, and we should not be so unfortunate.\r\n\r\nShelley's absence, though eventful, was, after all, a short one. In about\r\na fortnight he was back again at the Bagni, and for a few weeks life was\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of September Mary records--\r\n\r\n    Picnic on the Pugnano Mountains; music in the evening. Sleep there.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, wishing to find some tolerably cool seaside place\r\nwhere they might spend the next summer, they went,--the Shelleys and\r\nClare,--on a two or three days' expedition of discovery to Spezzia, and\r\nwere enchanted with the beauty of the bay. Clare had, shortly after, to\r\nreturn to her situation at Florence, but the Shelleys decided to winter at\r\nPisa. They took a top flat in the \"Tre Palazzi di Chiesa,\" on the Lung'\r\nArno, and spent part of October in furnishing it. They took possession\r\nabout the 25th; the Williams' coming, not many days later, to occupy a\r\nlower flat in the same house. At Lord Byron's request, the Shelleys had\r\ntaken for him Casa Lanfranchi, the finest palace in the Lung' Arno, just\r\nopposite the house where they themselves were established. This close\r\njuxtaposition of abodes was likely to prove somewhat inconvenient, in case\r\nof Clare's occasional presence at Tre Palazzi. Her first visit, however,\r\nto which the following characteristic letter refers, was to the Masons at\r\nCasa Silva, and it came to an end just before Byron's arrival in Pisa.\r\nClare had been staying with the Williams' at Pugnano.\r\n\r\n    CLARE TO MARY.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MARY--I arrived last night--won't you come and see me to-day?\r\n    The Williams' wish you to forward them Mr. Webb's answer, if possible,\r\n    to reach them by 2 o'clock afternoon to-day. If Mr. Webb says yes (you\r\n    will open his note), send Dominico with it to them, and he passing by\r\n    the Baths must order Pancani to be at Pugnano by 5 o'clock in the\r\n    afternoon. If there comes no letter from Mr. Webb, they will equally\r\n    come to you, and I wish you could also in that case contrive to get\r\n    Pancani ordered for them, for we forgot to arrange how that could be\r\n    done; if not, they will be there expecting, and perhaps get involved\r\n    for the next month. I wish you to be so good as to send me immediately\r\n    my large box and the clothes from the Busati, indeed all that you have\r\n    of mine, for I must arrange my boxes to get them _bollate_\r\n    immediately. Don't delay, and my band-box too. If you could of your\r\n    great bounty give me a sponge, I should be infinitely obliged to you.\r\n    Then, when it is dark, and the Williams' arrived, will you ask Mr.\r\n    Williams to be so good as to come and knock at Casa Silva, and I will\r\n    return to spend the evening with you? Shelley won't do to fetch me,\r\n    because he looks singular in the streets. But I wish he would come now\r\n    to give me some money, as I want to write to Livorno and arrange\r\n    everything. Later will be inconvenient for me. Kiss the chick for me,\r\n    and believe me, yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n      CLARE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Journal._--All October is left out, it seems.--We are at the Baths,\r\n    occupied with furnishing our house, copying my novel, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nMary's intention was to devote any profits which might proceed from this\r\nwork to the relief of her father's necessities, and the hope of being able\r\nto help him had stimulated her industry and energy while it eased her\r\nheart. She aimed at selling the copyright for L400, and Shelley opened\r\nnegotiations to this effect with Ollier the publisher. His letter on the\r\nsubject bears such striking testimony to the estimate he had formed of\r\nMary's powers, and gives, besides, so complete a sketch of the novel\r\nitself, that it cannot be omitted here.\r\n\r\n    SHELLEY TO MR. OLLIER.\r\n\r\n    PISA, _25th September 1822_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR--It will give me great pleasure if I can arrange the affair\r\n    of Mrs. Shelley's novel with you to her and your satisfaction. She has\r\n    a specific purpose in the sum which she instructed me to require, and,\r\n    although this purpose could not be answered without ready money, yet I\r\n    should find means to answer her wishes in that point if you could make\r\n    it convenient to pay one-third at Christmas, and give bills for the\r\n    other two-thirds at twelve and eighteen months. It would give me\r\n    peculiar satisfaction that you, rather than any other person, should\r\n    be the publisher of this work; it is the product of no slight labour,\r\n    and I flatter myself, of no common talent, I doubt not it will give no\r\n    less credit than it will receive from your names. I trust you know me\r\n    too well to believe that my judgment deliberately given in testimony\r\n    of the value of any production is influenced by motives of interest or\r\n    partiality.\r\n\r\n    The romance is called _Castruccio, Prince of Lucca_, and is founded,\r\n    not upon the novel of Machiavelli under that name, which substitutes a\r\n    childish fiction for the far more romantic truth of history, but upon\r\n    the actual story of his life. He was a person who, from an exile and\r\n    an adventurer, after having served in the wars of England and Flanders\r\n    in the reign of our Edward the Second, returned to his native city,\r\n    and liberating it from its tyrants, became himself its tyrant, and\r\n    died in the full splendour of his dominion, which he had extended over\r\n    the half of Tuscany. He was a little Napoleon, and with a dukedom\r\n    instead of an empire for his theatre, brought upon the same all the\r\n    passions and errors of his antitype. The chief interest of the romance\r\n    rests upon Euthanasia, his betrothed bride, whose love for him is only\r\n    equalled by her enthusiasm for the liberty of the Republic of\r\n    Florence, which is in some sort her country, and for that of Italy, to\r\n    which Castruccio is a devoted enemy, being an ally of the party of the\r\n    Emperor. This character is a masterpiece; and the keystone of the\r\n    drama, which is built up with admirable art, is the conflict between\r\n    these passions and these principles. Euthanasia, the last survivor of\r\n    a noble house, is a feudal countess, and her castle is the scene of\r\n    the exhibition of the knightly manners of the time. The character of\r\n    Beatrice, the prophetess, can only be done justice to in the very\r\n    language of the author. I know nothing in Walter Scott's novels which\r\n    at all approaches to the beauty and the sublimity of this--creation, I\r\n    may say, for it is perfectly original; and, although founded upon the\r\n    ideas and manners of the age which is represented, is wholly without\r\n    a similitude in any fiction I ever read. Beatrice is in love with\r\n    Castruccio, and dies; for the romance, although interspersed with much\r\n    lighter matter, is deeply tragic, and the shades darken and gather as\r\n    the catastrophe approaches. All the manners, customs of the age, are\r\n    introduced; the superstitions, the heresies, and the religious\r\n    persecutions are displayed; the minutest circumstance of Italian\r\n    manners in that age is not omitted; and the whole seems to me to\r\n    constitute a living and moving picture of an age almost forgotten. The\r\n    author visited the scenery which she describes in person; and one or\r\n    two of the inferior characters are drawn from her own observation of\r\n    the Italians, for the national character shows itself still in certain\r\n    instances under the same forms as it wore in the time of Dante. The\r\n    novel consists, as I told you before, of three volumes, each at least\r\n    equal to one of the _Tales of my Landlord_, and they will be very soon\r\n    ready to be sent.\r\n\r\nNo arrangement, however, was come to at this time, and early in January\r\nMary wrote to her father, offering the work to him, and asking him, if he\r\naccepted it, to make a bargain concerning it with a publisher.\r\n\r\nGodwin accepted the offer, and undertook the responsibility, in a letter\r\nfrom which the following is an extract--\r\n\r\n    _31st January 1822._\r\n\r\n    I am much gratified by your letter of the 11th, which reached me on\r\n    Saturday last; it is truly generous of you to desire that I would make\r\n    use of the produce of your novel. But what can I say to it? It is\r\n    against the course of nature, unless, indeed, you were actually in\r\n    possession of a fortune.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I said in the preface to _Mandeville_ there were two or three works\r\n    further that I should be glad to finish before I died. If I make use\r\n    of the money from you in the way you suggest, that may enable me to\r\n    complete my present work.\r\n\r\nThe MS. was, accordingly, despatched to England, but was not published\r\ntill many months later.\r\n\r\n_Valperga_ (as it was afterwards called) was a book of much power and more\r\npromise; very remarkable when the author's age is taken into\r\nconsideration. Apart from local colouring, the interest of the tale turns\r\non the development of the character--naturally powerful and disposed to\r\ngood, but spoilt by popularity and success, and unguided by principle--of\r\nCastruccio himself; and on the contrast between him and Euthanasia, the\r\nnoble and beautiful woman who sacrifices her possessions, her hopes, and\r\nher affections to the cause of fidelity and patriotism.\r\n\r\nBeatrice, the prophetess, is one of those gifted but fated souls, who,\r\nunder the persuasion that they are supernaturally inspired, mistake the\r\nordinary impulses of human nature for Divine commands, and, finding their\r\nmistake, yet encourage themselves in what they know to be delusion till\r\nthe end,--a tragic end.\r\n\r\nThere are some remarkable descriptive passages, especially one where the\r\nwandering Beatrice comes suddenly upon a house in a dreary landscape which\r\nshe knows, although she has never seen it before except in a haunting\r\ndream; every detail of it is horribly familiar, and she is paralysed by\r\nthe sense of imminent calamity, which, in fact, bursts upon her directly\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nEuthanasia dies at sea, and the account of the running down and wreck of\r\nher ship is a curious, almost prophetic, foreshadowing of the calamity by\r\nwhich, all too soon, Shelley was to lose his life.\r\n\r\n    The wind changed to a more northerly direction during the night, and\r\n    the land-breeze of the morning filled their sails, so that, although\r\n    slowly, they dropt down southward. About noon they met a Pisan vessel,\r\n    who bade them beware of a Genoese squadron, which was cruising off\r\n    Corsica; so they bore in nearer to the shore. At sunset that day a\r\n    fierce sirocco arose, accompanied by thunder and lightning, such as is\r\n    seldom seen during the winter season. Presently they saw huge dark\r\n    columns descending from heaven, and meeting the sea, which boiled\r\n    beneath; they were borne on by the storm, and scattered by the wind.\r\n    The rain came down in sheets, and the hail clattered, as it fell to\r\n    its grave in the ocean; the ocean was lashed into such waves that,\r\n    many miles inland, during the pauses of the wind, the hoarse and\r\n    constant murmurs of the far-off sea made the well-housed landsman\r\n    mutter one more prayer for those exposed to its fury.\r\n\r\n    Such was the storm, as it was seen from shore. Nothing more was ever\r\n    known of the Sicilian vessel which bore Euthanasia. It never reached\r\n    its destined port, nor were any of those on board ever after seen. The\r\n    sentinels who watched near Vado, a town on the sea-beach of the\r\n    Maremma, found on the following day that the waves had washed on shore\r\n    some of the wrecks of a vessel; they picked up a few planks and a\r\n    broken mast, round which, tangled with some of its cordage, was a\r\n    white silk handkerchief, such a one as had bound the tresses of\r\n    Euthanasia the night that she had embarked; and in its knot were a few\r\n    golden hairs.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo follow the fate of Mary's novel, it has been necessary somewhat to\r\nanticipate the history, which is resumed in the next chapter, with the\r\njournal and letters of the latter part of 1821.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 1821-APRIL 1822\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Journal, Thursday, November 1._--Go to Florence.

GISBORNE--Although having much to do be a bad excuse for\r\n    not writing to you, yet you must in some sort admit this plea on my\r\n    part. Here we are in Pisa, having furnished very nice apartments for\r\n    ourselves, and what is more, paid for the furniture out of the fruits\r\n    of two years' economy, we are at the top of the Tre Palazzi di Chiesa.\r\n    I daresay you know the house, next door to La Scoto's house on the\r\n    north side of Lung' Arno; but the rooms we inhabit are south, and look\r\n    over the whole country towards the sea, so that we are entirely out of\r\n    the bustle and disagreeable _puzzi_, etc., of the town, and hardly\r\n    know that we are so enveloped until we descend into the street. The\r\n    Williams' have been less lucky, though they have followed our example\r\n    in furnishing their own house, but, renting it of Mr. Webb, they have\r\n    been treated scurvily. So here we live, Lord Byron just opposite to us\r\n    in Casa Lanfranchi (the late Signora Felichi's house). So Pisa, you\r\n    see, has become a little nest of singing birds. You will be both\r\n    surprised and delighted at the work just about to be published by him;\r\n    his _Cain_, which is in the highest style of imaginative poetry. It\r\n    made a great impression upon me, and appears almost a revelation, from\r\n    its power and beauty. Shelley rides with him; I, of course, see little\r\n    of him. The lady _whom he serves_ is a nice pretty girl without\r\n    pretensions, good hearted and amiable; her relations were banished\r\n    Romagna for Carbonarism.\r\n\r\n    What do you know of Hunt? About two months ago he wrote to say that on\r\n    21st October he should quit England, and we have heard nothing more of\r\n    him in any way; I expect some day he and six children will drop in\r\n    from the clouds, trusting that God will temper the wind to the shorn\r\n    lamb. Pray when you write, tell us everything you know concerning him.\r\n    Do you get any intelligence of the Greeks? Our worthy countrymen take\r\n    part against them in every possible way, yet such is the spirit of\r\n    freedom, and such the hatred of these poor people for their\r\n    oppressors, that I have the warmest hopes--[Greek: mantis eim' esthlon\r\n    agonon]. Mavrocordato is there, justly revered for the sacrifice he\r\n    has made of his whole fortune to the cause, and besides for his\r\n    firmness and talents. If Greece be free, Shelley and I have vowed to\r\n    go, perhaps to settle there, in one of those beautiful islands where\r\n    earth, ocean, and sky form the paradise. You will, I hope, tell us all\r\n    the news of our friends when you write. I see no one that you know. We\r\n    live in our usual retired way, with few friends and no acquaintances.\r\n    Clare is returned to her usual residence, and our tranquillity is\r\n    unbroken in upon, except by those winds, sirocco or tramontana, which\r\n    now and then will sweep over the ocean of one's mind and disturb or\r\n    cloud its surface. Since this must be a double letter, I save myself\r\n    the trouble of copying the enclosed, which was a part of a letter\r\n    written to you a month ago, but which I did not send. Will you attend\r\n    to my requests? Every day increases my anxiety concerning the desk. Do\r\n    have the goodness to pack it off as soon as you can.\r\n\r\n    Shelley was at your hive yesterday; it is as dirty and busy as ever,\r\n    so people live in the same narrow circle of space and thought, while\r\n    time goes on, not as a racehorse, but a \"six inside dilly,\" and puts\r\n    them down softly at their journey's end; while they have slept and\r\n    ate, and _ecco tutto_. With this piece of morality, dear Mrs.\r\n    Gisborne, I end. Shelley begs every remembrance of his to be joined\r\n    with mine to Mr. Gisborne and Henry.--Ever yours,\r\n\r\n      MARY W. S.\r\n\r\n    And now, my dear Mrs. Gisborne, I have a great favour to ask of you.\r\n    Ollier writes to say that he has placed our two desks in the hands of\r\n    a merchant of the city, and that they are to come--God knows when!\r\n    Now, as we sent for them two years ago, and are tired of waiting, will\r\n    you do us the favour to get them out of his hands, and to send them\r\n    without delay? If they can be sent without being opened, send them _in\r\n    statu quo_; if they must be opened, do not send the smallest but get a\r\n    key (being a patent lock a key will cost half a guinea) made for the\r\n    largest and send it, and return the other to Peacock. If you send the\r\n    desk, will you send with it the following things?--A few copies of all\r\n    Shelley's works, particularly of the second edition of the _Cenci_, my\r\n    mother's posthumous works, and _Letters from Norway_ from Peacock, if\r\n    you can, but do not delay the box for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Journal, Sunday, December 2._--Read the _History of Shipwrecks_. Read\r\n    Herodotus with Shelley. Ride with La Guiccioli. Pietro and her in the\r\n    evening.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, December 3._--Write letters. Read Herodotus with Shelley.\r\n    Finish _Caleb Williams_ to Jane. Taafe calls. He says that his Turk is\r\n    a very moral man, for that when he began a scandalous story he\r\n    interrupted him immediately, saying, \"Ah! we must never speak thus of\r\n    our neighbours!\" Taafe would do well to take the hint.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, December 6._--Read Homer. Walk with Williams. Spend the\r\n    evening with them. Call on T. Guiccioli with Jane, while Taafe amuses\r\n    Shelley and Edward. Read Tacitus. A dismal day.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, December 7._--Letter from Hunt and Bessy. Walk with Shelley.\r\n    Buy furniture for them, etc. Walk with Edward and Jane to the garden,\r\n    and return with T. Guiccioli in the carriage. Edward reads the\r\n    _Shipwreck of the Wager_ to us in the evening.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, December 8._--Get up late and talk with Shelley. The\r\n    Williams and Medwin to dinner. Walk with Edward and Jane in the\r\n    garden. Return with T. Guiccioli. T. G. and Pietro in the evening.\r\n    Write to Clare. Read Tacitus.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, December 9._--Go to church at Dr. Nott's. Walk with Edward\r\n    and Jane in the garden. In the evening first Pietro and Teresa,\r\n    afterwards go to the Williams'.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, December 10._--Out shopping. Walk with the Williams and T.\r\n    Guiccioli to the garden. Medwin at tea. Afterwards we are alone, and\r\n    after reading a little Herodotus, Shelley reads Chaucer's _Flower and\r\n    the Leaf_, and then Chaucer's _Dream_ to me. A divine, cold,\r\n    tramontana day.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, January 14._--Read _Emile_. Call on T. Guiccioli and see Lord\r\n    Byron. Trelawny arrives.\r\n\r\nEdward John Trelawny, whose subsequent history was to be closely bound up\r\nwith that of Shelley and of Mrs. Shelley, was of good Cornish family, and\r\nhad led a wandering life, full of romantic adventure. He had become\r\nacquainted with Williams and Medwin in Switzerland a year before, since\r\nwhich he had been in Paris and London. Tired of a town life and of\r\nsociety, and in order to \"maintain the just equilibrium between the body\r\nand the brain,\" he had determined to pass the next winter hunting and\r\nshooting in the wilds of the Maremma, with a Captain Roberts and\r\nLieutenant Williams. For the exercise of his brain, he proposed passing\r\nthe summer with Shelley and Byron, boating in the Mediterranean, as he had\r\nheard that they proposed doing. Neither of the poets were as yet\r\npersonally known to him, but he had lost no time in seeking their\r\nacquaintance. On the very evening of his arrival in Pisa he repaired to\r\nthe Tre Palazzi, where, in the Williams' room, he first saw Shelley, and\r\nwas struck speechless with astonishment.\r\n\r\n    Was it possible this mild-looking beardless boy could be the veritable\r\n    monster at war with all the world? Excommunicated by the Fathers of\r\n    the Church, deprived of his civil rights by the fiat of a grim Lord\r\n    Chancellor, discarded by every member of his family, and denounced by\r\n    the rival sages of our literature as the founder of a Satanic school?\r\n    I could not believe it; it must be a hoax.\r\n\r\nBut presently, when Shelley was led to talk on a theme that interested\r\nhim--the works of Calderon,--his marvellous powers of mind and command of\r\nlanguage held Trelawny spell-bound: \"After this touch of his quality,\" he\r\nsays, \"I no longer doubted his identity.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelley appeared soon after, and the visitor looked with lively\r\ncuriosity at the daughter of William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft.\r\n\r\n    Such a rare pedigree of genius was enough to interest me in her,\r\n    irrespective of her own merits as an authoress. The most striking\r\n    feature in her face was her calm, gray eyes; she was rather under the\r\n    English standard of woman's height, very fair and light-haired; witty,\r\n    social, and animated in the society of friends, though mournful in\r\n    solitude; like Shelley, though in a minor degree, she had the power of\r\n    expressing her thoughts in varied and appropriate words, derived from\r\n    familiarity with the works of our vigorous old writers. Neither of\r\n    them used obsolete or foreign words. This command of our language\r\n    struck me the more as contrasted with the scanty vocabulary used by\r\n    ladies in society, in which a score of poor hackneyed phrases suffice\r\n    to express all that is felt or considered proper to reveal.[45]\r\n\r\nMary's impressions of the new-comer may be gathered from her journal and\r\nher subsequent letter to Mrs. Gisborne.\r\n\r\n    _Journal, Saturday, January 19._--Copy. Walk with Jane. The Opera in\r\n    the evening. Trelawny is extravagant--_un giovane\r\n    stravagante_,--partly natural, and partly, perhaps, put on, but it\r\n    suits him well, and if his abrupt but not unpolished manners be\r\n    assumed, they are nevertheless in unison with his Moorish face (for he\r\n    looks Oriental yet not Asiatic), his dark hair, his Herculean form;\r\n    and then there is an air of extreme good nature which pervades his\r\n    whole countenance, especially when he smiles, which assures me that\r\n    his heart is good. He tells strange stories of himself, horrific ones,\r\n    so that they harrow one up, while with his emphatic but unmodulated\r\n    voice, his simple yet strong language, he pourtrays the most\r\n    frightful situations; then all these adventures took place between the\r\n    ages of thirteen and twenty.\r\n\r\n    I believe them now I see the man, and, tired with the everyday\r\n    sleepiness of human intercourse, I am glad to meet with one who, among\r\n    other valuable qualities, has the rare merit of interesting my\r\n    imagination. The _crew_ and Medwin dine with us.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, January 27._--Read Homer. Walk. Dine at the Williams'. The\r\n    Opera in the evening. Ride with T. Guiccioli.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, January 28._--The Williams breakfast with us. Go down Bocca\r\n    d'Arno in the boat with Shelley and Jane. Edward and E. Trelawny meet\r\n    us there; return in the gig; they dine with us; very tired.\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, January 29._--Read Homer and Tacitus. Ride with T.\r\n    Guiccioli. E. Trelawny and Medwin to dinner. The Baron Lutzerode in\r\n    the evening.\r\n\r\n      But as the torrent widens towards the ocean,\r\n      We ponder deeply on each past emotion.\r\n\r\n    Read the first volume of the _Pirate_.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, February 3._--Read Homer. Walk to the garden with Jane.\r\n    Return with Medwin to dinner. Trelawny in the evening. A wild day and\r\n    night, some clouds in the sky in the morning, but they clear away. A\r\n    north wind.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, February 4._--Breakfast with the Williams'. Edward, Jane, and\r\n    Trelawny go to Leghorn. Walk with Jane. Southey's letter concerning\r\n    Lord Byron. Write to Clare. In the evening the Gambas and Taafe.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, February 7._--Read Homer, Tacitus, and _Emile_. Shelley and\r\n    Edward depart for La Spezzia. Walk with Jane, and to the Opera with\r\n    her in the evening. With E. Trelawny afterwards to Mrs. Beauclerc's\r\n    ball. During a long, long evening in mixed society how often do one's\r\n    sensations change, and, swiftly as the west wind drives the shadows of\r\n    clouds across the sunny hill or the waving corn, so swift do\r\n    sensations pass, painting--yet, oh! not disfiguring--the serenity of\r\n    the mind. It is then that life seems to weigh itself, and hosts of\r\n    memories and imaginations, thrown into one scale, make the other kick\r\n    the beam. You remember what you have felt, what you have dreamt; yet\r\n    you dwell on the shadowy side, and lost hopes and death, such as you\r\n    have seen it, seem to cover all things with a funeral pall.\r\n\r\n    The time that was, is, and will be, presses upon you, and, standing\r\n    the centre of a moving circle, you \"slide giddily as the world reels.\"\r\n    You look to heaven, and would demand of the everlasting stars that the\r\n    thoughts and passions which are your life may be as ever-living as\r\n    they. You would demand of the blue empyrean that your mind might be as\r\n    clear as it, and that the tears which gather in your eyes might be the\r\n    shower that would drain from its profoundest depths the springs of\r\n    weakness and sorrow. But where are the stars? Where the blue empyrean?\r\n    A ceiling clouds that, and a thousand swift consuming lights supply\r\n    the place of the eternal ones of heaven. The enthusiast suppresses her\r\n    tears, crushes her opening thoughts, and.... But all is changed; some\r\n    word, some look excite the lagging blood, laughter dances in the eyes,\r\n    and the spirits rise proportionably high.\r\n\r\n      The Queen is all for revels, her light heart,\r\n      Unladen from the heaviness of state,\r\n      Bestows itself upon delightfulness.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, February 8._--Sometimes I awaken from my visionary monotony,\r\n    and my thoughts flow until, as it is exquisite pain to stop the\r\n    flowing of the blood, so is it painful to check expression and make\r\n    the overflowing mind return to its usual channel. I feel a kind of\r\n    tenderness to those, whoever they may be (even though strangers), who\r\n    awaken the train and touch a chord so full of harmony and thrilling\r\n    music, when I would tear the veil from this strange world, and pierce\r\n    with eagle eyes beyond the sun; when every idea, strange and\r\n    changeful, is another step in the ladder by which I would climb....\r\n\r\n    Read _Emile_. Jane dines with me, walk with her. E. Trelawny and Jane\r\n    in the evening. Trelawny tells us a number of amusing stories of his\r\n    early life. Read third canto of _L'Inferno_.\r\n\r\n    They say that Providence is shown by the extraction that may be ever\r\n    made of good from evil, that we draw our virtues from our faults. So I\r\n    am to thank God for making me weak. I might say, \"Thy will be done,\"\r\n    but I cannot applaud the permitter of self-degradation, though dignity\r\n    and superior wisdom arise from its bitter and burning ashes.\r\n\r\n    _Saturday, February 9._--Read _Emile_. Walk with Jane, and ride with\r\n    T. Guiccioli. Dine with Jane. Taafe and T. Medwin call. I retire with\r\n    E. Trelawny, who amuses me as usual by the endless variety of his\r\n    adventures and conversation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MARY TO MRS. GISBORNE.\r\n\r\n    PISA, _9th February 1822_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MRS. GISBORNE--Not having heard from you, I am anxious about\r\n    my desk. It would have been a great convenience to me if I could have\r\n    received it at the beginning of the winter, but now I should like it\r\n    as soon as possible. I hope that it is out of Ollier's hands. I have\r\n    before said what I would have done with it. If both desks can be sent\r\n    without being opened, let them be sent; if not, give the small one\r\n    back to Peacock. Get a key made for the larger, and send it, I entreat\r\n    you, by the very next vessel. This key will cost half a guinea, and\r\n    Ollier will not give you the money, but give me credit for it, I\r\n    entreat you. I pray now let me have the desk as soon as possible.\r\n    Shelley is now gone to Spezzia to get houses for our colony for the\r\n    summer.\r\n\r\n    It will be a large one, too large, I am afraid, for unity; yet I hope\r\n    not. There will be Lord Byron, who will have a large and beautiful\r\n    boat built on purpose by some English navy officers at Genoa. There\r\n    will be the Countess Guiccioli and her brother; the Williams', whom\r\n    you know; Trelawny, a kind of half-Arab Englishman, whose life has\r\n    been as changeful as that of Anastasius, and who recounts the\r\n    adventures as eloquently and as well as the imagined Greek. He is\r\n    clever; for his moral qualities I am yet in the dark; he is a strange\r\n    web which I am endeavouring to unravel. I would fain learn if\r\n    generosity is united to impetuousness, probity of spirit to his\r\n    assumption of singularity and independence. He is 6 feet high, raven\r\n    black hair, which curls thickly and shortly, like a Moor's, dark gray\r\n    expressive eyes, overhanging brows, upturned lips, and a smile which\r\n    expresses good nature and kindheartedness. His shoulders are high,\r\n    like an Oriental's, his voice is monotonous, yet emphatic, and his\r\n    language, as he relates the events of his life, energetic and simple,\r\n    whether the tale be one of blood and horror, or of irresistible\r\n    comedy. His company is delightful, for he excites me to think, and if\r\n    any evil shade the intercourse, that time will unveil--the sun will\r\n    rise or night darken all. There will be, besides, a Captain Roberts,\r\n    whom I do not know, a very rough subject, I fancy,--a famous angler,\r\n    etc. We are to have a small boat, and now that those first divine\r\n    spring days are come (you know them well), the sky clear, the sun hot,\r\n    the hedges budding, we sitting without a fire and the windows open, I\r\n    begin to long for the sparkling waves, the olive-coloured hills and\r\n    vine-shaded pergolas of Spezzia. However, it would be madness to go\r\n    yet. Yet as _ceppo_ was bad, we hope for a good _pasqua_, and if April\r\n    prove fine, we shall fly with the swallows. The Opera here has been\r\n    detestable. The English Sinclair is the _primo tenore_, and acquits\r\n    himself excellently, but the Italians, after the first, have enviously\r\n    selected such operas as give him little or nothing to do. We have\r\n    English here, and some English balls and parties, to which I\r\n    (_mirabile dictu_) go sometimes. We have Taafe, who bores us out of\r\n    our senses when he comes, telling a young lady that her eyes shed\r\n    flowers--why therefore should he send her any? I have sent my novel to\r\n    Papa. I long to hear some news of it, as, with an author's vanity, I\r\n    want to see it in print, and hear the praises of my friends. I should\r\n    like, as I said when you went away, a copy of _Matilda_. It might come\r\n    out with the desk. I hope as the town fills to hear better news of\r\n    your plans, we long to hear from you. What does Henry do? How many\r\n    times has he been in love?--Ever yours,\r\n\r\n      M. W. S.\r\n\r\n    Shelley would like to see the review of the _Prometheus_ in the\r\n    _Quarterly_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, February 14._--Read Homer and _Anastasius_. Walk with the\r\n    Williams' in the evening.... \"Nothing of us but what must suffer a\r\n    sea-change.\"\r\n\r\nThis entry marks the day to which Mary referred in a letter written more\r\nthan a year later, where she says--\r\n\r\n    A year ago Trelawny came one afternoon in high spirits with news\r\n    concerning the building of the boat, saying, \"Oh! we must all embark,\r\n    all live aboard; we will all 'suffer a sea-change.'\" And dearest\r\n    Shelley was delighted with the quotation, saying that he would have it\r\n    for the motto for his boat.\r\n\r\nLittle did they think, in their lightness of spirit, that in another year\r\nthe motto of the boat would serve for the inscription on Shelley's tomb.\r\n\r\n    _Journal, Monday, February 18._--Read Homer. Walk with the Williams'.\r\n    Jane, Trelawny, and Medwin in the evening.[46]\r\n\r\n    _Monday, February 25._--What a mart this world is? Feelings,\r\n    sentiments,--more invaluable than gold or precious stones is the coin,\r\n    and what is bought? Contempt, discontent, and disappointment, unless,\r\n    indeed, the mind be loaded with drearier memories. And what say the\r\n    worldly to this? Use Spartan coin, pay away iron and lead alone, and\r\n    store up your precious metal. But alas! from nothing, nothing comes,\r\n    or, as all things seem to degenerate, give lead and you will receive\r\n    clay,--the most contemptible of all lives is where you live in the\r\n    world, and none of your passions or affections are brought into\r\n    action. I am convinced I could not live thus, and as Sterne says that\r\n    in solitude he would worship a tree, so in the world I should attach\r\n    myself to those who bore the semblance of those qualities which I\r\n    admire. But it is not this that I want; let me love the trees, the\r\n    skies, and the ocean, and that all-encompassing spirit of which I may\r\n    soon become a part,--let me in my fellow-creature love that which is,\r\n    and not fix my affection on a fair form endued with imaginary\r\n    attributes; where goodness, kindness, and talent are, let me love and\r\n    admire them at their just rate, neither adorning nor diminishing, and\r\n    above all, let me fearlessly descend into the remotest caverns of my\r\n    own mind; carry the torch of self-knowledge into its dimmest recesses;\r\n    but too happy if I dislodge any evil spirit, or enshrine a new deity\r\n    in some hitherto uninhabited nook.\r\n\r\n    Read _Wrongs of Women_ and Homer. Clare departs. Walk with Jane and\r\n    ride with T. Guiccioli. T. G. dines with us.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, February 28._--Take leave of the Argyropolis. Walk with\r\n    Shelley. Ride with T. Guiccioli. Read letters. Spend the evening at\r\n    the Williams'. Trelawny there.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, March 1._--An embassy. Walk. My first Greek lesson. Walk with\r\n    Edward. In the evening work.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, March 3._--A note to, and a visit from, Dr. Nott. Go to\r\n    church. Walk. The Williams' and Trelawny to dinner.\r\n\r\nMary's experiments in the way of church-going, so new a thing in her\r\nexperience, and so little in accordance with Shelley's habits of thought\r\nand action, excited some surprise and comment. Hogg, Shelley's early\r\nfriend, who heard of it from Mrs. Gisborne, now in England, was\r\nespecially shocked. In a letter to Mary, Mrs. Gisborne remarked, \"Your\r\nfriend Hogg is _molto scandalizzato_ to hear of your weekly visits to the\r\n_piano di sotto_\" (the services were held on the ground floor of the Tre\r\nPalazzi).\r\n\r\nThe same letter asks for news of Emilia Viviani. Mrs. Gisborne had heard\r\nthat she was married, and feared she had been sacrificed to a man whom she\r\ndescribes as \"that insipid, sickening Italian mortal, Danieli the lawyer.\"\r\nShe proceeds to say--\r\n\r\n    We invited Varley one evening to meet Hogg, who was curious to see a\r\n    man really believing in astrology in the nineteenth century. Varley,\r\n    as usual, was not sparing of his predictions. We talked of Shelley\r\n    without mentioning his name; Varley was curious, and being informed by\r\n    Hogg of his exact age, but describing his person as short and\r\n    corpulent, and himself as a _bon vivant_, Varley amused us with the\r\n    following remarks: \"Your friend suffered from ill-fortune in May or\r\n    June 1815. Vexatious affairs on the 2d and 14th of June, or perhaps\r\n    latter end of May 1820. The following year, disturbance about a lady.\r\n    Again, last April, at 10 at night, or at noon, disturbance about a\r\n    bouncing stout lady, and others. At six years of age, noticed by\r\n    ladies and gentlemen for learning. In July 1799, beginning of charges\r\n    made against him. In September 1800, at noon, or dusk, very violent\r\n    charges. Scrape at fourteen years of age. Eternal warfare against\r\n    parents and public opinion, and a great blow-up every seven years till\r\n    death,\" etc. etc. _Is all this true?_\r\n\r\nNot a little amused, Mary answered her friend as follows--\r\n\r\n    PISA, _7th March 1822_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MRS. GISBORNE--I am very sorry that you have so much trouble\r\n    with my commissions, and vainly, too! _ma che vuole?_ Ollier will not\r\n    give you the money, and we are, to tell you the truth, too poor at\r\n    present to send you a cheque upon our banker; two or three\r\n    circumstances having caused\r\n\r\n      That climax of all human ills,\r\n      The inflammation of our weekly bills.\r\n\r\n    But far more than that, we have not touched a quattrino of our\r\n    Christmas quarter, since debts in England and other calls swallowed it\r\n    entirely up. For the present, therefore, we must dispense with those\r\n    things I asked you for. As for the desk, we received last post from\r\n    Ollier (without a line) the bill of lading that he talks of, and, _si\r\n    Dio vuole_, we shall receive it safe; the vessel in which they were\r\n    shipped is not yet arrived. The worst of keeping on with Ollier\r\n    (though it is the best, I believe, after all) is that you will never\r\n    be able to make anything of his accounts, until you can compare the\r\n    number of copies in hand with his account of their sale. As for my\r\n    novel, I shipped it off long ago to my father, telling him to make the\r\n    best of it; and by the way in which he answered my letter, I fancy he\r\n    thinks he can make something of it. This is much better than Ollier,\r\n    for I should never have got a penny from him; and, moreover, he is a\r\n    very bad bookseller to publish with--_ma basta poi_, with all these\r\n    _seccaturas_.\r\n\r\n    Poor dear Hunt, you will have heard by this time of the disastrous\r\n    conclusion of his third embarkment; he is to try a third time in\r\n    April, and if he does not succeed then, we must say that the sea is\r\n    _un vero precipizio_, and let him try land. By the bye, why not\r\n    consult Varley on the result? I have tried the _Sors Homeri_ and the\r\n    _Sors Virgilii_; the first says (I will write this Greek better, but I\r\n    thought that Mr. Gisborne could read the Romaic writing, and I now\r\n    quite forget what it was)--\r\n\r\n      [Greek: Elomen, teios moi adelpheon allos epephnen.\r\n      hos d'opot' Iasioni euplokamos Demeter.\r\n      Dourateon megan hippon, hoth' heiato pantes aristoi.]\r\n\r\n    Which first seems to say that he will come, though his brother may be\r\n    prosecuted for a libel. Of the second, I can make neither head nor\r\n    tail; and the third is as oracularly obscure as one could wish, for\r\n    who these great people are who sat in a wooden horse, _chi lo sa_?\r\n    Virgil, except the first line, which is unfavourable, is as\r\n    enigmatical as Homer--\r\n\r\n      Fulgores nunc horrificos, sonitumque, metumque\r\n      Tum leves calamos, et rasae hastilia virgae\r\n      Connexosque angues, ipsamque in pectore divae.\r\n\r\n    But to speak of predictions or anteductions, some of Varley's are\r\n    curious enough: \"Ill-fortune in May or June 1815.\" No; it was then\r\n    that he arranged his income; there was no ill except health, _al\r\n    solito_, at that time. The particular days of the 2d and 14th of June\r\n    1820 were not ill, but the whole time was disastrous. It was then we\r\n    were alarmed by Paolo's attack and disturbance. About a lady in the\r\n    winter of last year, enough, God knows! Nothing particular about a fat\r\n    bouncing lady at 10 at night: and indeed things got more quiet in\r\n    April. In July 1799 Shelley was only seven years of age. \"A great\r\n    blow-up every seven years.\" Shelley is not at home; when he returns I\r\n    will ask him what happened when he was fourteen. In his twenty-second\r\n    year we made our _scappatura_; at twenty-eight and twenty-nine, a good\r\n    deal of discomfort on a certain point, but it hardly amounted to a\r\n    blow-up. Pray ask Varley also about me.\r\n\r\n    So Hogg is shocked that, for good neighbourhood's sake, I visited the\r\n    _piano di sotto_; let him reassure himself, since instead of a weekly,\r\n    it was only a monthly visit; in fact, after going three times I stayed\r\n    away until I heard he was going away. He preached against atheism,\r\n    and, they said, against Shelley. As he invited me himself to come,\r\n    this appeared to me very impertinent; so I wrote to him, to ask him\r\n    whether he intended any personal allusion, but he denied the charge\r\n    most entirely. This affair, as you may guess, among the English at\r\n    Pisa made a great noise; the gossip here is of course out of all\r\n    bounds, and some people have given them something to talk about. I\r\n    have seen little of it all; but that which I have seen makes me long\r\n    most eagerly for some sea-girt isle, where with Shelley, my babe, and\r\n    books and horses, we may give the rest to the winds; this we shall not\r\n    have for the present. Shelley is entangled with Lord Byron, who is in\r\n    a terrible fright lest he should desert him. We shall have boats, and\r\n    go somewhere on the sea-coast, where, I daresay, we shall spend our\r\n    time agreeably enough, for I like the Williams' exceedingly, though\r\n    there my list begins and ends.\r\n\r\n    Emilia married Biondi; we hear that she leads him and his mother (to\r\n    use a vulgarism) a devil of a life. The conclusion of our friendship\r\n    (_a la Italiana_) puts me in mind of a nursery rhyme, which runs\r\n    thus--\r\n\r\n      As I was going down Cranbourne lane,\r\n      Cranbourne lane was dirty,\r\n      And there I met a pretty maid,\r\n      Who dropt to me a curtsey;\r\n\r\n      I gave her cakes, I gave her wine,\r\n      I gave her sugar-candy,\r\n      But oh! the little naughty girl,\r\n      She asked me for some brandy.\r\n\r\n    Now turn \"Cranbourne Lane\" into Pisan acquaintances, which I am sure\r\n    are dirty enough, and \"brandy\" into that wherewithal to buy brandy\r\n    (and that no small sum _pero_), and you have the whole story of\r\n    Shelley's Italian Platonics. We now know, indeed, few of those whom we\r\n    knew last year. Pacchiani is at Prato; Mavrocordato in Greece; the\r\n    Argyropolis in Florence; and so the world slides. Taafe is still\r\n    here--the butt of Lord Byron's quizzing, and the poet laureate of\r\n    Pisa. On the occasion of a young lady's birthday he wrote--\r\n\r\n      Eyes that shed a thousand flowers!\r\n      Why should flowers be sent to you?\r\n      Sweetest flowers of heavenly bowers,\r\n      Love and friendship, are what are due.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    After some divine _Italian_ weather, we are now enjoying some fine\r\n    English weather; _cioe_, it does not rain, but not a ray can pierce\r\n    the web aloft.--Most truly yours,\r\n\r\n      MARY W. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MARY SHELLEY TO MRS. HUNT.\r\n\r\n    _5th March 1822._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST MARIANNE--I hope that this letter will find you quite well,\r\n    recovering from your severe attack, and looking towards your haven\r\n    Italy with best hopes. I do indeed believe that you will find a relief\r\n    here from your many English cares, and that the winds which waft you\r\n    will sing the requiem to all your ills. It was indeed unfortunate that\r\n    you encountered such weather on the very threshold of your journey,\r\n    and as the wind howled through the long night, how often did I think\r\n    of you! At length it seemed as if we should never, never meet; but I\r\n    will not give way to such a presentiment. We enjoy here divine\r\n    weather. The sun hot, too hot, with a freshness and clearness in the\r\n    breeze that bears with it all the delights of spring. The hedges are\r\n    budding, and you should see me and my friend Mrs. Williams poking\r\n    about for violets by the sides of dry ditches; she being herself--\r\n\r\n      A violet by a mossy stone\r\n      Half hidden from the eye.\r\n\r\n    Yesterday a countryman seeing our dilemma, since the ditch was not\r\n    quite dry, insisted on gathering them for us, and when we resisted,\r\n    saying that we had no _quattrini_ (_i.e._ farthings, being the generic\r\n    name for all money), he indignantly exclaimed, _Oh! se lo faccio per\r\n    interesse!_ How I wish you were with us in our rambles! Our good\r\n    cavaliers flock together, and as they do not like _fetching a walk\r\n    with the absurd womankind_, Jane (_i.e._ Mrs. Williams) and I are off\r\n    together, and talk morality and pluck violets by the way. I look\r\n    forward to many duets with this lady and Hunt. She has a very pretty\r\n    voice, and a taste and ear for music which is almost miraculous. The\r\n    harp is her favourite instrument; but we have none, and a very bad\r\n    piano; however, as it is, we pass very pleasant evenings, though I can\r\n    hardly bear to hear her sing \"Donne l'amore\"; it transports me so\r\n    entirely back to your little parlour at Hampstead--and I see the\r\n    piano, the bookcase, the prints, the casts--and hear Mary's\r\n    _far-ha-ha-a_!\r\n\r\n    We are in great uncertainty as to where we shall spend the summer.\r\n    There is a beautiful bay about fifty miles off, and as we have\r\n    resolved on the sea, Shelley bought a boat. We wished very much to go\r\n    there; perhaps we shall still, but as yet we can find but one house;\r\n    but as we are a colony \"which moves altogether or not at all,\" we have\r\n    not yet made up our minds. The apartments which we have prepared for\r\n    you in Lord Byron's house will be very warm for the summer; and indeed\r\n    for the two hottest months I should think that you had better go into\r\n    the country. Villas about here are tolerably cheap, and they are\r\n    perfect paradises. Perhaps, as it was with me, Italy will not strike\r\n    you as so divine at first; but each day it becomes dearer and more\r\n    delightful; the sun, the flowers, the air, all is more sweet and more\r\n    balmy than in the _Ultima Thule_ that you inhabit.\r\n\r\n      M. W. S.\r\n\r\nThe journal for the next few weeks has nothing eventful to record. The\r\npreceding letter to Mrs. Hunt gives a simple and pleasing picture of their\r\ndaily life. Perhaps Mary had never been quite so happy before; she wrote\r\nto the Hunts that she thought she grew younger. Both she and Shelley were\r\noccasionally ailing, and Shelley's letters show that his spirits suffered\r\ndepression at times, still, in this respect as well as in health, he was\r\nbetter than he had been in any former spring. The proximity of Byron and\r\nhis circle was not, however, favourable to inspiration or to literary\r\ncomposition. Byron's temperament acted as a damper to enthusiasm in\r\nothers, and Shelley, though his estimate of Byron's genius was very high,\r\nwas perpetually jarred and crossed by his worldliness and his moral\r\nshallowness and vulgarity. He invariably, acted, however, as Byron's true\r\nand disinterested friend; and Byron was fully aware of the value of his\r\nfriendship and of his literary help and criticism.\r\n\r\nTrelawny, to whom Byron had taken kindly enough, estimated the difference\r\nin the moral worth of the two poets with singular justice.\r\n\r\n    \"I believed in many things then, and believe in some now,\" he wrote,\r\n    more than five and thirty years afterwards: \"I could not sympathise\r\n    with Byron, who believed in nothing.\"\r\n\r\nHis friendship for Byron, nevertheless, was to be loyal and lasting. But\r\nhis favourite resort in these Pisan days was the \"hospitable and cheerful\r\nabode of the Shelleys.\"\r\n\r\n    \"There,\" he says, \"I found those sympathies and sentiments which the\r\n    Pilgrim denounced as illusions, believed in as the only realities.\"\r\n\r\nAt Byron's social gatherings--riding-parties or dinner-parties--he made a\r\npoint of getting Shelley if he could; and Shelley was very compliant,\r\nalthough the society of which Byron was the nucleus was neither congenial\r\nnor interesting to him, and he always took the first good opportunity of\r\nescaping. Daily intercourse of this kind tended gradually to estrange\r\nrather than unite the two poets: by accentuating differences it brought\r\ninto evidence that gulf between their natures which, in spite of the one\r\ntouch of kinship that certainly existed, was equally impassable by one and\r\nby the other. Besides, the subject of Clare and Allegra, never far below\r\nthe surface, would occasionally come up, and this was a sore point on both\r\nsides. As has already been said, Byron appreciated Shelley, though he did\r\nnot sympathise with him. In after days he bore public testimony to the\r\npurity and unselfishness of Shelley's character and to the upright and\r\ndisinterested motives which actuated him in all he did. But his respect\r\nfor Shelley was not so strong as his antipathy to Clare, and Shelley's\r\nfeeling towards her was regarded by him with a cynical sneer which he had\r\nno care to hide, and of which its object could not always be unconscious.\r\nIt is not wonderful that at times there swept across Shelley's mind, like\r\na black cloud, the conviction that neither a sense of honour nor justice\r\nrestrained Byron from the basest insinuations. And then again this\r\nsuspicion would pass away as too dreadful to be entertained.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Clare, in the pursuit of her newly-adopted profession, was\r\nthinking of going to Vienna, and she longed for a sight of her child\r\nfirst. She had been unusually long, or she fancied so, without news of\r\nAllegra, and she was growing desperately anxious,--with only too good\r\ncause, as the event showed. She wrote to Byron, entreating him to arrange\r\nfor a visit or an interview. Byron took no notice of her letters. The\r\nShelleys dared not annoy him unnecessarily on the subject, as he had been\r\nheard to threaten if they did so to immure Allegra in some secret convent\r\nwhere no one could get at her or even hear of her. Clare, working herself\r\nup into a state of half-frenzied excitement, sent them letter after\r\nletter, suggesting and urging wild plans (which Shelley was to realise)\r\nfor carrying off the child by armed force; indeed, one of her schemes\r\nseems to have been to take advantage of the projected interview, if\r\ngranted, for putting this design into execution. Some such proposed breach\r\nof faith must have been the occasion of Shelley's answering her--\r\n\r\n    I know not what to think of the state of your mind, or what to fear\r\n    for you. Your late plan about Allegra seems to me in its present form\r\n    pregnant with irremediable infamy to all the actors in it except\r\n    yourself.\r\n\r\nHe did not think that in her present excited mental condition she was fit\r\nto go to Vienna, and he entreated her to postpone the idea. His advice,\r\noften repeated in different words, was, that she should not lose herself\r\nin distant and uncertain plans, but \"systematise and simplify\" her\r\nmotions, at least for the present, and, if she felt in the least disposed,\r\nthat she should come and stay with them--\r\n\r\n    If you like, come and look for houses with me in our boat; it might\r\n    distract your mind.\r\n\r\nHe and Mary had resolved to quit Pisa as soon as the weather made it\r\ndesirable to do so; but their plans and their anxieties were alike\r\nsuspended by a temporary excitement of which Mary's account is given in\r\nthe following letter--\r\n\r\n    MRS. SHELLEY TO MRS. GISBORNE.\r\n\r\n    PISA, _6th April 1822_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MRS. GISBORNE--Not many days after I had written to you\r\n    concerning the fate which ever pursues us at spring-tide, a\r\n    circumstance happened which showed that we were not forgotten this\r\n    year. Although, indeed, now that it is all over, I begin to fear that\r\n    the King of Gods and men will not consider it a sufficiently heavy\r\n    visitation, although for a time it threatened to be frightful enough.\r\n    Two Sundays ago, Lord Byron, Shelley, Trelawny, Captain Hay, Count\r\n    Gamba, and Taafe were returning from their usual evening ride, when,\r\n    near the Porta della Piazza, they were passed by a soldier who\r\n    galloped through the midst of them knocking up against Taafe. This\r\n    nice little gentleman exclaimed, \"Shall we endure this man's\r\n    insolence?\" Lord Byron replied, \"No! we will bring him to an account,\"\r\n    and Shelley (whose blood always boils at any insolence offered by a\r\n    soldier) added, \"As you please!\" so they put spurs to their horses\r\n    (_i.e._ all but Taafe, who remained quietly behind), followed and\r\n    stopped the man, and, fancying that he was an officer, demanded his\r\n    name and address, and gave their cards. The man who, I believe, was\r\n    half drunk, replied only by all the oaths and abuse in which the\r\n    Italian language is so rich. He ended by saying, \"If I liked I could\r\n    draw my sabre and cut you all to pieces, but as it is, I only arrest\r\n    you,\" and he called out to the guards at the gate _arrestategli_. Lord\r\n    Byron laughed at this, and saying _arrestateci pure_, gave spurs to\r\n    his horse and rode towards the gate, followed by the rest. Lord Byron\r\n    and Gamba passed, but before the others could, the soldier got under\r\n    the gateway, called on the guard to stop them, and drawing his sabre,\r\n    began to cut at them. It happened that I and the Countess Guiccioli\r\n    were in a carriage close behind and saw it all, and you may guess how\r\n    frightened we were when we saw our cavaliers cut at, they being\r\n    totally unarmed. Their only safety was, that the field of battle being\r\n    so confined, they got close under the man, and were able to arrest his\r\n    arm. Captain Hay was, however, wounded in his face, and Shelley thrown\r\n    from his horse. I cannot tell you how it all ended, but after cutting\r\n    and slashing a little, the man sheathed his sword and rode on, while\r\n    the others got from their horses to assist poor Hay, who was faint\r\n    from loss of blood. Lord Byron, when he had passed the gate, rode to\r\n    his own house, got a sword-stick from one of his servants, and was\r\n    returning to the gate, Lung' Arno, when he met this man, who held out\r\n    his hand saying, _Siete contento?_ Lord Byron replied, \"No! I must\r\n    know your name, that I may require satisfaction of you.\" The soldier\r\n    said, _Il mio nome e Masi, sono sargente maggiore_, etc. etc. While\r\n    they were talking, a servant of Lord Byron's came and took hold of the\r\n    bridle of the sergeant's horse. Lord Byron ordered him to let it go,\r\n    and immediately the man put his horse to a gallop, but, passing Casa\r\n    Lanfranchi, one of Lord Byron's servants thought that he had killed\r\n    his master and was running away; determining that he should not go\r\n    scot-free, he ran at him with a pitchfork and wounded him. The man\r\n    rode on a few paces, cried out, _Sono ammazzato_, and fell, was\r\n    carried to the hospital, the Misericordia bell ringing. We were all\r\n    assembled at Casa Lanfranchi, nursing our wounded man, and poor\r\n    Teresa, from the excess of her fright, was worse than any, when what\r\n    was our consternation when we heard that the man's wound was\r\n    considered mortal! Luckily none but ourselves knew who had given the\r\n    wound; it was said by the wise Pisani, to have been one of Lord\r\n    Byron's servants, set on by his padrone, and they pitched upon a poor\r\n    fellow merely because _aveva lo sguardo fiero, quanto un assassino_.\r\n    For some days Masi continued in great danger, but he is now\r\n    recovering. As long as it was thought he would die, the Government did\r\n    nothing; but now that he is nearly well, they have imprisoned two\r\n    men, one of Lord Byron's servants (the one with the _sguardo fiero_),\r\n    and the other a servant of Teresa's, who was behind our carriage, both\r\n    perfectly innocent, but they have been kept _in segreto_ these ten\r\n    days, and God knows when they will be let out. What think you of this?\r\n    Will it serve for our spring adventure? It is blown over now, it is\r\n    true, but our fate has, in general, been in common with Dame Nature,\r\n    and March winds and April showers have brought forth May flowers.\r\n\r\n    You have no notion what a ridiculous figure Taafe cut in all this--he\r\n    kept far behind during the danger, but the next day he wished to take\r\n    all the honour to himself, vowed that all Pisa talked of him alone,\r\n    and coming to Lord Byron said, \"My Lord, if you do not dare ride out\r\n    to-day, I will alone.\" But the next day he again changed, he was\r\n    afraid of being turned out of Tuscany, or of being obliged to fight\r\n    with one of the officers of the sergeant's regiment, of neither of\r\n    which things there was the slightest danger, so he wrote a declaration\r\n    to the Governor to say that he had nothing to do with it; so\r\n    embroiling himself with Lord Byron, he got between Scylla and\r\n    Charybdis, from which he has not yet extricated himself; for\r\n    ourselves, we do not fear any ulterior consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _10th April._\r\n\r\n    We received _Hellas_ to-day, and the bill of lading. Shelley is well\r\n    pleased with the former, though there are some mistakes. The only\r\n    danger would arise from the vengeance of Masi, but the moment he is\r\n    able to move, he is to be removed to another town; he is a _pessimo\r\n    soggetto_, being the crony of Soldaini, Rosselmini, and Augustini,\r\n    Pisan names of evil fame, which, perhaps, you may remember. There is\r\n    only one consolation in all this, that if it be our fate to suffer, it\r\n    is more agreeable, and more safe to suffer in company with five or six\r\n    than alone. Well! after telling you this long story, I must relate our\r\n    other news. And first, the Greek Ali Pashaw is dead, and his head sent\r\n    to Constantinople; the reception of it was celebrated there by the\r\n    massacre of four thousand Greeks. The latter, however, get on. The\r\n    Turkish fleet of 25 sail of the line-of-war vessels, and 40\r\n    transports, endeavoured to surprise the Greek fleet in its winter\r\n    quarters; finding them prepared, they bore away for Lante, and pursued\r\n    by the Greeks, took refuge in the bay of Naupacto. Here they first\r\n    blockaded them, and obtained a complete victory. All the soldiers on\r\n    board the transports, in endeavouring to land, were cut to pieces, and\r\n    the fleet taken or destroyed. I heard something about Hellenists which\r\n    greatly pleased me. When any one asks of the peasants of the Morea\r\n    what news there is, and if they have had any victory, they reply: \"I\r\n    do not know, but for us it is [Greek: e tan, e epi tas],\" being their\r\n    Doric pronunciation of [Greek: e tan, e epi tes], the speech of the\r\n    Spartan mother, on presenting his shield to her son; \"With this or on\r\n    this.\"\r\n\r\n    I wish, my dear Mrs. Gisborne, that you would send the first part of\r\n    this letter, addressed to Mr. W. Godwin at Nash's, Esq., Dover Street.\r\n    I wish him to have an account of the fray, and you will thus save me\r\n    the trouble of writing it over again, for what with writing and\r\n    talking about it, I am quite tired. In a late letter of mine to my\r\n    father, I requested him to send you _Matilda_. I hope that he has\r\n    complied with my desire, and, in that case, that you will get it\r\n    copied and send it to me by the first opportunity, perhaps by Hunt, if\r\n    he comes at all. I do not mention commissions to you, for although\r\n    wishing much for the things about which I wrote [we have], for the\r\n    present, no money to spare. We wish very much to hear from you again,\r\n    and to hear if there are any hopes of your getting on in your plans,\r\n    what Henry is doing, and how you continue to like England. The months\r\n    of February and March were with us as hot as an English June. In the\r\n    first days of April we have had some very cold weather; so that we are\r\n    obliged to light fires again. Shelley has been much better in health\r\n    this winter than any other since I have known him, Pisa certainly\r\n    agrees with him exceedingly well, which is its only merit, in my eyes.\r\n    I wish fate had bound us to Naples instead. Percy is quite well; he\r\n    begins to talk, Italian only now, and to call things _bello_ and\r\n    _buono_, but the droll thing is, that he is right about the genders.\r\n    A silk _vestito_ is _bello_, but a new _frusta_ is _bella_. He is a\r\n    fine boy, full of life, and very pretty. Williams is very well, and\r\n    they are getting on very well. Mrs. Williams is a miracle of economy,\r\n    and, as Mrs. Godwin used to call it, makes both ends meet with great\r\n    comfort to herself and others. Medwin is gone to Rome; we have heaps\r\n    of the gossip of a petty town this winter, being just in the _coterie_\r\n    where it was all carried on; but now _Grazie a Messer Domenedio_, the\r\n    English are almost all gone, and we, being left alone, all subjects of\r\n    discord and clacking cease. You may conceive what a _bisbiglio_ our\r\n    adventure made. The Pisans were all enraged because the _maledetti\r\n    inglesi_ were not punished; yet when the gentlemen returned from their\r\n    ride the following day (busy fate) an immense crowd was assembled\r\n    before Casa Lanfranchi, and they all took off their hats to them.\r\n    Adieu. _State bene e felice._ Best remembrances to Mr. Gisborne, and\r\n    compliments to Henry, who will remember Hay as one of the Maremma\r\n    hunters; he is a friend of Lord Byron's.--Yours ever truly,\r\n\r\n      MARY W. S.\r\n\r\nThis affair, and the consequent inquiry and examination of witnesses in\r\nconnection with it took up several days, on one of which Mary and Countess\r\nGuiccioli were under examination for five hours.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Byron decided to go to Leghorn for his summer boating;\r\nwhereupon Shelley wrote and definitively proposed to Clare that she should\r\naccompany his party to Spezzia, promising her quiet and privacy, and\r\nimmunity from annoyance, while she bided her time with regard to Allegra.\r\nClare accepted the offer, and joined them at Pisa on the 15th of April in\r\nthe expectation of starting very shortly. It turned out, however, that no\r\nsuitable houses were, after all, to be had on the coast. This was an\r\nunexpected disappointment, and on the 23d she and the Williams' went off\r\nto Spezzia for another search. They were hardly on their way when letters\r\nwere received by Shelley and Mary with the grievous news that Allegra had\r\ndied of typhus fever in the convent of Bagnacavallo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nAPRIL-JULY 1882\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Evil news. Not well.\"\r\n\r\nThese few words are Mary's record of this frightful blow. She was again in\r\ndelicate health, suffering from the same depressing symptoms as before\r\nPercy's birth, and for a like reason.\r\n\r\nNo wonder she was made downright ill by the shock, and by the sickening\r\napprehension of the scene to follow when Clare should hear the news.\r\n\r\nOn the next day but one--the 25th of April--the travellers returned.\r\n\r\nWilliams says, in his diary for that day--\r\n\r\n    Meet S., his face bespoke his feelings. C.'s child was dead, and he\r\n    had the office to break it to her, or rather not to do so; but,\r\n    fearful of the news reaching her ears, to remove her instantly from\r\n    this place.\r\n\r\nShelley could not tell Clare at once. Not while they were in Pisa, and\r\nwith Byron close by. One, unfurnished, house was to be had, the Casa\r\nMagni, in the Bay of Lerici. Thither, on the chance of getting it, they\r\nmust go, and instantly. Mary's indisposition must be ignored; she must\r\nundertake the negotiations for the house. Within twenty-four hours she was\r\noff to Spezzia, with Clare and little Percy, escorted by Trelawny; poor\r\nClare quite unconscious of the burden on her friends' minds. Shelley\r\nremained behind another day, to pack up the necessary furniture; but, on\r\nthe 27th, he with the whole Williams family left Pisa for Lerici. Thence,\r\nwhile waiting for the furniture to arrive by sea, he wrote to Mary at\r\nSpezzia.\r\n\r\n    SHELLEY TO MARY.\r\n\r\n    LERICI, _Sunday, 28th April 1822_.\r\n\r\n    DEAREST MARY--I am this moment arrived at Lerici, where I am\r\n    necessarily detained, waiting the furniture, which left Pisa last\r\n    night at midnight, and as the sea has been calm and the wind fair, I\r\n    may expect them every moment. It would not do to leave affairs here in\r\n    an _impiccio_, great as is my anxiety to see you. How are you, my best\r\n    love? How have you sustained the trials of the journey? Answer me this\r\n    question, and how my little babe and Clare are. Now to business--\r\n\r\n    Is the Magni House taken? if not, pray occupy yourself instantly in\r\n    finishing the affair, even if you are obliged to go to Sarzana, and\r\n    send a messenger to me to tell me of your success. I, of course,\r\n    cannot leave Lerici, to which port the boats (for we were obliged to\r\n    take two) are directed. But _you_ can come over in the same boat that\r\n    brings you this letter, and return in the evening. I hear that\r\n    Trelawny is still with you. Tell Clare that, as I must probably in a\r\n    few days return to Pisa for the affair of the lawsuit, I have brought\r\n    her box with me, thinking she might be in want of some of its\r\n    contents.\r\n\r\n    I ought to say that I do not think there is accommodation for you all\r\n    at this inn; and that, even if there were, you would be better off at\r\n    Spezzia; but if the Magni House is taken, then there is no possible\r\n    reason why you should not take a row over in the boat that will bring\r\n    this; but do not keep the men long. I am anxious to hear from you on\r\n    every account.--Ever yours,\r\n\r\n      S.\r\n\r\nMary's answer was that she had concluded for Casa Magni, but that no other\r\nhouse was to be had in all that neighbourhood. It was in a neglected\r\ncondition, and not very roomy or convenient; but, such as it was, it had\r\nto accommodate the Williams', as well as the Shelleys, and Clare.\r\nConsiderable difficulty was experienced by Shelley in obtaining leave for\r\nthe landing of the furniture; this obstacle got over, they at last took\r\npossession.\r\n\r\n    EDWARD WILLIAMS' JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, May 1._--Cloudy, with rain. Came to Casa Magni after\r\n    breakfast, the Shelleys having contrived to give us rooms. Without\r\n    them, heaven knows what we should have done. Employed all day putting\r\n    the things away. All comfortably settled by 4. Passed the evening in\r\n    talking over our folly and our troubles.\r\n\r\nThe worst trouble, however, was still impending. Finding how crowded and\r\nuncomfortable they were likely to be, Clare, after a day or two, decided\r\nthat it was best for herself and for every one that she should return to\r\nFlorence, and announced her intention accordingly. Compelled by the\r\ncircumstances, Shelley then disclosed to her the true state of the case.\r\nHer grief was excessive, but was, after the first, succeeded by a calmness\r\nunusual in her and surprising to her friends; a reaction from the fever\r\nof suspense and torment in which she had lived for weeks past, and which\r\nwere even a harder strain on her powers of endurance than the truth,\r\ngrievous though that was, putting an end to all hope as well as to all\r\nfear. For the present she remained at the Villa Magni.\r\n\r\n    The ground floor of this habitation was appropriated, as is often done\r\n    in Italy, for stowing the implements and produce of the land, as rent\r\n    is paid in kind there. In the autumn you find casks of wine, jars of\r\n    oil, tools, wood, occasionally carts, and, near the sea, boats and\r\n    fishing-nets. Over this floor were a large saloon and four bedrooms\r\n    (which had once been whitewashed), and nothing more; there was an\r\n    out-building for cooking, and a place for the servants to eat and\r\n    sleep in. The Williams had one room, and Shelley and his wife occupied\r\n    two more, facing each other.[47]\r\n\r\nFacing the sea, and almost over it, a verandah or open terrace ran the\r\nwhole length of the building; it was over the projecting ground floor, and\r\nlevel with the inhabited story.\r\n\r\nThe surrounding scenery was magnificent, but wild to the last degree, and\r\nthere was something unearthly in the perpetual moaning and howling of\r\nwinds and waves. Poor Mary now began to feel the ill effects of her\r\nenforced over-exertions. She became very unwell, suffering from utter\r\nprostration of strength and from hysterical affections. Rest, quiet, and\r\nfreedom from worry were essential to her condition, but none of these\r\ncould she have, nor even sleep at night. The absence of comfort and\r\nprivacy, added to the great difficulty of housekeeping, and the melancholy\r\nwith which Clare's misfortune had infected the whole party, were all very\r\nunfavourable to her.\r\n\r\nAfter staying for three weeks, Clare returned for a short visit to\r\nFlorence. Shelley's letters to her during her absence afford occasional\r\nglimpses, from which it is easy to infer more, into the state of affairs\r\nat Casa Magni. Mrs. Williams was \"by no means acquiescent in the present\r\nsystem of things.\" The plan of having all possessions in common does not\r\nwork well in the kitchen; the respective servants of the two families were\r\nalways quarrelling and taking each other's things. Jane, who was a good\r\nhousekeeper, had the defects of her qualities, and \"pined for her own\r\nhouse and saucepans.\" \"It is a pity,\" remarks Shelley, \"that any one so\r\npretty and amiable should be so selfish.\" Not that these matters troubled\r\nhim much. Such little \"squalls\" gave way to calm, \"in accustomed\r\nvicissitude\" (to use his own words); and Mrs. Williams had far too much\r\ntact to dwell on domestic worries to him. His own nerves were for a time\r\nshaken and unstrung, but he recovered, and, after the first, was unusually\r\nwell. He was in love with the wild, beautiful place, and with the life at\r\nsea; for to his boat he escaped whenever any little breezes ruffled the\r\nsurface of domestic life so that its mirror no longer reflected his own\r\nunwontedly bright spirits. At first he and Williams had only the small\r\nflat-bottomed boat in which they had navigated the Arno and Serchio, but\r\nin a fortnight there arrived the little schooner which Captain Roberts had\r\nbuilt for Shelley at Genoa, and then their content was perfect.\r\n\r\nFor Mary no such escape from care and discomfort was open; she was too\r\nweak to go about much, and it is no wonder that, after the Williams'\r\ninstallation, she merely chronicles, \"The rest of May a blank.\"\r\n\r\nWilliams' diary partly fills this blank; and it is so graphic in its\r\nexceeding simplicity that, though it has been printed before, portions may\r\nwell be included here.\r\n\r\n    EXTRACTS FROM WILLIAMS' DIARY.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, May 2._--Cloudy, with intervals of rain. Went out with\r\n    Shelley in the boat--fish on the rocks--bad sport. Went in the evening\r\n    after some wild ducks--saw nothing but sublime scenery, to which the\r\n    grandeur of a storm greatly contributed.\r\n\r\n    _Friday, May 3._--Fine. The captain of the port despatched a vessel\r\n    for Shelley's boat. Went to Lerici with S., being obliged to market\r\n    there; the servant having returned from Sarzana without being able to\r\n    procure anything.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, May 5._--Fine. Kept awake the whole night by a heavy swell,\r\n    which made a noise on the beach like the discharge of heavy artillery.\r\n    Tried with Shelley to launch the small flat-bottomed boat through the\r\n    surf; we succeeded in pushing it through, but shipped a sea on\r\n    attempting to land. Walk to Lerici along the beach, by a winding path\r\n    on the mountain's side. Delightful evening,--the scenery most sublime.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, May 6._--Fine. Some heavy drops of rain fell to-day, without\r\n    a cloud being visible. Made a sketch of the western side of the bay.\r\n    Read a little. Walked with Jane up the mountain.\r\n\r\n    After tea walking with Shelley on the terrace, and observing the\r\n    effect of moonshine on the waters, he complained of being unusually\r\n    nervous, and stopping short, he grasped me violently by the arm, and\r\n    stared steadfastly on the white surf that broke upon the beach under\r\n    our feet. Observing him sensibly affected, I demanded of him if he\r\n    were in pain. But he only answered by saying, \"There it is\r\n    again--there\"! He recovered after some time, and declared that he saw,\r\n    as plainly as he then saw me, a naked child (Allegra) rise from the\r\n    sea, and clap its hands as in joy, smiling at him. This was a trance\r\n    that it required some reasoning and philosophy entirely to awaken him\r\n    from, so forcibly had the vision operated on his mind. Our\r\n    conversation, which had been at first rather melancholy, led to this;\r\n    and my confirming his sensations, by confessing that I had felt the\r\n    same, gave greater activity to his ever-wandering and lively\r\n    imagination.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, May 12._--Cloudy and threatening weather. Wrote during the\r\n    morning. Mr. Maglian called after dinner, and, while walking with him\r\n    on the terrace, we discovered a strange sail coming round the point of\r\n    Porto Venere, which proved at length to be Shelley's boat. She had\r\n    left Genoa on Thursday, but had been driven back by prevailing bad\r\n    winds, a Mr. Heslop and two English seamen brought her round, and they\r\n    speak most highly of her performances. She does, indeed, excite my\r\n    surprise and admiration. Shelley and I walked to Lerici, and made a\r\n    stretch off the land to try her, and I find she fetches whatever she\r\n    looks at. In short, we have now a perfect plaything for the summer.\r\n\r\n    _Monday, May 13._--Rain during night in torrents--a heavy gale of wind\r\n    from S.W., and a surf running heavier than ever; at 4 gale unabated,\r\n    violent squalls....\r\n\r\n    ... In the evening an electric arch forming in the clouds announces a\r\n    heavy thunderstorm, if the wind lulls. Distant thunder--gale\r\n    increases--a circle of foam surrounds the bay--dark, evening, and\r\n    tempestuous, with flashes of lightning at intervals, which give us no\r\n    hope of better weather. The learned in these things say, that it\r\n    generally lasts three days when once it commences as this has done. We\r\n    all feel as if we were on board ship--and the roaring of the sea\r\n    brings this idea to us even in our beds.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, May 15._--Fine and fresh breeze in puffs from the land.\r\n    Jane and Mary consent to take a sail. Run down to Porto Venere and\r\n    beat back at 1 o'clock. The boat sailed like a witch. After the late\r\n    gale, the water is covered with purple nautili, or as the sailors call\r\n    them, Portuguese men-of-war. After dinner Jane accompanied us to the\r\n    point of the Magra; and the boat beat back in wonderful style.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, May 22._--Fine, after a threatening night. After breakfast\r\n    Shelley and I amused ourselves with trying to make a boat of canvas\r\n    and reeds, as light and as small as possible. She is to be 8-1/2 feet\r\n    long, and 4-1/2 broad....\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday, June 12._--Launched the little boat, which answered our\r\n    wishes and expectations. She is 86 lbs. English weight, and stows\r\n    easily on board. Sailed in the evening, but were becalmed in the\r\n    offing, and left there with a long ground swell, which made Jane\r\n    little better than dead. Hoisted out our little boat and brought her\r\n    on shore. Her landing attended by the whole village.\r\n\r\n    _Thursday, June 13._--Fine. At 9 saw a vessel between the straits of\r\n    Porto Venere, like a man-of-war brig. She proved to be the _Bolivar_,\r\n    with Roberts and Trelawny on board, who are taking her round to\r\n    Livorno. On meeting them we were saluted by six guns. Sailed together\r\n    to try the vessels--in speed no chance with her, but I think we keep\r\n    as good a wind. She is the most beautiful craft I ever saw, and will\r\n    do more for her size. She costs Lord Byron L750 clear off and ready\r\n    for sea, with provisions and conveniences of every kind.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this happy life one anxiety there was, however, which\r\npursued Shelley everywhere; and neither on shore nor at sea could he\r\nescape from it,--that of Godwin's imminent ruin.\r\n\r\nThe first of the letters which follow had reached Mary while still at\r\nPisa. The next letter, and that of Mrs. Godwin were, at Shelley's request,\r\nintercepted by Mrs. Mason and sent to him. He could not and would not show\r\nthem to Mary, and wrote at last to Mrs. Godwin, to try and put a stop to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n    GODWIN TO MARY.\r\n\r\n    SKINNER STREET, _19th April 1822_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST MARY--The die, so far as I am concerned, seems now to be\r\n    cast, and all that remains is that I should entreat you to forget that\r\n    you have a father in existence. Why should your prime of youthful\r\n    vigour be tarnished and made wretched by what relates to me? I have\r\n    lived to the full age of man in as much comfort as can reasonably be\r\n    expected to fall to the lot of a human being. What signifies what\r\n    becomes of the few wretched years that remain?\r\n\r\n    For the same reason, I think I ought for the future to drop writing to\r\n    you. It is impossible that my letters can give you anything but\r\n    unmingled pain. A few weeks more, and the formalities which still\r\n    restrain the successful claimant will be over, and my prospects of\r\n    tranquillity must, as I believe, be eternally closed.--Farewell,\r\n\r\n      WILLIAM GODWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GODWIN TO MARY.\r\n\r\n    SKINNER STREET, _3d May 1822_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MARY--I wrote to you a fortnight ago, and professed my intention\r\n    of not writing again. I certainly will not write when the result shall\r\n    be to give pure, unmitigated pain. It is the questionable shape of\r\n    what I have to communicate that still thrusts the pen into my hand.\r\n    This day we are compelled, by summary process, to leave the house we\r\n    live in, and to hide our heads in whatever alley will receive us. If\r\n    we can compound with our creditor, and he seems not unwilling to\r\n    accept L400 (I have talked with him on the subject), we may emerge\r\n    again. Our business, if freed from this intolerable burthen, is more\r\n    than ever worth keeping.\r\n\r\n    But all this would, perhaps, have failed in inducing me to resume the\r\n    pen, but for _one extraordinary accident_. Wednesday, 1st May, was the\r\n    day when the last legal step was taken against me; and Wednesday\r\n    morning, a few hours before this catastrophe, Willats, the man who,\r\n    three or four years before, lent Shelley L2000 at two for one, called\r\n    on me to ask whether Shelley wanted any more money on the same terms.\r\n    What does this mean? In the contemplation of such a coincidence, I\r\n    could almost grow superstitious. But, alas! I fear--I fear--I am a\r\n    drowning man, catching at a straw.--Ever most affectionately, your\r\n    father,\r\n\r\n      WILLIAM GODWIN.\r\n\r\n    Please to direct your letters, till you hear further, to the care of\r\n    Mr. Monro, No. 60 Skinner Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MRS. MASON TO SHELLEY.\r\n\r\n    _May 1822._\r\n\r\n    I send you in return for Godwin's letter one still worse, because I\r\n    think it has more the appearance of truth. I was desired to convey it\r\n    to Mary, but that I should not think right. At the same time, I don't\r\n    well know how you can conceal all this affair from her; they really\r\n    seem to want assistance at present, for their being turned out of the\r\n    house is a serious evil. I rejoice in your good health, to which I\r\n    have no doubt the boat and the Williams' much contribute, and wish\r\n    there may be no prospect of its being disturbed.\r\n\r\n    Mary ought to know what is said of the novel, and how can she know\r\n    that without all the rest? You will contrive what is best. In the part\r\n    of the letter which I do send, she (Mrs. Godwin) adds, that at this\r\n    moment Mr. Godwin does not offer the novel to any bookseller, lest his\r\n    actual situation might make it be supposed that it would be sold\r\n    cheap. Mrs. Godwin also wishes to correspond directly with Mrs.\r\n    Shelley, but this I shall not permit; she says Godwin's health is much\r\n    the worse for all this affair.\r\n\r\n    I was astonished at seeing Clare walk in on Tuesday evening, and I\r\n    have not a spare bed now in the house, the children having outgrown\r\n    theirs, and been obliged to occupy that which I had formerly; she\r\n    proposed going to an inn, but preferred sleeping on a sofa, where I\r\n    made her as comfortable as I could, which is but little so; however,\r\n    she is satisfied. I rejoice to see that she has not suffered so much\r\n    as you expected, and understand now her former feelings better than at\r\n    first. When there is nothing to hope or fear, it is natural to be\r\n    calm. I wish she had some determined project, but her plans seem as\r\n    unsettled as ever, and she does not see half the reasons for\r\n    separating herself from your society that really exist. I regret to\r\n    perceive her great repugnance to Paris, which I believe to be the\r\n    place best adapted to her. If she had but the temptation of good\r\n    letters of introduction!--but I have no means of obtaining them for\r\n    her--she intends, I believe, to go to Florence to-morrow, and to\r\n    return to your habitation in a week, but talks of not staying the\r\n    whole summer. I regret the loss of Mary's good health and spirits, but\r\n    hope it is only the consequence of her present situation, and,\r\n    therefore, merely temporary, but I dread Clare's being in the same\r\n    house for a month or two, and wish the Williams' were half a mile from\r\n    you. I must write a few lines to Mary, but will say nothing of having\r\n    heard from Mrs. Godwin; you will tell her what you think right, but\r\n    you know my opinion, that things which cannot be concealed are better\r\n    told at once. I should suppose a bankruptcy would be best, but the\r\n    Godwins do not seem to think so. If all the world valued obscure\r\n    tranquillity as much as I do, it would be a happier, though possibly\r\n    much duller, world than it is, but the loss of wealth is quite an\r\n    epidemic disease in England, and it disturbs their rest more than\r\n    the[48] ... I should have a thousand things to say, but that I have a\r\n    thousand other things to do, and you give me hope of conversing with\r\n    you before long.--Ever yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\n      M. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SHELLEY TO MRS. GODWIN.\r\n\r\n    LERICI, _29th May 1882_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MADAM--Mrs. Mason has sent me an extract from your last letter to\r\n    show to Mary, and I have received that of Mr. Godwin, in which he\r\n    mentions your having left Skinner Street.\r\n\r\n    In Mary's present state of health and spirits, much caution is\r\n    requisite with regard to communications which must agitate her in the\r\n    highest degree, and the object of my present letter is simply to\r\n    inform you that I thought it right to exercise this caution on the\r\n    present occasion. Mary is at present about three months advanced in\r\n    pregnancy, and the irritability and languor which accompany this state\r\n    are always distressing, and sometimes alarming. I do not know even how\r\n    soon I can permit her to receive such communications, or even how soon\r\n    you or Mr. Godwin would wish they should be conveyed to her, if you\r\n    could have any idea of the effect. Do not, however, let me be\r\n    misunderstood. It is not my intention or my wish that the\r\n    circumstances in which your family is involved should be concealed\r\n    from her; but that the detail of them should be suspended until they\r\n    assume a more prosperous character, or at least till letters addressed\r\n    to her or intended for her perusal on that subject should not convey a\r\n    supposition that she could do more than she does, thus exasperating\r\n    the sympathy which she already feels too intensely for her Father's\r\n    distress, which she would sacrifice all she possesses to remedy, but\r\n    the remedy of which is beyond her power. She imagined that her novel\r\n    might be turned to immediate advantage for him. I am greatly\r\n    interested in the fate of this production, which appears to me to\r\n    possess a high degree of merit, and I regret that it is not Mr.\r\n    Godwin's intention to publish it immediately. I am sure that Mary\r\n    would be delighted to amend anything that her Father thought imperfect\r\n    in it, though I confess that if his objection relates to the\r\n    character of Beatrice, _I_ shall lament the deference which would be\r\n    shown by the sacrifice of any portion of it to feelings and ideas\r\n    which are but for a day. I wish Mr. Godwin would write to her on that\r\n    subject; he might advert to the letter (for it is only the last one)\r\n    which I have suppressed, or not, as he thought proper.\r\n\r\n    I have written to Mr. Smith to solicit the loan of L400, which, if I\r\n    can obtain in that manner, is very much at Mr. Godwin's service. The\r\n    views which I now entertain of my affairs forbid me to enter into any\r\n    further reversionary transactions; nor do I think Mr. Godwin would be\r\n    a gainer by the contrary determination; as it would be next to\r\n    impossible to effectuate any such bargain at this distance, nor could\r\n    I burthen my income, which is only sufficient to meet its various\r\n    claims, and the system of life in which it seems necessary I should\r\n    live.\r\n\r\n    We hear you hear Jane's (Clare's) news from Mrs. Mason. Since the late\r\n    melancholy event she has become far more tranquil; nor should I have\r\n    anything to desire with regard to her, did not the uncertainty of my\r\n    own life and prospects render it prudent for her to attempt to\r\n    establish some sort of independence as a security against an event\r\n    which would deprive her of that which she at present enjoys. She is\r\n    well in health, and usually resides at Florence, where she has formed\r\n    a little society for herself among the Italians, with whom she is a\r\n    great favourite. She was here for a week or two; and although she has\r\n    at present returned to Florence, we expect her on a visit to us for\r\n    the summer months. In the winter, unless some of her various plans\r\n    succeed, for she may be called _la fille aux mille projets_, she will\r\n    return to Florence. Mr. Godwin may depend upon receiving immediate\r\n    notice of the result of my application to Mr. Smith. I hope soon to\r\n    have an account of your situation and prospects, and remain, dear\r\n    Madam, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\n      P. B. SHELLEY.\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Godwin.\r\n\r\n    We will speak another time, of what is deeply interesting both to Mary\r\n    and to myself, of my dear William.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of all this on Shelley's mind,--the consciousness that he\r\nwas hiding it from Mary, and that she was probably more than half aware of\r\nhis doing so, gave him a feeling of constraint in his daily intercourse\r\nwith her. To talk with her, even about her father, was difficult, for he\r\ncould neither help nor hide his feeling of irritation and indignation at\r\nthe way in which Godwin persecuted his daughter after the efforts she had\r\nmade in his behalf, and for which he had hardly thanked her.\r\n\r\nIt would have to come, the explanation; but for the present, as Shelley\r\nwrote to Clare, he was content to put off the evil day. Towards the end of\r\nthe month Mary's health had somewhat improved, and the letter she then\r\nwrote to Mrs. Gisborne gives a connected account of all the past\r\nincidents.\r\n\r\n    MARY SHELLEY TO MRS. GISBORNE.\r\n\r\n    CASA MAGNI, Presso a LERICI,\r\n    _2d June 1822_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MRS. GISBORNE--We received a letter from Mr. Gisborne the\r\n    other day, which promised one from you. It is not yet come, and\r\n    although I think that you are two or three in my debt, yet I am good\r\n    enough to write to you again, and thus to increase your debt. Nor will\r\n    I allow you, with one letter, to take advantage of the Insolvent Act,\r\n    and thus to free yourself from all claims at once. When I last wrote,\r\n    I said that I hoped our spring visitation had come and was gone, but\r\n    this year we were not quit so easily. However, before I mention\r\n    anything else, I will finish the story of the _zuffa_ as far as it is\r\n    yet gone. I think that in my last I left the sergeant recovering; one\r\n    of Lord Byron's and one of the Guiccioli's servants in prison on\r\n    suspicion, though both were innocent. The judge or advocate, called a\r\n    Cancelliere, sent from Florence to determine the affair, dislikes the\r\n    Pisans, and, having _poca paga_, expected a present from Milordo, and\r\n    so favoured our part of the affair, was very civil, and came to our\r\n    houses to take depositions against the law. For the sake of the\r\n    lesson, Hogg should have been there to learn to cross-question. The\r\n    Cancelliere, a talkative buffoon of a Florentine, with \"mille scuse\r\n    per l'incomodo,\" asked, \"Dove fu lei la sera del 24 marzo? Andai a\r\n    spasso in carozza, fuori della Porta della Piaggia.\" A little clerk,\r\n    seated beside him, with a great pile of papers before him, now dipped\r\n    his pen in his ink-horn, and looked expectant, while the Cancelliere,\r\n    turning his eyes up to the ceiling, repeated, \"Io fui a spasso,\" etc.\r\n    This scene lasted two, four, six, hours, as it happened. In the space\r\n    of two months the depositions of fifteen people were taken, and\r\n    finding Tita (Lord Byron's servant) perfectly innocent, the\r\n    Cancelliere ordered him to be liberated, but the Pisan police took\r\n    fright at his beard. They called him \"il barbone,\" and, although it\r\n    was declared that on his exit from prison he should be shaved, they\r\n    could not tranquillise their mighty minds, but banished him. We, in\r\n    the meantime, were come to this place, so he has taken refuge with us.\r\n    He is an excellent fellow, faithful, courageous, and daring. How could\r\n    it happen that the Pisans should be frightened at such a _mirabile\r\n    mostro_ of an Italian, especially as the day he was let out of\r\n    _segreto_, and was a _largee_ in prison, he gave a feast to all his\r\n    fellow-prisoners, hiring chandeliers and plate! But poor Antonio, the\r\n    Guiccioli's servant, the meekest-hearted fellow in the world, is kept\r\n    in _segreto_; not found guilty, but punished as such,--_e chi sa_ when\r\n    he will be let out?--so rests the affair.\r\n\r\n    About a month ago Clare came to visit us at Pisa, and went with the\r\n    Williams' to find a house in the Gulf of Spezzia, when, during her\r\n    absence, the disastrous news came of the death of Allegra. She died of\r\n    a typhus fever, which had been raging in the Romagna; but no one wrote\r\n    to say it was there. She had no friends except the nuns of the\r\n    Convent, who were kind to her, I believe; but you know Italians. If\r\n    half of the Convent had died of the plague, they would never have\r\n    written to have had her removed, and so the poor child fell a\r\n    sacrifice. Lord Byron felt the loss at first bitterly; he also felt\r\n    remorse, for he felt that he had acted against everybody's counsels\r\n    and wishes, and death had stamped with truth the many and often-urged\r\n    prophecies of Clare, that the air of the Romagna, joined to the\r\n    ignorance of the Italians, would prove fatal to her. Shelley wished to\r\n    conceal the fatal news from her as long as possible, so when she\r\n    returned from Spezzia he resolved to remove thither without delay,\r\n    with so little delay that he packed me off with Clare and Percy the\r\n    very next day. She wished to return to Florence, but he persuaded her\r\n    to accompany me; the next day he packed up our goods and chattels, for\r\n    a furnished house was not to be found in this part of the world, and,\r\n    like a torrent hurrying everything in its course, he persuaded the\r\n    Williams' to do the same. They came here; but one house was to be\r\n    found for us all; it is beautifully situated on the sea-shore, under\r\n    the woody hills,--but such a place as this is! The poverty of the\r\n    people is beyond anything, yet they do not appear unhappy, but go on\r\n    in dirty content, or contented dirt, while we find it hard work to\r\n    purvey miles around for a few eatables. We were in wretched discomfort\r\n    at first, but now are in a kind of disorderly order, living from day\r\n    to day as we can. After the first day or two Clare insisted on\r\n    returning to Florence, so Shelley was obliged to disclose the truth.\r\n    You may judge of what was her first burst of grief and despair;\r\n    however she reconciled herself to her fate sooner than we expected;\r\n    and although, of course, until she form new ties, she will always\r\n    grieve, yet she is now tranquil--more tranquil than when prophesying\r\n    her disaster; she was for ever forming plans for getting her child\r\n    from a place she judged but too truly would be fatal to her. She has\r\n    now returned to Florence, and I do not know whether she will join us\r\n    again. Our colony is much smaller than we expected, which we consider\r\n    a benefit. Lord Byron remains with his train at Montenero. Trelawny\r\n    is to be the commander of his vessel, and of course will be at\r\n    Leghorn. He is at present at Genoa, awaiting the finishing of this\r\n    boat. Shelley's boat is a beautiful creature; Henry would admire her\r\n    greatly; though only 24 feet by 8 feet she is a perfect little ship,\r\n    and looks twice her size. She had one fault, she was to have been\r\n    built in partnership with Williams and Trelawny. Trelawny chose the\r\n    name of the _Don Juan_, and we acceded; but when Shelley took her\r\n    entirely on himself we changed the name to the _Ariel_. Lord Byron\r\n    chose to take fire at this, and determined that she should be called\r\n    after the Poem; wrote to Roberts to have the name painted on the\r\n    mainsail, and she arrived thus disfigured. For days and nights, full\r\n    twenty-one, did Shelley and Edward ponder on her anabaptism, and the\r\n    washing out the primeval stain. Turpentine, spirits of wine, buccata,\r\n    all were tried, and it became dappled and no more. At length the piece\r\n    had to be taken out and reefs put, so that the sail does not look\r\n    worse. I do not know what Lord Byron will say, but Lord and Poet as he\r\n    is, he could not be allowed to make a coal barge of our boat. As only\r\n    one house was to be found habitable in this gulf, the Williams' have\r\n    taken up their abode with us, and their servants and mine quarrel like\r\n    cats and dogs; and besides, you may imagine how ill a large family\r\n    agrees with my laziness, when accounts and domestic concerns come to\r\n    be talked of. _Ma pazienza._ After all the place does not suit me; the\r\n    people are _rozzi_, and speak a detestable dialect, and yet it is\r\n    better than any other Italian sea-shore north of Naples. The air is\r\n    excellent, and you may guess how much better we like it than Leghorn,\r\n    when, besides, we should have been involved in English society--a\r\n    thing we longed to get rid of at Pisa. Mr. Gisborne talks of your\r\n    going to a distant country; pray write to me in time before this takes\r\n    place, as I want a box from England first, but cannot now exactly name\r\n    its contents. I am sorry to hear you do not get on, but perhaps Henry\r\n    will, and make up for all. Percy is well, and Shelley singularly so;\r\n    this incessant boating does him a great deal of good. I have been\r\n    very unwell for some time past, but am better now. I have not even\r\n    heard of the arrival of my novel; but I suppose for his own sake, Papa\r\n    will dispose of it to the best advantage. If you see it advertised,\r\n    pray tell me, also its publisher, etc.\r\n\r\n    We have heard from Hunt the day he was to sail, and anxiously and\r\n    daily now await his arrival. Shelley will go over to Leghorn to him,\r\n    and I also, if I can so manage it. We shall be at Pisa next winter, I\r\n    believe, fate so decrees. Of course you have heard that the lawsuit\r\n    went against my Father. This was the summit and crown of our spring\r\n    misfortunes, but he writes in so few words, and in such a manner, that\r\n    any information that I could get, through any one, would be a great\r\n    benefit to me. Adieu. Pray write now, and at length. Remember both\r\n    Shelley and me to Hogg. Did you get _Matilda_ from Papa?--Yours ever,\r\n\r\n      MARY W. SHELLEY.\r\n\r\n    Continue to direct to Pisa.\r\n\r\nClare returned to the Casa Magni on the 6th of July. The weather had now\r\nbecome intensely hot, and Mary was again prostrated by it. Alarming\r\nsymptoms appeared, and after a wretched week of ill health, these came to\r\na crisis in a dangerous miscarriage. She was destitute of medical aid or\r\nappliances, and, weakened as she already was, they feared for her life.\r\nShe had lain ill for several hours before some ice could be procured, and\r\nShelley then took upon himself the responsibility of its immediate use;\r\nthe event proved him right; and when at last a doctor came, he found her\r\ndoing well. Her strength, however, was reduced to the lowest ebb; her\r\nspirits also; and within a week of this misfortune her recovery was\r\nretarded by a dreadful nervous shock she received through Shelley's\r\nwalking in his sleep.[49]\r\n\r\nWhile Mary was enduring a time of physical and mental suffering beyond\r\nwhat can be told, and such as no man can wholly understand, Shelley, for\r\nhis part, was enjoying unwonted health and good spirits. And such\r\ncreatures are we all that unwonted health in ourself is even a stronger\r\npower for happiness than is the sickness of another for depression.\r\n\r\nHe was sorry for Mary's gloom, but he could not lighten it, and he was\r\npersistently content in spite of it. This has led to the supposition that\r\nthere was, at this time, a serious want of sympathy between Shelley and\r\nMary. His only want, he said in an often-quoted letter, was the presence\r\nof those who could feel, and understand him, and he added, \"Whether from\r\nproximity, and the continuity of domestic intercourse, Mary does not.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been almost miraculous had it been otherwise. Perhaps\r\nnothing in the world is harder than for a person suffering from exhausting\r\nillness, and from the extreme of nervous and mental depression, to enter\r\ninto the mood of temporary elation of another person whose spirits, as a\r\nrule, are uneven, and in need of constant support from others. But the\r\ncontext of this very letter of Shelley's shows clearly enough that he\r\nmeant nothing desperate, no shipwreck of the heart; for, as the people who\r\ncould \"feel, and understand him,\" he instances his correspondents, Mr. and\r\nMrs. Gisborne, saying that his satisfaction would be complete if only\r\n_they_ were of the party; although, were his wishes not limited by his\r\nhopes, Hogg would also be included. He would have liked a little\r\nintellectual stimulus and comradeship. As it was, he was well satisfied\r\nwith an intercourse of which \"words were not the instruments.\"\r\n\r\n    I like Jane more and more, and I find Williams the most amiable of\r\n    companions.\r\n\r\nJane's guitar and her sweet singing were a new and perpetual delight to\r\nhim, and she herself supplied him with just as much suggestion of an\r\nunrealised ideal as was necessary to keep his imagination alive. She, on\r\nher side, understood him and knew how to manage him perfectly; as a great\r\nman may be understood by a clever woman who is so far from having an\r\nintellectual comprehension of him that she is not distressed by the\r\nconsciousness of its imperfection or its absence, but succeeds by dint of\r\ndelicate social intuition, guided by just so much sense of humour as saves\r\nher from exaggeration, or from blunders; and who understands her great man\r\non his human side so much better than the poor creature understands\r\nhimself, as to wind him at will, easily, gracefully, and insensibly, round\r\nher little finger. And so, without sacrificing a moment's peace of mind,\r\nJane Williams won over Shelley an ascendency which was pleasing to both\r\nand convenient to every one. No better instance could be given of her\r\nmethod than the well-known episode of his sudden proposal to her to\r\noverturn the boat, and, together, to \"solve the great mystery\"; inimitably\r\ntold by Trelawny. And so the month of June sped away.\r\n\r\n    \"I have a boat here,\" wrote Shelley to John Gisborne, ... \"it cost me\r\n    L80, and reduced me to some difficulty in point of money. However, it\r\n    is swift and beautiful, and appears quite a vessel. Williams is\r\n    captain, and we glide along this delightful bay, in the evening wind,\r\n    under the summer moon, until earth appears another world. Jane brings\r\n    her guitar, and if the past and the future could be obliterated, the\r\n    present would content me so well that I could say with Faust to the\r\n    present moment, 'Remain; thou art so beautiful.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, like Faust, having said this, like Faust's, his hour had come.\r\n\r\nHe heard from Genoa of the Leigh Hunts' arrival, so far, on their journey,\r\nand wrote at once to Hunt a letter of warmest welcome to Italy, promising\r\nto start for Leghorn the instant he should hear of the Hunts' vessel\r\nhaving sailed for that port.\r\n\r\n    Poor Mary, who sends you a thousand loves, has been seriously ill,\r\n    having suffered a most debilitating miscarriage. She is still too\r\n    unwell to rise from the sofa, and must take great care of herself for\r\n    some time, or she would come with us to Leghorn. Lord Byron is in\r\n    _villegiatura_ near Leghorn, and you will meet besides with a Mr.\r\n    Trelawny, a wild, but kind-hearted seaman.\r\n\r\nThe Hunts sailed; and, on the 1st of July, Shelley and Williams, with\r\nCharles Vivian, the sailor-lad who looked after their boat, started in the\r\n_Ariel_ for Leghorn, where they arrived safely. Thence Shelley, with Leigh\r\nHunt, proceeded to Pisa. It had not been their intention to stay long, but\r\nShelley found much to detain him. Matters with respect to Byron and the\r\nprojected magazine wore a most unsatisfactory appearance; Byron's\r\neagerness had cooled, and his reception of the Hunts was chilling in the\r\nextreme. Poor Mrs. Hunt was very seriously ill, and the letter which Mary\r\nreceived from her husband was mainly to explain his prolonged absence. She\r\nhad let him go from her side with the greatest unwillingness; she was\r\nhaunted by the gloomiest forebodings and a sense of unexplained misery\r\nwhich they all ascribed to her illness, and her letters were written in a\r\ntone of depression which made Shelley anxious on her account, and Edward\r\nWilliams on that of his wife, who, he feared, might be unhappy during his\r\nabsence from her.\r\n\r\nBut Jane wrote brightly, and gave an improved account of Mary.\r\n\r\n    SHELLEY TO MARY.\r\n\r\n    PISA, _4th July 1822_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST MARY--I have received both your letters, and shall attend\r\n    to the instructions they convey. I did not think of buying the\r\n    _Bolivar_; Lord Byron wishes to sell her, but I imagine would prefer\r\n    ready money. I have as yet made no inquiries about houses near\r\n    Pugnano--I have had no moment of time to spare from Hunt's affairs. I\r\n    am detained unwillingly here, and you will probably see Williams in\r\n    the boat before me, but that will be decided to-morrow.\r\n\r\n    Things are in the worst possible situation with respect to poor Hunt.\r\n    I find Marianne in a desperate state of health, and on our arrival at\r\n    Pisa sent for Vacca. He decides that her case is hopeless, and,\r\n    although it will be lingering, must end fatally. This decision he\r\n    thought proper to communicate to Hunt, indicating at the same time\r\n    with great judgment and precision the treatment necessary to be\r\n    observed for availing himself of the chance of his being deceived.\r\n    This intelligence has extinguished the last spark of poor Hunt's\r\n    spirits, low enough before. The children are well and much improved.\r\n    Lord Byron is at this moment on the point of leaving Tuscany. The\r\n    Gambas have been exiled, and he declares his intention of following\r\n    their fortunes. His first idea was to sail to America, which was\r\n    changed to Switzerland, then to Genoa, and last to Lucca. Everybody is\r\n    in despair, and everything in confusion. Trelawny was on the point of\r\n    sailing to Genoa for the purpose of transporting the _Bolivar_\r\n    overland to the Lake of Geneva, and had already whispered in my ear\r\n    his desire that I should not influence Lord Byron against this\r\n    terrestrial navigation. He next received _orders_ to weigh anchor and\r\n    set sail for Lerici. He is now without instructions, moody and\r\n    disappointed. But it is the worse for poor Hunt, unless the present\r\n    storm should blow over. He places his whole dependence upon the\r\n    scheme of the journal, for which every arrangement has been made. Lord\r\n    Byron must, of course, furnish the requisite funds at present, as I\r\n    cannot; but he seems inclined to depart without the necessary\r\n    explanations and arrangements due to such a situation as Hunt's.\r\n    These, in spite of delicacy, I must procure; he offers him the\r\n    copyright of the _Vision of Judgment_ for the first number. This\r\n    offer, if sincere, is _more_ than enough to set up the journal, and,\r\n    if sincere, will set everything right.\r\n\r\n    How are you, my best Mary? Write especially how is your health, and\r\n    how your spirits are, and whether you are not more reconciled to\r\n    staying at Lerici, at least during the summer. You have no idea how I\r\n    am hurried and occupied; I have not a moment's leisure, but will write\r\n    by next post. Ever, dearest Mary, yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n      S.\r\n\r\n    I have found the translation of the _Symposium_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SHELLEY TO JANE WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\n    PISA, _4th July 1822_.\r\n\r\n    You will probably see Williams before I can disentangle myself from\r\n    the affairs with which I am now surrounded. I return to Leghorn\r\n    to-night, and shall urge him to sail with the first fair wind without\r\n    expecting me. I have thus the pleasure of contributing to your\r\n    happiness when deprived of every other, and of leaving you no other\r\n    subject of regret but the absence of one scarcely worth regretting. I\r\n    fear you are solitary and melancholy at the Villa Magni, and, in the\r\n    intervals of the greater and more serious distress in which I am\r\n    compelled to sympathise here, I figure to myself the countenance which\r\n    has been the source of such consolation to me, shadowed by a veil of\r\n    sorrow.\r\n\r\n    How soon those hours passed, and how slowly they return, to pass so\r\n    soon again, and perhaps for ever, in which we have lived together so\r\n    intimately, so happily! Adieu, my dearest friend. I only write these\r\n    lines for the pleasure of tracing what will meet your eyes. Mary will\r\n    tell you all the news.\r\n\r\n      S.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FROM JANE WILLIAMS TO SHELLEY.\r\n\r\n    _6th July._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST FRIEND--Your few melancholy lines have indeed cast your own\r\n    visionary veil over a countenance that was animated with the hope of\r\n    seeing you return with far different tidings. We heard yesterday that\r\n    you had left Leghorn in company with the _Bolivar_, and would\r\n    assuredly be here in the morning at 5 o'clock; therefore I got up, and\r\n    from the terrace saw (or I dreamt it) the _Bolivar_ opposite in the\r\n    offing. She hoisted more sail, and went through the Straits. What can\r\n    this mean? Hope and uncertainty have made such a chaos in my mind that\r\n    I know not what to think. My own Neddino does not deign to lighten my\r\n    darkness by a single word. Surely I shall see him to-night. Perhaps,\r\n    too, you are with him. Well, _pazienza_!\r\n\r\n    Mary, I am happy to tell you, goes on well; she talks of going to\r\n    Pisa, and indeed your poor friends seem to require all her assistance.\r\n    For me, alas! I can only offer sympathy, and my fervent wishes that a\r\n    brighter cloud may soon dispel the present gloom. I hope much from the\r\n    air of Pisa for Mrs. Hunt.\r\n\r\n    Lord B.'s departure gives me pleasure, for whatever may be the present\r\n    difficulties and disappointments, they are small to what you would\r\n    have suffered had he remained with you. This I say in the spirit of\r\n    prophecy, so gather consolation from it.\r\n\r\n    I have only time left to scrawl you a hasty adieu, and am\r\n    affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n      J. W.\r\n\r\n    Why do you talk of never enjoying moments like the past? Are you going\r\n    to join your friend Plato, or do you expect I shall do so soon? _Buona\r\n    notte._\r\n\r\nMary was slowly getting better, and hoping to feel brighter by the time\r\nShelley came back. On the 7th of July she wrote a few lines in her\r\njournal, summing up the month during which she had left it untouched.\r\n\r\n    _Sunday, July 7._--I am ill most of this time. Ill, and then\r\n    convalescent. Roberts and Trelawny arrive with the _Bolivar_. On\r\n    Monday, 16th June, Trelawny goes on to Leghorn with her. Roberts\r\n    remains here until 1st July, when the Hunts being arrived, Shelley\r\n    goes in the boat with him and Edward to Leghorn. They are still there.\r\n    Read _Jacopo Ortis_, second volume of _Geographica Fisica_, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nNext day, Monday the 8th, when the voyagers were expected to return, it\r\nwas so stormy all day at Lerici that their having sailed was considered\r\nout of the question, and their non-arrival excited no surprise in Mary or\r\nJane. So many possibilities and probabilities might detain them at Leghorn\r\nor Pisa, that their wives did not get anxious for three or four days; and\r\neven then what the two women dreaded was not calamity at sea, but illness\r\nor disagreeable business on shore. On Thursday, however, getting no\r\nletters, they did become uneasy, and, but for the rough weather, Jane\r\nWilliams would have started in a row-boat for Leghorn. On Friday they\r\nwatched with feverish anxiety for the post; there was but one letter, and\r\nit turned them to stone. It was to Shelley, from Leigh Hunt, begging him\r\nto write and say how he had got home in the bad weather of the previous\r\nMonday. And then it dawned upon them--a dawn of darkness. There was no\r\nnews; there would be no news any more.\r\n\r\nOne minute had untied the knot, and solved the great mystery. The _Ariel_\r\nhad gone down in the storm, with all hands on board.\r\n\r\nAnd for four days past, though they had not known it, Mary Shelley and\r\nJane Williams had been widows.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.
