REGIUS PROFESSOR OF MODERN HISTORY IN THE\r\nUNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, IN ADMIRATION OF HIS PROFOUND HISTORICAL\r\nLEARNING, AND IN GRATITUDE FOR ADVICE AND HELP GENEROUSLY GIVEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nAn apology seems to be called for from anyone who gives to the world a\r\nnew Life of Napoleon I. My excuse must be that for many years I have\r\nsought to revise the traditional story of his career in the light of\r\nfacts gleaned from the British Archives and of the many valuable\r\nmaterials that have recently been published by continental historians.\r\nTo explain my manner of dealing with these sources would require an\r\nelaborate critical Introduction; but, as the limits of my space\r\nabsolutely preclude any such attempt, I can only briefly refer to the\r\nmost important topics.\r\n\r\nTo deal with the published sources first, I would name as of chief\r\nimportance the works of MM. Aulard, Chuquet, Houssaye, Sorel, and\r\nVandal in France; of Herren Beer, Delbrück, Fournier, Lehmann, Oncken,\r\nand Wertheimer in Germany and Austria; and of Baron Lumbroso in Italy.\r\nI have also profited largely by the scholarly monographs or\r\ncollections of documents due to the labours of the \"Société d'Histoire\r\nContemporaine,\" the General Staff of the French Army, of MM. Bouvier,\r\nCaudrillier, Capitaine \"J.G.,\" Lévy, Madelin, Sagnac, Sciout, Zivy,\r\nand others in France; and of Herren Bailleu, Demelitsch, Hansing,\r\nKlinkowstrom, Luckwaldt, Ulmann, and others in Germany. Some of the\r\nrecently published French Memoirs dealing with those times are not\r\ndevoid of value, though this class of literature is to be used with\r\ncaution. The new letters of Napoleon published by M. Léon Lecestre and\r\nM. Léonce de Brotonne have also opened up fresh vistas into the life\r\nof the great man; and the time seems to have come when we may safely\r\nrevise our judgments on many of its episodes.\r\n\r\nBut I should not have ventured on this great undertaking, had I not\r\nbeen able to contribute something new to Napoleonic literature. During\r\na study of this period for an earlier work published in the \"Cambridge\r\nHistorical Series,\" I ascertained the great value of the British\r\nrecords for the years 1795-1815. It is surely discreditable to our\r\nhistorical research that, apart from the fruitful labours of the Navy\r\nRecords Society, of Messrs. Oscar Browning and Hereford George, and of\r\nMr. Bowman of Toronto, scarcely any English work has appeared that is\r\nbased on the official records of this period. Yet they are of great\r\ninterest and value. Our diplomatic agents then had the knack of\r\ngetting at State secrets in most foreign capitals, even when we were\r\nat war with their Governments; and our War Office and Admiralty\r\nRecords have also yielded me some interesting \"finds.\" M. Lévy, in the\r\npreface to his \"Napoléon intime\" (1893), has well remarked that \"the\r\ndocumentary history of the wars of the Empire has not yet been\r\nwritten. To write it accurately, it will be more important thoroughly\r\nto know foreign archives than those of France.\" Those of Russia,\r\nAustria, and Prussia have now for the most part been examined; and I\r\nthink that I may claim to have searched all the important parts of our\r\nForeign Office Archives for the years in question, as well as for part\r\nof the St. Helena period. I have striven to embody the results of this\r\nsearch in the present volumes as far as was compatible with limits of\r\nspace and with the narrative form at which, in my judgment, history\r\nought always to aim.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, British policy comes out the better the more fully it is\r\nknown. Though often feeble and vacillating, it finally attained to\r\nfirmness and dignity; and Ministers closed the cycle of war with acts\r\nof magnanimity towards the French people which are studiously ignored\r\nby those who bid us shed tears over the martyrdom of St. Helena.\r\nNevertheless, the splendour of the finale must not blind us to the\r\nflaccid eccentricities that made British statesmanship the laughing\r\nstock of Europe in 1801-3, 1806-7, and 1809. Indeed, it is\r\nquestionable whether the renewal of war between England and Napoleon\r\nin 1803 was due more to his innate forcefulness or to the contempt\r\nwhich he felt for the Addington Cabinet. When one also remembers our\r\nextraordinary blunders in the war of the Third Coalition, it seems a\r\nmiracle that the British Empire survived that life and death struggle\r\nagainst a man of superhuman genius who was determined to effect its\r\noverthrow. I have called special attention to the extent and\r\npertinacity of Napoleon's schemes for the foundation of a French\r\nColonial Empire in India, Egypt, South Africa, and Australia; and\r\nthere can be no doubt that the events of the years 1803-13 determined,\r\nnot only the destinies of Europe and Napoleon, but the general trend\r\nof the world's colonization.\r\n\r\nAs it has been necessary to condense the story of Napoleon's life in\r\nsome parts, I have chosen to treat with special brevity the years\r\n1809-11, which may be called the _constans aetas_ of his career, in\r\norder to have more space for the decisive events that followed; but\r\neven in these less eventful years I have striven to show how his\r\nContinental System was setting at work mighty economic forces that\r\nmade for his overthrow, so that after the _débâcle_ of 1812 it came to\r\nbe a struggle of Napoleon and France _contra mundum_.\r\n\r\nWhile not neglecting the personal details of the great man's life, I\r\nhave dwelt mainly on his public career. Apart from his brilliant\r\nconversations, his private life has few features of abiding interest,\r\nperhaps because he early tired of the shallowness of Josephine and the\r\nCorsican angularity of his brothers and sisters. But the cause also\r\nlay in his own disposition. He once said to M. Gallois: \"Je n'aime pas\r\nbeaucoup les femmes, ni le jeu--enfin rien: _je suis tout à fait un\r\nêtre politique_.\" In dealing with him as a warrior and statesman, and\r\nin sparing my readers details as to his bolting his food, sleeping at\r\nconcerts, and indulging in amours where for him there was no glamour\r\nof romance, I am laying stress on what interested him most--in a word,\r\nI am taking him at his best.\r\n\r\nI could not have accomplished this task, even in the present\r\ninadequate way, but for the help generously accorded from many\r\nquarters. My heartfelt thanks are due to Lord Acton, Regius Professor\r\nof Modern History in the University of Cambridge, for advice of the\r\nhighest importance; to Mr. Hubert Hall of the Public Record Office,\r\nfor guidance in my researches there; to Baron Lumbroso of Rome,\r\neditor of the \"Bibliografia ragionata dell' Epoca Napoleonica,\" for\r\nhints on Italian and other affairs; to Dr. Luckwaldt, Privat Docent of\r\nthe University of Bonn, and author of \"Oesterreich und die Anfänge des\r\nBefreiungs-Krieges,\" for his very scholarly revision of the chapters\r\non German affairs; to Mr. F.H.E. Cunliffe, M.A., Fellow of All Souls'\r\nCollege, Oxford, for valuable advice on the campaigns of 1800, 1805,\r\nand 1806; to Professor Caudrillier of Grenoble, author of \"Pichegru,\"\r\nfor information respecting the royalist plot; and to Messrs. J.E.\r\nMorris, M.A., and E.L.S. Horsburgh, B.A., for detailed communications\r\nconcerning Waterloo, The nieces of the late Professor Westwood of\r\nOxford most kindly allowed the facsimile of the new Napoleon letter,\r\nprinted opposite p. 156 of vol. i., to be made from the original in\r\ntheir possession; and Miss Lowe courteously placed at my disposal the\r\npapers of her father relating to the years 1813-15, as well as to the\r\nSt. Helena period. I wish here to record my grateful obligations for\r\nall these friendly courtesies, which have given value to the book,\r\nbesides saving me from many of the pitfalls with which the subject\r\nabounds. That I have escaped them altogether is not to be imagined;\r\nbut I can honestly say, in the words of the late Bishop of London,\r\nthat \"I have tried to write true history.\"\r\n\r\nJ.H.R.\r\n\r\n[NOTE.--The references to Napoleon's \"Correspondence\" in the notes are\r\nto the official French edition, published under the auspices of\r\nNapoleon III. The \"New Letters of Napoleon\" are those edited by Léon\r\nLecestre, and translated into English by Lady Mary Loyd, except in a\r\nvery few cases where M. Léonce de Brotonne's still more recent edition\r\nis cited under his name. By \"F.O.,\" France, No.----, and \"F.O.,\"\r\nPrussia, No.----, are meant the volumes of _our_ Foreign Office\r\ndespatches relating to France and Prussia. For the sake of brevity I\r\nhave called Napoleon's Marshals and high officials by their names, not\r\nby their titles: but a list of these is given at the close of vol.\r\nii.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe demand for this work so far exceeded my expectations that I was\r\nunable to make any considerable changes in the second edition, issued\r\nin March, 1902; and circumstances again make it impossible for me to\r\ngive the work that thorough recension which I should desire. I have,\r\nhowever, carefully considered the suggestions offered by critics, and\r\nhave adopted them in some cases. Professor Fournier of Vienna has most\r\nkindly furnished me with details which seem to relegate to the domain\r\nof legend the famous ice catastrophe at Austerlitz; and I have added a\r\nnote to this effect on p. 50 of vol. ii. On the other hand, I may\r\njustly claim that the publication of Count Balmain's reports relating\r\nto St. Helena has served to corroborate, in all important details, my\r\naccount of Napoleon's captivity.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to add that I much regret the omission of Mr. Oman's\r\nname from II. 12-13 of page viii of the Preface, an omission rendered\r\nall the more conspicuous by the appearance of the first volume of his\r\n\"History of the Peninsular War\" in the spring of this year.\r\n\r\nJ.H.R.\r\n\r\n_October, 1902._\r\n\r\nNotes have been added at the end of ch. v., vol. i.; chs. xxii.,\r\nxxiii., xxviii., xxix., xxxv., vol. ii.; and an Appendix on the Battle\r\nof Waterloo has been added on p. 577, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER\r\n\r\n\r\nVOL.

Five\r\ndays (in leap years six) were added at the end of the year to bring it\r\ninto coincidence with the solar year.\r\n\r\n  An    I began Sept. 22, 1792.\r\n  \"    II  \"      \"       1793.\r\n  \"   III  \"      \"       1794.\r\n  \"    IV (leap year)     1795.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"  VIII began Sept. 22, 1799.\r\n  \"    IX   \"   Sept. 23, 1800.\r\n  \"     X   \"      \"      1801.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"   XIV   \"      \"      1805.\r\n\r\nThe new computation, though reckoned from Sept. 22, 1792, was not\r\nintroduced until Nov. 26, 1793 (An II). It ceased after Dec. 31, 1805.\r\n\r\nThe months are as follows:\r\n\r\n    Vendémiaire              Sept. 22 to Oct. 21.\r\n    Brumaire                 Oct. 22  \"  Nov. 20.\r\n    Frimaire                 Nov. 21  \"  Dec. 20.\r\n    Nivôse                   Dec. 21  \"  Jan. 19.\r\n    Pluviôse                 Jan. 20  \"  Feb. 18.\r\n    Ventôse                  Feb. 19  \"  Mar. 20.\r\n    Germinal                 Mar. 21  \"  April 19.\r\n    Floréal                  April 20 \"  May 19.\r\n    Prairial                 May 20   \"  June 18.\r\n    Messidor                 June 19  \"  July 18.\r\n    Thermidor                July 19  \"  Aug. 17.\r\n    Fructidor                Aug. 18  \"  Sept. 16.\r\n\r\nAdd five (in leap years six) \"Sansculottides\" or \"Jours\r\ncomplémentaires.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1796 (leap year) the numbers in the table of months, so far as\r\nconcerns all dates between Feb. 28 and Sept. 22, will have to be\r\n_reduced by one_, owing to the intercalation of Feb. 29, which is not\r\ncompensated for until the end of the republican year.\r\n\r\nThe matter is further complicated by the fact that the republicans\r\nreckoned An VIII as a leap year, though it is not one in the Gregorian\r\nCalendar. Hence that year ended on Sept. 22, and An IX and succeeding\r\nyears began on Sept. 23. Consequently in the above table of months the\r\nnumbers of all days from Vendémiaire 1, An IX (Sept. 23, 1800), to\r\nNivôse 10, An XIV (Dec. 31, 1805), inclusive, will have to be\r\n_increased by one_, except only in the next leap year between Ventôse\r\n9, An XII, and Vendémiaire 1, An XIII (Feb. 28-Sept, 23, 1804), when\r\nthe two Revolutionary aberrations happen to neutralize each other.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF NAPOLEON I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nPARENTAGE AND EARLY YEARS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was born when my country was perishing. Thirty thousand French\r\nvomited upon our coasts, drowning the throne of Liberty in waves of\r\nblood, such was the sight which struck my eyes.\" This passionate\r\nutterance, penned by Napoleon Buonaparte at the beginning of the\r\nFrench Revolution, describes the state of Corsica in his natal year.\r\nThe words are instinct with the vehemence of the youth and the\r\nextravagant sentiment of the age: they strike the keynote of his\r\ncareer. His life was one of strain and stress from his cradle to his\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nIn his temperament as in the circumstances of his time the young\r\nBuonaparte was destined for an extraordinary career. Into a tottering\r\ncivilization he burst with all the masterful force of an Alaric. But\r\nhe was an Alaric of the south, uniting the untamed strength of his\r\nisland kindred with the mental powers of his Italian ancestry. In his\r\npersonality there is a complex blending of force and grace, of animal\r\npassion and mental clearness, of northern common sense with the\r\npromptings of an oriental imagination; and this union in his nature of\r\nseeming opposites explains many of the mysteries of his life.\r\nFortunately for lovers of romance, genius cannot be wholly analyzed,\r\neven by the most adroit historical philosophizer or the most exacting\r\nchampion of heredity. But in so far as the sources of Napoleon's power\r\ncan be measured, they may be traced to the unexampled needs of mankind\r\nin the revolutionary epoch and to his own exceptional endowments.\r\nEvidently, then, the characteristics of his family claim some\r\nattention from all who would understand the man and the influence\r\nwhich he was to wield over modern Europe.\r\n\r\nIt has been the fortune of his House to be the subject of dispute from\r\nfirst to last. Some writers have endeavoured to trace its descent back\r\nto the Cæsars of Rome, others to the Byzantine Emperors; one\r\ngenealogical explorer has tracked the family to Majorca, and, altering\r\nits name to Bonpart, has discovered its progenitor in the Man of the\r\nIron Mask; while the Duchesse d'Abrantès, voyaging eastwards in quest\r\nof its ancestors, has confidently claimed for the family a Greek\r\norigin. Painstaking research has dispelled these romancings of\r\nhistorical _trouveurs_, and has connected this enigmatic stock with a\r\nFlorentine named \"William, who in the year 1261 took the surname of\r\n_Bonaparte_ or _Buonaparte_. The name seems to have been assumed when,\r\namidst the unceasing strifes between Guelfs and Ghibellines that rent\r\nthe civic life of Florence, William's party, the Ghibellines, for a\r\nbrief space gained the ascendancy. But perpetuity was not to be found\r\nin Florentine politics; and in a short time he was a fugitive at a\r\nTuscan village, Sarzana, beyond the reach of the victorious Guelfs.\r\nHere the family seems to have lived for well nigh three centuries,\r\nmaintaining its Ghibelline and aristocratic principles with surprising\r\ntenacity. The age was not remarkable for the virtue of constancy, or\r\nany other virtue. Politics and private life were alike demoralized by\r\nunceasing intrigues; and amidst strifes of Pope and Emperor, duchies\r\nand republics, cities and autocrats, there was formed that type of\r\nItalian character which is delineated in the pages of Macchiavelli.\r\nFrom the depths of debasement of that cynical age the Buonapartes\r\nwere saved by their poverty, and by the isolation of their life at\r\nSarzana. Yet the embassies discharged at intervals by the more\r\ntalented members of the family showed that the gifts for intrigue were\r\nonly dormant; and they were certainly transmitted in their intensity\r\nto the greatest scion of the race.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1529 Francis Buonaparte, whether pressed by poverty or\r\ndistracted by despair at the misfortunes which then overwhelmed Italy,\r\nmigrated to Corsica. There the family was grafted upon a tougher\r\nbranch of the Italian race. To the vulpine characteristics developed\r\nunder the shadow of the Medici there were now added qualities of a\r\nmore virile stamp. Though dominated in turn by the masters of the\r\nMediterranean, by Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, by the men of Pisa,\r\nand finally by the Genoese Republic, the islanders retained a striking\r\nindividuality. The rock-bound coast and mountainous interior helped to\r\npreserve the essential features of primitive life. Foreign Powers\r\nmight affect the towns on the sea-board, but they left the clans of\r\nthe interior comparatively untouched. Their life centred around the\r\nfamily. The Government counted for little or nothing; for was it not\r\nthe symbol of the detested foreign rule? Its laws were therefore as\r\nnaught when they conflicted with the unwritten but omnipotent code of\r\nfamily honour. A slight inflicted on a neighbour would call forth the\r\nwarning words--\"Guard thyself: I am on my guard.\" Forthwith there\r\nbegan a blood feud, a vendetta, which frequently dragged on its dreary\r\ncourse through generations of conspiracy and murder, until, the\r\nprincipals having vanished, the collateral branches of the families\r\nwere involved. No Corsican was so loathed as the laggard who shrank\r\nfrom avenging the family honour, even on a distant relative of the\r\nfirst offender. The murder of the Duc d'Enghien by Napoleon in 1804\r\nsent a thrill of horror through the Continent. To the Corsicans it\r\nseemed little more than an autocratic version of the _vendetta\r\ntraversale_.[1]\r\n\r\nThe vendetta was the chief law of Corsican society up to comparatively\r\nrecent times; and its effects are still visible in the life of the\r\nstern islanders. In his charming romance, \"Colomba,\" M. Prosper\r\nMérimée has depicted the typical Corsican, even of the towns, as\r\npreoccupied, gloomy, suspicious, ever on the alert, hovering about his\r\ndwelling, like a falcon over his nest, seemingly in preparation for\r\nattack or defence. Laughter, the song, the dance, were rarely heard in\r\nthe streets; for the women, after acting as the drudges of the\r\nhousehold, were kept jealously at home, while their lords smoked and\r\nwatched. If a game at hazard were ventured upon, it ran its course in\r\nsilence, which not seldom was broken by the shot or the stab--first\r\nwarning that there had been underhand play. The deed always preceded\r\nthe word.\r\n\r\nIn such a life, where commerce and agriculture were despised, where\r\nwoman was mainly a drudge and man a conspirator, there grew up the\r\ntypical Corsican temperament, moody and exacting, but withal keen,\r\nbrave, and constant, which looked on the world as a fencing-school for\r\nthe glorification of the family and the clan[2]. Of this type Napoleon\r\nwas to be the supreme exemplar; and the fates granted him as an arena\r\na chaotic France and a distracted Europe.\r\n\r\nAmidst that grim Corsican existence the Buonapartes passed their lives\r\nduring the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Occupied as advocates\r\nand lawyers with such details of the law as were of any practical\r\nimportance, they must have been involved in family feuds and the\r\noft-recurring disputes between Corsica and the suzerain Power, Genoa.\r\nAs became dignitaries in the municipality of Ajaccio, several of the\r\nBuonapartes espoused the Genoese side; and the Genoese Senate in a\r\ndocument of the year 1652 styled one of them, Jérome, \"Egregius\r\nHieronimus di Buonaparte, procurator Nobilium.\" These distinctions\r\nthey seem to have little coveted. Very few families belonged to the\r\nCorsican _noblesse_, and their fiefs were unimportant. In Corsica, as\r\nin the Forest Cantons of Switzerland and the Highlands of Scotland,\r\nclass distinctions were by no means so coveted as in lands that had\r\nbeen thoroughly feudalized; and the Buonapartes, content with their\r\ncivic dignities at Ajaccio and the attachment of their partisans on\r\ntheir country estates, seem rarely to have used the prefix which\r\nimplied nobility. Their life was not unlike that of many an old\r\nScottish laird, who, though possibly _bourgeois_ in origin, yet by\r\ncourtesy ranked as chieftain among his tenants, and was ennobled by\r\nthe parlance of the countryside, perhaps all the more readily because\r\nhe refused to wear the honours that came from over the Border.\r\n\r\nBut a new influence was now to call forth all the powers of this tough\r\nstock. In the middle of the eighteenth century we find the head of the\r\nfamily, Charles Marie Buonaparte, aglow with the flame of Corsican\r\npatriotism then being kindled by the noble career of Paoli. This\r\ngifted patriot, the champion of the islanders, first against the\r\nGenoese and later against the French, desired to cement by education\r\nthe framework of the Corsican Commonwealth and founded a university.\r\nIt was here that the father of the future French Emperor received a\r\ntraining in law, and a mental stimulus which was to lift his family\r\nabove the level of the _caporali_ and attorneys with whom its lot had\r\nfor centuries been cast. His ambition is seen in the endeavour,\r\nsuccessfully carried out by his uncle, Lucien, Archdeacon of Ajaccio,\r\nto obtain recognition of kinship with the Buonapartes of Tuscany who\r\nhad been ennobled by the Grand Duke. His patriotism is evinced in his\r\nardent support of Paoli, by whose valour and energy the Genoese were\r\nfinally driven from the island. Amidst these patriotic triumphs\r\nCharles confronted his destiny in the person of Letizia Ramolino, a\r\nbeautiful girl, descended from an honourable Florentine family which\r\nhad for centuries been settled in Corsica. The wedding took place in\r\n1764, the bridegroom being then eighteen, and the bride fifteen years\r\nof age. The union, if rashly undertaken in the midst of civil strifes,\r\nwas yet well assorted. Both parties to it were of patrician, if not\r\ndefinitely noble descent, and came of families which combined the\r\nintellectual gifts of Tuscany with the vigour of their later island\r\nhome[3]. From her mother's race, the Pietra Santa family, Letizia\r\nimbibed the habits of the most backward and savage part of Corsica,\r\nwhere vendettas were rife and education was almost unknown. Left in\r\nignorance in her early days, she yet was accustomed to hardships, and\r\noften showed the fertility of resource which such a life always\r\ndevelops. Hence, at the time of her marriage, she possessed a firmness\r\nof will far beyond her years; and her strength and fortitude enabled\r\nher to survive the terrible adversities of her early days, as also to\r\nmeet with quiet matronly dignity the extraordinary honours showered on\r\nher as the mother of the French Emperor. She was inured to habits of\r\nfrugality, which reappeared in the personal tastes of her son. In\r\nfact, she so far retained her old parsimonious habits, even amidst the\r\nsplendours of the French Imperial Court, as to expose herself to the\r\ncharge of avarice. But there is a touching side to all this. She seems\r\never to have felt that after the splendour there would come again the\r\nold days of adversity, and her instincts were in one sense correct.\r\nShe lived on to the advanced age of eighty-six, and died twenty-one\r\nyears after the break-up of her son's empire--a striking proof of the\r\nvitality and tenacity of her powers.\r\n\r\nA kindly Providence veiled the future from the young couple. Troubles\r\nfell swiftly upon them both in private and in public life. Their first\r\ntwo children died in infancy. The third, Joseph, was born in 1768,\r\nwhen the Corsican patriots were making their last successful efforts\r\nagainst their new French oppressors: the fourth, the famous Napoleon,\r\nsaw the light on August 15th, 1769, when the liberties of Corsica were\r\nbeing finally extinguished. Nine other children were born before the\r\noutbreak of the French Revolution reawakened civil strifes, amidst\r\nwhich the then fatherless family was tossed to and fro and finally\r\nwhirled away to France.\r\n\r\nDestiny had already linked the fortunes of the young Napoleon\r\nBuonaparte with those of France. After the downfall of Genoese rule in\r\nCorsica, France had taken over, for empty promises, the claims of the\r\nhard-pressed Italian republic to its troublesome island possession. It\r\nwas a cheap and practical way of restoring, at least in the\r\nMediterranean the shattered prestige of the French Bourbons. They had\r\npreviously intervened in Corsican affairs on the side of the Genoese.\r\nYet in 1764 Paoli appealed to Louis XV. for protection. It was\r\ngranted, in the form of troops that proceeded quietly to occupy the\r\ncoast towns of the island under cover of friendly assurances. In 1768,\r\nbefore the expiration of an informal truce, Marbeuf, the French\r\ncommander, commenced hostilities against the patriots[4]. In vain did\r\nRousseau and many other champions of popular liberty protest against\r\nthis bartering away of insular freedom: in vain did Paoli rouse his\r\ncompatriots to another and more unequal struggle, and seek to hold the\r\nmountainous interior. Poor, badly equipped, rent by family feuds and\r\nclan schisms, his followers were no match for the French troops; and\r\nafter the utter break-up of his forces Paoli fled to England, taking\r\nwith him three hundred and forty of the most determined patriots. With\r\nthese irreconcilables Charles Buonaparte did not cast in his lot, but\r\naccepted the pardon offered to those who should recognize the French\r\nsway. With his wife and their little child Joseph he returned to\r\nAjaccio; and there, shortly afterwards, Napoleon was born. As the\r\npatriotic historian, Jacobi, has finely said, \"The Corsican people,\r\nwhen exhausted by producing martyrs to the cause of liberty, produced\r\nNapoleon Buonaparte[5].\"\r\n\r\nSeeing that Charles Buonaparte had been an ardent adherent of Paoli,\r\nhis sudden change of front has exposed him to keen censure. He\r\ncertainly had not the grit of which heroes are made. His seems to have\r\nbeen an ill-balanced nature, soon buoyed up by enthusiasms, and as\r\nspeedily depressed by their evaporation; endowed with enough of\r\nlearning and culture to be a Voltairean and write second-rate\r\nverses; and with a talent for intrigue which sufficed to embarrass\r\nhis never very affluent fortunes. Napoleon certainly derived no\r\nworld-compelling qualities from his father: for these he was indebted\r\nto the wilder strain which ran in his mother's blood. The father\r\ndoubtless saw in the French connection a chance of worldly advancement\r\nand of liberation from pecuniary difficulties; for the new rulers now\r\nsought to gain over the patrician families of the island. Many of them\r\nhad resented the dictatorship of Paoli; and they now gladly accepted\r\nthe connection with France, which promised to enrich their country and\r\nto open up a brilliant career in the French army, where commissions\r\nwere limited to the scions of nobility.\r\n\r\nMuch may be said in excuse of Charles Buonaparte's decision, and no\r\none can deny that Corsica has ultimately gained much by her connection\r\nwith France. But his change of front was open to the charge that it\r\nwas prompted by self-interest rather than by philosophic foresight. At\r\nany rate, his second son throughout his boyhood nursed a deep\r\nresentment against his father for his desertion of the patriots'\r\ncause. The youth's sympathies were with the peasants, whose allegiance\r\nwas not to be bought by baubles, whose constancy and bravery long held\r\nout against the French in a hopeless guerilla warfare. His hot\r\nCorsican blood boiled at the stories of oppression and insult which he\r\nheard from his humbler compatriots. When, at eleven years of age, he\r\nsaw in the military college at Brienne the portrait of Choiseul, the\r\nFrench Minister who had urged on the conquest of Corsica, his passion\r\nburst forth in a torrent of imprecations against the traitor; and,\r\neven after the death of his father in 1785, he exclaimed that he could\r\nnever forgive him for not following Paoli into exile.\r\n\r\nWhat trifles seem, at times, to alter the current of human affairs!\r\nHad his father acted thus, the young Napoleon would in all probability\r\nhave entered the military or naval service of Great Britain; he might\r\nhave shared Paoli's enthusiasm for the land of his adoption, and have\r\nfollowed the Corsican hero in his enterprises against the French\r\nRevolution, thenceforth figuring in history merely as a greater\r\nMarlborough, crushing the military efforts of democratic France, and\r\nluring England into a career of Continental conquest. Monarchy and\r\naristocracy would have gone unchallenged, except within the \"natural\r\nlimits\" of France; and the other nations, never shaken to their\r\ninmost depths, would have dragged on their old inert fragmentary\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe decision of Charles Buonaparte altered the destiny of Europe. He\r\ndetermined that his eldest boy, Joseph, should enter the Church, and\r\nthat Napoleon should be a soldier. His perception of the characters of\r\nhis boys was correct. An anecdote, for which the elder brother is\r\nresponsible, throws a flood of light on their temperaments. The master\r\nof their school arranged a mimic combat for his pupils--Romans against\r\nCarthaginians. Joseph, as the elder was ranged under the banner of\r\nRome, while Napoleon was told off among the Carthaginians; but, piqued\r\nat being chosen for the losing side, the child fretted, begged, and\r\nstormed until the less bellicose Joseph agreed to change places with\r\nhis exacting junior. The incident is prophetic of much in the later\r\nhistory of the family.\r\n\r\nIts imperial future was opened up by the deft complaisance now shown\r\nby Charles Buonaparte. The reward for his speedy submission to France\r\nwas soon forthcoming. The French commander in Corsica used his\r\ninfluence to secure the admission of the young Napoleon to the\r\nmilitary school of Brienne in Champagne; and as the father was able to\r\nsatisfy the authorities not only that he was without fortune, but also\r\nthat his family had been noble for four generations, Napoleon was\r\nadmitted to this school to be educated at the charges of the King of\r\nFrance (April, 1779). He was now, at the tender age of nine, a\r\nstranger in a strange land, among a people whom he detested as the\r\noppressors of his countrymen. Worst of all, he had to endure the taunt\r\nof belonging to a subject race. What a position for a proud and\r\nexacting child! Little wonder that the official report represented him\r\nas silent and obstinate; but, strange to say, it added the word\r\n\"imperious.\" It was a tough character which could defy repression\r\namidst such surroundings. As to his studies, little need be said. In\r\nhis French history he read of the glories of the distant past (when\r\n\"Germany was part of the French Empire\"), the splendours of the reign\r\nof Louis XIV., the disasters of France in the Seven Years' War, and\r\nthe \"prodigious conquests of the English in India.\" But his\r\nimagination was kindled from other sources. Boys of pronounced\r\ncharacter have always owed far more to their private reading than to\r\ntheir set studies; and the young Buonaparte, while grudgingly learning\r\nLatin and French grammar, was feeding his mind on Plutarch's\r\n\"Lives\"--in a French translation. The artful intermingling of the\r\nactual and the romantic, the historic and the personal, in those vivid\r\nsketches of ancient worthies and heroes, has endeared them to many\r\nminds. Rousseau derived unceasing profit from their perusal; and\r\nMadame Roland found in them \"the pasture of great souls.\" It was so\r\nwith the lonely Corsican youth. Holding aloof from his comrades in\r\ngloomy isolation, he caught in the exploits of Greeks and Romans a\r\ndistant echo of the tragic romance of his beloved island home. The\r\nlibrarian of the school asserted that even then the young soldier had\r\nmodelled his future career on that of the heroes of antiquity; and we\r\nmay well believe that, in reading of the exploits of Leonidas,\r\nCurtius, and Cincinnatus, he saw the figure of his own antique\r\nrepublican hero, Paoli. To fight side by side with Paoli against the\r\nFrench was his constant dream. \"Paoli will return,\" he once exclaimed,\r\n\"and as soon as I have strength, I will go to help him: and perhaps\r\ntogether we shall be able to shake the odious yoke from off the neck\r\nof Corsica.\"\r\n\r\nBut there was another work which exercised a great influence on his\r\nyoung mind--the \"Gallic War\" of Cæsar. To the young Italian the\r\nconquest of Gaul by a man of his own race must have been a congenial\r\ntopic, and in Cæsar himself the future conqueror may dimly have\r\nrecognized a kindred spirit. The masterful energy and all-conquering\r\nwill of the old Roman, his keen insight into the heart of a problem,\r\nthe wide sweep of his mental vision, ranging over the intrigues of the\r\nRoman Senate, the shifting politics of a score of tribes, and the\r\nmyriad administrative details of a great army and a mighty\r\nprovince--these were the qualities that furnished the chief mental\r\ntraining to the young cadet. Indeed, the career of Cæsar was destined\r\nto exert a singular fascination over the Napoleonic dynasty, not only\r\non its founder, but also on Napoleon III.; and the change in the\r\ncharacter and career of Napoleon the Great may be registered mentally\r\nin the effacement of the portraits of Leonidas and Paoli by those of\r\nCæsar and Alexander. Later on, during his sojourn at Ajaccio in 1790,\r\nwhen the first shadows were flitting across his hitherto unclouded\r\nlove for Paoli, we hear that he spent whole nights poring over Cæsar's\r\nhistory, committing many passages to memory in his passionate\r\nadmiration of those wondrous exploits. Eagerly he took Cæsar's side as\r\nagainst Pompey, and no less warmly defended him from the charge of\r\nplotting against the liberties of the commonwealth[6]. It was a\r\nperilous study for a republican youth in whom the military instincts\r\nwere as ingrained as the genius for rule.\r\n\r\nConcerning the young Buonaparte's life at Brienne there exist few\r\nauthentic records and many questionable anecdotes. Of these last, that\r\nwhich is the most credible and suggestive relates his proposal to his\r\nschoolfellows to construct ramparts of snow during the sharp winter of\r\n1783-4. According to his schoolfellow, Bourrienne, these mimic\r\nfortifications were planned by Buonaparte, who also directed the\r\nmethods of attack and defence: or, as others say, he reconstructed\r\nthe walls according to the needs of modern war. In either case, the\r\nincident bespeaks for him great power of organization and control. But\r\nthere were in general few outlets for his originality and vigour. He\r\nseems to have disliked all his comrades, except Bourrienne, as much as\r\nthey detested him for his moody humours and fierce outbreaks of\r\ntemper. He is even reported to have vowed that he would do as much\r\nharm as possible to the French people; but the remark smacks of the\r\nstory-book. Equally doubtful are the two letters in which he prays to\r\nbe removed from the indignities to which he was subjected at\r\nBrienne[7]. In other letters which are undoubtedly genuine, he refers\r\nto his future career with ardour, and writes not a word as to the\r\nbullying to which his Corsican zeal subjected him. Particularly\r\nnoteworthy is the letter to his uncle begging him to intervene so as\r\nto prevent Joseph Buonaparte from taking up a military career. Joseph,\r\nwrites the younger brother, would make a good garrison officer, as he\r\nwas well formed and clever at frivolous compliments--\"good therefore\r\nfor society, but for a fight--?\"\r\n\r\nNapoleon's determination had been noticed by his teachers. They had\r\nfailed to bend his will, at least on important points. In lesser\r\ndetails his Italian adroitness seems to have been of service; for the\r\nofficer who inspected the school reported of him: \"Constitution,\r\nhealth excellent: character submissive, sweet, honest, grateful:\r\nconduct very regular: has always distinguished himself by his\r\napplication to mathematics: knows history and geography passably: very\r\nweak in accomplishments. He will be an excellent seaman: is worthy to\r\nenter the School at Paris.\" To the military school at Paris he was\r\naccordingly sent in due course, entering there in October, 1784. The\r\nchange from the semi-monastic life at Brienne to the splendid edifice\r\nwhich fronts the Champ de Mars had less effect than might have\r\nbeen expected in a youth of fifteen years. Not yet did he become\r\nFrench in sympathy. His love of Corsica and hatred of the French\r\nmonarchy steeled him against the luxuries of his new surroundings.\r\nPerhaps it was an added sting that he was educated at the expense of\r\nthe monarchy which had conquered his kith and kin. He nevertheless\r\napplied himself with energy to his favourite studies, especially\r\nmathematics. Defective in languages he still was, and ever remained;\r\nfor his critical acumen in literature ever fastened on the matter\r\nrather than on style. To the end of his days he could never write\r\nItalian, much less French, with accuracy; and his tutor at Paris not\r\ninaptly described his boyish composition as resembling molten granite.\r\nThe same qualities of directness and impetuosity were also fatal to\r\nhis efforts at mastering the movements of the dance. In spite of\r\nlessons at Paris and private lessons which he afterwards took at\r\nValence, he was never a dancer: his bent was obviously for the exact\r\nsciences rather than the arts, for the geometrical rather than the\r\nrhythmical: he thought, as he moved, in straight lines, never in\r\ncurves.\r\n\r\nThe death of his father during the year which the youth spent at Paris\r\nsharpened his sense of responsibility towards his seven younger\r\nbrothers and sisters. His own poverty must have inspired him with\r\ndisgust at the luxury which he saw around him; but there are good\r\nreasons for doubting the genuineness of the memorial which he is\r\nalleged to have sent from Paris to the second master at Brienne on\r\nthis subject. The letters of the scholars at Paris were subject to\r\nstrict surveillance; and, if he had taken the trouble to draw up a\r\nlist of criticisms on his present training, most assuredly it would\r\nhave been destroyed. Undoubtedly, however, he would have sympathized\r\nwith the unknown critic in his complaint of the unsuitableness of\r\nsumptuous meals to youths who were destined for the hardships of the\r\ncamp. At Brienne he had been dubbed \"the Spartan,\" an instance of that\r\nalmost uncanny faculty of schoolboys to dash off in a nickname the\r\nsalient features of character. The phrase was correct, almost for\r\nNapoleon's whole life. At any rate, the pomp of Paris served but to\r\nroot his youthful affections more tenaciously in the rocks of Corsica.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1785, that is, at the age of sixteen, Buonaparte was\r\nnominated for a commission as junior lieutenant in La Fère regiment of\r\nartillery quartered at Valence on the Rhone. This was his first close\r\ncontact with real life. The rules of the service required him to\r\nspend three months of rigorous drill before he was admitted to his\r\ncommission. The work was exacting: the pay was small, viz., 1,120\r\nfrancs, or less than £45, a year; but all reports agree as to his keen\r\nzest for his profession and the recognition of his transcendent\r\nabilities by his superior officers.[8] There it was that he mastered\r\nthe rudiments of war, for lack of which many generals of noble birth\r\nhave quickly closed in disaster careers that began with promise:\r\nthere, too, he learnt that hardest and best of all lessons, prompt\r\nobedience. \"To learn obeying is the fundamental art of governing,\"\r\nsays Carlyle. It was so with Napoleon: at Valence he served his\r\napprenticeship in the art of conquering and the art of governing.\r\n\r\nThis spring-time of his life is of interest and importance in many\r\nways: it reveals many amiable qualities, which had hitherto been\r\nblighted by the real or fancied scorn of the wealthy cadets. At\r\nValence, while shrinking from his brother officers, he sought society\r\nmore congenial to his simple tastes and restrained demeanour. In a few\r\nof the best bourgeois families of Valence he found happiness. There,\r\ntoo, blossomed the tenderest, purest idyll of his life. At the country\r\nhouse of a cultured lady who had befriended him in his solitude, he\r\nsaw his first love, Caroline de Colombier. It was a passing fancy;\r\nbut to her all the passion of his southern nature welled forth. She\r\nseems to have returned his love; for in the stormy sunset of his life\r\nat St. Helena he recalled some delicious walks at dawn when Caroline\r\nand he had--eaten cherries together. One lingers fondly over these\r\nscenes of his otherwise stern career, for they reveal his capacity for\r\nsocial joys and for deep and tender affection, had his lot been\r\notherwise cast. How different might have been his life, had France\r\nnever conquered Corsica, and had the Revolution never burst forth! But\r\nCorsica was still his dominant passion. When he was called away from\r\nValence to repress a riot at Lyons, his feelings, distracted for a\r\ntime by Caroline, swerved back towards his island home; and in\r\nSeptember, 1786, he had the joy of revisiting the scenes of his\r\nchildhood. Warmly though he greeted his mother, brothers and sisters,\r\nafter an absence of nearly eight years, his chief delight was in the\r\nrocky shores, the verdant dales and mountain heights of Corsica. The\r\nodour of the forests, the setting of the sun in the sea \"as in the\r\nbosom of the infinite,\" the quiet proud independence of the\r\nmountaineers themselves, all enchanted him. His delight reveals almost\r\nWertherian powers of \"sensibility.\" Even the family troubles could not\r\ndamp his ardour. His father had embarked on questionable speculations,\r\nwhich now threatened the Buonapartes with bankruptcy, unless the\r\nFrench Government proved to be complacent and generous. With the hope\r\nof pressing one of the family claims on the royal exchequer, the\r\nsecond son procured an extension of furlough and sped to Paris. There\r\nat the close of 1787 he spent several weeks, hopefully endeavouring to\r\nextract money from the bankrupt Government. It was a season of\r\ndisillusionment in more senses than one; for there he saw for himself\r\nthe seamy side of Parisian life, and drifted for a brief space about\r\nthe giddy vortex of the Palais Royal. What a contrast to the limpid\r\nlife of Corsica was that turbid frothy existence--already swirling\r\ntowards its mighty plunge!\r\n\r\nAfter a furlough of twenty-one months he rejoined his regiment, now at\r\nAuxonne. There his health suffered considerably, not only from the\r\nmiasma of the marshes of the river Saône, but also from family\r\nanxieties and arduous literary toils. To these last it is now needful\r\nto refer. Indeed, the external events of his early life are of value\r\nonly as they reveal the many-sidedness of his nature and the growth of\r\nhis mental powers.\r\n\r\nHow came he to outgrow the insular patriotism of his early years? The\r\nforegoing recital of facts must have already suggested one obvious\r\nexplanation. Nature had dowered him so prodigally with diverse gifts,\r\nmainly of an imperious order, that he could scarcely have limited his\r\nsphere of action to Corsica. Profoundly as he loved his island, it\r\noffered no sphere commensurate with his varied powers and masterful\r\nwill. It was no empty vaunt which his father had uttered on his\r\ndeathbed that his Napoleon would one day overthrow the old monarchies\r\nand conquer Europe.[9] Neither did the great commander himself\r\noverstate the peculiarity of his temperament, when he confessed that\r\nhis instincts had ever prompted him that his will must prevail, and\r\nthat what pleased him must of necessity belong to him. Most spoilt\r\nchildren harbour the same illusion, for a brief space. But all the\r\nbuffetings of fortune failed to drive it from the young Buonaparte;\r\nand when despair as to his future might have impaired the vigour of\r\nhis domineering instincts, his mind and will acquired a fresh rigidity\r\nby coming under the spell of that philosophizing doctrinaire,\r\nRousseau.\r\n\r\nThere was every reason why he should early be attracted by this\r\nfantastic thinker. In that notable work, \"Le Contrat Social\" (1762),\r\nRousseau called attention to the antique energy shown by the Corsicans\r\nin defence of their liberties, and in a startlingly prophetic phrase\r\nhe exclaimed that the little island would one day astonish Europe. The\r\nsource of this predilection of Rousseau for Corsica is patent. Born\r\nand reared at Geneva, he felt a Switzer's love for a people which was<\r\n\"neither rich nor poor but self-sufficing \"; and in the simple life\r\nand fierce love of liberty of the hardy islanders he saw traces of\r\nthat social contract which he postulated as the basis of society.\r\nAccording to him, the beginnings of all social and political\r\ninstitutions are to be found in some agreement or contract between\r\nmen. Thus arise the clan, the tribe, the nation. The nation may\r\ndelegate many of its powers to a ruler; but if he abuse such powers,\r\nthe contract between him and his people is at an end, and they may\r\nreturn to the primitive state, which is founded on an agreement of\r\nequals with equals. Herein lay the attractiveness of Rousseau for all\r\nwho were discontented with their surroundings. He seemed infallibly\r\nto demonstrate the absurdity of tyranny and the need of returning to\r\nthe primitive bliss of the social contract. It mattered not that the\r\nsaid contract was utterly unhistorical and that his argument teemed\r\nwith fallacies. He inspired a whole generation with detestation of the\r\npresent and with longings for the golden age. Poets had sung of it,\r\nbut Rousseau seemed to bring it within the grasp of long-suffering\r\nmortals.\r\n\r\nThe first extant manuscript of Napoleon, written at Valence in April,\r\n1786, shows that he sought in Rousseau's armoury the logical weapons\r\nfor demonstrating the \"right\" of the Corsicans to rebel against the\r\nFrench. The young hero-worshipper begins by noting that it is the\r\nbirthday of Paoli. He plunges into a panegyric on the Corsican\r\npatriots, when he is arrested by the thought that many censure them\r\nfor rebelling at all. \"The divine laws forbid revolt. But what have\r\ndivine laws to do with a purely human affair? Just think of the\r\nabsurdity--divine laws universally forbidding the casting off of a\r\nusurping yoke! ... As for human laws, there cannot be any after the\r\nprince violates them.\" He then postulates two origins for government\r\nas alone possible. Either the people has established laws and\r\nsubmitted itself to the prince, or the prince has established laws. In\r\nthe first case, the prince is engaged by the very nature of his office\r\nto execute the covenants. In the second case, the laws tend, or do not\r\ntend, to the welfare of the people, which is the aim of all\r\ngovernment: if they do not, the contract with the prince dissolves of\r\nitself, for the people then enters again into its primitive state.\r\nHaving thus proved the sovereignty of the people, Buonaparte uses his\r\ndoctrine to justify Corsican revolt against France, and thus concludes\r\nhis curious medley: \"The Corsicans, following all the laws of justice,\r\nhave been able to shake off the yoke of the Genoese, and may do the\r\nsame with that of the French. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nFive days later he again gives the reins to his melancholy. \"Always\r\nalone, though in the midst of men,\" he faces the thought of suicide.\r\nWith an innate power of summarizing and balancing thoughts and\r\nsensations, he draws up arguments for and against this act. He is in\r\nthe dawn of his days and in four months' time he will see \"la patrie,\"\r\nwhich he has not seen since childhood. What joy! And yet--how men have\r\nfallen away from nature: how cringing are his compatriots to their\r\nconquerors: they are no longer the enemies of tyrants, of luxury, of\r\nvile courtiers: the French have corrupted their morals, and when \"la\r\npatrie\" no longer survives, a good patriot ought to die. Life among\r\nthe French is odious: their modes of life differ from his as much as\r\nthe light of the moon differs from that of the sun.--A strange\r\neffusion this for a youth of seventeen living amidst the full glories\r\nof the spring in Dauphiné. It was only a few weeks before the ripening\r\nof cherries. Did that cherry-idyll with Mdlle. de Colombier lure him\r\nback to life? Or did the hope of striking a blow for Corsica stay his\r\nsuicidal hand? Probably the latter; for we find him shortly afterwards\r\ntilting against a Protestant minister of Geneva who had ventured to\r\ncriticise one of the dogmas of Rousseau's evangel.\r\n\r\nThe Genevan philosopher had asserted that Christianity, by enthroning\r\nin the hearts of Christians the idea of a Kingdom not of this world,\r\nbroke the unity of civil society, because it detached the hearts of\r\nits converts from the State, as from all earthly things. To this the\r\nGenevan minister had successfully replied by quoting Christian\r\nteachings on the subject at issue. But Buonaparte fiercely accuses\r\nthe pastor of neither having understood, nor even read, \"Le Contrat\r\nSocial\": he hurls at his opponent texts of Scripture which enjoin\r\nobedience to the laws: he accuses Christianity of rendering men slaves\r\nto an anti-social tyranny, because its priests set up an authority in\r\nopposition to civil laws; and as for Protestantism, it propagated\r\ndiscords between its followers, and thereby violated civic unity.\r\nChristianity, he argues, is a foe to civil government, for it aims at\r\nmaking men happy in this life by inspiring them with hope of a future\r\nlife; while the aim of civil government is \"to lend assistance to the\r\nfeeble against the strong, and by this means to allow everyone to\r\nenjoy a sweet tranquillity, the road of happiness.\" He therefore\r\nconcludes that Christianity and civil government are diametrically\r\nopposed.\r\n\r\nIn this tirade we see the youth's spirit of revolt flinging him not\r\nonly against French law, but against the religion which sanctions it.\r\nHe sees none of the beauty of the Gospels which Rousseau had\r\nadmitted. His views are more rigid than those of his teacher.\r\nScarcely can he conceive of two influences, the spiritual and the\r\ngovernmental, working on parallel lines, on different parts of man's\r\nnature. His conception of human society is that of an indivisible,\r\nindistinguishable whole, wherein materialism, tinged now and again by\r\nreligious sentiment and personal honour, is the sole noteworthy\r\ninfluence. He finds no worth in a religion which seeks to work from\r\nwithin to without, which aims at transforming character, and thus\r\ntransforming the world. In its headlong quest of tangible results his\r\neager spirit scorns so tardy a method: he will \"compel men to be\r\nhappy,\" and for this result there is but one practicable means, the\r\nSocial Contract, the State. Everything which mars the unity of the\r\nSocial Contract shall be shattered, so that the State may have a clear\r\nfield for the exercise of its beneficent despotism. Such is\r\nBuonaparte's political and religious creed at the age of seventeen,\r\nand such it remained (with many reservations suggested by maturer\r\nthought and self-interest) to the end of his days. It reappears in his\r\npolicy anent the Concordat of 1802, by which religion was reduced to\r\nthe level of handmaid to the State, as also in his frequent assertions\r\nthat he would never have quite the same power as the Czar and the\r\nSultan, because he had not undivided sway over the consciences of his\r\npeople.[10] In this boyish essay we may perhaps discern the\r\nfundamental reason of his later failures. He never completely\r\nunderstood religion, or the enthusiasm which it can evoke; neither did\r\nhe ever fully realize the complexity of human nature, the\r\nmany-sidedness of social life, and the limitations that beset the\r\naction even of the most intelligent law-maker.[11]\r\n\r\nHis reading of Rousseau having equipped him for the study of human\r\nsociety and government, he now, during his first sojourn at Auxonne\r\n(June, 1788--September, 1789), proceeds to ransack the records of the\r\nancient and modern world. Despite ill-health, family troubles, and the\r\noutbreak of the French Revolution, he grapples with this portentous\r\ntask. The history, geography, religion, and social customs of the\r\nancient Persians, Scythians, Thracians, Athenians, Spartans,\r\nEgyptians, and Carthaginians--all furnished materials for his\r\nencyclopædic note-books. Nothing came amiss to his summarizing genius.\r\nHere it was that he gained that knowledge of the past which was to\r\nastonish his contemporaries. Side by side with suggestions on\r\nregimental discipline and improvements in artillery, we find notes on\r\nthe opening episodes of Plato's \"Republic,\" and a systematic summary\r\nof English history from the earliest times down to the Revolution of\r\n1688. This last event inspired him with special interest, because the\r\nWhigs and their philosophic champion, Locke, maintained that James II.\r\nhad violated the original contract between prince and people.\r\nEverywhere in his notes Napoleon emphasizes the incidents which led to\r\nconflicts between dynasties or between rival principles. In fact,\r\nthrough all these voracious studies there appear signs of his\r\ndetermination to write a history of Corsica; and, while inspiriting\r\nhis kinsmen by recalling the glorious past, he sought to weaken the\r\nFrench monarchy by inditing a \"Dissertation sur l'Autorité Royale.\"\r\nHis first sketch of this work runs as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"23 October, 1788. Auxonne.\r\n\r\n     \"This work will begin with general ideas as to the origin and the\r\n     enhanced prestige of the name of king. Military rule is favourable\r\n     to it: this work will afterwards enter into the details of the\r\n     usurped authority enjoyed by the Kings of the twelve Kingdoms of\r\n     Europe.\r\n\r\n     \"There are very few Kings who have not deserved dethronement[12].\"\r\n\r\nThis curt pronouncement is all that remains of the projected work. It\r\nsufficiently indicates, however, the aim of Napoleon's studies. One\r\nand all they were designed to equip him for the great task of\r\nre-awakening the spirit of the Corsicans and of sapping the base of\r\nthe French monarchy.\r\n\r\nBut these reams of manuscript notes and crude literary efforts have an\r\neven wider source of interest. They show how narrow was his outlook on\r\nlife. It all turned on the regeneration of Corsica by methods which he\r\nhimself prescribed. We are therefore able to understand why, when his\r\nown methods of salvation for Corsica were rejected, he tore himself\r\naway and threw his undivided energies into the Revolution.\r\n\r\nYet the records of his early life show that in his character there was\r\na strain of true sentiment and affection. In him Nature carved out a\r\ncharacter of rock-like firmness, but she adorned it with flowers of\r\nhuman sympathy and tendrils of family love. At his first parting from\r\nhis brother Joseph at Autun, when the elder brother was weeping\r\npassionately, the little Napoleon dropped a tear: but that, said the\r\ntutor, meant as much as the flood of tears from Joseph. Love of his\r\nrelatives was a potent factor of his policy in later life; and slander\r\nhas never been able wholly to blacken the character of a man who loved\r\nand honoured his mother, who asserted that her advice had often been\r\nof the highest service to him, and that her justice and firmness of\r\nspirit marked her out as a natural ruler of men. But when these\r\nadmissions are freely granted, it still remains true that his\r\ncharacter was naturally hard; that his sense of personal superiority\r\nmade him, even as a child, exacting and domineering; and the sequel\r\nwas to show that even the strongest passion of his youth, his\r\ndetermination to free Corsica from France, could be abjured if\r\noccasion demanded, all the force of his nature being thenceforth\r\nconcentrated on vaster adventures.\r\n\r\n       *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND CORSICA\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They seek to destroy the Revolution by attacking my person: I will\r\ndefend it, for I am the Revolution.\" Such were the words uttered by\r\nBuonaparte after the failure of the royalist plot of 1804. They are a\r\ndaring transcript of Louis XIV.'s \"L'état, c'est moi.\" That was a bold\r\nclaim, even for an age attuned to the whims of autocrats: but this of\r\nthe young Corsican is even more daring, for he thereby equated himself\r\nwith a movement which claimed to be wide as humanity and infinite as\r\ntruth. And yet when he spoke these words, they were not scouted as\r\npresumptuous folly: to most Frenchmen they seemed sober truth and\r\npractical good sense. How came it, one asks in wonder, that after the\r\nshort space of fifteen years a world-wide movement depended on a\r\nsingle life, that the infinitudes of 1789 lived on only in the form,\r\nand by the pleasure, of the First Consul? Here surely is a political\r\nincarnation unparalleled in the whole course of human history. The\r\nriddle cannot be solved by history alone. It belongs in part to the\r\ndomain of psychology, when that science shall undertake the study, not\r\nmerely of man as a unit, but of the aspirations, moods, and whims of\r\ncommunities and nations. Meanwhile it will be our far humbler task to\r\nstrive to point out the relation of Buonaparte to the Revolution, and\r\nto show how the mighty force of his will dragged it to earth.\r\n\r\nThe first questions that confront us are obviously these. Were the\r\nlofty aims and aspirations of the Revolution attainable? And, if so,\r\ndid the men of 1789 follow them by practical methods? To the former of\r\nthese questions the present chapter will, in part at least, serve as\r\nan answer. On the latter part of the problem the events described in\r\nlater chapters will throw some light: in them we shall see that the\r\ngreat popular upheaval let loose mighty forces that bore Buonaparte on\r\nto fortune.\r\n\r\nHere we may notice that the Revolution was not a simple and therefore\r\nsolid movement. It was complex and contained the seeds of discord\r\nwhich lurk in many-sided and militant creeds. The theories of its\r\nintellectual champions were as diverse as the motives which spurred on\r\ntheir followers to the attack on the outworn abuses of the age.\r\n\r\nDiscontent and faith were the ultimate motive powers of the\r\nRevolution. Faith prepared the Revolution and discontent accomplished\r\nit. Idealists who, in varied planes of thought, preached the doctrine\r\nof human perfectibility, succeeded in slowly permeating the dull\r\ntoiling masses of France with hope. Omitting here any notice of\r\nphilosophic speculation as such, we may briefly notice the teachings\r\nof three writers whose influence on revolutionary politics was to be\r\ndefinite and practical. These were Montesquieu, Voltaire, and\r\nRousseau. The first was by no means a revolutionist, for he decided in\r\nfavour of a mixed form of government, like that of England, which\r\nguaranteed the State against the dangers of autocracy, oligarchy, and\r\nmob-rule. Only by a ricochet did he assail the French monarchy. But he\r\nre-awakened critical inquiry; and any inquiry was certain to sap the\r\nbase of the _ancien régime_ in France. Montesquieu's teaching inspired\r\nthe group of moderate reformers who in 1789 desired to re-fashion the\r\ninstitutions of France on the model of those of England. But popular\r\nsentiment speedily swept past these Anglophils towards the more\r\nattractive aims set forth by Voltaire.\r\n\r\nThis keen thinker subjected the privileged classes, especially the\r\ntitled clergy, to a searching fire of philosophic bombs and barbed\r\nwitticisms. Never was there a more dazzling succession of literary\r\ntriumphs over a tottering system. The satirized classes winced and\r\nlaughed, and the intellect of France was conquered, for the\r\nRevolution. Thenceforth it was impossible that peasants who were\r\nnominally free should toil to satisfy the exacting needs of the\r\nState, and to support the brilliant bevy of nobles who flitted gaily\r\nround the monarch at Versailles. The young King Louis XVI., it is\r\ntrue, carried through several reforms, but he had not enough strength\r\nof will to abolish the absurd immunities from taxation which freed the\r\nnobles and titled clergy from the burdens of the State. Thus, down to\r\n1789, the middle classes and peasants bore nearly all the weight of\r\ntaxation, while the peasants were also encumbered by feudal dues and\r\ntolls. These were the crying grievances which united in a solid\r\nphalanx both thinkers and practical men, and thereby gave an immense\r\nimpetus to the levelling doctrines of Rousseau.\r\n\r\nTwo only of his political teachings concern us here, namely, social\r\nequality and the unquestioned supremacy of the State; for to these\r\ndogmas, when they seemed doomed to political bankruptcy, Napoleon\r\nBuonaparte was to act as residuary legatee. According to Rousseau,\r\nsociety and government originated in a social contract, whereby all\r\nmembers of the community have equal rights. It matters not that the\r\nspirit of the contract may have evaporated amidst the miasma of\r\nluxury. That is a violation of civil society; and members are\r\njustified in reverting at once to the primitive ideal. If the\r\nexistence of the body politic be endangered, force may be used:\r\n\"Whoever refuses to obey the general will shall be constrained to do\r\nso by the whole body; which means nothing else than that he shall be\r\nforced to be free.\" Equally plausible and dangerous was his teaching\r\nas to the indivisibility of the general will. Deriving every public\r\npower from his social contract, he finds it easy to prove that the\r\nsovereign power, vested in all the citizens, must be incorruptible,\r\ninalienable, unrepresentable, indivisible, and indestructible.\r\nEnglishmen may now find it difficult to understand the enthusiasm\r\ncalled forth by this quintessence of negations; but to Frenchman\r\nrecently escaped from the age of privilege and warring against the\r\ncoalition of kings, the cry of the Republic one and indivisible was a\r\ntrumpet call to death or victory. Any shifts, even that of a\r\ndictatorship, were to be borne, provided that social equality could be\r\nsaved. As republican Rome had saved her early liberties by intrusting\r\nunlimited powers to a temporary dictator, so, claimed Rousseau, a\r\nyoung commonwealth must by a similar device consult Nature's first law\r\nof self-preservation. The dictator saves liberty by temporarily\r\nabrogating it: by momentary gagging of the legislative power he\r\nrenders it truly vocal.\r\n\r\nThe events of the French Revolution form a tragic commentary on these\r\ntheories. In the first stage of that great movement we see the\r\nfollowers of Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Rousseau marching in an\r\nundivided host against the ramparts of privilege. The walls of the\r\nBastille fall down even at the blast of their trumpets. Odious feudal\r\nprivileges disappear in a single sitting of the National Assembly; and\r\nthe _Parlements_, or supreme law courts of the provinces, are swept\r\naway. The old provinces themselves are abolished, and at the beginning\r\nof 1790 France gains social and political unity by her new system of\r\nDepartments, which grants full freedom of action in local affairs,\r\nthough in all national concerns it binds France closely to the new\r\npopular government at Paris. But discords soon begin to divide the\r\nreformers: hatred of clerical privilege and the desire to fill the\r\nempty coffers of the State dictate the first acts of spoliation.\r\nTithes are abolished: the lands of the Church are confiscated to the\r\nservice of the State; monastic orders are suppressed; and the\r\nGovernment undertakes to pay the stipends of bishops and priests.\r\nFurthermore, their subjection to the State is definitely secured by\r\nthe Civil Constitution of the Clergy (July, 1790) which invalidates\r\ntheir allegiance to the Pope. Most of the clergy refuse: these are\r\ntermed non-jurors or orthodox priests, while their more complaisant\r\ncolleagues are known as constitutional priests. Hence arises a serious\r\nschism in the Church, which distracts the religious life of the land,\r\nand separates the friends of liberty from the champions of the\r\nrigorous equality preached by Rousseau.\r\n\r\nThe new constitution of 1791 was also a source of discord. In its\r\njealousy of the royal authority, the National Assembly seized very\r\nmany of the executive functions of government. The results were\r\ndisastrous. Laws remained without force, taxes went uncollected, the\r\narmy was distracted by mutinies, and the monarchy sank slowly into the\r\ngulf of bankruptcy and anarchy. Thus, in the course of three years,\r\nthe revolutionists goaded the clergy to desperation, they were about\r\nto overthrow the monarchy, every month was proving their local\r\nself-government to be unworkable, and they themselves split into\r\nfactions that plunged France into war and drenched her soil by\r\norganized massacres.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe know very little about the impression made on the young Buonaparte\r\nby the first events of the Revolution. His note-book seems even to\r\nshow that he regarded them as an inconvenient interference with his\r\nplans for Corsica. But gradually the Revolution excites his interest.\r\nIn September, 1789, we find him on furlough in Corsica sharing the\r\nhopes of the islanders that their representatives in the French\r\nNational Assembly will obtain the boon of independence. He exhorts\r\nhis compatriots to favour the democratic cause, which promises a\r\nspeedy deliverance from official abuses. He urges them to don the new\r\ntricolour cockade, symbol of Parisian triumph over the old monarchy;\r\nto form a club; above all, to organize a National Guard. The young\r\nofficer knew that military power was passing from the royal army, now\r\nhoneycombed with discontent, to the National Guard. Here surely was\r\nCorsica's means of salvation. But the French governor of Corsica\r\nintervenes. The club is closed, and the National Guard is dispersed.\r\nThereupon Buonaparte launches a vigorous protest against the tyranny\r\nof the governor and appeals to the National Assembly of France for\r\nsome guarantee of civil liberty. His name is at the head of this\r\npetition, a sufficiently daring step for a junior lieutenant on\r\nfurlough. But his patriotism and audacity carry him still further. He\r\njourneys to Bastia, the official capital of his island, and is\r\nconcerned in an affray between the populace and the royal troops\r\n(November 5th, 1789). The French authorities, fortunately for him, are\r\nnearly powerless: he is merely requested to return to Ajaccio; and\r\nthere he organizes anew the civic force, and sets the dissident\r\nislanders an example of good discipline by mounting guard outside the\r\nhouse of a personal opponent.\r\n\r\nOther events now transpired which began to assuage his opposition to\r\nFrance. Thanks to the eloquent efforts of Mirabeau, the Corsican\r\npatriots who had remained in exile since 1768 were allowed to return\r\nand enjoy the full rights of citizenship. Little could the friends of\r\nliberty at Paris, or even the statesman himself, have foreseen all the\r\nconsequences of this action: it softened the feelings of many\r\nCorsicans towards their conquerors; above all, it caused the heart of\r\nNapoleon Buonaparte for the first time to throb in accord with that of\r\nthe French nation. His feelings towards Paoli also began to cool. The\r\nconduct of this illustrious exile exposed him to the charge of\r\ningratitude towards France. The decree of the French National\r\nAssembly, which restored him to Corsican citizenship, was graced by\r\nacts of courtesy such as the generous French nature can so winningly\r\ndispense. Louis XVI. and the National Assembly warmly greeted him, and\r\nrecognized him as head of the National Guard of the island. Yet,\r\namidst all the congratulations, Paoli saw the approach of anarchy, and\r\nbehaved with some reserve. Outwardly, however, concord seemed to be\r\nassured, when on July 14th, 1790, he landed in Corsica; but the hatred\r\nlong nursed by the mountaineers and fisherfolk against France was not\r\nto be exorcised by a few demonstrations. In truth, the island was\r\ndeeply agitated. The priests were rousing the people against the newly\r\ndecreed Civil Constitution of the Clergy; and one of these\r\ndisturbances endangered the life of Napoleon himself. He and his\r\nbrother Joseph chanced to pass by when one of the processions of\r\npriests and devotees was exciting the pity and indignation of the\r\ntownsfolk. The two brothers, who were now well known as partisans of\r\nthe Revolution, were threatened with violence, and were saved only by\r\ntheir own firm demeanour and the intervention of peacemakers.\r\n\r\nThen again, the concession of local self-government to the island, as\r\none of the Departments of France, revealed unexpected difficulties.\r\nBastia and Ajaccio struggled hard for the honour of being the official\r\ncapital. Paoli favoured the claims of Bastia, thereby annoying the\r\nchampions of Ajaccio, among whom the Buonapartes were prominent. The\r\nschism was widened by the dictatorial tone of Paoli, a demeanour which\r\nill became the chief of a civic force. In fact, it soon became\r\napparent that Corsica was too small a sphere for natures so able and\r\nmasterful as those of Paoli and Napoleon Buonaparte.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting of these two men must have been a scene of deep\r\ninterest. It was on the fatal field of Ponte Nuovo. Napoleon doubtless\r\ncame there in the spirit of true hero-worship. But hero-worship which\r\ncan stand the strain of actual converse is rare indeed, especially\r\nwhen the expectant devotee is endowed with keen insight and habits of\r\ntrenchant expression. One phrase has come down to us as a result of\r\nthe interview; but this phrase contains a volume of meaning. After\r\nPaoli had explained the disposition of his troops against the French\r\nat Ponte Nuovo, Buonaparte drily remarked to his brother Joseph, \"The\r\nresult of these dispositions was what was inevitable.\" [13]\r\n\r\nFor the present, Buonaparte and other Corsican democrats were closely\r\nconcerned with the delinquencies of the Comte de Buttafuoco, the\r\ndeputy for the twelve nobles of the island to the National Assembly of\r\nFrance. In a letter written on January 23rd, 1791, Buonaparte\r\noverwhelms this man with a torrent of invective.--He it was who had\r\nbetrayed his country to France in 1768. Self-interest and that alone\r\nprompted his action then, and always. French rule was a cloak for his\r\ndesign of subjecting Corsica to \"the absurd feudal _régime_\" of the\r\nbarons. In his selfish royalism he had protested against the new\r\nFrench constitution as being unsuited to Corsica, \"though it was\r\nexactly the same as that which brought us so much good and was wrested\r\nfrom us only amidst streams of blood.\"--The letter is remarkable for\r\nthe southern intensity of its passion, and for a certain hardening of\r\ntone towards Paoli. Buonaparte writes of Paoli as having been ever\r\n\"surrounded by enthusiasts, and as failing to understand in a man any\r\nother passion than fanaticism for liberty and independence,\" and as\r\nduped by Buttafuoco in 1768.[14] The phrase has an obvious reference\r\nto the Paoli of 1791, surrounded by men who had shared his long exile\r\nand regarded the English constitution as their model. Buonaparte, on\r\nthe contrary, is the accredited champion of French democracy, his\r\nfurious epistle being printed by the Jacobin Club of Ajaccio.\r\n\r\nAfter firing off this tirade Buonaparte returned to his regiment at\r\nAuxonne (February, 1791). It was high time; for his furlough, though\r\nprolonged on the plea of ill-health, had expired in the preceding\r\nOctober, and he was therefore liable to six months' imprisonment. But\r\nthe young officer rightly gauged the weakness of the moribund\r\nmonarchy; and the officers of his almost mutinous regiment were glad\r\nto get him back on any terms. Everywhere in his journey through\r\nProvence and Dauphiné, Buonaparte saw the triumph of revolutionary\r\nprinciples. He notes that the peasants are to a man for the\r\nRevolution; so are the rank and file of the regiment. The officers\r\nare aristocrats, along with three-fourths of those who belong to \"good\r\nsociety\": so are all the women, for \"Liberty is fairer than they, and\r\neclipses them.\" The Revolution was evidently gaining completer hold\r\nover his mind and was somewhat blurring his insular sentiments, when a\r\nrebuff from Paoli further weakened his ties to Corsica. Buonaparte had\r\ndedicated to him his work on Corsica, and had sent him the manuscript\r\nfor his approval. After keeping it an unconscionable time, the old man\r\nnow coldly replied that he did not desire the honour of Buonaparte's\r\npanegyric, though he thanked him heartily for it; that the\r\nconsciousness of having done his duty sufficed for him in his old age;\r\nand, for the rest, history should not be written in youth. A further\r\nrequest from Joseph Buonaparte for the return of the slighted\r\nmanuscript brought the answer that he, Paoli, had no time to search\r\nhis papers. After this, how could hero-worship subsist?\r\n\r\nThe four months spent by Buonaparte at Auxonne were, indeed, a time of\r\ndisappointment and hardship. Out of his slender funds he paid for the\r\neducation of his younger brother, Louis, who shared his otherwise\r\ndesolate lodging. A room almost bare but for a curtainless bed, a\r\ntable heaped with books and papers, and two chairs--such were the\r\nsurroundings of the lieutenant in the spring of 1791. He lived on\r\nbread that he might rear his brother for the army, and that he might\r\nbuy books, overjoyed when his savings mounted to the price of some\r\ncoveted volume.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the depressing conditions of his life at Auxonne may account\r\nfor the acrid tone of an essay which he there wrote in competition for\r\na prize offered by the Academy of Lyons on the subject--\"What truths\r\nand sentiments ought to be inculcated to men for their happiness.\" It\r\nwas unsuccessful; and modern readers will agree with the verdict of\r\none of the judges that it was incongruous in arrangement and of a bad\r\nand ragged style. The thoughts are set forth in jerky, vehement\r\nclauses; and, in place of the _sensibilité_ of some of his earlier\r\neffusions, we feel here the icy breath of materialism. He regards an\r\nideal human society as a geometrical structure based on certain\r\nwell-defined postulates. All men ought to be able to satisfy certain\r\nelementary needs of their nature; but all that is beyond is\r\nquestionable or harmful. The ideal legislator will curtail wealth so\r\nas to restore the wealthy to their true nature--and so forth. Of any\r\ngenerous outlook on the wider possibilities of human life there is\r\nscarcely a trace. His essay is the apotheosis of social mediocrity. By\r\nProcrustean methods he would have forced mankind back to the dull\r\nlevels of Sparta: the opalescent glow of Athenian life was beyond his\r\nken. But perhaps the most curious passage is that in which he preaches\r\nagainst the sin and folly of ambition. He pictures Ambition as a\r\nfigure with pallid cheeks, wild eyes, hasty step, jerky movements and\r\nsardonic smile, for whom crimes are a sport, while lies and calumnies\r\nare merely arguments and figures of speech. Then, in words that recall\r\nJuvenal's satire on Hannibal's career, he continues: \"What is\r\nAlexander doing when he rushes from Thebes into Persia and thence into\r\nIndia? He is ever restless, he loses his wits, he believes himself\r\nGod. What is the end of Cromwell? He governs England. But is he not\r\ntormented by all the daggers of the furies?\"--The words ring false,\r\neven for this period of Buonaparte's life; and one can readily\r\nunderstand his keen wish in later years to burn every copy of these\r\nyouthful essays. But they have nearly all survived; and the diatribe\r\nagainst ambition itself supplies the feather wherewith history may\r\nwing her shaft at the towering flight of the imperial eagle.[15]\r\n\r\nAt midsummer he is transferred, as first lieutenant, to another\r\nregiment which happened to be quartered at Valence; but his second\r\nsojourn there is remarkable only for signs of increasing devotion to\r\nthe revolutionary cause. In the autumn of 1791 he is again in Corsica\r\non furlough, and remains there until the month of May following. He\r\nfinds the island rent by strifes which it would be tedious to\r\ndescribe. Suffice it to say that the breach between Paoli and the\r\nBuonapartes gradually widened owing to the dictator's suspicion of all\r\nwho favoured the French Revolution. The young officer certainly did\r\nnothing to close the breach. Determined to secure his own election as\r\nlieutenant-colonel in the new Corsican National Guard, he spent much\r\ntime in gaining recruits who would vote for him. He further assured\r\nhis success by having one of the commissioners, who was acting in\r\nPaoli's interest, carried off from his friends and detained at the\r\nBuonapartes' house in Ajaccio--his first _coup_[16] Stranger events\r\nwere to follow. At Easter, when the people were excited by the\r\npersecuting edicts against the clergy and the closing of a monastery,\r\nthere was sharp fighting between the populace and Buonaparte's\r\ncompanies of National Guards. Originating in a petty quarrel, which\r\nwas taken up by eager partisans, it embroiled the whole of the town\r\nand gave the ardent young Jacobin the chance of overthrowing his\r\nenemies. His plans even extended to the seizure of the citadel, where\r\nhe tried to seduce the French regiment from its duty to officers\r\nwhom he dubbed aristocrats. The attempt was a failure. The whole\r\ntruth can, perhaps, scarcely be discerned amidst the tissue of\r\nlies which speedily enveloped the affair; but there can be no\r\ndoubt that on the second day of strife Buonaparte's National\r\nGuards began the fight and subsequently menaced the regular troops in\r\nthe citadel. The conflict was finally stopped by commissioners sent by\r\nPaoli; and the volunteers were sent away from the town.\r\n\r\nBuonaparte's position now seemed desperate. His conduct exposed him to\r\nthe hatred of most of his fellow-citizens and to the rebukes of the\r\nFrench War Department. In fact, he had doubly sinned: he had actually\r\nexceeded his furlough by four months: he was technically guilty, first\r\nof desertion, and secondly of treason. In ordinary times he would have\r\nbeen shot, but the times were extraordinary, and he rightly judged\r\nthat when a Continental war was brewing, the most daring course was\r\nalso the most prudent, namely, to go to Paris. Thither Paoli allowed\r\nhim to proceed, doubtless on the principle of giving the young madcap\r\na rope wherewith to hang himself.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at Marseilles, he hears that war has been declared by\r\nFrance against Austria; for the republican Ministry, which Louis XVI.\r\nhad recently been compelled to accept, believed that war against an\r\nabsolute monarch would intensify revolutionary fervour in France and\r\nhasten the advent of the Republic. Their surmises were correct.\r\nBuonaparte, on his arrival at Paris, witnessed the closing scenes of\r\nthe reign of Louis XVI. On June 20th he saw the crowd burst into the\r\nTuileries, when for some hours it insulted the king and queen. Warmly\r\nthough he had espoused the principles of the Revolution, his patrician\r\nblood boiled at the sight of these vulgar outrages, and he exclaimed:\r\n\"Why don't they sweep off four or five hundred of that _canaille_ with\r\ncannon? The rest would then run away fast enough.\" The remark is\r\nsignificant. If his brain approved the Jacobin creed, his instincts\r\nwere always with monarchy. His career was to reconcile his reason with\r\nhis instincts, and to impose on weary France the curious compromise of\r\na revolutionary Imperialism.\r\n\r\nOn August 10th, from the window of a shop near the Tuileries, he\r\nlooked down on the strange events which dealt the _coup de grâce_ to\r\nthe dying monarchy. Again the chieftain within him sided against the\r\nvulture rabble and with the well-meaning monarch who kept his troops\r\nto a tame defensive. \"If Louis XVI.\" (so wrote Buonaparte to his\r\nbrother Joseph) \"had mounted his horse, the victory would have been\r\nhis--so I judge from the spirit which prevailed in the morning.\"\r\nWhen all was over, when Louis sheathed his sword and went for\r\nshelter to the National Assembly, when the fierce Marseillais were\r\nslaughtering the Swiss Guards and bodyguards of the king, Buonaparte\r\ndashed forward to save one of these unfortunates from a southern\r\nsabre. \"Southern comrade, let us save this poor wretch.--Are you\r\nof the south?--Yes.--Well, we will save him.\"\r\n\r\nAltogether, what a time of disillusionment this was to the young\r\nofficer. What depths of cruelty and obscenity it revealed in the\r\nParisian rabble. What folly to treat them with the Christian\r\nforbearance shown by Louis XVI. How much more suitable was grapeshot\r\nthan the beatitudes. The lesson was stored up for future use at a\r\nsomewhat similar crisis on this very spot.\r\n\r\nDuring the few days when victorious Paris left Louis with the sham\r\ntitle of king, Buonaparte received his captain's commission, which was\r\nsigned for the king by Servan, the War Minister. Thus did the\r\nrevolutionary Government pass over his double breach of military\r\ndiscipline at Ajaccio. The revolutionary motto, \"La carrière ouverte\r\naux talents,\" was never more conspicuously illustrated than in the\r\nfacile condoning of his offences and in this rapid promotion. It was\r\nindeed a time fraught with vast possibilities for all republican or\r\nJacobinical officers. Their monarchist colleagues were streaming over\r\nthe frontiers to join the Austrian and Prussian invaders. But National\r\nGuards were enrolling by tens of thousands to drive out the Prussian\r\nand Austrian invaders; and when Europe looked to see France fall for\r\never, it saw with wonder her strength renewed as by enchantment. Later\r\non it learnt that that strength was the strength of Antæus, of a\r\npeasantry that stood firmly rooted in their native soil. Organization\r\nand good leadership alone were needed to transform these ardent masses\r\ninto the most formidable soldiery; and the brilliant military\r\nprospects now opened up certainly knit Buonaparte's feelings more\r\nclosely with the cause of France. Thus, on September 21st, when the\r\nnew National Assembly, known as the Convention, proclaimed the\r\nRepublic, we may well believe that sincere convictions no less than\r\nastute calculations moved him to do and dare all things for the sake\r\nof the new democratic commonwealth.[17]\r\n\r\nFor the present, however, a family duty urges him to return to\r\nCorsica. He obtains permission to escort home his sister Elise, and\r\nfor the third time we find him on furlough in Corsica. This laxity of\r\nmilitary discipline at such a crisis is explicable only on the\r\nsupposition that the revolutionary chiefs knew of his devotion to\r\ntheir cause and believed that his influence in the island would render\r\nhis informal services there more valuable than his regimental duties\r\nin the army then invading Savoy. For the word Republic, which fired\r\nhis imagination, was an offence to Paoli and to most of the\r\nislanders; and the phrase \"Republic one and indivisible,\" ever on the\r\nlips of the French, seemed to promise that the island must become a\r\npetty replica of France--France that was now dominated by the authors\r\nof the vile September massacres. The French party in the island was\r\ntherefore rapidly declining, and Paoli was preparing to sever the\r\nunion with France. For this he has been bitterly assailed as a\r\ntraitor. But, from Paoli's point of view, the acquisition of the\r\nisland by France was a piece of rank treachery; and his allegiance to\r\nFrance was technically at an end when the king was forcibly dethroned\r\nand the Republic was proclaimed. The use of the appellation \"traitor\"\r\nin such a case is merely a piece of childish abuse. It can be\r\njustified neither by reference to law, equity, nor to the popular\r\nsentiment of the time. Facts were soon to show that the islanders were\r\nbitterly opposed to the party then dominant in France. This hostility\r\nof a clannish, religious, and conservative populace against the\r\nbloodthirsty and atheistical innovators who then lorded it over France\r\nwas not diminished by the action of some six thousand French\r\nvolunteers, the off-scourings of the southern ports, who were landed\r\nat Ajaccio for an expedition against Sardinia. In their zeal for\r\nLiberty, Equality, and Fraternity, these _bonnets rouges_ came to\r\nblows with the men of Ajaccio, three of whom they hanged. So fierce\r\nwas the resentment caused by this outrage that the plan of a joint\r\nexpedition for the liberation of Sardinia from monarchical tyranny had\r\nto be modified; and Buonaparte, who was again in command of a\r\nbattalion of Corsican guards, proposed that the islanders alone should\r\nproceed to attack the Madalena Isles.\r\n\r\nThese islands, situated between Corsica and Sardinia, have a double\r\ninterest to the historical student. One of them, Caprera, was destined\r\nto shelter another Italian hero at the close of his career, the noble\r\nself-denying Garibaldi: the chief island of the group was the\r\nobjective of Buonaparte's first essay in regular warfare. After some\r\ndelays the little force set sail under the command of Cesari-Colonna,\r\nthe nephew of Paoli. According to Buonaparte's own official statement\r\nat the close of the affair, he had successfully landed his men near\r\nthe town to be assailed, and had thrown the Sardinian defences into\r\nconfusion, when a treacherous order from his chief bade him to cease\r\nfiring and return to the vessels. It has also been stated that this\r\nretreat was the outcome of a secret understanding between Paoli and\r\nCesari-Colonna that the expedition should miscarry. This seems highly\r\nprobable. A mutiny on board the chief ship of the flotilla was\r\nassigned by Cesari-Colonna as the cause of his order for a retreat;\r\nbut there are mutinies and mutinies, and this one may have been a\r\ntrick of the Paolists for thwarting Buonaparte's plan and leaving him\r\na prisoner. In any case, the young officer only saved himself and his\r\nmen by a hasty retreat to the boats, tumbling into the sea a mortar\r\nand four cannon. Such was the ending to the great captain's first\r\nmilitary enterprise.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Ajaccio (March 3rd, 1793), Buonaparte found affairs\r\nin utter confusion. News had recently arrived of the declaration of\r\nwar by the French Republic against England and Holland. Moreover,\r\nNapoleon's young brother, Lucien, had secretly denounced Paoli to the\r\nFrench authorities at Toulon; and three commissioners were now sent\r\nfrom Paris charged with orders to disband the Corsican National\r\nGuards, and to place the Corsican dictator under the orders of the\r\nFrench general commanding the army of Italy.[18]\r\n\r\nA game of truly Macchiavellian skill is now played. The French\r\ncommissioners, among whom the Corsican deputy, Salicetti, is by far\r\nthe most able, invite Paoli to repair to Toulon, there to concert\r\nmeasures for the defence of Corsica. Paoli, seeing through the ruse\r\nand discerning a guillotine, pleads that his age makes the journey\r\nimpossible; but with his friends he quietly prepares for resistance\r\nand holds the citadel of Ajaccio. Meanwhile the commissioners make\r\nfriendly overtures to the old chief; in these Napoleon participates,\r\nbeing ignorant of Lucien's action at Toulon. The sincerity of these\r\novertures may well be called in question, though Buonaparte still used\r\nthe language of affection to his former idol. However this may be, all\r\nhope of compromise is dashed by the zealots who are in power at Paris.\r\nOn April 2nd they order the French commissioners to secure Paoli's\r\nperson, by whatever means, and bring him to the French capital. At\r\nonce a cry of indignation goes up from all parts of Corsica; and\r\nBuonaparte draws up a declaration, vindicating Paoli's conduct and\r\nbegging the French Convention to revoke its decree.[19] Again, one\r\ncannot but suspect that this declaration was intended mainly, if not\r\nsolely, for local consumption. In any case, it failed to cool the\r\nresentment of the populace; and the partisans of France soon came to\r\nblows with the Paolists.\r\n\r\nSalicetti and Buonaparte now plan by various artifices to gain the\r\ncitadel of Ajaccio from the Paolists, but guile is three times foiled\r\nby guile equally astute. Failing here, the young captain seeks to\r\ncommunicate with the French commissioners at Bastia. He sets out\r\nsecretly, with a trusty shepherd as companion, to cross the island:\r\nbut at the village of Bocognano he is recognized and imprisoned by the\r\npartisans of Paoli. Some of the villagers, however, retain their old\r\naffection to the Buonaparte family, which here has an ancestral\r\nestate, and secretly set him free. He returns to Ajaccio, only to find\r\nan order for his arrest issued by the Corsican patriots. This time he\r\nescapes by timely concealment in the grotto of a friend's garden; and\r\nfrom the grounds of another family connection he finally glides away\r\nin a vessel to a point of safety, whence he reaches Bastia.\r\n\r\nStill, though a fugitive, he persists in believing that Ajaccio is\r\nFrench at heart, and urges the sending of a liberating force. The\r\nFrench commissioners agree, and the expedition sails--only to meet\r\nwith utter failure. Ajaccio, as one man, repels the partisans of\r\nFrance; and, a gale of wind springing up, Buonaparte and his men\r\nregain their boats with the utmost difficulty. At a place hard by, he\r\nfinds his mother, uncle, brothers and sisters. Madame Buonaparte, with\r\nthe extraordinary tenacity of will that characterized her famous son,\r\nhad wished to defend her house at Ajaccio against the hostile\r\npopulace; but, yielding to the urgent warnings of friends, finally\r\nfled to the nearest place of safety, and left the house to the fury of\r\nthe populace, by whom it was nearly wrecked.\r\n\r\nFor a brief space Buonaparte clung to the hope of regaining Corsica\r\nfor the Republic, but now only by the aid of French troops. For the\r\nislanders, stung by the demand of the French Convention that Paoli\r\nshould go to Paris, had rallied to the dictator's side; and the aged\r\nchief made overtures to England for alliance. The partisans of France,\r\nnow menaced by England's naval power, were in an utterly untenable\r\nposition. Even the steel-like will of Buonaparte was bent. His career\r\nin Corsica was at an end for the present; and with his kith and kin he\r\nset sail for France.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the events above described lies, not in their\r\nintrinsic importance, but in the signal proof which they afford of\r\nBuonaparte's wondrous endowments of mind and will. In a losing cause\r\nand in a petty sphere he displays all the qualities which, when the\r\nomens were favourable, impelled him to the domination of a Continent.\r\nHe fights every inch of ground tenaciously; at each emergency he\r\nevinces a truly Italian fertility of resource, gliding round obstacles\r\nor striving to shatter them by sheer audacity, seeing through men,\r\ncajoling them by his insinuations or overawing them by his mental\r\nsuperiority, ever determined to try the fickle jade Fortune to the\r\nvery utmost, and retreating only before the inevitable. The sole\r\nweakness discoverable in this nature, otherwise compact of strength,\r\nis an excess of will-power over all the faculties that make for\r\nprudence. His vivid imagination only serves to fire him with the full\r\nassurance that he must prevail over all obstacles.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, if he had now stopped to weigh well the lessons of the past,\r\nhitherto fertile only in failures and contradictions, he must have\r\nseen the powerlessness of his own will when in conflict with the\r\nforces of the age; for he had now severed his connection with the\r\nCorsican patriots, of whose cause he had only two years before been\r\nthe most passionate champion. It is evident that the schism which\r\nfinally separated Buonaparte and Paoli originated in their divergence\r\nof views regarding the French Revolution. Paoli accepted revolutionary\r\nprinciples only in so far as they promised to base freedom on a due\r\nbalance of class interests. He was a follower of Montesquieu. He\r\nlonged to see in Corsica a constitution similar to that of England or\r\nto that of 1791 in France. That hope vanished alike for France and\r\nCorsica after the fall of the monarchy; and towards the Jacobinical\r\nRepublic, which banished orthodox priests and guillotined the amiable\r\nLouis, Paoli thenceforth felt naught but loathing: \"We have been the\r\nenemies of kings,\" he said to Joseph Buonaparte; \"let us never be\r\ntheir executioners.\" Thenceforth he drifted inevitably into alliance\r\nwith England.\r\n\r\nBuonaparte, on the other hand, was a follower of Rousseau, whose ideas\r\nleaped to power at the downfall of the monarchy. Despite the excesses\r\nwhich he ever deplored, this second Revolution appeared to him to be\r\nthe dawn of a new and intelligent age. The clear-cut definitions of\r\nthe new political creed dovetailed in with his own rigid views of\r\nlife. Mankind was to be saved by law, society being levelled down and\r\nlevelled up until the ideals of Lycurgus were attained. Consequently\r\nhe regarded the Republic as a mighty agency for the social\r\nregeneration not only of France, but of all peoples. His insular\r\nsentiments were gradually merged in these vaster schemes.\r\nSelf-interest and the differentiating effects of party strifes\r\nundoubtedly assisted the mental transformation; but it is clear that\r\nthe study of the \"Social Contract\" was the touchstone of his early\r\nintellectual growth. He had gone to Rousseau's work to deepen his\r\nCorsican patriotism: he there imbibed doctrines which drew him\r\nirresistibly into the vortex of the French Revolution, and of its wars\r\nof propaganda and conquest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTOULON\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Buonaparte left Corsica for the coast of Provence, his career had\r\nbeen remarkable only for the strange contrast between the brilliance\r\nof his gifts and the utter failure of all his enterprises. His French\r\npartisanship had, as it seemed, been the ruin of his own and his\r\nfamily's fortunes. At the age of twenty-four he was known only as the\r\nunlucky leader of forlorn hopes and an outcast from the island around\r\nwhich his fondest longings had been entwined. His land-fall on the\r\nFrench coast seemed no more promising; for at that time Provence was\r\non the verge of revolt against the revolutionary Government. Even\r\ntowns like Marseilles and Toulon, which a year earlier had been noted\r\nfor their republican fervour, were now disgusted with the course of\r\nevents at Paris. In the third climax of revolutionary fury, that of\r\nJune 2nd, 1793, the more enlightened of the two republican factions,\r\nthe Girondins, had been overthrown by their opponents, the men of the\r\nMountain, who, aided by the Parisian rabble, seized on power. Most of\r\nthe Departments of France resented this violence and took up arms. But\r\nthe men of the Mountain acted with extraordinary energy: they\r\nproclaimed the Girondins to be in league with the invaders, and\r\nblasted their opponents with the charge of conspiring to divide France\r\ninto federal republics. The Committee of Public Safety, now installed\r\nin power at Paris, decreed a _levée en masse_ of able-bodied patriots\r\nto defend the sacred soil of the Republic, and the \"organizer of\r\nvictory,\" Carnot, soon drilled into a terrible efficiency the hosts\r\nthat sprang from the soil. On their side the Girondins had no\r\norganization whatever, and were embarrassed by the adhesion of very\r\nmany royalists. Consequently their wavering groups speedily gave way\r\nbefore the impact of the new, solid, central power.\r\n\r\nA movement so wanting in definiteness as that of the Girondins was\r\ndestined to slide into absolute opposition to the men of the Mountain:\r\nit was doomed to become royalist. Certainly it did not command the\r\nadhesion of Napoleon. His inclinations are seen in his pamphlet, \"Le\r\nSouper de Beaucaire,\" which he published in August, 1793. He wrote it\r\nin the intervals of some regimental work which had come to hand: and\r\nhis passage through the little town of Beaucaire seems to have\r\nsuggested the scenic setting of this little dialogue. It purports to\r\nrecord a discussion between an officer--Buonaparte himself--two\r\nmerchants of Marseilles, and citizens of Nîmes and Montpellier. It\r\nurges the need of united action under the lead of the Jacobins. The\r\nofficer reminds the Marseillais of the great services which their city\r\nhas rendered to the cause of liberty. Let Marseilles never disgrace\r\nherself by calling in the Spanish fleet as a protection against\r\nFrenchmen. Let her remember that this civil strife was part of a fight\r\nto the death between French patriots and the despots of Europe. That\r\nwas, indeed, the practical point at issue; the stern logic of facts\r\nranged on the Jacobin side all clear-sighted men who were determined\r\nthat the Revolution should not be stamped out by the foreign invaders.\r\nOn the ground of mere expediency, men must rally to the cause of the\r\nJacobinical Republic. Every crime might be condoned, provided that the\r\nmen now in power at Paris saved the country. Better their tyranny than\r\nthe vengeance of the emigrant _noblesse_. Such was the instinct of\r\nmost Frenchmen, and it saved France.\r\n\r\nAs an _exposé_ of keen policy and all-dominating opportunism, \"Le\r\nSouper de Beaucaire\" is admirable. In a national crisis anything that\r\nsaves the State is justifiable--that is its argument. The men of the\r\nMountain are abler and stronger than the Girondins: therefore the\r\nMarseillais are foolish not to bow to the men of the Mountain. The\r\nauthor feels no sympathy with the generous young Girondins, who, under\r\nthe inspiration of Madame Roland, sought to establish a republic of\r\nthe virtues even while they converted monarchical Europe by the sword.\r\nFew men can now peruse with undimmed eyes the tragic story of their\r\nfall. But the scenes of 1793 had transformed the Corsican youth into a\r\ndry-eyed opportunist who rejects the Girondins as he would have thrown\r\naside a defective tool: nay, he blames them as \"guilty of the greatest\r\nof crimes.\"[20]\r\n\r\nNevertheless Buonaparte was alive to the miseries of the situation. He\r\nwas weary of civil strifes, in which it seemed that no glory could be\r\nwon. He must hew his way to fortune, if only in order to support his\r\nfamily, which was now drifting about from village to village of\r\nProvence and subsisting on the slender sums doled out by the Republic\r\nto Corsican exiles.\r\n\r\nHe therefore applied, though without success, for a regimental\r\nexchange to the army of the Rhine. But while toiling through his\r\nadministrative drudgery in Provence, his duties brought him near to\r\nToulon, where the Republic was face to face with triumphant royalism.\r\nThe hour had struck: the man now appeared.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1793, Toulon joined other towns of the south in declaring\r\nagainst Jacobin tyranny; and the royalists of the town, despairing of\r\nmaking headway against the troops of the Convention, admitted English\r\nand Spanish squadrons to the harbour to hold the town for Louis XVII,\r\n(August 28th). This event shot an electric thrill through France. It\r\nwas the climax of a long series of disasters. Lyons had hoisted the\r\nwhite flag of the Bourbons, and was making a desperate defence against\r\nthe forces of the Convention: the royalist peasants of La Vendée had\r\nseveral times scattered the National Guards in utter rout: the\r\nSpaniards were crossing the Eastern Pyrenees: the Piedmontese were\r\nbefore the gates of Grenoble; and in the north and on the Rhine a\r\ndoubtful contest was raging.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of France when Buonaparte drew near to the\r\nrepublican forces encamped near Ollioules, to the north-west of\r\nToulon. He found them in disorder: their commander, Carteaux, had left\r\nthe easel to learn the art of war, and was ignorant of the range of\r\nhis few cannon; Dommartin, their artillery commander, had been\r\ndisabled by a wound; and the Commissioners of the Convention, who were\r\ncharged to put new vigour into the operations, were at their wits' end\r\nfor lack of men and munitions. One of them was Salicetti, who hailed\r\nhis coming as a godsend, and urged him to take Dommartin's place.\r\nThus, on September 16th, the thin, sallow, threadbare figure took\r\ncommand of the artillery.\r\n\r\nThe republicans menaced the town on two sides. Carteaux with some\r\n8,000 men held the hills between Toulon and Ollioules, while a corps\r\n3,000 strong, under Lapoype, observed the fortress on the side of La\r\nValette. Badly led though they were, they wrested the valley north of\r\nMount Faron from the allied outposts, and nearly completed the\r\nbesiegers' lines (September 18th). In fact, the garrison, which\r\ncomprised only 2,000 British troops, 4,000 Spaniards, 1,500 French\r\nroyalists, together with some Neapolitans and Piedmontese, was\r\ninsufficient to defend the many positions around the city on which its\r\nsafety depended. Indeed, General Grey wrote to Pitt that 50,000 men\r\nwere needed to garrison the place; but, as that was double the\r\nstrength of the British regular army then, the English Minister could\r\nonly hold out hopes of the arrival of an Austrian corps and a few\r\nhundred British.[21]\r\n\r\nBefore Buonaparte's arrival the Jacobins had no artillery: true, they\r\nhad a few field-pieces, four heavier guns and two mortars, which a\r\nsergeant helplessly surveyed; but they had no munitions, no tools,\r\nabove all no method and no discipline. Here then was the opportunity\r\nfor which he had been pining. At once he assumes the tone of a master.\r\n\"You mind your business, and let me look after mine,\" he exclaims to\r\nofficious infantrymen; \"it is artillery that takes fortresses:\r\ninfantry gives its help.\" The drudgery of the last weeks now yields\r\nfruitful results: his methodical mind, brooding over the chaos before\r\nhim, flashes back to this or that detail in some coast fort or\r\nmagazine: his energy hustles on the leisurely Provençaux, and in a few\r\ndays he has a respectable park of artillery--fourteen cannon, four\r\nmortars, and the necessary stores. In a brief space the Commissioners\r\nshow their approval of his services by promoting him to the rank of\r\n_chef de bataillon_.\r\n\r\nBy this time the tide was beginning to turn in favour of the Republic.\r\nOn October 9th Lyons fell before the Jacobins. The news lends a new\r\nzest to the Jacobins, whose left wing had (October 1st) been severely\r\nhandled by the allies on Mount Faron. Above all, Buonaparte's\r\nartillery can be still further strengthened. \"I have despatched,\" he\r\nwrote to the Minister of War, \"an intelligent officer to Lyons,\r\nBriançon, and Grenoble, to procure what might be useful to us. I have\r\nrequested the Army of Italy to furnish us with the cannon now useless\r\nfor the defence of Antibes and Monaco.... I have established at\r\nOllioules an arsenal with 80 workers. I have requisitioned horses from\r\nNice right to Valence and Montpellier.... I am having 5,000 gabions\r\nmade every day at Marseilles.\" But he was more than a mere organizer.\r\nHe was ever with his men, animating them by his own ardour: \"I always\r\nfound him at his post,\" wrote Doppet, who now succeeded Carteaux;\r\n\"when he needed rest he lay on the ground wrapped in his cloak: he\r\nnever left the batteries.\" There, amidst the autumn rains, he\r\ncontracted the febrile symptoms which for several years deepened the\r\npallor of his cheeks and furrowed the rings under his eyes, giving him\r\nthat uncanny, almost spectral, look which struck a chill to all who\r\nsaw him first and knew not the fiery energy that burnt within. There,\r\ntoo, his zeal, his unfailing resource, his bulldog bravery, and that\r\nindefinable quality which separates genius from talent speedily\r\nconquered the hearts of the French soldiery. One example of this\r\nmagnetic power must here suffice. He had ordered a battery to be made\r\nso near to Fort Mulgrave that Salicetti described it as within a\r\npistol-shot of the English guns. Could it be worked, its effect would\r\nbe decisive. But who could work it? The first day saw all its gunners\r\nkilled or wounded, and even the reckless Jacobins flinched from facing\r\nthe iron hail. \"Call it _the battery of the fearless_,\" ordered the\r\nyoung captain. The generous French nature was touched at its tenderest\r\npoint, personal and national honour, and the battery thereafter never\r\nlacked its full complement of gunners, living and dead.\r\n\r\nThe position at Fort Mulgrave, or the Little Gibraltar, was, indeed,\r\nall important; for if the republicans seized that commanding position,\r\nthe allied squadrons could be overpowered, or at least compelled to\r\nsail away; and with their departure Toulon must fall.\r\n\r\nHere we come on to ground that has been fiercely fought over in wordy\r\nwar. Did Bonaparte originate the plan of attack? Or did he throw his\r\nweight and influence into a scheme that others beside him had\r\ndesigned? Or did he merely carry out orders as a subordinate?\r\nAccording to the Commissioner Barras, the last was the case. But\r\nBarras was with the eastern wing of the besiegers, that is, some miles\r\naway from the side of La Seyne and L'Eguillette, where Buonaparte\r\nfought. Besides, Barras' \"Mémoires\" are so untruthful where Buonaparte\r\nis concerned, as to be unworthy of serious attention, at least on\r\nthese points.[22] The historian M. Jung likewise relegates Buonaparte\r\nto a quite subordinate position.[23] But his narrative omits some of\r\nthe official documents which show that Buonaparte played a very\r\nimportant part in the siege. Other writers claim that Buonaparte's\r\ninfluence on the whole conduct of operations was paramount and\r\ndecisive. Thus, M. Duruy quotes the letter of the Commissioners to the\r\nConvention: \"We shall take care not to lay siege to Toulon by ordinary\r\nmeans, when we have a surer means to reduce it, that is, by burning\r\nthe enemy's fleet.... We are only waiting for the siege-guns before\r\ntaking up a position whence we may reach the ships with red-hot balls;\r\nand we shall see if we are not masters of Toulon.\" But this very\r\nletter disproves the Buonapartist claim. It was written on September\r\n13th. Thus, _three days before Buonaparte's arrival_, the\r\nCommissioners had fully decided on attacking the Little Gibraltar; and\r\nthe claim that Buonaparte originated the plan can only be sustained by\r\nantedating his arrival at Toulon.[24] In fact, every experienced\r\nofficer among besiegers and besieged saw the weak point of the\r\ndefence: early in September Hood and Mulgrave began the fortification\r\nof the heights behind L'Eguillette. In face of these facts, the\r\nassertion that Buonaparte was the first to design the movements which\r\nsecured the surrender of Toulon must be relegated to the domain of\r\nhero-worship.

Yet for him Buonaparte had scarcely more respect.\r\nOn November 15th an affair of outposts near Fort Mulgrave showed his\r\nweakness. The soldiers on both sides eagerly took up the affray; line\r\nafter line of the French rushed up towards that frowning redoubt:\r\nO'Hara, the leader of the allied troops, encouraged the British in a\r\nsortie that drove back the blue-coats; whereupon Buonaparte headed the\r\nrallying rush to the gorge of the redoubt, when Doppet sounded the\r\nretreat. Half blinded by rage and by the blood trickling from a slight\r\nwound in his forehead, the young Corsican rushed back to Doppet and\r\nabused him in the language of the camp: \"Our blow at Toulon has\r\nmissed, because a---- has beaten the retreat.\" The soldiery applauded\r\nthis revolutionary licence, and bespattered their chief with similar\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nA few days later the tall soldierly Dugommier took the command:\r\nreinforcements began to pour in, finally raising the strength of the\r\nbesiegers to 37,000 men. Above all, the new commander gave Buonaparte\r\n_carte blanche_ for the direction of the artillery. New batteries\r\naccordingly began to ring the Little Gibraltar on the landward side;\r\nO'Hara, while gallantly heading a sortie, fell into the republicans'\r\nhands, and the defenders began to lose heart. The worst disappointment\r\nwas the refusal of the Austrian Court to fulfil its promise, solemnly\r\ngiven in September, to send 5,000 regular troops for the defence of\r\nToulon.\r\n\r\nThe final conflict took place on the night of December 16-17, when\r\ntorrents of rain, a raging wind, and flashes of lightning added new\r\nhorrors to the strife. Scarcely had the assailants left the sheltering\r\nwalls of La Seyne, than Buonaparte's horse fell under him, shot dead:\r\nwhole companies went astray in the darkness: yet the first column of\r\n2,000 men led by Victor rush at the palisades of Fort Mulgrave, tear\r\nthem down, and sweep into the redoubt, only to fall in heaps before a\r\nsecond line of defence: supported by the second column, they rally,\r\nonly to yield once more before the murderous fire. In despair,\r\nDugommier hurries on the column of reserve, with which Buonaparte\r\nawaits the crisis of the night. Led by the gallant young Muiron, the\r\nreserve sweeps into the gorge of death; Muiron, Buonaparte, and\r\nDugommier hack their way through the same embrasure: their men swarm\r\nin on the overmatched red-coats and Spaniards, cut them down at their\r\nguns, and the redoubt is won.\r\n\r\nThis event was decisive. The Neapolitans, who were charged to hold the\r\nneighbouring forts, flung themselves into the sea; and the ships\r\nthemselves began to weigh anchor; for Buonaparte's guns soon poured\r\ntheir shot on the fleet and into the city itself. But even in that\r\ndesperate strait the allies turned fiercely to bay. On the evening of\r\nDecember 17th a young officer, who was destined once more to thwart\r\nBuonaparte's designs, led a small body of picked men into the dockyard\r\nto snatch from the rescuing clutch of the Jacobins the French warships\r\nthat could not be carried off. Then was seen a weird sight. The galley\r\nslaves, now freed from their chains and clustering in angry groups,\r\nmenaced the intruders. Yet the British seamen spread the combustibles\r\nand let loose the demon of destruction. Forthwith the flames shot up\r\nthe masts, and licked up the stores of hemp, tar, and timber: and the\r\nexplosion of two powder-ships by the Spaniards shook the earth for\r\nmany miles around. Napoleon ever retained a vivid mental picture of\r\nthe scene, which amid the hated calm of St. Helena he thus described:\r\n\"The whirlwind of flames and smoke from the arsenal resembled the\r\neruption of a volcano, and the thirteen vessels blazing in the roads\r\nwere like so many displays of fireworks: the masts and forms of the\r\nvessels were distinctly traced out by the flames, which lasted many\r\nhours and formed an unparalleled spectacle.\" [25] The sight struck\r\nhorror to the hearts of the royalists of Toulon, who saw in it the\r\nsignal of desertion by the allies; and through the lurid night crowds\r\nof panic-stricken wretches thronged the quays crying aloud to be taken\r\naway from the doomed city. The glare of the flames, the crash of the\r\nenemy's bombs, the explosion of the two powder-ships, frenzied many a\r\nsoul; and scores of those who could find no place in the boats flung\r\nthemselves into the sea rather than face the pikes and guillotines of\r\nthe Jacobins. Their fears were only too well founded; for a fortnight\r\nlater Fréron, the Commissioner of the Convention, boasted that two\r\nhundred royalists perished daily.\r\n\r\nIt remains briefly to consider a question of special interest to\r\nEnglish readers. Did the Pitt Ministry intend to betray the confidence\r\nof the French royalists and keep Toulon for England? The charge has\r\nbeen brought by certain French writers that the British, after\r\nentering Toulon with promise that they would hold it in pledge for\r\nLouis XVII., nevertheless lorded it over the other allies and revealed\r\ntheir intention of keeping that stronghold. These writers aver that\r\nHood, after entering Toulon as an equal with the Spanish admiral,\r\nLangara, laid claim to entire command of the land forces; that English\r\ncommissioners were sent for the administration of the town; and that\r\nthe English Government refused to allow the coming of the Comte de\r\nProvence, who, as the elder of the two surviving brothers of Louis\r\nXVI., was entitled to act on behalf of Louis XVII.[26] The facts in\r\nthe main are correct, but the interpretation put upon them may well be\r\nquestioned. Hood certainly acted with much arrogance towards the\r\nSpaniards. But when the more courteous O'Hara arrived to take command\r\nof the British, Neapolitan, and Sardinian troop, the new commander\r\nagreed to lay aside the question of supreme command. It was not till\r\nNovember 30th that the British Government sent off any despatch on the\r\nquestion, which meanwhile had been settled at Toulon by the exercise\r\nof that tact in which Hood seems signally to have been lacking. The\r\nwhole question was personal, not national.\r\n\r\nStill less was the conduct of the British Government towards the Comte\r\nde Provence a proof of its design to keep Toulon. The records of our\r\nForeign Office show that, before the occupation of that stronghold for\r\nLouis XVII., we had declined to acknowledge the claims of his uncle to\r\nthe Regency. He and his brother, the Comte d'Artois, were notoriously\r\nunpopular in France, except with royalists of the old school; and\r\ntheir presence at Toulon would certainly have raised awkward questions\r\nabout the future government. The conduct of Spain had hitherto been\r\nsimilar.[27] But after the occupation of Toulon, the Court of Madrid\r\njudged the presence of the Comte de Provence in that fortress to be\r\nadvisable; whereas the Pitt Ministry adhered to its former belief,\r\ninsisted on the difficulty of conducting the defence if the Prince\r\nwere present as Regent, instructed Mr. Drake, our Minister at Genoa,\r\nto use every argument to deter him from proceeding to Toulon, and\r\nprivately ordered our officers there, in the last resort, to refuse\r\nhim permission to land. The instructions of October 18th to the royal\r\ncommissioners at Toulon show that George III. and his Ministers\r\nbelieved they would be compromising the royalist cause by recognizing\r\na regency; and certainly any effort by the allies to prejudice the\r\nfuture settlement would at once have shattered any hopes of a general\r\nrally to the royalist side.[28]\r\n\r\nBesides, if England meant to keep Toulon, why did she send only 2,200\r\nsoldiers? Why did she admit, not only 6,900 Spaniards, but also 4,900\r\nNeapolitans and 1,600 Piedmontese? Why did she accept the armed help\r\nof 1,600 French royalists? Why did she urgently plead with Austria to\r\nsend 5,000 white-coats from Milan? Why, finally, is there no word in\r\nthe British official despatches as to the eventual keeping of Toulon;\r\nwhile there are several references to _indemnities_ which George III.\r\nwould require for the expenses of the war--such as Corsica or some of\r\nthe French West Indies? Those despatches show conclusively that\r\nEngland did not wish to keep a fortress that required a permanent\r\ngarrison equal to half of the British army on its peace footing; but\r\nthat she did regard it as a good base of operations for the overthrow\r\nof the Jacobin rule and the restoration of monarchy; whereupon her\r\nservices must be requited with some suitable indemnity, either one of\r\nthe French West Indies or Corsica. These plans were shattered by\r\nBuonaparte's skill and the valour of Dugommier's soldiery; but no\r\nrecord has yet leaped to light to convict the Pitt Ministry of the\r\nperfidy which Buonaparte, in common with nearly all Frenchmen, charged\r\nto their account.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nVENDÉMIAIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next period of Buonaparte's life presents few features of\r\ninterest. He was called upon to supervise the guns and stores for the\r\nArmy of Italy, and also to inspect the fortifications and artillery of\r\nthe coast. At Marseilles his zeal outstripped his discretion. He\r\nordered the reconstruction of the fortress which had been destroyed\r\nduring the Revolution; but when the townsfolk heard the news, they\r\nprotested so vehemently that the work was stopped and an order was\r\nissued for Buonaparte's arrest. From this difficulty the friendship of\r\nthe younger Robespierre and of Salicetti, the Commissioners of the\r\nConvention, availed to rescue him; but the incident proves that his\r\nservices at Toulon were not so brilliant as to have raised him above\r\nthe general level of meritorious officers, who were applauded while\r\nthey prospered, but might be sent to the guillotine for any serious\r\noffence.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1794, he was appointed at Nice general in command of the\r\nartillery of the Army of Italy, which drove the Sardinian troops from\r\nseveral positions between Ventimiglia and Oneglia. Thence, swinging\r\nround by passes of the Maritime Alps, they outflanked the positions of\r\nthe Austro-Sardinian forces at the Col di Tenda, which had defied all\r\nattack in front. Buonaparte's share in this turning operation seems to\r\nhave been restricted to the effective handling of artillery, and the\r\nchief credit here rested with Masséna, who won the first of his\r\nlaurels in the country of his birth. He was of humble parentage;\r\nyet his erect bearing, proud animated glance, curt penetrating speech,\r\nand keen repartees, proclaimed a nature at once active and wary, an\r\nintellect both calculating and confident. Such was the man who was to\r\nimmortalize his name in many a contest, until his glory paled before\r\nthe greater genius of Wellington.\r\n\r\nMuch of the credit of organizing this previously unsuccessful army\r\nbelongs to the younger Robespierre, who, as Commissioner of the\r\nConvention, infused his energy into all departments of the service.\r\nFor some months his relations to Buonaparte were those of intimacy;\r\nbut whether they extended to complete sympathy on political matters\r\nmay be doubted. The younger Robespierre held the revolutionary creed\r\nwith sufficient ardour, though one of his letters dated from Oneglia\r\nsuggests that the fame of the Terror was hurtful to the prospects of\r\nthe campaign. It states that the whole of the neighbouring inhabitants\r\nhad fled before the French soldiers, in the belief that they were\r\ndestroyers of religion and eaters of babies: this was inconvenient, as\r\nit prevented the supply of provisions and the success of forced loans.\r\nThe letter suggests that he was a man of action rather than of ideas,\r\nand probably it was this practical quality which bound Buonaparte in\r\nfriendship to him. Yet it is difficult to fathom Buonaparte's ideas\r\nabout the revolutionary despotism which was then deluging Paris with\r\nblood. Outwardly he appeared to sympathize with it. Such at least is\r\nthe testimony of Marie Robespierre, with whom Buonaparte's sisters\r\nwere then intimate. \"Buonaparte,\" she said, \"was a republican: I will\r\neven say that he took the side of the Mountain: at least, that was the\r\nimpression left on my mind by his opinions when I was at Nice.... His\r\nadmiration for my elder brother, his friendship for my younger\r\nbrother, and perhaps also the interest inspired by my misfortunes,\r\ngained for me, under the Consulate, a pension of 3,600 francs.\"[29]\r\nEqually noteworthy is the later declaration of Napoleon that\r\nRobespierre was the \"scapegoat of the Revolution.\" [30] It appears\r\nprobable, then, that he shared the Jacobinical belief that the Terror\r\nwas a necessary though painful stage in the purification of the body\r\npolitic. His admiration of the rigour of Lycurgus, and his dislike of\r\nall superfluous luxury, alike favour this supposition; and as he\r\nalways had the courage of his convictions, it is impossible to\r\nconceive him clinging to the skirts of the terrorists merely from a\r\nmean hope of prospective favours. That is the alternative explanation\r\nof his intimacy with young Robespierre. Some of his injudicious\r\nadmirers, in trying to disprove his complicity with the terrorists,\r\nimpale themselves on this horn of the dilemma. In seeking to clear\r\nhim from the charge of Terrorism, they stain him with the charge of\r\ntruckling to the terrorists. They degrade him from the level of St.\r\nJust to that of Barrère.\r\n\r\nA sentence in one of young Robespierre's letters shows that he never\r\nfelt completely sure about the young officer. After enumerating to his\r\nbrother Buonaparte's merits, he adds: \"He is a Corsican, and offers\r\nonly the guarantee of a man of that nation who has resisted the\r\ncaresses of Paoli and whose property has been ravaged by that\r\ntraitor.\" Evidently, then, Robespierre regarded Buonaparte with some\r\nsuspicion as an insular Proteus, lacking those sureties, mental and\r\npecuniary, which reduced a man to dog-like fidelity.\r\n\r\nYet, however warily Buonaparte picked his steps along the slopes of\r\nthe revolutionary volcano, he was destined to feel the scorch of the\r\ncentral fires. He had recently been intrusted with a mission to the\r\nGenoese Republic, which was in a most difficult position. It was\r\nsubject to pressure from three sides; from English men-of-war that had\r\nswooped down on a French frigate, the \"Modeste,\" in Genoese waters;\r\nand from actual invasion by the French on the west and by the\r\nAustrians on the north. Despite the great difficulties of his task, the\r\nyoung envoy bent the distracted Doge and Senate to his will. He\r\nmight, therefore, have expected gratitude from his adopted country;\r\nbut shortly after he returned to Nice he was placed under arrest, and\r\nwas imprisoned in a fort near Antibes.\r\n\r\nThe causes of this swift reverse of fortune were curiously complex.\r\nThe Robespierres had in the meantime been guillotined at Paris (July\r\n28th, or Thermidor 10th); and this \"Thermidorian\" reaction alone would\r\nhave sufficed to endanger Buonaparte's head. But his position was\r\nfurther imperilled by his recent strategic suggestions, which had\r\nserved to reduce to a secondary _rôle_ the French Army of the Alps.\r\nThe operations of that force had of late been strangely thwarted; and\r\nits leaders, searching for the paralyzing influence, discovered it in\r\nthe advice of Buonaparte. Their suspicions against him were formulated\r\nin a secret letter to the Committee of Public Safety, which stated\r\nthat the Army of the Alps had been kept inactive by the intrigues of\r\nthe younger Robespierre and of Ricord. Many a head had fallen for\r\nreasons less serious than these. But Buonaparte had one infallible\r\nsafeguard: he could not well be spared. After a careful examination of\r\nhis papers, the Commissioners, Salicetti and Albitte, provisionally\r\nrestored him to liberty, but not, for some weeks, to his rank of\r\ngeneral (August 20th, 1794). The chief reason assigned for his\r\nliberation was the service which his knowledge and talents might\r\nrender to the Republic, a reference to the knowledge of the Italian\r\ncoast-line which he had gained during the mission to Genoa.\r\n\r\nFor a space his daring spirit was doomed to chafe in comparative\r\ninactivity, in supervising the coast artillery. But his faults were\r\nforgotten in the need which was soon felt for his warlike prowess. An\r\nexpedition was prepared to free Corsica from \"the tyranny of the\r\nEnglish\"; and in this Buonaparte sailed, as general commanding the\r\nartillery. With him were two friends, Junot and Marmont, who had clung\r\nto him through his recent troubles; the former was to be helped to\r\nwealth and fame by Buonaparte's friendship, the latter by his own\r\nbrilliant gifts.[31] In this expedition their talent was of no avail.\r\nThe French were worsted in an engagement with the British fleet, and\r\nfell back in confusion to the coast of France. Once again Buonaparte's\r\nCorsican enterprises were frustrated by the ubiquitous lords of the\r\nsea: against them he now stored up a double portion of hate, for in\r\nthe meantime his inspectorship of coast artillery had been given to\r\nhis fellow-countryman, Casabianca.\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of these Corsican exiles drifted hither and thither in\r\nmany perplexing currents, as Buonaparte was once more to discover. It\r\nwas a prevalent complaint that there were too many of them seeking\r\nemployment in the army of the south; and a note respecting the career\r\nof the young officer made by General Schérer, who now commanded the\r\nFrench Army of Italy, shows that Buonaparte had aroused at least as\r\nmuch suspicion as admiration. It runs: \"This officer is general of\r\nartillery, and in this arm has sound knowledge, but has somewhat too\r\nmuch ambition and intriguing habits for his advancement.\" All things\r\nconsidered, it was deemed advisable to transfer him to the army which\r\nwas engaged in crushing the Vendéan revolt, a service which he loathed\r\nand was determined, if possible, to evade. Accompanied by his faithful\r\nfriends, Marmont and Junot, as also by his young brother Louis, he set\r\nout for Paris (May, 1795).\r\n\r\nIn reality Fortune never favoured him more than when she removed him\r\nfrom the coteries of intriguing Corsicans on the coast of Provence and\r\nbrought him to the centre of all influence. An able schemer at Paris\r\ncould decide the fate of parties and governments. At the frontiers men\r\ncould only accept the decrees of the omnipotent capital. Moreover, the\r\nRevolution, after passing through the molten stage, was now beginning\r\nto solidify, an important opportunity for the political craftsman. The\r\nspring of the year 1795 witnessed a strange blending of the new\r\nfanaticism with the old customs. Society, dammed up for a time by the\r\nSpartan rigour of Robespierre, was now flowing back into its wonted\r\nchannels. Gay equipages were seen in the streets; theatres, prosperous\r\neven during the Terror, were now filled to overflowing; gambling,\r\nwhether in money or in stocks and _assignats_, was now permeating all\r\ngrades of society; and men who had grown rich by amassing the\r\nconfiscated State lands now vied with bankers, stock-jobbers, and\r\nforestallers of grain in vulgar ostentation. As for the poor, they\r\nwere meeting their match in the gilded youth of Paris, who with\r\nclubbed sticks asserted the right of the rich to be merry. If the\r\n_sansculottes_ attempted to restore the days of the Terror, the\r\nNational Guards of Paris were ready to sweep them back into the slums.\r\nSuch was their fate on May 20th, shortly after Buonaparte's arrival at\r\nParis. Any dreams which he may have harboured of restoring the\r\nJacobins to power were dissipated, for Paris now plunged into the\r\ngaieties of the _ancien régime_. The Terror was remembered only as a\r\nhorrible nightmare, which served to add zest to the pleasures of the\r\npresent. In some circles no one was received who had not lost a\r\nrelative by the guillotine. With a ghastly merriment characteristic of\r\nthe time, \"victim balls\" were given, to which those alone were\r\nadmitted who could produce the death warrant of some family\r\nconnection: these secured the pleasure of dancing in costumes which\r\nrecalled those of the scaffold, and of beckoning ever and anon to\r\ntheir partners with nods that simulated the fall of the severed head.\r\nIt was for this, then, that the amiable Louis, the majestic Marie\r\nAntoinette, the Minerva-like Madame Roland, the Girondins vowed to the\r\nutter quest of liberty, the tyrant-quelling Danton, the incorruptible\r\nRobespierre himself, had felt the fatal axe; in order that the mimicry\r\nof their death agonies might tickle jaded appetites, and help to weave\r\nanew the old Circean spells. So it seemed to the few who cared to\r\nthink of the frightful sacrifices of the past, and to measure them\r\nagainst the seemingly hopeless degradation of the present.\r\n\r\nSome such thoughts seem to have flitted across the mind of Buonaparte\r\nin those months of forced inactivity. It was a time of disillusionment.\r\nRarely do we find thenceforth in his correspondence any gleams of\r\nfaith respecting the higher possibilities of the human race. The\r\ngolden visions of youth now vanish along with the _bonnet rouge_ and\r\nthe jargon of the Terror. His bent had ever been for the material and\r\npractical: and now that faith in the Jacobinical creed was vanishing,\r\nit was more than ever desirable to grapple that errant balloon to\r\nsubstantial facts. Evidently, the Revolution must now trust to the\r\nclinging of the peasant proprietors to the recently confiscated lands\r\nof the Church and of the emigrant nobles. If all else was vain and\r\ntransitory, here surely was a solid basis of material interests to\r\nwhich the best part of the manhood of France would tenaciously adhere,\r\ndefying alike the plots of reactionaries and the forces of monarchical\r\nEurope. Of these interests Buonaparte was to be the determined\r\nguarantor. Amidst much that was visionary in his later policy he never\r\nwavered in his championship of the new peasant proprietors. He was\r\never the peasants' General, the peasants' Consul, the peasants'\r\nEmperor.\r\n\r\nThe transition of the Revolution to an ordinary form of polity was\r\nalso being furthered by its unparalleled series of military triumphs.\r\nWhen Buonaparte's name was as yet unknown, except in Corsica and\r\nProvence, France practically gained her \"natural boundaries,\" the\r\nRhine and the Alps. In the campaigns of 1793-4, the soldiers of\r\nPichegru, Kléber, Hoche, and Moreau overran the whole of the Low\r\nCountries and chased the Germans beyond the Rhine; the Piedmontese\r\nwere thrust behind the Alps; the Spaniards behind the Pyrenees. In\r\nquick succession State after State sued for peace: Tuscany in\r\nFebruary, 1795; Prussia in April; Hanover, Westphalia, and Saxony in\r\nMay; Spain and Hesse-Cassel in July; Switzerland and Denmark in\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of France when Buonaparte came to seek his\r\nfortunes in the Sphinx-like capital. His artillery command had been\r\ncommuted to a corresponding rank in the infantry--a step that deeply\r\nincensed him. He attributed it to malevolent intriguers; but all his\r\nefforts to obtain redress were in vain. Lacking money and patronage,\r\nknown only as an able officer and facile intriguer of the bankrupt\r\nJacobinical party, he might well have despaired. He was now almost\r\nalone. Marmont had gone off to the Army of the Rhine; but Junot was\r\nstill with him, allured perhaps by Madame Permon's daughter, whom he\r\nsubsequently married. At the house of this amiable hostess, an old\r\nfriend of his family, Buonaparte found occasional relief from the\r\ngloom of his existence. The future Madame Junot has described him as\r\nat this time untidy, unkempt, sickly, remarkable for his extreme\r\nthinness and the almost yellow tint of his visage, which was, however,\r\nlit up by \"two eyes sparkling with keenness and will-power\"--evidently\r\na Corsican falcon, pining for action, and fretting its soaring spirit\r\nin that vapid town life. Action Buonaparte might have had, but only of\r\na kind that he loathed. He might have commanded the troops destined to\r\ncrush the brave royalist peasants of La Vendée. But, whether from\r\nscorn of such vulture-work, or from an instinct that a nobler quarry\r\nmight be started at Paris, he refused to proceed to the Army of the\r\nWest, and on the plea of ill-health remained in the capital. There he\r\nspent his time deeply pondering on politics and strategy. He designed\r\na history of the last two years, and drafted a plan of campaign for\r\nthe Army of Italy, which, later on, was to bear him to fortune.\r\nProbably the geographical insight which it displayed may have led to\r\nhis appointment (August 20th, 1795) to the topographical bureau of the\r\nCommittee of Public Safety. His first thought on hearing of this\r\nimportant advancement was that it opened up an opportunity for\r\nproceeding to Turkey to organize the artillery of the Sultan; and in a\r\nfew days he sent in a formal request to that effect--the first\r\ntangible proof of that yearning after the Orient which haunted him all\r\nthrough life. But, while straining his gaze eastwards, he experienced\r\na sharp rebuff. The Committee was on the point of granting his\r\nrequest, when an examination of his recent conduct proved him guilty\r\nof a breach of discipline in not proceeding to his Vendéan command. On\r\nthe very day when one department of the Committee empowered him to\r\nproceed to Constantinople, the Central Committee erased his name from\r\nthe list of general officers (September 15th).\r\n\r\nThis time the blow seemed fatal. But Fortune appeared to compass his\r\nfalls only in order that he might the more brilliantly tower aloft.\r\nWithin three weeks he was hailed as the saviour of the new republican\r\nconstitution. The cause of this almost magical change in his prospects\r\nis to be sought in the political unrest of France, to which we must\r\nnow briefly advert.\r\n\r\nAll through this summer of 1795 there were conflicts between Jacobins\r\nand royalists. In the south the latter party had signally avenged\r\nitself for the agonies of the preceding years, and the ardour of the\r\nFrench temperament seemed about to drive that hapless people from the\r\n\"Red Terror\" to a veritable \"White Terror,\" when two disasters checked\r\nthe course of the reaction. An attempt of a large force of emigrant\r\nFrench nobles, backed up by British money and ships, to rouse Brittany\r\nagainst the Convention was utterly crushed by the able young Hoche;\r\nand nearly seven hundred prisoners were afterwards shot down in cold\r\nblood (July). Shortly before this blow, the little prince styled Louis\r\nXVII. succumbed to the brutal treatment of his gaolers at the Temple\r\nin Paris; and the hopes of the royalists now rested on the unpopular\r\nComte de Provence. Nevertheless, the political outlook in the summer\r\nof 1795 was not reassuring to the republicans; and the Commission of\r\nEleven, empowered by the Convention to draft new organic laws, drew up\r\nan instrument of government, which, though republican in form, seemed\r\nto offer all the stability of the most firmly rooted oligarchy. Some\r\nsuch compromise was perhaps necessary; for the Commonwealth was\r\nconfronted by three dangers, anarchy resulting from the pressure of\r\nthe mob, an excessive centralization of power in the hands of two\r\ncommittees, and the possibility of a _coup d'état_ by some pretender\r\nor adventurer. Indeed, the student of French history cannot fail to\r\nsee that this is the problem which is ever before the people of\r\nFrance. It has presented itself in acute though diverse phases in\r\n1797,1799,1814, 1830, 1848, 1851, and in 1871. Who can say that the\r\nproblem has yet found its complete solution?\r\n\r\nIn some respects the constitution which the Convention voted in\r\nAugust, 1795, was skilfully adapted to meet the needs of the time.\r\nThough democratic in spirit, it granted a vote only to those citizens\r\nwho had resided for a year in some dwelling and had paid taxes, thus\r\nexcluding the rabble who had proved to be dangerous to any settled\r\ngovernment. It also checked the hasty legislation which had brought\r\nridicule on successive National Assemblies. In order to moderate the\r\nzeal for the manufacture of decrees, which had often exceeded one\r\nhundred a month, a second or revising chamber was now to be formed on\r\nthe basis of age; for it had been found that the younger the deputies\r\nthe faster came forth the fluttering flocks of decrees, that often\r\ncame home to roost in the guise of curses. A senatorial guillotine, it\r\nwas now proposed, should thin out the fledglings before they flew\r\nabroad at all. Of the seven hundred and fifty deputies of France, the\r\ntwo hundred and fifty oldest men were to form the Council of Ancients,\r\nhaving powers to amend or reject the proposals emanating from the\r\nCouncil of Five Hundred. In this Council were the younger deputies,\r\nand with them rested the sole initiation of laws. Thus the young\r\ndeputies were to make the laws, but the older deputies were to amend\r\nor reject them; and this nice adjustment of the characteristics of\r\nyouth and age, a due blending of enthusiasm with caution, promised to\r\ninvigorate the body politic and yet guard its vital interests.\r\nLastly, in order that the two Councils should continuously represent\r\nthe feelings of France, one third of their members must retire for\r\nre-election every year, a device which promised to prevent any violent\r\nchange in their composition, such as might occur if, at the end of\r\ntheir three years' membership, all were called upon to resign at once.\r\n\r\nBut the real crux of constitution builders had hitherto been in the\r\nrelations of the Legislature to the Executive. How should the brain of\r\nthe body politic, that is, the Legislature, be connected with the\r\nhand, that is, the Executive? Obviously, so argued all French\r\npolitical thinkers, the two functions were distinct and must be kept\r\nseparate. The results of this theory of the separation of powers were\r\nclearly traceable in the course of the Revolution. When the hand had\r\nbeen left almost powerless, as in 1791-2, owing to democratic jealousy\r\nof the royal Ministry, the result had been anarchy. The supreme needs\r\nof the State in the agonies of 1793 had rendered the hand omnipotent:\r\nthe Convention, that is, the brain, was for some time powerless before\r\nits own instrument, the two secret committees. Experience now showed\r\nthat the brain must exercise a general control over the hand, without\r\nunduly hampering its actions. Evidently, then, the deputies of France\r\nmust intrust the details of administration to responsible Ministers,\r\nthough some directing agency seemed needed as a spur to energy and a\r\ncheck against royalist plots. In brief, the Committee of Public\r\nSafety, purged of its more dangerous powers, was to furnish the model\r\nfor a new body of five members, termed the Directory. This\r\norganism, which was to give its name to the whole period 1795-1799,\r\nwas not the Ministry. There was no Ministry as we now use the term.\r\nThere were Ministers who were responsible individually for their\r\ndepartments of State: but they never met for deliberation, or\r\ncommunicated with the Legislature; they were only heads of\r\ndepartments, who were responsible individually to the Directors. These\r\nfive men formed a powerful committee, deliberating in private on the\r\nwhole policy of the State and on all the work of the Ministers. The\r\nDirectory had not, it is true, the right of initiating laws and of\r\narbitrary arrest which the two committees had freely exercised during\r\nthe Terror. Its dependence on the Legislature seemed also to be\r\nguaranteed by the Directors being appointed by the two legislative\r\nCouncils; while one of the five was to vacate his office for\r\nre-election every year. But in other respects the directorial powers\r\nwere almost as extensive as those wielded by the two secret\r\ncommittees, or as those which Bonaparte was to inherit from the\r\nDirectory in 1799. They comprised the general control of policy in\r\npeace and war, the right to negotiate treaties (subject to\r\nratification by the legislative councils), to promulgate laws voted by\r\nthe Councils and watch over their execution, and to appoint or dismiss\r\nthe Ministers of State.\r\n\r\nSuch was the constitution which was proclaimed on September 22nd,\r\n1795, or 1st Vendémiaire, Year IV., of the revolutionary calendar. An\r\nimportant postscript to the original constitution now excited fierce\r\ncommotions which enabled the young officer to repair his own shattered\r\nfortunes. The Convention, terrified at the thought of a general\r\nelection, which might send up a malcontent or royalist majority,\r\ndecided to impose itself on France for at least two years longer. With\r\nan effrontery unparalleled in parliamentary annals, it decreed that\r\nthe law of the new constitution, requiring the re-election of\r\none-third of the deputies every year, should now be applied to itself;\r\nand that the rest of its members should sit in the forthcoming\r\nCouncils. At once a cry of disgust and rage arose from all who were\r\nweary of the Convention and all its works. \"Down with the\r\ntwo-thirds!\" was the cry that resounded through the streets of Paris.\r\nThe movement was not so much definitely royalist as vaguely\r\nmalcontent. The many were enraged by the existing dearth and by the\r\nfailure of the Revolution to secure even cheap bread. Doubtless the\r\nroyalists strove to drive on the discontent to the desired goal, and\r\nin many parts they tinged the movement with an unmistakably Bourbon\r\ntint. But it is fairly certain that in Paris they could not alone have\r\nfomented a discontent so general as that of Vendémiaire. That they\r\nwould have profited by the defeat of the Convention is, however,\r\nequally certain. The history of the Revolution proves that those who\r\nat first merely opposed the excesses of the Jacobins gradually drifted\r\nover to the royalists. The Convention now found itself attacked in the\r\nvery city which had been the chosen abode of Liberty and Equality.\r\nSome thirty thousand of the Parisian National Guards were determined\r\nto give short shrift to this Assembly that clung so indecently to\r\nlife; and as the armies were far away, the Parisian malcontents seemed\r\nmasters of the situation. Without doubt they would have been but for\r\ntheir own precipitation and the energy of Buonaparte.\r\n\r\nBut how came he to receive the military authority which was so\r\npotently to influence the course of events? We left him in Fructidor\r\ndisgraced: we find him in the middle of Vendémiaire leading part of\r\nthe forces of the Convention. This bewildering change was due to the\r\npressing needs of the Republic, to his own signal abilities, and to\r\nthe discerning eye of Barras, whose career claims a brief notice.\r\n\r\nPaul Barras came of a Provençal family, and had an adventurous life\r\nboth on land and in maritime expeditions. Gifted with a robust frame,\r\nconsummate self-assurance, and a ready tongue, he was well equipped\r\nfor intrigues, both amorous and political, when the outbreak of the\r\nRevolution gave his thoughts a more serious turn. Espousing the\r\nultra-democratic side, he yet contrived to emerge unscathed from the\r\nschisms which were fatal to less dextrous trimmers. He was present at\r\nthe siege of Toulon, and has striven in his \"Mémoires\" to disparage\r\nBuonaparte's services and exalt his own. At the crisis of Thermidor\r\nthe Convention intrusted him with the command of the \"army of the\r\ninterior,\" and the energy which he then displayed gained for him the\r\nsame position in the equally critical days of Vendémiaire. Though he\r\nsubsequently carped at the conduct of Buonaparte, his action proved\r\nhis complete confidence in that young officer's capacity: he at once\r\nsent for him, and intrusted him with most important duties. Herein\r\nlies the chief chance of immortality for the name of Barras; not that,\r\nas a terrorist, he slaughtered royalists at Toulon; not that he was\r\nthe military chief of the Thermidorians, who, from fear of their own\r\nnecks, ended the supremacy of Robespierre; not even that he degraded\r\nthe new _régime_ by a cynical display of all the worst vices of the\r\nold; but rather because he was now privileged to hold the stirrup for\r\nthe great captain who vaulted lightly into the saddle.\r\n\r\nThe present crisis certainly called for a man of skill and\r\ndetermination. The malcontents had been emboldened by the timorous\r\nactions of General Menou, who had previously been intrusted with the\r\ntask of suppressing the agitation. Owing to a praiseworthy desire to\r\navoid bloodshed, that general wasted time in parleying with the most\r\nrebellious of the \"sections\" of Paris. The Convention now appointed\r\nBarras to the command, while Buonaparte, Brune, Carteaux, Dupont,\r\nLoison, Vachot, and Vézu were charged to serve under him.[32] Such was\r\nthe decree of the Convention, which therefore refutes Napoleon's later\r\nclaim that he was in command, and that of his admirers that he was\r\nsecond in command.\r\n\r\nYet, intrusted from the outset by Barras with important duties, he\r\nunquestionably became the animating spirit of the defence. \"From the\r\nfirst,\" says Thiébault, \"his activity was astonishing: he seemed to be\r\neverywhere at once: he surprised people by his laconic, clear, and\r\nprompt orders: everybody was struck by the vigour of his arrangements,\r\nand passed from admiration to confidence, from confidence to\r\nenthusiasm.\" Everything now depended on skill and enthusiasm. The\r\ndefenders of the Convention, comprising some four or five thousand\r\ntroops of the line, and between one and two thousand patriots,\r\ngendarmes, and Invalides, were confronted by nearly thirty thousand\r\nNational Guards. The odds were therefore wellnigh as heavy as those\r\nwhich menaced Louis XVI. on the day of his final overthrow. But the\r\nplace of the yielding king was now filled by determined men, who saw\r\nthe needs of the situation. In the earlier scenes of the Revolution,\r\nBuonaparte had pondered on the efficacy of artillery in\r\nstreet-fighting--a fit subject for his geometrical genius. With a few\r\ncannon, he knew that he could sweep all the approaches to the palace;\r\nand, on Barras' orders, he despatched a dashing cavalry officer,\r\nMurat--a name destined to become famous from Madrid to Moscow--to\r\nbring the artillery from the neighbouring camp of Sablons. Murat\r\nsecured them before the malcontents of Paris could lay hands on them;\r\nand as the \"sections\" of Paris had yielded up their own cannon after\r\nthe affrays of May, they now lacked the most potent force in\r\nstreet-fighting. Their actions were also paralyzed by divided\r\ncounsels: their commander, an old general named Danican, moved his men\r\nhesitatingly; he wasted precious minutes in parleying, and thus gave\r\ntime to Barras' small but compact force to fight them in detail.\r\nBuonaparte had skilfully disposed his cannon to bear on the royalist\r\ncolumns that threatened the streets north of the Tuileries. But for\r\nsome time the two parties stood face to face, seeking to cajole or\r\nintimidate one another. As the autumn afternoon waned, shots were\r\nfired from some houses near the church of St. Roch, where the\r\nmalcontents had their headquarters.[33] At once the streets became the\r\nscene of a furious fight; furious but unequal; for Buonaparte's cannon\r\ntore away the heads of the malcontent columns. In vain did the\r\nroyalists pour in their volleys from behind barricades, or from the\r\nneighbouring houses: finally they retreated on the barricaded church,\r\nor fled down the Rue St. Honoré. Meanwhile their bands from across the\r\nriver, 5,000 strong, were filing across the bridges, and menaced the\r\nTuileries from that side, until here also they melted away before the\r\ngrapeshot and musketry poured into their front and flank. By six\r\no'clock the conflict was over. The fight presents few, if any,\r\nincidents which are authentic. The well-known engraving of Helman,\r\nwhich shows Buonaparte directing the storming of the church of St.\r\nRoch is unfortunately quite incorrect. He was not engaged there, but\r\nin the streets further east: the church was not stormed: the\r\nmalcontents held it all through the night, and quietly surrendered it\r\nnext morning.\r\n\r\nSuch was the great day of Vendémiaire. It cost the lives of about two\r\nhundred on each side; at least, that is the usual estimate, which\r\nseems somewhat incongruous with the stories of fusillading and\r\ncannonading at close quarters, until we remember that it is the custom\r\nof memoir-writers and newspaper editors to trick out the details of a\r\nfight, and in the case of civil warfare to minimise the bloodshed.\r\nCertainly the Convention acted with clemency in the hour of victory:\r\ntwo only of the rebel leaders were put to death; and it is pleasing to\r\nremember that when Menou was charged with treachery, Buonaparte used\r\nhis influence to procure his freedom.\r\n\r\nBourrienne states that in his later days the victor deeply regretted\r\nhis action in this day of Vendémiaire. The assertion seems\r\nincredible. The \"whiff of grapeshot\" crushed a movement which could\r\nhave led only to present anarchy, and probably would have brought\r\nFrance back to royalism of an odious type. It taught a severe lesson\r\nto a fickle populace which, according to Mme. de Staël, was hungering\r\nfor the spoils of place as much as for any political object. Of all\r\nthe events of his post-Corsican life, Buonaparte need surely never\r\nhave felt compunctions for Vendémiaire.[34]\r\n\r\nAfter four signal reverses in his career, he now enters on a path\r\nstrewn with glories. The first reward for his signal services to the\r\nRepublic was his appointment to be second in command of the army of\r\nthe interior; and when Barras resigned the first command, he took that\r\nresponsible post. But more brilliant honours were soon to follow, the\r\nfirst of a social character, the second purely military.\r\n\r\nBuonaparte had already appeared timidly and awkwardly at the _salon_\r\nof the voluptuous Barras, where the fair but frail Madame\r\nTallien--Notre Dame de Thermidor she was styled--dazzled Parisian\r\nsociety by her classic features and the uncinctured grace of her\r\nattire. There he reappeared, not in the threadbare uniform that had\r\nattracted the giggling notice of that giddy throng, but as the lion of\r\nthe society which his talents had saved. His previous attempts to gain\r\nthe hand of a lady had been unsuccessful. He had been refused, first\r\nby Mlle. Clary, sister of his brother Joseph's wife, and quite\r\nrecently by Madame Permon. Indeed, the scarecrow young officer had not\r\nbeen a brilliant match. But now he saw at that _salon_ a charming\r\nwidow, Josephine de Beauharnais, whose husband had perished in the\r\nTerror. The ardour of his southern temperament, long repressed by his\r\nprivations, speedily rekindles in her presence: his stiff, awkward\r\nmanners thaw under her smiles: his silence vanishes when she praises\r\nhis military gifts: he admires her tact, her sympathy, her beauty: he\r\ndetermines to marry her. The lady, on her part, seems to have been\r\nsomewhat terrified by her uncanny wooer: she comments questioningly on\r\nhis \"violent tenderness almost amounting to frenzy\": she notes\r\nuneasily his \"keen inexplicable gaze which imposes even on our\r\nDirectors\": How would this eager nature, this masterful energy,\r\nconsort with her own \"Creole nonchalance\"? She did well to ask herself\r\nwhether the general's almost volcanic passion would not soon exhaust\r\nitself, and turn from her own fading charms to those of women who\r\nwere his equals in age. Besides, when she frankly asked her own heart,\r\nshe found that she loved him not: she only admired him. Her chief\r\nconsolation was that if she married him, her friend Barras would help\r\nto gain for Buonaparte the command of the Army of Italy. The advice of\r\nBarras undoubtedly helped to still the questioning surmises of\r\nJosephine; and the wedding was celebrated, as a civil contract, on\r\nMarch 9th, 1796. With a pardonable coquetry, the bride entered her age\r\non the register as four years less than the thirty-four which had\r\npassed over her: while her husband, desiring still further to lessen\r\nthe disparity, entered his date of birth as 1768.\r\n\r\nA fortnight before the wedding, he had been appointed to command the\r\nArmy of Italy: and after a honeymoon of two days at Paris, he left his\r\nbride to take up his new military duties. Clearly, then, there was\r\nsome connection between this brilliant fortune and his espousal of\r\nJosephine. But the assertion that this command was the \"dowry\" offered\r\nby Barras to the somewhat reluctant bride is more piquant than\r\ncorrect. That the brilliance of Buonaparte's prospects finally\r\ndissipated her scruples may be frankly admitted. But the appointment\r\nto a command of a French army did not rest with Barras. He was only\r\none of the five Directors who now decided the chief details of\r\nadministration. His colleagues were Letourneur, Rewbell, La\r\nRéveillière-Lépeaux, and the great Carnot; and, as a matter of fact,\r\nit was the last-named who chiefly decided the appointment in question.\r\n\r\nHe had seen and pondered over the plan of campaign which Buonaparte\r\nhad designed for the Army of Italy; and the vigour of the conception,\r\nthe masterly appreciation of topographical details which it displayed,\r\nand the trenchant energy of its style had struck conviction to his\r\nstrategic genius. Buonaparte owed his command, not to a backstairs\r\nintrigue, as was currently believed in the army, but rather to his own\r\ncommanding powers. While serving with the Army of Italy in 1794, he\r\nhad carefully studied the coast-line and the passes leading inland;\r\nand, according to the well-known savant, Volney, the young officer,\r\nshortly after his release from imprisonment, sketched out to him and\r\nto a Commissioner of the Convention the details of the very plan of\r\ncampaign which was to carry him victoriously from the Genoese Riviera\r\ninto the heart of Austria.[35] While describing this masterpiece of\r\nstrategy, says Volney, Buonaparte spoke as if inspired. We can fancy\r\nthe wasted form dilating with a sense of power, the thin sallow cheeks\r\naglow with enthusiasm, the hawk-like eyes flashing at the sight of the\r\nhelpless Imperial quarry, as he pointed out on the map of Piedmont and\r\nLombardy the features which would favour a dashing invader and carry\r\nhim to the very gates of Vienna. The splendours of the Imperial Court\r\nat the Tuileries seem tawdry and insipid when compared with the\r\nintellectual grandeur which lit up that humble lodging at Nice with\r\nthe first rays that heralded the dawn of Italian liberation.\r\n\r\nWith the fuller knowledge which he had recently acquired, he now in\r\nJanuary, 1796, elaborated this plan of campaign, so that it at once\r\ngained Carnot's admiration. The Directors forwarded it to General\r\nSchérer, who was in command of the Army of Italy, but promptly\r\nreceived the \"brutal\" reply that the man who had drafted the plan\r\nought to come and carry it out. Long dissatisfied with Schérer's\r\ninactivity and constant complaints, the Directory now took him at his\r\nword, and replaced him by Buonaparte. Such is the truth about\r\nBuonaparte's appointment to the Army of Italy.\r\n\r\nTo Nice, then, the young general set out (March 21st) accompanied, or\r\nspeedily followed, by his faithful friends, Marmont and Junot, as well\r\nas by other officers of whose energy he was assured, Berthier, Murat,\r\nand Duroc. How much had happened since the early summer of 1795, when\r\nhe had barely the means to pay his way to Paris! A sure instinct had\r\ndrawn him to that hot-bed of intrigues. He had played a desperate\r\ngame, risking his commission in order that he might keep in close\r\ntouch with the central authority. His reward for this almost\r\nsuperhuman confidence in his own powers was correspondingly great; and\r\nnow, though he knew nothing of the handling of cavalry and infantry\r\nsave from books, he determined to lead the Army of Italy to a series\r\nof conquests that would rival those of Cæsar. In presence of a will so\r\nstubborn and genius so fervid, what wonder that a friend prophesied\r\nthat his halting-place would be either the throne or the scaffold?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIAN CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\n(1796)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the personality of Napoleon nothing is more remarkable than the\r\ncombination of gifts which in most natures are mutually exclusive; his\r\ninstincts were both political and military; his survey of a land took\r\nin not only the geographical environment but also the material welfare\r\nof the people. Facts, which his foes ignored, offered a firm fulcrum\r\nfor the leverage of his will: and their political edifice or their\r\nmilitary policy crumbled to ruin under an assault planned with\r\nconsummate skill and pressed home with relentless force.\r\n\r\nFor the exercise of all these gifts what land was so fitted as the\r\nmosaic of States which was dignified with the name of Italy?\r\n\r\nThat land had long been the battle-ground of the Bourbons and the\r\nHapsburgs; and their rivalries, aided by civic dissensions, had\r\nreduced the people that once had given laws to Europe into a condition\r\nof miserable weakness. Europe was once the battle-field of the Romans:\r\nItaly was now the battle-field of Europe. The Hapsburgs dominated the\r\nnorth, where they held the rich Duchy of Milan, along with the great\r\nstronghold of Mantua, and some scattered imperial fiefs. A scion of\r\nthe House of Austria reigned at Florence over the prosperous Duchy of\r\nTuscany. Modena and Lucca were under the general control of the Court\r\nof Vienna. The south of the peninsula, along with Sicily, was swayed\r\nby Ferdinand IV., a descendant of the Spanish Bourbons, who kept his\r\npeople in a condition of mediæval ignorance and servitude; and this\r\ndynasty controlled the Duchy of Parma. The Papal States were also sunk\r\nin the torpor of the Middle Ages; but in the northern districts of\r\nBologna and Ferrara, known as the \"Legations,\" the inhabitants still\r\nremembered the time of their independence, and chafed under the\r\nirritating restraints of Papal rule. This was seen when the leaven of\r\nFrench revolutionary thought began to ferment in Italian towns. Two\r\nyoung men of Bologna were so enamoured of the new ideas, as to raise\r\nan Italian tricolour flag, green, white, and red, and summon their\r\nfellow-citizens to revolt against the rule of the Pope's legate\r\n(November, 1794). The revolt was crushed, and the chief offenders were\r\nhanged; but elsewhere the force of democracy made itself felt,\r\nespecially among the more virile peoples of Northern Italy. Lombardy\r\nand Piedmont throbbed with suppressed excitement. Even when the King\r\nof Sardinia, Victor Amadeus III., was waging war against the French\r\nRepublic, the men of Turin were with difficulty kept from revolt; and,\r\nas we have seen, the Austro-Sardinian alliance was powerless to\r\nrecover Savoy and Nice from the soldiers of liberty or to guard the\r\nItalian Riviera from invasion.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Bonaparte--for he henceforth spelt his name thus--detected\r\nthe political weakness of the Hapsburgs' position in Italy. Masters of\r\neleven distinct peoples north of the Alps, how could they hope\r\npermanently to dominate a wholly alien people south of that great\r\nmountain barrier? The many failures of the old Ghibelline or Imperial\r\nparty in face of any popular impulse which moved the Italian nature to\r\nits depths revealed the artificiality of their rule. Might not such an\r\nimpulse be imparted by the French Revolution? And would not the hopes\r\nof national freedom and of emancipation from feudal imposts fire these\r\npeoples with zeal for the French cause? Evidently there were vast\r\npossibilities in a democratic propaganda. At the outset Bonaparte's\r\nracial sympathies were warmly aroused for the liberation of\r\nItaly; and though his judgment was to be warped by the promptings of\r\nambition, he never lost sight of the welfare of the people whence he\r\nwas descended. In his \"Memoirs written at St. Helena\" he summed up his\r\nconvictions respecting the Peninsula in this statesmanlike utterance:\r\n\"Italy, isolated within its natural limits, separated by the sea and\r\nby very high mountains from the rest of Europe, seems called to be a\r\ngreat and powerful nation.... Unity in manners, language, literature\r\nought finally, in a future more or less remote, to unite its\r\ninhabitants under a single government.... Rome is beyond doubt the\r\ncapital which the Italians will one day choose.\" A prophetic saying:\r\nit came from a man who, as conqueror and organizer, awakened that\r\npeople from the torpor of centuries and breathed into it something of\r\nhis own indomitable energy.\r\n\r\nAnd then again, the Austrian possessions south of the Alps were\r\ndifficult to hold for purely military reasons. They were separated\r\nfrom Vienna by difficult mountain ranges through which armies\r\nstruggled with difficulty. True, Mantua was a formidable stronghold,\r\nbut no fortress could make the Milanese other than a weak and\r\nstraggling territory, the retention of which by the Court of Vienna\r\nwas a defiance to the gospel of nature of which Rousseau was the\r\nherald and Bonaparte the militant exponent.\r\n\r\nThe Austro-Sardinian forces were now occupying the pass which\r\nseparates the Apennines from the Maritime Alps north of the town of\r\nSavona. They were accordingly near the headwaters of the Bormida and\r\nthe Tanaro, two of the chief affluents of the River Po: and roads\r\nfollowing those river valleys led, the one north-east, in the\r\ndirection of Milan, the other north-west towards Turin, the Sardinian\r\ncapital. A wedge of mountainous country separated these roads as they\r\ndiverged from the neighbourhood of Montenotte. Here obviously was the\r\nvulnerable point of the Austro-Sardinian position. Here therefore\r\nBonaparte purposed to deliver his first strokes, foreseeing that,\r\nshould he sever the allies, he would have in his favour every\r\nadvantage both political and topographical.\r\n\r\nAll this was possible to a commander who could overcome the initial\r\ndifficulties. But these difficulties were enormous. The position of\r\nthe French Army of Italy in March, 1796, was precarious. Its\r\ndetachments, echelonned near the coast from Savona to Loano, and\r\nthence to Nice, or inland to the Col di Tende, comprised in all\r\n42,000 men, as against the Austro-Sardinian forces amounting to\r\n52,000 men.[36] Moreover, the allies occupied strong positions on the\r\nnorthern slopes of the Maritime Alps and Apennines, and, holding the\r\ninner and therefore shorter curve, they could by a dextrous\r\nconcentration have pushed their more widely scattered opponents on to\r\nthe shore, where the republicans would have been harassed by the guns\r\nof the British cruisers. Finally, Bonaparte's troops were badly\r\nequipped, worse clad, and were not paid at all. On his arrival at Nice\r\nat the close of March, the young commander had to disband one\r\nbattalion for mutinous conduct.[37] For a brief space it seemed\r\ndoubtful how the army would receive this slim, delicate-looking youth,\r\nknown hitherto only as a skilful artillerist at Toulon and in the\r\nstreets of Paris. But he speedily gained the respect and confidence of\r\nthe rank and file, not only by stern punishment of the mutineers, but\r\nby raising money from a local banker, so as to make good some of the\r\nlong arrears of pay. Other grievances he rectified by prompt\r\nreorganization of the commissariat and kindred departments. But, above\r\nall, by his burning words he thrilled them: \"Soldiers, you are half\r\nstarved and half naked. The Government owes you much, but can do\r\nnothing for you. Your patience and courage are honourable to you, but\r\nthey procure you neither advantage nor glory. I am about to lead you\r\ninto the most fertile valleys of the world: there you will find\r\nflourishing cities and teeming provinces: there you will reap honour,\r\nglory, and riches. Soldiers of the Army of Italy, will you lack\r\ncourage?\" Two years previously so open a bid for the soldiers'\r\nallegiance would have conducted any French commander forthwith to the\r\nguillotine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP TO ILLUSTRATE THE CAMPAIGNS IN NORTH ITALY.]\r\n\r\nBut much had changed since the days of Robespierre's supremacy;\r\nSpartan austerity had vanished; and the former insane jealousy of\r\nindividual pre-eminence was now favouring a startling reaction which\r\nwas soon to install the one supremely able man as absolute master of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nBonaparte's conduct produced a deep impression alike on troops and\r\nofficers. From Masséna his energy and his trenchant orders extorted\r\nadmiration: and the tall swaggering Augereau shrank beneath the\r\nintellectual superiority of his gaze. Moreover, at the beginning of\r\nApril the French received reinforcements which raised their total to\r\n49,300 men, and gave them a superiority of force; for though the\r\nallies had 52,000, yet they were so widely scattered as to be inferior\r\nin any one district. Besides, the Austrian commander, Beaulieu, was\r\nseventy-one years of age, had only just been sent into Italy, with\r\nwhich land he was ill acquainted, and found one-third of his troops\r\ndown with sickness.[38]\r\n\r\nBonaparte now began to concentrate his forces near Savona. Fortune\r\nfavoured him even before the campaign commenced. The snows of winter,\r\nstill lying on the mountains, though thawing on the southern slopes,\r\nhelped to screen his movements from the enemy's outposts; and the\r\nFrench vanguard pushed along the coastline even as far as Voltri. This\r\nmovement was designed to coerce the Senate of Genoa into payment of a\r\nfine for its acquiescence in the seizure of a French vessel by a\r\nBritish cruiser within its neutral roadstead; but it served to alarm\r\nBeaulieu, who, breaking up his cantonments, sent a strong column\r\ntowards that city. At the time this circumstance greatly annoyed\r\nBonaparte, who had hoped to catch the Imperialists dozing in their\r\nwinter quarters. Yet it is certain that the hasty move of their left\r\nflank towards Voltri largely contributed to that brilliant opening of\r\nBonaparte's campaign, which his admirers have generally regarded as\r\ndue solely to his genius.[39] For, when Beaulieu had thrust his column\r\ninto the broken coast district between Genoa and Voltri, he severed it\r\ndangerously far from his centre, which marched up the valley of the\r\neastern branch of the Bormida to occupy the passes of the Apennines\r\nnorth of Savona. This, again, was by no means in close touch with the\r\nSardinian allies encamped further to the west in and beyond Ceva.\r\nBeaulieu, writing at a later date to Colonel Graham, the English\r\n_attaché_ at his headquarters, ascribed his first disasters to\r\nArgenteau, his lieutenant at Montenotte, who employed only a third of\r\nthe forces placed under his command. But division of forces was\r\ncharacteristic of the Austrians in all their operations, and they now\r\ngave a fine opportunity to any enterprising opponent who should crush\r\ntheir weak and unsupported centre. In obedience to orders from Vienna,\r\nBeaulieu assumed the offensive; but he brought his chief force to bear\r\non the French vanguard at Voltri, which he drove in with some loss.\r\nWhile he was occupying Voltri, the boom of cannon echoing across the\r\nmountains warned his outposts that the real campaign was opening in\r\nthe broken country north of Savona.[40] There the weak Austrian centre\r\nhad occupied a ridge or plateau above the village of Montenotte,\r\nthrough which ran the road leading to Alessandria and Milan.\r\nArgenteau's attack partly succeeded: but the stubborn bravery of a\r\nFrench detachment checked it before the redoubt which commanded the\r\nsouthern prolongation of the heights named Monte-Legino.[41]\r\n\r\nSuch was the position of affairs when Bonaparte hurried up. On the\r\nfollowing day (April 12th), massing the French columns of attack\r\nunder cover of an early morning mist, he moved them to their\r\npositions, so that the first struggling rays of sunlight revealed to\r\nthe astonished Austrians the presence of an army ready to crush their\r\nfront and turn their flanks. For a time the Imperialists struggled\r\nbravely against the superior forces in their front; but when Masséna\r\npressed round their right wing, they gave way and beat a speedy\r\nretreat to save themselves from entire capture. Bonaparte took no\r\nactive share in the battle: he was, very properly, intent on the wider\r\nproblem of severing the Austrians from their allies, first by the\r\nturning movement of Masséna, and then by pouring other troops into the\r\ngap thus made. In this he entirely succeeded. The radical defects in\r\nthe Austrian dispositions left them utterly unable to withstand the\r\nblows which he now showered upon them. The Sardinians were too far\r\naway on the west to help Argenteau in his hour of need: they were in\r\nand beyond Ceva, intent on covering the road to Turin: whereas, as\r\nNapoleon himself subsequently wrote, they should have been near enough\r\nto their allies to form one powerful army, which, at Dego or\r\nMontenotte, would have defended both Turin and Milan. \"United, the two\r\nforces would have been superior to the French army: separated, they\r\nwere lost.\"\r\n\r\nThe configuration of the ground favoured Bonaparte's plan of driving\r\nthe Imperialists down the valley of the Bormida in a north-easterly\r\ndirection; and the natural desire of a beaten general to fall back\r\ntowards his base of supplies also impelled Beaulieu and Argenteau to\r\nretire towards Milan. But that would sever their connections with the\r\nSardinians, whose base of supplies, Turin, lay in a north-westerly\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nBonaparte therefore hurled his forces at once against the Austrians\r\nand a Sardinian contingent at Millesimo, and defeated them, Augereau's\r\ndivision cutting off the retreat of twelve hundred of their men under\r\nProvera. Weakened by this second blow, the allies fell back on the\r\nintrenched village of Dego. Their position was of a strength\r\nproportionate to its strategic importance; for its loss would\r\ncompletely sever all connection between their two main armies save by\r\ndevious routes many miles in their rear. They therefore clung\r\ndesperately to the six mamelons and redoubts which barred the valley\r\nand dominated some of the neighbouring heights. Yet such was the\r\nsuperiority of the French in numbers that these positions were\r\nspeedily turned by Masséna, whom Bonaparte again intrusted with the\r\nmovement on the enemy's flank and rear. A strange event followed. The\r\nvictors, while pillaging the country for the supplies which\r\nBonaparte's sharpest orders failed to draw from the magazines and\r\nstores on the sea-coast, were attacked in the dead of night by five\r\nAustrian battalions that had been ordered up to support their\r\ncountrymen at Dego. These, after straying among the mountains, found\r\nthemselves among bands of the marauding French, whom they easily\r\nscattered, seizing Dego itself. Apprised of this mishap, Bonaparte\r\nhurried up more troops from the rear, and on the 15th recovered the\r\nprize which had so nearly been snatched from his grasp. Had Beaulieu\r\nat this time thrown all his forces on the French, he might have\r\nretrieved his first misfortunes: but foresight and energy were not to\r\nbe found at the Austrian headquarters: the surprise at Dego was the\r\nwork of a colonel; and for many years to come the incompetence of\r\ntheir aged commanders was to paralyze the fine fighting qualities of\r\nthe \"white-coats.\" In three conflicts they had been outmanoeuvred and\r\noutnumbered, and drew in their shattered columns to Acqui.\r\n\r\nThe French commander now led his columns westward against the\r\nSardinians, who had fallen back on their fortified camp at Ceva, in\r\nthe upper valley of the Tanaro. There they beat off one attack of the\r\nFrench. A check in front of a strongly intrenched position was\r\nserious. It might have led to a French disaster, had the Austrians\r\nbeen able to bring aid to their allies. Bonaparte even summoned a\r\ncouncil of war to deliberate on the situation. As a rule, a council of\r\nwar gives timid advice. This one strongly advised a second attack on\r\nthe camp--a striking proof of the ardour which then nerved the\r\nrepublican generals. Not yet were they _condottieri_ carving out\r\nfortunes by their swords: not yet were they the pampered minions of an\r\nautocrat, intent primarily on guarding the estates which his favour\r\nhad bestowed. Timidity was rather the mark of their opponents. When\r\nthe assault on the intrenchments of Ceva was about to be renewed, the\r\nSardinian forces were discerned filing away westwards. Their general\r\nindulged the fond hope of holding the French at bay at several\r\nstrong natural positions on his march. He was bitterly to rue his\r\nerror. The French divisions of Sérurier and Dommartin closed in on\r\nhim, drove him from Mondovi, and away towards Turin.\r\n\r\nBonaparte had now completely succeeded. Using to the full the\r\nadvantage of his central position between the widely scattered\r\ndetachments of his foes, he had struck vigorously at their natural\r\npoint of junction, Montenotte, and by three subsequent successes--for\r\nthe evacuation of Ceva can scarcely be called a French victory--had\r\nforced them further and further apart until Turin was almost within\r\nhis power.\r\n\r\nIt now remained to push these military triumphs to their natural\r\nconclusion, and impose terms of peace on the House of Savoy, which was\r\nsecretly desirous of peace. The Directors had ordered Bonaparte that\r\nhe should seek to detach Sardinia from the Austrian alliance by\r\nholding out the prospect of a valuable compensation for the loss of\r\nSavoy and Nice in the fertile Milanese.[42] The prospect of this rich\r\nprize would, the Directors surmised, dissolve the Austro-Sardinian\r\nalliance, as soon as the allies had felt the full vigour of the French\r\narms. Not that Bonaparte himself was to conduct these negotiations. He\r\nwas to forward to the Directory all offers of submission. Nay, he was\r\nnot empowered to grant on his own responsibility even an armistice. He\r\nwas merely to push the foe hard, and feed his needy soldiers on the\r\nconquered territory. He was to be solely a general, never a\r\nnegotiator.\r\n\r\nThe Directors herein showed keen jealousy or striking ignorance of\r\nmilitary affairs. How could he keep the Austrians quiet while envoys\r\npassed between Turin and Paris? All the dictates of common sense\r\nrequired him to grant an armistice to the Court of Turin before the\r\nAustrians could recover from their recent disasters. But the King of\r\nSardinia drew him from a perplexing situation by instructing Colli to\r\nmake overtures for an armistice as preliminary to a peace. At once the\r\nFrench commander replied that such powers belonged to the Directory;\r\nbut as for an armistice, it would only be possible if the Court of\r\nTurin placed in his hands three fortresses, Coni, Tortona, and\r\nAlessandria, besides guaranteeing the transit of French armies through\r\nPiedmont and the passage of the Po at Valenza. Then, with his\r\nunfailing belief in accomplished facts, Bonaparte pushed on his troops\r\nto Cherasco.\r\n\r\nNear that town he received the Piedmontese envoys; and from the pen of\r\none of them we have an account of the general's behaviour in his first\r\nessay in diplomacy. His demeanour was marked by that grave and frigid\r\ncourtesy which was akin to Piedmontese customs. In reply to the\r\nsuggestions of the envoys that some of the conditions were of little\r\nvalue to the French, he answered: \"The Republic, in intrusting to me\r\nthe command of an army, has credited me with possessing enough\r\ndiscernment to judge of what that army requires, without having\r\nrecourse to the advice of my enemy.\" Apart, however, from this\r\nsarcasm, which was uttered in a hard and biting voice, his tone was\r\ncoldly polite. He reserved his home thrust for the close of the\r\nconference. When it had dragged on till considerably after noon with\r\nno definite result, he looked at his watch and exclaimed: \"Gentlemen,\r\nI warn you that a general attack is ordered for two o'clock, and that\r\nif I am not assured that Coni will be put in my hands before\r\nnightfall, the attack will not be postponed for one moment. It may\r\nhappen to me to lose battles, but no one shall ever see me lose\r\nminutes either by over-confidence or by sloth.\" The terms of the\r\narmistice of Cherasco were forthwith signed (April 28th); they were\r\nsubstantially the same as those first offered by the victor. During\r\nthe luncheon which followed, the envoys were still further impressed\r\nby his imperturbable confidence and trenchant phrases; as when he told\r\nthem that the campaign was the exact counterpart of what he had\r\nplanned in 1794; or described a council of war as a convenient device\r\nfor covering cowardice or irresolution in the commander; or asserted\r\nthat nothing could now stop him before the walls of Mantua.[43]\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the French army was at that time so disorganized\r\nby rapine as scarcely to have withstood a combined and vigorous attack\r\nby Beaulieu and Colli. The republicans, long exposed to hunger and\r\nprivations, were now revelling in the fertile plains of Piedmont.\r\nLarge bands of marauders ranged the neighbouring country, and the\r\nregiments were often reduced to mere companies. From the grave risks\r\nof this situation Bonaparte was rescued by the timidity of the Court\r\nof Turin, which signed the armistice at Cherasco eighteen days after\r\nthe commencement of the campaign. A fortnight later the preliminaries\r\nof peace were signed between France and the King of Sardinia, by which\r\nthe latter yielded up his provinces of Savoy and Nice, and renounced\r\nthe alliance with Austria. Great indignation was felt in the\r\nImperialist camp at this news; and it was freely stated that the\r\nPiedmontese had let themselves be beaten in order to compass a peace\r\nthat had been tacitly agreed upon in the month of January.[44]\r\n\r\nEven before this auspicious event, Bonaparte's despatches to the\r\nDirectors were couched in almost imperious terms, which showed that he\r\nfelt himself the master of the situation. He advised them as to their\r\npolicy towards Sardinia, pointing out that, as Victor Amadeus had\r\nyielded up three important fortresses, he was practically in the hands\r\nof the French: \"If you do not accept peace with him, if your plan is\r\nto dethrone him, you must amuse him for a few decades[45] and must\r\nwarn me: I then seize Valenza and march on Turin.\" In military\r\naffairs the young general showed that he would brook no interference\r\nfrom Paris. He requested the Directory to draft 15,000 men from\r\nKellermann's Army of the Alps to reinforce him: \"That will give me an\r\narmy of 45,000 men, of which possibly I may send a part to Rome. If\r\nyou continue your confidence and approve these plans, I am sure of\r\nsuccess: Italy is yours.\" Somewhat later, the Directors proposed to\r\ngrant the required reinforcements, but stipulated for the retention of\r\npart of the army in the Milanese _under the command of Kellermann_.\r\nThereupon Bonaparte replied (May 14th) that, as the Austrians had been\r\nreinforced, it was highly impolitic to divide the command. Each\r\ngeneral had his own way of making war. Kellermann, having more\r\nexperience, would doubtless do it better: but both together would do\r\nit very badly.\r\n\r\nAgain the Directors had blundered. In seeking to subject Bonaparte to\r\nthe same rules as had been imposed on all French generals since the\r\ntreason of Dumouriez in 1793, they were doubtless consulting the vital\r\ninterests of the Commonwealth. But, while striving to avert all\r\npossibilities of Cæsarism, they now sinned against that elementary\r\nprinciple of strategy which requires unity of design in military\r\noperations. Bonaparte's retort was unanswerable, and nothing more was\r\nheard of the luckless proposal.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the peace with the House of Savoy had thrown open the\r\nMilanese to Bonaparte's attack. Holding three Sardinian fortresses, he\r\nhad an excellent base of operations; for the lands restored to the\r\nKing of Sardinia were to remain subject to requisitions for the French\r\narmy until the general peace. The Austrians, on the other hand, were\r\nweakened by the hostility of their Italian subjects, and, worst of\r\nall, they depended ultimately on reinforcements drawn from beyond the\r\nAlps by way of Mantua. In the rich plains of Lombardy they, however,\r\nhad one advantage which was denied to them among the rocks of the\r\nApennines. Their generals could display the tactical skill on which\r\nthey prided themselves, and their splendid cavalry had some chance of\r\nemulating the former exploits of the Hungarian and Croatian horse.\r\nThey therefore awaited the onset of the French, little dismayed by\r\nrecent disasters, and animated by the belief that their antagonist,\r\nunversed in regular warfare, would at once lose in the plains the\r\nbubble reputation gained in ravines. But the country in the second\r\npart of this campaign was not less favourable to Bonaparte's peculiar\r\ngifts than that in which he had won his first laurels as commander.\r\nAmidst the Apennines, where only small bodies of men could be moved, a\r\ngeneral inexperienced in the handling of cavalry and infantry could\r\nmake his first essays in tactics with fair chances of success. Speed,\r\nenergy, and the prompt seizure of a commanding central position were\r\nthe prime requisites; the handling of vast masses of men was\r\nimpossible. The plains of Lombardy facilitated larger movements; but\r\neven here the numerous broad swift streams fed by the Alpine snows,\r\nand the network of irrigating dykes, favoured the designs of a young\r\nand daring leader who saw how to use natural obstacles so as to baffle\r\nand ensnare his foes. Bonaparte was now to show that he excelled his\r\nenemies, not only in quickness of eye and vigour of intellect, but\r\nalso in the minutiæ of tactics and in those larger strategic\r\nconceptions which decide the fate of nations. In the first place,\r\nhaving the superiority of force, he was able to attack. This is an\r\nadvantage at all times: for the aggressor can generally mislead his\r\nadversary by a series of feints until the real blow can be delivered\r\nwith crushing effect. Such has been the aim of all great leaders from\r\nthe time of Epaminondas and Alexander, Hannibal and Cæsar, down to the\r\nage of Luxembourg, Marlborough, and Frederick the Great. Aggressive\r\ntactics were particularly suited to the French soldiery, always eager,\r\nactive, and intelligent, and now endowed with boundless enthusiasm in\r\ntheir cause and in their leader.\r\n\r\nThen again he was fully aware of the inherent vice of the Austrian\r\nsituation. It was as if an unwieldy organism stretched a vulnerable\r\nlimb across the huge barrier of the Alps, exposing it to the attack of\r\na compacter body. It only remained for Bonaparte to turn against his\r\nfoes the smaller geographical features on which they too implicitly\r\nrelied. Beaulieu had retired beyond the Po and the Ticino, expecting\r\nthat the attack on the Milanese would be delivered across the latter\r\nstream by the ordinary route, which crossed it at Pavia. Near that\r\ncity the Austrians occupied a strong position with 26,000 men, while\r\nother detachments patrolled the banks of the Ticino further north, and\r\nthose of the Po towards Valenza, only 5,000 men being sent towards\r\nPiacenza. Bonaparte, however, was not minded to take the ordinary\r\nroute. He determined to march, not as yet on the north of the River\r\nPo, where snow-swollen streams coursed down from the Alps, but rather\r\non the south side, where the Apennines throw off fewer streams and\r\nalso of smaller volume. From the fortress of Tortona he could make a\r\nrush at Piacenza, cross the Po there, and thus gain the Milanese\r\nalmost without a blow. To this end he had stipulated in the recent\r\nterms of peace that he might cross the Po at Valenza; and now, amusing\r\nhis foes by feints on that side, he vigorously pushed his main columns\r\nalong the southern bank of the Po, where they gathered up all the\r\navailable boats. The vanguard, led by the impetuous Lannes, seized the\r\nferry at Piacenza, before the Austrian horse appeared, and scattered a\r\nsquadron or two which strove to drive them back into the river (May\r\n7th).\r\n\r\nTime was thus gained for a considerable number of French to cross the\r\nriver in boats or by the ferry. Working under the eye of their leader,\r\nthe French conquered all obstacles: a bridge of boats soon spanned\r\nthe stream, and was defended by a _tête de pont_; and with forces\r\nabout equal in number to Liptay's Austrians, the republicans advanced\r\nnorthwards, and, after a tough struggle, dislodged their foes from the\r\nvillage of Fombio. This success drove a solid wedge between Liptay and\r\nhis commander-in-chief, who afterwards bitterly blamed him, first for\r\nretreating, and secondly for not reporting his retreat to\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, however, that Liptay had only 5,000 men (not the\r\n8,000 which Napoleon and French historians have credited to him), that\r\nhe was sent by Beaulieu to Piacenza too late to prevent the crossing\r\nby the French, and that at the close of the fight on the following day\r\nhe was completely cut off from communicating with his superior.\r\nBeaulieu, with his main force, advanced on Fombio, stumbled on the\r\nFrench, where he looked to find Liptay, and after a confused fight\r\nsucceeded in disengaging himself and withdrawing towards Lodi, where\r\nthe high-road leading to Mantua crossed the River Adda. To that stream\r\nhe directed his remaining forces to retire. He thereby left Milan\r\nuncovered (except for the garrison which held the citadel), and\r\nabandoned more than the half of Lombardy; but, from the military point\r\nof view, his retreat to the Adda was thoroughly sound. Yet here again\r\na movement strategically correct was marred by tactical blunders. Had\r\nhe concentrated all his forces at the nearest point of the Adda which\r\nthe French could cross, namely Pizzighetone, he would have rendered\r\nany flank march of theirs to the northward extremely hazardous; but he\r\nhad not yet sufficiently learned from his terrible teacher the need of\r\nconcentration; and, having at least three passages to guard, he kept\r\nhis forces too spread out to oppose a vigorous move against any one of\r\nthem. Indeed, he despaired of holding the line of the Adda, and\r\nretired eastwards with a great part of his army.\r\n\r\nConsequently, when Bonaparte, only three days after the seizure of\r\nPiacenza, threw his almost undivided force against the town of Lodi,\r\nhis passage was disputed only by the rearguard, whose anxiety to cover\r\nthe retreat of a belated detachment far exceeded their determination\r\nto defend the bridge over the Adda. This was a narrow structure, some\r\neighty fathoms long, standing high above the swift but shallow river.\r\nResolutely held by well-massed troops and cannon, it might have cost\r\nthe French a severe struggle: but the Imperialists were badly\r\nhandled: some were posted in and around the town which was between the\r\nriver and the advancing French; and the weak walls of Lodi were soon\r\nescaladed by the impetuous republicans. The Austrian commander,\r\nSebottendorf, now hastily ranged his men along the eastern bank of the\r\nriver, so as to defend the bridge and prevent any passage of the river\r\nby boats or by a ford above the town. The Imperialists numbered only\r\n9,627 men; they were discouraged by defeats and by the consciousness\r\nthat no serious stand could be attempted before they reached the\r\nneighbourhood of Mantua; and their efforts to break down the bridge\r\nwere now frustrated by the French, who, posted behind the walls of\r\nLodi on the higher bank of the stream, swept their opponents' position\r\nwith a searching artillery fire. Having shaken the constancy of his\r\nfoes and refreshed his own infantry by a brief rest in Lodi, Bonaparte\r\nat 6 p.m. secretly formed a column of his choicest troops and hurled\r\nit against the bridge. A hot fire of grapeshot and musketry tore its\r\nfront, and for a time the column bent before the iron hail. But,\r\nencouraged by the words of their young leader, generals, corporals,\r\nand grenadiers pressed home their charge. This time, aided by\r\nsharp-shooters who waded to islets in the river, the assailants\r\ncleared the bridge, bayoneted the Austrian cannoneers, attacked the\r\nfirst and second lines of supporting foot, and, when reinforced,\r\ncompelled horse and foot to retreat towards Mantua.[46]\r\nSuch was the affair of Lodi (May 10th). A legendary\r\nglamour hovers around all the details of this conflict and invests it\r\nwith fictitious importance. Beaulieu's main force was far away, and\r\nthere was no hope of entrapping anything more than the rear of his\r\narmy. Moreover, if this were the object, why was not the flank move of\r\nthe French cavalry above Lodi pushed home earlier in the fight? This,\r\nif supported by infantry, could have outflanked the enemy while the\r\nperilous rush was made against the bridge; and such a turning movement\r\nwould probably have enveloped the Austrian force while it was being\r\nshattered in front. That is the view in which the strategist,\r\nClausewitz, regards this encounter. Far different was the impression\r\nwhich it created among the soldiers and Frenchmen at large. They\r\nvalued a commander more for bravery of the bull-dog type than for any\r\npowers of reasoning and subtle combination. These, it is true,\r\nBonaparte had already shown. He now enchanted the soldiery by dealing\r\na straight sharp blow. It had a magical effect on their minds. On the\r\nevening of that day the French soldiers, with antique republican\r\n_camaraderie_, saluted their commander as _le petit caporal_ for his\r\npersonal bravery in the fray, and this endearing phrase helped to\r\nimmortalize the affair of the bridge of Lodi.[47] It shot a thrill of\r\nexultation through France. With pardonable exaggeration, men told how\r\nhe charged at the head of the column, and, with Lannes, was the first\r\nto reach the opposite side; and later generations have figured him\r\ncharging before his tall grenadiers--a feat that was actually\r\nperformed by Lannes, Berthier, Masséna, Cervoni, and Dallemagne. It\r\nwas all one. Bonaparte alone was the hero of the day. He reigned\r\nsupreme in the hearts of the soldiers, and he saw the importance of\r\nthis conquest. At St. Helena he confessed to Montholon that it was the\r\nvictory of Lodi which fanned his ambition into a steady flame.\r\n\r\nA desire of stimulating popular enthusiasm throughout Italy impelled\r\nthe young victor to turn away from his real objective, the fortress of\r\nMantua, to the political capital of Lombardy. The people of Milan\r\nhailed their French liberators with enthusiasm: they rained flowers on\r\nthe bronzed soldiers of liberty, and pointed to their tattered\r\nuniforms and worn-out shoes as proofs of their triumphant energy:\r\nabove all, they gazed with admiration, not unmixed with awe, at the\r\nthin pale features of the young commander, whose plain attire bespoke\r\na Spartan activity, whose ardent gaze and decisive gestures proclaimed\r\na born leader of men. Forthwith he arranged for the investment of the\r\ncitadel where eighteen hundred Austrians held out: he then received\r\nthe chief men of the city with easy Italian grace; and in the evening\r\nhe gave a sumptuous ball, at which all the dignity, wealth, and beauty\r\nof the old Lombard capital shone resplendent. For a brief space all\r\nwent well between the Lombards and their liberators. He received with\r\nflattering distinction the chief artists and men of letters, and also\r\nsought to quicken the activity of the University of Pavia. Political\r\nclubs and newspapers multiplied throughout Lombardy; and actors,\r\nauthors, and editors joined in a pæan of courtly or fawning praise, to\r\nthe new Scipio, Cæsar, Hannibal, and Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThere were other reasons why the Lombards should worship the young\r\nvictor. Apart from the admiration which a gifted race ever feels for\r\nso fascinating a combination of youthful grace with intellectual power\r\nand martial prowess, they believed that this Italian hero would call\r\nthe people to political activity, perchance even to national\r\nindependence. For this their most ardent spirits had sighed,\r\nconspired, or fought during the eighty-three years of the Austrian\r\noccupation. Ever since the troublous times of Dante there had been\r\nprophetic souls who caught the vision of a new Italy, healed of her\r\ncountless schisms, purified from her social degradations, and uniting\r\nthe prowess of her ancient life with the gentler arts of the present\r\nfor the perfection of her own powers and for the welfare of mankind.\r\nThe gleam of this vision had shone forth even amidst the thunder claps\r\nof the French Revolution; and now that the storm had burst over the\r\nplains of Lombardy, ecstatic youths seemed to see the vision embodied\r\nin the person of Bonaparte himself. At the first news of the success\r\nat Lodi the national colours were donned as cockades, or waved\r\ndefiance from balconies and steeples to the Austrian garrisons. All\r\ntruly Italian hearts believed that the French victories heralded the\r\ndawn of political freedom not only for Lombardy, but for the whole\r\npeninsula.\r\n\r\nBonaparte's first actions increased these hopes. He abolished the\r\nAustrian machinery of government, excepting the Council of State, and\r\napproved the formation of provisional municipal councils and of a\r\nNational Guard. At the same time, he wrote guardedly to the Directors\r\nat Paris, asking whether they proposed to organize Lombardy as a\r\nrepublic, as it was much more ripe for this form of government than\r\nPiedmont. Further than this he could not go; but at a later date he\r\ndid much to redeem his first promises to the people of Northern Italy.\r\n\r\nThe fair prospect was soon overclouded by the financial measures urged\r\non the young commander from Paris, measures which were disastrous to\r\nthe Lombards and degrading to the liberators themselves. The Directors\r\nhad recently bidden him to press hard on the Milanese, and levy large\r\ncontributions in money, provisions, and objects of art, seeing that\r\nthey did not intend to keep this country.[48] Bonaparte accordingly\r\nissued a proclamation (May 19th), imposing on Lombardy the sum of\r\ntwenty million francs, remarking that it was a very light sum for so\r\nfertile a country. Only two days before he had in a letter to the\r\nDirectors described it as exhausted by five years of war. As for the\r\nassertion that the army needed this sum, it may be compared with his\r\nprivate notification to the Directory, three days after his\r\nproclamation, that they might speedily count on six to eight millions\r\nof the Lombard contribution, as lying ready at their disposal, \"it\r\nbeing over and above what the army requires.\" This is the first\r\ndefinite suggestion by Bonaparte of that system of bleeding conquered\r\nlands for the benefit of the French Exchequer, which enabled him\r\nspeedily to gain power over the Directors. Thenceforth they began to\r\nconnive at his diplomatic irregularities, and even to urge on his\r\nexpeditions into wealthy districts, provided that the spoils went to\r\nParis; while the conqueror, on his part, was able tacitly to assume\r\nthat tone of authority with which the briber treats the bribed.[49]\r\n\r\nThe exaction of this large sum, and of various requisites for the\r\narmy, as well as the \"extraction\" of works of art for the benefit of\r\nFrench museums, at once aroused the bitterest feelings. The loss of\r\npriceless treasures, such as the manuscript of Virgil which had\r\nbelonged to Petrarch, and the masterpieces of Raphael and Leonardo da\r\nVinci, might perhaps have been borne: it concerned only the cultured\r\nfew, and their effervescence was soon quelled by patrols of French\r\ncavalry. Far different was it with the peasants between Milan and\r\nPavia. Drained by the white-coats, they now refused to be bled for the\r\nbenefit of the blue-coats of France. They rushed to arms. The city of\r\nPavia defied the attack of a French column until cannon battered in\r\nits gates. Then the republicans rushed in, massacred all the armed men\r\nfor some hours, and glutted their lust and rapacity. By order of\r\nBonaparte, the members of the municipal council were condemned to\r\nexecution; but a delay occurred before this ferocious order was\r\ncarried out, and it was subsequently mitigated. Two hundred hostages\r\nwere, however, sent away into France as a guarantee for the good\r\nbehaviour of the unfortunate city: whereupon the chief announced to\r\nthe Directory that this would serve as a useful lesson to the peoples\r\nof Italy.\r\n\r\nIn one sense this was correct. It gave the Italians a true insight\r\ninto French methods; and painful emotions thrilled the peoples of the\r\npeninsula when they realized at what a price their liberation was to\r\nbe effected. Yet it is unfair to lay the chief blame on Bonaparte for\r\nthe pillage of Lombardy. His actions were only a development of\r\nexisting revolutionary customs; but never had these demoralizing\r\nmeasures been so thoroughly enforced as in the present system of\r\nliberation and blackmail. Lombardy was ransacked with an almost Vandal\r\nrapacity. Bonaparte desired little for himself. His aim ever was power\r\nrather than wealth. Riches he valued only as a means to political\r\nsupremacy. But he took care to place the Directors and all his\r\ninfluential officers deeply in his debt. To the five _soi-disant_\r\nrulers of France he sent one hundred horses, the finest that could be\r\nfound in Lombardy, to replace \"the poor creatures which now draw your\r\ncarriages\";[50] to his officers his indulgence was passive, but\r\nusually effective. Marmont states that Bonaparte once reproached him\r\nfor his scrupulousness in returning the whole of a certain sum which\r\nhe had been commissioned to recover. \"At that time,\" says Marmont, \"we\r\nstill retained a flower of delicacy on these subjects.\" This Alpine\r\ngentian was soon to fade in the heats of the plains. Some generals\r\nmade large fortunes, eminently so Masséna, first in plunder as in the\r\nfray. And yet the commander, who was so lenient to his generals,\r\nfilled his letters to the Directory with complaints about the cloud of\r\nFrench commissioners, dealers, and other civilian harpies who battened\r\non the spoil of Lombardy. It seems impossible to avoid the conclusion\r\nthat this indulgence towards the soldiers and severity towards\r\ncivilians was the result of a fixed determination to link indissolubly\r\nto his fortunes the generals and rank and file. The contrast in his\r\nbehaviour was often startling. Some of the civilians he imprisoned:\r\nothers he desired to shoot; but as the hardiest robbers had generally\r\nmade to themselves friends of the military mammon of unrighteousness,\r\nthey escaped with a fine ridiculously out of proportion to their\r\nactual gains.[51]\r\n\r\nThe Dukes of Parma and Modena were also mulcted. The former of these,\r\nowing to his relationship with the Spanish Bourbons, with whom the\r\nDirectory desired to remain on friendly terms, was subjected to the\r\nfine of merely two million francs and twenty masterpieces of art,\r\nthese last to be selected by French commissioners from the galleries\r\nof the duchy; but the Duke of Modena, who had assisted the Austrian\r\narms, purchased his pardon by an indemnity of ten million francs, and\r\nby the cession of twenty pictures, the chief artistic treasures of his\r\nStates.[52] As Bonaparte naïvely stated to the Directors, the duke had\r\nno fortresses or guns; consequently these could not be demanded from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFrom this degrading work Bonaparte strove to wean his soldiers by\r\nrecalling them to their nobler work of carrying on the enfranchisement\r\nof Italy. In a proclamation (May 20th) which even now stirs the blood\r\nlike a trumpet call, he bade his soldiers remember that, though much\r\nhad been done, a far greater task yet awaited them. Posterity must not\r\nreproach them for having found their Capua in Lombardy. Rome was to be\r\nfreed: the Eternal City was to renew her youth and show again the\r\nvirtues of her ancient worthies, Brutus and Scipio. Then France would\r\ngive a glorious peace to Europe; then their fellow-citizens would say\r\nof each champion of liberty as he returned to his hearth: \"He was of\r\nthe Army of Italy.\" By such stirring words did he entwine with the\r\nlove of liberty that passion for military glory which was destined to\r\nstrangle the Republic.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Austrians had retired behind the banks of the Mincio and\r\nthe walls of its guardian fortress, Mantua. Their position was one of\r\ngreat strength. The river, which carries off the surplus waters of\r\nLake Garda, joins the River Po after a course of some thirty miles.\r\nAlong with the tongue-like cavity occupied by its parent lake, the\r\nriver forms the chief inner barrier to all invaders of Italy. From\r\nthe earliest times down to those of the two Napoleons, the banks of\r\nthe Mincio have witnessed many of the contests which have decided the\r\nfortunes of the peninsula. On its lower course, where the river widens\r\nout into a semicircular lagoon flanked by marshes and backwaters, is\r\nthe historic town of Mantua. For this position, if we may trust the\r\npicturesque lines of Mantua's noblest son,[53] the three earliest\r\nraces of Northern Italy had striven; and when the power of imperial\r\nRome was waning, the fierce Attila pitched his camp on the banks of\r\nthe Mincio, and there received the pontiff Leo, whose prayers and\r\ndignity averted the threatening torrent of the Scythian horse.\r\n\r\nIt was by this stream, famed in war as in song, that the Imperialists\r\nnow halted their shattered forces, awaiting reinforcements from Tyrol.\r\nThese would pass down the valley of the Adige, and in the last part of\r\ntheir march would cross the lands of the Venetian Republic. For this\r\naction there was a long-established right of way, which did not\r\ninvolve a breach of the neutrality of Venice. But, as some of the\r\nAustrian troops had straggled on to the Venetian territory south of\r\nBrescia, the French commander had no hesitation in openly violating\r\nVenetian neutrality by the occupation of that town (May 26th).\r\nAugereau's division was also ordered to push on towards the west shore\r\nof Lake Garda, and there collect boats as if a crossing were intended.\r\nSeeing this, the Austrians seized the small Venetian fortress of\r\nPeschiera, which commands the exit of the Mincio from the lake, and\r\nVenetian neutrality was thenceforth wholly disregarded.\r\n\r\nBy adroit moves on the borders of the lake, Bonaparte now sought to\r\nmake Beaulieu nervous about his communications with Tyrol through the\r\nriver valley of the Adige; he completely succeeded: seeking to guard\r\nthe important positions on that river between Rivoli and Roveredo,\r\nBeaulieu so weakened his forces on the Mincio, that at Borghetto and\r\nValeggio he had only two battalions and ten squadrons of horse, or\r\nabout two thousand men. Lannes' grenadiers, therefore, had little\r\ndifficulty in forcing a passage on May 30th, whereupon Beaulieu\r\nwithdrew to the upper Adige, highly satisfied with himself for having\r\nvictualled the fortress of Mantua so that it could withstand a long\r\nsiege. This was, practically, his sole achievement in the campaign.\r\nOutnumbered, outgeneralled, bankrupt in health as in reputation, he\r\nsoon resigned his command, but not before he had given signs of\r\n\"downright dotage.\"[54] He had, however, achieved immortality: his\r\nincapacity threw into brilliant relief the genius of his young\r\nantagonist, and therefore appreciably affected the fortunes of Italy\r\nand of Europe.\r\n\r\nBonaparte now despatched Masséna's division northwards, to coop up the\r\nAustrians in the narrow valley of the upper Adige, while other\r\nregiments began to close in on Mantua. The peculiarities of the ground\r\nfavoured its investment. The semicircular lagoon which guards Mantua\r\non the north, and the marshes on the south side, render an assault\r\nvery difficult; but they also limit the range of ground over which\r\nsorties can be made, thereby lightening the work of the besiegers; and\r\nduring part of the blockade Napoleon left fewer than five thousand men\r\nfor this purpose. It was clear, however, that the reduction of Mantua\r\nwould be a tedious undertaking, such as Bonaparte's daring and\r\nenterprising genius could ill brook, and that his cherished design of\r\nmarching northwards to effect a junction with Moreau on the Danube was\r\nimpossible. Having only 40,400 men with him at midsummer, he had\r\nbarely enough to hold the line of the Adige, to blockade Mantua, and\r\nto keep open his communications with France.\r\n\r\nAt the command of the Directory he turned southward against feebler\r\nfoes. The relations between the Papal States and the French Republic\r\nhad been hostile since the assassination of the French envoy,\r\nBasseville, at Rome, in the early days of 1793; but the Pope, Pius\r\nVI., had confined himself to anathemas against the revolutionists and\r\nprayers for the success of the First Coalition.\r\n\r\nThis conduct now drew upon him a sharp blow. French troops crossed the\r\nPo and seized Bologna, whereupon the terrified cardinals signed an\r\narmistice with the republican commander, agreeing to close all their\r\nStates to the English, and to admit a French garrison to the port of\r\nAncona. The Pope also consented to yield up \"one hundred pictures,\r\nbusts, vases, or statues, as the French Commissioners shall determine,\r\namong which shall especially be included the bronze bust of Junius\r\nBrutus and the marble bust of Marcus Brutus, together with five\r\nhundred manuscripts.\" He was also constrained to pay 15,500,000\r\nfrancs, besides animals and goods such as the French agents should\r\nrequisition for their army, exclusive of the money and materials drawn\r\nfrom the districts of Bologna and Ferrara. The grand total, in money,\r\nand in kind, raised from the Papal States in this profitable raid, was\r\nreckoned by Bonaparte himself as 34,700,000 francs,[55] or about;\r\n£1,400,000--a liberal assessment for the life of a single envoy and\r\nthe _bruta fulmina_ of the Vatican.\r\n\r\nEqually lucrative was a dash into Tuscany. As the Grand Duke of this\r\nfertile land had allowed English cruisers and merchants certain\r\nprivileges at Leghorn, this was taken as a departure from the\r\nneutrality which he ostensibly maintained since the signature of a\r\ntreaty of peace with France in 1795. A column of the republicans now\r\nswiftly approached Leghorn and seized much valuable property from\r\nBritish merchants. Yet the invaders failed to secure the richest of\r\nthe hoped-for plunder; for about forty English merchantmen sheered off\r\nfrom shore as the troops neared the seaport, and an English frigate,\r\nswooping down, carried off two French vessels almost under the eyes of\r\nBonaparte himself. This last outrage gave, it is true, a slight\r\nexcuse for the levying of requisitions in Leghorn and its environs;\r\nyet, according to the memoir-writer, Miot de Melito, this unprincipled\r\naction must be attributed not to Bonaparte, but to the urgent needs of\r\nthe French treasury and the personal greed of some of the Directors.\r\nPossibly also the French commissioners and agents, who levied\r\nblackmail or selected pictures, may have had some share in the shaping\r\nof the Directorial policy: at least, it is certain that some of them,\r\nnotably Salicetti, amassed a large fortune from the plunder of\r\nLeghorn. In order to calm the resentment of the Grand Duke, Bonaparte\r\npaid a brief visit to Florence. He was received in respectful silence\r\nas he rode through the streets where his ancestors had schemed for the\r\nGhibelline cause. By a deft mingling of courtesy and firmness the new\r\nconqueror imposed his will on the Government of Florence, and then\r\nsped northward to press on the siege of Mantua.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE FIGHTS FOR MANTUA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which recalled Bonaparte to the banks of the Mincio\r\nwere indeed serious. The Emperor Francis was determined at all costs\r\nto retain his hold on Italy by raising the siege of that fortress; and\r\nunless the French commander could speedily compass its fall, he had\r\nthe prospect of fighting a greatly superior army while his rear was\r\nthreatened by the garrison of Mantua. Austria was making unparalleled\r\nefforts to drive this presumptuous young general from a land which she\r\nregarded as her own political preserve. Military historians have\r\nalways been puzzled to account for her persistent efforts in 1796-7 to\r\nre-conquer Lombardy. But, in truth, the reasons are diplomatic, not\r\nmilitary, and need not be detailed here. Suffice it to say that,\r\nthough the Hapsburg lands in Swabia were threatened by Moreau's Army\r\nof the Rhine, Francis determined at all costs to recover his Italian\r\npossessions.\r\n\r\nTo this end the Emperor now replaced the luckless Beaulieu by General\r\nWürmser, who had gained some reputation in the Rhenish campaigns; and,\r\ndetaching 25,000 men from his northern armies to strengthen his army\r\non the Adige, he bade him carry the double-headed eagle of Austria\r\nvictoriously into the plains of Italy. Though too late to relieve the\r\ncitadel of Milan, he was to strain every nerve to relieve Mantua; and,\r\nsince the latest reports represented the French as widely dispersed\r\nfor the plunder of Central Italy, the Emperor indulged the highest\r\nhopes of Würmser's success.[56]\r\n\r\nPossibly this might have been attained had the Austrian Emperor and\r\nstaff understood the absolute need of concentration in attacking a\r\ncommander who had already demonstrated its supreme importance in\r\nwarfare. Yet the difficulties of marching an army of 47,000 men\r\nthrough the narrow defile carved by the Adige through the Tyrolese\r\nAlps, and the wide extent of the French covering lines, led to the\r\nadoption of a plan which favoured rapidity at the expense of security.\r\nWürmser was to divide his forces for the difficult march southward\r\nfrom Tyrol into Italy. In defence of this arrangement much could be\r\nurged. To have cumbered the two roads, which run on either side of the\r\nAdige from Trient towards Mantua, with infantry, cavalry, artillery,\r\nand the countless camp-followers, animals, and wagons that follow an\r\narmy, would have been fatal alike to speed of marching and to success\r\nin mountain warfare. Even in the campaign of 1866 the greatest\r\ncommander of this generation carried out his maxim, \"March in separate\r\ncolumns: unite for fighting.\" But Würmser and the Aulic Council[57] at\r\nVienna neglected to insure that reunion for attack, on which von\r\nMoltke laid such stress in his Bohemian campaign. The Austrian forces\r\nin 1796 were divided by obstacles which could not quickly be crossed,\r\nnamely, by Lake Garda and the lofty mountains which tower above the\r\nvalley of the Adige. Assuredly the Imperialists were not nearly strong\r\nenough to run any risks. The official Austrian returns show that the\r\ntotal force assembled in Tyrol for the invasion of Italy amounted to\r\n46,937 men, not to the 60,000 as pictured by the imagination of Thiers\r\nand other French historians. As Bonaparte had in Lombardy-Venetia\r\nfully 45,000 men (including 10,000 now engaged in the siege of\r\nMantua), scattered along a front of fifty miles from Milan to Brescia\r\nand Legnago, the incursion of Würmser's force, if the French were held\r\nto their separate positions by diversions against their flanks, must\r\nhave proved decisive. But the fault was committed of so far dividing\r\nthe Austrians that nowhere could they deal a crushing blow.\r\nQuosdanovich with 17,600 men was to take the western side of Lake\r\nGarda, seize the French magazines at Brescia, and cut their\r\ncommunications with Milan and France: the main body under Würmser,\r\n24,300 strong, was meanwhile to march in two columns on either bank of\r\nthe Adige, drive the French from Rivoli and push on towards Mantua:\r\nand yet a third division, led by Davidovich from the district of\r\nFriuli on the east, received orders to march on Vicenza and Legnago,\r\nin order to distract the French from that side, and possibly relieve\r\nMantua if the other two onsets failed.\r\n\r\nFaulty as these dispositions were, they yet seriously disconcerted\r\nBonaparte. He was at Montechiaro, a village situated on the road\r\nbetween Brescia and Mantua, when, on July 29th, he heard that the\r\nwhite-coats had driven in Masséna's vanguard above Rivoli on the\r\nAdige, were menacing other positions near Verona and Legnago, and were\r\nadvancing on Brescia. As soon as the full extent of the peril was\r\nmanifest, he sent off ten despatches to his generals, ordering a\r\nconcentration of troops--these, of course, fighting so as to delay the\r\npursuit--towards the southern end of Lake Garda. This wise step\r\nprobably saved his isolated forces from disaster. It was at that point\r\nthat the Austrians proposed to unite their two chief columns and crush\r\nthe French detachments. But, by drawing in the divisions of Masséna\r\nand Augereau towards the Mincio, Bonaparte speedily assembled a\r\nformidable array, and held the central position between the eastern\r\nand western divisions of the Imperialists. He gave up the important\r\ndefensive line of the Adige, it is true; but by promptly rallying on\r\nthe Mincio, he occupied a base that was defended on the north by the\r\nsmall fortress of Peschiera and the waters of Lake Garda. Holding the\r\nbridges over the Mincio, he could strike at his assailants wherever\r\nthey should attack; above all, he still covered the siege of Mantua.\r\nSuch were his dispositions on July 29th and 30th. On the latter day he\r\nheard of the loss of Brescia, and the consequent cutting of his\r\ncommunications with Milan. Thereupon he promptly ordered Sérurier, who\r\nwas besieging Mantua, to make a last vigorous effort to take that\r\nfortress, but also to assure his retreat westwards if fortune failed\r\nhim. Later in the day he ordered him forthwith to send away his\r\nsiege-train, throwing into the lake or burying whatever he could not\r\nsave from the advancing Imperialists.\r\n\r\nThis apparently desperate step, which seemed to forebode the\r\nabandonment not only of the siege of Mantua, but of the whole of\r\nLombardy, was in reality a masterstroke. Bonaparte had perceived the\r\ntruth, which the campaigns of 1813 and 1870 were abundantly to\r\nillustrate--that the possession of fortresses, and consequently their\r\nsiege by an invader, is of secondary importance when compared with a\r\ndecisive victory gained in the open. When menaced by superior forces\r\nadvancing towards the south of Lake Garda, he saw that he must\r\nsacrifice his siege works, even his siege-train, in order to gain for\r\na few precious days that superiority in the field which the division\r\nof the Imperialist columns still left to him.\r\n\r\nThe dates of these occurrences deserve close scrutiny; for they\r\nsuffice to refute some of the exorbitant claims made at a later time\r\nby General Augereau, that only his immovable firmness forced Bonaparte\r\nto fight and to change his dispositions of retreat into an attack\r\nwhich re-established everything. This extraordinary assertion,\r\npublished by Augereau after he had deserted Napoleon in 1814, is\r\naccompanied by a detailed recital of the events of July 30th-August\r\n5th, in which Bonaparte appears as the dazed and discouraged\r\ncommander, surrounded by pusillanimous generals, and urged on to fight\r\nsolely by the confidence of Augereau. That the forceful energy of this\r\ngeneral had a great influence in restoring the _morale_ of the French\r\narmy in the confused and desperate movements which followed may freely\r\nbe granted. But his claims to have been the main spring of the French\r\nmovements in those anxious days deserve a brief examination. He\r\nasserts that Bonaparte, \"devoured by anxieties,\" met him at Roverbella\r\nlate in the evening of July 30th, and spoke of retiring beyond the\r\nRiver Po. The official correspondence disproves this assertion.\r\nBonaparte had already given orders to Sérurier to retire beyond the Po\r\nwith his artillery train; but this was obviously an attempt to save it\r\nfrom the advancing Austrians; and the commander had ordered the\r\nnorthern part of the French besieging force to join Augereau between\r\nRoverbella and Goito. Augereau further asserts that, after he had\r\nroused Bonaparte to the need of a dash to recover Brescia, the\r\ncommander-in-chief remarked to Berthier, \"In that case we must raise\r\nthe siege of Mantua,\" which again he (Augereau) vigorously opposed.\r\nThis second statement is creditable neither to Augereau's accuracy nor\r\nto his sagacity. The order for the raising of the siege had been\r\nissued, and it was entirely necessary for the concentration of French\r\ntroops, on which Bonaparte now relied as his only hope against\r\nsuperior force. Had Bonaparte listened to Augereau's advice and\r\npersisted still in besieging Mantua, the scattered French forces must\r\nhave been crushed in detail. Augereau's words are those of a mere\r\nfighter, not of a strategist; and the timidity which he ungenerously\r\nattributed to Bonaparte was nothing but the caution which a superior\r\nintellect saw to be a necessary prelude to a victorious move.\r\n\r\nThat the fighting honours of the ensuing days rightly belong to\r\nAugereau may be frankly conceded. With forces augmented by the\r\nnorthern part of the besiegers of Mantua, he moved rapidly westwards\r\nfrom the Mincio against Brescia, and rescued it from the vanguard of\r\nQuosdanovich (August 1st). On the previous day other Austrian\r\ndetachments had also, after obstinate conflicts, been worsted near\r\nSalo and Lonato. Still, the position was one of great perplexity: for\r\nthough Masséna's division from the Adige was now beginning to come\r\ninto touch with Bonaparte's chief force, yet the fronts of Würmser's\r\ncolumns were menacing the French from that side, while the troops of\r\nQuosdanovich, hovering about Lonato and Salo, struggled desperately to\r\nstretch a guiding hand to their comrades on the Mincio.\r\n\r\nWürmser was now discovering his error. Lured towards Mantua by false\r\nreports that the French were still covering the siege, he had marched\r\ndue south when he ought to have rushed to the rescue of his\r\nhard-pressed lieutenant at Brescia. Entering Mantua, he enjoyed a\r\nbrief spell of triumph, and sent to the Emperor Francis the news of\r\nthe capture of 40 French cannon in the trenches, and of 139 more on\r\nthe banks of the Po. But, while he was indulging the fond hope that\r\nthe French were in full retreat from Italy, came the startling news\r\nthat they had checked Quosdanovich at Brescia and Salo. Realizing his\r\nerrors, and determining to retrieve them before all was lost, he at\r\nonce pushed on his vanguard towards Castiglione, and easily gained\r\nthat village and its castle from a French detachment commanded by\r\nGeneral Valette.\r\n\r\nThe feeble defence of so important a position threw Bonaparte into one\r\nof those transports of fury which occasionally dethroned his better\r\njudgment. Meeting Valette at Montechiaro, he promptly degraded him to\r\nthe ranks, refusing to listen to his plea of having received a written\r\norder to retire. A report of General Landrieux asserts that the rage\r\nof the commander-in-chief was so extreme as for the time even to\r\nimpair his determination. The outlook was gloomy. The French seemed\r\nabout to be hemmed in amidst the broken country between Castiglione,\r\nBrescia, and Salo. A sudden attack on the Austrians was obviously the\r\nonly safe and honourable course. But no one knew precisely their\r\nnumbers or their position. Uncertainty ever preyed on Bonaparte's\r\nardent imagination. His was a mind that quailed not before visible\r\ndangers; but, with all its powers of decisive action, it retained so\r\nmuch of Corsican eeriness as to chafe at the unknown,[58] and to lose\r\nfor the moment the faculty of forming a vigorous resolution. Like the\r\npython, which grips its native rock by the tail in order to gain its\r\nfull constricting power, so Bonaparte ever needed a groundwork of fact\r\nfor the due exercise of his mental force.\r\n\r\nOne of a group of generals, whom he had assembled about him near\r\nMontechiaro, proposed that they should ascend the hill which dominated\r\nthe plain. Even from its ridge no Austrians were to be seen. Again the\r\ncommander burst forth with petulant reproaches, and even talked of\r\nretiring to the Adda. Whereupon, if we may trust the \"Memoirs\" of\r\nGeneral Landrieux, Augereau protested against retreat, and promised\r\nsuccess for a vigorous charge. \"I wash my hands of it, and I am going\r\naway,\" replied Bonaparte. \"And who will command, if you go?\" inquired\r\nAugereau. \"You,\" retorted Bonaparte, as he left the astonished circle.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the first attack on Castiglione was certainly\r\nleft to this determined fighter; and the mingling of boldness and\r\nguile which he showed on the following day regained for the French not\r\nonly the village, but also the castle, perched on a precipitous rock.\r\nYet the report of Colonel Graham, who was then at Marshal Würmser's\r\nheadquarters, somewhat dulls the lustre of Augereau's exploit; for the\r\nBritish officer asserts that the Austrian position had been taken up\r\nquite by haphazard, and that fewer than 15,000 white-coats were\r\nengaged in this first battle of Castiglione. Furthermore, the\r\nnarratives of this _mêlée_ written by Augereau himself and by two\r\nother generals, Landrieux and Verdier, who were disaffected towards\r\nBonaparte, must naturally be received with much reserve. The effect of\r\nAugereau's indomitable energy in restoring confidence to the soldiers\r\nand victory to the French tricolour was, however, generously admitted\r\nby the Emperor Napoleon; for, at a later time when complaints were\r\nbeing made about Augereau, he generously exclaimed: \"Ah, let us not\r\nforget that he saved us at Castiglione.\"[59]\r\n\r\nWhile Augereau was recovering this important position, confused\r\nconflicts were raging a few miles further north at Lonato. Masséna at\r\nfirst was driven back by the onset of the Imperialists; but while they\r\nwere endeavouring to envelop the French, Bonaparte arrived, and in\r\nconjunction with Masséna pushed on a central attack such as often\r\nwrested victory from the enemy. The white-coats retired in disorder,\r\nsome towards Gavardo, others towards the lake, hotly followed by the\r\nFrench. In the pursuit towards Gavardo, Bonaparte's old friend,\r\nJunot, distinguished himself by his dashing valour. He wounded a\r\ncolonel, slew six troopers, and, covered with wounds, was finally\r\noverthrown into a ditch. Such is Bonaparte's own account. It is\r\ngratifying to know that the wounds neither singly nor collectively\r\nwere dangerous, and did not long repress Junot's activity. A tinge of\r\nromance seems, indeed, to have gilded many of these narratives; and a\r\ncritical examination of the whole story of Lonato seems to suggest\r\ndoubts whether the victory was as decisive as historians have often\r\nrepresented. If the Austrians were \"thrown back on Lake Garda and\r\nDesenzano,\"[60] it is difficult to see why the pursuers did not drive\r\nthem into the lake. As a matter of fact, nearly all the beaten troops\r\nescaped to Gavardo, while others joined their comrades engaged in the\r\nblockade of Peschiera.\r\n\r\nA strange incident serves to illustrate the hazards of war and the\r\nconfusion of this part of the campaign. A detachment of the vanquished\r\nAustrian forces some 4,000 strong, unable to join their comrades at\r\nGavardo or Peschiera, and yet unharmed by the victorious pursuers,\r\nwandered about on the hills, and on the next day chanced near Lonato\r\nto come upon a much smaller detachment of French. Though unaware of\r\nthe full extent of their good fortune, the Imperialists boldly sent an\r\nenvoy to summon the French commanding officer to surrender. When the\r\nbandage was taken from his eyes, he was abashed to find himself in the\r\npresence of Bonaparte, surrounded by the generals of his staff. The\r\nyoung commander's eyes flashed fire at the seeming insult, and in\r\ntones vibrating with well-simulated passion he threatened the envoy\r\nwith condign punishment for daring to give such a message to the\r\ncommander-in-chief at his headquarters in the midst of his army. Let\r\nhim and his men forthwith lay down their arms. Dazed by the demand,\r\nand seeing only the victorious chief and not the smallness of his\r\ndetachment, 4,000 Austrians surrendered to 1,200 French, or rather to\r\nthe address and audacity of one master-mind.\r\n\r\nElated by this augury of further victory, the republicans prepared for\r\nthe decisive blow. Würmser, though checked on August 3rd, had been so\r\nfar reinforced from Mantua as still to indulge hopes of driving the\r\nFrench from Castiglione and cutting his way through to rescue\r\nQuosdanovich. He was, indeed, in honour bound to make the attempt; for\r\nthe engagement had been made, with the usual futility that dogged the\r\nAustrian councils, to reunite their forces and _fight the French on\r\nthe 7th of August_. These cast-iron plans were now adhered to in spite\r\nof their dislocation at the hands of Bonaparte and Augereau. Würmser's\r\nline stretched from near the village of Médole in a north-easterly\r\ndirection across the high-road between Brescia and Mantua; while his\r\nright wing was posted in the hilly country around Solferino. In fact,\r\nhis extreme right rested on the tower-crowned heights of Solferino,\r\nwhere the forces of Austria two generations later maintained so\r\ndesperate a defence against the onset of Napoleon III. and his\r\nliberating army.\r\n\r\nOwing to the non-arrival of Mezaros' corps marching from Legnago,\r\nWürmser mustered scarcely twenty-five thousand men on his long line;\r\nwhile the very opportune approach of part of Sérurier's division,\r\nunder the lead of Fiorella, from the south, gave the French an\r\nadvantage even in numbers. Moreover, Fiorella's advance on the south\r\nof Würmser's weaker flank, that near Médole, threatened to turn it and\r\nendanger the Austrian communications with Mantua. The Imperialists\r\nseem to have been unaware of this danger; and their bad scouting here\r\nas elsewhere was largely responsible for the issue of the day.\r\nWürmser's desire to stretch a helping hand to Quosdanovich near Lonato\r\nand his confidence in the strength of his own right wing betrayed him\r\ninto a fatal imprudence. Sending out feelers after his hard-pressed\r\ncolleague on the north, he dangerously prolonged his line, an error in\r\nwhich he was deftly encouraged by Bonaparte, who held back his own\r\nleft wing. Meanwhile the French were rolling in the other extremity of\r\nthe Austrian line. Marmont, dashing forward with the horse artillery,\r\ntook the enemy's left wing in flank and silenced many of their pieces.\r\nUnder cover of this attack, Fiorella's division was able to creep up\r\nwithin striking distance; and the French cavalry, swooping round the\r\nrear of this hard-pressed wing, nearly captured Würmser and his staff.\r\nA vigorous counterattack by the Austrian reserves, or an immediate\r\nwheeling round of the whole line, was needed to repulse this brilliant\r\nflank attack; but the Austrian reserves had been expended in the north\r\nof their line; and an attempt to change front, always a difficult\r\noperation, was crushed by a headlong charge of Masséna's and\r\nAugereau's divisions on their centre. Before these attacks the whole\r\nAustrian line gave way; and, according to Colonel Graham, nothing but\r\nthis retreat, undertaken \"without orders,\" saved the whole force from\r\nbeing cut off. The criticisms of our officer sufficiently reveal the\r\ncause of the disaster. The softness and incapacity of Würmser, the\r\nabsence of a responsible second in command, the ignorance of the\r\nnumber and positions of the French, the determination to advance\r\ntowards Castiglione and to wait thereabouts for Quosdanovich until a\r\nbattle could be fought with combined forces on the 7th, the taking up\r\na position almost by haphazard on the Castiglione-Médole line, and the\r\nfailure to detect Fiorella's approach, present a series of defects and\r\nblunders which might have given away the victory to a third-rate\r\nopponent.[61]\r\n\r\nThe battle was by no means sanguinary: it was a series of manoeuvres\r\nrather than of prolonged conflicts. Hence its interest to all who by\r\npreference dwell on the intellectual problems of warfare rather than\r\non the details of fighting. Bonaparte had previously shown that he\r\ncould deal blows with telling effect. The ease and grace of his moves\r\nat the second battle of Castiglione now redeemed the reputation which\r\nhis uncertain behaviour on the four preceding days had somewhat\r\ncompromised.\r\n\r\nA complete and authentic account of this week of confused fighting has\r\nnever been written. The archives of Vienna have not as yet yielded up\r\nall their secrets; and the reputations of so many French officers were\r\nover-clouded by this prolonged _mêlée_ as to render even the victors'\r\naccounts vague and inconsistent. The aim of historians everywhere to\r\ngive a clear and vivid account, and the desire of Napoleonic\r\nenthusiasts to represent their hero as always thinking clearly and\r\nacting decisively, have fused trusty ores and worthless slag into an\r\nalloy which has passed for true metal. But no student of Napoleon's\r\n\"Correspondence,\" of the \"Memoirs\" of Marmont, and of the recitals of\r\nAugereau, Dumas, Landrieux, Verdier, Despinois and others, can hope\r\nwholly to unravel the complications arising from the almost continuous\r\nconflicts that extended over a dozen leagues of hilly country. War is\r\nnot always dramatic, however much the readers of campaigns may yearn\r\nafter thrilling narratives. In regard to this third act of the Italian\r\ncampaign, all that can safely be said is that Bonaparte's intuition to\r\nraise the siege of Mantua, in order that he might defeat in detail the\r\nrelieving armies, bears the imprint of genius: but the execution of\r\nthis difficult movement was unequal, even at times halting; and the\r\nFrench army was rescued from its difficulties only by the grand\r\nfighting qualities of the rank and file, and by the Austrian blunders,\r\nwhich outnumbered those of the republican generals.\r\n\r\nNeither were the results of the Castiglione cycle of battles quite so\r\nbrilliant as have been represented. Würmser and Quosdanovich lost in\r\nall 17,000 men, it is true: but the former had re-garrisoned and\r\nre-victualled Mantua, besides capturing all the French siege-train.\r\nBonaparte's primary aim had been to reduce Mantua, so that he might be\r\nfree to sweep through Tyrol, join hands with Moreau, and overpower the\r\nwhite-coats in Bavaria. The aim of the Aulic Council and Würmser had\r\nbeen to relieve Mantua and restore the Hapsburg rule over Lombardy.\r\nNeither side had succeeded. But the Austrians could at least point to\r\nsome successes; and, above all, Mantua was in a better state of\r\ndefence than when the French first approached its walls: and while\r\nMantua was intact, Bonaparte was held to the valley of the Mincio, and\r\ncould not deal those lightning blows on the Inn and the Danube which\r\nhe ever regarded as the climax of the campaign. Viewed on its material\r\nside, his position was no better than it was before Würmser's\r\nincursion into the plains of Venetia.[62]\r\n\r\nWith true Hapsburg tenacity, Francis determined on further efforts for\r\nthe relief of Mantua. Apart from the promptings of dynastic pride, his\r\nreasons for thus obstinately struggling against Alpine gorges, Italian\r\nsentiment, and Bonaparte's genius, are wellnigh inscrutable; and\r\nmilitary writers have generally condemned this waste of resources on\r\nthe Brenta, which, if hurled against the French on the Rhine, would\r\nhave compelled the withdrawal of Bonaparte from Italy for the defence\r\nof Lorraine. But the pride of the Emperor Francis brooked no surrender\r\nof his Italian possessions, and again Würmser was spurred on from\r\nVienna to another invasion of Venetia. It would be tedious to give an\r\naccount of Würmser's second attempt, which belongs rather to the\r\ndomain of political fatuity than that of military history. Colonel\r\nGraham states that the Austrian rank and file laughed at their\r\ngenerals, and bitterly complained that they were being led to the\r\nshambles, while the officers almost openly exclaimed: \"We must make\r\npeace, for we don't know how to make war.\" This was again apparent.\r\nBonaparte forestalled their attack. Their divided forces fell an easy\r\nprey to Masséna, who at Bassano cut Würmser's force to pieces and sent\r\nthe _débris_ flying down the valley of the Brenta. Losing most of\r\ntheir artillery, and separated in two chief bands, the Imperialists\r\nseemed doomed to surrender: but Würmser, doubling on his pursuers,\r\nmade a dash westwards, finally cutting his way to Mantua. There again\r\nhe vainly endeavoured to make a stand. He was driven from his\r\npositions in front of St. Georges and La Favorita, and was shut up in\r\nthe town itself. This addition to the numbers of the garrison was no\r\nincrease to its strength; for the fortress, though well provisioned\r\nfor an ordinary garrison, could not support a prolonged blockade, and\r\nthe fevers of the early autumn soon began to decimate troops worn out\r\nby forced marches and unable to endure the miasma ascending from the\r\nmarshes of the Mincio.\r\n\r\nThe French also were wearied by their exertions in the fierce heats of\r\nSeptember. Murmurs were heard in the ranks and at the mess tables that\r\nBonaparte's reports of these exploits were tinged by favouritism\r\nand by undue severity against those whose fortune had been less\r\nconspicuous than their merits. One of these misunderstandings was of\r\nsome importance. Masséna, whose services had been brilliant at Bassano\r\nbut less felicitous since the crossing of the Adige, reproached\r\nBonaparte for denying praise to the most deserving and lavishing it on\r\nmen who had come in opportunely to reap the labours of others. His\r\nwritten protest, urged with the old republican frankness, only served\r\nfurther to cloud over the relations between them, which, since Lonato,\r\nhad not been cordial.[63] Even thus early in his career Bonaparte\r\ngained the reputation of desiring brilliant and entire success, and of\r\nvisiting with his displeasure men who, from whatever cause, did not\r\nwrest from Fortune her utmost favours. That was his own mental\r\nattitude towards the fickle goddess. After entering Milan he cynically\r\nremarked to Marmont: \"Fortune is a woman; and the more she does for\r\nme, the more I will require of her.\" Suggestive words, which explain\r\nat once the splendour of his rise and the rapidity of his fall.\r\n\r\nDuring the few weeks of comparative inaction which ensued, the affairs\r\nof Italy claimed his attention. The prospect of an Austrian\r\nre-conquest had caused no less concern to the friends of liberty in\r\nthe peninsula than joy to the reactionary coteries of the old\r\nsovereigns. At Rome and Naples threats against the French were\r\nwhispered or openly vaunted. The signature of the treaties of peace\r\nwas delayed, and the fulminations of the Vatican were prepared against\r\nthe sacrilegious spoilers. After the Austrian war-cloud had melted\r\naway, the time had come to punish prophets of evil. The Duke of Modena\r\nwas charged with allowing a convoy to pass from his State to the\r\ngarrison of Mantua, and with neglecting to pay the utterly impossible\r\nfine to which Bonaparte had condemned him. The men of Reggio and\r\nModena were also encouraged to throw off his yoke and to confide in\r\nthe French. Those of Reggio succeeded; but in the city of Modena\r\nitself the ducal troops repressed the rising. Bonaparte accordingly\r\nasked the advice of the Directory; but his resolution was already\r\nformed. Two days after seeking their counsel, he took the decisive\r\nstep of declaring Modena and Reggio to be under the protection of\r\nFrance. This act formed an exceedingly important departure in the\r\nhistory of France as well as in that of Italy. Hitherto the Directory\r\nhad succeeded in keeping Bonaparte from active intervention in affairs\r\nof high policy. In particular, it had enjoined on him the greatest\r\nprudence with regard to the liberated lands of Italy, so as not to\r\ninvolve France in prolonged intervention in the peninsula, or commit\r\nher to a war _à outrance_ with the Hapsburgs; and its warnings were\r\nnow urged with all the greater emphasis because news had recently\r\nreached Paris of a serious disaster to the French arms in Germany. But\r\nwhile the Directors counselled prudence, Bonaparte forced their hand\r\nby declaring the Duchy of Modena to be under the protection of France;\r\nand when their discreet missive reached him, he expressed to them his\r\nregret that it had come too late. By that time (October 24th) he had\r\nvirtually founded a new State, for whose security French honour was\r\ndeeply pledged. This implied the continuance of the French occupation\r\nof Northern Italy and therefore a prolongation of Bonaparte's command.\r\n\r\nIt was not the Duchy of Modena alone which felt the invigorating\r\ninfluence of democracy and nationality. The Papal cities of Bologna\r\nand Ferrara had broken away from the Papal sway, and now sent deputies\r\nto meet the champions of liberty at Modena and found a free\r\ncommonwealth. There amidst great enthusiasm was held the first truly\r\nrepresentative Italian assembly that had met for many generations; and\r\na levy of 2,800 volunteers, styled the Italian legion, was decreed.\r\nBonaparte visited these towns, stimulated their energy, and bade the\r\nturbulent beware of his vengeance, which would be like that of \"the\r\nexterminating angel.\" In a brief space these districts were formed\r\ninto the Cispadane Republic, destined soon to be merged into a yet\r\nlarger creation. A new life breathed from Modena and Bologna into\r\nCentral Italy. The young republic forthwith abolished all feudal laws,\r\ndecreed civic equality, and ordered the convocation at Bologna of a\r\npopularly elected Assembly for the Christmas following. These events\r\nmark the first stage in the beginning of that grand movement, _Il\r\nRisorgimento,_ which after long delays was finally consummated in\r\n1870.\r\n\r\nThis period of Bonaparte's career may well be lingered over by those\r\nwho value his invigorating influence on Italian life more highly than\r\nhis military triumphs. At this epoch he was still the champion of the\r\nbest principles of the Revolution; he had overthrown Austrian\r\ndomination in the peninsula, and had shaken to their base domestic\r\ntyrannies worse than that of the Hapsburgs. His triumphs were as yet\r\nuntarnished. If we except the plundering of the liberated and\r\nconquered lands, an act for which the Directory was primarily\r\nresponsible, nothing was at this time lacking to the full orb of his\r\nglory. An envoy bore him the welcome news that the English, wearied by\r\nthe intractable Corsicans, had evacuated the island of his birth; and\r\nhe forthwith arranged for the return of many of the exiles who had\r\nbeen faithful to the French Republic. Among these was Salicetti, who\r\nnow returned for a time to his old insular sphere; while his former\r\n_protégé_ was winning a world-wide fame. Then, turning to the affairs\r\nof Central Italy, the young commander showed his diplomatic talents to\r\nbe not a whit inferior to his genius for war. One instance of this\r\nmust here suffice. He besought the Pope, who had broken off the\r\nlingering negotiations with France, not to bring on his people the\r\nhorrors of war.[64] The beauty of this appeal, as also of a somewhat\r\nearlier appeal to the Emperor Francis at Vienna, is, however,\r\nconsiderably marred by other items which now stand revealed in\r\nBonaparte's instructive correspondence. After hearing of the French\r\ndefeats in Germany, he knew that the Directors could spare him very\r\nfew of the 25,000 troops whom he demanded as reinforcements.\r\n\r\nHe was also aware that the Pope, incensed at his recent losses in\r\nmoney and lands, was seeking to revivify the First Coalition. The\r\npacific precepts addressed by the young Corsican to the Papacy must\r\ntherefore be viewed in the light of merely mundane events and of his\r\nsecret advice to the French agent at Rome: \"The great thing is to gain\r\ntime.... Finally, the game really is for us to throw the ball from one\r\nto the other, so as to deceive this old fox.\"[65]\r\n\r\nFrom these diplomatic amenities the general was forced to turn to the\r\nhazards of war. Gauging Bonaparte's missive at its true worth, the\r\nEmperor determined to re-conquer Italy, an enterprise that seemed well\r\nwithin his powers. In the month of October victory had crowned the\r\nefforts of his troops in Germany. At Würzburg the Archduke Charles had\r\ncompletely beaten Jourdan, and had thrown both his army and that of\r\nMoreau back on the Rhine. Animated by reviving hopes, the Imperialists\r\nnow assembled some 60,000 strong. Alvintzy, a veteran of sixty years,\r\nrenowned for his bravery, but possessing little strategic ability, was\r\nin command of some 35,000 men in the district of Friuli, north of\r\nTrieste, covering that seaport from a threatened French attack. With\r\nthis large force he was to advance due west, towards the River Brenta,\r\nwhile Davidovich, marching through Tyrol by the valley of the Adige,\r\nwas to meet him with the remainder near Verona. As Jomini has\r\nobserved, the Austrians gave themselves infinite trouble and\r\nencountered grave risks in order to compass a junction of forces\r\nwhich they might quietly have effected at the outset. Despite all\r\nBonaparte's lessons, the Aulic Council still clung to its old plan of\r\nenveloping the foe and seeking to bewilder them by attacks delivered\r\nfrom different sides. Possibly also they were emboldened by the\r\ncomparative smallness of Bonaparte's numbers to repeat this hazardous\r\nmanoeuvre.\r\n\r\nThe French could muster little more than 40,000 men; and of these at\r\nleast 8,000 were needed opposite Mantua.\r\n\r\nAt first the Imperialists gained important successes; for though the\r\nFrench held their own on the Brenta, yet their forces in the Tyrol\r\nwere driven down the valley of the Adige with losses so considerable\r\nthat Bonaparte was constrained to order a general retreat on Verona.\r\nHe discerned that from this central position he could hold in check\r\nAlvintzy's troops marching westwards from Vicenza and prevent their\r\njunction with the Imperialists under Davidovich, who were striving to\r\nthrust Vaubois' division from the plateau of Rivoli.\r\n\r\nBut before offering battle to Alvintzy outside Verona, Bonaparte paid\r\na flying visit to his men posted on that plateau in order to rebuke\r\nthe wavering and animate the whole body with his own dauntless spirit.\r\nForming the troops around him, he addressed two regiments in tones of\r\ngrief and anger. He reproached them for abandoning strong positions in\r\na panic, and ordered his chief staff officer to inscribe on their\r\ncolours the ominous words: \"They are no longer of the Army of\r\nItaly.\"[66] Stung by this reproach, the men begged with sobs that the\r\ngeneral would test their valour before disgracing them for ever. The\r\nyoung commander, who must have counted on such a result to his words,\r\nwhen uttered to French soldiers, thereupon promised to listen to their\r\nappeals; and their bravery in the ensuing fights wiped every stain of\r\ndisgrace from their colours. By such acts as these did he nerve his\r\nmen against superior numbers and adverse fortune.\r\n\r\nTheir fortitude was to be severely tried at all points. Alvintzy\r\noccupied a strong position on a line of hills at Caldiero, a few miles\r\nto the east of Verona. His right wing was protected by the spurs of\r\nthe Tyrolese Alps, while his left was flanked by the marshes which\r\nstretch between the rivers Alpon and Adige; and he protected his front\r\nby cannon skilfully ranged along the hills. All the bravery of\r\nMasséna's troops failed to dislodge the right wing of the\r\nImperialists. The French centre was torn by the Austrian cannon and\r\nmusketry. A pitiless storm of rain and sleet hindered the advance of\r\nthe French guns and unsteadied the aim of the gunners; and finally\r\nthey withdrew into Verona, leaving behind 2,000 killed and wounded,\r\nand 750 prisoners (November 12th). This defeat at Caldiero--for it is\r\nidle to speak of it merely as a check--opened up a gloomy vista of\r\ndisasters for the French; and Bonaparte, though he disguised his fears\r\nbefore his staff and the soldiery, forthwith wrote to the Directors\r\nthat the army felt itself abandoned at the further end of Italy, and\r\nthat this fair conquest seemed about to be lost. With his usual device\r\nof under-rating his own forces and exaggerating those of his foes, he\r\nstated that the French both at Verona and Rivoli were only 18,000,\r\nwhile the grand total of the Imperialists was upwards of 50,000. But\r\nhe must have known that for the present he had to deal with rather\r\nless than half that number. The greater part of the Tyrolese force\r\nhad not as yet descended the Adige below Roveredo; and allowing for\r\ndetachments and losses, Alvintzy's array at Caldiero barely exceeded\r\n20,000 effectives.\r\n\r\nBonaparte now determined to hazard one of the most daring turning\r\nmovements which history records. It was necessary at all costs to\r\ndrive Alvintzy from the heights of Caldiero before the Tyrolese\r\ncolumns should overpower Vaubois' detachment at Rivoli and debouch in\r\nthe plains west of Verona. But, as Caldiero could not be taken by a\r\nfront attack, it must be turned by a flanking movement. To any other\r\ngeneral than Bonaparte this would have appeared hopeless; but where\r\nothers saw nothing but difficulties, his eye discerned a means of\r\nsafety. South and south-east of those hills lies a vast depression\r\nswamped by the flood waters of the Alpon and the Adige. Morasses\r\nstretch for some miles west of the village of Arcola, through which\r\nruns a road up the eastern bank of the Alpon, crossing that stream at\r\nthe aforenamed village and leading to the banks of the Adige opposite\r\nthe village of Ronco; another causeway, diverging from the former a\r\nlittle to the north of Ronco, leads in a north-westerly direction\r\ntowards Porcil. By advancing from Ronco along these causeways, and by\r\nseizing Arcola, Bonaparte designed to outflank the Austrians and tempt\r\nthem into an arena where the personal prowess of the French veterans\r\nwould have ample scope, and where numbers would be of secondary\r\nimportance. Only heads of columns could come into direct contact; and\r\nthe formidable Austrian cavalry could not display its usual prowess.\r\nOn these facts Bonaparte counted as a set-off to his slight\r\ninferiority in numbers.\r\n\r\nIn the dead of night the divisions of Augereau and Masséna retired\r\nthrough Verona. Officers and soldiers were alike deeply discouraged by\r\nthis movement, which seemed to presage a retreat towards the Mincio\r\nand the abandonment of Lombardy. To their surprise, when outside the\r\ngate they received the order to turn to the left down the western bank\r\nof the Adige. At Ronco the mystery was solved. A bridge of boats had\r\nthere been thrown across the Adige; and, crossing this without\r\nopposition, Augereau's troops rapidly advanced along the causeway\r\nleading to Arcola and menaced the Austrian rear, while Masséna's\r\ncolumn denied north-west, so as directly to threaten his flank at\r\nCaldiero. The surprise, however, was by no means complete; for\r\nAlvintzy himself purposed to cross the Adige at Zevio, so as to make a\r\ndash on Mantua, and in order to protect his flank he had sent a\r\ndetachment of Croats to hold Arcola. These now stoutly disputed\r\nAugereau's progress, pouring in from the loopholed cottages volleys\r\nwhich tore away the front of every column of attack. In vain did\r\nAugereau, seizing the colours, lead his foremost regiment to the\r\nbridge of Arcola. Riddled by the musketry, his men fell back in\r\ndisorder. In vain did Bonaparte himself, dismounting from his charger,\r\nseize a flag, rally these veterans and lead them towards the bridge.\r\nThe Croats, constantly reinforced, poured in so deadly a fire as to\r\ncheck the advance: Muiron, Marmont, and a handful of gallant men still\r\npressed on, thereby screening the body of their chief; but Muiron fell\r\ndead, and another officer, seizing Bonaparte, sought to drag him back\r\nfrom certain death. The column wavered under the bullets, fell back to\r\nthe further side of the causeway, and in the confusion the commander\r\nfell into the deep dyke at the side. Agonized at the sight, the French\r\nrallied, while Marmont and Louis Bonaparte rescued their beloved chief\r\nfrom capture or from a miry death, and he retired to Ronco, soon\r\nfollowed by the wearied troops.[67]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN TO ILLUSTRATE THE VICTORY OF ARCOLA.]\r\n\r\nThis memorable first day of fighting at Arcola (November 15th) closed\r\non the strange scene of two armies encamped on dykes, exhausted by an\r\nalmost amphibious conflict, like that waged by the Dutch \"Beggars\" in\r\ntheir war of liberation against Spain. Though at Arcola the\r\nrepublicans had been severely checked, yet further west Masséna had\r\nheld his own; and the French movement as a whole had compelled\r\nAlvintzy to suspend any advance on Verona or on Mantua, to come down\r\nfrom the heights of Caldiero, and to fight on ground where his\r\nsuperior numbers were of little avail. This was seen on the second day\r\nof fighting on the dykes opposite Arcola, which was, on the whole,\r\nfavourable to the smaller veteran force. On the third day Bonaparte\r\nemployed a skilful ruse to add to the discouragement of his foes. He\r\nposted a small body of horsemen behind a spinney near the Austrian\r\nflank, with orders to sound their trumpets as if for a great cavalry\r\ncharge. Alarmed by the noise and by the appearance of French troops\r\nfrom the side of Legnago and behind Arcola, the demoralized\r\nwhite-coats suddenly gave way and retreated for Vicenza.\r\n\r\nVictory again declared for the troops who could dare the longest, and\r\nwhose general was never at a loss in face of any definite danger. Both\r\narmies suffered severely in these desperate conflicts;[68] but, while\r\nthe Austrians felt that the cup of victory had been snatched from\r\ntheir very lips, the French soldiery were dazzled by this transcendent\r\nexploit of their chief. They extolled his bravery, which almost vied\r\nwith the fabulous achievement of Horatius Cocles, and adored the\r\ngenius which saw safety and victory for his discouraged army amidst\r\nswamps and dykes. Bonaparte himself, with that strange mingling of the\r\npractical and the superstitious which forms the charm of his\r\ncharacter, ever afterwards dated the dawn of his fortune in its full\r\nsplendour from those hours of supreme crisis among the morasses of\r\nArcola. But we may doubt whether this posing as the favourite of\r\nfortune was not the result of his profound knowledge of the credulity\r\nof the vulgar herd, which admires genius and worships bravery, but\r\ngrovels before persistent good luck.\r\n\r\nThough it is difficult to exaggerate the skill and bravery of the\r\nFrench leader and his troops, the failure of his opponents is\r\ninexplicable but for the fact that most of their troops were unable to\r\nmanoeuvre steadily in the open, that Alvintzy was inexperienced as a\r\ncommander-in-chief, and was hampered throughout by a bad plan of\r\ncampaign. Meanwhile the other Austrian army, led by Davidovich, had\r\ndriven Vaubois from his position at Rivoli; and had the Imperialist\r\ngenerals kept one another informed of their moves, or had Alvintzy,\r\ndisregarding a blare of trumpets and a demonstration on his flank and\r\nrear, clung to Arcola for two days longer--the French would have been\r\nnipped between superior forces. But, as it was, the lack of accord in\r\nthe Austrian movements nearly ruined the Tyrolese wing, which pushed\r\non triumphantly towards Verona, while Alvintzy was retreating\r\neastwards. Warned just in time, Davidovich hastily retreated to\r\nRoveredo, leaving a whole battalion in the hands of the French. To\r\ncrown this chapter of blunders, Würmser, whose sortie after Caldiero\r\nmight have been most effective, tardily essayed to break through the\r\nblockaders, when both his colleagues were in retreat. How different\r\nwere these ill-assorted moves from those of Bonaparte. His maxims\r\nthroughout this campaign, and his whole military career, were: (1)\r\ndivide for foraging, concentrate for fighting; (2) unity of command is\r\nessential for success; (3) time is everything. This firm grasp of the\r\nessentials of modern warfare insured his triumph over enemies who\r\ntrusted to obsolete methods for the defence of antiquated\r\npolities.[69]\r\n\r\nThe battle of Arcola had an important influence on the fate of Italy\r\nand Europe. In the peninsula all the elements hostile to the\r\nrepublicans were preparing for an explosion in their rear which should\r\nreaffirm the old saying that Italy was the tomb of the French. Naples\r\nhad signed terms of peace with them, it is true; but the natural\r\nanimosity of the Vatican against its despoilers could easily have\r\nleagued the south of Italy with the other States that were working\r\nsecretly for their expulsion. While the Austrians were victoriously\r\nadvancing, these aims were almost openly avowed, and at the close of\r\nthe year 1796 Bonaparte moved south to Bologna in order to guide the\r\nItalian patriots in their deliberations and menace the Pope with an\r\ninvasion of the Roman States. From this the Pontiff was for the\r\npresent saved by new efforts on the part of Austria. But before\r\ndescribing the final attempt of the Hapsburgs to wrest Italy from\r\ntheir able adversary, it will be well to notice his growing ascendancy\r\nin diplomatic affairs.\r\n\r\nWhile Bonaparte was struggling in the marshes of Arcola, the Directory\r\nwas on the point of sending to Vienna an envoy, General Clarke, with\r\nproposals for an armistice preliminary to negotiations for peace with\r\nAustria. This step was taken, because France was distracted by open\r\nrevolt in the south, by general discontent in the west, and by the\r\nretreat of her Rhenish armies, now flung back on the soil of the\r\nRepublic by the Austrian Arch-duke Charles. Unable to support large\r\nforces in the east of France out of its bankrupt exchequer, the\r\nDirectory desired to be informed of the state of feeling at Vienna. It\r\ntherefore sent Clarke with offers, which might enable him to look into\r\nthe political and military situation at the enemy's capital, and see\r\nwhether peace could not be gained at the price of some of Bonaparte's\r\nconquests. The envoy was an elegant and ambitious young man, descended\r\nfrom an Irish family long settled in France, who had recently gained\r\nCarnot's favour, and now desired to show his diplomatic skill by\r\nsubjecting Bonaparte to the present aims of the Directory.\r\n\r\nThe Directors' secret instructions reveal the plans which they then\r\nharboured for the reconstruction of the Continent. Having arranged an\r\narmistice which should last up to the end of the next spring, Clarke\r\nwas to set forth arrangements which might suit the House of Hapsburg.\r\nHe might discuss the restitution of all their possessions in Italy,\r\nand the acquisition of the Bishopric of Salzburg and other smaller\r\nGerman and Swabian territories: or, if she did not recover the\r\nMilanese, Austria might gain the northern parts of the Papal States as\r\ncompensation; and the Duke of Tuscany--a Hapsburg--might reign at\r\nRome, yielding up his duchy to the Duke of Parma; while, as this last\r\npotentate was a Spanish Bourbon, France might for her good offices to\r\nthis House gain largely from Spain in America.[70] In these and other\r\nproposals two methods of bargaining are everywhere prominent. The\r\ngreat States are in every case to gain at the expense of their weaker\r\nneighbours; Austria is to be appeased; and France is to reap enormous\r\ngains ultimately at the expense of smaller Germanic or Italian States.\r\nThese facts should clearly be noted. Napoleon was afterwards\r\ndeservedly blamed for carrying out these unprincipled methods; but, at\r\nthe worst, he only developed them from those of the Directors, who,\r\nwith the cant of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity on their lips,\r\nbattened on the plunder of the liberated lands, and cynically proposed\r\nto share the spoil of weaker States with the potentates against whom\r\nthey publicly declaimed as tyrants.\r\n\r\nThe chief aim of these negotiations, so Clarke was assured, was to\r\nconvince the Court of Vienna that it would get better terms by\r\ntreating with France directly and alone, rather than by joining in the\r\nnegotiations which had recently been opened at Paris by England. But\r\nthe Viennese Ministers refused to allow Clarke to proceed to their\r\ncapital, and appointed Vicenza as the seat of the deliberations.\r\n\r\nThey were brief. Through the complex web of civilian intrigue,\r\nBonaparte forthwith thrust the mailed hand of the warrior. He had\r\nlittle difficulty in proving to Clarke that the situation was\r\nmaterially altered by the battle of Arcola. The fall of Mantua was now\r\nonly a matter of weeks. To allow its provisions to be replenished for\r\nthe term of the armistice was an act that no successful general could\r\ntolerate. For that fortress the whole campaign had been waged, and\r\nthree Austrian armies had been hurled back into Tyrol and Friuli. Was\r\nit now to be provisioned, in order that the Directory might barter\r\naway the Cispadane Republic? He speedily convinced Clarke of the\r\nfatuity of the Directors' proposals. He imbued him with his own\r\ncontempt for an armistice that would rob the victors of their prize;\r\nand, as the Court of Vienna still indulged hopes of success in Italy,\r\nClarke's negotiations at Vicenza came to a speedy conclusion.\r\n\r\nIn another important matter the Directory also completely failed.\r\nNervous as to Bonaparte's ambition, it had secretly ordered Clarke to\r\nwatch his conduct and report privately to Paris. Whether warned by a\r\nfriend at Court, or forearmed by his own sagacity, Bonaparte knew of\r\nthis, and in his intercourse with Clarke deftly let the fact be seen.\r\nHe quickly gauged Clarke's powers, and the aim of his mission. \"He is\r\na spy,\" he remarked a little later to Miot, \"whom the Directory have\r\nset upon me: he is a man of no talent--only conceited.\" The splendour\r\nof his achievements and the mingled grace and authority of his\r\ndemeanour so imposed on the envoy that he speedily fell under the\r\ninfluence of the very man whom he was to watch, and became his\r\nenthusiastic adherent.\r\n\r\nBonaparte was at Bologna, supervising the affairs of the Cispadane\r\nRepublic, when he heard that the Austrians were making a last effort\r\nfor the relief of Mantua. Another plan had been drawn up by the Aulic\r\nCouncil at Vienna. Alvintzy, after recruiting his wearied force at\r\nBassano, was quickly to join the Tyrolese column at Roveredo, thereby\r\nforming an army of 28,000 men wherewith to force the position of\r\nRivoli and drive the French in on Mantua: 9,000 Imperialists under\r\nProvera were also to advance from the Brenta upon Legnago, in order to\r\nwithdraw the attention of the French from the real attempt made by the\r\nvalley of the Adige; while 10,000 others at Bassano and elsewhere were\r\nto assail the French front at different points and hinder their\r\nconcentration. It will be observed that the errors of July and\r\nNovember, 1796, were now yet a third time to be committed: the forces\r\ndestined merely to make diversions were so strengthened as not to be\r\nmerely light bodies distracting the aim of the French, while\r\nAlvintzy's main force was thereby so weakened as to lack the impact\r\nnecessary for victory.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Imperialists at first threw back their foes with\r\nsome losses; and Bonaparte, hurrying northwards to Verona, was for\r\nsome hours in a fever of uncertainty as to the movements and strength\r\nof the assailants. Late at night on January 13th he knew that\r\nProvera's advance was little more than a demonstration, and that the\r\nreal blow would fall on the 10,000 men marshalled by Joubert at Monte\r\nBaldo and Rivoli. Forthwith he rode to the latter place, and changed\r\nretreat and discouragement into a vigorous offensive by the news that\r\n13,000 more men were on the march to defend the strong position of\r\nRivoli.\r\n\r\nThe great defensive strength of this plateau had from the first\r\nattracted his attention. There the Adige in a sharp bend westward\r\napproaches within six miles of Lake Garda. There, too, the mountains,\r\nwhich hem in the gorge of the river on its right bank, bend away\r\ntowards the lake and leave a vast natural amphitheatre, near the\r\ncentre of which rises the irregular plateau that commands the exit\r\nfrom Tyrol. Over this plateau towers on the north Monte Baldo, which,\r\nnear the river gorge, sends out southward a sloping ridge, known as\r\nSan Marco, connecting it with the plateau. At the foot of this spur is\r\nthe summit of the road which leads the traveller from Trent to Verona;\r\nand, as he halts at the top of the zigzag, near the village of Rivoli,\r\nhis eye sweeps over the winding gorge of the river beneath, the\r\nthreatening mass of Monte Baldo on the north, and on the west of the\r\nvillage he gazes down on a natural depression which has been sharply\r\nfurrowed by a torrent. The least experienced eye can see that the\r\nposition is one of great strength. It is a veritable parade ground\r\namong the mountains, almost cut off from them by the ceaseless action\r\nof water, and destined for the defence of the plains of Italy. A small\r\nforce posted at the head of the winding roadway can hold at bay an\r\narmy toiling up from the valley; but, as at Thermopylae, the position\r\nis liable to be outflanked by an enterprising foe, who should scale\r\nthe footpath leading over the western offshoots of Monte Baldo, and,\r\nfording the stream at its foot, should then advance eastwards against\r\nthe village. This, in part, was Alvintzy's plan, and having nearly\r\n28,000 men,[71] he doubted not that his enveloping tactics must\r\ncapture Joubert's division of 10,000 men. So daunted was even this\r\nbrave general by the superior force of his foes that he had ordered a\r\nretreat southwards when an aide-de-camp arrived at full gallop and\r\nordered him to hold Rivoli at all costs. Bonaparte's arrival at 4 a.m.\r\nexplained the order, and an attack made during the darkness wrested\r\nfrom the Austrians the chapel on the San Marco ridge which stands on\r\nthe ridge above the zigzag track. The reflection of the Austrian\r\nwatch-fires in the wintry sky showed him their general position. To an\r\nunskilled observer the wide sweep of the glare portended ruin for the\r\nFrench. To the eye of Bonaparte the sight brought hope. It proved that\r\nhis foes were still bent on their old plan of enveloping him: and from\r\ninformation which he treacherously received from Alvintzy's staff he\r\nmust have known that that commander had far fewer than the 45,000 men\r\nwhich he ascribed to him in bulletins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEIGHBOURHOOD OF RIVOLI.]\r\n\r\nYet the full dawn of that January day saw the Imperialists flushed\r\nwith success, as their six separate columns drove in the French\r\noutposts and moved towards Rivoli. Of these, one was on the eastern\r\nside of the Adige and merely cannonaded across the valley: another\r\ncolumn wound painfully with most of the artillery and cavalry along\r\nthe western bank, making for the village of Incanale and the foot of\r\nthe zigzag leading up to Rivoli: three others denied over Monte Baldo\r\nby difficult paths impassable to cannon: while the sixth and\r\nwesternmost column, winding along the ridge near Lake Garda, likewise\r\nlacked the power which field-guns and horsemen would have added to its\r\nimportant turning movement. Never have natural obstacles told more\r\npotently on the fortunes of war than at Rivoli; for on the side where\r\nthe assailants most needed horses and guns they could not be used;\r\nwhile on the eastern edge of their broken front their cannon and\r\nhorse, crowded together in the valley of the Adige, had to climb the\r\nwinding road under the plunging fire of the French infantry and\r\nartillery. Nevertheless, such was the ardour of the Austrian attack,\r\nthat the tide of battle at first set strongly in their favour. Driving\r\nthe French from the San Marco ridge and pressing their centre hard\r\nbetween Monte Baldo and Rivoli, they made it possible for their troops\r\nin the valley to struggle on towards the foot of the zigzag; and on\r\nthe west their distant right wing was already beginning to threaten\r\nthe French rear. Despite the arrival of Masséna's troops from Verona\r\nabout 9 a.m., the republicans showed signs of unsteadiness. Joubert on\r\nthe ground above the Adige, Berthier in the centre, and Masséna on the\r\nleft, were gradually forced back. An Austrian column, advancing from\r\nthe side of Monte Baldo by the narrow ravine, stole round the flank of\r\na French regiment in front of Masséna's division, and by a vigorous\r\ncharge sent it flying in a panic which promised to spread to another\r\nregiment thus uncovered. This was too much for the veteran, already\r\ndubbed \"the spoilt child of victory \"; he rushed to its captain,\r\nbitterly upbraided him and the other officers, and finally showered\r\nblows on them with the flat of his sword. Then, riding at full speed\r\nto two tried regiments of his own division, he ordered them to check\r\nthe foe; and these invincible heroes promptly drove back the\r\nassailants. Even so, however, the valour of the best French regiments\r\nand the skill of Masséna, Berthier, and Joubert barely sufficed to\r\nhold back the onstreaming tide of white-coats opposite Rivoli.\r\n\r\nYet even at this crisis the commander, confident in his central\r\nposition, and knowing his ability to ward off the encircling swoops of\r\nthe Austrian eagle, maintained that calm demeanour which moved the\r\nwonder of smaller minds. His confidence in his seasoned troops was not\r\nmisplaced. The Imperialists, overburdened by long marches and faint\r\nnow for lack of food, could not maintain their first advantage. Some\r\nof their foremost troops, that had won the broken ground in front of\r\nSt. Mark's Chapel, were suddenly charged by French horse; they fled in\r\npanic, crying out, \"French cavalry!\" and the space won was speedily\r\nabandoned to the tricolour. This sudden rebuff was to dash all their\r\nhopes of victory; for at that crisis of the day the chief Austrian\r\ncolumn of nearly 8,000 men was struggling up the zigzag ascent leading\r\nfrom the valley of the Adige to the plateau, in the fond hope that\r\ntheir foes were by this time driven from the summit. Despite the\r\nterrible fire that tore their flanks, the Imperialists were clutching\r\ndesperately at the plateau, when Bonaparte put forth his full striking\r\npower. He could now assail the crowded ranks of the doomed column in\r\nfront and on both flanks. A charge of Leclerc's horse and of Joubert's\r\ninfantry crushed its head; volleys of cannon and musketry from the\r\nplateau tore its sides; an ammunition wagon exploded in its midst; and\r\nthe great constrictor forthwith writhed its bleeding coils back into\r\nthe valley, where it lay crushed and helpless for the rest of the\r\nfight.\r\n\r\nAnimated by this lightning stroke of their commander, the French\r\nturned fiercely towards Monte Baldo and drove back their opponents\r\ninto the depression at its foot. But already at their rear loud shouts\r\nwarned them of a new danger. The western detachment of the\r\nImperialists had meanwhile worked round their rear, and, ignorant of\r\nthe fate of their comrades, believed that Bonaparte's army was caught\r\nin a trap. The eyes of all the French staff officers were now turned\r\nanxiously on their commander, who quietly remarked, \"We have them\r\nnow.\" He knew, in fact, that other French troops marching up from\r\nVerona would take these new foes in the rear; and though Junot and his\r\nhorsemen failed to cut their way through so as to expedite their\r\napproach, yet speedily a French regiment burst through the encircling\r\nline and joined in the final attack which drove these last assailants\r\nfrom the heights south of Rivoli, and later on compelled them to\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\nThus closed the desperate battle of Rivoli (January 14th). Defects in\r\nthe Austrian position and the opportune arrival of French\r\nreinforcements served to turn an Austrian success into a complete\r\nrout. Circumstances which to a civilian may seem singly to be of small\r\naccount sufficed to tilt the trembling scales of warfare, and\r\nAlvintzy's army now reeled helplessly back into Tyrol with a total\r\nloss of 15,000 men and of nearly all its artillery and stores. Leaving\r\nJoubert to pursue it towards Trent, Bonaparte now flew southwards\r\ntowards Mantua, whither Provera had cut his way. Again his untiring\r\nenergy, his insatiable care for all probable contingencies, reaped a\r\nsuccess which the ignorant may charge to the account of his fortune.\r\nStrengthening Augereau's division by light troops, he captured the\r\nwhole of Provera's army at La Favorita, near the walls of Mantua\r\n(January 16th). The natural result of these two dazzling triumphs was\r\nthe fall of the fortress for which the Emperor Francis had risked and\r\nlost five armies. Würmser surrendered Mantua on February 2nd with\r\n18,000 men and immense supplies of arms and stores. The close of this\r\nwondrous campaign was graced by an act of clemency. Generous terms\r\nwere accorded to the veteran marshal, whose fidelity to blundering\r\ncouncillors at Vienna had thrown up in brilliant relief the prudence,\r\naudacity, and resourcefulness of the young war-god.\r\n\r\nIt was now time to chastise the Pope for his support of the enemies of\r\nFrance. The Papalini proved to be contemptible as soldiers. They fled\r\nbefore the republicans, and a military promenade brought the invaders\r\nto Ancona, and then inland to Tolentino, where Pius VI. sued for\r\npeace. The resulting treaty signed at that place (February 19th)\r\ncondemned the Holy See to close its ports to the allies, especially to\r\nthe English; to acknowledge the acquisition of Avignon by France, and\r\nthe establishment of the Cispadane Republic at Bologna, Ferrara, and\r\nthe surrounding districts; to pay 30,000,000 francs to the French\r\nGovernment; and to surrender 100 works of art to the victorious\r\nrepublicans.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to describe the remaining stages in Bonaparte's\r\ncampaign against Austria. Hitherto he had contended against fairly\r\ngood, though discontented and discouraged troops, badly led, and\r\nhampered by the mountain barrier which separated them from their real\r\nbase of operations. In the last part of the war he fought against\r\ntroops demoralized by an almost unbroken chain of disasters. The\r\nAustrians were now led by a brave and intelligent general, the\r\nArchduke Charles; but he was hampered by rigorous instructions from\r\nVienna, by senile and indolent generals, by the indignation or despair\r\nof the younger officers at the official favouritism which left them in\r\nobscurity, and by the apathy of soldiers who had lost heart. Neither\r\nhis skill nor the natural strength of their positions in Friuli and\r\nCarinthia could avail against veterans flushed with victory and\r\nmarshalled with unerring sagacity. The rest of the war only served to\r\nemphasize the truth of Napoleon's later statement, that the moral\r\nelement constitutes three-fourths of an army's strength. The barriers\r\noffered by the River Tagliamento and the many commanding heights of\r\nthe Carnic and the Noric Alps were as nothing to the triumphant\r\nrepublicans; and from the heights that guard the province of Styria,\r\nthe genius of Napoleon flashed as a terrifying portent to the Court of\r\nVienna and the potentates of Central Europe. When the tricolour\r\nstandards were nearing the town of Leoben, the Emperor Francis sent\r\nenvoys to sue for peace;[72] and the preliminaries signed there,\r\nwithin one hundred miles of the Austrian capital, closed the campaign\r\nwhich a year previously had opened with so little promise for the\r\nFrench on the narrow strip of land between the Maritime Alps and the\r\npetty township of Savona.\r\n\r\nThese brilliant results were due primarily to the consummate\r\nleadership of Bonaparte. His geographical instincts discerned the\r\nmeans of profiting by natural obstacles and of turning them when they\r\nseemed to screen his opponents. Prompt to divine their plans, he\r\nbewildered them by the audacity of his combinations, which overbore\r\ntheir columns with superior force at the very time when he seemed\r\ndoomed to succumb. Genius so commanding had not been displayed even by\r\nFrederick or Marlborough. And yet these brilliant results could not\r\nhave been achieved by an army which rarely exceeded 45,000 men without\r\nthe strenuous bravery and tactical skill of the best generals of\r\ndivision, Augereau, Masséna, and Joubert, as well as of officers who\r\nhad shown their worth in many a doubtful fight; Lannes, the hero of\r\nLodi and Arcola; Marmont, noted for his daring advance of the guns at\r\nCastiglione; Victor, who justified his name by hard fighting at La\r\nFavorita; Murat, the _beau sabreur_, and Junot, both dashing cavalry\r\ngenerals; and many more whose daring earned them a soldier's death in\r\norder to gain glory for France and liberty for Italy. Still less ought\r\nthe soldiery to be forgotten; those troops, whose tattered uniforms\r\nbespoke their ceaseless toils, who grumbled at the frequent lack of\r\nbread, but, as Masséna observed, never _before_ a battle, who even in\r\nretreat never doubted the genius of their chief, and fiercely rallied\r\nat the longed-for sign of fighting. The source of this marvellous\r\nenergy is not hard to discover. Their bravery was fed by that\r\nwellspring of hope which had made of France a nation of free men\r\ndetermined to free the millions beyond their frontiers. The French\r\ncolumns were \"equality on the march\"; and the soldiery, animated by\r\nthis grand enthusiasm, found its militant embodiment in the great\r\ncaptain who seemed about to liberate Italy and Central Europe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nLEOBEN TO CAMPO FORMIO\r\n\r\n\r\nIn signing the preliminaries of peace at Leoben, which formed in part\r\nthe basis for the Treaty of Campo Formio, Bonaparte appears as a\r\ndiplomatist of the first rank. He had already signed similar articles\r\nwith the Court of Turin and with the Vatican. But such a transaction\r\nwith the Emperor was infinitely more important than with the\r\nthird-rate powers of the peninsula. He now essays his first flight to\r\nthe highest levels of international diplomacy. In truth, his mental\r\nendowments, like those of many of the greatest generals, were no less\r\nadapted to success in the council-chamber than on the field of battle;\r\nfor, indeed, the processes of thought and the methods of action are\r\nnot dissimilar in the spheres of diplomacy and war. To evade obstacles\r\non which an opponent relies, to multiply them in his path, to bewilder\r\nhim by feints before overwhelming him by a crushing onset, these are\r\nthe arts which yield success either to the negotiator or to the\r\ncommander.\r\n\r\nIn imposing terms of peace on the Emperor at Leoben (April 18th,\r\n1797), Bonaparte reduced the Directory, and its envoy, Clarke, who was\r\nabsent in Italy, to a subordinate _rôle_. As commander-in-chief, he\r\nhad power only to conclude a brief armistice, but now he signed the\r\npreliminaries of peace. His excuse to the Directory was ingenious.\r\nWhile admitting the irregularity of his conduct, he pleaded the\r\nisolated position of his army, and the absence of Clarke, and that,\r\nunder the circumstances, his act had been merely \"a military\r\noperation.\" He could also urge that he had in his rear a disaffected\r\nVenetia, and that he believed the French armies on the Rhine to be\r\nstationary and unable to cross that river. But the very tardy advent\r\nof Clarke on the scene strengthens the supposition that Bonaparte was\r\nat the time by no means loth to figure as the pacifier of the\r\nContinent. Had he known the whole truth, namely, that the French were\r\ngaining a battle on the east bank of the Rhine while the terms of\r\npeace were being signed at Leoben, he would most certainly have broken\r\noff the negotiations and have dictated harsher terms at the gates of\r\nVienna. That was the vision which shone before his eyes three years\r\npreviously, when he sketched to his friends at Nice the plan of\r\ncampaign, beginning at Savona and ending before the Austrian capital;\r\nand great was his chagrin at hearing the tidings of Moreau's success\r\non April 20th. The news reached him on his return from Leoben to\r\nItaly, when he was detained for a few hours by a sudden flood of the\r\nRiver Tagliamento. At once he determined to ride back and make some\r\nexcuse for a rupture with Austria; and only the persistent\r\nremonstrances of Berthier turned him from this mad resolve, which\r\nwould forthwith have exhibited him to the world as estimating more\r\nhighly the youthful promptings of destiny than the honour of a French\r\nnegotiator.\r\n\r\nThe terms which he had granted to the Emperor were lenient enough. The\r\nonly definitive gain to France was the acquisition of the Austrian\r\nNetherlands (Belgium), for which troublesome possession the Emperor\r\nwas to have compensation elsewhere. Nothing absolutely binding was\r\nsaid about the left, or west, bank of the Rhine, except that Austria\r\nrecognized the \"constitutional limits\" of France, but reaffirmed the\r\nintegrity of \"The Empire.\"[73] These were contradictory statements;\r\nfor France had declared the Rhine to be her natural boundary, and the\r\nold \"Empire\" included Belgium, Trèves, and Luxemburg. But, for the\r\ninterpretation of these vague formularies, the following secret and\r\nall-important articles were appended. While the Emperor renounced that\r\npart of his Italian possessions which lay to the west of the Oglio, he\r\nwas to receive all the mainland territories of Venice east of that\r\nriver, including Dalmatia and Istria, Venice was also to cede her\r\nlands west of the Oglio to the French Government; and in return for\r\nthese sacrifices she was to gain the three legations of Romagna,\r\nFerrara, and Bologna--the very lands which Bonaparte had recently\r\nformed into the Cispadane Republic! For the rest, the Emperor would\r\nhave to recognize the proposed Republic at Milan, as also that already\r\nexisting at Modena, \"compensation\" being somewhere found for the\r\ndeposed duke.\r\n\r\nFrom the correspondence of Thugut, the Austrian Minister, it appears\r\ncertain that Austria herself had looked forward to the partition of\r\nthe Venetian mainland territories, and this was the scheme which\r\nBonaparte _actually proposed to her at Leoben_. Still more\r\nextraordinary was his proposal to sacrifice, ostensibly to Venice but\r\nultimately to Austria, the greater part of the Cispadane Republic. It\r\nis, indeed, inexplicable, except on the ground that his military\r\nposition at Leoben was more brilliant than secure. His uneasiness\r\nabout this article of the preliminaries is seen in his letter of April\r\n22nd to the Directors, which explains that the preliminaries need not\r\ncount for much. But most extraordinary of all was his procedure\r\nconcerning the young Lombard Republic. He seems quite calmly to have\r\ndiscussed its retrocession to the Austrians, and that, too, after he\r\nhad encouraged the Milanese to found a republic, and had declared that\r\nevery French victory was \"a line of the constitutional charter.\"[74]\r\nThe most reasonable explanation is that Bonaparte over-estimated the\r\nmilitary strength of Austria, and undervalued the energy of the men of\r\nMilan, Modena, and Bologna, of whose levies he spoke most\r\ncontemptuously. Certain it is that he desired to disengage himself\r\nfrom their affairs so as to be free for the grander visions of\r\noriental conquest that now haunted his imagination. Whatever were his\r\nmotives in signing the preliminaries at Leoben, he speedily found\r\nmeans for their modification in the ever-enlarging area of negotiable\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nIt is now time to return to the affairs of Venice. For seven months\r\nthe towns and villages of that republic had been a prey to pitiless\r\nwarfare and systematic rapacity, a fate which the weak ruling\r\noligarchy could neither avert nor avenge. In the western cities,\r\nBergamo and Brescia, whose interests and feelings linked them with\r\nMilan rather than Venice, the populace desired an alliance with the\r\nnascent republic on the west and a severance from the gloomy\r\ndespotism of the Queen of the Adriatic. Though glorious in her prime,\r\nshe now governed with obscurantist methods inspired by fear of her\r\nweakness becoming manifest; and Bonaparte, tearing off the mask which\r\nhitherto had screened her dotage, left her despised by the more\r\nprogressive of her own subjects. Even before he first entered the\r\nVenetian territory, he set forth to the Directory the facilities for\r\nplunder and partition which it offered. Referring to its reception of\r\nthe Comte de Provence (the future Louis XVIII.) and the occupation of\r\nPeschiera by the Austrians, he wrote (June 6th, 1796):\r\n\r\n     \"If your plan is to extract five or six million francs from Venice,\r\n     I have expressly prepared for you this sort of rupture with her....\r\n     If you have intentions more pronounced, I think that you ought to\r\n     continue this subject of contention, instruct me as to your\r\n     desires, and wait for the favourable opportunity, which I will\r\n     seize according to circumstances, for we must not have everybody on\r\n     our hands at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nThe events which now transpired in Venetia gave him excuses for the\r\nprojected partition. The weariness felt by the Brescians and\r\nBergamesques for Venetian rule had been artfully played on by the\r\nJacobins of Milan and by the French Generals Kilmaine and Landrieux;\r\nand an effort made by the Venetian officials to repress the growing\r\ndiscontent brought about disturbances in which some men of the\r\n\"Lombard legion\" were killed. The complicity of the French in the\r\nrevolt is clearly established by the Milanese journals and by the fact\r\nthat Landrieux forthwith accepted the command of the rebels at Bergamo\r\nand Brescia.[75] But while these cities espoused the Jacobin cause,\r\nmost of the Venetian towns and all the peasantry remained faithful to\r\nthe old Government. It was clear that a conflict must ensue, even if\r\nBonaparte and some of his generals had not secretly worked to bring it\r\nabout. That he and they did so work cannot now be disputed. The circle\r\nof proof is complete. The events at Brescia and Bergamo were part of\r\na scheme for precipitating a rupture with Venice; and their success\r\nwas so far assured that Bonaparte at Leoben secretly bargained away\r\nnearly the whole of the Venetian lands. Furthermore, a fortnight\r\nbefore the signing of these preliminaries, he had suborned a vile\r\nwretch, Salvatori by name, to issue a proclamation purporting to come\r\nfrom the Venetian authorities, which urged the people everywhere to\r\nrise and massacre the French. It was issued on April 5th, though it\r\nbore the date of March 20th. At once the Doge warned his people that\r\nit was a base fabrication, But the mischief had been done. On Easter\r\nMonday (April 17th) a chance affray in Verona let loose the passions\r\nwhich had been rising for months past: the populace rose in fury\r\nagainst the French detachment quartered on them: and all the soldiers\r\nwho could not find shelter in the citadel, even the sick in the\r\nhospitals, fell victims to the craving for revenge for the\r\nhumiliations and exactions of the last seven months.[76] Such was\r\nEaster-tide at Verona--_les Pâques véronaises_--an event that recalls\r\nthe Sicilian Vespers of Palermo in its blind southern fury.\r\n\r\nThe finale somewhat exceeded Bonaparte's expectations, but he must\r\nhave hailed it with a secret satisfaction. It gave him a good excuse\r\nfor wholly extinguishing Venice as an independent power. According to\r\nthe secret articles signed at Leoben, the city of Venice was to have\r\nretained her independence and gained the Legations. But her contumacy\r\ncould now be chastised by annihilation. Venice could, in fact,\r\nindemnify the Hapsburgs for the further cessions which France exacted\r\nfrom them elsewhere; and in the process Bonaparte would free himself\r\nfrom the blame which attached to his hasty signature of the\r\npreliminaries at Leoben.[77] He was now determined to secure the Rhine\r\nfrontier for France, to gain independence, under French tutelage, not\r\nonly for the Lombard Republic, but also for Modena and the Legations.\r\nThese were his aims during the negotiations to which he gave the full\r\nforce of his intellect during the spring and summer of 1797.\r\n\r\nThe first thing was to pour French troops into Italy so as to extort\r\nbetter terms: the next was to declare war on Venice. For this there\r\nwas now ample justification; for, apart from the massacre at Verona,\r\nanother outrage had been perpetrated. A French corsair, which had\r\npersisted in anchoring in a forbidden part of the harbour of Venice,\r\nhad been riddled by the batteries and captured. For this act, and for\r\nthe outbreak at Verona, the Doge and Senate offered ample reparation:\r\nbut Bonaparte refused to listen to these envoys, \"dripping with French\r\nblood,\" and haughtily bade Venice evacuate her mainland\r\nterritories.[78] For various reasons he decided to use guile rather\r\nthan force. He found in Venice a secretary of the French legation,\r\nVilletard by name, who could be trusted dextrously to undermine the\r\ncrumbling fabric of the oligarchy.[79] This man persuaded the\r\nterrified populace that nothing would appease the fury of the\r\nFrench general but the deposition of the existing oligarchy and the\r\nformation of a democratic municipality. The people and the patricians\r\nalike swallowed the bait; and the once haughty Senate tamely\r\npronounced its own doom. Disorders naturally occurred on the downfall\r\nof the ancient oligarchy, especially when the new municipality ordered\r\nthe removal of Venetian men-of-war into the hands of the French and\r\nthe introduction of French troops by help of Venetian vessels. A\r\nmournful silence oppressed even the democrats when 5,000 French troops\r\nentered Venice on board the flotilla. The famous State, which for\r\ncenturies had ruled the waters of the Levant, and had held the fierce\r\nTurks at bay, a people numbering 3,000,000 souls and boasting a\r\nrevenue of 9,000,000 ducats, now struck not one blow against\r\nconquerors who came in the guise of liberators.\r\n\r\nOn the same day Bonaparte signed at Milan a treaty of alliance with\r\nthe envoys of the new Venetian Government. His friendship was to be\r\ndearly bought. In secret articles, which were of more import than the\r\nvague professions of amity which filled the public document, it was\r\nstipulated that the French and Venetian Republics should come to an\r\nunderstanding as to the _exchange_ of certain territories, that Venice\r\nshould pay a contribution in money and in materials of war, should aid\r\nthe French navy by furnishing three battleships and two frigates, and\r\nshould enrich the museums of her benefactress by 20 paintings and 500\r\nmanuscripts. While he was signing these conditions of peace, the\r\nDirectors were despatching from Paris a declaration of war against\r\nVenice. Their decision was already obsolete: it was founded on\r\nBonaparte's despatch of April 30th; but in the interval their\r\nproconsul had wholly changed the situation by overthrowing the rule of\r\nthe Doge and Senate, and by setting up a democracy, through which he\r\ncould extract the wealth of that land. The Directors' declaration of\r\nwar was accordingly stopped at Milan, and no more was heard of it.\r\nThey were thus forcibly reminded of the truth of his previous warning\r\nthat things would certainly go wrong unless they consulted him on all\r\nimportant details.[80]\r\n\r\nThis treaty of Milan was the fourth important convention concluded by\r\nthe general, who, at the beginning of the campaign of 1796, had been\r\nforbidden even to sign an armistice without consulting Salicetti!\r\n\r\nIt was speedily followed by another, which in many respects redounds\r\nto the credit of the young conqueror. If his conduct towards Venice\r\ninspires loathing, his treatment of Genoa must excite surprise and\r\nadmiration. Apart from one very natural outburst of spleen, it shows\r\nlittle of that harshness which might have been expected from the man\r\nwho had looked on Genoa as the embodiment of mean despotism. Up to the\r\nsummer of 1796 Bonaparte seems to have retained something of his old\r\ndetestation of that republic; for at midsummer, when he was in the\r\nfull career of his Italian conquests, he wrote to Faypoult, the French\r\nenvoy at Genoa, urging him to keep open certain cases that were in\r\ndispute, and three weeks later he again wrote that the time for Genoa\r\nhad not yet come. Any definite action against this wealthy city was,\r\nindeed, most undesirable during the campaign; for the bankers of\r\nGenoa supplied the French army with the sinews of war by means of\r\nsecret loans, and their merchants were equally complaisant in regard\r\nto provisions. These services were appreciated by Bonaparte as much as\r\nthey were resented by Nelson; and possibly the succour which Genoese\r\nmoney and shipping covertly rendered to the French expeditions for\r\nthe recovery of Corsica may have helped to efface from Bonaparte's\r\nmemory the associations clustering around the once-revered name of\r\nPaoli. From ill-concealed hostility he drifted into a position of\r\ntolerance and finally of friendship towards Genoa, provided that she\r\nbecame democratic. If her institutions could be assimilated to those\r\nof France, she might prove a valuable intermediary or ally.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the Genoese oligarchy presented no great\r\ndifficulties. Both Venice and Genoa had long outlived their power, and\r\nthe persistent violation of their neutrality had robbed them of that\r\nlast support of the weak, self-respect. The intrigues of Faypoult and\r\nSalicetti were undermining the influence of the Doge and Senate, when\r\nthe news of the fall of the Venetian oligarchy spurred on the French\r\nparty to action, But the Doge and Senate armed bands of mountaineers\r\nand fishermen who were hostile to change; and in a long and desperate\r\nconflict in the narrow streets of Genoa the democrats were completely\r\nworsted (May 23rd). The victors thereupon ransacked the houses of the\r\nopposing faction and found lists of names of those who were to have\r\nbeen proscribed, besides documents which revealed the complicity of\r\nthe French agents in the rising. Bonaparte was enraged at the folly of\r\nthe Genoese democrats, which deranged his plans. As he wrote to the\r\nDirectory, if they had only remained quiet for a fortnight, the\r\noligarchy would have collapsed from sheer weakness. The murder of a\r\nfew Frenchmen and Milanese now gave him an excuse for intervention. He\r\nsent an aide-de-camp, Lavalette, charged with a vehement diatribe\r\nagainst the Doge and Senate, which lost nothing in its recital before\r\nthat august body. At the close a few senators called out, \"Let us\r\nfight\": but the spirit of the Dorias flickered away with these\r\nprotests; and the degenerate scions of mighty sires submitted to the\r\ninsults of an aide-de-camp and the dictation of his master.\r\n\r\nThe fate of this ancient republic was decided by Bonaparte at the\r\nCastle of Montebello, near Milan, where he had already drawn up her\r\nfuture constitution. After brief conferences with the Genoese envoys,\r\nhe signed with them the secret convention which placed their\r\nrepublic--soon to be renamed the Ligurian Republic--under the\r\nprotection of France and substituted for the close patrician rule a\r\nmoderate democracy. The fact is significant. His military instincts\r\nhad now weaned him from the stiff Jacobinism of his youth; and, in\r\nconjunction with Faypoult and the envoys, he arranged that the\r\nlegislative powers should be intrusted to two popularly elected\r\nchambers of 300 and 150 members, while the executive functions were to\r\nbe discharged by twelve senators, presided over by a Doge; these\r\nofficers were to be appointed by the chambers: for the rest, the\r\nprinciples of religious liberty and civic equality were recognized,\r\nand local self-government was amply provided for. Cynics may, of\r\ncourse, object that this excellent constitution was but a means of\r\ninsuring French supremacy and of peacefully installing Bonaparte's\r\nregiments in a very important city; but the close of his intervention\r\nmay be pronounced as creditable to his judgment as its results were\r\nsalutary to Genoa. He even upbraided the demagogic party of that city\r\nfor shivering in pieces the statue of Andrea Doria and suspending the\r\nfragments on some of the innumerable trees of liberty recently\r\nplanted.\r\n\r\n     \"Andrea Doria,\" he wrote, \"was a great sailor and a great\r\n     statesman. Aristocracy was liberty in his time. The whole of Europe\r\n     envies your city the honour of having produced that celebrated man.\r\n     You will, I doubt not, take pains to rear his statue again: I pray\r\n     you to let me bear a part of the expense which that will entail,\r\n     which I desire to share with those who are most zealous for the\r\n     glory and welfare of your country.\"\r\n\r\nIn contrasting this wise and dignified conduct with the hatred which\r\nmost Corsicans still cherished against Genoa, Bonaparte's greatness of\r\nsoul becomes apparent and inspires the wish: _Utinam semper sic\r\nfuisses!_\r\n\r\nFew periods of his life have been more crowded with momentous events\r\nthan his sojourn at the Castle of Montebello in May-July, 1797.\r\nBesides completing the downfall of Venice and reinvigorating the life\r\nof Genoa, he was deeply concerned with the affairs of the Lombard or\r\nCisalpine Republic, with his family concerns, with the consolidation\r\nof his own power in French politics, and with the Austrian\r\nnegotiations. We will consider these affairs in the order here\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nThe future of Lombardy had long been a matter of concern to Bonaparte.\r\nHe knew that its people were the _fittest_ in all Italy to benefit by\r\n_constitutional rule_, but it must be dependent on France. He felt\r\nlittle confidence in the Lombards if left to themselves, as is seen in\r\nhis conversation with Melzi and Miot de Melito at the Castle of\r\nMontebello. He was in one of those humours, frequent at this time of\r\ndawning splendour, when confidence in his own genius betrayed him into\r\nquite piquant indiscretions. After referring to the Directory, he\r\nturned abruptly to Melzi, a Lombard nobleman:\r\n\r\n     \"As for your country, Monsieur de Melzi, it possesses still fewer\r\n     elements of republicanism than France, and can be managed more\r\n     easily than any other. You know better than anyone that we shall do\r\n     what we like with Italy. But the time has not yet come. We must\r\n     give way to the fever of the moment. We are going to have one or\r\n     two republics here of our own sort. Monge will arrange that for\r\n     us.\"\r\n\r\nHe had some reason for distrusting the strength of the democrats in\r\nItaly. At the close of 1796 he had written that there were three\r\nparties in Lombardy, one which accepted French guidance, another which\r\ndesired liberty even with some impatience, and a third faction,\r\nfriendly to the Austrians: he encouraged the first, checked the\r\nsecond, and repressed the last. He now complained that the Cispadanes\r\nand Cisalpines had behaved very badly in their first elections, which\r\nhad been conducted in his absence; for they had allowed clerical\r\ninfluence to override all French predilections. And, a little later,\r\nhe wrote to Talleyrand that the genuine love of liberty was feeble in\r\nItaly, and that, as soon as French influences were withdrawn, the\r\nItalian Jacobins would be murdered by the populace. The sequel was to\r\njustify his misgivings, and therefore to refute the charges of those\r\nwho see in his conduct respecting the Cisalpine Republic nothing but\r\ncalculating egotism. The difficulty of freeing a populace that had\r\nlearnt to hug its chains was so great that the temporary and partial\r\nsuccess which his new creation achieved may be regarded as a proof of\r\nhis political sagacity.\r\n\r\nAfter long preparations by four committees, which Bonaparte kept at\r\nMilan closely engaged in the drafting of laws, the constitution of the\r\nCisalpine Republic was completed. It was a miniature of that of\r\nFrance, and lest there should be any further mistakes in the\r\nelections, Bonaparte himself appointed, not only the five Directors\r\nand the Ministers whom they were to control, but even the 180\r\nlegislators, both Ancients and Juniors. In this strange fashion did\r\ndemocracy descend on Italy, not mainly as the work of the people, but\r\nat the behest of a great organizing genius. It is only fair to add\r\nthat he summoned to the work of civic reconstruction many of the best\r\nintellects of Italy. He appointed a noble, Serbelloni, to be the first\r\nPresident of the Cisalpine Republic, and a scion of the august House\r\nof the Visconti was sent as its ambassador to Paris. Many able men\r\nthat had left Lombardy during the Austrian occupation or the recent\r\nwars were attracted back by Bonaparte's politic clemency; and the\r\nfestival of July 9th at Milan, which graced the inauguration of the\r\nnew Government, presented a scene of civic joy to which that unhappy\r\nprovince had long been a stranger. A vast space was thronged with an\r\nenormous crowd which took up the words of the civic oath uttered by\r\nthe President. The Archbishop of Milan celebrated Mass and blessed the\r\nbanners of the National Guards; and the day closed with games, dances,\r\nand invocations to the memory of the Italians who had fought and died\r\nfor their nascent liberties. Amidst all the vivas and the clash of\r\nbells Bonaparte took care to sound a sterner note. On that very day\r\nhe ordered the suppression of a Milanese club which had indulged in\r\nJacobinical extravagances, and he called on the people \"to show to the\r\nworld by their wisdom, energy, and by the good organization of their\r\narmy, that modern Italy has not degenerated and is still worthy of\r\nliberty.\"\r\n\r\nThe contagion of Milanese enthusiasm spread rapidly. Some of the\r\nVenetian towns on the mainland now petitioned for union with the\r\nCisalpine Republic; and the deputies of the Cispadane, who were\r\npresent at the festival, urgently begged that their little State might\r\nenjoy the same privilege. Hitherto Bonaparte had refused these\r\nrequests, lest he should hamper the negotiations with Austria, which\r\nwere still tardily proceeding; but within a month their wish was\r\ngratified, and the Cispadane State was united to the larger and more\r\nvigorous republic north of the River Po, along with the important\r\ndistricts of Como, Bergamo, Brescia, Crema, and Peschiera.\r\nDisturbances in the Swiss district of the Valteline soon enabled\r\nBonaparte to intervene on behalf of the oppressed peasants, and to\r\nmerge this territory also in the Cisalpine Republic, which\r\nconsequently stretched from the high Alps southward to Rimini, and\r\nfrom the Ticino on the west to the Mincio on the east.[81]\r\n\r\nAlready, during his sojourn at the Castle of Montebello, Bonaparte\r\nfigured as the all-powerful proconsul of the French Republic. Indeed,\r\nall his surroundings--his retinue of complaisant generals, and the\r\nnumerous envoys and agents who thronged his ante-chambers to beg an\r\naudience--befitted a Sulla or a Wallenstein, rather than a general of\r\nthe regicide Republic. Three hundred Polish soldiers guarded the\r\napproaches to the castle; and semi-regal state was also observed in\r\nits spacious corridors and saloons. There were to be seen Italian\r\nnobles, literati, and artists, counting it the highest honour to visit\r\nthe liberator of their land; and to them Bonaparte behaved with that\r\nmixture of affability and inner reserve, of seductive charm\r\nalternating with incisive cross-examination which proclaimed at once\r\nthe versatility of his gifts, the keenness of his intellect, and his\r\ndetermination to gain social, as well as military and political,\r\nsupremacy. And yet the occasional abruptness of his movements, and the\r\nstrident tones of command lurking beneath his silkiest speech, now and\r\nagain reminded beholders that he was of the camp rather than of the\r\ncourt. To his generals he was distant; for any fault even his\r\nfavourite officers felt the full force of his anger; and aides-de-camp\r\nwere not often invited to dine at his table. Indeed, he frequently\r\ndined before his retinue, almost in the custom of the old Kings of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nWith him was his mother, also his brothers, Joseph and Louis, whom he\r\nwas rapidly advancing to fortune. There, too, were his sisters; Elise,\r\nproud and self-contained, who at this period married a noble but\r\nsomewhat boorish Corsican, Bacciocchi; and Pauline, a charming girl of\r\nsixteen, whose hand the all-powerful brother offered to Marmont, to be\r\nby him unaccountably refused, owing, it would seem, to a prior\r\nattachment. This lively and luxurious young creature was not long to\r\nremain unwedded. The adjutant-general, Leclerc, became her suitor;\r\nand, despite his obscure birth and meagre talents, speedily gained her\r\nas his bride. Bonaparte granted her 40,000 francs as her dowry;\r\nand--significant fact--the nuptials were privately blessed by a priest\r\nin the chapel of the Palace of Montebello.\r\n\r\nThere, too, at Montebello was Josephine.\r\n\r\nCertainly the Bonapartes were not happy in their loves: the one dark\r\nside to the young conqueror's life, all through this brilliant\r\ncampaign, was the cruelty of his bride. From her side he had in March,\r\n1796, torn himself away, distracted between his almost insane love for\r\nher and his determination to crush the chief enemy of France: to her\r\nhe had written long and tender letters even amidst the superhuman\r\nactivities of his campaign. Ten long despatches a day had not\r\nprevented him covering as many sheets of paper with protestations of\r\ndevotion to her and with entreaties that she would likewise pour out\r\nher heart to him. Then came complaints, some tenderly pleading, others\r\npassionately bitter, of her cruelly rare and meagre replies. The sad\r\ntruth, that Josephine cares much for his fame and little for him\r\nhimself, that she delays coming to Italy, these and other afflicting\r\ndetails rend his heart. At last she comes to Milan, after a\r\npassionate outburst of weeping--at leaving her beloved Paris. In Italy\r\nshe shows herself scarcely more than affectionate to her doting\r\nspouse. Marlborough's letters to his peevish duchess during the\r\nBlenheim campaign are not more crowded with maudlin curiosities than\r\nthose of the fierce scourge of the Austrians to his heartless fair. He\r\nwrites to her agonizingly, begging her to be less lovely, less\r\ngracious, less good--apparently in order that he may love her less\r\nmadly: but she is never to be jealous, and, above all, never to weep:\r\nfor her tears burn his blood: and he concludes by sending millions of\r\nkisses, and also to her dog! And this mad effusion came from the man\r\nwhom the outside world took to be of steel-like coldness: yet his\r\nnature had this fevered, passionate side, just as the moon, where she\r\nfaces the outer void, is compact of ice, but turns a front of molten\r\ngranite to her blinding, all-compelling luminary.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly this blazing passion helped to spur on the lover to that\r\nterrific energy which makes the Italian campaign unique even amidst\r\nthe Napoleonic wars. Beaulieu, Würmser, and Alvintzy were not rivals\r\nin war; they were tiresome hindrances to his unsated love. On the eve\r\nof one of his greatest triumphs he penned to her the following\r\nrhapsody:\r\n\r\n     \"I am far from you, I seem to be surrounded by the blackest night:\r\n     I need the lurid light of the thunder-bolts which we are about to\r\n     hurl on our enemies to dispel the darkness into which your absence\r\n     has plunged me. Josephine, you wept when we parted: you wept! At\r\n     that thought all my being trembles. But be consoled! Würmser shall\r\n     pay dearly for the tears which I have seen you shed.\"\r\n\r\nWhat infatuation! to appease a woman's fancied grief, he will pile\r\nhigh the plains of Mincio with corpses, recking not of the thousand\r\nhomes where bitter tears will flow. It is the apotheosis of\r\nsentimental egotism and social callousness. And yet this brain, with\r\nits moral vision hopelessly blurred, judged unerringly in its own\r\npeculiar plane. What power it must have possessed, that, unexhausted\r\nby the flames of love, it grasped infallibly the myriad problems of\r\nwar, scanning them the more clearly, perchance, in the white heat of\r\nits own passion.\r\n\r\nAt last there came the time of fruition at Montebello: of fruition,\r\nbut not of ease or full contentment; for not only did an average of\r\neight despatches a day claim several hours, during which he jealously\r\nguarded his solitude; but Josephine's behaviour served to damp his\r\nardour. As, during the time of absence, she had slighted his urgent\r\nentreaties for a daily letter, so too, during the sojourn at\r\nMontebello, she revealed the shallowness and frivolity of her being.\r\nFêtes, balls, and receptions, provided they were enlivened by a light\r\ncrackle of compliments from an admiring circle, pleased her more than\r\nthe devotion of a genius. She had admitted, before marriage, that her\r\n\"Creole _nonchalance_\" shrank wearily away from his keen and ardent\r\nnature; and now, when torn away from the _salons_ of Paris, she seems\r\nto have taken refuge in entertainments and lap-dogs.[82] Doubtless\r\neven at this period Josephine evinced something of that warm feeling\r\nwhich deepened with ripening years and lit up her later sorrows with a\r\nmild radiance; but her recent association with Madame Tallien and that\r\ngiddy _cohue_ had accentuated her habits of feline complaisance to all\r\nand sundry. Her facile fondnesses certainly welled forth far too\r\nwidely to carve out a single channel of love and mingle with the deep\r\ntorrent of Bonaparte's early passion. In time, therefore, his\r\naffections strayed into many other courses; and it would seen that\r\neven in the later part of this Italian epoch his conduct was\r\nirregular. For this Josephine had herself mainly to thank. At last she\r\nawakened to the real value and greatness of the love which her neglect\r\nhad served to dull and tarnish, but then it was too late for complete\r\nreunion of souls: the Corsican eagle had by that time soared far\r\nbeyond reach of her highest flutterings.[83]\r\n\r\nAt Montebello, as also at Passeriano, whither the Austrian\r\nnegotiations were soon transferred, Bonaparte, though strictly\r\nmaintaining the ceremonies of his proconsular court, yet showed the\r\nwarmth of his social instincts. After the receptions of the day and\r\nthe semi-public dinner, he loved to unbend in the evening. Sometimes,\r\nwhen Josephine formed a party of ladies for _vingt-et-un_, he would\r\nwithdraw to a corner and indulge in the game of _goose_; and\r\nbystanders noted with amusement that his love of success led him to\r\nplay tricks and cheat in order not to \"fall into the pit.\" At other\r\ntimes, if the conversation languished, he proposed that each person\r\nshould tell a story; and when no Boccaccio-like facility inspired the\r\ncompany, he sometimes launched out into one of those eerie and\r\nthrilling recitals, such as he must often have heard from the\r\n_improvisatori_ of his native island. Bourrienne states that\r\nBonaparte's realism required darkness and daggers for the full display\r\nof his gifts, and that the climax of his dramatic monologue was not\r\nseldom enhanced by the screams of the ladies, a consummation which\r\ngratified rather than perturbed the accomplished actor.\r\n\r\nA survey of Bonaparte's multifarious activity in Italy enables the\r\nreader to realize something of the wonder and awe excited by his\r\nachievements. Like an Athena he leaped forth from the Revolution,\r\nfully armed for every kind of contest. His mental superiority\r\nimpressed diplomats as his strategy baffled the Imperialist generals;\r\nand now he was to give further proofs of his astuteness by\r\nintervening in the internal affairs of France.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand Bonaparte's share in the _coup d'état_ of\r\nFructidor, we must briefly review the course of political events at\r\nParis. At the time of the installation of the Directory the hope was\r\nwidely cherished that the Revolution was now entirely a thing of the\r\npast. But the unrest of the time was seen in the renewal of the\r\nroyalist revolts in the west, and in the communistic plot of Babeuf\r\nfor the overthrow of the whole existing system of private property.\r\nThe aims of these desperadoes were revealed by an accomplice; the\r\nringleaders were arrested, and after a long trial Babeuf was\r\nguillotined and his confederates were transported (May, 1797). The\r\ndisclosure of these ultra-revolutionary aims shocked not only the\r\nbourgeois, but even the peasants who were settled on the confiscated\r\nlands of the nobles and clergy. The very class which had given to the\r\nevents of 1789 their irresistible momentum was now inclined to rest\r\nand be thankful; and in this swift revulsion of popular feeling the\r\nroyalists began to gain ground. The elections for the renewal of a\r\nthird part of the Councils resulted in large gains for them, and they\r\ncould therefore somewhat influence the composition of the Directory by\r\nelecting Barthélemy, a constitutional royalist. Still, he could not\r\noverbear the other four regicide Directors, even though one of these,\r\nCarnot, also favoured moderate opinions more and more. A crisis\r\ntherefore rapidly developed between the still Jacobinical Directory\r\nand the two legislative Councils, in each of which the royalists, or\r\nmoderates, had the upper hand. The aim of this majority was to\r\nstrengthen the royalist elements in France by the repeal of many\r\nrevolutionary laws. Their man of action was Pichegru, the conqueror of\r\nHolland, who, abjuring Jacobinism, now schemed with a club of\r\nroyalists, which met at Clichy, on the outskirts of Paris. That their\r\nintrigues aimed at the restoration of the Bourbons had recently been\r\nproved. The French agents in Venice seized the Comte d'Entraigues, the\r\nconfidante of the _soi-disant_ Louis XVIII.; and his papers, when\r\nopened by Bonaparte, Clarke, and Berthier at Montebello, proved that\r\nthere was a conspiracy in France for the recall of the Bourbons. With\r\ncharacteristic skill, Bonaparte held back these papers from the\r\nDirectory until he had mastered the difficulties of the situation. As\r\nfor the count, he released him; and in return for this signal act of\r\nclemency, then very unusual towards an _émigré_, he soon became the\r\nobject of his misrepresentation and slander.\r\n\r\nThe political crisis became acute in July, when the majority\r\nof the Councils sought to force on the Directory Ministers who\r\nwould favour moderate or royalist aims. Three Directors, Barras, La\r\nRéveillière-Lépeaux, and Rewbell, refused to listen to these behests,\r\nand insisted on the appointment of Jacobinical Ministers even in the\r\nteeth of a majority of the Councils. This defiance of the deputies of\r\nFrance was received with execration by most civilians, but with\r\njubilant acclaim by the armies; for the soldiery, far removed from the\r\npartisan strifes of the capital, still retained their strongly\r\nrepublican opinions. The news that their conduct towards Venice was\r\nbeing sharply criticised by the moderates in Paris aroused their\r\nstrongest feelings, military pride and democratic ardour.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Bonaparte's conduct was eminently cautious and reserved.\r\nIn the month of May he sent to Paris his most trusted aide-de-camp,\r\nLavalette, instructing him to sound all parties, to hold aloof from\r\nall engagements, and to report to him dispassionately on the state of\r\npublic opinion.[84] Lavalette judged the position of the Directory, or\r\nrather of the Triumvirate which swayed it, to be so precarious that he\r\ncautioned his chief against any definite espousal of its cause; and in\r\nJune-July, 1797, Bonaparte almost ceased to correspond with the\r\nDirectors except on Italian affairs, probably because he looked\r\nforward to their overthrow as an important step towards his own\r\nsupremacy. There was, however, the possibility of a royalist reaction\r\nsweeping all before it in France and ranging the armies against the\r\ncivil power. He therefore waited and watched, fully aware of the\r\nenhanced importance which an uncertain situation gives to the outsider\r\nwho refuses to show his hand.\r\n\r\nDuller eyes than his had discerned that the constitutional conflict\r\nbetween the Directory and the Councils could not be peaceably\r\nadjusted. The framers of the constitution had designed the slowly\r\nchanging Directory as a check on the Councils, which were renewed to\r\nthe extent of one-third every year; but, while seeking to put a\r\nregicide drag on the parliamentary coach, they had omitted to provide\r\nagainst a complete overturn. The Councils could not legally override\r\nthe Directory; neither could the Directory veto the decrees of the\r\nCouncils, nor, by dissolving them, compel an appeal to the country.\r\nThis defect in the constitution had been clearly pointed out by\r\nNecker, and it now drew from Barras the lament:\r\n\r\n     \"Ah, if the constitution of the Year III., which offers so many\r\n     sage precautions, had not neglected one of the most important; if\r\n     it had foreseen that the two great powers of the State, engaged in\r\n     heated debates, must end with open conflicts, when there is no high\r\n     court of appeal to arrange them; if it had sufficiently armed the\r\n     Directory with the right of dissolving the Chamber!\"[85]\r\n\r\nAs it was, the knot had to be severed by the sword: not, as yet, by\r\nBonaparte's trenchant blade: he carefully drew back; but where as yet\r\nhe feared to tread, Hoche rushed in. This ardently republican general\r\nwas inspired by a self-denying patriotism, that flinched not before\r\nodious duties. While Bonaparte was culling laurels in Northern Italy,\r\nHoche was undertaking the most necessary task of quelling the Vendéan\r\nrisings, and later on braved the fogs and storms of the Atlantic in\r\nthe hope of rousing all Ireland in revolt. His expedition to Bantry\r\nBay in December, 1796, having miscarried, he was sent into the\r\nRhineland. The conclusion of peace by Bonaparte at Leoben again dashed\r\nhis hopes, and he therefore received with joy the orders of the\r\nDirectory that he should march a large part of his army to Brest for a\r\nsecond expedition to Ireland. The Directory, however, intended to use\r\nthose troops nearer home, and appointed him Minister of War (July\r\n16th). The choice was a good one; Hoche was active, able, and popular\r\nwith the soldiery; but he had not yet reached the thirtieth year of\r\nhis age, the limit required by the constitution. On this technical\r\ndefect the majority of the Councils at once fastened; and their\r\ncomplaints were redoubled when a large detachment of his troops came\r\nwithin the distance of the capital forbidden to the army. The\r\nmoderates could therefore accuse the triumvirs and Hoche of conspiracy\r\nagainst the laws; he speedily resigned the Ministry (July 22nd), and\r\nwithdrew his troops into Champagne, and finally to the Rhineland.\r\n\r\nNow was the opportunity for Bonaparte to take up the _rôle_ of\r\nCromwell which Hoche had so awkwardly played. And how skilfully the\r\nconqueror of Italy plays it--through subordinates. He was too well\r\nversed in statecraft to let his sword flash before the public gaze. By\r\nthis time he had decided to act, and doubtless the fervid Jacobinism\r\nof the soldiery was the chief cause determining his action. At the\r\nnational celebration on July 14th he allowed it to have free vent, and\r\nthereupon wrote to the Directory, bitterly reproaching them for their\r\nweakness in face of the royalist plot: \"I see that the Clichy Club\r\nmeans to march over my corpse to the destruction of the Republic.\" He\r\nended the diatribe by his usual device, when he desired to remind the\r\nGovernment of his necessity to them, of offering his resignation, in\r\ncase they refused to take vigorous measures against the malcontents.\r\nYet even now his action was secret and indirect. On July 27th he sent\r\nto the Directors a brief note stating that Augereau had requested\r\nleave to go to Paris, \"where his affairs call him\"; and that he sent\r\nby this general the originals of the addresses of the army, avowing\r\nits devotion to the constitution. No one would suspect from this that\r\nAugereau was in Bonaparte's confidence and came to carry out the\r\n_coup d'état_. The secret was well preserved. Lavalette was\r\nBonaparte's official representative; and his neutrality was now\r\nmaintained in accordance with a note received from his chief:\r\n\"Augereau is coming to Paris: do not put yourself in his power: he has\r\nsown disorder in the army: he is a factious man.\"\r\n\r\nBut, while Lavalette was left to trim his sails as best he might,\r\nAugereau was certain to act with energy. Bonaparte knew well that his\r\nJacobinical lieutenant, famed as the first swordsman of the day, and\r\nthe leader of the fighting division of the army, would do his work\r\nthoroughly, always vaunting his own prowess and decrying that of his\r\ncommander. It was so. Augereau rushed to Paris, breathing threats of\r\nslaughter against the royalists. Checked for a time by the calculating\r\n_finesse_ of the triumvirs, he prepared to end matters by a single\r\nblow; and, when the time had come, he occupied the strategic points of\r\nthe capital, drew a cordon of troops round the Tuileries, where the\r\nCouncils sat, invaded the chambers of deputies and consigned to the\r\nTemple the royalists and moderates there present, with their leader,\r\nPichegru. Barthélemy was also seized; but Carnot, warned by a friend,\r\nfled during the early hours of this eventful day--September 4th (or 18\r\nFructidor). The mutilated Councils forthwith annulled the late\r\nelections in forty-nine Departments, and passed severe laws against\r\northodox priests and the unpardoned _émigrés_ who had ventured to\r\nreturn to France. The Directory was also intrusted with complete power\r\nto suppress newspapers, to close political clubs, and to declare any\r\ncommune in a state of siege. Its functions were now wellnigh as\r\nextensive and absolute as those of the Committee of Public Safety, its\r\npowers being limited only by the incompetence of the individual\r\nDirectors and by their paralyzing consciousness that they ruled only\r\nby favour of the army. They had taken the sword to solve a political\r\nproblem: two years later they were to fall by that sword.[86]\r\n\r\nAugereau fully expected that he would be one of the two Directors who\r\nwere elected in place of Carnot and Barthélemy; but the Councils had\r\nno higher opinion of his civic capacity than Bonaparte had formed;\r\nand, to his great disgust, Merlin of Douai and François of Neufchâtel\r\nwere chosen. The last scenes of the _coup d'état_ centred around the\r\ntransportation of the condemned deputies. One of the early memories of\r\nthe future Duc de Broglie recalled the sight of the \"_députés\r\nfructidorisés_ travelling in closed carriages, railed up like cages,\"\r\nto the seaport whence they were to sail to the lingering agonies of a\r\ntropical prison in French Guiana.\r\n\r\nIt was a painful spectacle: \"the indignation was great, but the\r\nconsternation was greater still. Everybody foresaw the renewal of the\r\nReign of Terror and resignedly prepared for it.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the feelings, even of those who, like Madame de Staël and\r\nher friend Benjamin Constant, had declared before the _coup d'état_\r\nthat it was necessary to the salvation of the Republic. That\r\naccomplished woman was endowed with nearly every attribute of genius\r\nexcept political foresight and self-restraint. No sooner had the blow\r\nbeen dealt than she fell to deploring its results, which any\r\nfourth-rate intelligence might have foreseen. \"Liberty was the only\r\npower really conquered\"--such was her later judgment on Fructidor. Now\r\nthat Liberty fled affrighted, the errant enthusiasms of the gifted\r\nauthoress clung for a brief space to Bonaparte. Her eulogies on his\r\nexploits, says Lavalette, who listened to her through a dinner in\r\nTalleyrand's rooms, possessed all the mad disorder and exaggeration of\r\ninspiration; and, after the repast was over, the votaress refused to\r\npass out before an aide-de-camp of Bonaparte! The incident is\r\ncharacteristic both of Madame de Staël's moods and of the whims of the\r\npopulace. Amidst the disenchantments of that time, when the pursuit of\r\nliberty seemed but an idle quest, when royalists were the champions of\r\nparliamentary rule and republicans relied on military force, all eyes\r\nturned wearily away from the civic broils at Paris to the visions of\r\nsplendour revealed by the conqueror of Italy. Few persons knew how\r\nlargely their new favourite was responsible for the events of\r\nFructidor; all of them had by heart the names of his victories; and\r\nhis popularity flamed to the skies when he recrossed the Alps,\r\nbringing with him a lucrative peace with Austria.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations with that Power had dragged on slowly through the\r\nwhole summer and far into the autumn, mainly owing to the hopes of the\r\nEmperor Francis that the disorder in France would filch from her the\r\nmeed of victory. Doubtless that would have been the case, had not\r\nBonaparte, while striking down the royalists at Paris through his\r\nlieutenant, remained at the head of his victorious legions in Venetia\r\nready again to invade Austria, if occasion should arise.\r\n\r\nIn some respects, the _coup d'état_ of Fructidor helped on the\r\nprogress of the negotiations. That event postponed, if it did not\r\nrender impossible, the advent of civil war in France; and, like\r\nPride's Purge in our civil strifes, it installed in power a Government\r\nwhich represented the feelings of the army and of its chief. Moreover,\r\nit rid him of the presence of Clarke, his former colleague in the\r\nnegotiations, whose relations with Carnot aroused the suspicions of\r\nBarras and led to his recall. Bonaparte was now the sole\r\nplenipotentiary of France. The final negotiations with Austria and the\r\nresulting treaty of Campo Formio may therefore be considered as almost\r\nentirely his handiwork.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, at this very time, the head of the Foreign Office at Paris\r\nwas a man destined to achieve the greatest diplomatic reputation of\r\nthe age. Charles Maurice de Talleyrand seemed destined for the task of\r\nuniting the society of the old _régime_ with the France of the\r\nRevolution. To review his life would be to review the Revolution. With\r\na reforming zeal begotten of his own intellectual acuteness and of\r\nresentment against his family, which had disinherited him for the\r\ncrime of lameness, he had led the first assaults of 1789 against the\r\nprivileges of the nobles and of the clerics among whom his lot had\r\nperforce been cast. He acted as the head of the new \"constitutional\"\r\nclergy, and bestowed his episcopal blessing at the Feast of Pikes in\r\n1790; but, owing to his moderation, he soon fell into disfavour with\r\nthe extreme men who seized on power. After a sojourn in England and\r\nthe United States, he came back to France, and on the suggestion of\r\nMadame de Staël was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs (July,\r\n1797). To this post he brought the highest gifts: his early clerical\r\ntraining gave a keen edge to an intellect naturally subtle and\r\npenetrating: his intercourse with Mirabeau gave him a grip on the\r\nessentials of sound policy and diplomacy: his sojourn abroad widened\r\nhis vision, and imbued him with an admiration for English institutions\r\nand English moderation. Yet he loved France with a deep and fervent\r\nlove. For her he schemed; for her he threw over friends or foes with a\r\nMachiavellian facility. Amidst all the glamour of the Napoleonic\r\nEmpire he discerned the dangers that threatened France; and he warned\r\nhis master--as uselessly as he warned reckless nobles, priestly\r\nbigots, and fanatical Jacobins in the past, or the unteachable zealots\r\nof the restored monarchy. His life, when viewed, not in regard to its\r\nmany sordid details, but to its chief guiding principle, was one long\r\ncampaign against French _élan_ and partisan obstinacy; and he sealed\r\nit with the quaint declaration in his will that, on reviewing his\r\ncareer, he found he had never abandoned a party before it had\r\nabandoned itself. Talleyrand was equipped with a diversity of gifts:\r\nhis gaze, intellectual yet composed, blenched not when he uttered a\r\nscathing criticism or a diplomatic lie: his deep and penetrating voice\r\ngave force to all his words, and the curl of his lip or the scornful\r\nlifting of his eyebrows sometimes disconcerted an opponent more than\r\nhis biting sarcasm. In brief, this disinherited noble, this unfrocked\r\npriest, this disenchanted Liberal, was the complete expression of the\r\ninimitable society of the old _régime_, when quickened intellectually\r\nby Voltaire and dulled by the Terror. After doing much to destroy the\r\nold society, he was now to take a prominent share in its\r\nreconstruction on a modern basis.[87]\r\n\r\nSuch was the man who now commenced his chief life-work, the task of\r\nguiding Napoleon. \"The mere name of Bonaparte is an aid which ought to\r\nsmooth away all my difficulties\"--these were the obsequious terms in\r\nwhich he began his correspondence with the great general. In reality,\r\nhe distrusted him; but whether from diffidence, or from the weakness\r\nof his own position, which as yet was little more than that of\r\nthe head clerk of his department, he did nothing to assert the\r\npredominance of civil over military influence in the negotiations now\r\nproceeding.\r\n\r\nTwo months before Talleyrand accepted office, Bonaparte had enlarged\r\nhis original demands on Austria, and claimed for France the whole of\r\nthe lands on the left or west bank of the Rhine, and for the Cisalpine\r\nRepublic all the territory up to the River Adige. To these demands the\r\nCourt of Vienna offered a tenacious resistance which greatly irritated\r\nhim. \"These people are so slow,\" he exclaimed, \"they think that a\r\npeace like this ought to be meditated upon for three years first.\"\r\n\r\nConcurrently with the Franco-Austrian negotiations, overtures for a\r\npeace between France and England were being discussed at Lille. Into\r\nthese it is impossible to enter farther than to notice that in these\r\nefforts Pitt and the other British Ministers (except Grenville) were\r\nsincerely desirous of peace, and that negotiations broke down owing to\r\nthe masterful tone adopted by the Directory. It was perhaps\r\nunfortunate that Lord Malmesbury was selected as the English\r\nnegotiator, for his behaviour in the previous year had been construed\r\nby the French as dilatory and insincere. But the Directors may on\r\nbetter evidence be charged with postponing a settlement until they\r\nhad struck down their foes within France. Bonaparte's letters at this\r\ntime show that he hoped for the conclusion of a peace with England,\r\ndoubtless in order that his own pressure on Austria might be\r\nredoubled. In this he was to be disappointed. After Fructidor the\r\nDirectory assumed overweening airs. Talleyrand was bidden to enjoin on\r\nthe French plenipotentiaries the adoption of a loftier tone. Maret,\r\nthe French envoy at Lille, whose counsels had ever been on the side of\r\nmoderation, was abruptly replaced by a \"Fructidorian\"; and a decisive\r\nrefusal was given to the English demand for the retention of Trinidad\r\nand the Cape, at the expense of Spain and the Batavian Republic\r\nrespectively. Indeed, the Directory intended to press for the cession\r\nof the Channel Islands to France and of Gibraltar to Spain, and that,\r\ntoo, at the end of a maritime war fruitful in victories for the Union\r\nJack.[88]\r\n\r\nTowards the King of Sardinia the new Directory was equally imperious.\r\nThe throne of Turin was now occupied by Charles Emmanuel IV. He\r\nsucceeded to a troublous heritage. Threatened by democratic republics\r\nat Milan and Genoa, and still more by the effervescence of his own\r\nsubjects, he strove to gain an offensive and defensive alliance with\r\nFrance, as the sole safeguard against revolution. To this end he\r\noffered 10,000 Piedmontese for service with Bonaparte, and even\r\nsecretly covenanted to cede the island of Sardinia to France. But\r\nthese offers could not divert Barras and his colleagues from their\r\nrevolutionary policy. They spurned the alliance with the House of\r\nSavoy, and, despite the remonstrances of Bonaparte, they fomented\r\ncivil discords in Piedmont such as endangered his communications with\r\nFrance. Indeed, the Directory after Fructidor was deeply imbued with\r\nfear of their commander in Italy. To increase his difficulties was\r\nnow their paramount desire; and under the pretext of extending liberty\r\nin Italy, they instructed Talleyrand to insist on the inclusion of\r\nVenice and Friuli in the Cisalpine Republic. Austria must be content\r\nwith Trieste, Istria, and Dalmatia, must renounce all interest in the\r\nfate of the Ionian Isles, and find in Germany all compensation for her\r\nlosses in Italy. Such was the ultimatum of the Directory (September\r\n16th). But a loophole of escape was left to Bonaparte; the conduct of\r\nthese negotiations was confided solely to him, and he had already\r\ndecided their general tenor by giving his provisional assent to the\r\nacquisition by Austria of the east bank of the Adige and the city of\r\nVenice. From these terms he was disinclined to diverge. He was weary\r\nof \"this old Europe\": his gaze was directed towards Corfu, Malta, and\r\nEgypt; and when he received the official ultimatum, he saw that the\r\nDirectory desired a renewal of the war under conditions highly\r\nembarrassing for him. \"Yes: I see clearly that they are preparing\r\ndefeats for me,\" he exclaimed to his aide-de-camp Lavalette. They\r\nangered him still more when, on the death of Hoche, they intrusted\r\ntheir Rhenish forces, numbering 120,000 men, to the command of\r\nAugereau, and sent to the Army of Italy an officer bearing a manifesto\r\nwritten by Augereau concerning Fructidor, which set forth the anxiety\r\nfelt by the Directors concerning Bonaparte's political views. At this\r\nBonaparte fired up and again offered his resignation (September 25th):\r\n\r\n     \"No power on earth shall, after this horrible and most unexpected\r\n     act of ingratitude by the Government, make me continue to serve it.\r\n     My health imperiously demands calm and repose.... My recompense is\r\n     in my conscience and in the opinion of posterity. Believe me, that\r\n     at any time of danger, I shall be the first to defend the\r\n     Constitution of the Year III.\"\r\n\r\nThe resignation was of course declined, in terms most flattering to\r\nBonaparte; and the Directors prepared to ratify the treaty with\r\nSardinia.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the fit of passion once passed, the determination to dominate\r\nevents again possessed him, and he decided to make peace, despite the\r\nrecent instructions of the Directory that no peace would be honourable\r\nwhich sacrificed Venice to Austria. There is reason to believe that he\r\nnow regretted this sacrifice. His passionate outbursts against Venice\r\nafter the _Pâques véronaises_, his denunciations of \"that fierce and\r\nbloodstained rule,\" had now given place to some feelings of pity for\r\nthe people whose ruin he had so artfully compassed; and the social\r\nintercourse with Venetians which he enjoyed at Passeriano, the castle\r\nof the Doge Manin, may well have inspired some regard for the proud\r\ncity which he was now about to barter away to Austria. Only so,\r\nhowever, could he peacefully terminate the wearisome negotiations with\r\nthe Emperor. The Austrian envoy, Count Cobenzl, struggled hard to gain\r\nthe whole of Venetia, and the Legations, along with the half of\r\nLombardy.[89] From these exorbitant demands he was driven by the\r\npersistent vigour of Bonaparte's assaults. The little Corsican proved\r\nhimself an expert in diplomatic wiles, now enticing the Imperialist on\r\nto slippery ground, and occasionally shocking him by calculated\r\noutbursts of indignation or bravado. After many days spent in\r\nintellectual fencing, the discussions were narrowed down to Mainz,\r\nMantua, Venice, and the Ionian Isles. On the fate of these islands a\r\nstormy discussion arose, Cobenzl stipulating for their complete\r\nindependence, while Bonaparte passionately claimed them for France. In\r\none of these sallies his vehement gestures overturned a cabinet with a\r\ncostly vase; but the story that he smashed the vase, as a sign of his\r\npower to crush the House of Austria, is a later refinement on the\r\nincident, about which Cobenzl merely reported to Vienna--\"He behaved\r\nlike a fool.\" Probably his dextrous disclosure of the severe terms\r\nwhich the Directory ordered him to extort was far more effective than\r\nthis boisterous _gasconnade_. Finally, after threatening an immediate\r\nattack on the Austrian positions, he succeeded on three of the\r\nquestions above named, but at the sacrifice of Venice to Austria.\r\n\r\nThe treaty was signed on October 17th at the village of Campo Formio.\r\nThe published articles may be thus summarized: Austria ceded to the\r\nFrench Republic her Belgic provinces. Of the once extensive Venetian\r\npossessions France gained the Ionian Isles, while Austria acquired\r\nIstria, Dalmatia, the districts at the mouth of the Cattaro, the city\r\nof Venice, and the mainland of Venetia as far west as Lake Garda, the\r\nAdige, and the lower part of the River Po. The Hapsburgs recognized\r\nthe independence of the now enlarged Cisalpine Republic. France and\r\nAustria agreed to frame a treaty of commerce on the basis of \"the most\r\nfavoured nation.\" The Emperor ceded to the dispossessed Duke of Modena\r\nthe territory of Breisgau on the east of the Rhine. A congress was to\r\nbe held at Rastadt, at which the plenipotentiaries of France and of\r\nthe Germanic Empire were to regulate affairs between these two Powers.\r\n\r\nSecret articles bound the Emperor to use his influence in the Empire\r\nto secure for France the left bank of the Rhine; while France was to\r\nuse her good offices to procure for the Emperor the Archbishopric of\r\nSalzburg and the Bavarian land between that State and the River Inn.\r\nOther secret articles referred to the indemnities which were to be\r\nfound in Germany for some of the potentates who suffered by the\r\nchanges announced in the public treaty.\r\n\r\nThe bartering away of Venice awakened profound indignation. After more\r\nthan a thousand years of independence, that city was abandoned to the\r\nEmperor by the very general who had promised to free Italy. It was in\r\nvain that Bonaparte strove to soothe the provisional government of\r\nthat city through the influence of a Venetian Jew, who, after his\r\nconversion, had taken the famous name of Dandolo. Summoning him to\r\nPasseriano, he explained to him the hard necessity which now dictated\r\nthe transfer of Venice to Austria. France could not now shed any more\r\nof her best blood for what was, after all, only \"a moral cause\": the\r\nVenetians therefore must cultivate resignation for the present and\r\nhope for the future.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CENTRAL EUROPE AFTER THE PEACE OF CAMPO FORMIO, 1797\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire are indicated by thick dots.\r\nThe Austrian Dominions are indicated by vertical lines. The Prussian\r\nDominions are indicated by horizontal lines. The Ecclesiastical\r\nStates are indicated by dotted areas.]\r\n\r\nThe advice was useless. The Venetian democrats determined on a last\r\ndesperate venture. They secretly sent three deputies, among them\r\nDandolo, with a large sum of money wherewith to bribe the Directors to\r\nreject the treaty of Campo Formio. This would have been quite\r\npracticable, had not their errand become known to Bonaparte. Alarmed\r\nand enraged at this device, which, if successful, would have consigned\r\nhim to infamy, he sent Duroc in chase; and the envoys, caught before\r\nthey crossed the Maritime Alps, were brought before the general at\r\nMilan. To his vehement reproaches and threats they opposed a dignified\r\nsilence, until Dandolo, appealing to his generosity, awakened those\r\nnobler feelings which were never long dormant. Then he quietly\r\ndismissed them--to witness the downfall of their beloved city.\r\n\r\n_Acribus initiis, ut ferme talia, incuriosa fine_; these cynical\r\nwords, with which the historian of the Roman Empire blasted the\r\nmovements of his age, may almost serve as the epitaph to Bonaparte's\r\nearly enthusiasms. Proclaiming at the beginning of his Italian\r\ncampaigns that he came to free Italy, he yet finished his course of\r\nalmost unbroken triumphs by a surrender which his panegyrists have\r\nscarcely attempted to condone. But the fate of Venice was almost\r\nforgotten amidst the jubilant acclaim which greeted the conqueror of\r\nItaly on his arrival at Paris. All France rang with the praises of the\r\nhero who had spread liberty throughout Northern and Central Italy,\r\nhad enriched the museums of Paris with priceless masterpieces of art,\r\nwhose army had captured 150,000 prisoners, and had triumphed in 18\r\npitched battles--for Caldiero was now reckoned as a French\r\nvictory--and 47 smaller engagements. The Directors, shrouding their\r\nhatred and fear of the masterful proconsul under their Roman togas,\r\ngreeted him with uneasy effusiveness. The climax of the official\r\ncomedy was reached when, at the reception of the conqueror, Barras,\r\npointing northwards, exclaimed: \"Go there and capture the giant\r\ncorsair that infests the seas: go punish in London outrages that have\r\ntoo long been unpunished\": whereupon, as if overcome by his emotions,\r\nhe embraced the general. Amidst similar attentions bestowed by the\r\nother Directors, the curtain falls on the first, or Italian, act of\r\nthe young hero's career, soon to rise on oriental adventures that were\r\nto recall the exploits of Alexander.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nEGYPT\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many misconceptions of the French revolutionists none was\r\nmore insidious than the notion that the wealth and power of the\r\nBritish people rested on an artificial basis. This mistaken belief in\r\nEngland's weakness arose out of the doctrine taught by the\r\n_Economistes_ or _Physiocrates_ in the latter half of last century,\r\nthat commerce was not of itself productive of wealth, since it only\r\npromoted the distribution of the products of the earth; but that\r\nagriculture was the sole source of true wealth and prosperity. They\r\ntherefore exalted agriculture at the expense of commerce and\r\nmanufactures, and the course of the Revolution, which turned largely\r\non agrarian questions, tended in the same direction. Robespierre and\r\nSt. Just were never weary of contrasting the virtues of a simple\r\npastoral life with the corruptions and weakness engendered by foreign\r\ncommerce; and when, early in 1793, Jacobinical zeal embroiled the\r\nyoung Republic with England, the orators of the Convention confidently\r\nprophesied the downfall of the modern Carthage. Kersaint declared that\r\n\"the credit of England rests upon fictitious wealth: ... bounded in\r\nterritory, the public future of England is found almost wholly in its\r\nbank, and this edifice is entirely supported by naval commerce. It is\r\neasy to cripple this commerce, and especially so for a power like\r\nFrance, which stands alone on her own riches.\"[90]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommercial interests played a foremost part all through the struggle.\r\nThe official correspondence of Talleyrand in 1797 proves that the\r\nDirectory intended to claim the Channel Islands, the north of\r\nNewfoundland, and all our conquests in the East Indies made since\r\n1754, besides the restitution of Gibraltar to Spain.[91] Nor did these\r\nhopes seem extravagant. The financial crisis in London and the mutiny\r\nat the Nore seemed to betoken the exhaustion of England, while the\r\nvictories of Bonaparte raised the power of France to heights never\r\nknown before. Before the victory of Duncan over the Dutch at\r\nCamperdown (October 11th, 1797), Britain seemed to have lost her naval\r\nsupremacy.\r\n\r\nThe recent admission of State bankruptcy at Paris, when two-thirds of\r\nthe existing liabilities were practically expunged, sharpened the\r\ndesire of the Directory to compass England's ruin, an enterprise which\r\nmight serve to restore French credit and would certainly engage those\r\nvehement activities of Bonaparte that could otherwise work mischief in\r\nParis. On his side he gladly accepted the command of the _Army of\r\nEngland_.\r\n\r\n     \"The people of Paris do not remember anything,\" he said to\r\n     Bourrienne. \"Were I to remain here long, doing nothing, I should be\r\n     lost. In this great Babylon everything wears out: my glory has\r\n     already disappeared. This little Europe does not supply enough of\r\n     it for me. I must seek it in the East: all great fame comes from\r\n     that quarter. However, I wish first to make a tour along the\r\n     [northern] coast to see for myself what may be attempted. If the\r\n     success of a descent upon England appear doubtful, as I suspect it\r\n     will, the Army of England shall become the Army of the East, and I\r\n     go to Egypt.\"[92]\r\n\r\nIn February, 1798, he paid a brief visit to Dunkirk and the Flemish\r\ncoast, and concluded that the invasion of England was altogether too\r\ncomplicated to be hazarded except as a last desperate venture. In a\r\nreport to the Government (February 23rd) he thus sums up the whole\r\nsituation:\r\n\r\n     \"Whatever efforts we make, we shall not for some years gain the\r\n     naval supremacy. To invade England without that supremacy is the\r\n     most daring and difficult task ever undertaken.... If, having\r\n     regard to the present organization of our navy, it seems impossible\r\n     to gain the necessary promptness of execution, then we must really\r\n     give up the expedition against England, _be satisfied with keeping\r\n     up the pretence of it_, and concentrate all our attention and\r\n     resources on the Rhine, in order to try to deprive England of\r\n     Hanover and Hamburg:[93] ... or else undertake an eastern\r\n     expedition which would menace her trade with the Indies. And if\r\n     none of these three operations is practicable, I see nothing else\r\n     for it but to conclude peace with England.\"\r\n\r\nThe greater part of his career serves as a commentary on these\r\ndesigns. To one or other of them he was constantly turning as\r\nalternative schemes for the subjugation of his most redoubtable foe.\r\nThe first plan he now judged to be impracticable; the second, which\r\nappears later in its fully matured form as his Continental System, was\r\nnot for the present feasible, because France was about to settle\r\nGerman affairs at the Congress of Rastadt; to the third he therefore\r\nturned the whole force of his genius.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Egypt and the restoration to France of her supremacy\r\nin India appealed to both sides of Bonaparte's nature. The vision of\r\nthe tricolour floating above the minarets of Cairo and the palace of\r\nthe Great Mogul at Delhi fascinated a mind in which the mysticism of\r\nthe south was curiously blent with the practicality and passion for\r\ndetails that characterize the northern races. To very few men in the\r\nworld's history has it been granted to dream grandiose dreams and all\r\nbut realize them, to use by turns the telescope and the microscope of\r\npolitical survey, to plan vast combinations of force, and yet to\r\nsupervise with infinite care the adjustment of every adjunct. Cæsar,\r\nin the old world, was possibly the mental peer of Bonaparte in this\r\nmajestic equipoise of the imaginative and practical qualities; but of\r\nCæsar we know comparatively little; whereas the complex workings of\r\nthe greatest mind of the modern world stand revealed in that\r\nstorehouse of facts and fancies, the \"Correspondance de Napoléon.\" The\r\nmotives which led to the Eastern Expedition are there unfolded. In the\r\nletter which he wrote to Talleyrand shortly before the signature of\r\nthe peace of Campo Formio occurs this suggestive passage:\r\n\r\n     \"The character of our nation is to be far too vivacious amidst\r\n     prosperity. If we take for the basis of all our operations true\r\n     policy, which is nothing else than the calculation of combinations\r\n     and chances, we shall long be _la grande nation_ and the arbiter of\r\n     Europe. I say more: we hold the balance of Europe: we will make\r\n     that balance incline as we wish; and, if such is the order of fate,\r\n     I think it by no means impossible that we may in a few years attain\r\n     those grand results of which the heated and enthusiastic\r\n     imagination catches a glimpse, and which the extremely cool,\r\n     persistent, and calculating man will alone attain.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was written when Bonaparte was bartering away Venice to\r\nthe Emperor in consideration of the acquisition by France of the\r\nIonian Isles. Its reference to the vivacity of the French was\r\ndoubtless evoked by the orders which he then received to\r\n\"revolutionize Italy.\" To do that, while the Directory further\r\nextorted from England Gibraltar, the Channel Islands, and her eastern\r\nconquests, was a programme dictated by excessive vivacity. The\r\nDirectory lacked the practical qualities that selected one great\r\nenterprise at a time and brought to bear on it the needful\r\nconcentration of effort. In brief, he selected the war against\r\nEngland's eastern commerce as his next sphere of action; for it\r\noffered \"an arena vaster, more necessary and resplendent\" than war\r\nwith Austria; \"if we compel the [British] Government to a peace, the\r\nadvantages we shall gain for our commerce in both hemispheres will be\r\na great step towards the consolidation of liberty and the public\r\nwelfare.\"[94]\r\n\r\nFor this eastern expedition he had already prepared. In May, 1797, he\r\nhad suggested the seizure of Malta from the Knights of St. John; and\r\nwhen, on September 27th, the Directory gave its assent, he sent\r\nthither a French commissioner, Poussielgue, on a \"commercial mission,\"\r\nto inspect those ports, and also, doubtless, to undermine the\r\ndiscipline of the Knights. Now that the British had retired from\r\nCorsica, and France disposed of the maritime resources of Northern\r\nItaly, Spain, and Holland, it seemed quite practicable to close the\r\nMediterranean to those \"intriguing and enterprising islanders,\" to\r\nhold them at bay in their dull northern seas, to exhaust them by\r\nruinous preparations against expected descents on their southern\r\ncoasts, on Ireland, and even on Scotland, while Bonaparte's eastern\r\nconquests dried up the sources of their wealth in the Orient: \"Let us\r\nconcentrate all our activity on our navy and destroy England. That\r\ndone, Europe is at our feet.\"[95]\r\n\r\nBut he encountered opposition from the Directory. They still clung to\r\ntheir plan of revolutionizing Italy; and only by playing on their fear\r\nof the army could he bring these civilians to assent to the\r\nexpatriation of 35,000 troops and their best generals. On La\r\nRéveillière-Lépeaux the young commander worked with a skill that\r\nveiled the choicest irony. This Director was the high-priest of a\r\nnewly-invented cult, termed _Théo-philanthropie_, into the dull embers\r\nof which he was still earnestly blowing. To this would-be prophet\r\nBonaparte now suggested that the eastern conquests would furnish a\r\nsplendid field for the spread of the new faith; and La Réveillière was\r\nforthwith converted from his scheme of revolutionizing Europe to the\r\ngrander sphere of moral proselytism opened out to him in the East by\r\nthe very chief who, on landing in Egypt, forthwith professed the\r\nMoslem creed.\r\n\r\nAfter gaining the doubtful assent of the Directory, Bonaparte had to\r\nface urgent financial difficulties. The dearth of money was, however,\r\nmet by two opportune interventions. The first of these was in the\r\naffairs of Rome. The disorders of the preceding year in that city had\r\nculminated at Christmas in a riot in which General Duphot had been\r\nassassinated; this outrage furnished the pretext desired by the\r\nDirectory for revolutionizing Central Italy. Berthier was at once\r\nordered to lead French troops against the Eternal City. He entered\r\nwithout resistance (February 15th, 1798), declared the civil authority\r\nof the Pope at an end, and proclaimed the _restoration_ of the Roman\r\nRepublic. The practical side of the liberating policy was soon\r\nrevealed. A second time the treasures of Rome, both artistic and\r\nfinancial, were rifled; and, as Lucien Bonaparte caustically remarked\r\nin his \"Memoirs,\" the chief duty of the newly-appointed consuls and\r\nquæstors was to superintend the packing up of pictures and statues\r\ndesigned for Paris. Berthier not only laid the basis of a large\r\nprivate fortune, but showed his sense of the object of the expedition\r\nby sending large sums for the equipment of the armada at Toulon. \"In\r\nsending me to Rome,\" wrote Berthier to Bonaparte, \"you appoint me\r\ntreasurer to the expedition against England. I will try to fill the\r\nexchequer.\"\r\n\r\nThe intervention of the Directory in the affairs of Switzerland was\r\nequally lucrative. The inhabitants of the district of Vaud, in their\r\nstruggles against the oppressive rule of the Bernese oligarchy, had\r\noffered to the French Government the excuse for interference: and a\r\nforce invading that land, overpowered the levies of the central\r\ncantons.[96] The imposition of a centralized form of government\r\nmodelled on that of France, the wresting of Geneva from this ancient\r\nconfederation, and its incorporation with France, were not the only\r\nevils suffered by Switzerland. Despite the proclamation of General\r\nBrune that the French came as friends to the descendants of William\r\nTell, and would respect their independence and their property, French\r\ncommissioners proceeded to rifle the treasuries of Berne, Zürich,\r\nSolothurn, Fribourg, and Lucerne of sums which amounted in all to\r\neight and a half million francs; fifteen millions were extorted in\r\nforced contributions and plunder, besides 130 cannon and 60,000\r\nmuskets which also became the spoils of the liberators.[97] The\r\ndestination of part of the treasure was already fixed; on April 13th\r\nBonaparte wrote an urgent letter to General Lannes, directing him to\r\nexpedite the transit of the booty to Toulon, where three million\r\nfrancs were forthwith expended on the completion of the armada.\r\n\r\nThis letter, and also the testimony of Madame de Staël, Barras,\r\nBourrienne, and Mallet du Pan, show that he must have been a party to\r\nthis interference in Swiss affairs, which marks a debasement, not only\r\nof Bonaparte's character, but of that of the French army and people.\r\nIt drew from Coleridge, who previously had seen in the Revolution the\r\ndawn of a nobler era, an indignant protest against the prostitution of\r\nthe ideas of 1789:\r\n\r\n  \"Oh France that mockest Heaven, adulterous, blind,\r\n  Are these thy boasts, champion of human kind?\r\n  To mix with Kings in the low lust of sway,\r\n  Yell in the hunt and join the murderous prey? ...\r\n  The sensual and the dark rebel in vain\r\n  Slaves by their own compulsion. In mad game\r\n  They burst their manacles: but wear the name\r\n  Of Freedom, graven on a heavier chain.\"\r\n\r\nThe occupation by French troops of the great central bastion of the\r\nEuropean system seemed a challenge, not only to idealists, but to\r\nGerman potentates. It nearly precipitated a rupture with Vienna, where\r\nthe French tricolour had recently been torn down by an angry crowd.\r\nBut Bonaparte did his utmost to prevent a renewal of war that would\r\nblight his eastern prospects; and he succeeded. One last trouble\r\nremained. At his final visit to the Directory, when crossed about some\r\ndetail, he passionately threw up his command. Thereupon Rewbell, noted\r\nfor his incisive speech, drew up the form of resignation, and\r\npresenting it to Bonaparte, firmly said, \"Sign, citizen general.\" The\r\ngeneral did not sign, but retired from the meeting apparently\r\ncrestfallen, but really meditating a _coup d'état_. This last\r\nstatement rests on the evidence of Mathieu Dumas, who heard it\r\nthrough General Desaix, a close friend of Bonaparte; and it is clear\r\nfrom the narratives of Bourrienne, Barras, and Madame Junot that,\r\nduring his last days in Paris, the general was moody, preoccupied, and\r\nfearful of being poisoned.\r\n\r\nAt last the time of preparation and suspense was at an end. The aims\r\nof the expedition as officially defined by a secret decree on April\r\n12th included the capture of Egypt and the exclusion of the English\r\nfrom \"all their possessions in the East to which the general can\r\ncome\"; Bonaparte was also to have the isthmus of Suez cut through; to\r\n\"assure the _free and exclusive_ possession of the Red Sea to the\r\nFrench Republic\"; to improve the condition of the natives of Egypt,\r\nand to cultivate good relations with the Grand Signior. Another secret\r\ndecree empowered Bonaparte to seize Malta. To these schemes he added\r\nanother of truly colossal dimensions. After conquering the East, he\r\nwould rouse the Greeks and other Christians of the East, overthrow the\r\nTurks, seize Constantinople, and \"take Europe in the rear.\"\r\n\r\nGenerous support was accorded to the _savants_ who were desirous of\r\nexploring the artistic and literary treasures of Egypt and\r\nMesopotamia. It has been affirmed by the biographer of Monge that the\r\nenthusiasm of this celebrated physicist first awakened Bonaparte's\r\ndesire for the eastern expedition; but this seems to have been\r\naroused earlier by Volney, who saw a good deal of Bonaparte in 1791.\r\nIn truth, the desire to wrest the secrets of learning from the\r\nmysterious East seems always to have spurred on his keenly inquisitive\r\nnature. During the winter months of 1797-8 he attended the chemical\r\nlectures of the renowned Berthollet; and it was no perfunctory choice\r\nwhich selected him for the place in the famous institute left vacant\r\nby the exile of Carnot. The manner in which he now signed his orders\r\nand proclamations--Member of the Institute, General in Chief of the\r\nArmy of the East--showed his determination to banish from the life of\r\nFrance that affectation of boorish ignorance by which the Terrorists\r\nhad rendered themselves uniquely odious.\r\n\r\nAfter long delays, caused by contrary winds, the armada set sail from\r\nToulon. Along with the convoys from Marseilles, Genoa, and Civita\r\nVecchia, it finally reached the grand total of 13 ships of the line, 7\r\nfrigates, several gunboats, and nearly 300 transports of various\r\nsizes, conveying 35,000 troops. Admiral Brueys was the admiral, but\r\nacting under Bonaparte. Of the generals whom the commander-in-chief\r\ntook with him, the highest in command were the divisional generals\r\nKléber, Desaix, Bon, Menou, Reynier, for the infantry: under them\r\nserved 14 generals, a few of whom, as Marmont, were to achieve a wider\r\nfame. The cavalry was commanded by the stalwart mulatto, General\r\nAlexandre Dumas, under whom served Leclerc, the husband of Pauline\r\nBonaparte, along with two men destined to world-wide renown, Murat and\r\nDavoust. The artillery was commanded by Dommartin, the engineers by\r\nCaffarelli: and the heroic Lannes was quarter-master general.\r\n\r\nThe armada appeared off Malta without meeting with any incident. This\r\nisland was held by the Knights of St. John, the last of those\r\ncompanies of Christian warriors who had once waged war on the infidels\r\nin Palestine. Their courage had evaporated in luxurious ease, and\r\ntheir discipline was a prey to intestine schisms and to the intrigues\r\ncarried on with the French Knights of the Order. A French fleet had\r\nappeared off Valetta in the month of March in the hope of effecting a\r\nsurprise; but the admiral, Brueys, judging the effort too hazardous,\r\nsent an awkward explanation, which only served to throw the knights\r\ninto the arms of Russia. One of the chivalrous dreams of the Czar Paul\r\nwas that of spreading his influence in the Mediterranean by a treaty\r\nwith this Order. It gratified his crusading ardour and promised to\r\nRussia a naval base for the partition of Turkey which was then being\r\ndiscussed with Austria: to secure the control of the island, Russia\r\nwas about to expend 400,000 roubles, when Bonaparte anticipated\r\nMuscovite designs by a prompt seizure.[98] An excuse was easily found\r\nfor a rupture with the Order: some companies of troops were\r\ndisembarked, and hostilities commenced.\r\n\r\nSecure within their mighty walls, the knights might have held the\r\nintruders at bay, had they not been divided by internal disputes: the\r\nFrench knights refused to fight against their countrymen; and a revolt\r\nof the native Maltese, long restless under the yoke of the Order, now\r\nhelped to bring the Grand Master to a surrender. The evidence of the\r\nEnglish consul, Mr. Williams, seems to show that the discontent of the\r\nnatives was even more potent than the influence of French gold in\r\nbringing about this result.[99] At any rate, one of the strongest\r\nplaces in Europe admitted a French garrison, after so tame a defence\r\nthat General Caffarelli, on viewing the fortifications, remarked to\r\nBonaparte: \"Upon my word, general, it is lucky there was some one in\r\nthe town to open the gates to us.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his stay of seven days at Malta, Bonaparte revealed the vigour\r\nof those organizing powers for which the half of Europe was soon to\r\npresent all too small an arena. He abolished the Order, pensioning off\r\nthose French knights who had been serviceable: he abolished the\r\nreligious houses and confiscated their domains to the service of the\r\nnew government: he established a governmental commission acting under\r\na military governor: he continued provisionally the existing taxes,\r\nand provided for the imposition of customs, excise, and octroi dues:\r\nhe prepared the way for the improvement of the streets, the erection\r\nof fountains, the reorganization of the hospitals and the post\r\noffice. To the university he gave special attention, rearranging the\r\ncurriculum on the model of the more advanced _écoles centrales_ of\r\nFrance, but inclining the studies severely to the exact sciences and\r\nthe useful arts. On all sides he left the imprint of his practical\r\nmind, that viewed life as a game at chess, whence bishops and knights\r\nwere carefully banished, and wherein nothing was left but the heavy\r\npieces and subservient pawns.\r\n\r\nAfter dragging Malta out of its mediaeval calm and plunging it into\r\nthe full swirl of modern progress, Bonaparte set sail for Egypt. His\r\nexchequer was the richer by all the gold and silver, whether in\r\nbullion or in vessels, discoverable in the treasury of Malta or in the\r\nChurch of St. John. Fortunately, the silver gates of this church had\r\nbeen coloured over, and thus escaped the fate of the other\r\ntreasures.[100] On the voyage to Alexandria he studied the library of\r\nbooks which he had requested Bourrienne to purchase for him. The\r\ncomposition of this library is of interest as showing the strong trend\r\nof his thoughts towards history, though at a later date he was careful\r\nto limit its study in the university and schools which he founded. He\r\nhad with him 125 volumes of historical works, among which the\r\ntranslations of Thucydides, Plutarch, Tacitus, and Livy represented\r\nthe life of the ancient world, while in modern life he concentrated\r\nhis attention chiefly on the manners and institutions of peoples and\r\nthe memoirs of great generals--as Turenne, Condé, Luxembourg, Saxe,\r\nMarlborough, Eugène, and Charles XII. Of the poets he selected the\r\nso-called Ossian, Tasso, Ariosto, Homer, Virgil, and the masterpieces\r\nof the French theatre; but he especially affected the turgid and\r\ndeclamatory style of Ossian. In romance, English literature was\r\nstrongly represented by forty volumes of novels, of course in\r\ntranslations. Besides a few works on arts and sciences, he also had\r\nwith him twelve volumes of \"Barclay's Geography,\" and three volumes of\r\n\"Cook's Voyages,\" which show that his thoughts extended to the\r\nantipodes; and under the heading of Politics he included the Bible,\r\nthe Koran, the Vedas, a Mythology, and Montesquieu's \"Esprit des\r\nLois\"! The composition and classification of this library are equally\r\nsuggestive. Bonaparte carefully searched out the weak places of the\r\norganism which he was about to attack--in the present campaign, Egypt\r\nand the British Empire. The climate and natural products, the genius\r\nof its writers and the spirit of its religion--nothing came amiss to\r\nhis voracious intellect, which assimilated the most diverse materials\r\nand pressed them all into his service. Greek mythology provided\r\nallusions for the adornment of his proclamations, the Koran would\r\ndictate his behaviour towards the Moslems, and the Bible was to be his\r\nguide-book concerning the Druses and Armenians. All three were\r\ntherefore grouped together under the head of Politics.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this, on the whole, fairly well represents his mental attitude\r\ntowards religion: at least, it was his work-a-day attitude. There were\r\nmoments, it is true, when an overpowering sense of the majesty of the\r\nuniverse lifted his whole being far above this petty opportunism: and\r\nin those moments, which, in regard to the declaration of character,\r\nmay surely be held to counterbalance whole months spent in tactical\r\nshifts and diplomatic wiles, he was capable of soaring to heights of\r\nimaginative reverence. Such an episode, lighting up for us the\r\nrecesses of his mind, occurred during his voyage to Egypt. The\r\n_savants_ on board his ship, \"L'Orient,\" were discussing one of those\r\nquestions which Bonaparte often propounded, in order that, as arbiter\r\nin this contest of wits, he might gauge their mental powers. Mental\r\ndexterity, rather than the Socratic pursuit after truth, was the aim\r\nof their dialectic; but on one occasion, when religion was being\r\ndiscussed, Bonaparte sounded a deeper note: looking up into the\r\nmidnight vault of sky, he said to the philosophizing atheists: \"Very\r\ningenious, sirs, but who made all that?\" As a retort to the\r\ntongue-fencers, what could be better? The appeal away from words to\r\nthe star-studded canopy was irresistible: it affords a signal proof of\r\nwhat Carlyle has finely called his \"instinct for nature\" and his\r\n\"ineradicable feeling for reality.\" This probably was the true man,\r\nlying deep under his Moslem shifts and Concordat bargainings.\r\n\r\nThat there was a tinge of superstition in Bonaparte's nature, such as\r\nusually appears in gifted scions of a coast-dwelling family, cannot be\r\ndenied;[101] but his usual attitude towards religion was that of the\r\npolitical mechanician, not of the devotee, and even while professing\r\nthe forms of fatalistic belief, he really subordinated them to his own\r\ndesigns. To this profound calculation of the credulity of mankind we\r\nmay probably refer his allusions to his star. The present writer\r\nregards it as almost certain that his star was invoked in order to\r\ndazzle the vulgar herd. Indeed, if we may trust Miot de Melito, the\r\nFirst Consul once confessed as much to a circle of friends. \"Cæsar,\"\r\nhe said, \"was right to cite his good fortune and to appear to believe\r\nin it. That is a means of acting on the imagination of others without\r\noffending anyone's self-love.\" A strange admission this; what\r\nboundless self-confidence it implies that he should have admitted the\r\ntrickery. The mere acknowledgment of it is a proof that he felt\r\nhimself so far above the plane of ordinary mortals that, despite the\r\ndisclosure, he himself would continue to be his own star. For the\r\nrest, is it credible that this analyzing genius could ever have\r\nseriously adopted the astrologer's creed? Is there anything in his\r\nearly note-books or later correspondence which warrants such a belief?\r\nDo not all his references to his star occur in proclamations and\r\naddresses intended for popular consumption?\r\n\r\nCertainly Bonaparte's good fortune was conspicuous all through these\r\neastern adventures, and never more so than when he escaped the pursuit\r\nof Nelson. The English admiral had divined his aim. Setting all sail,\r\nhe came almost within sight of the French force near Crete, and he\r\nreached Alexandria barely two days before his foes hove in sight.\r\nFinding no hostile force there, he doubled back on his course and\r\nscoured the seas between Crete, Sicily, and the Morca, until news\r\nreceived from a Turkish official again sent him eastwards. On such\r\ntrifles does the fate of empires sometimes depend.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile events were crowding thick and fast upon Bonaparte. To free\r\nhimself from the terrible risks which had menaced his force off the\r\nEgyptian coast, he landed his troops, 35,000 strong, with all possible\r\nexpedition at Marabout near Alexandria, and, directing his columns of\r\nattack on the walls of that city, captured it by a rush (July 2nd).\r\n\r\nFor this seizure of neutral territory he offered no excuse other than\r\nthat the Beys, who were the real rulers of Egypt, had favoured English\r\ncommerce and were guilty of some outrages on French merchants. He\r\nstrove, however, to induce the Sultan of Turkey to believe that the\r\nFrench invasion of Egypt was a friendly act, as it would overthrow the\r\npower of the Mamelukes, who had reduced Turkish authority to a mere\r\nshadow. This was the argument which he addressed to the Turkish\r\nofficials, but it proved to be too subtle even for the oriental mind\r\nfully to appreciate. Bonaparte's chief concern was to win over the\r\nsubject population, which consisted of diverse races. At the surface\r\nwere the Mamelukes, a powerful military order, possessing a\r\nmagnificent cavalry, governed by two Beys, and scarcely recognizing\r\nthe vague suzerainty claimed by the Porte. The rivalries of the Beys,\r\nMurad and Ibrahim, produced a fertile crop of discords in this\r\ngoverning caste, and their feuds exposed the subject races, both Arabs\r\nand Copts, to constant forays and exactions. It seemed possible,\r\ntherefore, to arouse them against the dominant caste, provided that\r\nthe Mohammedan scruples of the whole population were carefully\r\nrespected. To this end, the commander cautioned his troops to act\r\ntowards the Moslems as towards \"Jews and Italians,\" and to respect\r\ntheir muftis and imams as much as \"rabbis and bishops.\" He also\r\nproclaimed to the Egyptians his determination, while overthrowing\r\nMameluke tyranny, to respect the Moslem faith: \"Have we not destroyed\r\nthe Pope, who bade men wage war on Moslems? Have we not destroyed the\r\nKnights of Malta, because those fools believed it to be God's will to\r\nwar against Moslems?\" The French soldiers were vastly amused by the\r\nhumour of these proceedings, and the liberated people fully\r\nappreciated the menaces with which Bonaparte's proclamation closed,\r\nbacked up as these were by irresistible force.[102]\r\n\r\nAfter arranging affairs at Alexandria, where the gallant Kléber was\r\nleft in command, Bonaparte ordered an advance into the interior.\r\nNever, perhaps, did he show the value of swift offensive action more\r\ndecisively than in this prompt march on Damanhour across the desert.\r\nThe other route by way of Rosetta would have been easier; but, as it\r\nwas longer, he rejected it, and told off General Menou to capture that\r\ncity and support a flotilla of boats which was to ascend the Nile and\r\nmeet the army on its march to Cairo. On July 4th the first division of\r\nthe main force set forth by night into the desert south of Alexandria.\r\nAll was new and terrible; and, when the rays of the sun smote on their\r\nweary backs, the murmurings of the troops grew loud. This, then, was\r\nthe land \"more fertile than Lombardy,\" which was the goal of their\r\nwanderings. \"See, there are the six acres of land which you are\r\npromised,\" exclaimed a waggish soldier to his comrade as they first\r\ngazed from ship-board on the desert east of Alexandria; and all the\r\nsense of discipline failed to keep this and other gibes from the ears\r\nof staff officers even before they reached that city. Far worse was\r\ntheir position now in the shifting sand of the desert, beset by\r\nhovering Bedouins, stung by scorpions, and afflicted by intolerable\r\nthirst. The Arabs had filled the scanty wells with stones, and only\r\nafter long toil could the sappers reach the precious fluid beneath.\r\nThen the troops rushed and fought for the privilege of drinking a few\r\ndrops of muddy liquor. Thus they struggled on, the succeeding\r\ndivisions faring worst of all. Berthier, chief of the staff, relates\r\nthat a glass of water sold for its weight in gold. Even brave officers\r\nabandoned themselves to transports of rage and despair which left them\r\ncompletely prostrate.[103]\r\n\r\nBut Bonaparte flinched not. His stern composure offered the best\r\nrebuke to such childish sallies; and when out of a murmuring group\r\nthere came the bold remark, \"Well, General, are you going to take us\r\nto India thus,\" he abashed the speaker and his comrades by the quick\r\nretort, \"No, I would not undertake that with such soldiers as you.\"\r\nFrench honour, touched to the quick, reasserted itself even above the\r\ntorments of thirst; and the troops themselves, when they tardily\r\nreached the Nile and slaked their thirst in its waters, recognized the\r\npre-eminence of his will and his profound confidence in their\r\nendurance. French gaiety had not been wholly eclipsed even by the\r\nmiseries of the desert march. To cheer their drooping spirits the\r\ncommander had sent some of the staunchest generals along the line of\r\nmarch. Among them was the gifted Caffarelli, who had lost a leg in the\r\nRhenish campaign: his reassuring words called forth the inimitable\r\nretort from the ranks: \"Ah! he don't care, not he: he has one leg in\r\nFrance.\" Scarcely less witty was the soldier's description of the\r\nprowling Bedouins, who cut off stragglers and plunderers, as \"The\r\nmounted highway police.\"\r\n\r\nAfter brushing aside a charge of 800 Mamelukes at Chebreiss, the army\r\nmade its way up the banks of the Nile to Embabeh, opposite Cairo.\r\nThere the Mamelukes, led by the fighting Bey, Murad, had their\r\nfortified camp; and there that superb cavalry prepared to overwhelm\r\nthe invaders in a whirlwind rush of horse (July 21st, 1798). The\r\noccasion and the surroundings were such as to inspire both sides with\r\ndesperate resolution. It was the first fierce shock on land of eastern\r\nchivalry and western enterprise since the days of St. Louis; and the\r\nardour of the republicans was scarcely less than that which had\r\nkindled the soldiers of the cross. Beside the two armies rolled the\r\nmysterious Nile; beyond glittered the slender minarets of Cairo; and\r\non the south there loomed the massy Pyramids. To the forty centuries\r\nthat had rolled over them, Bonaparte now appealed, in one of those\r\nimaginative touches which ever brace the French nature to the utmost\r\ntension of daring and endurance. Thus they advanced in close formation\r\ntowards the intrenched camp of the Mamelukes. The divisions on the\r\nleft at once rushed at its earthworks, silenced its feeble artillery,\r\nand slaughtered the fellahin inside.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the other divisions, now ranged in squares, while gazing at this\r\nexploit, were assailed by the Mamelukes. From out the haze of the\r\nmirage, or from behind the ridges of sand and the scrub of the\r\nwater-melon plants that dotted the plain, some 10,000 of these superb\r\nhorsemen suddenly appeared and rushed at the squares commanded by\r\nDesaix and Reynier. Their richly caparisoned chargers, their waving\r\nplumes, their wild battle-cries, and their marvellous skill with\r\ncarbine and sword, lent picturesqueness and terror to the charge.\r\nMusketry and grapeshot mowed down their front coursers in ghastly\r\nswathes; but the living mass swept on, wellnigh overwhelming the\r\nfronts of the squares, and then, swerving aside, poured through the\r\ndeadly funnel between. Decimated here also by the steady fire of the\r\nFrench files, and by the discharges of the rear face, they fell away\r\nexhausted, leaving heaps of dead and dying on the fronts of the\r\nsquares, and in their very midst a score of their choicest cavaliers,\r\nwhose bravery and horsemanship had carried them to certain death\r\namidst the bayonets. The French now assumed the offensive, and\r\nDesaix's division, threatening to cut off the retreat of Murad's\r\nhorsemen, led that wary chief to draw off his shattered squadrons;\r\nothers sought, though with terrible losses, to escape across the Nile\r\nto Ibrahim's following. That chief had taken no share in the fight,\r\nand now made off towards Syria. Such was the battle of the Pyramids,\r\nwhich gained a colony at the cost of some thirty killed and about ten\r\ntimes as many wounded: of the killed about twenty fell victims to the\r\ncross fire of the two squares.[104]\r\n\r\nAfter halting for a fortnight at Cairo to recruit his weary troops and\r\nto arrange the affairs of his conquest, Bonaparte marched eastwards in\r\npursuit of Ibrahim and drove him into Syria, while Desaix waged an\r\narduous but successful campaign against Murad in Upper Egypt. But the\r\nvictors were soon to learn the uselessness of merely military triumphs\r\nin Egypt. As Bonaparte returned to complete the organization of the\r\nnew colony, he heard that Nelson had destroyed his fleet.\r\n\r\nOn July 3rd, before setting out from Alexandria, the French commander\r\ngave an order to his admiral, though it must be added that its\r\nauthenticity is doubtful:\r\n\r\n     \"The admiral will to-morrow acquaint the commander-in-chief by a\r\n     report whether the squadron can enter the port of Alexandria, or\r\n     whether, in Aboukir Roads, bringing its broadside to bear, it can\r\n     defend itself against the enemy's superior force; and in case both\r\n     these plans should be impracticable, he must sail for Corfu ...\r\n     leaving the light ships and the flotilla at Alexandria.\"\r\n\r\nBrueys speedily discovered that the first plan was beset by grave\r\ndangers: the entrance to the harbour of Alexandria, when sounded,\r\nproved to be most difficult for large ships--such was his judgment and\r\nthat of Villeneuve and Casabianca--and the exit could be blocked by a\r\nsingle English battleship. As regards the alternatives of Aboukir or\r\nCorfu, Brueys went on to state: \"My firm desire is to be useful to you\r\nin every possible way: and, as I have already said, every post will\r\nsuit me well, provided that you placed me there in an active way.\" By\r\nthis rather ambiguous phrase it would seem that he scouted the\r\nalternative of Corfu as consigning him to a degrading inactivity;\r\nwhile at Aboukir he held that he could be actively useful in\r\nprotecting the rear of the army. In that bay he therefore anchored his\r\nlargest ships, trusting that the dangers of the approach would screen\r\nhim from any sudden attack, but making also special preparations in\r\ncase he should be compelled to fight at anchor.[105] His decision was\r\nprobably less sound than that of Bonaparte, who, while marching to\r\nCairo, and again during his sojourn there, ordered him to make for\r\nCorfu or Toulon; for the general saw clearly that the French fleet,\r\nriding in safety in those well-protected roadsteads, would really\r\ndominate the Mediterranean better than in the open expanse of Aboukir.\r\nBut these orders did not reach the admiral before the blow fell; and\r\nit is, after all, somewhat ungenerous to censure Brueys for his\r\ndecision to remain at Aboukir and risk a fight rather than comply with\r\nthe dictates of a prudent but inglorious strategy.\r\n\r\nThe British admiral, after sweeping the eastern Mediterranean, at last\r\nfound the French fleet in Aboukir Bay, about ten miles from the\r\nRosetta mouth of the Nile. It was anchored under the lee of a shoal\r\nwhich would have prevented any ordinary admiral from attacking,\r\nespecially at sundown. But Nelson, knowing that the head ship of the\r\nFrench was free to swing at anchor, rightly concluded that there must\r\nbe room for British ships to sail between Brueys' stationary line and\r\nthe shallows. The British captains thrust five ships between the\r\nFrench and the shoal, while the others, passing down the enemy's line\r\non the seaward side, crushed it in detail; and, after a night of\r\ncarnage, the light of August 2nd dawned on a scene of destruction\r\nunsurpassed in naval warfare. Two French ships of the line and two\r\nfrigates alone escaped: one, the gigantic \"Orient,\" had blown up with\r\nthe spoils of Malta on board: the rest, eleven in number, were\r\ncaptured or burnt.\r\n\r\nTo Bonaparte this disaster came as a bolt from the blue. Only two days\r\nbefore, he had written from Cairo to Brueys that all the conduct of\r\nthe English made him believe them to be inferior in numbers and fully\r\nsatisfied with blockading Malta. Yet, in order to restore the _morale_\r\nof his army, utterly depressed by this disaster, he affected a\r\nconfidence which he could no longer feel, and said: \"Well! here we\r\nmust remain or achieve a grandeur like that of the ancients.\"[106] He\r\nhad recently assured his intimates that after routing the Beys' forces\r\nhe would return to France and strike a blow direct at England.\r\nWhatever he may have designed, he was now a prisoner in his conquest.\r\nHis men, even some of his highest officers, as Berthier, Bessières,\r\nLannes, Murat, Dumas, and others, bitterly complained of their\r\nmiserable position. But the commander, whose spirits rose with\r\nadversity, took effective means for repressing such discontent. To the\r\nlast-named, a powerful mulatto, he exclaimed: \"You have held seditious\r\nparleys: take care that I do not perform my duty: your six feet of\r\nstature shall not save you from being shot\": and he offered passports\r\nfor France to a few of the most discontented and useless officers,\r\nwell knowing that after Nelson's victory they could scarcely be used.\r\nOthers, again, out-Heroding Herod, suggested that the frigates and\r\ntransports at Alexandria should be taken to pieces and conveyed on\r\ncamels' backs to Suez, there to be used for the invasion of\r\nIndia.[107]\r\n\r\nThe versatility of Bonaparte's genius was never more marked than at\r\nthis time of discouragement. While his enemies figured him and his\r\nexhausted troops as vainly seeking to escape from those arid wastes;\r\nwhile Nelson was landing the French prisoners in order to increase his\r\nembarrassment about food, Bonaparte and his _savants_ were developing\r\nconstructive powers of the highest order, which made the army\r\nindependent of Europe. It was a vast undertaking. Deprived of most of\r\ntheir treasure and many of their mechanical appliances by the loss of\r\nthe fleet, the _savants_ and engineers had, as it were, to start from\r\nthe beginning. Some strove to meet the difficulties of food-supply by\r\nextending the cultivation of corn and rice, or by the construction of\r\nlarge ovens and bakeries, or of windmills for grinding corn. Others\r\nplanted vineyards for the future, or sought to appease the ceaseless\r\nthirst of the soldiery by the manufacture of a kind of native beer.\r\nFoundries and workshops began, though slowly, to supply tools and\r\nmachines; the earth was rifled of her treasures, natron was wrought,\r\nsaltpetre works were established, and gunpowder was thereby procured\r\nfor the army with an energy which recalled the prodigies of activity\r\nof 1793.\r\n\r\nWith his usual ardour in the cause of learning, Bonaparte several\r\ntimes a week appeared in the chemical laboratory, or witnessed the\r\nexperiments performed by Berthollet and Monge. Desirous of giving\r\ncohesion to the efforts of his _savants_, and of honouring not only\r\nthe useful arts but abstruse research, he united these pioneers of\r\nscience in a society termed the Institute of Egypt. On August 23rd,\r\n1798, it was installed with much ceremony in the palace of one of the\r\nBeys, Monge being president and Bonaparte vice-president. The general\r\nalso enrolled himself in the mathematical section of the institute.\r\nIndeed, he sought by all possible means to aid the labours of the\r\n_savants_, whose dissertations were now heard in the large hall of the\r\nharem that formerly resounded only to the twanging of lutes, weary\r\njests, and idle laughter. The labours of the _savants_ were not\r\nconfined to Cairo and the Delta. As soon as the victories of Desaix\r\nin Upper Egypt opened the middle reaches of the Nile to peaceful\r\nresearch, the treasures of Memphis were revealed to the astonished\r\ngaze of western learning. Many of the more portable relics were\r\ntransferred to Cairo, and thence to Rosetta or Alexandria, in order to\r\ngrace the museums of Paris. The _savants_ proposed, but sea-power\r\ndisposed, of these treasures. They are now, with few exceptions, in\r\nthe British Museum.\r\n\r\nApart from archæology, much was done to extend the bounds of learning.\r\nAstronomy gained much by the observations of General Caffarelli. A\r\nseries of measurements was begun for an exact survey of Egypt: the\r\ngeologists and engineers examined the course of the Nile, recorded the\r\nprogress of alluvial deposits at its mouth or on its banks, and\r\ntherefrom calculated the antiquity of divers parts of the Delta. No\r\npart of the great conqueror's career so aptly illustrates the truth of\r\nhis noble words to the magistrates of the Ligurian Republic: \"The true\r\nconquests, the only conquests which cost no regrets, are those\r\nachieved over ignorance.\"\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief outline, is the story of the renascence in Egypt. The\r\nmother-land of science and learning, after a wellnigh barren interval\r\nof 1,100 years since the Arab conquest, was now developed and\r\nillumined by the application of the arts with which in the dim past\r\nshe had enriched the life of barbarous Europe. The repayment of this\r\nincalculable debt was due primarily to the enterprise of Bonaparte. It\r\nis one of his many titles to fame and to the homage of posterity. How\r\npoor by the side of this encyclopaedic genius are the gifts even of\r\nhis most brilliant foes! At that same time the Archduke Charles of\r\nAustria was vegetating in inglorious ease on his estates. As for\r\nBeaulieu and Würmser, they had subsided into their native obscurity.\r\nNelson, after his recent triumph, persuading himself that \"Bonaparte\r\nhad gone to the devil,\" was bending before the whims of a professional\r\nbeauty and the odious despotism of the worst Court in Europe. While\r\nthe admiral tarnished his fame on the Syren coast of Naples, his great\r\nopponent bent all the resources of a fertile intellect to retrieve his\r\nposition, and even under the gloom of disaster threw a gleam of light\r\ninto the dark continent. While his adversaries were merely generals or\r\nadmirals, hampered by a stupid education and a narrow nationality,\r\nBonaparte had eagerly imbibed the new learning of his age and saw its\r\npossible influence on the reorganization of society. He is not merely\r\na general. Even when he is scattering to the winds the proud chivalry\r\nof the East, and is prescribing to Brueys his safest course of action,\r\nhe finds time vastly to expand the horizon of human knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor did he neglect Egyptian politics. He used a native council for\r\nconsultation and for the promulgation of his own ideas. Immediately\r\nafter his entry into Cairo he appointed nine sheikhs to form a divan,\r\nor council, consulting daily on public order and the food-supplies of\r\nthe city. He next assembled a general divan for Egypt, and a smaller\r\ncouncil for each province, and asked their advice concerning the\r\nadministration of justice and the collection of taxes.[108] In its use\r\nof oriental terminology, this scheme was undeniably clever; but\r\nneither French, Arabs, nor Turks were deceived as to the real\r\ngovernment, which resided entirely in Bonaparte; and his skill in\r\nreapportioning the imposts had some effect on the prosperity of the\r\nland, enabling it to bear the drain of his constant requisitions. The\r\nwelfare of the new colony was also promoted by the foundation of a\r\nmint and of an Egyptian Commercial Company.\r\n\r\nHis inventive genius was by no means exhausted by these varied toils.\r\nOn his journey to Suez he met a camel caravan in the desert, and\r\nnoticing the speed of the animals, he determined to form a camel\r\ncorps; and in the first month of 1799 the experiment was made with\r\nsuch success that admission into the ranks of the camelry came to be\r\nviewed as a favour. Each animal carried two men with their arms and\r\nbaggage: the uniform was sky-blue with a white turban; and the speed\r\nand precision of their movements enabled them to deal terrible blows,\r\neven at distant tribes of Bedouins, who bent before a genius that\r\ncould outwit them even in their own deserts.\r\n\r\nThe pleasures of his officers and men were also met by the opening of\r\nthe Tivoli Gardens; and there, in sight of the Pyramids, the life of\r\nthe Palais Royal took root: the glasses clinked, the dice rattled, and\r\nheads reeled to the lascivious movements of the eastern dance; and\r\nBonaparte himself indulged a passing passion for the wife of one of\r\nhis officers, with an openness that brought on him a rebuke from his\r\nstepson, Eugène Beauharnais. But already he had been rendered\r\ndesperate by reports of the unfaithfulness of Josephine at Paris; the\r\nnews wrung from him this pathetic letter to his brother Joseph--the\r\ndeath-cry of his long drooping idealism:\r\n\r\n     \"I have much to worry me privately, for the veil is entirely torn\r\n     aside. You alone remain to me; your affection is very dear to me:\r\n     nothing more remains to make me a misanthrope than to lose her and\r\n     see you betray me.... Buy a country seat against my return, either\r\n     near Paris or in Burgundy. I need solitude and isolation: grandeur\r\n     wearies me: the fount of feeling is dried up: glory itself is\r\n     insipid. At twenty-nine years of age I have exhausted everything.\r\n     It only remains to me to become a thorough egoist.\"[109]\r\n\r\nMany rumours were circulated as to Bonaparte's public appearance in\r\noriental costume and his presence at a religious service in a mosque.\r\nIt is even stated by Thiers that at one of the chief festivals he\r\nrepaired to the great mosque, repeated the prayers like a true Moslem,\r\ncrossing his legs and swaying his body to and fro, so that he \"edified\r\nthe believers by his orthodox piety.\" But the whole incident, however\r\nattractive scenically and in point of humour, seems to be no better\r\nauthenticated than the religious results about which the historian\r\ncherished so hopeful a belief. The truth seems to be that the general\r\nwent to the celebration of the birth of the Prophet as an interested\r\nspectator, at the house of the sheik, El Bekri. Some hundred sheikhs\r\nwere there present: they swayed their bodies to and fro while the\r\nstory of Mahomet's life was recited; and Bonaparte afterwards partook\r\nof an oriental repast. But he never forgot his dignity so far as\r\npublicly to appear in a turban and loose trousers, which he donned\r\nonly once for the amusement of his staff.[110] That he endeavoured to\r\npose as a Moslem is beyond doubt. Witness his endeavour to convince\r\nthe imams at Cairo of his desire to conform to their faith. If we may\r\nbelieve that dubious compilation, \"A Voice from St. Helena,\" he bade\r\nthem consult together as to the possibility of admission of men, who\r\nwere not circumcised and did not abstain from wine, into the true\r\nfold. As to the latter disability, he stated that the French were poor\r\ncold people, inhabitants of the north, who could not exist without\r\nwine. For a long time the imams demurred to this plea, which involved\r\ngreater difficulties than the question of circumcision: but after long\r\nconsultations they decided that both objections might be waived in\r\nconsideration of a superabundance of good works. The reply was\r\nprompted by an irony no less subtle than that which accompanied the\r\nclaim, and neither side was deceived in this contest of wits.\r\n\r\nA rude awakening soon came. For some few days there had been rumours\r\nthat the division under Desaix which was fighting the Mamelukes in\r\nUpper Egypt had been engulfed in those sandy wastes; and this report\r\nfanned to a flame the latent hostility against the unbelievers. From\r\nmany minarets of Cairo a summons to arms took the place of the\r\ncustomary call to prayer: and on October 21st the French garrison was\r\nso fiercely and suddenly attacked as to leave the issue doubtful.\r\nDiscipline and grapeshot finally prevailed, whereupon a repression of\r\noriental ferocity cowed the spirits of the townsfolk and of the\r\nneighbouring country. Forts were constructed in Cairo and at all the\r\nstrategic points along the lower Nile, and Egypt seemed to be\r\nconquered.\r\n\r\nFeeling sure now of his hold on the populace, Bonaparte, at the close\r\nof the year, undertook a journey to Suez and the Sinaitic peninsula.\r\nIt offered that combination of utility and romance which ever appealed\r\nto him. At Suez he sought to revivify commerce by lightening the\r\ncustoms' dues, by founding a branch of his Egyptian commercial\r\ncompany, and by graciously receiving a deputation of the Arabs of Tor\r\nwho came to sue for his friendship.[111] Then, journeying on, he\r\nvisited the fountains of Moses; but it is not true that (as stated by\r\nLanfrey) he proceeded to Mount Sinai and signed his name in the\r\nregister of the monastery side by side with that of Mahomet. On his\r\nreturn to the isthmus he is said to have narrowly escaped from the\r\nrising tide of the Red Sea. If we may credit Savary, who was not of\r\nthe party, its safety was due to the address of the commander, who, as\r\ndarkness fell on the bewildered band, arranged his horsemen in files,\r\nuntil the higher causeway of the path was again discovered. North of\r\nSuez the traces of the canal dug by Sesostris revealed themselves to\r\nthe trained eye of the commander. The observations of his engineers\r\nconfirmed his conjecture, but the vast labour of reconstruction\r\nforbade any attempt to construct a maritime canal. On his return to\r\nCairo he wrote to the Imam of Muscat, assuring him of his friendship\r\nand begging him to forward to Tippoo Sahib a letter offering alliance\r\nand deliverance from \"the iron yoke of England,\" and stating that the\r\nFrench had arrived on the shores of the Red Sea \"with a numerous and\r\ninvincible army.\" The letter was intercepted by a British cruiser; and\r\nthe alarm caused by these vast designs only served to spur on our\r\nforces to efforts which cost Tippoo his life and the French most of\r\ntheir Indian settlements.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSYRIA\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Turkey had declared war on France, and was sending an army\r\nthrough Syria for the recovery of Egypt, while another expedition was\r\nassembling at Rhodes. Like all great captains, Bonaparte was never\r\ncontent with the defensive: his convictions and his pugnacious\r\ninstincts alike urged him to give rather than to receive the blow; and\r\nhe argued that he could attack and destroy the Syrian force before the\r\ncessation of the winter's gales would allow the other Turkish\r\nexpedition to attempt a disembarkation at Aboukir. If he waited in\r\nEgypt, he might have to meet the two attacks at once, whereas, if he\r\nstruck at Jaffa and Acre, he would rid himself of the chief mass of\r\nhis foes. Besides, as he explained in his letter of February 10th,\r\n1799, to the Directors, his seizure of those towns would rob the\r\nEnglish fleet of its base of supplies and thereby cripple its\r\nactivities off the coast of Egypt. So far, his reasons for the Syrian\r\ncampaign are intelligible and sound. But he also gave out that,\r\nleaving Desaix and his Ethiopian supernumeraries to defend Egypt, he\r\nhimself would accomplish the conquest of Syria and the East: he would\r\nraise in revolt the Christians of the Lebanon and Armenia, overthrow\r\nthe Turkish power in Asia, and then march either on Constantinople or\r\nDelhi.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to take this quite seriously, considering that he had\r\nonly 12,000 men available for these adventures; and with anyone but\r\nBonaparte they might be dismissed as utterly Quixotic. But in his case\r\nwe must seek for some practical purpose; for he never divorced fancy\r\nfrom fact, and in his best days imagination was the hand-maid of\r\npolitics and strategy rather than the mistress. Probably these\r\ngorgeous visions were bodied forth so as to inspirit the soldiery and\r\nenthrall the imagination of France. He had already proved the immense\r\npower of imagination over that susceptible people. In one sense, his\r\nwhole expedition was but a picturesque drama; and an imposing climax\r\ncould now be found in the plan of an Eastern Empire, that opened up\r\ndazzling vistas of glory and veiled his figure in a grandiose mirage,\r\nbeside which the civilian Directors were dwarfed into ridiculous\r\npuppets.\r\n\r\nIf these vast schemes are to be taken seriously, another explanation\r\nof them is possible, namely, that he relied on the example set by\r\nAlexander the Great, who with a small but highly-trained army had\r\nshattered the stately dominions of the East. If Bonaparte trusted to\r\nthis precedent, he erred. True, Alexander began his enterprise with a\r\ncomparatively small force: but at least he had a sure base of\r\noperations, and his army in Thessaly was strong enough to prevent\r\nAthens from exchanging her sullen but passive hostility for an\r\noffensive that would endanger his communications by sea. The Athenian\r\nfleet was therefore never the danger to the Macedonians that Nelson\r\nand Sir Sidney Smith were to Bonaparte. Since the French armada\r\nweighed anchor at Toulon, Britain's position had became vastly\r\nstronger. Nelson was lord of the Mediterranean: the revolt in Ireland\r\nhad completely failed: a coalition against France was being formed;\r\nand it was therefore certain that the force in Egypt could not be\r\nmaterially strengthened. Bonaparte did not as yet know the full extent\r\nof his country's danger; but the mere fact that he would have to bear\r\nthe pressure of England's naval supremacy along the Syrian coast\r\nshould have dispelled any notion that he could rival the exploits of\r\nAlexander and become Emperor of the East.[112]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom conjectures about motives we turn to facts. Setting forth early\r\nin February, the French captured most of the Turkish advanced guard at\r\nthe fort of El Arisch, but sent their captives away on condition of\r\nnot bearing arms against France for at least one year. The victors\r\nthen marched on Jaffa, and, in spite of a spirited defence, took it\r\nby storm (March 7th). Flushed with their triumph over a cruel and\r\ndetested foe, the soldiers were giving up the city to pillage and\r\nmassacre, when two aides-de-camp promised quarter to a large body of\r\nthe defenders, who had sought refuge in a large caravanserai; and\r\ntheir lives were grudgingly spared by the victors. Bonaparte\r\nvehemently reproached his aides-de-camp for their ill-timed clemency.\r\nWhat could he now do with these 2,500 or 3,000 prisoners? They could\r\nnot be trusted to serve with the French; besides, the provisions\r\nscarcely sufficed for Bonaparte's own men, who began to complain\r\nloudly at sharing any with Turks and Albanians. They could not be sent\r\naway to Egypt, there to spread discontent: and only 300 Egyptians were\r\nso sent away.[113] Finally, on the demand of his generals and troops,\r\nthe remaining prisoners were shot down on the seashore. There is,\r\nhowever, no warrant for the malicious assertion that Bonaparte readily\r\ngave the fatal order. On the contrary, he delayed it for three days,\r\nuntil the growing difficulties and the loud complaints of his soldiers\r\nwrung it from him as a last resort.\r\n\r\nMoreover, several of the victims had already fought against him at El\r\nArisch, and had violated their promise that they would fight no more\r\nagainst the French in that campaign. M. Lanfrey's assertion that there\r\nis no evidence for the identification is untenable, in view of a\r\ndocument which I have discovered in the Records of the British\r\nAdmiralty. Inclosed with Sir Sidney Smith's despatches is one from the\r\nsecretary of Gezzar, dated Acre, March 1st, 1799, in which the Pacha\r\nurgently entreats the British commodore to come to his help, because\r\nhis (Gezzar's) troops had failed to hold El Arisch, and the _same\r\ntroops_ had also abandoned Gaza and were in great dread of the French\r\nat Jaffa. Considered from the military point of view, the massacre at\r\nJaffa is perhaps defensible; and Bonaparte's reluctant assent\r\ncontrasts favourably with the conduct of many commanders in similar\r\ncases. Perhaps an episode like that at Jaffa is not without its uses\r\nin opening the eyes of mankind to the ghastly shifts by which military\r\nglory may have to be won. The alternative to the massacre was the\r\ndetaching of a French battalion to conduct their prisoners to Egypt.\r\nAs that would seriously have weakened the little army, the prisoners\r\nwere shot.\r\n\r\nA deadlier foe was now to be faced. Already at El Arisch a few cases\r\nof the plague had appeared in Kléber's division, which had come from\r\nRosetta and Damietta; and the relics of the retreating Mameluke and\r\nTurkish forces seem also to have bequeathed that disease as a fatal\r\nlegacy to their pursuers. After Jaffa the malady attacked most\r\nbattalions of the army; and it may have quickened Bonaparte's march\r\ntowards Acre. Certain it is that he rejected Kléber's advice to\r\nadvance inland towards Nablus, the ancient Shechem, and from that\r\ncommanding centre to dominate Palestine and defy the power of\r\nGezzar.[114]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF THE SIEGE OF ACRE FROM A CONTEMPORARY SKETCH]\r\n\r\nAlways prompt to strike at the heart, the commander-in-chief\r\ndetermined to march straight on Acre, where that notorious Turkish\r\npacha sat intrenched behind weak walls and the ramparts of terror\r\nwhich his calculating ferocity had reared around him. Ever since the\r\nage of the Crusades that seaport had been the chief place of arms of\r\nPalestine; but the harbour was now nearly silted up, and even the\r\nneighbouring roadstead of Hayfa was desolate. The fortress was\r\nformidable only to orientals. In his work, \"Les Ruines,\" Volney had\r\nremarked about Acre: \"Through all this part of Asia bastions, lines of\r\ndefence, covered ways, ramparts, and in short everything relating to\r\nmodern fortification are utterly unknown; and a single thirty-gun\r\nfrigate would easily bombard and lay in ruins the whole coast.\" This\r\njudgment of his former friend undoubtedly lulled Bonaparte into\r\nillusory confidence, and the rank and file after their success at\r\nJaffa expected an easy triumph at Acre.\r\n\r\nThis would doubtless have happened but for British help. Captain\r\nMiller, of H.M.S. \"Theseus,\" thus reported on the condition of Acre\r\nbefore Sir Sidney Smith's arrival:\r\n\r\n     \"I found almost every embrasure empty except those towards the sea.\r\n     Many years' collection of the dirt of the town thrown in such a\r\n     situation as completely covered the approach to the gate from the\r\n     only guns that could flank it and from the sea ... none of their\r\n     batteries have casemates, traverses, or splinter-proofs: they have\r\n     many guns, but generally small and defective--the carriages in\r\n     general so.\" [115]\r\n\r\nCaptain Miller's energy made good some of these defects; but the place\r\nwas still lamentably weak when, on March 15th, Sir Sidney Smith\r\narrived. The English squadron in the east of the Mediterranean had,\r\nto Nelson's chagrin, been confided to the command of this ardent young\r\nofficer, who now had the good fortune to capture off the promontory of\r\nMount Carmel seven French vessels containing Bonaparte's siege-train.\r\nThis event had a decisive influence on the fortunes of the siege and\r\nof the whole campaign. The French cannon were now hastily mounted on\r\nthe very walls that they had been intended to breach; while the gun\r\nvessels reinforced the two English frigates, and were ready to pour a\r\nsearching fire on the assailants in their trenches or as they rushed\r\nagainst the walls. These had also been hastily strengthened under the\r\ndirection of a French royalist officer named Phélippeaux, an old\r\nschoolfellow of Bonaparte, and later on a comrade of Sidney Smith,\r\nalike in his imprisonment and in his escape from the clutches of the\r\nrevolutionists. Sharing the lot of the adventurous young seaman,\r\nPhélippeaux sailed to the Levant, and now brought to the defence of\r\nAcre the science of a skilled engineer. Bravely seconded by British\r\nofficers and seamen, he sought to repair the breach effected by the\r\nFrench field-pieces, and constructed at the most exposed points inner\r\ndefences, before which the most obstinate efforts of the storming\r\nparties melted away. Nine times did the assailants advance against the\r\nbreaches with the confidence born of unfailing success and redoubled\r\nby the gaze of their great commander; but as often were they beaten\r\nback by the obstinate bravery of the British seamen and Turks.\r\n\r\nThe monotony was once relieved by a quaint incident. In the course of\r\na correspondence with Bonaparte, Sir Sidney Smith is said to have\r\nshown his annoyance by sending him a challenge to a duel. It met with\r\nthe very proper reply that he would fight, if the English would send\r\nout _a Marlborough_.\r\n\r\nDuring these desperate conflicts Bonaparte detached a considerable\r\nnumber of troops inland to beat off a large Turkish and Mameluke force\r\ndestined for the relief of Acre and the invasion of Egypt. The first\r\nencounter was near Nazareth, where Junot displayed the dash and\r\nresource which had brought him fame in Italy; but the decisive battle\r\nwas fought in the Plain of Esdraëlon, not far from the base of Mount\r\nTabor. There Kléber's division of 2,000 men was for some hours hard\r\npressed by a motley array of horse and foot drawn from diverse parts\r\nof the Sultan's dominions. The heroism of the burly Alsacian and the\r\ntoughness of his men barely kept off the fierce rushes of the Moslem\r\nhorse and foot. At last Bonaparte's cannon were heard. The chief,\r\nmarching swiftly on with his troops drawn up in three squares,\r\nspeedily brushed aside the enveloping clouds of orientals; finally, by\r\nwell-combined efforts the French hurled back the enemy on passes, some\r\nof which had been seized by the commander's prescience. At the close\r\nof this memorable day (April 15th) an army of nearly 30,000 men was\r\ncompletely routed and dispersed by the valour and skilful dispositions\r\nof two divisions which together amounted to less than a seventh of\r\nthat number. No battle of modern times more closely resembles the\r\nexploits of Alexander than this masterly concentration of force; and\r\npossibly some memory of this may have prompted the words of\r\nKléber--\"General, how great you are!\"--as he met and embraced his\r\ncommander on the field of battle. Bonaparte and his staff spent the\r\nnight at the Convent of Nazareth; and when his officers burst out\r\nlaughing at the story told by the Prior of the breaking of a pillar by\r\nthe angel Gabriel at the time of the Annunciation, their untimely\r\nlevity was promptly checked by the frown of the commander.\r\n\r\nThe triumph seemed to decide the Christians of the Lebanon to ally\r\nthemselves with Bonaparte, and they secretly covenanted to furnish\r\n12,000 troops at his cost; but this question ultimately depended on\r\nthe siege of Acre. On rejoining their comrades before Acre, the\r\nvictors found that the siege had made little progress: for a time the\r\nbesiegers relied on mining operations, but with little success; though\r\nPhélippeaux succumbed to a sunstroke (May 1st), his place was filled\r\nby Colonel Douglas, who foiled the efforts of the French engineers\r\nand enabled the place to hold out till the advent of the long-expected\r\nTurkish succours. On May 7th their sails were visible far out on an\r\nalmost windless sea. At once Bonaparte made desperate efforts to carry\r\nthe \"mud-hole\" by storm. Led with reckless gallantry by the heroic\r\nLannes, his troops gained part of the wall and planted the tricolour\r\non the north-east tower; but all further progress was checked by\r\nEnglish blue-jackets, whom the commodore poured into the town; and the\r\nTurkish reinforcements, wafted landwards by a favouring breeze, were\r\nlanded in time to wrest the ramparts from the assailants' grip. On the\r\nfollowing day an assault was again attempted: from the English ships\r\nBonaparte could be clearly seen on Richard Coeur de Lion's mound\r\nurging on the French; but though, under Lannes' leadership, they\r\npenetrated to the garden of Gezzar's seraglio, they fell in heaps\r\nunder the bullets, pikes, and scimitars of the defenders, and few\r\nreturned alive to the camp. Lannes himself was dangerously wounded,\r\nand saved only by the devotion of an officer.\r\n\r\nBoth sides were now worn out by this extraordinary siege. \"This town\r\nis not, nor ever has been, defensible according to the rules of art;\r\nbut according to every other rule it must and shall be defended\"--so\r\nwrote Sir Sidney Smith to Nelson on May 9th. But a fell influence was\r\nworking against the besiegers; as the season advanced, they succumbed\r\nmore and more to the ravages of the plague; and, after failing again\r\non May 10th, many of their battalions refused to advance to the breach\r\nover the putrid remains of their comrades. Finally, Bonaparte, after\r\nclinging to his enterprise with desperate tenacity, on the night of\r\nMay 20th gave orders to retreat.\r\n\r\nThis siege of nine weeks' duration had cost him severe losses, among\r\nthem being Generals Caffarelli and Bon: but worst of all was the loss\r\nof that reputation for invincibility which he had hitherto enjoyed.\r\nHis defeat at Caldiero, near Verona, in 1796 had been officially\r\nconverted into a victory: but Acre could not be termed anything but a\r\nreverse. In vain did the commander and his staff proclaim that, after\r\ndispersing the Turks at Mount Tabor, the capture of Acre was\r\nsuperfluous; his desperate efforts in the early part of May revealed\r\nthe hollowness of his words. There were, it is true, solid reasons for\r\nhis retreat. He had just heard of the breaking out of the war of the\r\nSecond Coalition against France; and revolts in Egypt also demanded\r\nhis presence.[116] But these last events furnished a damning\r\ncommentary on his whole Syrian enterprise, which had led to a\r\ndangerous diffusion of the French forces. And for what? For the\r\nconquest of Constantinople or of India? That dream seems to have\r\nhaunted Bonaparte's brain even down to the close of the siege of Acre.\r\nDuring the siege, and later, he was heard to inveigh against \"the\r\nmiserable little hole\" which had come between him and his destiny--the\r\nEmpire of the East; and it is possible that ideas which he may at\r\nfirst have set forth in order to dazzle his comrades came finally to\r\nmaster his whole being. Certainly the words just quoted betoken a\r\nquite abnormal wilfulness as well as a peculiarly subjective notion of\r\nfatalism. His \"destiny\" was to be mapped out by his own prescience,\r\ndecided by his own will, gripped by his own powers. Such fatalism had\r\nnothing in common with the sombre creed of the East: it was merely an\r\nexcess of individualism: it was the matured expression of that feature\r\nof his character, curiously dominant even in childhood, that _what he\r\nwanted he must of necessity have_. How strange that this imperious\r\nobstinacy, this sublimation of western willpower, should not have been\r\ntamed even by the overmastering might of Nature in the Orient!\r\n\r\nAs for the Empire of the East, the declared hostility of the tribes\r\naround Nablus had shown how futile were Bonaparte's efforts to win\r\nover Moslems: and his earlier Moslem proclamations were skilfully\r\ndistributed by Sir Sidney Smith among the Christians of Syria, and\r\nserved partly to neutralize the efforts which Bonaparte made to win\r\nthem over.[117] Vain indeed was the effort to conciliate the Moslems\r\nin Egypt, and yet in Syria to arouse the Christians against the\r\nCommander of the Faithful. Such religious opportunism smacked of the\r\nParisian boulevards: it utterly ignored the tenacity of belief of the\r\nEast, where the creed is the very life. The outcome of all that\r\n_finesse_ was seen in the closing days of the siege and during the\r\nretreat towards Jaffa, when the tribes of the Lebanon and of the\r\nNablus district watched like vultures on the hills and swooped down on\r\nthe retreating columns. The pain of disillusionment, added to his\r\nsympathy with the sick and wounded, once broke down Bonaparte's\r\nnerves. Having ordered all horsemen to dismount so that there might be\r\nsufficient transport for the sick and maimed, the commander was asked\r\nby an equerry which horse he reserved for his own use. \"Did you not\r\nhear the order,\" he retorted, striking the man with his whip,\r\n\"everyone on foot.\" Rarely did this great man mar a noble action by\r\nharsh treatment: the incident sufficiently reveals the tension of\r\nfeelings, always keen, and now overwrought by physical suffering and\r\nmental disappointment.\r\n\r\nThere was indeed much to exasperate him. At Acre he had lost nearly\r\n5,000 men in killed, wounded, and plague-stricken, though he falsely\r\nreported to the Directory that his losses during the whole expedition\r\ndid not exceed 1,500 men: and during the terrible retreat to Jaffa he\r\nwas shocked, not only by occasional suicides of soldiers in his\r\npresence, but by the utter callousness of officers and men to the\r\nclaims of the sick and wounded. It was as a rebuke to this inhumanity\r\nthat he ordered all to march on foot, and his authority seems even to\r\nhave been exerted to prevent some attempts at poisoning the\r\nplague-stricken. The narrative of J. Miot, commissary of the army,\r\nshows that these suggestions originated among the soldiery at Acre\r\nwhen threatened with the toil of transporting those unfortunates back\r\nto Egypt; and, as his testimony is generally adverse to Bonaparte, and\r\nhe mentions the same horrible device, when speaking of the hospitals\r\nat Jaffa, as a camp rumour, it may be regarded as scarcely worthy of\r\ncredence.[118]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the scenes were heartrending at Jaffa; and it has been\r\ngenerally believed that the victims of the plague were then and there\r\nput out of their miseries by large doses of opium. Certainly the\r\nhospitals were crowded with wounded and victims of the plague; but\r\nduring the seven days' halt at that town adequate measures were taken\r\nby the chief medical officers, Desgenettes and Larrey, for their\r\ntransport to Egypt. More than a thousand were sent away on ships,\r\nseven of which were fortunately present; and 800 were conveyed to\r\nEgypt in carts or litters across the desert.[119] Another fact\r\nsuffices to refute the slander mentioned above. From the despatch of\r\nSir Sidney Smith to Nelson of May 30th, 1799, it appears that, when\r\nthe English commodore touched at Jaffa, he found some of the abandoned\r\nones _still alive_: \"We have found seven poor fellows in the hospital\r\nand will take care of them.\" He also supplied the French ships\r\nconveying the wounded with water, provisions, and stores, of which\r\nthey were much in need, and allowed them to proceed to their\r\ndestination. It is true that the evidence of Las Cases at St. Helena,\r\neagerly cited by Lanfrey, seems to show that some of the worst cases\r\nin the Jaffa hospitals were got rid of by opium; but the admission by\r\nNapoleon that the administering of opium was justifiable occurred in\r\none of those casuistical discussions which turn, not on facts, but on\r\nmotives. Conclusions drawn from such conversations, sixteen years or\r\nmore after the supposed occurrence, must in any case give ground\r\nbefore the evidence of contemporaries, which proves that every care\r\nwas taken of the sick and wounded, that the proposals of poisoning\r\nfirst came from the soldiery, that Napoleon both before and after\r\nJaffa set the noble example of marching on foot so that there might be\r\nsufficiency of transport, that nearly all the unfortunates arrived in\r\nEgypt and in fair condition, and that seven survivors were found alive\r\nat Jaffa by English officers.[120]\r\n\r\nThe remaining episodes of the Eastern Expedition may be briefly\r\ndismissed. After a painful desert march the army returned to Egypt in\r\nJune; and, on July 25th, under the lead of Murat and Lannes, drove\r\ninto the sea a large force of Turks which had effected a landing in\r\nAboukir Bay. Bonaparte was now weary of gaining triumphs over foes\r\nwhom he and his soldiers despised. While in this state of mind, he\r\nreceived from Sir Sidney Smith a packet of English and German\r\nnewspapers giving news up to June 6th, which brought him quickly to a\r\ndecision. The formation of a powerful coalition, the loss of Italy,\r\ndefeats on the Rhine, and the schisms, disgust, and despair prevalent\r\nin France--all drew his imagination westwards away from the illusory\r\nOrient; and he determined to leave his army to the care of Kléber and\r\nsail to France.\r\n\r\nThe morality of this step has been keenly discussed. The rank and\r\nfile of the army seem to have regarded it as little less than\r\ndesertion,[121] and the predominance of personal motives in this\r\nimportant decision can scarcely be denied. His private aim in\r\nundertaking the Eastern Expedition, that of dazzling the imagination\r\nof the French people and of exhibiting the incapacity of the\r\nDirectory, had been abundantly realized. His eastern enterprise had\r\nnow shrunk to practical and prosaic dimensions, namely, the\r\nconsolidation of French power in Egypt. Yet, as will appear in later\r\nchapters, he did not give up his oriental schemes; though at St.\r\nHelena he once oddly spoke of the Egyptian expedition as an \"exhausted\r\nenterprise,\" it is clear that he worked hard to keep his colony. The\r\ncareer of Alexander had for him a charm that even the conquests of\r\nCæsar could not rival; and at the height of his European triumphs, the\r\nhero of Austerlitz was heard to murmur: \"J'ai manqué à ma fortune à\r\nSaint-Jean d'Acre.\"[122]\r\n\r\nIn defence of his sudden return it may be urged that he had more than\r\nonce promised the Directory that his stay in Egypt would not exceed\r\nfive months; and there can be no doubt that now, as always, he had an\r\nalternative plan before him in case of failure or incomplete success\r\nin the East. To this alternative he now turned with that swiftness and\r\nfertility of resource which astonished both friends and foes in\r\ncountless battles and at many political crises.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated by Lanfrey that his appointment of Kléber to\r\nsucceed him was dictated by political and personal hostility; but it\r\nmay more naturally be considered a tribute to his abilities as a\r\ngeneral and to his influence over the soldiery, which was only second\r\nto that of Bonaparte and Desaix. He also promised to send him speedy\r\nsuccour; and as there seemed to be a probability of France regaining\r\nher naval supremacy in the Mediterranean by the union of the fleet of\r\nBruix with that of Spain, he might well hope to send ample\r\nreinforcements. He probably did not know the actual facts of the case,\r\nthat in July Bruix tamely followed the Spanish squadron to Cadiz, and\r\nthat the Directory had ordered Bruix to withdraw the French army from\r\nEgypt. But, arguing from the facts as known to him, Bonaparte might\r\nwell believe that the difficulties of France would be fully met by his\r\nown return, and that Egypt could be held with ease. The duty of a\r\ngreat commander is to be at the post of greatest danger, and that was\r\nnow on the banks of the Rhine or Mincio.\r\n\r\nThe advent of a south-east wind, a rare event there at that season of\r\nthe year, led him hastily to embark at Alexandria in the night of\r\nAugust 22nd-23rd. His two frigates bore with him some of the greatest\r\nsons of France; his chief of the staff, Berthier, whose ardent love\r\nfor Madame Visconti had been repressed by his reluctant determination\r\nto share the fortunes of his chief; Lannes and Murat, both recently\r\nwounded, but covered with glory by their exploits in Syria and at\r\nAboukir; his friend Marmont, as well as Duroc, Andréossi, Bessières,\r\nLavalette, Admiral Gantheaume, Monge, and Berthollet, his secretary\r\nBourrienne, and the traveller Denon. He also left orders that Desaix,\r\nwho had been in charge of Upper Egypt, should soon return to France,\r\nso that the rivalry between him and Kléber might not distract French\r\ncouncils in Egypt. There seems little ground for the assertion that he\r\nselected for return his favourites and men likely to be politically\r\nserviceable to him. If he left behind the ardently republican Kléber,\r\nhe also left his old friend Junot: if he brought back Berthier and\r\nMarmont, he also ordered the return of the almost Jacobinical Desaix.\r\nSir Sidney Smith having gone to Cyprus for repairs, Bonaparte slipped\r\nout unmolested. By great good fortune his frigates eluded the English\r\nships cruising between Malta and Cape Bon, and after a brief stay at\r\nAjaccio, he and his comrades landed at Fréjus (October 9th). So great\r\nwas the enthusiasm of the people that, despite all the quarantine\r\nregulations, they escorted the party to shore. \"We prefer the plague\r\nto the Austrians,\" they exclaimed; and this feeling but feebly\r\nexpressed the emotion of France at the return of the Conqueror of the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he found no domestic happiness. Josephine's _liaison_ with a\r\nyoung officer, M. Charles, had become notorious owing to his prolonged\r\nvisits to her country house, La Malmaison. Alarmed at her husband's\r\nreturn, she now hurried to meet him, but missed him on the way; while\r\nhe, finding his home at Paris empty, raged at her infidelity, refused\r\nto see her on her return, and declared he would divorce her. From this\r\nhe was turned by the prayers of Eugène and Hortense Beauharnais, and\r\nthe tears of Josephine herself. A reconciliation took place; but there\r\nwas no reunion of hearts, and Mme. Reinhard echoed the feeling of\r\nrespectable society when she wrote that he should have divorced her\r\noutright. Thenceforth he lived for Glory alone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nBRUMAIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nRarely has France been in a more distracted state than in the summer\r\nof 1799. Royalist revolts in the west and south rent the national\r\nlife. The religious schism was unhealed; education was at a\r\nstandstill; commerce had been swept from the seas by the British\r\nfleets; and trade with Italy and Germany was cut off by the war of\r\nthe Second Coalition.\r\n\r\nThe formation of this league between Russia, Austria, England, Naples,\r\nPortugal, and Turkey was in the main the outcome of the alarm and\r\nindignation aroused by the reckless conduct of the Directory, which\r\noverthrew the Bourbons at Naples, erected the Parthenopæan Republic,\r\nand compelled the King of Sardinia to abdicate at Turin and retire to\r\nhis island. Russia and Austria took a leading part in forming the\r\nCoalition. Great Britain, ever hampered by her inept army\r\norganization, offered to supply money in place of the troops which she\r\ncould not properly equip.\r\n\r\nBut under the cloak of legitimacy the monarchical Powers harboured\r\ntheir own selfish designs. This Nessus' cloak of the First Coalition\r\nsoon galled the limbs of the allies and rendered them incapable of\r\nsustained and vigorous action. Yet they gained signal successes over\r\nthe raw conscripts of France. In July, 1799, the Austro-Russian army\r\ncaptured Mantua and Alessandria; and in the following month Suvoroff\r\ngained the decisive victory of Novi and drove the remains of the\r\nFrench forces towards Genoa. The next months were far more favourable\r\nto the tricolour flag, for, owing to Austro-Russian jealousies,\r\nMasséna was able to gain an important victory at Zurich over a Russian\r\narmy. In the north the republicans were also in the end successful.\r\nTen days after Bonaparte's arrival at Fréjus, they compelled an\r\nAnglo-Russian force campaigning in Holland to the capitulation of\r\nAlkmaar, whereby the Duke of York agreed to withdraw all his troops\r\nfrom that coast. Disgusted by the conduct of his allies, the Czar Paul\r\nwithdrew his troops from any active share in the operations by land,\r\nthenceforth concentrating his efforts on the acquisition of Corsica,\r\nMalta, and posts of vantage in the Adriatic. These designs, which were\r\nwell known to the British Government, served to hamper our naval\r\nstrength in those seas, and to fetter the action of the Austrian arms\r\nin Northern Italy.[123]\r\n\r\nYet, though the schisms of the allies finally yielded a victory to the\r\nFrench in the campaigns of 1799, the position of the Republic was\r\nprecarious. The danger was rather internal than external. It arose\r\nfrom embarrassed finances, from the civil war that burst out with new\r\nviolence in the north-west, and, above all, from a sense of the\r\nsupreme difficulty of attaining political stability and of reconciling\r\nliberty with order. The struggle between the executive and legislative\r\npowers which had been rudely settled by the _coup d'état_ of\r\nFructidor, had been postponed, not solved. Public opinion was speedily\r\nruffled by the Jacobinical violence which ensued. The stifling of\r\nliberty of the press and the curtailment of the right of public\r\nmeeting served only to instill new energy into the party of resistance\r\nin the elective Councils, and to undermine a republican government\r\nthat relied on Venetian methods of rule. Reviewing the events of those\r\ndays, Madame de Staël finely remarked that only the free consent of\r\nthe people could breathe life into political institutions; and that\r\nthe monstrous system of guaranteeing freedom by despotic means served\r\nonly to manufacture governments that had to be wound up at intervals\r\nlest they should stop dead.[124] Such a sarcasm, coming from the\r\ngifted lady who had aided and abetted the stroke of Fructidor, shows\r\nhow far that event had falsified the hopes of the sincerest friends of\r\nthe Revolution. Events were therefore now favourable to a return from\r\nthe methods of Rousseau to those of Richelieu; and the genius who was\r\nskilfully to adapt republicanism to autocracy was now at hand. Though\r\nBonaparte desired at once to attack the Austrians in Northern Italy,\r\nyet a sure instinct impelled him to remain at Paris, for, as he said\r\nto Marmont: \"When the house is crumbling, is it the time to busy\r\noneself with the garden? A change here is indispensable.\"\r\n\r\nThe sudden rise of Bonaparte to supreme power cannot be understood\r\nwithout some reference to the state of French politics in the months\r\npreceding his return to France. The position of parties had been\r\nstrangely complicated by the unpopularity of the Directors. Despite\r\ntheir illegal devices, the elections of 1798 and 1799 for the renewal\r\nof a third part of the legislative Councils had signally strengthened\r\nthe anti-directorial ranks. Among the Opposition were some royalists,\r\na large number of constitutionals, whether of the Feuillant or\r\nGirondin type, and many deputies, who either vaunted the name of\r\nJacobins or veiled their advanced opinions under the convenient\r\nappellation of \"patriots.\" Many of the deputies were young,\r\nimpressionable, and likely to follow any able leader who promised to\r\nheal the schisms of the country. In fact, the old party lines were\r\nbeing effaced. The champions of the constitution of 1795 (Year III.)\r\nsaw no better means of defending it than by violating electoral\r\nliberties--always in the sacred name of Liberty; and the Directory,\r\nwhile professing to hold the balance between the extreme parties,\r\nrepressed them by turns with a vigour which rendered them popular and\r\nofficial moderation odious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this general confusion and apathy the dearth of statesmen was\r\npainfully conspicuous. Only true grandeur of character can defy the\r\nwithering influences of an age of disillusionment; and France had for\r\na time to rely upon Sieyès. Perhaps no man has built up a reputation\r\nfor political capacity on performances so slight as the Abbé Sieyès.\r\nIn the States General of 1789 he speedily acquired renown for oracular\r\nwisdom, owing to the brevity and wit of his remarks in an assembly\r\nwhere such virtues were rare. But the course of the Revolution soon\r\nshowed the barrenness of his mind and the timidity of his character.\r\nHe therefore failed to exert any lasting influence upon events. In the\r\ntime of the Terror his insignificance was his refuge. His witty reply\r\nto an inquiry how he had then fared--\"J'ai vécu \"--sufficiently\r\ncharacterizes the man. In the Directorial period he displayed more\r\nactivity. He was sent as French ambassador to Berlin, and plumed\r\nhimself on having persuaded that Court to a neutrality favourable to\r\nFrance. But it is clear that the neutrality of Prussia was the outcome\r\nof selfish considerations. While Austria tried the hazards of war, her\r\nnorthern rival husbanded her resources, strengthened her position as\r\nthe protectress of Northern Germany, and dextrously sought to attract\r\nthe nebula of middle German States into her own sphere of influence.\r\nFrom his task of tilting a balance which was already decided, Sieyès\r\nwas recalled to Paris in May, 1799, by the news of his election to the\r\nplace in the Directory vacated by Rewbell. The other Directors had\r\nstriven, but in vain, to prevent his election: they knew well that\r\nthis impracticable theorist would speedily paralyze the Government;\r\nfor, when previously elected Director in 1795, he had refused to\r\nserve, on the ground that the constitution was thoroughly bad. He now\r\ndeclared his hostility to the Directory, and looked around for some\r\ncomplaisant military chief who should act as his tool and then be\r\ncast away. His first choice, Joubert, was killed at the battle of\r\nNovi. Moreau seems then to have been looked on with favour; he was a\r\nrepublican, able in warfare and singularly devoid of skill or ambition\r\nin political matters. Relying on Moreau, Sieyès continued his\r\nintrigues, and after some preliminary fencing gained over to his side\r\nthe Director Barras. But if we may believe the assertions of the\r\nroyalist, Hyde de Neuville, Barras was also receiving the advances of\r\nthe royalists with a view to a restoration of Louis XVIII., an event\r\nwhich was then quite within the bounds of probability. For the\r\npresent, however, Barras favoured the plans of Sieyès, and helped him\r\nto get rid of the firmly republican Directors, La Réveillière-Lépeaux\r\nand Merlin, who were deposed (30th Prairial).[125]\r\n\r\nThe new Directors were Gohier, Roger Ducos, and Moulin; the first, an\r\nelderly respectable advocate; the second, a Girondin by early\r\nassociations, but a trimmer by instinct, and therefore easily gained\r\nover by Sieyès; while the recommendation of the third, Moulin, seem to\r\nhave been his political nullity and some third-rate military services\r\nin the Vendéan war. Yet the Directory of Prairial was not devoid of a\r\nspasmodic energy, which served to throw back the invaders of France.\r\nBernadotte, the fiery Gascon, remarkable for his ardent gaze, his\r\nencircling masses of coal-black hair, and the dash of Moorish blood\r\nwhich ever aroused Bonaparte's respectful apprehensions, was Minister\r\nof War, and speedily formed a new army of 100,000 men: Lindet\r\nundertook to re-establish the finances by means of progressive taxes:\r\nthe Chouan movement in the northern and western departments was\r\nrepressed by a law legalising the seizure of hostages; and there\r\nseemed some hope that France would roll back the tide of invasion,\r\nkeep her \"natural frontiers,\" and return to normal methods of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nSuch was the position of affairs when Bonaparte's arrival inspired\r\nFrance with joy and the Directory with ill-concealed dread. As in\r\n1795, so now in 1799, he appeared at Paris when French political life\r\nwas in a stage of transition. If ever the Napoleonic star shone\r\nauspiciously, it was in the months when he threaded his path between\r\nNelson's cruisers and cut athwart the maze of Sieyès' intrigues. To\r\nthe philosopher's \"J'ai vécu\" he could oppose the crushing retort\r\n\"J'ai vaincu.\"\r\n\r\nThe general, on meeting the thinker at Gohier's house, studiously\r\nignored him. In truth, he was at first disposed to oust both Sieyès\r\nand Barras from the Directory. The latter of these men was odious to\r\nhim for reasons both private and public. In time past he had had good\r\nreasons for suspecting Josephine's relations with the voluptuous\r\nDirector, and with the men whom she met at his house. During the\r\nEgyptian campaign his jealousy had been fiercely roused in another\r\nquarter, and, as we have seen, led to an almost open breach with his\r\nwife. But against Barras he still harboured strong suspicions; and the\r\nfrequency of his visits to the Director's house after returning from\r\nEgypt was doubtless due to his desire to sound the depths of his\r\nprivate as well as of his public immorality. If we may credit the\r\n_embarras de mensonges_ which has been dignified by the name of\r\nBarras' \"Memoirs,\" Josephine once fled to his house and flung herself\r\nat his knees, begging to be taken away from her husband; but the story\r\nis exploded by the moral which the relator clumsily tacks on, as to\r\nthe good advice which he gave her.[126] While Bonaparte seems to have\r\nfound no grounds for suspecting Barras on this score, he yet\r\ndiscovered his intrigues with various malcontents; and he saw that\r\nBarras, holding the balance of power in the Directory between the\r\nopposing pairs of colleagues, was intriguing to get the highest\r\npossible price for the betrayal of the Directory and of the\r\nconstitution of 1795.\r\n\r\nFor Sieyès the general felt dislike but respect. He soon saw the\r\nadvantage of an alliance with so learned a thinker, so skilful an\r\nintriguer, and so weak a man. It was, indeed, necessary; for, after\r\nmaking vain overtures to Gohier for the alteration of the law which\r\nexcluded from the Directory men of less than forty years of age,\r\nthe general needed the alliance of Sieyès for the overthrow of the\r\nconstitution. In a short space he gathered around him the malcontents\r\nwhom the frequent crises had deprived of office, Roederer, Admiral\r\nBruix, Réal, Cambacérès, and, above all, Talleyrand. The last-named;\r\nalready known for his skill in diplomacy, had special reasons for\r\nfavouring the alliance of Bonaparte and Sieyès: he had been dismissed\r\nfrom the Foreign Office in the previous month of July because in his\r\nhands it had proved to be too lucrative to the holder and too\r\nexpensive for France. It was an open secret that, when American\r\ncommissioners arrived in Paris a short time previously, for the\r\nsettlement of various disputes between the two countries, they found\r\nthat the negotiations would not progress until 250,000 dollars had\r\nchanged hands. The result was that hostilities continued, and that\r\nTalleyrand soon found himself deprived of office, until another turn\r\nof the revolutionary kaleidoscope should restore him to his coveted\r\nplace.[127] He discerned in the Bonaparte-Sieyès combination the force\r\nthat would give the requisite tilt now that Moreau gave up politics.\r\n\r\nThe army and most of the generals were also ready for some change,\r\nonly Bernadotte and Jourdan refusing to listen to the new proposals;\r\nand the former of these came \"with sufficiently bad grace\" to join\r\nBonaparte at the time of action. The police was secured through that\r\ndextrous trimmer, the regicide Fouché, who now turned against the very\r\nmen who had recently appointed him to office. Feeling sure of the\r\nsoldiery and police, the innovators fixed the 18th of Brumaire as the\r\ndate of their enterprise. There were many conferences at the houses of\r\nthe conspirators; and one of the few vivid touches which relieve the\r\ndull tones of the Talleyrand \"Memoirs\" reveals the consciousness of\r\nthese men that they were conspirators. Late on a night in the middle\r\nof Brumaire, Bonaparte came to Talleyrand's house to arrange details\r\nof the _coup d'état,_ when the noise of carriages stopping outside\r\ncaused them to pale with fear that their plans were discovered. At\r\nonce the diplomatist blew out the lights and hurried to the balcony,\r\nwhen he found that their fright was due merely to an accident to the\r\ncarriages of the revellers and gamesters returning from the Palais\r\nRoyal, which were guarded by gendarmes. The incident closed with\r\nlaughter and jests; but it illustrates the tension of the nerves of\r\nthe political gamesters, as also the mental weakness of Bonaparte when\r\nconfronted by some unknown danger. It was perhaps the only weak point\r\nin his intellectual armour; but it was to be found out at certain\r\ncrises of his career.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in the legislative Councils there was a feeling of vague\r\ndisquiet. The Ancients were, on the whole, hostile to the Directory,\r\nbut in the Council of Five Hundred the democratic ardour of the\r\nyounger deputies foreboded a fierce opposition. Yet there also the\r\nplotters found many adherents, who followed the lead now cautiously\r\ngiven by Lucien Bonaparte. This young man, whose impassioned speeches\r\nhad marked him out as an irreproachable patriot, was now President of\r\nthat Council. No event could have been more auspicious for the\r\nconspirators. With Sieyès, Barras, and Ducos, as traitors in the\r\nDirectory, with the Ancients favourable, and the junior deputies under\r\nthe presidency of Lucien, the plot seemed sure of success.\r\n\r\nThe first important step was taken by the Council of Ancients, who\r\ndecreed the transference of the sessions of the Councils to St. Cloud.\r\nThe danger of a Jacobin plot was urged as a plea for this motion,\r\nwhich was declared carried without the knowledge either of the\r\nDirectory as a whole, or of the Five Hundred, whose opposition would\r\nhave been vehement. The Ancients then appointed Bonaparte to command\r\nthe armed forces in and near Paris. The next step was to insure the\r\nabdication of Gohier and Moulin. Seeking to entrap Gohier, then the\r\nPresident of the Directory, Josephine invited him to breakfast on the\r\nmorning of 18th Brumaire; but Gohier, suspecting a snare, remained at\r\nhis official residence, the Luxemburg Palace. None the less the\r\nDirectory was doomed; for the two defenders of the institution had not\r\nthe necessary quorum for giving effect to their decrees. Moulin\r\nthereupon escaped, and Gohier was kept under guard--by Moreau's\r\nsoldiery![128]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, accompanied by a brilliant group of generals, Bonaparte\r\nproceeded to the Tuileries, where the Ancients were sitting; and by\r\nindulging in a wordy declamation he avoided taking the oath to the\r\nconstitution required of a general on entering upon a new command. In\r\nthe Council of Five Hundred, Lucien Bonaparte stopped the eager\r\nquestions and murmurs, on the pretext that the session was only legal\r\nat St. Cloud.\r\n\r\nThere, on the next day (19th Brumaire or 10th November), a far more\r\nserious blow was to be struck. The overthrow of the Directory was a\r\nforegone conclusion. But with the Legislature it was far otherwise,\r\nfor its life was still whole and vigorous. Yet, while amputating a\r\nmoribund limb, the plotters did not scruple to paralyze the brain of\r\nthe body politic.\r\n\r\nDespite the adhesion of most of the Ancients to his plans, Bonaparte,\r\non appearing before them, could only utter a succession of short,\r\njerky phrases which smacked of the barracks rather than of the Senate.\r\nRetiring in some confusion, he regains his presence of mind among the\r\nsoldiers outside, and enters the hall of the Five Hundred, intending\r\nto intimidate them not only by threats, but by armed force. At the\r\nsight of the uniforms at the door, the republican enthusiasm of the\r\nyounger deputies catches fire. They fiercely assail him with cries of\r\n\"Down with the tyrant! down with the Dictator! outlaw him!\" In vain\r\nLucien Bonaparte commands order. Several deputies rush at the general,\r\nand fiercely shake him by the collar. He turns faint with excitement\r\nand chagrin; but Lefebvre and a few grenadiers rushing up drag him\r\nfrom the hall. He comes forth like a somnambulist (says an onlooker),\r\npursued by the terrible cry, \"Hors la loi!\" Had the cries at once\r\ntaken form in a decree, the history of the world might have been\r\ndifferent. One of the deputies, General Augereau, fiercely demands\r\nthat the motion of outlawry be put to the vote. Lucien Bonaparte\r\nrefuses, protests, weeps, finally throws off his official robes, and\r\nis rescued from the enraged deputies by grenadiers whom the\r\nconspirators send in for this purpose. Meanwhile Bonaparte and his\r\nfriends were hastily deliberating, when one of their number brought\r\nthe news that the deputies had declared the general an outlaw. The\r\nnews chased the blood from his cheek, until Sieyès, whose _sang froid_\r\ndid not desert him in these civilian broils, exclaims, \"Since they\r\noutlaw you, they are outlaws.\" This revolutionary logic recalls\r\nBonaparte to himself. He shouts, \"To arms!\" Lucien, too, mounting a\r\nhorse, appeals to the soldiers to free the Council from the menaces\r\nof some deputies armed with daggers, and in the pay of England, who\r\nare terrorising the majority. The shouts of command, clinched by the\r\nadroit reference to daggers and English gold, cause the troops to\r\nwaver in their duty; and Lucien, pressing his advantage to the utmost,\r\ndraws a sword, and, holding it towards his brother, exclaims that he\r\nwill stab him if ever he attempts anything against liberty. Murat,\r\nLeclerc, and other generals enforce this melodramatic appeal by shouts\r\nfor Bonaparte, which the troops excitedly take up. The drums sound for\r\nan advance, and the troops forthwith enter the hall. In vain the\r\ndeputies raise the shout, \"Vive la République,\" and invoke the\r\nconstitution. Appeals to the law are overpowered by the drum and by\r\nshouts for Bonaparte; and the legislators of France fly pell-mell from\r\nthe hall through doors and windows.[129]\r\n\r\nThus was fulfilled the prophecy which eight years previously Burke had\r\nmade in his immortal work on the French Revolution. That great thinker\r\nhad predicted that French liberty would fall a victim to the first\r\ngreat general who drew the eyes of all men upon himself. \"The moment\r\nin which that event shall happen, the person who really commands the\r\narmy is your master, the master of your king, the master of your\r\nAssembly, the master of your whole republic.\"\r\n\r\nDiscussions about the _coup d'état_ of Brumaire generally confuse the\r\nissue at stake by ignoring the difference between the overthrow of the\r\nDirectory and that of the Legislature. The collapse of the Directory\r\nwas certain to take place; but few expected that the Legislature of\r\nFrance would likewise vanish. For vanish it did: not for nearly half\r\na century had France another free and truly democratic representative\r\nassembly. This result of Brumaire was unexpected by several of the men\r\nwho plotted the overthrow of unpopular Directors, and hoped for the\r\nnipping of Jacobinical or royalist designs. Indeed, no event in French\r\nhistory is more astonishing than the dispersal of the republican\r\ndeputies, most of whom desired a change of _personnel_ but not a\r\nrevolution in methods of government. Until a few days previously the\r\nCouncils had the allegiance of the populace and of the soldiers; the\r\ntroops at St. Cloud were loyal to the constitution, and respected the\r\npersons of the deputies until they were deluded by Lucien. For a few\r\nminutes the fate of France trembled in the balance; and the\r\nconspirators knew it.[130] Bonaparte confessed it by his incoherent\r\ngaspings; Sieyès had his carriage ready, with six horses, for flight;\r\nthe terrible cry, \"Hors la loi!\" if raised against Bonaparte in the\r\nheart of Paris, would certainly have roused the populace to fury in\r\nthe cause of liberty and have swept the conspirators to the\r\nguillotine. But, as it was, the affair was decided in the solitudes of\r\nSt. Cloud by Lucien and a battalion of soldiers.\r\n\r\nEfforts have frequently been made to represent the events of Brumaire\r\nas inevitable and to dovetail them in with a pretended philosophy of\r\nhistory. But it is impossible to study them closely without observing\r\nhow narrow was the margin between the success and failure of the plot,\r\nand how jagged was the edge of an affair which philosophizers seek to\r\nfit in with their symmetrical explanations. In truth, no event of\r\nworld-wide importance was ever decided by circumstances so trifling.\r\n\"There is but one step from triumph to a fall. I have seen that in the\r\ngreatest affairs a little thing has always decided important\r\nevents\"--so wrote Bonaparte three years before his triumph at St.\r\nCloud: he might have written it of that event. It is equally\r\nquestionable whether it can be regarded as saving France from anarchy.\r\nHis admirers, it is true, have striven to depict France as trodden\r\ndown by invaders, dissolved by anarchy, and saved only by the stroke\r\nof Brumaire. But she was already triumphant: it was quite possible\r\nthat she would peacefully adjust her governmental difficulties: they\r\nwere certainly no greater than they had been in and since the year\r\n1797: Fouché had closed the club of the Jacobins: the Councils had\r\nrecovered their rightful influence, and, but for the plotters of\r\nBrumaire, might have effected a return to ordinary government of the\r\ntype of 1795-7. This was the real blow; that the vigorous trunk, the\r\nLegislature, was struck down along with the withering Directorial\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\nThe friends of liberty might well be dismayed when they saw how tamely\r\nFrance accepted this astounding stroke. Some allowance was naturally\r\nto be made, at first, for the popular apathy: the Jacobins, already\r\ndiscouraged by past repression, were partly dazed by the suddenness of\r\nthe blow, and were also ignorant of the aims of the men who dealt it;\r\nand while they were waiting to see the import of events, power passed\r\nrapidly into the hands of Bonaparte and his coadjutors. Such is an\r\nexplanation, in part at least, of the strange docility now shown by a\r\npopulace which still vaunted its loyalty to the democratic republic.\r\nBut there is another explanation, which goes far deeper. The\r\nrevolutionary strifes had wearied the brain of France and had\r\npredisposed it to accept accomplished facts. Distracted by the talk\r\nabout royalist plots and Jacobin plots, cowering away from the white\r\nogre and the red spectre, the more credulous part of the populace was\r\nfain to take shelter under the cloak of a great soldier, who at least\r\npromised order. Everything favoured the drill-sergeant theory of\r\ngovernment. The instincts developed by a thousand years of monarchy\r\nhad not been rooted out in the last decade. They now prompted France\r\nto rally round her able man; and, abandoning political liberty as a\r\nhopeless quest, she obeyed the imperious call which promised to\r\nrevivify the order and brilliance of her old existence with the\r\nthrobbing blood of her new life.\r\n\r\nThe French constitution was now to be reconstructed by a\r\nself-appointed commission which sat with closed doors. This strange\r\nending to all the constitution-building of a decade was due to the\r\nadroitness of Lucien Bonaparte. At the close of that eventful day, the\r\n19th of Brumaire, he gathered about him in the deserted hall at St.\r\nCloud some score or so of the dispersed deputies known to be\r\nfavourable to his brother, declaimed against the Jacobins, whose\r\nspectral plot had proved so useful to the real plotters, and proposed\r\nto this \"Rump\" of the Council the formation of a commission who should\r\nreport on measures that were deemed necessary for the public safety.\r\nThe measures were found to be the deposition of the Directory, the\r\nexpulsion of sixty-one members from the Councils, the nomination of\r\nSieyès, Roger Ducos, and Bonaparte as provisional Consuls and the\r\nadjournment of the Councils for four months. The Consuls accordingly\r\ntook up their residence in the Luxemburg Palace, just vacated by the\r\nDirectors, and the drafting of a constitution was confided to them and\r\nto an _interim_ commission of fifty members chosen equally from the\r\ntwo Councils.\r\n\r\nThe illegality of these devices was hidden beneath a cloak of politic\r\nclemency. To this commission the Consuls, or rather Bonaparte--for\r\nhis will soon dominated that of Sieyès--proposed two most salutary\r\nchanges. He desired to put an end to the seizure of hostages from\r\nvillages suspected of royalism; and also to the exaction of taxes\r\nlevied on a progressive scale, which harassed the wealthy without\r\nproportionately benefiting the exchequer. These two expedients,\r\nadopted by the Directory in the summer of 1799, were temporary\r\nmeasures adopted to stem the tide of invasion and to crush revolts;\r\nbut they were regarded as signs of a permanently terrorist policy, and\r\ntheir removal greatly strengthened the new consular rule. The blunder\r\nof nearly all the revolutionary governments had been in continuing\r\nsevere laws after the need for them had ceased to be pressing.\r\nBonaparte, with infinite tact, discerned this truth, and, as will\r\nshortly appear, set himself to found his government on the support of\r\nthat vast neutral mass which was neither royalist nor Jacobin, which\r\nhated the severities of the reds no less than the abuses of the\r\n_ancien régime_.\r\n\r\nWhile Bonaparte was conciliating the many, Sieyès was striving to body\r\nforth the constitution which for many years had been nebulously\r\nfloating in his brain. The function of the Socratic [Greek: maieutaes]\r\nwas discharged by Boulay de la Meurthe, who with difficulty reduced\r\nthose ideas to definite shape. The new constitution was based on the\r\nprinciple: \"Confidence comes from below, power from above.\" This meant\r\nthat the people, that is, all adult males, were admitted only to the\r\npreliminary stages of election of deputies, while the final act of\r\nselection was to be made by higher grades or powers. The \"confidence\"\r\nrequired of the people was to be shown not only towards their\r\nnominees, but towards those who were charged with the final and most\r\nimportant act of selection. The winnowing processes in the election of\r\nrepresentatives were to be carried out on a decimal system. The adult\r\nvoters meeting in their several districts were to choose one-tenth of\r\ntheir number, this tenth being named the Notabilities of the Commune.\r\nThese, some five or six hundred thousand in number, meeting in their\r\nseveral Departments, were thereupon to choose one-tenth of their\r\nnumber; and the resulting fifty or sixty thousand men, termed\r\nNotabilities of the Departments, were again to name one-tenth of their\r\nnumber, who were styled Notabilities of the Nation. But the most\r\nimportant act of selection was still to come--from above. From this\r\nlast-named list the governing powers were to select the members of the\r\nlegislative bodies and the chief officials and servants of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe executive now claims a brief notice. The well-worn theory of the\r\ndistinction of powers, that is, the legislative and executive powers,\r\nwas maintained in Sieyès' plan. At the head of the Government the\r\nphilosopher desired to enthrone an august personage, the Grand\r\nElector, who was to be selected by the Senate. This Grand Elector was\r\nto nominate two Consuls, one for peace, the other for war; they were\r\nto nominate the Ministers of State, who in their turn selected the\r\nagents of power from the list of Notabilities of the Nation. The two\r\nConsuls and their Ministers administered the executive affairs. The\r\nSenate, sitting in dignified ease, was merely to safeguard the\r\nconstitution, to elect the Grand Elector, and to select the members of\r\nthe _Corps Législatif_ (proper) and the Tribunate.\r\n\r\nDistrust of the former almost superhuman activity in law-making now\r\nappeared in divisions, checks, and balances quite ingenious in their\r\ncomplexity. The Legislature was divided into three councils: the\r\n_Corps Législatif_, properly so called, which listened in silence to\r\nproposals of laws offered by the Council of State and criticised or\r\norally approved by the Tribunate.[131] These three bodies were not\r\nonly divided, but were placed in opposition, especially the two\r\ntalking bodies, which resembled plaintiff and defendant pleading\r\nbefore a gagged judge. But even so the constitution was not\r\nsufficiently guarded against Jacobins or royalists. If by any chance a\r\ndangerous proposal were forced through these mutually distrustful\r\nbodies, the Senate was charged with the task of vetoing it, and if the\r\nGrand Elector, or any other high official, strove to gain a perpetual\r\ndictatorship, the Senate was at once to _absorb_ him into its ranks.\r\n\r\nMoreover, lest the voters should send up too large a proportion of\r\nJacobins or royalists, the first selection of members of the great\r\nCouncils and the chief functionaries for local affairs was to be made\r\nby the Consuls, who thus primarily exercised not only the \"power from\r\nabove,\" but also the \"confidence\" which ought to have come from below.\r\nPerhaps this device was necessary to set in motion Sieyès' system of\r\nwheels within wheels; for the Senate, which was to elect the Grand\r\nElector, by whom the executive officers were indirectly to be chosen,\r\nwas in part self-sufficient: the Consuls named the first members, who\r\nthen co-opted, that is, chose the new members. Some impulse from\r\nwithout was also needed to give the constitution life; and this\r\nimpulse was now to come. Where Sieyès had only contrived wheels,\r\nchecks, regulator, break, and safety-valve, there now rushed in an\r\nimperious will which not only simplified the parts but supplied an\r\nirresistible motive power.\r\n\r\nThe complexity of much of the mechanism, especially that relating to\r\npopular election and the legislature, entirely suited Bonaparte. But,\r\nwhile approving the triple winnowing, to which Sieyès subjected the\r\nresults of manhood suffrage, and the subordination of the legislative\r\nto the executive authority,[132] the general expressed his entire\r\ndisapproval of the limitations of the Grand Elector's powers. The name\r\nwas anti-republican: let it be changed to First Consul. And whereas\r\nSieyès condemned his grand functionary to the repose of a _roi\r\nfainéant_, Bonaparte secured to him practically all the powers\r\nassigned by Sieyès to the Consuls for Peace and for War. Lastly,\r\nBonaparte protested against the right of absorbing him being given to\r\nthe Senate. Here also he was successful; and thus a delicately poised\r\nbureaucracy was turned into an almost unlimited dictatorship.\r\n\r\nThis metamorphosis may well excite wonder. But, in truth, Sieyès and\r\nhis colleagues were too weary and sceptical to oppose the one\r\n\"intensely practical man.\" To Bonaparte's trenchant reasons and\r\nincisive tones the theorist could only reply by a scornful silence\r\nbroken by a few bitter retorts. To the irresistible power of the\r\ngeneral he could only oppose the subtlety of a student. And, indeed,\r\nwho can picture Bonaparte, the greatest warrior of the age, delegating\r\nthe control of all warlike operations to a Consul for War while\r\nAustrian cannon were thundering in the county of Nice and British\r\ncruisers were insulting the French coasts? It was inevitable that the\r\nreposeful Grand Elector should be transformed into the omnipotent\r\nFirst Consul, and that these powers should be wielded by Bonaparte\r\nhimself.[133]\r\n\r\nThe extent of the First Consul's powers, as finally settled by the\r\njoint commission, was as follows. He had the direct and sole\r\nnomination of the members of the general administration, of those of\r\nthe departmental and municipal councils, and of the administrators,\r\nafterwards called prefects and sub-prefects. He also appointed all\r\nmilitary and naval officers, ambassadors and agents sent to foreign\r\nPowers, and the judges in civil and criminal suits, except the _juges\r\nde paix_ and, later on, the members of the _Cour de Cassation_. He\r\ntherefore controlled the army, navy, and diplomatic service, as well\r\nas the general administration. He also signed treaties, though these\r\nmight be discussed, and must be ratified, by the legislative bodies.\r\nThe three Consuls were to reside in the Tuileries palace; but, apart\r\nfrom the enjoyment of 150,000 francs a year, and occasional\r\nconsultation by the First Consul, the position of these officials was\r\nso awkward that Bonaparte frankly remarked to Roederer that it would\r\nhave been better to call them Grand Councillors. They were, in truth,\r\nsupernumeraries added to the chief of the State, as a concession to\r\nthe spirit of equality and as a blind to hide the reality of the new\r\ndespotism. All three were to be chosen for ten years, and were\r\nre-eligible.\r\n\r\nSuch is an outline of the constitution of 1799 (Year VIII.). It was\r\npromulgated on December 15th, 1799, and was offered to the people for\r\nacceptance, in a proclamation which closed with the words: \"Citizens,\r\nthe Revolution is confined to the principles which commenced it. It is\r\nfinished.\" The news of this last fact decided the enthusiastic\r\nacceptance of the constitution. In a _plébiscite_, or mass vote of the\r\npeople, held in the early days of 1800, it was accepted by an\r\noverwhelming majority, viz., by 3,011,007 as against only 1,562\r\nnegatives. No fact so forcibly proves the failure of absolute\r\ndemocracy in France; and, whatever may be said of the methods of\r\nsecuring this national acclaim, it was, and must ever remain, the\r\nsoundest of Bonaparte's titles to power. To a pedant who once\r\ninquired about his genealogy he significantly replied: \"It dates from\r\nBrumaire.\"\r\n\r\nShortly before the _plébiscite_, Sieyès and Ducos resigned their\r\ntemporary commissions as Consuls: they were rewarded with seats in the\r\nSenate; and Sieyès, in consideration of his constitutional work,\r\nreceived the estate of Crosne from the nation.\r\n\r\n  \"Sieyès à Bonaparte a fait present du trône,\r\n  Sous un pompeux débris croyant l'ensevelir.\r\n  Bonaparte à Sieyès a fait present de Crosne\r\n    Pour le payer et l'avilir.\"\r\n\r\nThe sting in the tail of Lebrun's epigram struck home. Sieyès'\r\nacceptance of Crosne was, in fact, his acceptance of notice to quit\r\npublic affairs, in which he had always moved with philosophic disdain.\r\nHe lived on to the year 1836 in dignified ease, surveying with\r\nOlympian calm the storms of French and Continental politics.\r\n\r\nThe two new Consuls were Cambacérès and Lebrun. The former was known\r\nas a learned jurist and a tactful man. He had voted for the death of\r\nLouis XVI., but his subsequent action had been that of a moderate, and\r\nhis knowledge of legal affairs was likely to be of the highest service\r\nto Bonaparte, who intrusted him with a general oversight of\r\nlegislation. His tact was seen in his refusal to take up his abode in\r\nthe Tuileries, lest, as he remarked to Lebrun, he might have to move\r\nout again soon. The third Consul, Lebrun, was a moderate with leanings\r\ntowards constitutional royalty. He was to prove another useful\r\nsatellite to Bonaparte, who intrusted him with the general oversight\r\nof finance and regarded him as a connecting link with the moderate\r\nroyalists. The chief secretary to the Consuls was Maret, a trusty\r\npolitical agent, who had striven for peace with England both in 1793\r\nand in 1797.\r\n\r\nAs for the Ministers, they were now reinforced by Talleyrand, who took\r\nup that of Foreign Affairs, and by Berthier, who brought his powers of\r\nhard work to that of War, until he was succeeded for a time by Carnot.\r\nLucien Bonaparte, and later Chaptal, became Minister of the Interior,\r\nGaudin controlled Finance, Forfait the Navy, and Fouché the Police.\r\nThe Council of State was organized in the following sections; that of\r\n_War_, which was presided over by General Brune: _Marine_, by Admiral\r\nGantheaume: _Finance_, by Defermon: _Legislation_, by Boulay de la\r\nMeurthe: the _Interior_, by Roederer.\r\n\r\nThe First Consul soon showed that he intended to adopt a non-partisan\r\nand thoroughly national policy. That had been, it is true, the aim of\r\nthe Directors in their policy of balance and repression of extreme\r\nparties on both sides. For the reasons above indicated, they had\r\nfailed: but now a stronger and more tactful grasp was to succeed in a\r\nfeat which naturally became easier every year that removed the\r\npassions of the revolutionary epoch further into the distance. Men\r\ncannot for ever perorate, and agitate and plot. A time infallibly\r\ncomes when an able leader can successfully appeal to their saner\r\ninstincts: and that hour had now struck. Bonaparte's appeal was made\r\nto the many, who cared not for politics, provided that they themselves\r\nwere left in security and comfort: it was urged quietly, persistently,\r\nand with the reserve power of a mighty prestige and of overwhelming\r\nmilitary force. Throughout the whole of the Consulate, a policy of\r\nmoderation, which is too often taken for weakness, was strenuously\r\ncarried through by the strongest man and the greatest warrior of the\r\nage.\r\n\r\nThe truly national character of his rule was seen in many ways. He\r\nexcluded from high office men who were notorious regicides, excepting\r\na few who, like Fouché, were too clever to be dispensed with. The\r\nconstitutionals of 1791 and even declared royalists were welcomed back\r\nto France, and many of the Fructidorian exiles also returned.[134] The\r\nlist of _émigrés_ was closed, so that neither political hatred nor\r\nprivate greed could misrepresent a journey as an act of political\r\nemigration. Equally generous and prudent was the treatment of Roman\r\nCatholics. Toleration was now extended to orthodox or non-juring\r\npriests, who were required merely to _promise_ allegiance to the new\r\nconstitution. By this act of timely clemency, orthodox priests were\r\nallowed to return to France, and they were even suffered to officiate\r\nin places where no opposition was thereby aroused.\r\n\r\nWhile thus removing one of the chief grievances of the Norman, Breton\r\nand Vendéan peasants, who had risen as much for their religion as for\r\ntheir king, he determined to crush their revolts. The north-west, and\r\nindeed parts of the south of France, were still simmering with\r\nrebellions and brigandage. In Normandy a daring and able leader named\r\nFrotté headed a considerable band of malcontents, and still more\r\nformidable were the Breton \"Chouans\" that followed the peasant leader\r\nGeorges Cadoudal. This man was a born leader. Though but thirty years\r\nof age, his fierce courage had long marked him out as the first\r\nfighter of his race and creed. His features bespoke a bold, hearty\r\nspirit, and his massive frame defied fatigue and hardship. He\r\nstruggled on; and in the autumn of 1799 fortune seemed about to favour\r\nthe \"whites\": the revolt was spreading; and had a Bourbon prince\r\nlanded in Brittany before Bonaparte returned from Egypt, the royalists\r\nmight quite possibly have overthrown the Directory. But Bonaparte's\r\ndaring changed the whole aspect of affairs. The news of the stroke of\r\nBrumaire gave the royalists pause. At first they believed that the\r\nFirst Consul would soon call back the king, and Bonaparte skilfully\r\nfavoured this notion: he offered a pacification, of which some of the\r\nharassed peasants availed themselves. Georges himself for a time\r\nadvised a reconciliation, and a meeting of the royalist leaders voted\r\nto a man that they desired \"to have the king and you\" (Bonaparte). One\r\nof them, Hyde de Neuville, had an interview with the First Consul at\r\nParis, and has left on record his surprise at seeing the slight form\r\nof the man whose name was ringing through France. At the first glance\r\nhe took him for a rather poorly dressed lackey; but when the general\r\nraised his eyes and searched him through and through with their eager\r\nfire, the royalist saw his error and fell under the spell of a gaze\r\nwhich few could endure unmoved. The interview brought no definite\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nOther overtures made by Bonaparte were more effective. True to his\r\nplan of dividing his enemies, he appealed to the clergy to end the\r\ncivil strife. The appeal struck home to the heart or the ambitions of\r\na cleric named Bernier. This man was but a village priest of La\r\nVendée: yet his natural abilities gained him an ascendancy in the\r\ncouncils of the insurgents, which the First Consul was now\r\nvictoriously to exploit. Whatever may have been Bernier's motives, he\r\ncertainly acted with some duplicity. Without forewarning Cadoudal,\r\nBourmont, Frotté, and other royalist leaders, he secretly persuaded\r\nthe less combative leaders to accept the First Consul's terms; and a\r\npacification was arranged (January 18th), In vain did Cadoudal rage\r\nagainst this treachery: in vain did he strive to break the armistice.\r\nFrotté in Normandy was the last to capitulate and the first to feel\r\nBonaparte's vengeance: on a trumped-up charge of treachery he was\r\nhurried before a court-martial and shot. An order was sent from Paris\r\nfor his pardon; but a letter which Bonaparte wrote to Brune on the day\r\nof the execution contains the ominous phrase: _By this time Frotté\r\nought to be shot_; and a recently published letter to Hédouville\r\nexpresses the belief that _the punishment of that desperate leader\r\nwill doubtless contribute to the complete pacification of the\r\nWest_.[135]\r\n\r\nIn the hope of gaining over the Chouans, Bonaparte required their\r\nchiefs to come to Paris, where they received the greatest\r\nconsideration. In Bernier the priest, Bonaparte discerned diplomatic\r\ngifts of a high order, which were soon to be tested in a far more\r\nimportant negotiation. The nobles, too, received flattering\r\nattentions which touched their pride and assured their future\r\ninsignificance. Among them was Count Bourmont, the Judas of the\r\nWaterloo campaign.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with the priest and the nobles, Georges Cadoudal stood\r\nfirm as a rock. That suave tongue spoke to him of glory, honour, and\r\nthe fatherland: he heeded it not, for he knew it had ordered the death\r\nof Frotté. There stood these fighters alone, face to face, types of\r\nthe north and south, of past and present, fiercest and toughest of\r\nliving men, their stern wills racked in wrestle for two hours. But\r\nsouthern craft was foiled by Breton steadfastness, and Georges went\r\nhis way unshamed. Once outside the palace, his only words to his\r\nfriend, Hyde de Neuville, were: \"What a mind I had to strangle him in\r\nthese arms!\" Shadowed by Bonaparte's spies, and hearing that he was\r\nto be arrested, he fled to England; and Normandy and Brittany enjoyed\r\nthe semblance of peace.[136]\r\n\r\nThus ended the civil war which for nearly seven years had rent France\r\nin twain. Whatever may be said about the details of Bonaparte's\r\naction, few will deny its beneficent results on French life. Harsh and\r\nremorseless as Nature herself towards individuals, he certainly, at\r\nthis part of his career, promoted the peace and prosperity of the\r\nmasses. And what more can be said on behalf of a ruler at the end of a\r\nbloody revolution?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the First Consul had continued to develop Sieyès'\r\nconstitution in the direction of autocracy. The Council of State,\r\nwhich was little more than an enlarged Ministry, had been charged with\r\nthe vague and dangerous function of \"developing the sense of laws\" on\r\nthe demand of the Consuls; and it was soon seen that this Council was\r\nmerely a convenient screen to hide the operations of Bonaparte's will.\r\nOn the other hand, a blow was struck at the Tribunate, the only public\r\nbody which had the right of debate and criticism. It was now proposed\r\n(January, 1800) that the time allowed for debate should be strictly\r\nlimited. This restriction to the right of free discussion met with\r\nlittle opposition. One of the most gifted of the new tribunes,\r\nBenjamin Constant, the friend of Madame de Staël, eloquently pleaded\r\nagainst this policy of distrust which would reduce the Tribunate to a\r\nsilence that would be _heard by Europe_. It was in vain. The rabid\r\nrhetoric of the past had infected France with a foolish fear of all\r\nfree debate. The Tribunate signed its own death warrant; and the sole\r\nresult of its feeble attempt at opposition was that Madame de Staël's\r\n_salon_ was forthwith deserted by the Liberals who had there found\r\ninspiration; while the gifted authoress herself was officially\r\nrequested to retire into the country.\r\n\r\nThe next act of the central power struck at freedom of the press. As a\r\nfew journals ventured on witticisms at the expense of the new\r\nGovernment, the Consuls ordered the suppression of all the political\r\njournals of Paris except thirteen; and three even of these favoured\r\npapers were suppressed on April 7th. The reason given for this\r\ndespotic action was the need of guiding public opinion wisely during\r\nthe war, and of preventing any articles \"contrary to the respect due\r\nto the social compact, to the sovereignty of the people, and to the\r\nglory of the armies.\" By a finely ironical touch Rousseau's doctrine\r\nof the popular sovereignty was thus invoked to sanction its violation.\r\nThe incident is characteristic of the whole tendency of events, which\r\nshowed that the dawn of personal rule was at hand. In fact, Bonaparte\r\nhad already taken the bold step of removing to the Tuileries, and that\r\ntoo, on the very day when he ordered public mourning for the death of\r\nWashington (February 7th). No one but the great Corsican would have\r\ndared to brave the comments which this coincidence provoked. But he\r\nwas necessary to France, and all men knew it. At the first sitting of\r\nthe provisional Consuls, Ducos had said to him: \"It is useless to vote\r\nabout the presidence; it belongs to you of right\"; and, despite the\r\nwry face pulled by Sieyès, the general at once took the chair.\r\nScarcely less remarkable than the lack of energy in statesmen was the\r\nconfusion of thought in the populace. Mme. Reinhard tells us that\r\nafter the _coup d'état_ people _believed they had returned to the\r\nfirst days of liberty_. What wonder, then, that the one able and\r\nstrong-willed man led the helpless many and re-moulded Sieyès'\r\nconstitution in a fashion that was thus happily parodied:\r\n\r\n  \"J'ai, pour les fous, d'un Tribunat\r\n    Conservé la figure;\r\n  Pour les sots je laisse un Sénat,\r\n    Mais ce n'est qu'en peinture;\r\n  A ce stupide magistrat\r\n    Ma volonté préside;\r\n  Et tout le Conseil d'Etat\r\n    Dans mon sabre réside.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nMARENGO: LUNÉVILLE\r\n\r\n\r\nReserving for the next chapter a description of the new civil\r\ninstitutions of France, it will be convenient now to turn to foreign\r\naffairs. Having arranged the most urgent of domestic questions, the\r\nFirst Consul was ready to encounter the forces of the Second\r\nCoalition. He had already won golden opinions in France by\r\nendeavouring peacefully to dissolve it. On the 25th of December, 1799,\r\nhe sent two courteous letters, one to George III., the other to the\r\nEmperor Francis, proposing an immediate end to the war. The close of\r\nthe letter to George III. has been deservedly admired: \"France and\r\nEngland by the abuse of their strength may, for the misfortune of all\r\nnations, be long in exhausting it: but I venture to declare that the\r\nfate of all civilized nations is concerned in the termination of a war\r\nwhich kindles a conflagration over the whole world.\" This noble\r\nsentiment touched the imagination of France and of friends of peace\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, if the circumstances of the time be considered, the first\r\nagreeable impressions aroused by the perusal of this letter must be\r\nclouded over by doubts. The First Consul had just seized on power by\r\nillegal and forcible means, and there was as yet little to convince\r\nforeign States that he would hold it longer than the men whom he had\r\ndisplaced. Moreover, France was in a difficult position. Her treasury\r\nwas empty; her army in Italy was being edged into the narrow\r\ncoast-line near Genoa; and her oriental forces were shut up in their\r\nnew conquest. Were not the appeals to Austria and England merely a\r\nskillful device to gain time? Did his past power in Italy and Egypt\r\nwarrant the belief that he would abandon the peninsula and the new\r\ncolony? Could the man who had bartered away Venetia and seized Malta\r\nand Egypt be fitly looked upon as the sacred'r peacemaker? In\r\ndiplomacy men's words are interpreted by their past conduct and\r\npresent circumstances, neither of which tended to produce confidence\r\nin Bonaparte's pacific overtures; and neither Francis nor George III.\r\nlooked on the present attempt as anything but a skilful means of\r\nweakening the Coalition.\r\n\r\nIndeed, that league was, for various reasons, all but dissolved by\r\ninternal dissensions. Austria was resolved to keep all the eastern\r\npart of Piedmont and the greater part of the Genoese Republic. While\r\nwelcoming the latter half of this demand, George III.'s Ministers\r\nprotested against the absorption of so great a part of Piedmont as an\r\nact of cruel injustice to the King of Sardinia. Austria was annoyed at\r\nthe British remonstrances and was indignant at the designs of the Czar\r\non Corsica. Accordingly no time could have been better chosen by\r\nBonaparte for seeking to dissolve the Coalition, as he certainly hoped\r\nto do by these two letters. Only the staunch support of legitimist\r\nclaims by England then prevented the Coalition from degenerating into\r\na scramble for Italian territories.[137] And, if we may trust the\r\nverdict of contemporaries and his own confession at St. Helena,\r\nBonaparte never expected any other result from these letters than an\r\nincrease of his popularity in France. This was enhanced by the British\r\nreply, which declared that His Majesty could not place his reliance on\r\n\"general professions of pacific dispositions\": France had waged\r\naggressive war, levied exactions, and overthrown institutions in\r\nneighbouring States; and the British Government could not as yet\r\ndiscern any abandonment of this system: something more was required\r\nfor a durable peace: \"The best and most natural pledge of its reality\r\nand permanence would be the restoration of that line of princes which\r\nfor so many centuries maintained the French nation in prosperity at\r\nhome and in consideration and respect abroad.\" This answer has been\r\nsharply criticised, and justly so, if its influence on public opinion\r\nbe alone considered. But a perusal of the British Foreign Office\r\nRecords reveals the reason for the use of these stiffly legitimist\r\nclaims. Legitimacy alone promised to stop the endless shiftings of the\r\npolitical kaleidoscope, whether by France, Austria, or Russia. Our\r\nambassador at Vienna was requested to inform the Government of Vienna\r\nof the exact wording of the British reply:\r\n\r\n     \"As a proof of the zeal and steadiness with which His Majesty\r\n     adheres to the principles of the Confederacy, and as a testimony of\r\n     the confidence with which he anticipates a similar answer from His\r\n     Imperial Majesty, to whom an overture of a similar nature has\r\n     without doubt been made.\"\r\n\r\nBut this correct conduct, while admirably adapted to prop up the\r\ntottering Coalition, was equally favourable to the consolidation of\r\nBonaparte's power. It helped to band together the French people to\r\nresist the imposition of their exiled royal house by external force.\r\nEven George III. thought it \"much too strong,\" though he suggested no\r\nalteration. At once Bonaparte retorted in a masterly note; he\r\nironically presumed that His Britannic Majesty admitted the right of\r\nnations to choose their form of government, since only by that right\r\ndid he wear the British crown; and he invited him not to apply to\r\nother peoples a principle which would recall the Stuarts to the throne\r\nof Great Britain.\r\n\r\nBonaparte's diplomatic game was completely won during the debates on\r\nthe King's speech at Westminster at the close of January, 1800. Lord\r\nGrenville laboriously proved that peace was impossible with a nation\r\nwhose war was against all order, religion, and morality; and he cited\r\nexamples of French lawlessness from Holland and Switzerland to Malta\r\nand Egypt. Pitt declared that the French Revolution was the severest\r\ntrial which Providence had ever yet inflicted on the nations of the\r\nearth; and, claiming that there was no security in negotiating with\r\nFrance, owing to her instability, he summed up his case in the\r\nCiceronian phrase: _Pacem nolo quia infida_. Ministers carried the day\r\nby 260 votes to 64; but they ranged nearly the whole of France on the\r\nside of the First Consul. No triumph in the field was worth more to\r\nhim than these Philippics, which seemed to challenge France to build\r\nup a strong Government in order that the Court of St. James might find\r\nsome firm foundation for future negotiations.\r\n\r\nFar more dextrous was the conduct of the Austrian diplomatists.\r\nAffecting to believe in the sincerity of the First Consul's proposal\r\nfor peace, they so worded their note as to draw from him a reply that\r\nhe was prepared to discuss terms of peace on the basis of the Treaty\r\nof Campo Formio.[138] As Austria had since then conquered the greater\r\npart of Italy, Bonaparte's reply immediately revealed his\r\ndetermination to reassert French supremacy in Italy and the Rhineland.\r\nThe action of the Courts of Vienna and London was not unlike that of\r\nthe sun and the wind in the proverbial saw. Viennese suavity induced\r\nBonaparte to take off his coat and show himself as he really was:\r\nwhile the conscientious bluster of Grenville and Pitt made the First\r\nConsul button up his coat, and pose as the buffeted peacemaker.\r\n\r\nThe allies had good grounds for confidence. Though Russia had\r\nwithdrawn from the Second Coalition yet the Austrians continued their\r\nvictorious advance in Italy. In April, 1800, they severed the French\r\nforces near Savona, driving back Suchet's corps towards Nice, while\r\nthe other was gradually hemmed in behind the redoubts of Genoa. There\r\nthe Imperialist advance was stoutly stayed. Masséna, ably seconded by\r\nOudinot and Soult, who now gained their first laurels as generals,\r\nmaintained a most obstinate resistance, defying alike the assaults of\r\nthe white-coats, the bombs hurled by the English squadron, and the\r\ndeadlier inroads of famine and sickness. The garrison dwindled by\r\ndegrees to less than 10,000 effectives, but they kept double the\r\nnumber of Austrians there, while Bonaparte was about to strike a\r\nterrible blow against their rear and that of Melas further west. It\r\nwas for this that the First Consul urged Masséna to hold out at Genoa\r\nto the last extremity, and nobly was the order obeyed.\r\n\r\nSuchet meanwhile defended the line of the River Var against Melas. In\r\nGermany, Moreau with his larger forces slowly edged back the chief\r\nAustrian army, that of General Kray, from the defiles of the Black\r\nForest, compelling it to fall back on the intrenched camp at Ulm.\r\n\r\nOn their side, the Austrians strove to compel Masséna to a speedy\r\nsurrender, and then with a large force to press on into Nice,\r\nProvence, and possibly Savoy, surrounding Suchet's force, and rousing\r\nthe French royalists of the south to a general insurrection. They also\r\nhad the promise of the help of a British force, which was to be landed\r\nat some point on the coast and take Suchet in the flank or rear.[139]\r\nSuch was the plan, daring in outline and promising great things,\r\nprovided that everything went well. If Masséna surrendered, if the\r\nBritish War Office and Admiralty worked up to time, if the winds were\r\nfavourable, and if the French royalists again ventured on a revolt,\r\nthen France would be crippled, perhaps conquered. As for the French\r\noccupation of Switzerland and Moreau's advance into Swabia, that was\r\nnot to prevent the prosecution of the original Austrian plan of\r\nadvancing against Provence and wresting Nice and Savoy from the French\r\ngrasp. This scheme has been criticised as if it were based solely on\r\nmilitary considerations; but it was rather dictated by schemes of\r\npolitical aggrandizement. The conquest of Nice and Savoy was necessary\r\nto complete the ambitious schemes of the Hapsburgs, who sought to gain\r\na large part of Piedmont at the expense of the King of Sardinia, and\r\nafter conquering Savoy and Nice, to thrust that unfortunate king to\r\nthe utmost verge of the peninsula, which the prowess of his\r\ndescendants has ultimately united under the Italian tricolour.\r\n\r\nThe allied plan sinned against one of the elementary rules of\r\nstrategy; it exposed a large force to a blow from the rear, namely,\r\nfrom Switzerland. The importance of this immensely strong central\r\nposition early attracted Bonaparte's attention. On the 17th of March\r\nhe called his secretary, Bourrienne (so the latter states), and lay\r\ndown with him on a map of Piedmont: then, placing pins tipped, some\r\nwith red, others with black wax, so as to denote the positions of the\r\ntroops, he asked him to guess where the French would beat their foes:\r\n\r\n     \"How the devil should I know?\" said Bourrienne. \"Why, look here,\r\n     you fool,\" said the First Consul: \"Melas is at Alessandria with his\r\n     headquarters. There he will remain until Genoa surrenders. He has\r\n     at Alessandria his magazines, his hospitals, his artillery, his\r\n     reserves. Crossing the Alps here (at the Great St. Bernard), I\r\n     shall fall upon Melas, cut off his communications with Austria, and\r\n     meet him here in the plains of the River Scrivia at San Giuliano.\"\r\n\r\nI quote this passage as showing how readily such stories of ready-made\r\nplans gain credence, until they come to be tested by Napoleon's\r\ncorrespondence. There we find no strategic soothsaying, but only a\r\nclose watching of events as they develop day by day. In March and\r\nApril he kept urging on Moreau the need of an early advance, while he\r\nconsidered the advantages offered by the St. Gotthard, Simplon, and\r\nGreat St. Bernard passes for his own army. On April 27th he decided\r\nagainst the first (except for a detachment), because Moreau's advance\r\nwas too slow to safeguard his rear on that route. He now preferred the\r\nGreat St. Bernard, but still doubted whether, after crossing, he\r\nshould make for Milan, or strike at Masséna's besiegers, in case that\r\ngeneral should be very hard pressed. Like all great commanders, he\r\nstarted with a general plan, but he arranged the details as the\r\nsituation required. In his letter of May 19th, he poured scorn on\r\nParisian editors who said he prophesied that in a month he would be at\r\nMilan. \"That is not in my character. Very often I do _not_ say what I\r\nknow: but never do I say what will be.\"\r\n\r\nThe better to hide his purpose, he chose as his first base of\r\noperations the city of Dijon, whence he seemed to threaten either the\r\nSwabian or the Italian army of his foes. But this was not enough. At\r\nthe old Burgundian capital he assembled his staff and a few regiments\r\nof conscripts in order to mislead the English and Austrian spies;\r\nwhile the fighting battalions were drafted by diverse routes to Geneva\r\nor Lausanne. So skilful were these preparations that, in the early\r\ndays of May, the greater part of his men and stores were near the lake\r\nof Geneva, whence they were easily transferred to the upper valley of\r\nthe Rhone. In order that he might have a methodical, hard-working\r\ncoadjutor he sent Berthier from the office of the Ministry of War,\r\nwhere he had displayed less ability than Bernadotte, to be\r\ncommander-in-chief of the \"army of reserve.\" In reality Berthier was,\r\nas before in Italy and Egypt, chief of the staff; but he had the\r\ntitular dignity of commander which the constitution of 1800 forbade\r\nthe First Consul to assume.\r\n\r\nOn May 6th Bonaparte left Paris for Geneva, where he felt the pulse of\r\nevery movement in both campaigns. At that city, on hearing the report\r\nof his general of engineers, he decided to take the Great St. Bernard\r\nroute into Italy, as against the Simplon. With redoubled energy, he\r\nnow supervised the thousands of details that were needed to insure\r\nsuccess: for, while prone to indulging in grandiose schemes, he\r\nrevelled in the work which alone could bring them within his grasp:\r\nor, as Wellington once remarked, \"Nothing was too great or too small\r\nfor his proboscis.\" The difficulties of sending a large army over the\r\nGreat St. Bernard were indeed immense. That pass was chosen because it\r\npresented only five leagues of ground impracticable for carriages. But\r\nthose five leagues tested the utmost powers of the army and of its\r\nchiefs. Marmont, who commanded the artillery, had devised the\r\ningenious plan of taking the cannon from their carriages and placing\r\nthem in the hollowed-out trunks of pine, so that the trunnions fitting\r\ninto large notches kept them steady during the ascent over the snow\r\nand the still more difficult descent.[140] The labour of dragging the\r\nguns wore out the peasants; then the troops were invited--a hundred at\r\na time--to take a turn at the ropes, and were exhilarated by martial\r\nairs played by the bands, or by bugles and drums sounding the charge\r\nat the worst places of the ascent.\r\n\r\nThe track sometimes ran along narrow ledges where a false step meant\r\ndeath, or where avalanches were to be feared. The elements, however,\r\nwere propitious, and the losses insignificant. This was due to many\r\ncauses: the ardour of the troops in an enterprise which appealed to\r\nFrench imagination and roused all their activities; the friendliness\r\nof the mountaineers; and the organizing powers of Bonaparte and of his\r\nstaff; all these may be cited as elements of success. They present a\r\nstriking contrast to the march of Hannibal's army over one of the\r\nwestern passes of the Alps. His motley host struggled over a long\r\nstretch of mountains in the short days of October over unknown paths,\r\nin one part swept away by a fall of the cliff, and ever and anon beset\r\nby clouds of treacherous Gauls. Seeing that the great Carthaginian's\r\ndifficulties began long before he reached the Alps, that he was\r\nencumbered by elephants, and that his army was composed of diverse\r\nraces held together only by trust in the prowess of their chief, his\r\nexploit was far more wonderful than that of Bonaparte, which, indeed,\r\nmore nearly resembles the crossing of the St. Bernard by Francis I. in\r\n1515. The difference between the conditions of Hannibal's and\r\nBonaparte's enterprises may partly be measured by the time which they\r\noccupied. Whereas Hannibal's march across the Alps lasted fifteen\r\ndays, three of which were spent in the miseries of a forced halt\r\namidst the snow, the First Consul's forces took but seven days.\r\nWhereas the Carthaginian army was weakened by hunger, the French\r\ncarried their full rations of biscuit; and at the head of the pass the\r\nmonks of the Hospice of St. Bernard served out the rations of bread,\r\ncheese, and wine which the First Consul had forwarded, and which their\r\nown generosity now doubled. The hospitable fathers themselves served\r\nat the tables set up in front of the Hospice.\r\n\r\nAfter insuring the regular succession of troops and stores, Bonaparte\r\nhimself began the ascent on May 20th. He wore the gray overcoat which\r\nhad already become famous; and his features were fixed in that\r\nexpression of calm self-possession which he ever maintained in face of\r\ndifficulty. The melodramatic attitudes of horse and rider, which David\r\nhas immortalized in his great painting, are, of course, merely\r\nsymbolical of the genius of militant democracy prancing over natural\r\nobstacles and wafted onwards and upwards by the breath of victory. The\r\nliving figure was remarkable only for stern self-restraint and\r\nsuppressed excitement; instead of the prancing war-horse limned by\r\nDavid, his beast of burden was a mule, led by a peasant; and, in place\r\nof victory, he had heard that Lannes with the vanguard had found an\r\nunexpected obstacle to his descent into Italy. The narrow valley of\r\nthe Dora Baltea, by which alone they could advance, was wellnigh\r\nblocked by the fort of Bard, which was firmly held by a small Austrian\r\ngarrison and defied all the efforts of Lannes and Berthier. This was\r\nthe news that met the First Consul during his ascent, and again at the\r\nHospice. After accepting the hospitality of the monks, and spending a\r\nshort time in the library and chapel, he resumed his journey; and on\r\nthe southern slopes he and his staff now and again amused themselves\r\nby sliding down the tracks which the passage of thousands of men had\r\nrendered slippery. After halting at Aosta, he proceeded down the\r\nvalley to the fort of Bard.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile some of his foot-soldiers had worked their way round this\r\nobstacle by a goat-track among the hills and had already reached Ivrea\r\nlower down the valley. Still the fort held out against the cannonade\r\nof the French. Its commanding position seemed to preclude all hope of\r\ngetting the artillery past it; and without artillery the First Consul\r\ncould not hope for success in the plains of Piedmont. Unable to\r\ncapture the fort, he bethought him of hurrying by night the now\r\nremounted guns under the cover of the houses of the village. For this\r\npurpose he caused the main street to be strewn with straw and dung,\r\nwhile the wheels of the cannon were covered over so as to make little\r\nnoise. They were then dragged quietly through the village almost\r\nwithin pistol shot of the garrison: nevertheless, the defenders took\r\nalarm, and, firing with musketry and grenades, exploded some\r\nammunition wagons and inflicted other losses; yet 40 guns and 100\r\nwagons were got past the fort.\r\n\r\nHow this unfailing resource contrasts with the heedless behaviour of\r\nthe enemy! Had they speedily reinforced their detachment at Bard,\r\nthere can be little doubt that Bonaparte's movements could have been\r\nseriously hampered. But, up to May 21st, Melas was ignorant that his\r\ndistant rear was being assailed, and the 3,000 Austrians who guarded\r\nthe vale of the Dora Baltea were divided, part being at Bard and\r\nothers at Ivrea. The latter place was taken by a rush of Lannes'\r\ntroops on May 22nd, and Bard was blockaded by part of the French\r\nrearguard.\r\n\r\nBonaparte's army, if the rearguard be included, numbered 41,000 men.\r\nMeanwhile, farther east, a French force of 15,000 men, drawn partly\r\nfrom Moreau's army and led by Moncey, was crossing the St. Gotthard\r\npass and began to drive back the Austrian outposts in the upper valley\r\nof the Ticino; and 5,000 men, marching over the Mont Cenis pass,\r\nthreatened Turin from the west. The First Consul's aim now was to\r\nunite the two chief forces, seize the enemy's magazines, and compel\r\nhim to a complete surrender. This daring resolve took shape at Aosta\r\non the 24th, when he heard that Melas was, on the 19th, still at Nice,\r\nunconscious of his doom. The chance of ending the war at one blow was\r\nnot to be missed, even if Masséna had to shift for himself.\r\n\r\nBut already Melas' dream of triumph had vanished. On the 21st, hearing\r\nthe astonishing news that a large force had crossed the St. Bernard,\r\nhe left 18,000 men to oppose Suchet on the Var, and hurried back with\r\nthe remainder to Turin. At the Piedmontese capital he heard that he\r\nhad to deal with the First Consul; but not until the last day of May\r\ndid he know that Moncey was forcing the St. Gotthard and threatening\r\nMilan. Then, realizing the full extent of his danger, he hastily\r\ncalled in all the available troops in order to fight his way through\r\nto Mantua. He even sent an express to the besiegers of Genoa to retire\r\non Alessandria; but negotiations had been opened with Masséna for the\r\nsurrender of that stronghold, and the opinion of Lord Keith, the\r\nEnglish admiral, decided the Austrian commander there to press the\r\nsiege to the very end. The city was in the direst straits. Horses,\r\ndogs, cats, and rats were at last eagerly sought as food: and at\r\nevery sortie crowds of the starving inhabitants followed the French in\r\norder to cut down grass, nettles, and leaves, which they then boiled\r\nwith salt.[141] A revolt threatened by the wretched townsfolk was\r\naverted by Masséna ordering his troops to fire on every gathering of\r\nmore than four men. At last, on June 4th, with 8,000 half-starved\r\nsoldiers he marched through the Austrian posts with the honours of\r\nwar. The stern warrior would not hear of the word surrender or\r\ncapitulation. He merely stated to the allied commanders that on June\r\n4th his troops would evacuate Genoa or clear their path by the\r\nbayonet.\r\n\r\nBonaparte has been reproached for not marching at once to succour\r\nMasséna: the charge of desertion was brought by Masséna and Thiébault,\r\nand has been driven home by Lanfrey with his usual skill. It will,\r\nhowever, scarcely bear a close examination. The Austrians, at the\r\nfirst trustworthy news of the French inroads into Piedmont and\r\nLombardy, were certain to concentrate either at Turin or Alessandria.\r\nIndeed, Melas was already near Turin, and would have fallen on the\r\nFirst Consul's flank had the latter marched due south towards\r\nGenoa.[142] Such a march, with only 40,000 men, would have been\r\nperilous: and it could at most only have rescued a now reduced and\r\nalmost famishing garrison. Besides, he very naturally expected the\r\nbesiegers of Genoa to retreat now that their rear was threatened.\r\n\r\nSound policy and a desire to deal a dramatic stroke spurred on the\r\nFirst Consul to a more daring and effective plan; to clear Lombardy of\r\nthe Imperialists and seize their stores; then, after uniting with\r\nMoncey's 15,000 troops, to cut off the retreat of all the Austrian\r\nforces west of Milan.\r\n\r\nOn entering Milan he was greeted with wild acclaim by the partisans of\r\nFrance (June 2nd); they extolled the energy and foresight that brought\r\ntwo armies, as it were down from the clouds, to confound their\r\noppressors. Numbers of men connected with the Cisalpine Republic had\r\nbeen proscribed, banished, or imprisoned by the Austrians; and their\r\nfriends now hailed him as the restorer of their republic. The First\r\nConsul spent seven days in selecting the men who were to rebuild the\r\nCisalpine State, in beating back the eastern forces of Austria beyond\r\nthe River Adda, and in organizing his troops and those of Moncey for\r\nthe final blow. The military problems, indeed, demanded great care and\r\njudgment. His position was curiously the reverse of that which he had\r\noccupied in 1796. Then the French held Tortona, Alessandria, and\r\nValenza, and sought to drive back the Austrians to the walls of\r\nMantua. Now the Imperialists, holding nearly the same positions, were\r\nstriving to break through the French lines which cut them off from\r\nthat city of refuge; and Bonaparte, having forces slightly inferior to\r\nhis opponents, felt the difficulty of frustrating their escape.\r\n\r\nThree routes were open to Melas. The most direct was by way of Tortona\r\nand Piacenza along the southern bank of the Po, through the difficult\r\ndefile of Stradella: or he might retire towards Genoa, across the\r\nApennines, and regain Mantua by a dash across the Modenese: or he\r\nmight cross the Po at Valenza and the Ticino near Pavia. All these\r\nroads had to be watched by the French as they cautiously drew towards\r\ntheir quarry. Bonaparte's first move was to send Murat with a\r\nconsiderable body of troops to seize Piacenza and to occupy the defile\r\nof Stradella. These important posts were wrested from the Austrian\r\nvanguard; and this success was crowned on June 9th by General Lannes'\r\nbrilliant victory at Montebello over a superior Austrian force\r\nmarching from Genoa towards Piacenza, which he drove back towards\r\nAlessandria. Smaller bodies of French were meanwhile watching the\r\ncourse of the Ticino, and others seized the magazines of the enemy at\r\nCremona.\r\n\r\nAfter gaining precious news as to Melas' movements from an intercepted\r\ndespatch, Bonaparte left Milan on June 9th, and proceeded to\r\nStradella. There he waited for news of Suchet and Masséna from the\r\nside of Savona and Ceva; for their forces, if united, might\r\ncomplete the circle which he was drawing around the Imperialists.[143]\r\nHe hoped that Masséna would have joined Suchet near Savona; but owing\r\nto various circumstances, for which Masséna was in no wise to blame,\r\ntheir junction was delayed; and Suchet, though pressing on towards\r\nAcqui, was unable to cut off the Austrian retreat on Genoa. Yet he so\r\nharassed the corps opposed to him in its retreat from Nice that only\r\nabout 8,000 Austrians joined Melas from that quarter.[144]\r\n\r\nDoubtless, Melas' best course would still have been to make a dash for\r\nGenoa and trust to the English ships. But this plan galled the pride\r\nof the general, who had culled plenteous laurels in Italy until the\r\napproach of Bonaparte threatened to snatch the whole chaplet from his\r\nbrow. He and his staff sought to restore their drooping fortunes by a\r\nbold rush against the ring of foes that were closing around. Never has\r\nan effort of this kind so nearly succeeded and yet so wholly failed.\r\n\r\nThe First Consul, believing that the Austrians were bent solely on\r\nflight, advanced from Stradella, where success would have been\r\ncertain, into the plains of Tortona, whence he could check any move of\r\ntheirs southwards on Genoa. But now the space which he occupied was so\r\ngreat as to weaken his line at any one point; while his foes had the\r\nadvantage of the central position.\r\n\r\n\r\nBonaparte was also forced to those enveloping tactics which had so\r\noften proved fatal to the Austrians four years previously; and this\r\ncurious reversal of his usual tactics may account for the anxiety\r\nwhich he betrayed as he moved towards Marengo. He had, however,\r\nrecently been encouraged by the arrival of Desaix from Paris after his\r\nreturn from Egypt. This dashing officer and noble man inspired him\r\nwith a sincere affection, as was seen by the three hours of eager\r\nconverse which he held with him on his arrival, as also by his words\r\nto Bourrienne: \"He is quite an antique character.\" Desaix with 5,300\r\ntroops was now despatched on the night of June 13th towards Genoa to\r\nstop the escape of the Austrians in that direction. This eccentric\r\nmove has been severely criticised: but the facts, as then known by\r\nBonaparte, seemed to show that Melas was about to march on Genoa. The\r\nFrench vanguard under Gardane had in the afternoon easily driven the\r\nenemy's front from the village of Marengo; and Gardane had even\r\nreported that there was no bridge over the River Bormida by which the\r\nenemy could debouch into the plain of Marengo. Marmont, pushing on\r\nlater in the evening, had discovered that there was at least one\r\nwell-defended bridge; and when early next morning Gardane's error was\r\nknown, the First Consul, with a blaze of passion against the offender,\r\nsent a courier in hot haste to recall Desaix. Long before he could\r\narrive, the battle of Marengo had begun: and for the greater part of\r\nthat eventful day, June the 14th, the French had only 18000 men\r\nwherewith to oppose the onset of 31,000 Austrians.[145]\r\n\r\nAs will be seen by the accompanying map, the village of Marengo lies\r\nin the plain that stretches eastwards from the banks of the River\r\nBormida towards the hilly country of Stradella. The village lies on\r\nthe high-road leading eastwards from the fortress of Alessandria, the\r\nchief stronghold of north-western Italy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF MARENGO TO ILLUSTRATE KELLERMANN'S CHARGE]\r\n\r\nThe plain is cut up by numerous obstacles. Through Marengo runs a\r\nstream called the Fontanone. The deep curves of the Bormida, the steep\r\nbanks of the Fontanone, along with the villages, farmsteads, and\r\nvineyards scattered over the plain, all helped to render an advance\r\nexceedingly difficult in face of a determined enemy; and these natural\r\nfeatures had no small share in deciding the fortunes of the day.\r\n\r\nShortly after dawn Melas began to pour his troops across the Bormida,\r\nand drove in the French outposts on Marengo: but there they met with a\r\ntough resistance from the soldiers of Victor's division, while\r\nKellermann, the son of the hero of Valmy, performed his first great\r\nexploit by hurling back some venturesome Austrian horsemen into the\r\ndeep bed of the Fontanone. This gave time to Lannes to bring up his\r\ndivision, 5,000 strong, into line between Marengo and Castel Ceriolo.\r\nBut when the full force of the Austrian attack was developed about 10\r\na.m., the Imperialists not only gained Marengo, but threw a heavy\r\ncolumn, led by General Ott, against Lannes, who was constrained to\r\nretire, contesting every inch of the ground. Thus, when, an hour\r\nlater, Bonaparte rode up from the distant rear, hurrying along his\r\nConsular Guard, his eye fell upon his battalions overpowered in front\r\nand outflanked on both wings. At once he launched his Consular Guard,\r\n1,000 strong, against Ott's triumphant ranks. Drawn up in square near\r\nCastel Ceriolo, it checked them for a brief space, until, plied by\r\ncannon and charged by the enemy's horse, these chosen troops also\r\nbegan to give ground. But at this crisis Monnier's division of 3,600\r\nmen arrived, threw itself into the fight, held up the flood of\r\nwhite-coats around the hamlet of Li Poggi, while Carra St. Cyr\r\nfastened his grip on Castel Ceriolo. Under cover of this welcome\r\nscreen, Victor and Lannes restored some order to their divisions and\r\nchecked for a time the onsets of the enemy. Slowly but surely,\r\nhowever, the impact of the Austrian main column, advancing along the\r\nhighroad, made them draw back on San Giuliano.\r\n\r\nBy 2 p.m. the battle seemed to be lost for the French; except on the\r\nnorth of their line they were in full retreat, and all but five of\r\ntheir cannon were silenced. Melas, oppressed by his weight of years,\r\nby the terrific heat, and by two slight wounds, retired to\r\nAlessandria, leaving his chief of the staff, Zach, to direct the\r\npursuit. But, unfortunately, Melas had sent back 2,200 horsemen to\r\nwatch the district between Alessandria and Acqui, to which latter\r\nplace Suchet's force was advancing. To guard against this remoter\r\ndanger, he weakened his attacking force at the critical time and\r\nplace; and now, when the Austrians approached the hill of San Giuliano\r\nwith bands playing and colours flying, their horse was not strong\r\nenough to complete the French defeat. Still, such was the strength of\r\ntheir onset that all resistance seemed unavailing, until about 5 p.m.\r\nthe approach of Desaix breathed new life and hope into the defence. At\r\nonce he rode up to the First Consul; and if vague rumours may be\r\ncredited, he was met by the eager question: \"Well, what do you think\r\nof it?\" To which he replied: \"The battle is lost, but there is time to\r\ngain another.\" Marmont, who heard the conversation, denies that these\r\nwords were uttered; and they presume a boldness of which even Desaix\r\nwould scarcely have been guilty to his chief. What he unquestionably\r\ndid urge was the immediate use of artillery to check the Austrian\r\nadvance: and Marmont, hastily reinforcing his own five guns with\r\nthirteen others, took a strong position and riddled the serried ranks\r\nof the enemy as, swathed in clouds of smoke and dust, they pressed\r\nblindly forward. The First Consul disposed the troops of Desaix behind\r\nthe village and a neighbouring hill; while at a little distance on the\r\nFrench left, Kellermann was ready to charge with his heavy cavalry as\r\nopportunity offered.\r\n\r\nIt came quickly. Marmont's guns unsteadied Zach's grenadiers: Desaix's\r\nmen plied them with musketry; and while they were preparing for a last\r\neffort, Kellermann's heavy cavalry charged full on their flank. Never\r\nwas surprise more complete. The column was cut in twain by this onset;\r\nand veterans, who but now seemed about to overbear all obstacles, were\r\nlying mangled by grapeshot, hacked by sabres, flying helplessly amidst\r\nthe vineyards, or surrendering by hundreds. A panic spread to their\r\ncomrades; and they gave way on all sides before the fiercely rallying\r\nFrench. The retreat became a rout as the recoiling columns neared the\r\nbridges of the Bormida: and night closed over a scene of wild\r\nconfusion, as the defeated army, thrust out from the shelter of\r\nMarengo, flung itself over the river into the stronghold of\r\nAlessandria.\r\n\r\nSuch was the victory of Marengo. It was dearly bought; for, apart from\r\nthe heavy losses, amounting on either side to about one-third of the\r\nnumber engaged, the victors sustained an irreparable loss in the death\r\nof Desaix, who fell in the moment when his skill and vigour snatched\r\nvictory from defeat. The victory was immediately due to Kellermann's\r\nbrilliant charge; and there can be no doubt, in spite of Savary's\r\nstatements, that this young officer made the charge on his own\r\ninitiative. Yet his onset could have had little effect, had not Desaix\r\nshaken the enemy and left him liable to a panic like that which\r\nbrought disaster to the Imperialists at Rivoli. Bonaparte's\r\ndispositions at the crisis were undoubtedly skilful; but in the first\r\npart of the fight his conduct was below his reputation. We do not hear\r\nof him electrifying his disordered troops by any deed comparable with\r\nthat of Cæsar, when, shield in hand, he flung himself among the\r\nlegionaries to stem the torrent of the Nervii. At the climax of the\r\nfight he uttered the words \"Soldiers, remember it is my custom to\r\nbivouac on the field of battle\"--tame and egotistical words\r\nconsidering the gravity of the crisis.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the great day, while paying an exaggerated\r\ncompliment to Bessières and the cavalry of the Consular Guard, he\r\nmerely remarked to Kellermann: \"You made a very good charge\"; to which\r\nthat officer is said to have replied: \"I am glad you are satisfied,\r\ngeneral: for it has placed the crown on your head.\" Such pettiness was\r\nunworthy of the great captain who could design and carry through the\r\nmemorable campaign of Marengo. If the climax was not worthy of the\r\ninception, yet the campaign as a whole must be pronounced a\r\nmasterpiece. Since the days of Hannibal no design so daring and\r\noriginal had startled the world. A great Austrian army was stopped in\r\nits victorious career, was compelled to turn on its shattered\r\ncommunications, and to fight for its existence some 120 miles to the\r\nrear of the territory which it seemed to have conquered. In fact, the\r\nallied victories of the past year were effaced by this march of\r\nBonaparte's army, which, in less than a month after the ascent of the\r\nAlps, regained Nice, Piedmont, and Lombardy, and reduced the\r\nImperialists to the direst straits.\r\n\r\nStaggered by this terrific blow, Melas and his staff were ready to\r\naccept any terms that were not deeply humiliating; and Bonaparte on\r\nhis side was not loth to end the campaign in a blaze of glory. He\r\nconsented that the Imperial troops should retire to the east of the\r\nMincio, except at Peschiera and Mantua, which they were still to\r\noccupy. These terms have been variously criticised: Melas has been\r\nblamed for cowardice in surrendering the many strongholds, including\r\nGenoa, which his men firmly held. Yet it must be remembered that he\r\nnow had at Alessandria less than 20,000 effectives, and that 30,000\r\nAustrians in isolated bodies were practically at the mercy of the\r\nFrench between Savona and Brescia. One and all they could now retire\r\nto the Mincio and there resume the defence of the Imperial\r\nterritories. The political designs of the Court of Vienna on Piedmont\r\nwere of course shattered; but it now recovered the army which it had\r\nheedlessly sacrificed to territorial greed. Bonaparte has also been\r\nblamed for the lenience of his terms. Severer conditions could\r\ndoubtless have been extorted; but he now merged the soldier in the\r\nstatesman. He desired peace for the sake of France and for his own\r\nsake. After this brilliant stroke peace would be doubly grateful to a\r\npeople that longed for glory but also yearned to heal the wounds of\r\neight years' warfare. His own position as First Consul was as yet\r\nill-established; and he desired to be back at Paris so as to curb the\r\nrestive Tribunate, overawe Jacobins and royalists, and rebuild the\r\ninstitutions of France.\r\n\r\nImpelled by these motives, he penned to the Emperor Francis an\r\neloquent appeal for peace, renewing his offer of treating with Austria\r\non the basis of the treaty of Campo Formio.[146] But Austria was not\r\nas yet so far humbled as to accept such terms; and it needed the\r\nmaster-stroke of Moreau at the great battle of Hohenlinden (December\r\n2nd, 1800), and the turning of her fortresses on the Mincio by the\r\nbrilliant passage of the Splügen in the depths of winter by\r\nMacdonald--a feat far transcending that of Bonaparte at the St.\r\nBernard--to compel her to a peace. A description of these events would\r\nbe beyond the scope of this work; and we now return to consider the\r\ncareer of Bonaparte as a statesman.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief stay at Milan and Turin, where he was received as the\r\nliberator of Italy, the First Consul crossed the Alps by the Mont\r\nCenis pass and was received with rapturous acclaim at Lyons and Paris.\r\nHe had been absent from the capital less than two calendar months.\r\n\r\nHe now sent a letter to the Czar Paul, offering that, if the French\r\ngarrison of Malta were compelled by famine to evacuate that island, he\r\nwould place it in the hands of the Czar, as Grand Master of the\r\nKnights of St. John. Rarely has a \"Greek gift\" been more skilfully\r\ntendered. In the first place, Valetta was so closely blockaded by\r\nNelson's cruisers and invested by the native Maltese that its\r\nsurrender might be expected in a few weeks; and the First Consul was\r\nwell aware how anxiously the Czar had been seeking to gain a foothold\r\nat Malta, whence he could menace Turkey from the south-east. In his\r\nwish completely to gain over Russia, Bonaparte also sent back,\r\nwell-clad and well-armed, the prisoners taken from the Russian armies\r\nin 1799, a step which was doubly appreciated at Petersburg because the\r\nRussian troops which had campaigned with the Duke of York in Holland\r\nwere somewhat shabbily treated by the British Government in the\r\nChannel Islands, where they took up their winter quarters. Accordingly\r\nthe Czar now sent Kalicheff to Paris, for the formation of a\r\nFranco-Russian alliance. He was warmly received. Bonaparte promised in\r\ngeneral terms to restore the King of Sardinia to his former realm and\r\nthe Pope to his States. On his side, the Czar sent the alluring advice\r\nto Bonaparte to found a dynasty and thereby put an end to the\r\nrevolutionary principles which had armed Europe against France. He\r\nalso offered to recognize the natural frontiers of France, the Rhine\r\nand the Maritime Alps, and claimed that German affairs should be\r\nregulated under his own mediation. When both parties were so\r\ncomplaisant, a bargain was easily arranged. France and Russia\r\naccordingly joined hands in order to secure predominance in the\r\naffairs of Central and Southern Europe, and to counterbalance\r\nEngland's supremacy at sea.\r\n\r\nFor it was not enough to break up the Second Coalition and recover\r\nNorthern Italy. Bonaparte's policy was more than European; it was\r\noceanic. England must be beaten on her own element: then and then only\r\ncould the young warrior secure his grasp on Egypt and return to his\r\noriental schemes. His correspondence before and after the Marengo\r\ncampaign reveals his eagerness for a peace with Austria and an\r\nalliance with Russia. His thoughts constantly turn to Egypt. He\r\nbargains with Britain that his army there may be revictualled, and so\r\nwords his claim that troops can easily be sent also. Lord Grenville\r\nrefuses (September 10th); whereupon Bonaparte throws himself eagerly\r\ninto further plans for the destruction of the islanders. He seeks to\r\ninflame the Czar's wrath against the English maritime code. His\r\nsuccess for the time is complete. At the close of 1800 the Russian\r\nEmperor marshals the Baltic Powers for the overthrow of England's\r\nnavy, and outstrips Bonaparte's wildest hopes by proposing a\r\nFranco-Russian invasion of India with a view to \"dealing his enemy a\r\nmortal blow.\" This plan, as drawn up at the close of 1800, arranged\r\nfor the mustering of 35,000 Russians at Astrakan; while as many French\r\nwere to fight their way to the mouth of the Danube, set sail on\r\nRussian ships for the Sea of Azov, join their allies on the Caspian\r\nSea, sail to its southern extremity, and, rousing the Persians and\r\nAfghans by the hope of plunder, sweep the British from India. The\r\nscheme received from Bonaparte a courteous perusal; but he subjected\r\nit to several criticisms, which led to less patient rejoinders from\r\nthe irascible potentate. Nevertheless, Paul began to march his troops\r\ntowards the lower Volga, and several polks of Cossacks had crossed\r\nthat river on the ice, when the news of his assassination cut short\r\nthe scheme.[147]\r\n\r\nThe grandiose schemes of Paul vanished with their fantastic contriver;\r\nbut the _rapprochement_ of Russia to revolutionary France was\r\nultimately to prove an event of far-reaching importance; for the\r\neastern power thereby began to exert on the democracy of western\r\nEurope that subtle, semi-Asiatic influence which has so powerfully\r\nwarped its original character.\r\n\r\nThe dawn of the nineteenth century witnessed some startling\r\nrearrangements on the political chess-board.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Bonaparte brought Russia and France to sudden amity, the\r\nunbending maritime policy of Great Britain leagued the Baltic Powers\r\nagainst the mistress of the seas. In the autumn of 1800 the Czar Paul,\r\nafter hearing of our capture of Malta, forthwith revived the Armed\r\nNeutrality League of 1780 and opposed the forces of Russia, Prussia,\r\nSweden, and Denmark to the might of England's navy. But Nelson's\r\nbrilliant success at Copenhagen and the murder of the Czar by a palace\r\nconspiracy shattered this league only four months after its formation,\r\nand the new Czar, Alexander, reverted for a time to friendship with\r\nEngland.[148] This sudden ending to the first Franco-Russia alliance\r\nso enraged Bonaparte that he caused a paragraph to be inserted in the\r\nofficial \"Moniteur,\" charging the British Government with procuring\r\nthe assassination of Paul, an insinuation that only proclaimed his\r\nrage at this sudden rebuff to his hitherto successful diplomacy.\r\nThough foiled for a time, he never lost sight of the hoped-for\r\nalliance, which, with a deft commixture of force and persuasion, he\r\ngained seven years later after the crushing blow of Friedland.\r\n\r\nDread of a Franco-Russian alliance undoubtedly helped to compel\r\nAustria to a peace. Humbled by Moreau at the great battle of\r\nHohenlinden, the Emperor Francis opened negotiations at Lunéville in\r\nLorraine. The subtle obstinacy of Cobenzl there found its match in the\r\nfirm yet suave diplomacy of Joseph Bonaparte, who wearied out Cobenzl\r\nhimself, until the march of Moreau towards Vienna compelled Francis to\r\naccept the River Adige as his boundary in Italy. The other terms of\r\nthe treaty (February 9th, 1801) were practically the same as those of\r\nthe treaty of Campo Formio, save that the Hapsburg Grand Duke of\r\nTuscany was compelled to surrender his State to a son of the Bourbon\r\nDuke of Parma. He himself was to receive \"compensation\" in Germany,\r\nwhere also the unfortunate Duke of Modena was to find consolation in\r\nthe district of the Breisgau on the Upper Rhine. The helplessness of\r\nthe old Holy Roman Empire was, indeed, glaringly displayed; for\r\nFrancis now admitted the right of the French to interfere in the\r\nrearrangement of that medley of States. He also recognized the\r\nCisalpine, Ligurian, Helvetic, and Batavian Republics, as at present\r\nconstituted; but their independence, and the liberty of their peoples\r\nto choose what form of government they thought fit, were expressly\r\nstipulated.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Naples also made peace with France by the treaty of\r\nFlorence (March, 1801), whereby it withdrew its troops from the States\r\nof the Church, and closed its ports to British and Turkish ships; it\r\nalso renounced in favour of the French Republic all its claims over a\r\nmaritime district of Tuscany known as the Présidii, the little\r\nprincipality of Piombino, and a port in the Isle of Elba. These\r\ncessions fitted in well with Napoleon's schemes for the proposed\r\nelevation of the heir of the Duchy of Parma to the rank of King of\r\nTuscany or Etruria. The King of Naples also pledged himself to admit\r\nand support a French corps in his dominions. Soult with 10,000 troops\r\nthereupon occupied Otranto, Taranto, and Brindisi, in order to hold\r\nthe Neapolitan Government to its engagements, and to facilitate French\r\nintercourse with Egypt.\r\n\r\nIn his relations with the New World Bonaparte had also prospered.\r\nCertain disputes between France and the United States had led to\r\nhostilities in the year 1798. Negotiations for peace were opened in\r\nMarch, 1800, and led to the treaty of Morfontaine, which enabled\r\nBonaparte to press on the Court of Madrid the scheme of the\r\nParma-Louisiana exchange, that promised him a magnificent empire on\r\nthe banks of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThese and other grandiose designs were confided only to Talleyrand and\r\nother intimate counsellors. But, even to the mass of mankind, the\r\ntransformation scene ushered in by the nineteenth century was one of\r\nbewildering brilliance. Italy from the Alps to her heel controlled by\r\nthe French; Austria compelled to forego all her Italian plans;\r\nSwitzerland and Holland dominated by the First Consul's influence;\r\nSpain following submissively his imperious lead; England, despite all\r\nher naval triumphs, helpless on land; and France rapidly regaining\r\nmore than all her old prestige and stability under the new\r\ninstitutions which form the most enduring tribute to the First\r\nConsul's glory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE NEW INSTITUTIONS OF FRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We have done with the romance of the Revolution: we must now commence\r\nits history. We must have eyes only for what is real and practicable\r\nin the application of principles, and not for the speculative and\r\nhypothetical.\" Such were the memorable words of Bonaparte to his\r\nCouncil of State at one of its early meetings. They strike the keynote\r\nof the era of the Consulate. It was a period of intensely practical\r\nactivity that absorbed all the energies of France and caused the\r\nearlier events of the Revolution to fade away into a seemingly remote\r\npast. The failures of the civilian rulers and the military triumphs of\r\nBonaparte had exerted a curious influence on the French character,\r\nwhich was in a mood of expectant receptivity. In 1800 everything was\r\nin the transitional state that favours the efforts of a master\r\nbuilder; and one was now at hand whose constructive ability in civil\r\naffairs equalled his transcendent genius for war.\r\n\r\nI propose here briefly to review the most important works of\r\nreconstruction which render the Consulate and the early part of the\r\nEmpire for ever famous. So vast and complex were Bonaparte's efforts\r\nin this field that they will be described, not chronologically, but\r\nsubject by subject. The reader will, however, remember that for the\r\nmost part they went on side by side, even amidst the distractions\r\ncaused by war, diplomacy, colonial enterprises, and the myriad details\r\nof a vast administration. What here appears as a series of canals was\r\nin reality a mighty river of enterprise rolling in undivided volume\r\nand fed by the superhuman vitality of the First Consul. It was his\r\ninexhaustible curiosity which compelled functionaries to reveal the\r\nsecrets of their office: it was his intelligence that seized on the\r\nsalient points of every problem and saw the solution: it was his\r\nardour and mental tenacity which kept his Ministers and committees\r\nhard at work, and by toil of sometimes twenty hours a day supervised\r\nthe results: it was, in fine, his passion for thoroughness, his\r\nambition for France, that nerved every official with something of his\r\nown contempt of difficulties, until, as one of them said, \"the\r\ngigantic entered into our very habits of thought.\"[149]\r\n\r\nThe first question of political reconstruction which urgently claimed\r\nattention was that of local government. On the very day when it was\r\ncertain that the nation had accepted the new constitution, the First\r\nConsul presented to the Legislature a draft of a law for regulating\r\nthe affairs of the Departments. It must be admitted that local\r\nself-government, as instituted by the men of 1789 in their\r\nDepartmental System, had proved a failure. In that time of buoyant\r\nhope, when every difficulty and abuse seemed about to be charmed away\r\nby the magic of universal suffrage, local self-government of a most\r\nadvanced type had been intrusted to an inexperienced populace. There\r\nwere elections for the commune or parish, elections for the canton,\r\nelections for the district, elections for the Department, and\r\nelections for the National Assembly, until the rustic brain, after\r\nreeling with excitement, speedily fell back into muddled apathy and\r\nleft affairs generally to the wire-pullers of the nearest Jacobin\r\nclub. A time of great confusion ensued. Law went according to local\r\nopinion, and the national taxes were often left unpaid. In the Reign\r\nof Terror this lax system was replaced by the despotism of the secret\r\ncommittees, and the way was thus paved for a return to organized\r\ncentral control, such as was exercised by the Directory.\r\n\r\nThe First Consul, as successor to the Directory, therefore found\r\nmatters ready to his hand for a drastic measure of centralization, and\r\nit is curious to notice that the men of 1789 had unwittingly cleared\r\nthe ground for him. To make way for the \"supremacy of the general\r\nwill,\" they abolished the _Parlements_, which had maintained the old\r\nlaws, customs, and privileges of their several provinces, and had\r\nfrequently interfered in purely political matters. The abolition of\r\nthese and other privileged corporations in 1789 unified France and\r\nleft not a single barrier to withstand either the flood of democracy\r\nor the backwash of reaction. Everything therefore favoured the action\r\nof the First Consul in drawing all local powers under his own control.\r\nFrance was for the moment weary of elective bodies, that did little\r\nexcept waste the nation's taxes; and though there was some opposition\r\nto the new proposal, it passed on February 16th, 1800 (28 Pluviose,\r\nan, viii).\r\n\r\nIt substituted local government by the central power for local\r\nself-government. The local divisions remained the same, except that\r\nthe \"districts,\" abolished by the Convention, were now reconstituted\r\non a somewhat larger scale, and were termed _arrondissements_, while\r\nthe smaller communes, which had been merged in the cantons since 1795,\r\nwere also revived. It is noteworthy that, of all the areas mapped out\r\nby the Constituent Assembly in 1789-90, only the Department and canton\r\nhave had a continuous existence--a fact which seems to show the peril\r\nof tampering with well-established boundaries, and of carving out a\r\nlarge number of artificial districts, which speedily become the\r\n_corpus vile_ of other experimenters. Indeed, so little was there of\r\neffective self-government that France seems to have sighed with relief\r\nwhen order was imposed by Bonaparte in the person of a Prefect. This\r\nimportant official, a miniature First Consul, was to administer the\r\naffairs of the Department, while sub-prefects were similarly placed\r\nover the new _arrondissements_, and mayors over the communes. The\r\nmayors were appointed by the First Consul in communes of more than\r\n5,000 souls: by the prefects in the smaller communes: all were alike\r\nresponsible to the central power.\r\n\r\nThe rebound from the former electoral system, which placed all local\r\nauthority ultimately in the hands of the voters, was emphasized by\r\nArticle 75 of the constitution, which virtually raised officials\r\nbeyond reach of prosecution. It ran thus: \"The agents of the\r\nGovernment, other than the Ministers, cannot be prosecuted for facts\r\nrelating to their duties except by a decision of the Council of State:\r\nin that case the prosecution takes place before the ordinary\r\ntribunals.\" Now, as this decision rested with a body composed almost\r\nentirely of the higher officials, it will be seen that the chance of\r\na public prosecution of an official became extremely small. France was\r\ntherefore in the first months of 1800 handed over to a hierarchy of\r\nofficials closely bound together by interest and _esprit de corps_;\r\nand local administration, after ten years of democratic experiments,\r\npractically reverted to what it had been under the old monarchy. In\r\nfact, the powers of the Prefects were, on the whole, much greater than\r\nthose of the royal Intendants: for while the latter were hampered by\r\nthe provincial _Parlements_, the nominees of the First Consul had to\r\ndeal with councils that retained scarce the shadow of power. The real\r\nauthority in local matters rested with the Prefects. The old elective\r\nbodies survived, it is true, but their functions were now mainly\r\nadvisory; and, lest their advice should be too copious, the sessions\r\nof the first two bodies were limited to a fortnight a year. Except for\r\na share in the assessment of taxation, their existence was merely a\r\nscreen to hide the reality of the new central despotism.[150]\r\nBeneficent it may have been; and the choice of Prefects was certainly\r\na proof of Bonaparte's discernment of real merit among men of all\r\nshades of opinion; but for all that, it was a despotism, and one that\r\nhas inextricably entwined itself with the whole life of France.[151]\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that this law should not have aroused fierce\r\nopposition; for it practically gagged democracy in its most\r\nappropriate and successful sphere of action, local self-government,\r\nand made popular election a mere shadow, except in the single act of\r\nthe choice of the local _juges de paix_. This was foreseen by the\r\nLiberals in the Tribunate: but their power was small since the\r\nregulations passed in January: and though Daunou, as \"reporter,\"\r\nsharply criticised this measure, yet he lamely concluded with the\r\nadvice that it would be dangerous to reject it. The Tribunes therefore\r\npassed the proposal by 71 votes to 25: and the Corps Législatif by 217\r\nto 68.\r\n\r\nThe results of this new local government have often been considered so\r\nfavourable as to prove that the genius of the French people requires\r\ncentral control rather than self-government. But it should be noted\r\nthat the conditions of France from 1790 to 1800 were altogether\r\nhostile to the development of free institutions. The fierce feuds at\r\nhome, the greed and the class jealousies awakened by confiscation, the\r\nblasts of war and the blight of bankruptcy, would have severely tested\r\nthe firmest of local institutions; they were certain to wither so\r\ndelicate an organism as an absolute democracy, which requires peace,\r\nprosperity, and infinite patience for its development. Because France\r\nthen came to despair of her local self-government, it did not follow\r\nthat she would fail after Bonaparte's return had restored her prestige\r\nand prosperity. But the national _élan_ forbade any postponement or\r\ncompromise; and France forthwith accepted the rule of an able official\r\nhierarchy as a welcome alternative to the haphazard acts of local\r\nbusybodies. By many able men the change has been hailed as a proof of\r\nBonaparte's marvellous discernment of the national character, which,\r\nas they aver, longs for brilliance, order, and strong government,\r\nrather than for the steep and thorny paths of liberty. Certainly there\r\nis much in the modern history of France which supports this opinion.\r\nYet perhaps these characteristics are due very largely to the master\r\ncraftsman, who fashioned France anew when in a state of receptivity,\r\nand thus was able to subject democracy to that force which alone has\r\nbeen able to tame it--the mighty force of militarism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe return to a monarchical policy was nowhere more evident than in\r\nthe very important negotiations which regulated the relations of\r\nChurch and State and produced the _Concordat_ or treaty of peace with\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church. But we must first look back at the events\r\nwhich had reduced the Roman Catholic Church in France to its pitiable\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the revolutionists towards the Church of France was\r\nactuated partly by the urgent needs of the national exchequer, partly\r\nby hatred and fear of so powerful a religious corporation. Idealists\r\nof the new school of thought, and practical men who dreaded\r\nbankruptcy, accordingly joined in the assault on its property and\r\nprivileges: its tithes were confiscated, the religious houses and\r\ntheir property were likewise absorbed, and its lands were declared to\r\nbe the lands of the nation. A budget of public worship was, it is\r\ntrue, designed to support the bishops and priests; but this solemn\r\nobligation was soon renounced by the fiercer revolutionists. Yet\r\nrobbery was not their worst offence. In July, 1790, they passed a law\r\ncalled the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, which aimed at subjecting\r\nthe Church to the State. It compelled bishops and priests to seek\r\nelection by the adult males of their several Departments and parishes,\r\nand forced them to take a stringent oath of obedience to the new order\r\nof things. All the bishops but four refused to take an oath which set\r\nat naught the authority of the Pope: more than 50,000 priests likewise\r\nrefused, and were ejected from their livings: the recusants were\r\ntermed _orthodox_ or _non-juring_ priests, and by the law of August,\r\n1792, they were exiled from France, while their more pliable or\r\ntime-serving brethren who accepted the new decree were known as\r\n_constitutionals_. About 12,000 of the constitutionals married, while\r\nsome of them applauded the extreme Jacobinical measures of the Terror.\r\nOne of them shocked the faithful by celebrating the mysteries, having\r\na _bonnet rouge_ on his head, holding a pike in his hand, while his\r\nwife was installed near the altar.[152] Outrages like these were rare:\r\nbut they served to discredit the constitutional Church and to throw up\r\nin sharper relief the courage with which the orthodox clergy met exile\r\nand death for conscience' sake. Moreover, the time-serving of the\r\nconstitutionals was to avail them little: during the Terror their\r\nstipends were unpaid, and the churches were for the most part closed.\r\nAfter a partial respite in 1795-6, the _coup d'état_ of Fructidor\r\n(1797) again ushered in two years of petty persecutions; but in the\r\nearly summer of 1799 constitutionals were once more allowed to observe\r\nthe Christian Sunday, and at the time of Bonaparte's return from\r\nEgypt their services were more frequented than those of the\r\nTheophilanthropists on the _décadis_. It was evident, then, that the\r\nanti-religious _furor_ had burnt itself out, and that France was\r\nturning back to her old faith. Indeed, outside Paris and a few other\r\nlarge towns, public opinion mocked at the new cults, and in the\r\ncountry districts the peasantry clung with deep affection to their old\r\northodox priests, often following them into the forests to receive\r\ntheir services and forsaking those of their supplanters.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was the religious state of France in 1799: her clergy were\r\nrent by a formidable schism; the orthodox priests clung where possible\r\nto their parishioners, or lived in destitution abroad; the\r\nconstitutional priests, though still frowned on by the Directory, were\r\ngaining ground at the expense of the Theophilanthropists, whose\r\nexpiring efforts excited ridicule. In fine, a nation weary of\r\nreligious experiments and groping about for some firm anchorage in the\r\nmidst of the turbid ebb-tide and its numerous backwaters.[153]\r\n\r\nDespite the absence of any deep religious belief, Bonaparte felt the\r\nneed of religion as the bulwark of morality and the cement of society.\r\nDuring his youth he had experienced the strength of Romanism in\r\nCorsica, and during his campaigns in Italy he saw with admiration the\r\nzeal of the French orthodox priests who had accepted exile and poverty\r\nfor conscience' sake. To these outcasts he extended more protection\r\nthan was deemed compatible with correct republicanism; and he received\r\ntheir grateful thanks. After Brumaire he suppressed the oath\r\npreviously exacted from the clergy, and replaced it by a _promise_ of\r\nfidelity to the constitution. Many reasons have been assigned for this\r\nconduct, but doubtless his imagination was touched by the sight of the\r\nmajestic hierarchy of Rome, whose spiritual powers still prevailed,\r\neven amidst the ruin of its temporal authority, and were slowly but\r\nsurely winning back the ground lost in the Revolution. An influence so\r\nimpalpable yet irresistible, that inherited from the Rome of the\r\nCæsars the gift of organization and the power of maintaining\r\ndiscipline, in which the Revolution was so signally lacking, might\r\nwell be the ally of the man who now dominated the Latin peoples. The\r\npupil of Cæsar could certainly not neglect the aid of the spiritual\r\nhierarchy, which was all that remained of the old Roman grandeur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdded to this was his keen instinct for reality, which led him to\r\nscorn such whipped-up creeds as Robespierre's Supreme Being and that\r\namazing hybrid, Theophilanthropy, offspring of the Goddess of Reason\r\nand La Réveillière-Lépeaux. Having watched their manufacture, rise and\r\nfall, he felt the more regard for the faith of his youth, which\r\nsatisfied one of the most imperious needs of his nature, a craving for\r\ncertainty. Witness this crushing retort to M. Mathieu: \"What is your\r\nTheophilanthropy? Oh, don't talk to me of a religion which only takes\r\nme for this life, without telling me whence I come or whither I go.\"\r\nOf course, this does not prove the reality of Napoleon's religion; but\r\nit shows that he was not devoid of the religious instinct.\r\n\r\nThe victory of Marengo enabled Bonaparte to proceed with his plans for\r\nan accommodation with the Vatican; and he informed one of the Lombard\r\nbishops that he desired to open friendly relations with Pope Pius\r\nVII., who was then about to make his entry into Rome. There he\r\nreceived the protection of the First Consul, and soon recovered his\r\nsovereignty over his States, excepting the Legations.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations between Paris and the Vatican were transacted chiefly\r\nby a very able priest, Bernier by name, who had gained the First\r\nConsul's confidence during the pacification of Brittany, and now urged\r\non the envoys of Rome the need of deferring to all that was reasonable\r\nin the French demands. The negotiators for the Vatican were Cardinals\r\nConsalvi and Caprara, and Monseigneur Spina--able ecclesiastics, who\r\nwere fitted to maintain clerical claims with that mixture of\r\nsuppleness and firmness which had so often baffled the force and craft\r\nof mighty potentates. The first difficulty arose on the question of\r\nthe resignation of bishops of the Gallican Church: Bonaparte demanded\r\nthat, whether orthodox or constitutionals, they must resign their sees\r\ninto the Pope's hands; failing that, they must be deposed by the papal\r\nauthority. Sweeping as this proposal seemed, Bonaparte claimed that\r\nbishops of both sides must resign, in order that a satisfactory\r\nselection might be made. Still more imperious was the need that the\r\nChurch should renounce all claim to her confiscated domains. All\r\nclasses of the community, so urged Bonaparte, had made immense\r\nsacrifices during the Revolution; and now that peasants were settled\r\non these once clerical lands, the foundations of society would be\r\nbroken up by any attempt to dispossess them.\r\n\r\nTo both of these proposals the Court of Rome offered a tenacious\r\nresistance. The idea of compelling long-persecuted bishops to resign\r\ntheir sees was no less distasteful than the latter proposal, which\r\ninvolved acquiescence in sacrilegious robbery. At least, pleaded Mgr.\r\nSpina, let tithes be re-established. To this request the First Consul\r\ndeigned no reply. None, indeed, was possible except a curt refusal.\r\nFew imposts had been so detested as the tithe; and its reimposition\r\nwould have wounded the peasant class, on which the First Consul based\r\nhis authority. So long as he had their support he could treat with\r\ndisdain the scoffs of the philosophers and even the opposition of his\r\nofficers; but to have wavered on the subject of tithe and of the\r\nChurch lands might have been fatal even to the victor of Marengo.[154]\r\n\r\nIn fact, the difficulty of effecting any compromise was enormous. In\r\nseeking to reconcile the France of Rousseau and Robespierre to the\r\nunchanging policy of the Vatican, the \"heir to the Revolution\" was\r\nessaying a harder task than any military enterprise. To slay men has\r\never been easier than to mould their thoughts anew; and Bonaparte was\r\nnow striving not only to remould French thought but also to fashion\r\nanew the ideas of the Eternal City. He soon perceived that this latter\r\nenterprise was more difficult than the former. The Pope and his\r\ncouncillors rejoiced at the signs of his repentance, but required to\r\nsee the fruits thereof. Instead of first-fruits they received\r\nunheard-of demands--the surrender of the three Legations of Bologna,\r\nFerrara, and Romagna, the renunciation of all tithes and Church lands\r\nin France, and the acceptance of a compromise with schismatics. What\r\nwonder that the replies from Rome were couched in the _non possumus_\r\nterms which form the last refuge of the Vatican. Finding that\r\nnegotiations made no progress, Bonaparte intrusted Berthier and Murat\r\nto pay a visit to Rome and exercise a discreet but burdensome pressure\r\nin the form of requisitions for the French troops in the Papal States.\r\n\r\nThe ratification of peace with Austria gave greater weight to his\r\nrepresentations at Rome, and he endeavoured to press on the signature\r\nof the Concordat, so as to startle the world by the simultaneous\r\nannouncement of the pacification of the Continent and of the healing\r\nof the great religious schism in France. But the clerical machinery\r\nworked too slowly to admit of this projected _coup de théâtre_. In\r\nBonaparte's proposals of February 25th, 1801, there were several\r\ndemands already found to be inadmissible at the Vatican;[155] and\r\nmatters came to a deadlock until the Pope invested Spina with larger\r\npowers for negotiating at Paris. Consalvi also proceeded to Paris,\r\nwhere he was received in state with other ambassadors at the\r\nTuileries, the sight of a cardinal's robe causing no little sensation.\r\nThe First Consul granted him a long interview, speaking at first\r\nsomewhat seriously, but gradually becoming more affable and gracious.\r\nYet as his behaviour softened his demands stiffened; and at the close\r\nof the audience he pressed Consalvi to sign a somewhat unfavourable\r\nversion of the compact within five days, otherwise the negotiations\r\nwould be at an end and a _national religion would be adopted_--an\r\nenterprise for which the auguries promised complete success. At a\r\nlater interview he expressed the same resolution in homely phrase:\r\nwhen Consalvi pressed him to take a firm stand against the\r\n\"constitutional\" intruders, he laughingly remarked that he could do no\r\nmore until he knew how he stood with Rome; for \"you know that when\r\none cannot arrange matters with God, one comes to terms with the\r\ndevil.\"[156]\r\n\r\nThis dalliance with the \"constitutionals\" might have been more than an\r\nastute ruse, and Consalvi knew it. In framing a national Church the\r\nFirst Consul would have appealed not only to the old Gallican feeling,\r\nstill strong among the clerics and laity, but also to the potent force\r\nof French nationality. The experiment might have been managed so as to\r\noffend none but the strictest Catholics, who were less to be feared\r\nthan the free-thinkers. Consalvi was not far wrong when, writing of\r\nthe official world at Paris, he said that only Bonaparte really\r\ndesired a Concordat.\r\n\r\nThe First Consul's motives in seeking the alliance of Rome have, very\r\nnaturally, been subjected to searching criticism; and in forcing the\r\nConcordat on France, and also on Rome, he was certainly undertaking\r\nthe most difficult negotiation of his life.[157] But his preference\r\nfor the Roman connection was an act of far-reaching statecraft. He saw\r\nthat a national Church, unrecognized by Rome, was a mere half-way\r\nhouse between Romanism and Protestantism; and he disliked the latter\r\ncreed because of its tendency to beget sects and to impair the\r\nvalidity of the general will. He still retained enough of Rousseau's\r\ndoctrine to desire that the general will should be uniform, provided\r\nthat it could be controlled by his own will. Such uniformity in the\r\nsphere of religion was impossible unless he had the support of the\r\nPapacy. Only by a bargain with Rome could he gain the support of a\r\nsolid ecclesiastical phalanx. Finally, by erecting a French national\r\nChurch, he would not only have perpetuated schism at home, but would\r\nhave disqualified himself for acting the part of Charlemagne over\r\ncentral and southern Europe. To re-fashion Europe in a cosmopolitan\r\nmould he needed a clerical police that was more than merely French. To\r\nachieve those grander designs the successor of Cæsar would need the\r\naid of the successor of Peter; and this aid would be granted only to\r\nthe restorer of Roman Catholicism in France, never to the perpetuator\r\nof schism.\r\n\r\nThese would seem to be the chief reasons why he braved public opinion\r\nin Paris and clung to the Roman connection, bringing forward his plan\r\nof a Gallican Church only as a threatening move against the clerical\r\nflank. When the Vatican was obdurate he coquetted with the\r\n\"constitutional\" bishops, allowing them every facility for free speech\r\nin a council which they held at Paris at the close of June, 1801. He\r\nsummoned to the Tuileries their president, the famous Grégoire, and\r\nshowed him signal marks of esteem. \"Put not your trust in princes\"\r\nmust soon have been the thought of Grégoire and his colleagues: for a\r\nfortnight later Bonaparte carried through his treaty with Rome and\r\nshelved alike the congress and the church of the \"constitutionals.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to detail all the steps in this complex\r\nnegotiation, but the final proceedings call for some notice. When the\r\ntreaty was assuming its final form, Talleyrand, the polite scoffer,\r\nthe bitter foe of all clerical claims, found it desirable to take the\r\nbaths at a distant place, and left the threads of the negotiation in\r\nthe hands of two men who were equally determined to prevent its\r\nsignature, Maret, Secretary of State, and Hauterive, who afterwards\r\nbecome the official archivist of France. These men determined to\r\nsubmit to Consalvi a draft of the treaty differing widely from that\r\nwhich had been agreed upon; and that, too, when the official\r\nannouncement had been made that the treaty was to be signed\r\nimmediately. In the last hours the cardinal found himself confronted\r\nwith unexpected conditions, many of which he had successfully\r\nrepelled. Though staggered by this trickery, which compelled him to\r\nsign a surrender or to accept an open rupture, Consalvi fought the\r\nquestion over again in a conference that lasted twenty-four hours; he\r\neven appeared at the State dinner given on July 14th by the First\r\nConsul, who informed him before the other guests that it was a\r\nquestion of \"my draft of the treaty or none at all.\" Nothing baffled\r\nthe patience and tenacity of the Cardinal; and finally, by the good\r\noffices of Joseph Bonaparte, the objectionable demands thrust forward\r\nat the eleventh hour were removed or altered.\r\n\r\nThe question has been discussed whether the First Consul was a party\r\nto this device. Theiner asserts that he knew nothing of it: that it\r\nwas an official intrigue got up at the last moment by the\r\nanti-clericals so as to precipitate a rupture. In support of this\r\nview, he cites letters of Maret and Hauterive as inculpating these men\r\nand tending to free Bonaparte from suspicion of complicity. But the\r\nletters cannot be said to dissipate all suspicion. The First Consul\r\nhad made this negotiation peculiarly his own: no officials assuredly\r\nwould have dared secretly to foist their own version of an important\r\ntreaty; or, if they did, this act would have been the last of their\r\ncareer. But Bonaparte did not disgrace them; on the contrary, he\r\ncontinued to honour them with his confidence. Moreover, the First\r\nConsul flew into a passion with his brother Joseph when he reported\r\nthat Consalvi could not sign the document now offered to him, and tore\r\nin pieces the articles finally arranged with the Cardinal. On the\r\nreturn of his usually calm intelligence, he at last allowed the\r\nconcessions to stand, with the exception of two; but in a scrutiny of\r\nmotives we must assign most importance, not to second and more prudent\r\nthoughts, but to the first ebullition of feelings, which seem\r\nunmistakably to prove his knowledge and approval of Hauterive's\r\ndevice. We must therefore conclude that he allowed the antagonists of\r\nthe Concordat to make this treacherous onset, with the intention of\r\nextorting every possible demand from the dazed and bewildered\r\nCardinal.[158]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter further delays the Concordat was ratified at Eastertide, 1802.\r\nIt may be briefly described as follows: The French Government\r\nrecognized that the Catholic apostolic and Roman religion was the\r\nreligion of the great majority of the French people, \"especially of\r\nthe Consuls\"; but it refused to declare it to be the religion of\r\nFrance, as was the case under the _ancien régime_. It was to be freely\r\nand publicly practised in France, subject to the police regulations\r\nthat the Government judged necessary for the public tranquillity. In\r\nreturn for these great advantages, many concessions were expected from\r\nthe Church. The present bishops, both orthodox and constitutional,\r\nwere, at the Pope's invitation, to resign their sees; or, failing\r\nthat, new appointments were to be made, as if the sees were vacant.\r\nThe last proviso was necessary; for of the eighty-one surviving\r\nbishops affected by this decision as many as thirteen orthodox and two\r\n\"constitutionals\" offered persistent but unavailing protests against\r\nthe action of the Pope and First Consul.\r\n\r\nA new division of archbishoprics and bishoprics was now made, which\r\ngave in all sixty sees to France. The First Consul enjoyed the right\r\nof nomination to them, whereupon the Pope bestowed canonical\r\ninvestiture. The archbishops and bishops were all to take an oath of\r\nfidelity to the constitution. The bishops nominated the lower clerics\r\nprovided that they were acceptable to the Government: all alike bound\r\nthemselves to watch over governmental interests. The stability of\r\nFrance was further assured by a clause granting complete and permanent\r\nsecurity to the holders of the confiscated Church lands--a healing and\r\nsalutary compromise which restored peace to every village and soothed\r\nthe qualms of many a troubled conscience. On its side, the State\r\nundertook to furnish suitable stipends to the clergy, a promise which\r\nwas fulfilled in a rather niggardly spirit. For the rest, the First\r\nConsul enjoyed the same consideration as the Kings of France in all\r\nmatters ecclesiastical; and a clause was added, though Bonaparte\r\ndeclared it needless, that if any succeeding First Consul were not a\r\nRoman Catholic, his prerogatives in religious matters should be\r\nrevised by a Convention. A similar Concordat was passed a little later\r\nfor the pacification of the Cisalpine Republic.\r\n\r\nThe Concordat was bitterly assailed by the Jacobins, especially by the\r\nmilitary chiefs, and had not the infidel generals been for the most\r\npart sundered by mutual jealousies they might perhaps have overthrown\r\nBonaparte. But their obvious incapacity for civil affairs enabled them\r\nto venture on nothing more than a few coarse jests and clumsy\r\ndemonstrations. At the Easter celebration at Notre Dame in honour of\r\nthe ratification of the Concordat, one of them, Delmas by name,\r\nventured on the only protest barbed with telling satire: \"Yes, a fine\r\npiece of monkery this, indeed. It only lacked the million men who got\r\nkilled to destroy what you are striving to bring back.\" But to all\r\nprotests Bonaparte opposed a calm behaviour that veiled a rigid\r\ndetermination, before which priests and soldiers were alike helpless.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent articles styled \"organic,\" Bonaparte, without consulting\r\nthe Pope, made several laws that galled the orthodox clergy. Under the\r\nplea of legislating for the police of public worship, he reaffirmed\r\nsome of the principles which he had been unable to incorporate in the\r\nConcordat itself. The organic articles asserted the old claims of the\r\nGallican Church, which forbade the application of Papal Bulls, or of\r\nthe decrees of \"foreign\" synods, to France: they further forbade the\r\nFrench bishops to assemble in council or synod without the permission\r\nof the Government; and this was also required for a bishop to leave\r\nhis diocese, even if he were summoned to Rome. Such were the chief of\r\nthe organic articles. Passed under the plea of securing public\r\ntranquillity, they proved a fruitful source of discord, which during\r\nthe Empire became so acute as to weaken Napoleon's authority. In\r\nmatters religious as well as political, he early revealed his chief\r\nmoral and mental defect, a determination to carry his point by\r\nwhatever means and to require the utmost in every bargain. While\r\nrefusing fully to establish Roman Catholicism as the religion of the\r\nState, he compelled the Church to surrender its temporalities, to\r\naccept the regulations of the State, and to protect its interests.\r\nTruly if, in Chateaubriand's famous phrase, he was the \"restorer of\r\nthe altars,\" he exacted the uttermost farthing for that restoration.\r\n\r\nIn one matter his clear intelligence stands forth in marked contrast\r\nto the narrow pedantry of the Roman Cardinals. At a time of\r\nreconciliation between orthodox and \"constitutionals,\" they required\r\nfrom the latter a complete and public retractation of their recent\r\nerrors. At once Bonaparte intervened with telling effect. So condign a\r\nhumiliation, he argued, would altogether mar the harmony newly\r\nre-established. \"The past is past: and the bishops and prefects ought\r\nto require from the priests only the declaration of adhesion to the\r\nConcordat, and of obedience to the bishop nominated by the First\r\nConsul and instituted by the Pope.\" This enlightened advice, backed up\r\nby irresistible power, carried the day, and some ten thousand\r\nconstitutional priests were quietly received back into the Roman\r\ncommunion, those who had contracted marriages being compelled to put\r\naway their wives. Bonaparte took a deep interest in the reconstruction\r\nof dioceses, in the naming of churches, and similar details, doubtless\r\nwith the full consciousness that the revival of the Roman religious\r\ndiscipline in France was a more important service than any feat of\r\narms.\r\n\r\nHe was right: in healing a great schism in France he was dealing a\r\ndeadly blow at the revolutionary feeling of which it was a prominent\r\nmanifestation. In the words of one of his Ministers, \"The Concordat\r\nwas the most brilliant triumph over the genius of Revolution, and all\r\nthe following successes have without exception resulted from it.\"[159]\r\n\r\nAfter this testimony it is needless to ask why Bonaparte did not take\r\nup with Protestantism. At St. Helena, it is true, he asserted that the\r\nchoice of Catholicism or Protestantism was entirely open to him in\r\n1801, and that the nation would have followed him in either direction:\r\nbut his religious policy, if carefully examined, shows no sign of\r\nwavering on this subject, though he once or twice made a strategic\r\ndiversion towards Geneva, when Rome showed too firm a front. Is it\r\nconceivable that a man who, as he informed Joseph, was systematically\r\nworking to found a dynasty, should hesitate in the choice of a\r\ngovernmental creed? Is it possible to think of the great champion of\r\nexternal control and State discipline as a defender of liberty of\r\nconscience and the right of private judgment?\r\n\r\nThe regulation of the Protestant cult in France was a far less arduous\r\ntask. But as Bonaparte's aim was to attach all cults to the State, he\r\ndecided to recognize the two chief Protestant bodies in France,\r\nCalvinists and Lutherans, allowing them to choose their own pastors\r\nand to regulate their affairs in consistories. The pastors were to be\r\nsalaried by the State, but in return the Government not only reserved\r\nits approval of every appointment, but required the Protestant bodies\r\nto have no relations whatever with any foreign Power or authority. The\r\norganic articles of 1802, which defined the position of the Protestant\r\nbodies, form a very important landmark in the history of the followers\r\nof Luther and Calvin. Persecuted by Louis XIV. and XV., they were\r\ntolerated by Louis XVI.; they gained complete religious equality\r\nin 1789, and after a few years of anarchy in matters of faith, they\r\nfound themselves suddenly and stringently bound to the State by the\r\norganizing genius of Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1806-1808 the position of the Jews was likewise defined,\r\nat least for all those who recognized France as their country,\r\nperformed all civic duties, and recognized all the laws of the State.\r\nIn consideration of their paying full taxes and performing military\r\nservice, they received official protection and their rabbis\r\ngovernmental support.\r\n\r\nSuch was Bonaparte's policy on religious subjects. There can be little\r\ndoubt that its motive was, in the main, political. This methodizing\r\ngenius, who looked on the beliefs and passions, the desires and\r\nambitions of mankind, as so many forces which were to aid him in his\r\nascent, had already satisfied the desires for military glory and\r\nmaterial prosperity; and in his bargain with Rome he now won the\r\nsupport of an organized priesthood, besides that of the smaller\r\nProtestant and Jewish communions. That he gained also peace and\r\nquietness for France may be granted, though it was at the expense\r\nof that mental alertness and independence which had been her chief\r\nintellectual glory; but none of his intimate acquaintances ever\r\ndoubted that his religion was only a vague sentiment, and his\r\nattendance at mass merely a compliment to his \"sacred\r\ngendarmerie.\"[l60]\r\n\r\nHaving dared and achieved the exploit of organizing religion in a\r\nhalf-infidel society, the First Consul was ready to undertake the\r\nalmost equally hazardous task of establishing an order of social\r\ndistinction, and that too in the very land where less than eight years\r\npreviously every title qualified its holder for the guillotine. For\r\nhis new experiment, the Legion of Honour, he could adduce only one\r\nprecedent in the acts of the last twelve years.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole tendency had been towards levelling all inequalities. In\r\n1790 all titles of nobility were swept away; and though the Convention\r\ndecreed \"arms of honour\" to brave soldiers, yet its generosity to the\r\ndeserving proved to be less remarkable than its activity in\r\nguillotining the unsuccessful. Bonaparte, however, adduced its custom\r\nof granting occasional modest rewards as a precedent for his own\r\ndesign, which was to be far more extended and ambitious.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1802, he proposed the formation of a Legion of Honour,\r\norganized in fifteen cohorts, with grand officers, commanders,\r\nofficers, and legionaries. Its affairs were to be regulated by a\r\ncouncil presided over by Bonaparte himself. Each cohort received\r\n\"national domains\" with 200,000 francs annual rental, and these funds\r\nwere disbursed to the members on a scale proportionate to their rank.\r\nThe men who had received \"arms of honour\" were, _ipso facto_ to be\r\nlegionaries; soldiers \"who had rendered considerable services to the\r\nState in the war of liberty,\" and civilians \"who by their learning,\r\ntalents, and virtues contributed to establish or to defend the\r\nprinciples of the Republic,\" might hope for the honour and reward now\r\nheld out. The idea of rewarding merit in a civilian, as well as among\r\nthe military caste which had hitherto almost entirely absorbed such\r\nhonours, was certainly enlightened; and the names of the famous\r\n_savants_ Laplace, Monge, Berthollet, Lagrange, Chaptal, and of\r\njurists such as Treilhard and Tronchet, imparted lustre to what would\r\notherwise have been a very commonplace institution. Bonaparte desired\r\nto call out all the faculties of the nation; and when Dumas proposed\r\nthat the order should be limited to soldiers, the First Consul\r\nreplied in a brilliant and convincing harangue:\r\n\r\n     \"To do great things nowadays it is not enough to be a man of five\r\n     feet ten inches. If strength and bravery made the general, every\r\n     soldier might claim the command. The general who does great things\r\n     is he who also possesses civil qualities. The soldier knows no law\r\n     but force, sees nothing but it, and measures everything by it. The\r\n     civilian, on the other hand, only looks to the general welfare. The\r\n     characteristic of the soldier is to wish to do everything\r\n     despotically: that of the civilian is to submit everything to\r\n     discussion, truth, and reason. The superiority thus unquestionably\r\n     belongs to the civilian.\"\r\n\r\nIn these noble words we can discern the secret of Bonaparte's\r\nsupremacy both in politics and in warfare. Uniting in his own person\r\nthe ablest qualities of the statesman and the warrior, he naturally\r\ndesired that his new order of merit should quicken the vitality of\r\nFrance in every direction, knowing full well that the results would\r\nspeedily be felt in the army itself. When admitted to its ranks, the\r\nnew member swore:\r\n\r\n     \"To devote himself to the service of the Republic, to the\r\n     maintenance of the integrity of its territory, the defence of its\r\n     government, laws, and of the property which they have consecrated;\r\n     to fight by all methods authorized by justice, reason, and law,\r\n     against every attempt to re-establish the feudal _régime_ or to\r\n     reproduce the titles and qualities thereto belonging; and finally\r\n     to strive to the uttermost to maintain liberty and equality.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that the Tribunate, despite the recent purging of\r\nits most independent members, judged liberty and equality to be\r\nendangered by the method of defence now proposed. The members bitterly\r\ncriticised the scheme as a device of the counter-revolution; but, with\r\nthe timid inconsequence which was already sapping their virility, they\r\nproceeded to pass by fifty-six votes to thirty-eight a measure of\r\nwhich they had so accurately gauged the results. The new institution\r\nwas, indeed, admirably suited to consolidate Bonaparte's power.\r\nResting on the financial basis of the confiscated lands, it offered\r\nsome guarantee against the restoration of the old monarchy and feudal\r\nnobility; while, by stimulating that love of distinction and\r\nbrilliance which is inherent in every gifted people, it quietly began\r\nto graduate society and to group it around the Paladins of a new\r\nGaulish chivalry. The people had recently cast off the overlordship of\r\nthe old Frankish nobles, but admiration of merit (the ultimate source\r\nof all titles of distinction) was only dormant even in the days of\r\nRobespierre; and its insane repression during the Terror now begat a\r\ncorresponding enthusiasm for all commanding gifts. Of this inevitable\r\nreaction Bonaparte now made skillful use. When Berlier, one of the\r\nleading jurists of France, objected to the new order as leading France\r\nback to aristocracy, and contemptuously said that crosses and ribbons\r\nwere the toys of monarchy, Bonaparte replied:\r\n\r\n     \"Well: men are led by toys. I would not say that in a rostrum, but\r\n     in a council of wise men and statesmen one ought to speak one's\r\n     mind. I don't think that the French love liberty and equality: the\r\n     French are not at all changed by ten years of revolution: they are\r\n     what the Gauls were, fierce and fickle. They have one\r\n     feeling--honour. We must nourish that feeling: they must have\r\n     distinctions. See how they bow down before the stars of\r\n     strangers.\"[161]\r\n\r\nAfter so frank an exposition of motives to his own Council of State,\r\nlittle more need be said. We need not credit Bonaparte or the orators\r\nof the Tribunate with any superhuman sagacity when he and they foresaw\r\nthat such an order would prepare the way for more resplendent titles.\r\nThe Legion of Honour, at least in its highest grades, was the\r\nchrysalis stage of the Imperial _noblesse_. After all, the new\r\nCharlemagne might plead that his new creation satisfied an innate\r\ncraving of the race, and that its durability was the best answer to\r\nhostile critics. Even when, in 1814, his Senators were offering the\r\ncrown of France to the heir of the Bourbons, they expressly stipulated\r\nthat the Legion of Honour should not be abolished: it has survived all\r\nthe shocks of French history, even the vulgarizing associations of\r\nthe Second Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe same quality of almost pyramidal solidity characterizes another\r\ngreat enterprise of the Napoleonic period, the codification of French\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of this undertaking consisted mainly in the enormous\r\nmass of decrees emanating from the National Assemblies, relative to\r\npolitical, civil, and criminal affairs. Many of those decrees, the\r\noffspring of a momentary enthusiasm, had found a place in the codes of\r\nlaws which were then compiled; and yet sagacious observers knew that\r\nseveral of them warred against the instincts of the Gallic race. This\r\nconviction was summed up in the trenchant statement of the compilers\r\nof the new code, in which they appealed from the ideas of Rousseau to\r\nthe customs of the past: \"New theories are but the maxims of certain\r\nindividuals: the old maxims represent the sense of centuries.\" There\r\nwas much force in this dictum. The overthrow of Feudalism and the old\r\nmonarchy had not permanently altered the French nature. They were\r\nstill the same joyous, artistic, clan-loving people whom the Latin\r\nhistorians described: and pride in the nation or the family was as\r\nclosely linked with respect for a doughty champion of national and\r\nfamily interests as in the days of Cæsar. Of this Roman or\r\nquasi-Gallic reaction Napoleon was to be the regulator; and no sphere\r\nof his activities bespeaks his unerring political sagacity more than\r\nhis sifting of the old and the new in the great code which was\r\nafterwards to bear his name.\r\n\r\nOld French law had been an inextricable labyrinth of laws and customs,\r\nmainly Roman and Frankish in origin, hopelessly tangled by feudal\r\ncustoms, provincial privileges, ecclesiastical rights, and the later\r\nundergrowth of royal decrees; and no part of the legislation of the\r\nrevolutionists met with so little resistance as their root and branch\r\ndestruction of this exasperating jungle. Their difficulties only began\r\nwhen they endeavoured to apply the principles of the Rights of Man to\r\npolitical, civil, and criminal affairs. The chief of these principles\r\nrelating to criminal law were that law can only forbid actions that\r\nare harmful to society, and must only impose penalties that are\r\nstrictly necessary. To these epoch-making pronouncements the Assembly\r\nadded, in 1790, that crimes should be visited only on the guilty\r\nindividual, not on the family; and that penalties must be proportioned\r\nto the offences. The last two of these principles had of late been\r\nflagrantly violated; but the general pacification of France now\r\npermitted a calm consideration of the whole question of criminal law,\r\nand of its application to normal conditions.\r\n\r\nCivil law was to be greatly influenced by the Rights of Man; but those\r\nfamous declarations were to a large extent contravened in the ensuing\r\ncivil strifes, and their application to real life was rendered\r\ninfinitely more difficult by that predominance of the critical over\r\nthe constructive faculties which marred the efforts of the\r\nrevolutionary Babel-builders. Indeed, such was the ardour of those\r\nenthusiasts that they could scarcely see any difficulties. Thus, the\r\nConvention in 1793 allowed its legislative committee just one month\r\nfor the preparation of a code of civil law. At the close of six weeks\r\nCambacérès, the reporter of the committee, was actually able to\r\nannounce that it was ready. It was found to be too complex. Another\r\ncommission was ordered to reconstruct it: this time the Convention\r\ndiscovered that the revised edition was too concise. Two other drafts\r\nwere drawn up at the orders of the Directory, but neither gave\r\nsatisfaction. And thus it was reserved for the First Consul to achieve\r\nwhat the revolutionists had only begun, building on the foundations\r\nand with the very materials which their ten years' toil had prepared.\r\n\r\nHe had many other advantages. The Second Consul, Cambacérès, was at\r\nhis side, with stores of legal experience and habits of complaisance\r\nthat were of the highest value. Then, too, the principles of personal\r\nliberty and social equality were yielding ground before the more\r\nautocratic maxims of Roman law. The view of life now dominant was that\r\nof the warrior not of the philosopher. Bonaparte named Tronchet, Bigot\r\nde Préameneu, and the eloquent and learned Portalis for the redaction\r\nof the code. By ceaseless toil they completed their first draft in\r\nfour months. Then, after receiving the criticisms of the Court of\r\nCassation and the Tribunals of Appeal, it came before the Council of\r\nState for the decision of its special committee on legislation. There\r\nit was subjected to the scrutiny of several experts, but, above all,\r\nto Bonaparte himself. He presided at more than half of the 102\r\nsittings devoted to this criticism; and sittings of eight or nine\r\nhours were scarcely long enough to satisfy his eager curiosity, his\r\nrelentless activity, and his determined practicality.\r\n\r\nFrom the notes of Thibaudeau one of the members of this revising\r\ncommittee, we catch a glimpse of the part there played by the First\r\nConsul. We see him listening intently to the discussions of the\r\njurists, taking up and sorting the threads of thought when a tangle\r\nseemed imminent, and presenting the result in some striking pattern.\r\nWe watch his methodizing spirit at work on the cumbrous legal\r\nphraseology, hammering it out into clear, ductile French. We feel the\r\nunerring sagacity, which acted as a political and social touchstone,\r\ntesting, approving, or rejecting multifarious details drawn from old\r\nFrench law or from the customs of the Revolution; and finally we\r\nwonder at the architectural skill which worked the 2,281 articles of\r\nthe Code into an almost unassailable pile. To the skill and patience\r\nof the three chief redactors that result is, of course, very largely\r\ndue: yet, in its mingling of strength, simplicity, and symmetry, we\r\nmay discern the projection of Napoleon's genius over what had hitherto\r\nbeen a legal chaos.\r\n\r\nSome blocks of the pyramid were almost entirely his own. He widened\r\nthe area of French citizenship; above all, he strengthened the\r\nstructure of the family by enhancing the father's authority. Herein\r\nhis Corsican instincts and the requirements of statecraft led him to\r\nundo much of the legislation of the revolutionists. Their ideal was\r\nindividual liberty: his aim was to establish public order by\r\nautocratic methods. They had sought to make of the family a little\r\nrepublic, founded on the principles of liberty and equality; but in\r\nthe new code the paternal authority reappeared no less strict, albeit\r\nless severe in some details than that of the _ancien régime._ The\r\nfamily was thenceforth modelled on the idea dominant in the State,\r\nthat authority and responsible action pertained to a single\r\nindividual. The father controlled the conduct of his children: his\r\nconsent was necessary for the marriage of sons up to their\r\ntwenty-fifth year, for that of daughters up to their twenty-first\r\nyear; and other regulations were framed in the same spirit.[162] Thus\r\nthere was rebuilt in France the institution of the family on an almost\r\nRoman basis; and these customs, contrasting sharply with the domestic\r\nanarchy of the Anglo-Saxon race, have had a mighty influence in\r\nfashioning the character of the French, as of the other Latin peoples,\r\nto a ductility that yields a ready obedience to local officials,\r\ndrill-sergeants, and the central Government.\r\n\r\nIn other respects Bonaparte's influence on the code was equally\r\npotent. He raised the age at which marriage could be legally\r\ncontracted to that of eighteen for men, and fifteen for women, and he\r\nprescribed a formula of obedience to be repeated by the bride to her\r\nhusband; while the latter was bound to protect and support the\r\nwife.[163]\r\n\r\nAnd yet, on the question of divorce, Bonaparte's action was\r\nsufficiently ambiguous to reawaken Josephine's fears; and the\r\ndetractors of the great man have some ground for declaring that his\r\naction herein was dictated by personal considerations. Others again\r\nmay point to the declarations of the French National Assemblies that\r\nthe law regarded marriage merely as a civil contract, and that divorce\r\nwas to be a logical sequel of individual liberty, \"which an\r\nindissoluble tie would annul.\" It is indisputable that extremely lax\r\ncustoms had been the result of the law of 1792, divorce being allowed\r\non a mere declaration of incompatibility of temper.[164] Against these\r\nscandals Bonaparte firmly set his face. But he disagreed with the\r\nframers of the new Code when they proposed altogether to prohibit\r\ndivorce, though such a proposition might well have seemed consonant\r\nwith his zeal for Roman Catholicism. After long debates it was decided\r\nto reduce the causes which could render divorce possible from nine to\r\nfour--adultery, cruelty, condemnation to a degrading penalty, and\r\nmutual consent--provided that this last demand should be persistently\r\nurged after not less than two years of marriage, and in no case was it\r\nto be valid after twenty years of marriage.[165]\r\n\r\nWe may also notice here that Bonaparte sought to surround the act of\r\nadoption with much solemnity, declaring it to be one of the grandest\r\nacts imaginable. Yet, lest marriage should thereby be discouraged,\r\ncelibates were expressly debarred from the privileges of adopting\r\nheirs. The precaution shows how keenly this able ruler peered into\r\nthe future. Doubtless, he surmised that in the future the population\r\nof France would cease to expand at the normal rate, owing to the\r\nworking of the law compelling the equal division of property among all\r\nthe children of a family. To this law he was certainly opposed.\r\nEquality in regard to the bequest of property was one of the sacred\r\nmaxims of revolutionary jurists, who had limited the right of free\r\ndisposal by bequest to one-tenth of each estate: nine-tenths being of\r\nnecessity divided equally among the direct heirs. Yet so strong was\r\nthe reaction in favour of the Roman principle of paternal authority,\r\nthat Bonaparte and a majority of the drafters of the new Code scrupled\r\nnot to assail that maxim, and to claim for the father larger\r\ndiscretionary powers over the disposal of his property. They demanded\r\nthat the disposable share should vary according to the wealth of the\r\ntestator--a remarkable proposal, which proves him to be anything but\r\nthe unflinching champion of revolutionary legal ideas which popular\r\nFrench histories have generally depicted him.\r\n\r\nThis proposal would have re-established liberty of bequest in its most\r\npernicious form, granting almost limitless discretionary power to the\r\nwealthy, while restricting or denying it to the poor.[166] Fortunately\r\nfor his reputation in France, the suggestion was rejected; and the\r\nlaw, as finally adopted, fixed the disposable share as one-half of the\r\nproperty, if there was but one heir; one-third, if there were two\r\nheirs; one-fourth, if there were three; and so on, diminishing as the\r\nsize of the family increased. This sliding scale, varying inversely\r\nwith the size of the family, is open to an obvious objection: it\r\ngranted liberty of bequest only in cases where the family was small,\r\nbut practically lapsed when the family attained to patriarchal\r\ndimensions. The natural result has been that the birth-rate has\r\nsuffered a serious and prolonged check in France. It seems certain\r\nthat the First Consul foresaw this result. His experience of peasant\r\nlife must have warned him that the law, even as now amended, would\r\nstunt the population of France and ultimately bring about that [Greek:\r\noliganthrôpia] which saps all great military enterprises. The great\r\ncaptain did all in his power to prevent the French settling down in a\r\nself-contained national life; he strove to stir them up to world-wide\r\nundertakings, and for the success of his future imperial schemes a\r\nredundant population was an absolute necessity.\r\n\r\nThe Civil Code became law in 1804: after undergoing some slight\r\nmodifications and additions, it was, in 1807 renamed the Code\r\nNapoléon. Its provisions had already, in 1806, been adopted in Italy.\r\nIn 1810 Holland, and the newly-annexed coast-line of the North Sea as\r\nfar as Hamburg, and even Lübeck on the Baltic, received it as the\r\nbasis of their laws, as did the Grand Duchy of Berg in 1811.\r\nIndirectly it has also exerted an immense influence on the legislation\r\nof Central and Southern Germany, Prussia, Switzerland, and Spain:\r\nwhile many of the Central and South American States have also\r\nborrowed its salient features.\r\n\r\nA Code of Civil Procedure was promulgated in France in 1806, one of\r\nCommerce in 1807, of \"Criminal Instruction\" in 1808, and a Penal Code\r\nin 1810. Except that they were more reactionary in spirit than the\r\nCivil Code, there is little that calls for notice here, the Penal Code\r\nespecially showing little advance in intelligence or clemency on the\r\nolder laws of France. Even in 1802, officials favoured severity after\r\nthe disorders of the preceding years. When Fox and Romilly paid a\r\nvisit to Talleyrand at Paris, they were informed by his secretary\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n     \"In his opinion nothing could restore good morals and order in the\r\n     country but 'la roue et la religion de nos ancêtres.' He knew, he\r\n     said, that the English did not think so, but we knew nothing of the\r\n     people. Fox was deeply shocked at the idea of restoring the wheel\r\n     as a punishment in France.\"[167]\r\n\r\nThis horrible punishment was not actually restored: but this extract\r\nfrom Romilly's diary shows what was the state of feeling in official\r\ncircles at Paris, and how strong was the reaction towards older ideas.\r\nThe reaction was unquestionably emphasized by Bonaparte's influence,\r\nand it is noteworthy that the Penal and other Codes, passed during the\r\nEmpire, were more reactionary than the laws of the Consulate. Yet,\r\neven as First Consul, he exerted an influence that began to banish the\r\ncustoms and traditions of the Revolution, except in the single sphere\r\nof material interests; and he satisfied the peasants' love of land and\r\nmoney in order that he might the more securely triumph over\r\nrevolutionary ideals and draw France insensibly back to the age of\r\nLouis XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the legislator must always keep in reserve punishment as the\r\n_ultima ratio_ for the lawless, he will turn by preference to\r\neducation as a more potent moralizing agency; and certainly education\r\nurgently needed Bonaparte's attention. The work of carrying into\r\npractice the grand educational aims of Condorcet and his coadjutors in\r\nthe French Convention was enough to tax the energies of a Hercules.\r\nThose ardent reformers did little more than clear the ground for\r\nfuture action: they abolished the old monastic and clerical training,\r\nand declared for a generous system of national education in primary,\r\nsecondary, and advanced schools. But amid strifes and bankruptcy their\r\naims remained unfulfilled. In 1799 there were only twenty-four\r\nelementary schools open in Paris, with a total attendance of less than\r\n1,000 pupils; and in rural districts matters were equally bad. Indeed,\r\nLucien Bonaparte asserted that scarcely any education was to be found\r\nin France. Exaggerated though this statement was, in relation to\r\nsecondary and advanced education, it was proximately true of the\r\nelementary schools. The revolutionists had merely traced the outlines\r\nof a scheme: it remained for the First Consul to fill in the details,\r\nor to leave it blank.\r\n\r\nThe result can scarcely be cited as a proof of his educational zeal.\r\nElementary schools were left to the control and supervision of the\r\ncommunes and of the _sous-préfets_, and naturally made little advance\r\namidst an apathetic population and under officials who cared not to\r\npress on an expensive enterprise. The law of April 30th, 1802,\r\nhowever, aimed at improving the secondary education, which the\r\nConvention had attempted to give in its _écoles centrales_. These were\r\nnow reconstituted either as _écoles secondaires_ or as _lycées_. The\r\nformer were local or even private institutions intended for the most\r\npromising pupils of the commune or group of communes; while the\r\n_lycées_, far fewer in number, were controlled directly by the\r\nGovernment. In both of these schools great prominence was given to the\r\nexact and applied sciences. The aim of the instruction was not to\r\nawaken thought and develop the faculties, but rather to fashion able\r\nbreadwinners, obedient citizens, and enthusiastic soldiers. The\r\ntraining was of an almost military type, the pupils being regularly\r\ndrilled, while the lessons began and ended with the roll of drums. The\r\nnumbers of the _lycées_ and of their pupils rapidly increased; but the\r\nprogress of the secondary and primary schools, which could boast no\r\nsuch attractions, was very slow. In 1806 only 25,000 children were\r\nattending the public primary schools. But two years later elementary\r\nand advanced instruction received a notable impetus from the\r\nestablishment of the University of France.\r\n\r\nThere is no institution which better reveals the character of the\r\nFrench Emperor, with its singular combination of greatness and\r\nlittleness, of wide-sweeping aims with official pedantry. The\r\nUniversity, as it existed during the First Empire, offers a striking\r\nexample of that mania for the control of the general will which\r\nphilosophers had so attractively taught and Napoleon so profitably\r\npractised. It is the first definite outcome of a desire to subject\r\neducation and learning to wholesale regimental methods, and to break\r\nup the old-world bowers of culture by State-worked steam-ploughs. His\r\naims were thus set forth:\r\n\r\n     \"I want a teaching body, because such a body never dies, but\r\n     transmits its organization and spirit. I want a body whose teaching\r\n     is far above the fads of the moment, goes straight on even when the\r\n     government is asleep, and whose administration and statutes become\r\n     so national that one can never lightly resolve to meddle with\r\n     them.... There will never be fixity in politics if there is not a\r\n     teaching body with fixed principles. As long as people do not from\r\n     their infancy learn whether they ought to be republicans or\r\n     monarchists, Catholics or sceptics, the State will never form a\r\n     nation: it will rest on unsafe and shifting foundations, always\r\n     exposed to changes and disorders.\"\r\n\r\nSuch being Napoleon's designs, the new University of France was\r\nadmirably suited to his purpose. It was not a local university: it was\r\nthe sum total of all the public teaching bodies of the French Empire,\r\narranged and drilled in one vast instructional array. Elementary\r\nschools, secondary schools, _lycées_, as well as the more advanced\r\ncolleges, all were absorbed in and controlled by this great teaching\r\ncorporation, which was to inculcate the precepts of the Catholic\r\nreligion, fidelity to the Emperor and to his Government, as guarantees\r\nfor the welfare of the people and the unity of France. For educational\r\npurposes, France was now divided into seventeen Academies, which\r\nformed the local centres of the new institution. Thus, from Paris and\r\nsixteen provincial Academies, instruction was strictly organized and\r\ncontrolled; and within a short time of its institution (March, 1808),\r\ninstruction of all kinds, including that of the elementary schools,\r\nshowed some advance. But to all those who look on the unfolding of the\r\nmental and moral faculties as the chief aim of true _education_, the\r\nhomely experiments of Pestalozzi offer a far more suggestive and\r\nimportant field for observation than the barrack-like methods of the\r\nFrench Emperor. The Swiss reformer sought to train the mind to\r\nobserve, reflect, and think; to assist the faculties in attaining\r\ntheir fullest and freest expression; and thus to add to the richness\r\nand variety of human thought. The French imperial system sought to\r\nprune away all mental independence, and to train the young generation\r\nin neat and serviceable _espalier_ methods: all aspiring shoots,\r\nespecially in the sphere of moral and political science, were sharply\r\ncut down. Consequently French thought, which had been the most\r\nardently speculative in Europe, speedily became vapid and mechanical.\r\n\r\nThe same remark is proximately true of the literary life of the First\r\nEmpire. It soon began to feel the rigorous methods of the Emperor.\r\nPoetry and all other modes of expression of lofty thought and rapt\r\nfeeling require not only a free outlet but natural and unrestrained\r\nsurroundings. The true poet is at home in the forest or on the\r\nmountain rather than in prim _parterres_. The philosopher sees most\r\nclearly and reasons most suggestively, when his faculties are not\r\ncramped by the need of observing political rules and police\r\nregulations. And the historian, when he is tied down to a mere\r\ninvestigation and recital of facts, without reference to their\r\nmeaning, is but a sorry fowl flapping helplessly with unequal wings.\r\n\r\nYet such were the conditions under which the literature of France\r\nstruggled and pined. Her poets, a band sadly thinned already by the\r\nguillotine, sang in forced and hollow strains until the return of\r\nroyalism begat an imperialist fervour in the soul-stirring lyrics of\r\nBéranger: her philosophy was dumb; and Napoleonic history limped along\r\non official crutches, until Thiers, a generation later, essayed his\r\nmonumental work. In the realm of exact and applied science, as might\r\nbe expected, splendid discoveries adorned the Emperor's reign; but if\r\nwe are to find any vitality in the literature of that period, we must\r\ngo to the ranks, not of the panegyrists, but of the opposition. There,\r\nin the pages of Madame de Staël and Chateaubriand, we feel the throb\r\nof life. Genius will out, of its own native force: but it cannot be\r\npressed out, even at a Napoleon's bidding. In vain did he endeavour to\r\nstimulate literature by the reorganization of the Institute, and by\r\ngranting decennial prizes for the chief works and discoveries of the\r\ndecade. While science prospered, literature languished: and one of his\r\nown remarks, as to the desirability of a public and semi-official\r\ncriticism of some great literary work, seems to suggest a reason for\r\nthis intellectual malaise:\r\n\r\n     \"The public will take interest in this criticism; perhaps it will\r\n     even take sides: it matters not, as its attention will be fixed on\r\n     these interesting debates: it will talk about grammar and poetry:\r\n     taste will be improved, and our aim will be fulfilled: _out of that\r\n     will come poets and grammarians_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it came to pass that, while he was rescuing a nation from chaos\r\nand his eagles winged their flight to Naples, Lisbon, and Moscow, he\r\nfound no original thinker worthily to hymn his praises; and the chief\r\nliterary triumphs of his reign came from Chateaubriand, whom he\r\nimpoverished, and Madame de Staël, whom he drove into exile.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch are the chief laws and customs which are imperishably associated\r\nwith the name of Napoleon Bonaparte. In some respects they may be\r\ndescribed as making for progress. Their establishment gave to the\r\nRevolution that solidity which it had previously lacked. Among so\r\n\"inflammable\" a people as the French--the epithet is Ste. Beuve's--it\r\nwas quite possible that some of the chief civil conquests of the last\r\ndecade might have been lost, had not the First Consul, to use his own\r\nexpressive phrase, \"thrown in some blocks of granite.\" We may\r\nintensify his metaphor and assert that out of the shifting shingle of\r\nFrench life he constructed a concrete breakwater, in which his own\r\nwill acted as the binding cement, defying the storms of revolutionary\r\nor royalist passion which had swept the incoherent atoms to and fro,\r\nand had carried desolation far inland. Thenceforth France was able to\r\nwork out her future under the shelter of institutions which\r\nunquestionably possess one supreme merit, that of durability. But\r\nwhile the chief civic and material gains of the Revolution were thus\r\nperpetuated, the very spirit and life of that great movement were\r\nbenumbed by the personality and action of Napoleon. The burning\r\nenthusiasm for the Rights of Man was quenched, the passion for civic\r\nequality survived only as the gibbering ghost of what it had been in\r\n1790, and the consolidation of revolutionary France was effected by a\r\nprocess nearly akin to petrifaction.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this time of political and intellectual reaction in France was\r\nmarked by the rise of the greatest of her modern institutions. There\r\nis the chief paradox of that age. While barren of literary activity\r\nand of truly civic developments, yet it was unequalled in the growth\r\nof institutions. This is generally the characteristic of epochs when\r\nthe human faculties, long congealed by untoward restraints, suddenly\r\nburst their barriers and run riot in a spring-tide of hope. The time\r\nof disillusionment or despair which usually supervenes may, as a rule,\r\nbe compared with the numbing torpor of winter, necessary doubtless in\r\nour human economy, but lacking the charm and vitality of the expansive\r\nphase. Often, indeed, it is disgraced by the characteristics of a\r\nslavish populace, a mean selfishness, a mad frivolity, and fawning\r\nadulation on the ruler who dispenses _panem et circenses_. Such has\r\nbeen the course of many a political reaction, from the time of\r\ndegenerate Athens and imperial Rome down to the decay of Medicean\r\nFlorence and the orgies of the restored Stuarts.\r\n\r\nThe fruitfulness of the time of monarchical reaction in France may be\r\nchiefly attributed to two causes, the one general, the other personal;\r\nthe one connected with the French Revolution, the other with the\r\nexceptional gifts of Bonaparte. In their efforts to create durable\r\ninstitutions the revolutionists had failed: they had attempted too\r\nmuch: they had overthrown the old order, had undertaken crusades\r\nagainst monarchical Europe, and striven to manufacture constitutions\r\nand remodel a deeply agitated society. They did scarcely more than\r\ntrace the outlines of the future social structure. The edifice, which\r\nshould have been reared by the Directory, was scarcely advanced at\r\nall, owing to the singular dullness of the new rulers of France. But\r\nthe genius was at hand. He restored order, he rallied various classes\r\nto his side, he methodized local government, he restored finance and\r\ncredit, he restored religious peace and yet secured the peasants in\r\ntheir tenure of the confiscated lands, he rewarded merit with social\r\nhonours, and finally he solidified his polity by a comprehensive code\r\nof laws which made him the keystone of the now rounded arch of French\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nHis methods in this immense work deserve attention: they were very\r\ndifferent from those of the revolutionary parties after the best days\r\nof 1789 were past. The followers of Rousseau worked on rigorous _a\r\npriori_ methods. If institutions and sentiments did not square with\r\nthe principles of their master, they were swept away or were forced\r\ninto conformity with the new evangel. A correct knowledge of the\r\n\"Contrat Social\" and keen critical powers were the prime requisites of\r\nJacobinical statesmanship. Knowledge of the history of France, the\r\nfaculty of gauging the real strength of popular feelings, tact in\r\nconciliating important interests, all were alike despised.\r\nInstitutions and class interests were as nothing in comparison with\r\nthat imposing abstraction, the general will. For this alone could\r\nphilosophers legislate and factions conspire.\r\n\r\nFrom these lofty aims and exasperating methods Bonaparte was speedily\r\nweaned. If victorious analysis led to this; if it could only pull\r\ndown, not reconstruct; if, while legislating for the general will,\r\nJacobins harassed one class after another and produced civil war, then\r\naway with their pedantries in favour of the practical statecraft which\r\nattempted one task at a time and aimed at winning back in turn the\r\nalienated classes. Then, and then alone, after civic peace had been\r\nre-established, would he attempt the reconstruction of the civil order\r\nin the same tentative manner, taking up only this or that frayed end\r\nat once, trusting to time, skill, and patience to transform the tangle\r\ninto a symmetrical pattern. And thus, where Feuillants, Girondins, and\r\nJacobins had produced chaos, the practical man and his able helpers\r\nsucceeded in weaving ineffaceable outlines. As to the time when the\r\nchange took place in Bonaparte's brain from Jacobinism to aims and\r\nmethods that may be called conservative, we are strangely ignorant.\r\nBut the results of this mental change will stand forth clear and\r\nsolid for many a generation in the customs, laws, and institutions of\r\nhis adopted country. If the Revolution, intellectually considered,\r\nbegan and ended with analysis, Napoleon's faculties supplied the\r\nneeded synthesis. Together they made modern France.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE CONSULATE FOR LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the view of presenting in clear outlines the chief institutions\r\nof Napoleonic France, they have been described in the preceding\r\nchapter, detached from their political setting. We now return to\r\nconsider the events which favoured the consolidation of Bonaparte's\r\npower.\r\n\r\nNo politician inured to the tricks of statecraft could more firmly\r\nhave handled public affairs than the man who practically began his\r\npolitical apprenticeship at Brumaire. Without apparent effort he rose\r\nto the height whence the five Directors had so ignominiously fallen;\r\nand instinctively he chose at once the policy which alone could have\r\ninsured rest for France, that of balancing interests and parties. His\r\nown political views being as yet unknown, dark with the excessive\r\nbrightness of his encircling glory, he could pose as the conciliator\r\nof contending factions. The Jacobins were content when they saw the\r\nregicide Cambacérès become Second Consul; and friends of\r\nconstitutional monarchy remembered that the Third Consul, Lebrun, had\r\nleanings towards the Feuillants of 1791. Fouché at the inquisitorial\r\nMinistry of Police, and Merlin, Berlier, Real, and Boulay de la\r\nMeurthe in the Council of State seemed a barrier to all monarchical\r\nschemes; and the Jacobins therefore remained quiet, even while\r\nCatholic worship was again publicly celebrated, while Vendean rebels\r\nwere pardoned, and plotting _émigrés_ were entering the public\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nMany, indeed, of the prominent terrorists had settled profitably on\r\nthe offices which Bonaparte had multiplied throughout France, and were\r\ntherefore dumb: but some of the less favoured ones, angered by the\r\nstealthy advance of autocracy, wove a plot for the overthrow of the\r\nFirst Consul. Chief among them were a braggart named Demerville, a\r\npainter, Topino Lebrun, a sculptor, Ceracchi, and Aréna, brother of\r\nthe Corsican deputy who had shaken Bonaparte by the collar at the\r\ncrisis of Brumaire. These men hit upon the notion that, with the aid\r\nof one man of action, they could make away with the new despot. They\r\nopened their hearts to a penniless officer named Harel, who had been\r\ndismissed from the army; and he straightway took the news to\r\nBonaparte's private secretary, Bourrienne. The First Consul, on\r\nhearing of the matter, at once charged Bourrienne to supply Harel with\r\nmoney to buy firearms, but not to tell the secret to Fouché, of whose\r\ndouble dealings with the Jacobins he was already aware. It became\r\nneedful, however, to inform him of the plot, which was now carefully\r\nnursed by the authorities. The arrests were planned to take place at\r\nthe opera on October 10th. About half an hour after the play had\r\nbegun, Bonaparte bade his secretary go into the lobby to hear the\r\nnews. Bourrienne at once heard the noise caused by a number of\r\narrests: he came back, reported the matter to his master, who\r\nforthwith returned to the Tuileries. The plot was over.[168]\r\n\r\nA more serious attempt was to follow. On the 3rd day of Nivôse\r\n(December 24th, 1800), as the First Consul was driving to the opera to\r\nhear Haydn's oratorio, \"The Creation,\" his carriage was shaken by a\r\nterrific explosion. A bomb had burst between his carriage and that of\r\nJosephine, which was following. Neither was injured, though many\r\nspectators were killed or wounded. \"Josephine,\" he calmly said, as she\r\nentered the box, \"those rascals wanted to blow me up: send for a copy\r\nof the music.\" But under this cool demeanour he nursed a determination\r\nof vengeance against his political foes, the Jacobins. On the next day\r\nhe appeared at a session of the Council of State along with the\r\nMinisters of Police and of the Interior, Fouché and Chaptal. The Aréna\r\nplot and other recent events seemed to point to wild Jacobins and\r\nanarchists as the authors of this outrage: but Fouché ventured to\r\nimpute it to the royalists and to England.\r\n\r\n     \"There are in it,\" Bonaparte at once remarked, \"neither nobles, nor\r\n     Chouans, nor priests. They are men of September (_Septembriseurs_),\r\n     wretches stained with blood, ever conspiring in solid phalanx\r\n     against every successive government. We must find a means of prompt\r\n     redress.\"\r\n\r\nThe Councillors at once adopted this opinion, Roederer hotly declaring\r\nhis open hostility to Fouché for his reputed complicity with the\r\nterrorists; and, if we may credit the _on dit_ of Pasquier, Talleyrand\r\nurged the execution of Fouché within twenty-four hours. Bonaparte,\r\nhowever, preferred to keep the two cleverest and most questionable\r\nschemers of the age, so as mutually to check each other's movements. A\r\nday later, when the Council was about to institute special\r\nproceedings, Bonaparte again intervened with the remark that the\r\naction of the tribunal would be too slow, too restricted: a signal\r\nrevenge was needed for so foul a crime, rapid as lightning:\r\n\r\n     \"Blood must be shed: as many guilty must be shot as the innocent\r\n     who had perished--some fifteen or twenty--and two hundred banished,\r\n     so that the Republic might profit by that event to purge itself.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the policy now openly followed. In vain did some members of\r\nthe usually obsequious Council object to this summary procedure.\r\nRoederer, Boulay, even the Second Consul himself, now perceived how\r\ntrifling was their influence when they attempted to modify Bonaparte's\r\nplans, and two sections of the Council speedily decided that there\r\nshould be a military commission to judge suspects and \"deport\"\r\ndangerous persons, and that the Government should announce this to\r\nthe Senate, Corps Législatif, and Tribunate. Public opinion,\r\nmeanwhile, was carefully trained by the official \"Moniteur,\" which\r\ndescribed in detail various so-called anarchist attempts; but an\r\nincreasing number in official circles veered round to Fouché's belief\r\nthat the outrage was the work of the royalists abetted by England. The\r\nFirst Consul himself, six days after the event, inclined to this\r\nversion. Nevertheless, at a full meeting of the Council of State, on\r\nthe first day of the year 1801, he brought up a list of \"130 villains\r\nwho were troubling the public peace,\" with a view to inflicting\r\nsummary punishment on them. Thibaudeau, Boulay, and Roederer haltingly\r\nexpressed their fears that all the 130 might not be guilty of the\r\nrecent outrage, and that the Council had no powers to decide on the\r\nproscription of individuals. Bonaparte at once assured them that he\r\nwas not consulting them about the fate of individuals, but merely to\r\nknow whether they thought an exceptional measure necessary. The\r\nGovernment had only\r\n\r\n     \"Strong presumptions, not proofs, that the terrorists were the\r\n     authors of this attempt. _Chouannerie_ and emigration are surface\r\n     ills, terrorism is an internal disease. The measure ought to be\r\n     taken independently of the event. It is only the occasion of it. We\r\n     banish them (the terrorists) for the massacres of September 2nd,\r\n     May 31st, the Babeuf plot, and every subsequent attempt.\"[169]\r\n\r\nThe Council thereupon unanimously affirmed the need of an exceptional\r\nmeasure, and adopted a suggestion of Talleyrand (probably emanating\r\nfrom Bonaparte) that the Senate should be invited to declare by a\r\nspecial decision, called a _senatus consultum_, whether such an act\r\nwere \"preservative of the constitution.\" This device, which avoided\r\nthe necessity of passing a law through two less subservient bodies,\r\nthe Tribunate and Corps Législatif, was forthwith approved by the\r\nguardians of the constitution. It had far-reaching results. The\r\ncomplaisant Senate was brought down from its constitutional watchtower\r\nto become the tool of the Consuls; and an easy way for further\r\ninnovations was thus dextrously opened up through the very portals\r\nwhich were designed to bar them out.\r\n\r\nThe immediate results of the device were startling. By an act of\r\nJanuary 4th, 1801, as many as 130 prominent Jacobins were \"placed\r\nunder special surveillance outside the European territory of the\r\nRepublic\"--a specious phrase for denoting a living death amidst the\r\nwastes of French Guiana or the Seychelles. Some of the threatened\r\npersons escaped, perhaps owing to the connivance of Fouché; some were\r\nsent to the Isle of Oléron; but the others were forthwith despatched\r\nto the miseries of captivity in the tropics. Among these were\r\npersonages so diverse as Rossignol, once the scourge of France with\r\nhis force of Parisian cut-throats, and Destrem, whose crime was his\r\nvehement upbraiding of Bonaparte at St. Cloud. After this measure had\r\ntaken effect, it was discovered by judicial inquiry that the Jacobins\r\nhad no connection with the outrage, which was the work of royalists\r\nnamed Saint-Réjant and Carbon. These were captured, and on January\r\n31st, 1801, were executed; but their fate had no influence whatever on\r\nthe sentence of the transported Jacobins. Of those who were sent to\r\nGuiana and the Seychelles, scarce twenty saw France again.[170]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBonaparte's conduct with respect to plots deserves close attention.\r\nNever since the age of the Borgias have conspiracies been so skilfully\r\nexploited, so cunningly countermined. Moreover, his conduct with\r\nrespect to the Aréna and Nivôse affairs had a wider significance; for\r\nhe now quietly but firmly exchanged the policy of balancing parties\r\nfor one which crushed the extreme republicans, and enhanced the\r\nimportance of all who were likely to approve or condone the\r\nestablishment of personal rule.\r\n\r\nIt is now time to consider the effect which Bonaparte's foreign policy\r\nhad on his position in France. Reserving for a later chapter an\r\nexamination of the Treaty of Amiens, we may here notice the close\r\nconnection between Bonaparte's diplomatic successes and the\r\nperpetuation of his Consulate. All thoughtful students of history must\r\nhave observed the warping influence which war and diplomacy have\r\nexerted on democratic institutions. The age of Alcibiades, the doom of\r\nthe Roman Republic, and many other examples might be cited to show\r\nthat free institutions can with difficulty survive the strain of a\r\nvast military organization or the insidious results of an exacting\r\ndiplomacy. But never has the gulf between democracy and personal rule\r\nbeen so quickly spanned as by the commanding genius of Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nThe events which disgusted both England and France with war have been\r\ndescribed above. Each antagonist had parried the attacks of the other.\r\nThe blow which Bonaparte had aimed at Britain's commerce by his\r\neastern expedition had been foiled; and a considerable French force\r\nwas shut up in Egypt. His plan of relieving his starving garrison in\r\nMalta, by concluding a maritime truce, had been seen through by us;\r\nand after a blockade of two years, Valetta fell (September, 1800). But\r\nwhile Great Britain regained more than all her old power in the\r\nMediterranean, she failed to make any impression on the land-power of\r\nFrance. The First Consul in the year 1801 compelled Naples and\r\nPortugal to give up the English alliance and to exclude our vessels\r\nand goods. In the north the results of the war had been in favour of\r\nthe islanders. The Union Jack again waved triumphant on the Baltic,\r\nand all attempts of the French to rouse and support an Irish revolt\r\nhad signally failed. Yet the French preparations for an invasion of\r\nEngland strained the resources of our exchequer and the patience of\r\nour people. The weary struggle was evidently about to close in a\r\nstalemate.\r\n\r\nFor political and financial reasons the two Powers needed repose.\r\nBonaparte's authority was not as yet so firmly founded that he could\r\nafford to neglect the silent longings of France for peace; his\r\ninstitutions had not as yet taken root; and he needed money for public\r\nworks and colonial enterprises. That he looked on peace as far more\r\ndesirable for France than for England at the present time is clear\r\nfrom a confidential talk which he had with Roederer at the close of\r\n1800. This bright thinker, to whom he often unbosomed himself, took\r\nexception to his remark that England could not wish for peace;\r\nwhereupon the First Consul uttered these memorable words:\r\n\r\n     \"My dear fellow, England ought not to wish for peace, because we\r\n     are masters of the world. Spain is ours. We have a foothold in\r\n     Italy. In Egypt we have the reversion to their tenure. Switzerland,\r\n     Holland, Belgium--that is a matter irrevocably settled, on which we\r\n     have declared to Prussia, Russia, and the Emperor that _we alone_,\r\n     if it were necessary, would make war on all, namely, that there\r\n     shall be no Stadholder in Holland, and that we will keep Belgium\r\n     and the left bank of the Rhine. A stadholder in Holland would be as\r\n     bad as a Bourbon in the St. Antoine suburb.\"[171]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe passage is remarkable, not only for its frank statement of the\r\nterms on which England and the Continent might have peace, but also\r\nbecause it discloses the rank undergrowth of pride and ambition that\r\nis beginning to overtop his reasoning faculties. Even before he has\r\nheard the news of Moreau's great victory of Hohenlinden, he equates\r\nthe military strength of France with that of the rest of Europe: nay,\r\nhe claims without a shadow of doubt the mastery of the world: he will\r\nwage, if necessary, a double war, against England for a colonial\r\nempire, and against Europe for domination in Holland and the\r\nRhineland. It is naught to him that that double effort has exhausted\r\nFrance in the reigns of Louis XIV. and Louis XV. Holland, Switzerland,\r\nItaly, shall be French provinces, Egypt and the Indies shall be her\r\nsatrapies, and _la grande nation_ may then rest on her glories.\r\n\r\nHad these aims been known at Westminster, Ministers would have counted\r\npeace far more harmful than war. But, while ambition reigned at Paris,\r\ndull common sense dictated the policy of Britain. In truth, our people\r\nneeded rest: we were in the first stages of an industrial revolution:\r\nour cotton and woollen industries were passing from the cottage to the\r\nfactory; and a large part of our folk were beginning to cluster in\r\ngrimy, ill-organized townships. Population and wealth advanced by\r\nleaps and bounds; but with them came the nineteenth-century problems\r\nof widening class distinctions and uncertainty of employment. The\r\nfood-supply was often inadequate, and in 1801 the price of wheat in\r\nthe London market ranged from £6 to £8 the quarter; the quartern loaf\r\nselling at times for as much as 1s. 10-1/2d.[172]\r\n\r\nThe state of the sister island was even worse. The discontent of\r\nIreland had been crushed by the severe repression which followed the\r\nrising of 1798; and the bonds connecting the two countries were\r\nforcibly tightened by the Act of Union of 1800. But rest and reform\r\nwere urgently needed if this political welding was to acquire solid\r\nstrength, and rest and reform were alike denied. The position of the\r\nMinistry at Westminster was also precarious. The opposition of George\r\nIII. to the proposals for Catholic Emancipation, to which Pitt\r\nbelieved himself in honour bound, led to the resignation in February,\r\n1801, of that able Minister. In the following month Addington, the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Commons, with the complacence born of bland\r\nobtuseness, undertook to fill his place. At first, the Ministry was\r\ntreated with the tolerance due to the new Premier's urbanity, but it\r\ngradually faded away into contempt for his pitiful weakness in face of\r\nthe dangers that threatened the realm.\r\n\r\nCertain unofficial efforts in the cause of peace had been made during\r\nthe year 1800, by a Frenchman, M. Otto, who had been charged to\r\nproceed to London to treat with the British Government for the\r\nexchange of prisoners. For various reasons his tentative proposals as\r\nto an accommodation between the belligerents had had no issue: but he\r\ncontinued to reside in London, and quietly sought to bring about a\r\ngood understanding. The accession of the Addington Ministry favoured\r\nthe opening of negotiations, the new Secretary for Foreign Affairs,\r\nLord Hawkesbury, announcing His Majesty's desire for peace. Indeed,\r\nthe one hope of the new Ministry, and of the king who supported it as\r\nthe only alternative to Catholic Emancipation, was bound up with the\r\ncause of peace. In the next chapter it will appear how disastrous were\r\nthe results of that strange political situation, when a morbidly\r\nconscientious king clung to the weak Addington, and jeopardised the\r\ninterests of Britain, rather than accept a strong Minister and a\r\nmeasure of religious equality.\r\n\r\nNapoleon received Hawkesbury's first overtures, those of March 21st,\r\n1801, with thinly veiled scorn; but the news of Nelson's victory at\r\nCopenhagen and of the assassination of the Czar Paul, the latter of\r\nwhich wrung from him a cry of rage, ended his hopes of crushing us;\r\nand negotiations were now formally begun. On the 14th of April, Great\r\nBritain demanded that the French should evacuate Egypt, while she\r\nherself would give up Minorca, but retain the following conquests:\r\nMalta, Tobago, Martinique, Trinidad, Essequibo, Demerara, Berbice,\r\nCeylon, and (a little later) Curaçoa; while, if the Cape of Good Hope\r\nwere restored to the Dutch, it was to be a free port: an indemnity was\r\nalso to be found for the Prince of Orange for the loss of his\r\nNetherlands. These claims were declared by Bonaparte to be\r\ninadmissible. He on his side urged the far more impracticable demand\r\nof the _status quo ante bellum_ in the East and West Indies and in the\r\nMediterranean; which would imply the surrender, not only of our many\r\nnaval conquests, but also of our gains in Hindostan at the expense of\r\nthe late Tippoo Sahib's dominions. In the ensuing five months the\r\nBritish Government gained some noteworthy successes in diplomacy and\r\nwar. It settled the disputes arising out of the Armed Neutrality\r\nLeague; there was every prospect of our troops defeating those of\r\nFrance in Egypt; and our navy captured St. Eustace and Saba in the\r\nWest Indies.\r\n\r\nAs a set-off to our efforts by sea, Bonaparte instigated a war between\r\nSpain and Portugal, in order that the latter Power might be held as a\r\n\"guarantee for the general peace.\" Spain, however, merely waged a \"war\r\nof oranges,\" and came to terms with her neighbour in the Treaty of\r\nBadajoz, June 6th, 1801, whereby she gained the small frontier\r\ndistrict of Olivenza. This fell far short of the First Consul's\r\nintentions. Indeed, such was his annoyance at the conduct of the Court\r\nof Madrid and the complaisance of his brother Lucien Bonaparte, who\r\nwas ambassador there, that he determined to make Spain bear a heavy\r\nshare of the English demands. On June 22nd, 1801, he wrote to his\r\nbrother at Madrid:\r\n\r\n     \"I have already caused the English to be informed that I will never\r\n     depart, as regards Portugal, from the _ultimatum_ addressed to M.\r\n     d'Araujo, and that the _status quo ante bellum_ for Portugal must\r\n     amount, for Spain, to the restitution of Trinidad; for France, to\r\n     the restitution of Martinique and Tobago; and for Batavia [Holland],\r\n     to that of Curaçoa and some other small American isles.\"[173]\r\n\r\nIn other words, if Portugal at the close of this whipped-up war\r\nretained her present possessions, then England must renounce her\r\nclaims to Trinidad, Martinique, Tobago, Curaçoa, etc.: and he summed\r\nup his contention in the statement that \"in signing this treaty\r\nCharles IV. has consented to the loss of Trinidad.\" Further pressure\r\non Portugal compelled her to cede part of Northern Brazil to France\r\nand to pay her 20,000,000 francs.\r\n\r\nA still more striking light is thrown on Bonaparte's diplomatic\r\nmethods by the following question, addressed to Lord Hawkesbury on\r\nJune 15th:\r\n\r\n     \"If, supposing that the French Government should accede to the\r\n     arrangements proposed for the East Indies by England, and should\r\n     adopt the _status quo ante bellum_ for Portugal, the King of\r\n     England would consent to the re-establishment of the _status quo_\r\n     in the Mediterranean and in America.\"\r\n\r\nThe British Minister in his reply of June 25th explained what the\r\nphrase _status quo ante bellum_ in regard to the Mediterranean would\r\nreally imply. It would necessitate, not merely the evacuation of Egypt\r\nby the French, but also that of the Kingdom of Sardinia (including\r\nNice), the Duchy of Tuscany, and the independence of the rest of the\r\npeninsula. He had already offered that we should evacuate Minorca; but\r\nhe now stated that, if France retained her influence over Italy,\r\nEngland would claim Malta as a set-off to the vast extension of French\r\nterritorial influence, and in order to protect English commerce in\r\nthose seas: for the rest, the British Government could not regard the\r\nmaintenance of the integrity of Portugal as an equivalent to the\r\nsurrender by Great Britain of her West Indian conquests, especially as\r\nFrance had acquired further portions of Saint Domingo. Nevertheless he\r\noffered to restore Trinidad to Spain, if she would reinstate Portugal\r\nin the frontier strip of Olivenza; and, on August 5th, he told Otto\r\nthat we would give up Malta if it became independent.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile events were, on the whole, favourable to Great Britain. She\r\nmade peace with Russia on favourable terms; and in the Mediterranean,\r\ndespite a first success gained by the French Admiral Linois at\r\nAlgesiras, a second battle brought back victory to the Union Jack. An\r\nattack made by Nelson on the flotilla at Boulogne was a failure\r\n(August 15th). But at the close of August the French commander in\r\nEgypt, General Menou, was constrained to agree to the evacuation of\r\nEgypt by his troops, which were to be sent back to France on English\r\nvessels. This event had been expected by Bonaparte, and the secret\r\ninstruction which he forwarded to Otto at London shows the nicety of\r\nhis calculation as to the advantages to be reaped by France owing to\r\nher receiving the news while it was still unknown in England. He\r\nordered Otto to fix October the 2nd for the close of the negotiations:\r\n\r\n     \"You will understand the importance of this when you reflect that\r\n     Menou may possibly not be able to hold out in Alexandria beyond the\r\n     first of Vendémiaire (September 22nd); that, at this season, the\r\n     winds are fair to come from Egypt, and ships reach Italy and\r\n     Trieste in very few days. Thus it is necessary to push them [the\r\n     negotiations] to a conclusion before Vendémiaire 10.\"\r\n\r\nThe advantages of an irresponsible autocrat in negotiating with a\r\nMinistry dependent on Parliament have rarely been more signally shown.\r\nAnxious to gain popularity, and unable to stem the popular movement\r\nfor peace, Addington and Hawkesbury yielded to this request for a\r\nfixed limit of time; and the preliminaries of peace were signed at\r\nLondon on October 1st, 1801, the very day before the news arrived\r\nthere that one of our demands was rendered useless by the actual\r\nsurrender of the French in Egypt.[174]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief conditions of the preliminaries were as follows: Great\r\nBritain restored to France, Spain, and the Batavian Republic all their\r\npossessions and colonies recently conquered by her except Trinidad and\r\nCeylon. The Cape of Good Hope was given back to the Dutch, but\r\nremained open to British and French commerce. Malta was to be restored\r\nto the Order of St. John, and placed under the guarantee and\r\nprotection of a third Power to be agreed on in the definitive treaty.\r\nEgypt returned to the control of the Sublime Porte. The existing\r\npossessions of Portugal (that is, exclusive of Olivenza) were\r\npreserved intact. The French agreed to loose their hold on the Kingdom\r\nof Naples and the Roman territory; while the British were also to\r\nevacuate Porto Ferrajo (Elba) and the other ports and islands which\r\nthey held in the Mediterranean and Adriatic. The young Republic of the\r\nSeven Islands (Ionian Islands) was recognized by France: and the\r\nfisheries on the coasts of Newfoundland and the adjacent isles were\r\nplaced on their former footing, subject to \"such arrangements as shall\r\nappear just and reciprocally useful.\"\r\n\r\nIt was remarked as significant of the new docility of George III.,\r\nthat the empty title of \"King of France,\" which he and his\r\npredecessors had affected, was now formally resigned, and the _fleurs\r\nde lys_ ceased to appear on the royal arms.\r\n\r\nThus, with three exceptions, Great Britain had given way on every\r\npoint of importance since the first declaration of her claims; the\r\nthree exceptions were Trinidad and Ceylon, which she gained from the\r\nallies of France; and Egypt, the recovery of which from the French was\r\nalready achieved, though it was unknown at London. On every detail but\r\nthese Bonaparte had gained a signal diplomatic success. His skill and\r\ntenacity bade fair to recover for France, Martinique, Tobago, and\r\nSanta Lucia, then in British hands, as well as the French stations in\r\nIndia. The only British gains, after nine years of warfare, fruitful\r\nin naval triumphs, but entailing an addition of £290,000,000 to the\r\nNational Debt, were the islands of Trinidad and the Dutch possessions\r\nin Ceylon. And yet in the six months spent in negotiations the general\r\ncourse of events had been favourable to the northern Power. What then\r\nhad been lacking? Certainly not valour to her warriors, nor good\r\nfortune to her flag; but merely brain power to her rulers. They had\r\nlittle of that foresight, skill, and intellectual courage, without\r\nwhich even the exploits of a Nelson are of little permanent effect.\r\n\r\nReserving for treatment in the next chapter the questions arising from\r\nthese preliminaries and the resulting Peace of Amiens, we turn now to\r\nconsider their bearing on Bonaparte's position as First Consul. The\r\nreturn of peace after an exhausting war is always welcome; yet the\r\npatriotic Briton who saw the National Debt more than doubled, with no\r\nadequate gain in land or influence, could not but contrast the\r\ndifference in the fortunes of France. That Power had now gained the\r\nRhine boundary; her troops garrisoned the fortresses of Holland and\r\nNorthern Italy; her chief dictated his will to German princelings and\r\nto the once free Switzers; while the Court of Madrid, nay, the\r\nEternal City herself, obeyed his behests. And all this prodigious\r\nexpansion had been accomplished at little apparent cost to France\r\nherself; for the victors' bill had been very largely met out of the\r\nresources of the conquered territories. It is true that her nobles and\r\nclergy had suffered fearful losses in lands and treasure, while her\r\ntrading classes had cruelly felt the headlong fall in value of her\r\npaper notes: but in a land endowed with a bounteous soil and climate\r\nsuch losses are soon repaired, and the signature of the peace with\r\nEngland left France comparatively prosperous. In October the First\r\nConsul also concluded peace with Russia, and came to a friendly\r\nunderstanding with the Czar on Italian affairs and the question of\r\nindemnities for the dispossessed German Princes.[175]\r\n\r\n\r\nBonaparte now strove to extend the colonies and commerce of France, a\r\ntopic to which we shall return later on, and to develop her internal\r\nresources. The chief roads were repaired, and ceased to be in the\r\nmiserable condition in which the abolition of the _corvées_ in 1789\r\nhad left them: canals were dug to connect the chief river systems of\r\nFrance, or were greatly improved; and Paris soon benefited from the\r\nconstruction of the Scheldt and Oise canal, which brought the\r\nresources of Belgium within easy reach of the centre of France. Ports\r\nwere deepened and extended; and Marseilles entered on golden vistas of\r\nprosperity soon to be closed by the renewal of war with England.\r\nCommunications with Italy were facilitated by the improvement of the\r\nroad between Marseilles and Genoa, as also of the tracks leading over\r\nthe Simplon, Mont Cenis, and Mont Genèvre passes: the roads leading to\r\nthe Rhine and along its left bank also attested the First Consul's\r\ndesire, not only to extend commerce, but to protect his natural\r\nboundary on the east. The results of this road-making were to be seen\r\nin the campaign of Ulm, when the French forces marched from Boulogne\r\nto the Black Forest at an unparalleled speed.\r\n\r\nParis in particular felt his renovating hand. With the abrupt,\r\ndetermined tones which he assumed more and more on reaching absolute\r\npower, he one day said to Chaptal at Malmaison:\r\n\r\n     \"I intend to make Paris the most beautiful capital of the world: I\r\n     wish that in ten years it should number two millions of\r\n     inhabitants.\" \"But,\" replied his Minister of the Interior, \"one\r\n     cannot improvise population; ... as it is, Paris would scarcely\r\n     support one million\"; and he instanced the want of good drinking\r\n     water. \"What are your plans for giving water to Paris?\" Chaptal\r\n     gave two alternatives--artesian wells or the bringing of water from\r\n     the River Ourcq to Paris. \"I adopt the latter plan: go home and\r\n     order five hundred men to set to work to-morrow at La Villette to\r\n     dig the canal.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the inception of a great public work which cost more than\r\nhalf a million sterling. The provisioning of Paris also received\r\ncareful attention, a large reserve of wheat being always kept on hand\r\nfor the satisfaction of \"a populace which is only dangerous when it is\r\nhungry.\" Bonaparte therefore insisted on corn being stored and sold in\r\nlarge quantities and at a very low price, even when considerable loss\r\nwas thereby entailed.[176] But besides supplying _panem_ he also\r\nprovided _circenses_ to an extent never known even in the days of\r\nLouis XV. State aid was largely granted to the chief theatres, where\r\nBonaparte himself was a frequent attendant, and a willing captive to\r\nthe charms of the actress Mlle. Georges.\r\n\r\nThe beautifying of Paris was, however, the chief means employed by\r\nBonaparte for weaning its populace from politics; and his efforts to\r\nthis end were soon crowned with complete success. Here again the\r\nevents of the Revolution had left the field clear for vast works of\r\nreconstruction such as would have been impossible but for the\r\nabolition of the many monastic institutions of old Paris. On or near\r\nthe sites of the famous Feuillants and Jacobins he now laid down\r\nsplendid thoroughfares; and where the constitutionals or reds a decade\r\npreviously had perorated and fought, the fashionable world of Paris\r\nnow rolled in gilded cabriolets along streets whose names recalled the\r\nItalian and Egyptian triumphs of the First Consul. Art and culture\r\nbowed down to the ruler who ordered the renovation of the Louvre,\r\nwhich now became the treasure-house of painting and sculpture,\r\nenriched by masterpieces taken from many an Italian gallery. No\r\nenterprise has more conspicuously helped to assure the position of\r\nParis as the capital of the world's culture than Bonaparte's grouping\r\nof the nation's art treasures in a central and magnificent building.\r\nIn the first year of his Empire Napoleon gave orders for the\r\nconstruction of vast galleries which were to connect the northern\r\npavilion of the Tuileries with the Louvre and form a splendid façade\r\nto the new Rue de Rivoli. Despite the expense, the work was pushed\r\non until it was suddenly arrested by the downfall of the Empire,\r\nand was left to the great man's nephew to complete. Though it is\r\npossible, as Chaptal avers, that the original design aimed at the\r\nformation of a central fortress, yet to all lovers of art, above\r\nall to the hero-worshipping Heine, the new Louvre was a sure pledge\r\nof Napoleon's immortality.\r\n\r\nOther works which combined beauty with utility were the prolongation\r\nof the quays along the left bank of the Seine, the building of three\r\nbridges over that river, the improvement of the Jardin des Plantes,\r\ntogether with that of other parks and open spaces, and the completion\r\nof the Conservatoire of Arts and Trades. At a later date, the military\r\nspirit of the Empire received signal illustration in the erection of\r\nthe Vendôme column, the Arc de Triomphe, and the consecration, or\r\ndesecration, of the Madeleine as a temple of glory.\r\n\r\nMany of these works were subsequent to the period which we are\r\nconsidering; but the enterprises of the Emperor represent the designs\r\nof the First Consul; and the plans for the improvement of Paris formed\r\nduring the Consulate were sufficient to inspire the Parisians with\r\nlively gratitude and to turn them from political speculations to\r\nscenes of splendour and gaiety that recalled the days of Louis XIV. If\r\nwe may believe the testimony of Romilly, who visited Paris in 1802,\r\nthe new policy had even then attained its end.\r\n\r\n     \"The quiet despotism, which leaves everybody who does not wish to\r\n     meddle with politics (and few at present have any such wish) in the\r\n     full and secure enjoyment of their property and of their pleasures,\r\n     is a sort of paradise, compared with the agitation, the perpetual\r\n     alarms, the scenes of infamy, of bloodshed, which accompanied the\r\n     pretended liberties of France.\"\r\n\r\nBut while acknowledging the material benefits of Bonaparte's rule, the\r\nsame friend of liberty notes with concern:\r\n\r\n     \"That he [Bonaparte] meditates the gaining fresh laurels in war can\r\n     hardly be doubted, if the accounts which one hears of his restless\r\n     and impatient disposition be true.\"\r\n\r\nHowever much the populace delighted in this new _régime_, the many\r\nardent souls who had dared and achieved so much in the sacred quest of\r\nliberty could not refrain from protesting against the innovations\r\nwhich were restoring personal rule. Though the Press was gagged,\r\nthough as many as thirty-two Departments were subjected to the\r\nscrutiny of special tribunals, which, under the guise of stamping out\r\nbrigandage, frequently punished opponents of the Government, yet the\r\nvoice of criticism was not wholly silenced. The project of the\r\nConcordat was sharply opposed in the Tribunate, which also ventured to\r\ndeclare that the first sections of the Civil Codes were not\r\nconformable to the principles of 1789 and to the first draft of a code\r\npresented to the Convention. The Government thereupon refused to send\r\nto the Tribunate any important measures, but merely flung them a mass\r\nof petty details to discuss, as \"_bones to gnaw_\" until the time for\r\nthe renewal by lot of a fifth of its members should come round. During\r\na discussion at the Council of State, the First Consul hinted with\r\nmuch frankness at the methods which ought to be adopted to quell the\r\nfactious opposition of the Tribunate:\r\n\r\n     \"One cannot work with an institution so productive of disorder. The\r\n     constitution has created a legislative power composed of three\r\n     bodies. None of these branches has any right to organize itself:\r\n     that must be done by the law. Therefore we must make a body which\r\n     shall organize the manner of deliberations of these three branches.\r\n     The Tribunate ought to be divided into five sections. The\r\n     discussion of laws will take place secretly in each section: one\r\n     might even introduce a discussion between these sections and those\r\n     of the Council of State. Only the reporter will speak publicly.\r\n     Then things will go on reasonably.\"\r\n\r\nHaving delivered this opinion, _ex cathedra_, he departed (January\r\n7th, 1802) for Lyons, there to be invested with supreme authority in\r\nthe reconstituted Cisalpine, or as it was now termed, Italian\r\nRepublic[177]\r\n\r\n\r\nReturning at the close of the month, radiant with the lustre of this\r\nnew dignity, he was able to bend the Tribunate and the _Corps\r\nLégislatif_ to his will. The renewal of their membership by one-fifth\r\nserved as the opportunity for subjecting them to the more pliable\r\nSenate. This august body of highly-paid members holding office for\r\nlife had the right of nominating the new members; but hitherto the\r\nretiring members had been singled out by lot. Roederer, acting on a\r\nhint of the time-serving Second Consul, now proposed in the Council\r\nof State that the retiring members of those Chambers should\r\nthenceforth be appointed by the Senate, and not by lot; for the\r\nprinciple of the lot, he quaintly urged, was hostile to the right of\r\nelection which belonged to the Senate. Against such conscious\r\nsophistry all the bolts of logic were harmless. The question was left\r\nundecided, in order that the Senate might forthwith declare in favour\r\nof its own right to determine every year not only the elections to,\r\nbut the exclusions from, the Tribunate and the _Corps Législatif_. A\r\n_senatus consultant_ of March legalized this monstrous innovation,\r\nwhich led to the exclusion from the Tribunate of zealous republicans\r\nlike Benjamin Constant, Isnard, Ganilh, Daunou, and Chénier. The\r\ninfusion of the senatorial nominees served to complete the nullity of\r\nthese bodies; and the Tribunate, the lineal descendant of the terrible\r\nConvention, was gagged and bound within eight years of the stilling of\r\nDanton's mighty voice.\r\n\r\nIn days when civic zeal was the strength of the French Republic, the\r\nmere suggestion of such a violation of liberty would have cost the\r\nspeaker his life. But since the rise of Bonaparte, civic sentiments\r\nhad yielded place to the military spirit and to boundless pride in the\r\nnation's glory. Whenever republican feelings were outraged, there were\r\nsufficient distractions to dissipate any of the sombre broodings which\r\nBonaparte so heartily disliked; and an event of international\r\nimportance now came to still the voice of political criticism.\r\n\r\nThe signature of the definitive treaty of peace with Great Britain\r\n(March 25th, 1802) sufficed to drown the muttered discontent of the\r\nold republican party under the paeans of a nation's joy. The\r\njubilation was natural. While Londoners were grumbling at the\r\nsacrifices which Addington's timidity had entailed, all France rang\r\nwith praises of the diplomatic skill which could rescue several\r\nislands from England's grip and yet assure French supremacy on the\r\nContinent. The event seemed to call for some sign of the nation's\r\nthankfulness to the restorer of peace and prosperity. The hint having\r\nbeen given by the tactful Cambacérès to some of the members of the\r\nTribunate, this now docile body expressed a wish that there should be\r\na striking token of the national gratitude; and a motion to that\r\neffect was made by the Senate to the _Corps Législatif and_ to the\r\nGovernment itself.\r\n\r\nThe form which the national memorial should take was left entirely\r\nvague. Under ordinary circumstances the outcome would have been a\r\ncolumn or a statue: to a Napoleon it was monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe Senate was in much doubt as to the fit course of action. The\r\nmajority desired to extend the Consulate for a second term of ten\r\nyears, and a formal motion to that effect was made on May 7th. It was\r\nopposed by a few, some of whom demanded the prolongation for life. The\r\npresident, Tronchet, prompted by Fouché and other republicans, held\r\nthat only the question of prolonging the Consulate for another term of\r\nten years was before the Senate: and the motion was carried by sixty\r\nvotes against one: the dissentient voice was that of the Girondin\r\nLanjuinais. The report of this vote disconcerted the First Consul, but\r\nhe replied with some constraint that as the people had invested him\r\nwith the supreme magistrature, he would not feel assured of its\r\nconfidence unless the present proposal were also sanctioned by its\r\nvote: \"You judge that I owe the people another sacrifice: I will give\r\nit if the people's voice orders what your vote now authorizes.\" But\r\nbefore the mass vote of the people was taken, an important change had\r\nbeen made in the proposal itself. It was well known that Bonaparte was\r\ndissatisfied with the senatorial offer: and at a special session of\r\nthe Council of State, at which Ministers were present, the Second\r\nConsul urged that they must now decide how, when, and _on what\r\nquestion_ the people were to be consulted. The whole question recently\r\nsettled by the Senate was thus reopened in a way that illustrated the\r\nadvantage of multiplying councils and of keeping them under official\r\ntutelage. The Ministers present asserted that the people disapproved\r\nof the limitations of time imposed by the Senate; and after some\r\ndiscussion Cambacérès procured the decision that the consultation of\r\nthe people should be on the questions whether the First Consul should\r\nhold his power for life, and whether he should nominate his successor.\r\n\r\nTo the latter part of this proposal the First Consul offered a\r\nwell-judged refusal. To consult the people on the restoration of\r\nmonarchy would, as yet, have been as inopportune as it was\r\nsuperfluous. After gaining complete power, Bonaparte could be well\r\nassured as to the establishment of an hereditary claim. The former and\r\nless offensive part of the proposal was therefore submitted to the\r\npeople; and to it there could be only one issue amidst the prosperity\r\nbrought by the peace, and the surveillance exercised by the prefects\r\nand the grateful clergy now brought back by the Concordat. The\r\nConsulate for Life was voted by the enormous majority of more than\r\n3,500,000 affirmative votes against 8,374 negatives. But among these\r\ndissentients were many honoured names: among military men Carnot,\r\nDrouot, Mouton, and Bernard opposed the innovation; and Lafayette made\r\nthe public statement that he could not vote for such a magistracy\r\nunless political liberty were guaranteed. A _senatus consultum_ of\r\nAugust 1st forthwith proclaimed Napoleon Bonaparte Consul for Life and\r\nordered the erection of a Statue of Peace, holding in one hand the\r\nvictor's laurel and in the other the senatorial decree.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Napoleon--for henceforth he generally used his\r\nChristian name like other monarchs--presented to the Council of State\r\na project of an organic law, which virtually amounted to a new\r\nconstitution. The mere fact of its presentation at so early a date\r\nsuffices to prove how completely he had prepared for the recent change\r\nand how thoroughly assured he was of success. This important measure\r\nwas hurried through the Senate, and, without being submitted to the\r\nTribunate or _Corps Législatif_, still less to the people, for whose\r\nsanction he had recently affected so much concern--was declared to be\r\nthe fundamental law of the State.\r\n\r\nThe fifth constitution of revolutionary France may be thus described.\r\nIt began by altering the methods of election. In place of Sieyès'\r\nlists of notabilities, Bonaparte proposed a simpler plan. The\r\nadult citizens of each canton were thenceforth to meet, for\r\nelectoral purposes, in primary assemblies, to name two candidates\r\nfor the office of _juge de paix_ (i.e., magistrate) and town\r\ncouncillor, and to choose the members of the \"electoral colleges\"\r\nfor the _arrondissement_ and for the Department. In the latter case\r\nonly the 600 most wealthy men of the Department were eligible. An\r\nofficial or aristocratic tinge was to be imparted to these electoral\r\ncolleges by the infusion of members selected by the First Consul from\r\nthe members of the Legion of Honour. Fixity of opinion was also\r\nassured by members holding office for life; and, as they were elected\r\nin the midst of the enthusiasm aroused by the Peace of Amiens, they\r\nwere decidedly Bonapartist.\r\n\r\nThe electoral colleges had the following powers: they nominated two\r\ncandidates for each place vacant in the merely consultative councils\r\nof their respective areas, and had the equally barren honour of\r\npresenting two candidates for the Tribunate--the final act of\r\n_selection_ being decided by the executive, that is, by the First\r\nConsul. Corresponding privileges were accorded to the electoral\r\ncolleges of the Department, save that these plutocratic bodies had the\r\nright of presenting candidates for admission to the Senate. The lists\r\nof candidates for the _Corps_ _Législatif_ were to be formed by the\r\njoint action of the electoral colleges, namely, those of the\r\nDepartments and those of the _arrondissements_. But as the resulting\r\ncouncils and parliamentary bodies had only the shadow of power, the\r\nwhole apparatus was but an imposing machine for winnowing the air and\r\nthreshing chaff.\r\n\r\nThe First Consul secured few additional rights or attributes, except\r\nthe exercise of the royal prerogative of granting pardon. But, in\r\ntruth, his own powers were already so large that they were scarcely\r\nsusceptible of extension. The three Consuls held office for life, and\r\nwere _ex officio_ members of the Senate. The second and third Consuls\r\nwere nominated by the Senate on the presentation of the First Consul:\r\nthe Senate might reject two names proposed by him for either office,\r\nbut they must accept his third nominee. The First Consul might deposit\r\nin the State archives his proposal as to his successor: if the Senate\r\nrejected this proposal, the second and third Consuls made a\r\nsuggestion; and if it were rejected, one of the two whom they\r\nthereupon named must be elected by the Senate. The three legislative\r\nbodies lost practically all their powers, those of the _Corps\r\nLégislatif_ going to the Senate, those of the Council of State to an\r\nofficial Cabal formed out of it; while the Tribunate was forced to\r\n_debate secretly in five sections_, where, as Bonaparte observed,\r\n_they might jabber as they liked_.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the attributes of the Senate were signally\r\nenhanced. It was thenceforth charged, not only with the preservation\r\nof the republican constitution, but with its interpretation in\r\ndisputed points, and its completion wherever it should be found\r\nwanting. Furthermore, by means of organic _senatus consulta_ it was\r\nempowered to make constitutions for the French colonies, or to suspend\r\ntrial by jury for five years in any Department, or even to declare it\r\noutside the limits of the constitution. It now gained the right of\r\nbeing consulted in regard to the ratification of treaties, previously\r\nenjoyed by the _Corps Législatif._ Finally, it could dissolve the\r\n_Corps Législatif_ and the Tribunate. But this formidable machinery\r\nwas kept under the strict control of the chief engineer: all these\r\npowers were set in motion on the initiative of the Government; and the\r\nproposals for its laws, or _senatus consulta,_ were discussed in the\r\nCabal of the Council of State named by the First Consul. This\r\nprecaution might have been deemed superfluous by a ruler less careful\r\nabout details than Napoleon; the composition of the Senate was such as\r\nto assure its pliability; for though it continued to renew its ranks\r\nby co-optation, yet that privilege was restricted in the following\r\nway: from the lists of candidates for the Senate sent up by the\r\nelectoral colleges of the Departments, Napoleon selected three for\r\neach seat vacant; one of those three must be chosen by the Senate.\r\nMoreover, the First Consul was to be allowed directly to nominate\r\nforty members in addition to the eighty prescribed by the constitution\r\nof 1799. Thus, by direct or indirect means, the Senate soon became a\r\nstrict Napoleonic preserve, to which only the most devoted adherents\r\ncould aspire. And yet, such is the vanity of human efforts, it was\r\nthis very body which twelve years later was to vote his\r\ndeposition.[178]\r\n\r\nThe victory of action over talk, of the executive over the\r\nlegislature, of the one supremely able man over the discordant and\r\nhelpless many, was now complete. The process was startlingly swift;\r\nyet its chief stages are not difficult to trace. The orators of the\r\nfirst two National Assemblies of France, after wrecking the old royal\r\nauthority, were constrained by the pressure of events to intrust the\r\nsupervision of the executive powers to important committees, whose\r\nfunctions grew with the intensity of the national danger. Amidst the\r\nagonies of 1793, when France was menaced by the First Coalition, the\r\nCommittee of Public Safety leaped forth as the ensanguined champion of\r\ndemocracy; and, as the crisis, developed in intensity, this terrible\r\nbody and the Committee of General Security virtually governed France.\r\n\r\nAfter the repulse of the invaders and the fall of Robespierre, the\r\nreturn to ordinary methods was marked by the institution of the\r\nDirectory, when five men, chosen by the legislature, controlled the\r\nexecutive powers and the general policy of the Republic: that\r\ncompromise was forcibly ended by the stroke of Brumaire. Three Consuls\r\nthen seized the reins, and two years later a single charioteer gripped\r\nthe destinies of France. His powers were, in fact, ultimately derived\r\nfrom those of the secret committees of the terrorists. But, unlike the\r\nsupremacy of Robespierre, that of Napoleon could not be disputed; for\r\nthe general, while guarding all the material boons which the\r\nRevolution had conferred, conciliated the interests and classes\r\nwhereon the civilian had so brutally trampled. The new autocracy\r\ntherefore possessed a solid strength which that of the terrorists\r\ncould never possess. Indeed, it was more absolute than the dictatorial\r\npower that Rousseau had outlined. The philosopher had asserted that,\r\nwhile silencing the legislative power, the dictator really made it\r\nvocal, and that he could do everything but make laws. But Napoleon,\r\nafter 1802, did far more: he suppressed debates and yet drew laws from\r\nhis subservient legislature. Whether, then, we regard its practical\r\nimportance for France and Europe, or limit our view to the mental\r\nsagacity and indomitable will-power required for its accomplishment,\r\nthe triumph of Napoleon in the three years subsequent to his return\r\nfrom Egypt is the most stupendous recorded in the history of civilized\r\npeoples.\r\n\r\nThe populace consoled itself for the loss of political liberty by the\r\nsplendour of the fête which heralded the title of First Consul for\r\nLife, proclaimed on August 15th: that day was also memorable as being\r\nthe First Consul's thirty-third birthday, the festival of the\r\nAssumption, and the anniversary of the ratification of the Concordat.\r\nThe decorations and fireworks were worthy of so remarkable a\r\nconfluence of solemnities. High on one of the towers of Notre Dame\r\nglittered an enormous star, and at its centre there shone the sign of\r\nthe Zodiac which had shed its influence over his first hours of life.\r\nThe myriads of spectators who gazed at that natal emblem might well\r\nhave thought that his life's star was now at its zenith. Few could\r\nhave dared to think that it was to mount far higher into unknown\r\ndepths of space, blazing as a baleful portent to kings and peoples;\r\nstill less was there any Cassandra shriek of doom as to its final\r\nheadlong fall into the wastes of ocean. All was joy and jubilation\r\nover a career that had even now surpassed the records of antique\r\nheroism, that blended the romance of oriental prowess with the\r\nbeneficent toils of the legislator, and prospered alike in war and\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nAnd yet black care cast one shadow over that jubilant festival. There\r\nwas a void in the First Consul's life such as saddened but few of the\r\nmillions of peasants who looked up to him as their saviour. His wife\r\nhad borne him no heir: and there seemed no prospect that a child of\r\nhis own would ever succeed to his glorious heritage. Family joys, it\r\nseemed, were not for him. Suspicions and bickerings were his lot. His\r\nbrothers, in their feverish desire for the establishment of a\r\nBonapartist dynasty, ceaselessly urged that he should take means to\r\nprovide himself with a legitimate heir, in the last resort by\r\ndivorcing Josephine. With a consideration for her feelings which does\r\nhim credit, Napoleon refused to countenance such proceedings. Yet it\r\nis certain that from this time onwards he kept in view the\r\ndesirability, on political grounds, of divorcing her, and made this\r\nthe excuse for indulgence in amours against which Josephine's tears\r\nand reproaches were all in vain.\r\n\r\nThe consolidation of personal rule, the institution of the Legion of\r\nHonour, and the return of very many of the emigrant nobles under the\r\nterms of the recent amnesty, favoured the growth of luxury in the\r\ncapital and of Court etiquette at the Tuileries and St. Cloud. At\r\nthese palaces the pomp of the _ancien régime_ was laboriously copied.\r\nGeneral Duroc, stiff republican though he was, received the\r\nappointment of Governor of the Palace; under him were chamberlains and\r\nprefects of the palace, who enforced a ceremonial that struggled to be\r\nmonarchical. The gorgeous liveries and sumptuous garments of the reign\r\nof Louis XV. speedily replaced the military dress which even civilians\r\nhad worn under the warlike Republic. High boots, sabres, and\r\nregimental headgear gave way to buckled shoes, silk stockings, Court\r\nrapiers, and light hats, the last generally held under the arm.\r\nTricolour cockades were discarded, along with the revolutionary jargon\r\nwhich _thou'd_ and _citizen'd_ everyone; and men began to purge their\r\nspeech of some of the obscene terms which had haunted clubs and camps.\r\n\r\nIt was remarked, however, that the First Consul still clung to the use\r\nof the term _citizen_, and that amidst the surprising combinations of\r\ncolours that flecked his Court, he generally wore only the uniform of\r\na colonel of grenadiers or of the light infantry of the consular\r\nguard. This conduct resulted partly from his early dislike of luxury,\r\nbut partly, doubtless, from a conviction that republicans will forgive\r\nmuch in a man who, like Vespasian, discards the grandeur which his\r\nprowess has won, and shines by his very plainness. To trifling matters\r\nsuch as these Napoleon always attached great importance; for, as he\r\nsaid to Admiral Malcolm at St. Helena: \"In France trifles are great\r\nthings: reason is nothing.\"[179] Besides, genius so commanding as his\r\nlittle needed the external trappings wherewith ordinary mortals hide\r\ntheir nullity. If his attire was simple, it but set off the better the\r\nplay of his mobile features, and the rich, unfailing flow of his\r\nconversation. Perhaps no clearer and more pleasing account of his\r\nappearance and his conduct at a reception has ever been given to the\r\nworld than this sketch of the great man in one of his gentler moods by\r\nJohn Leslie Foster, who visited Paris shortly after the Peace of\r\nAmiens:\r\n\r\n     \"He is about five feet seven inches high, delicately and gracefully\r\n     made; his hair a dark brown crop, thin and lank; his complexion\r\n     smooth, pale, and sallow; his eyes gray, but very animated; his\r\n     eye-brows light brown, thin and projecting. All his features,\r\n     particularly his mouth and nose, fine, sharp, defined, and\r\n     expressive beyond description; expressive of what? Not of\r\n     anything _percé_ as the prints expressed him, still less of anything\r\n     _méchant_; nor has he anything of that eye whose bend doth awe the\r\n     world. The true expression of his countenance is a pleasing\r\n     melancholy, which, whenever he speaks, relaxes into the most\r\n     agreeable and gracious smile you can conceive. To this you must add\r\n     the appearance of deep and intense thought, but above all the\r\n     predominating expression a look of calm and tranquil resolution and\r\n     intrepidity which nothing human could discompose. His address is\r\n     the finest I have ever seen, and said by those who have travelled\r\n     to exceed not only every Prince and Potentate now in being, but\r\n     even all those whose memory has come down to us. He has more\r\n     unaffected dignity than I could conceive in man. His address is the\r\n     gentlest and most prepossessing you can conceive, which is seconded\r\n     by the greatest fund of levée conversation that I suppose any\r\n     person ever possessed. He speaks deliberately, but very fluently,\r\n     with particular emphasis, and in a rather low tone of voice. While\r\n     he speaks, his features are still more expressive than his\r\n     words.\"[180]\r\n\r\nIn contrast with this intellectual power and becoming simplicity of\r\nattire, how stupid and tawdry were the bevies of soulless women and\r\nthe dumb groups of half-tamed soldiers! How vapid also the rules of\r\netiquette and precedence which starched the men and agitated the minds\r\nof their consorts! Yet, while soaring above these rules with easy\r\ngrace, the First Consul imposed them rigidly on the crowd of eager\r\ncourtiers. On these burning questions he generally took the advice of\r\nM. de Rémusat, whose tact and acquaintance with Court customs were now\r\nof much service; while the sprightly wit of his young wife attracted\r\nJosephine, as it has all readers of her piquant but rather spiteful\r\nmemoirs. In her pages we catch a glimpse of the life of that singular\r\nCourt; the attempts at aping the inimitable manners of the _ancien\r\nrégime_; the pompous nullity of the second and third Consuls; the\r\ntawdry magnificence of the costumes; the studied avoidance of any word\r\nthat implied even a modicum of learning or a distant acquaintance with\r\npolitics; the nervous preoccupation about Napoleon's moods and whims;\r\nthe graceful manners of Josephine that rarely failed to charm away his\r\nhumours, except when she herself had been outrageously slighted for\r\nsome passing favourite; above all, the leaden dullness of\r\nconversation, which drew from Chaptal the confession that life there\r\nwas the life of a galley slave. And if we seek for the hidden reason\r\nwhy a ruler eminently endowed with mental force and freshness should\r\nhave endured so laboured a masquerade, we find it in his strikingly\r\nfrank confession to Madame de Rémusat: _It is fortunate that the\r\nFrench are to be ruled through their vanity._ <\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE PEACE OF AMIENS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe previous chapter dealt in the main with the internal affairs of\r\nFrance and the completion of Napoleon's power: it touched on foreign\r\naffairs only so far as to exhibit the close connection between the\r\nFirst Consul's diplomatic victory over England and his triumph over\r\nthe republican constitution in his adopted country. But it is time now\r\nto review the course of the negotiations which led up to the Treaty of\r\nAmiens.\r\n\r\nIn order to realize the advantages which France then had over England,\r\nit will be well briefly to review the condition of our land at that\r\ntime. Our population was far smaller than that of the French Republic.\r\nFrance, with her recent acquisitions in Belgium, the Rhineland, Savoy,\r\nNice, and Piedmont, numbered nearly 40,000,000 inhabitants: but the\r\ncensus returns of Great Britain for 1801 showed only a total of\r\n10,942,000 souls, while the numbers for Ireland, arguing from the\r\nrather untrustworthy return of 1813, may be reckoned at about six and\r\na half millions. The prodigious growth of the English-speaking people\r\nhad not as yet fully commenced either in the motherland, the United\r\nStates, or in the small and struggling settlements of Canada and\r\nAustralia. Its future expansion was to be assured by industrial and\r\nsocial causes, and by the events considered in this and in subsequent\r\nchapters. It was a small people that had for several months faced with\r\nundaunted front the gigantic power of Bonaparte and that of the Armed\r\nNeutrals.\r\n\r\nThis population of less than 18,000,000 souls, of which nearly\r\none-third openly resented the Act of Union recently imposed on\r\nIreland, was burdened by a National Debt which amounted to\r\n£537,000,000, and entailed a yearly charge of more than £20,000,000\r\nsterling. In the years of war with revolutionary France the annual\r\nexpenditure had risen from £19,859,000 (for 1792) to the total of\r\n£61,329,000, which necessitated an income tax of 10 per cent. on all\r\nincomes of £200 and upwards. Yet, despite party feuds, the nation was\r\nnever stronger, and its fleets had never won more brilliant and solid\r\ntriumphs. The chief naval historian of France admits that we had\r\ncaptured no fewer than 50 ships of the line, and had lost to our\r\nenemies only five, thereby raising the strength of our fighting line\r\nto 189, while that of France had sunk to 47.[181] The prowess of Sir\r\nArthur Wellesley was also beginning to revive in India the ancient\r\nlustre of the British arms; but the events of 1802-3 were to show that\r\nour industrial enterprise, and the exploits of our sailors and\r\nsoldiers, were by themselves of little avail when matched in a\r\ndiplomatic contest against the vast resources of France and the\r\nembodied might of a Napoleon.\r\n\r\nMen and institutions were everywhere receiving the imprint of his\r\nwill. France was as wax under his genius. The sovereigns of Spain,\r\nItaly, and Germany obeyed his _fiat_. Even the stubborn Dutch bent\r\nbefore him. On the plea of defeating Orange intrigues, he imposed a\r\nnew constitution on the Batavian Republic whose independence he had\r\nagreed to respect. Its Directory was now replaced by a Regency which\r\nrelieved the deputies of the people of all responsibility. A\r\n_plébiscite_ showed 52,000 votes against, and 16,000 for, the new\r\n_régime_; but, as 350,000 had not voted, their silence was taken for\r\nconsent, and Bonaparte's will became law (September, 1801).\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to appreciate the position of France and\r\nGreat Britain. Before the signature of the preliminaries of peace at\r\nLondon on October 1st, 1801, our Government had given up its claims to\r\nthe Cape, Malta, Tobago, Martinique, Essequibo, Demerara, Berbice, and\r\nCuraçoa, retaining of its conquests only Trinidad and Ceylon.\r\n\r\nA belated attempt had, indeed, been made to retain Tobago. The Premier\r\nand the Foreign Secretary, Lord Hawkesbury, were led by the French\r\npolitical agent in London, M. Otto, to believe that, in the ensuing\r\nnegotiations at Amiens, every facility would be given by the French\r\nGovernment towards its retrocession to us, and that this act would be\r\nregarded as the means of indemnifying Great Britain for the heavy\r\nexpense of supporting many thousands of French and Dutch prisoners.\r\nThe Cabinet, relying on this promise as binding between honourable\r\nmen, thereupon endeavoured to obtain the assent of George III. to the\r\npreliminaries in their ultimate form, and only the prospect of\r\nregaining Tobago by this compromise induced the King to give it. When\r\nit was too late, King and Ministers realized their mistake in relying\r\non verbal promises and in failing to procure a written statement.[182]\r\n\r\nThe abandonment by Ministers of their former claim to Malta is equally\r\nstrange. Nelson, though he held Malta to be useless as a base for the\r\nBritish fleet watching Toulon, made the memorable statement: \"I\r\nconsider Malta as a most important outwork to India.\" But a despatch\r\nfrom St. Petersburg, stating that the new Czar had concluded a formal\r\ntreaty of alliance with the Order of St. John settled in Russia, may\r\nhave convinced Addington and his colleagues that it would be better to\r\nforego all claim to Malta in order to cement the newly won friendship\r\nof Russia. Whatever may have been their motive, British Ministers\r\nconsented to cede the island to the Knights of St. John under the\r\nprotection of some third Power.\r\n\r\nThe preliminaries of peace were further remarkable for three strange\r\nomissions. They did not provide for the renewal of previous treaties\r\nof peace between the late combatants. War is held to break all\r\nprevious treaties; and by failing to require the renewal of the\r\ntreaties of 1713, 1763, and 1783, it was now open to Spain and France\r\nto cement, albeit in a new form, that Family Compact which it had long\r\nbeen the aim of British diplomacy to dissolve: the failure to renew\r\nthose earlier treaties rendered it possible for the Court of Madrid to\r\nalienate any of its colonies to France, as at that very time was being\r\narranged with respect to Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThe second omission was equally remarkable. No mention was made of any\r\nrenewal of commercial intercourse between England and France.\r\nDoubtless a complete settlement of this question would have been\r\ndifficult. British merchants would have looked for a renewal of that\r\nenlightened treaty of commerce of 1786-7, which had aroused the bitter\r\nopposition of French manufacturers. But the question might have been\r\nbroached at London, and its omission from the preliminaries served as\r\na reason for shelving it in the definitive treaty--a piece of folly\r\nwhich at once provoked the severest censure from British\r\nmanufacturers, who thereby lost the markets of France, and her subject\r\nStates, Holland, Spain, Switzerland, Genoa, and Etruria.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, the terms of peace provided no compensation either for\r\nthe French royal House or for the dispossessed House of Orange. Here\r\nagain, it would have been very difficult to find a recompense such as\r\nthe Bourbons could with dignity have accepted; and the suggestion made\r\nby one of the royalist exiles to Lord Hawkesbury, that Great Britain\r\nshould seize Crete and hand it over to them, will show how desperate\r\nwas their case.[183] Nevertheless, some effort should have been made\r\nby a Government which had so often proclaimed its championship of the\r\nlegitimist cause. Still more glaring was the omission of any\r\nstipulation for an indemnity for the House of Orange, now exiled from\r\nthe Batavian Republic. That claim, though urged at the outset, found\r\nno place in the preliminaries; and the mingled surprise and contempt\r\nfelt in the _salons_ of Paris at the conduct of the British Government\r\nis shown in a semi-official report sent thence by one of its secret\r\nagents:\r\n\r\n     \"I cannot get it into my head that the British Ministry has acted\r\n     in good faith in subscribing to preliminaries of peace, which,\r\n     considering the respective position of the parties, would be\r\n     harmful to the English people.... People are persuaded in France\r\n     that the moderation of England is only a snare put in Bonaparte's\r\n     way, and it is mainly in order to dispel it that our journals have\r\n     received the order to make much of the advantages which must accrue\r\n     to England from the conquests retained by her; but the journalists\r\n     have convinced nobody, and it is said openly that if our European\r\n     conquests are consolidated by a general peace, France will, within\r\n     ten years, subjugate all Europe, Great Britain included, despite\r\n     all her vast dominions in India. Only within the last few days have\r\n     people here believed in the sincerity of the English preliminaries\r\n     of peace, and they say everywhere that, after having gloriously\r\n     sailed past the rocks that Bonaparte's cunning had placed in its\r\n     track, the British Ministry has completely foundered at the mouth\r\n     of the harbour. People blame the whole structure of the peace as\r\n     betraying marks of feebleness in all that concerns the dignity and\r\n     the interests of the King; ... and we cannot excuse its neglect of\r\n     the royalists, whose interests are entirely set aside in the\r\n     preliminaries. Men are especially astonished at England's\r\n     retrocession of Martinique without a single stipulation for the\r\n     colonists there, who are at the mercy of a government as rapacious\r\n     as it is fickle. All the owners of colonial property are very\r\n     uneasy, and do not hide their annoyance against England on this\r\n     score.\"[184]\r\n\r\nThis interesting report gives a glimpse into the real thought of Paris\r\nsuch as is rarely afforded by the tamed or venal Press. As Bonaparte's\r\nspies enabled him to feel every throb of the French pulse, he must at\r\nonce have seen how great was the prestige which he gained by these\r\nfirst diplomatic successes, and how precarious was the foothold of the\r\nEnglish Ministers on the slippery grade of concession to which they\r\nhad been lured. Addington surely should have remembered that only the\r\nstrong man can with safety recede at the outset, and that an act of\r\nconcession which, coming from a master mind, is interpreted as one of\r\nnoble magnanimity, will be scornfully snatched from a nerveless hand\r\nas a sign of timorous complaisance. But the public statements and the\r\nsecret avowals of our leaders show that they wished \"to try the\r\nexperiment of peace,\" now that France had returned to ordinary\r\npolitical conditions and Jacobinism was curbed by Bonaparte.\r\n\"Perhaps,\" wrote Castlereagh, \"France, satisfied with her recent\r\nacquisitions, will find her interest in that system of internal\r\nimprovement which is necessarily connected with peace.\"[185] There is\r\nno reason for doubting the sincerity of this statement. Our policy was\r\ndistinctly and continuously complaisant: France regained her colonies:\r\nshe was not required to withdraw from Switzerland and Holland. Who\r\ncould expect, from what was then known of Bonaparte's character, that\r\na peace so fraught with glory and profit would not satisfy French\r\nhonour and his own ambition?\r\n\r\nPeace, then, was an \"experiment.\" The British Government wished to see\r\nwhether France would turn from revolution and war to agriculture and\r\ncommerce, whether her young ruler be satisfied with a position of\r\ngrandeur and solid power such as Louis XIV. had rarely enjoyed. Alas!\r\nthe failure of the experiment was patent to all save the blandest\r\noptimists long before the Preliminaries of London took form in the\r\ndefinitive Treaty of Amiens. Bonaparte's aim now was to keep our\r\nGovernment strictly to the provisional terms of peace which it had\r\nimprudently signed. Even before the negotiations were opened at\r\nAmiens, he ordered Joseph Bonaparte to listen to no proposal\r\nconcerning the King of Sardinia and the ex-Stadholder of Holland,\r\nand asserted that the \"internal affairs of the Batavian Republic, of\r\nGermany, of Helvetia, and of the Italian Republics\" were \"absolutely\r\nalien to the discussions with England.\" This implied that England was\r\nto be shut out from Continental politics, and that France was to\r\nregulate the affairs of central and southern Europe. This observance\r\nof the letter was, however, less rigid where French colonial and\r\nmaritime interests were at stake. Dextrous feelers were put forth\r\nseawards, and it was only when these were repulsed that the French\r\nnegotiators encased themselves in their preliminaries.\r\n\r\nThe task of reducing those articles to a definitive treaty devolved,\r\non the British side, on the Marquis Cornwallis, a gouty, world-weary\r\nold soldier, chiefly remembered for the surrender which ended the\r\nAmerican War. Nevertheless, he had everywhere won respect for his\r\npersonal probity in the administration of Indian affairs, and there\r\nmust also have been some convincing qualities in a personality which\r\ndrew from Napoleon at St. Helena the remark: \"I do not believe that\r\nCornwallis was a man of first-rate abilities: but he had talent, great\r\nprobity, sincerity, and never broke his word.... He was a man of\r\nhonour--a true Englishman.\"\r\n\r\nAgainst Lord Cornwallis, and his far abler secretary, Mr. Merry, were\r\npitted Joseph Bonaparte and his secretaries. The abilities of the\r\neldest of the Bonapartes have been much underrated. Though he lacked\r\nthe masterful force and wide powers of his second brother, yet at\r\nLunéville Joseph proved himself to be an able diplomatist, and later\r\non in his tenure of power at Naples and Madrid he displayed no small\r\nadministrative gifts. Moreover, his tact and kindliness kindled in all\r\nwho knew him a warmth of friendship such as Napoleon's sterner\r\nqualities rarely inspired. The one was loved as a man: for the other,\r\neven his earlier acquaintances felt admiration and devotion, but\r\nalways mingled with a certain fear of the demi-god that would at times\r\nblaze forth. This was the dread personality that urged Talleyrand and\r\nJoseph Bonaparte to their utmost endeavours and steeled them against\r\nany untoward complaisance at Amiens.\r\n\r\nThe selection of so honourable a man as Cornwallis afforded no slight\r\nguarantee for the sincerity of our Government, and its sincerity will\r\nstand the test of a perusal of its despatches. Having examined all\r\nthose that deal with these negotiations, the present writer can affirm\r\nthat the official instructions were in no respect modified by the\r\nsecret injunctions: these referred merely to such delicate and\r\npersonal topics as the evacuation of Hanover by Prussian troops and\r\nthe indemnities to be sought for the House of Orange and the House of\r\nSavoy. The circumstances of these two dispossessed dynasties were\r\nexplained so as to show that the former Dutch Stadholder had a very\r\nstrong claim on us, as well as on France and the Batavian Republic;\r\nwhile the championship of the House of Savoy by the Czar rendered the\r\nclaims of that ancient family on the intervention of George III. less\r\ndirect and personal than those of the Prince of Orange. Indeed,\r\nEngland would have insisted on the insertion of a clause to this\r\neffect in the preliminaries had not other arrangements been on foot at\r\nBerlin which promised to yield due compensation to this unfortunate\r\nprince. Doubtless the motives of the British Ministers were good, but\r\ntheir failure to insert such a clause fatally prejudiced their case\r\nall through the negotiations at Amiens.\r\n\r\nThe British official declaration respecting Malta was clear and\r\npractical. The island was to be restored to the Knights of the Order\r\nof St. John and placed under the protection of a third Power other\r\nthan France and England. But the reconstitution of the Order was no\r\nless difficult than the choice of a strong and disinterested\r\nprotecting Power. Lord Hawkesbury proposed that Russia be the\r\nguaranteeing Power. No proposal could have been more reasonable. The\r\nclaims of the Czar to the protectorate of the Order had been so\r\nrecently asserted by a treaty with the knights that no other\r\nconclusion seemed feasible. And, in order to assuage the grievances of\r\nthe islanders and strengthen the rule of the knights, the British\r\nMinistry desired that the natives of Malta should gain a foothold in\r\nthe new constitution. The lack of civil and political rights had\r\ncontributed so materially to the overthrow of the Order that no\r\nreconstruction of that shattered body could be deemed intelligent, or\r\neven honest, which did not cement its interests with those of the\r\nnative Maltese. The First Consul, however, at once demurred to both\r\nthese proposals. In the course of a long interview with Cornwallis at\r\nParis,[186] he adverted to the danger of bringing Russia's maritime\r\npressure to bear on Mediterranean questions, especially as her\r\nsovereigns \"had of late shown themselves to be such unsteady\r\npoliticians.\" This of course referred to the English proclivities of\r\nAlexander I., and it is clear that Bonaparte's annoyance with\r\nAlexander was the first unsettling influence which prevented the\r\nsolution of the Maltese question. The First Consul also admitted to\r\nCornwallis that the King of Naples, despite his ancient claims of\r\nsuzerainty over Malta, could not be considered a satisfactory\r\nguarantor, as between two Great Powers; and he then proposed that the\r\ntangle should be cut by blowing up the fortifications of Valetta.\r\n\r\nThe mere suggestion of such an act affords eloquent proof of the\r\ndifficulties besetting the whole question. To destroy works of vast\r\nextent, which were the bulwark of Christendom against the Barbary\r\npirates, would practically have involved the handing over of Valetta\r\nto those pests of the Mediterranean; and from Malta as a new base of\r\noperations they could have spread devastation along the coasts of\r\nSicily and Italy. This was the objection which Cornwallis at once\r\noffered to an other-wise specious proposal: he had recently received\r\npapers from Major-General Pigot at Malta, in which the same solution\r\nof the question was examined in detail. The British officer pointed\r\nout that the complete dismantling of the fortifications would expose\r\nthe island, and therefore the coasts of Italy, to the rovers; yet he\r\nsuggested a partial demolition, which seems to prove that the British\r\nofficers in command at Malta did not contemplate the retention of the\r\nisland and the infraction of the peace.\r\n\r\nOur Government, however, disapproved of the destruction of the\r\nfortifications of Valetta as wounding the susceptibilities of the\r\nCzar, and as in no wise rendering impossible the seizure of the island\r\nand the reconstruction of those works by some future invader. In fact,\r\nas the British Ministry now aimed above all at maintaining good\r\nrelations with the Czar, Bonaparte's proposal could only be regarded\r\nas an ingenious device for sundering the Anglo-Russian understanding.\r\nThe French Minister at St. Petersburg was doing his utmost to prevent\r\nthe _rapprochement_ of the Czar to the Court of St James, and was\r\nstriving to revive the moribund league of the Armed Neutrals. That\r\nlast offer had \"been rejected in the most peremptory manner and in\r\nterms almost bordering upon derision.\" Still there was reason to\r\nbelieve that the former Anglo-Russian disputes about Malta might be so\r\nfar renewed as to bring Bonaparte and Alexander to an understanding.\r\nThe sentimental Liberalism of the young Czar predisposed him towards a\r\nFrench alliance, and his whole disposition inclined him towards the\r\nbrilliant opportunism of Paris rather than the frigid legitimacy of\r\nthe Court of St. James. The Maltese affair and the possibility of\r\nreopening the Eastern Question were the two sources of hope to the\r\npromoters of a Franco-Russian alliance; for both these questions\r\nappealed to the chivalrous love of adventure and to the calculating\r\nambition so curiously blent in Alexander's nature. Such, then, was the\r\nmotive which doubtless prompted Bonaparte's proposal concerning\r\nValetta; such also were the reasons which certainly dictated its\r\nrejection by Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn his interview with the First Consul at Paris, and in the subsequent\r\nnegotiations at Amiens with Joseph Bonaparte, the question of Tobago\r\nand England's money claim for the support of French prisoners was\r\nfound to be no less thorny than that of Malta. The Bonapartes firmly\r\nrejected the proposal for the retention of Tobago by England in lieu\r\nof her pecuniary demand. A Government which neglected to procure the\r\ninsertion of its claim to Tobago among the Preliminaries of London\r\ncould certainly not hope to regain that island in exchange for a\r\nconcession to France that was in any degree disputable. But the two\r\nBonapartes and Talleyrand now took their stand solely on the\r\npreliminaries, and politely waved on one side the earlier promises of\r\nM. Otto as unauthorized and invalid, They also closely scrutinized the\r\nBritish claim to an indemnity for the support of French prisoners.\r\nThough theoretically correct, it was open to an objection, which was\r\nurged by Bonaparte and Talleyrand with suave yet incisive irony.\r\nThey suggested that the claim must be considered in relation to a\r\ncounter-claim, soon to be sent from Paris, for the maintenance of all\r\nprisoners taken by the French from the various forces subsidized by\r\nGreat Britain, a charge which \"would probably not leave a balance so\r\nmuch in favour of His [Britannic] Majesty as His Government may have\r\nlooked forward to.\" This retort was not so terrible as it appeared;\r\nfor most of the papers necessary for the making up of the French\r\ncounterclaim had been lost or destroyed during the Revolution. Yet the\r\nthreat told with full effect on Cornwallis, who thereafter referred to\r\nthe British claim as a \"hopeless debt.\"[187] The officials of Downing\r\nStreet drew a distinction between prisoners from armies merely\r\nsubsidized by us and those taken from foreign forces actually under\r\nour control; but it is clear that Cornwallis ceased to press the\r\nclaim. In fact, the British case was mismanaged from beginning to end:\r\nthe accounts for the maintenance of French and Dutch prisoners were,\r\nin the first instance, wrongly drawn up; and there seems to have been\r\nlittle or no notion of the seriousness of the counter-claim, which\r\ncame with all the effect of a volley from a masked battery,\r\ndestructive alike to our diplomatic reputation and to our hope of\r\nretaining Tobago.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to refer here to all the topics discussed at Amiens.\r\nThe determination of the French Government to adopt a forward colonial\r\nand oceanic policy is clearly seen in its proposals made at the close\r\nof the year 1801. They were: (1) the abolition of salutes to the\r\nBritish flag on the high seas; (2) an _absolute_ ownership of the\r\neastern and western coasts of Newfoundland in return for a proposed\r\ncession of the isles of St. Pierre and Miquelon to us--which would\r\nhave practically ceded to France _in full sovereignty_ all the best\r\nfishing coasts of that land, with every prospect of settling the\r\ninterior, in exchange for two islets devastated by war and then in\r\nBritish hands; (3) the right of the French to a share in the whale\r\nfishery in those seas; (4) the establishment of a French fishing\r\nstation in the Falkland Isles; and (5) the extension of the French\r\ndistricts around the towns of Yanaon and Mahé in India.[188] To all\r\nthese demands Lord Cornwallis opposed an unbending opposition. Weak as\r\nour policy had been on other affairs, it was firm as a rock on all\r\nmaritime and Indian questions. In fact, the events to be described in\r\nthe next chapter, which led to the consolidation of British power in\r\nHindostan, would in all probability never have occurred but for the\r\napprehensions excited by these French demands; and our masterful\r\nproconsul in Bengal, the Marquis Wellesley, could not have pursued his\r\ndaring and expensive schemes of conquest, annexation, and forced\r\nalliances, had not the schemes of the First Consul played into the\r\nhands of the soldiers at Calcutta and weakened the protests of the\r\ndividend-hunters of Leadenhall Street.\r\n\r\nThe persistence of French demands for an increase of influence in\r\nNewfoundland and the West and East Indies, the vastness of her\r\nexpedition to Saint Domingo and the thinly-veiled designs of her\r\nAustralian expedition (which we shall notice in the next chapter), all\r\nserved to awaken the suspicions of the British Government. The\r\nnegotiations consequently progressed but slowly. From the outset they\r\nwere clogged by the suspicion of bad faith. Spain and Holland, smarting\r\nunder the conditions of a peace which gave to France all the glory and\r\nto her allies all the loss, delayed sending their respective envoys to\r\nthe conferences at Amiens, and finally avowed their determination to\r\nresist the surrender of Trinidad and Ceylon. In fact, pressure had to\r\nbe exerted from Paris and London before they yielded to the inevitable.\r\nThis difficulty was only one of several: there then remained the\r\nquestions whether Portugal and Turkey should be admitted to share in the\r\ntreaty, as England demanded; or whether they should sign a separate\r\npeace with France. The First Consul strenuously insisted on the\r\nexclusion of those States, though their interests were vitally affected\r\nby the present negotiations, He saw that a separate treaty with the\r\nSublime Porte would enable him, not only to extract valuable trading\r\nconcessions in the Black Sea trade, but also to cement a good\r\nunderstanding with Russia on the Eastern Question, which was now being\r\nadroitly reopened by French diplomacy. Against the exclusion of Turkey\r\nfrom the negotiations at Amiens, Great Britain firmly but vainly\r\nprotested. In fact, Talleyrand had bound the Porte to a separate\r\nagreement which promised everything for France and nothing for Turkey,\r\nand seemed to doom the Sublime Porte to certain humiliation and probable\r\npartition.[189]\r\n\r\nThen there were the vexed questions of the indemnities claimed by\r\nGeorge III. for the Houses of Orange and of Savoy. In his interview\r\nwith Cornwallis, Bonaparte had effusively promised to do his utmost\r\nfor the ex-Stadholder, though he refused to consider the case of the\r\nKing of Sardinia, who, he averred, had offended him by appealing to\r\nthe Czar. The territorial interests of France in Italy doubtless\r\noffered a more potent argument to the First Consul: after practically\r\nannexing Piedmont and dominating the peninsula, he could ill brook\r\nthe presence on the mainland of a king whom he had already sacrificed\r\nto his astute and masterful policy. The case of the Prince of Orange\r\nwas different. He was a victim to the triumph of French and democratic\r\ninfluence in the Dutch Netherlands. George III. felt a deep interest\r\nin this unfortunate prince and made a strong appeal to the better\r\ninstincts of Bonaparte on his behalf. Indeed, it is probable that\r\nEngland had acquiesced in the consolidation of French influence at the\r\nHague, in the hope that her complaisance would lead the First Consul\r\nto assure him some position worthy of so ancient a House. But though\r\nCornwallis pressed the Batavian Republic on behalf of its exiled\r\nchief, yet the question was finally adjourned by the XVIIIth clause of\r\nthe definitive Treaty of Amiens; and the scion of that famous House\r\nhad to take his share in the forthcoming scramble for the clerical\r\ndomains of Germany.[190]\r\n\r\nFor the still more difficult cause of the House of Savoy the British\r\nGovernment made honest but unavailing efforts, firmly refusing to\r\nrecognize the newest creations of Bonaparte in Italy, namely, the\r\nKingdom of Etruria and the Ligurian Republic, until he indemnified the\r\nHouse of Savoy. Our recognition was withheld for the reasons that\r\nprompt every bargainer to refuse satisfaction to his antagonist until\r\nan equal concession is accorded. This game was played by both Powers\r\nat Amiens, and with little other result than mutual exasperation. Yet\r\nhere, too, the balance of gain naturally accrued to Bonaparte; for he\r\nrequired the British Ministry to recognize existing facts in Etruria\r\nand Liguria, while Cornwallis had to champion the cause of exiles and\r\nof an order that seemed for ever to have vanished. To pit the\r\nnon-existent against the actual was a task far above the powers of\r\nBritish statesmanship; yet that was to be its task for the next\r\ndecade, while the forces of the living present were to be wielded by\r\nits mighty antagonist. Herein lay the secret of British failures and\r\nof Napoleon's extraordinary triumphs.\r\n\r\nLeaving, for a space, the negotiations at Amiens, we turn to consider\r\nthe events which transpired at Lyons in the early weeks of 1802,\r\nevents which influenced not only the future of Italy, but the fortunes\r\nof Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that, after the French victories of Marengo and\r\nHohenlinden, Austria agreed to terms of peace whereby the Cisalpine,\r\nLigurian, Helvetic, and Batavian Republics were formally recognized by\r\nher, though a clause expressly stipulated that they were to be\r\nindependent of France. A vain hope! They continued to be under French\r\ntutelage, and their strongholds in the possession of French troops.\r\n\r\nIt now remained to legalize French supremacy in the Cisalpine\r\nRepublic, which comprised the land between the Ticino and the Adige,\r\nand the Alps and the Rubicon. The new State received a provisional\r\nform of government after Marengo, a small council being appointed to\r\nsupervise civil affairs at the capital, Milan. With it and with\r\nMarescalchi, the Cisalpine envoy at Paris, Bonaparte had concerted a\r\nconstitution, or rather he had used these men as a convenient screen\r\nto hide its purely personal origin. Having, for form's sake, consulted\r\nthe men whom he had himself appointed, he now suggested that the chief\r\ncitizens of that republic should confer with him respecting their new\r\ninstitutions. His Minister at Milan thereupon proposed that they\r\nshould cross the Alps for that purpose, assembling, not at Paris,\r\nwhere their dependence on the First Consul's will might provoke too\r\nmuch comment, but at Lyons. To that city, accordingly, there repaired\r\nsome 450 of the chief men of Northern Italy, who braved the snows of a\r\nmost rigorous December, in the hope of consolidating the liberties of\r\ntheir long-distracted country. And thus was seen the strange spectacle\r\nof the organization of Lombardy, Modena, and the Legations being\r\neffected in one provincial centre of France, while at another of her\r\ncities the peace of Europe and the fortunes of two colonial empires\r\nwere likewise at stake. Such a conjunction of events might well\r\nimpress the imagination of men, bending the stubborn will of the\r\nnorthern islanders, and moulding the Italian notables to complete\r\ncomplaisance. And yet, such power was there in the nascent idea of\r\nItalian nationality, that Bonaparte's proposals, which, in his\r\nabsence, were skilfully set forth by Talleyrand, met with more than\r\none rebuff from the Consulta at Lyons.\r\n\r\nBitterly it opposed the declaration that the Roman Catholic religion\r\nwas the religion of the Cisalpine Republic and must be maintained by a\r\nState budget. Only the first part of this proposal could be carried:\r\nso keen was the opposition to the second part that, as a preferable\r\nplan, property was set apart for the support of the clergy; and\r\nclerical discipline was subjected to the State, on terms somewhat\r\nsimilar to those of the French Concordat.[191]\r\n\r\nSecular affairs gave less trouble. The apparent success of the French\r\nconstitution furnished a strong motive for adopting one of a similar\r\ncharacter for the Italian State; and as the proposed institutions had\r\nbeen approved at Milan, their acceptance by a large and miscellaneous\r\nbody was a foregone conclusion. Talleyrand also took the most\r\nunscrupulous care that the affair of the Presidency should be\r\njudiciously settled. On December 31st, 1801, he writes to Bonaparte\r\nfrom Lyons:\r\n\r\n     \"The opinion of the Cisalpines seems not at all decided as to the\r\n     choice to be made: they will gladly receive the man whom you\r\n     nominate: a President in France and a Vice-President at Milan would\r\n     suit a large number of them.\"\r\n\r\nFour days later he confidently assures the First Consul:\r\n\r\n     \"They will do what you want without your needing even to show your\r\n     desire. What they think you desire will immediately become\r\n     law.\"[192]\r\n\r\nThe ground having been thus thoroughly worked, Bonaparte and\r\nJosephine, accompanied by a brilliant suite, arrived at Lyons on\r\nJanuary 11th, and met with an enthusiastic reception. Despite the\r\nintense cold, followed by a sudden thaw, a brilliant series of fêtes,\r\nparades, and receptions took place; and several battalions of the\r\nFrench Army of Egypt, which had recently been conveyed home on English\r\nships, now passed in review before their chief. The impressionable\r\nItalians could not mistake the aim of these demonstrations; and, after\r\ngeneral matters had been arranged by the notables, the final measures\r\nwere relegated to a committee of thirty. The desirability of this step\r\nwas obvious, for urgent protests had already been raised in the\r\nConsulta against the appointment of a foreigner as President of the\r\nnew State. When a hubbub arose on this burning topic:\r\n\r\n     \"Some officers of the regiments in garrison at Lyons appeared in\r\n     the hall and imposed silence upon all parties. Notwithstanding\r\n     this, Count Melzi was actually chosen President by the majority of\r\n     the Committee of Thirty; but he declined the honour, and suggested\r\n     in significant terms that, to enable him to render any service to\r\n     the country, the committee had better fix upon General Bonaparte as\r\n     their Chief Magistrate. This being done, Bonaparte immediately\r\n     appointed Count Melzi Vice-President.\"[193]\r\n\r\nBonaparte's determination to fill this important position is clearly\r\nseen in his correspondence. On the 2nd and 4th of Pluviôse (January\r\n22nd and 24th), he writes from Lyons:\r\n\r\n     \"All the principal affairs of the Consulta are settled. I count on\r\n     being back at Paris in the course of the decade.\"\r\n\r\n     \"To-morrow I shall review the troops from Egypt. On the 6th [of\r\n     Pluviôse] all the business of the Consulta will be finished, and I\r\n     shall probably set out on my journey on the 7th.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, 5th Pluviôse, sees the accomplishment of his desires:\r\n\r\n     \"To-day I have reviewed the troops on the Place Bellecour; the sun\r\n     shone as it does in Floréal. The Consulta has named a committee of\r\n     thirty individuals, which has reported to it that, considering the\r\n     domestic and foreign affairs of the Cisalpine, it was indispensable\r\n     to let me discharge the first magistracy, until circumstances\r\n     permit and I judge it suitable to appoint a successor.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts prove that the acts of the Consulta could be planned\r\nbeforehand no less precisely than the movements of the soldiery, and\r\nthat even so complex a matter as the voting of a constitution and the\r\nchoice of its chief had to fall in with the arrangements of this\r\nmethodizing genius. Certainly civilization had progressed since the\r\nweary years when the French people groped through mists and waded in\r\nblood in order to gain a perfect polity: that precious boon was now\r\nconferred on a neighbouring people in so sure a way that the plans of\r\ntheir benefactor could be infallibly fixed and his return to Paris\r\ncalculated to the hour.\r\n\r\nThe final address uttered by Bonaparte to the Italian notables is\r\nremarkable for the short, sharp sentences, which recall the tones of\r\nthe parade ground. Passing recent events in rapid review, he said,\r\nspeaking in his mother tongue:\r\n\r\n     \"...Every effort had been made to dismember you: the protection of\r\n     France won the day: you have been recognized at Lunéville.\r\n     One-fifth larger than before, you are now more powerful, more\r\n     consolidated, and have wider hopes. Composed of six different\r\n     nations, you will be now united under a constitution the best\r\n     possible for your social and material condition. ... The selections\r\n     I have made for your chief offices have been made independently of\r\n     all idea of party or feeling of locality. As for that of President,\r\n     I have found no one among you with sufficient claims on public\r\n     opinion, sufficiently free from local feelings, and who had\r\n     rendered great enough services to his country, to intrust it to\r\n     him.... Your people has only local feelings: it must now rise to\r\n     national feelings.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this last grand and prophetic remark, the name\r\nItalian was substituted for that of Cisalpine: and thus, for the first\r\ntime since the Middle Ages, there reappeared on the map of Europe that\r\nname, which was to evoke the sneers of diplomatists and the most\r\nexalted patriotism of the century. If Bonaparte had done naught else,\r\nhe would deserve immortal glory for training the divided peoples of\r\nthe peninsula for a life of united activity.\r\n\r\nThe new constitution was modelled on that of France; but the pretence\r\nof a democratic suffrage was abandoned. The right of voting was\r\naccorded to three classes, the great proprietors, the clerics and\r\nlearned men, and the merchants. These, meeting in their several\r\n\"Electoral Colleges,\" voted for the members of the legislative bodies;\r\na Tribunal was also charged with the maintenance of the constitution.\r\nBy these means Bonaparte endeavoured to fetter the power of the\r\nreactionaries no less than the anti-clerical fervour of the Italian\r\nJacobins. The blending of the new and the old which then began shows\r\nthe hand of the master builder, who neither sweeps away materials\r\nmerely because they are old, nor rejects the strength that comes from\r\nimproved methods of construction: and, however much we may question\r\nthe disinterestedness of his motives in this great enterprise, there\r\ncan be but one opinion as to the skill of the methods and the\r\nbeneficence of the results in Italy.[194]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first step in the process of Italian unification had now been\r\ntaken at Lyons. A second soon followed. The affairs of the Ligurian\r\nRepublic were in some confusion; and an address came from Genoa\r\nbegging that their differences might be composed by the First Consul.\r\nThe spontaneity of this offer may well be questioned, seeing that\r\nBonaparte found it desirable, in his letter of February 18th, 1802, to\r\nassure the Ligurian authorities that they need feel no disquietude as\r\nto the independence of their republic. Bonaparte undertook to alter\r\ntheir constitution and nominate their Doge.\r\n\r\nThat the news of the events at Lyons excited the liveliest indignation\r\nin London is evident from Hawkesbury's despatch of February 12th,\r\n1802, to Cornwallis:\r\n\r\n     \"The proceedings at Lyons have created the greatest alarm in this\r\n     country, and there are many persons who were pacifically disposed,\r\n     who since this event are desirous of renewing the war. It is\r\n     impossible to be surprised at this feeling when we consider the\r\n     inordinate ambition, the gross breach of faith, and the inclination\r\n     to insult Europe manifested by the First Consul on this occasion.\r\n     The Government here are desirous of avoiding to take notice of\r\n     these proceedings, and are sincerely desirous to conclude the\r\n     peace, if it can be obtained on terms consistent with our honour.\"\r\n\r\nWhy the Government should have lagged behind the far surer instincts\r\nof English public opinion it is difficult to say. Hawkesbury's\r\ndespatch of four days later supplies an excuse for his contemptible\r\ndevice of pretending not to see this glaring violation of the Treaty\r\nof Lunéville. Referring to the events at Lyons, he writes:\r\n\r\n     \"Extravagant and unjustifiable as they are in themselves, [they]\r\n     must have led us to believe that the First Consul would have been\r\n     more anxious than ever to have closed his account with this\r\n     country.\"\r\n\r\nDoubtless that was the case, but only on condition that England\r\nremained passive while French domination was extended over all\r\nneighbouring lands. If our Ministers believed that Bonaparte feared\r\nthe displeasure of Austria, they were completely in error. Thanks to\r\nthe utter weakness of the European system, and the rivalry of Austria\r\nand Prussia, he was now able to concentrate his ever-increasing power\r\nand prestige on the negotiations at Amiens, which once more claim our\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nFar from being sated by the prestige gained at Lyons, he seemed to\r\ngrow more exacting with victory. Moreover, he had been cut to the\r\nquick by some foolish articles of a French _émigré_ named Peltier, in\r\na paper published at London: instead of treating them with the\r\ncontempt they deserved, he magnified these ravings of a disappointed\r\nexile into an event of high policy, and fulminated against the\r\nGovernment which allowed them. In vain did Cornwallis object that the\r\nAddington Cabinet could not venture on the unpopular act of curbing\r\nfreedom of the Press in Great Britain. The First Consul, who had\r\nexperienced no such difficulty in France, persisted now, as a year\r\nlater, in considering every uncomplimentary reference to himself as an\r\nindirect and semiofficial attack.\r\n\r\nTo these causes we may attribute the French demands of February 4th:\r\ncontradicting his earlier proposal for a temporary Neapolitan garrison\r\nof Malta, Bonaparte now absolutely refused either to grant that\r\nnecessary protection to the weak Order of St. John, or to join Great\r\nBritain in an equal share of the expenses--£20,000 a year--which such\r\na garrison would entail. The astonishment and indignation aroused at\r\nDowning Street nearly led to an immediate rupture of the negotiations;\r\nand it needed all the patience of Cornwallis and the suavity of Joseph\r\nBonaparte to smooth away the asperities caused by Napoleon's direct\r\nintervention. It needs only a slight acquaintance with the First\r\nConsul's methods of thought and expression to recognize in the\r\nProtocol of February 4th the incisive speech of an autocrat confident\r\nin his newly-consolidated powers and irritated by the gibes of\r\nPeltier.[195]\r\n\r\nThe good sense of the two plenipotentiaries at Amiens before long\r\neffected a reconciliation. Hawkesbury, writing from Downing Street,\r\nwarned Cornwallis that if a rupture were to take place it must not be\r\nowing to \"any impatience on our part\": and he, in his turn, affably\r\ninquired from Joseph Bonaparte whether he had any more practicable\r\nplan than that of a Neapolitan garrison, which he had himself\r\nproposed. No plan was forthcoming other than that of a garrison of\r\n1,000 Swiss mercenaries; and as this was open to grave objections, the\r\noriginal proposal was finally restored. On its side, the Court of St.\r\nJames still refused to blow up the fortifications at Valetta; and\r\nrather than destroy those works, England had already offered that the\r\nindependence of Malta should be guaranteed by the Great Powers--Great\r\nBritain, France, Austria, Russia, Spain, and Prussia: to this\r\narrangement France soon assented. Later on we demanded that the\r\nNeapolitan garrison should remain in Malta for three years after the\r\nevacuation of the island by the British troops; whereas France desired\r\nto limit the period to one year. To this Cornwallis finally assented,\r\nwith the proviso that, \"if the Order of St. John shall not have raised\r\na sufficient number of men, the Neapolitan troops shall remain until\r\nthey shall be relieved by an adequate force, to be agreed upon by the\r\nguaranteeing Powers.\" The question of the garrison having been\r\narranged, other details gave less trouble, and the Maltese question\r\nwas settled in the thirteen conditions added to Clause X. of the\r\ndefinitive treaty.\r\n\r\nThough this complex question was thus adjusted by March 17th, other\r\nmatters delayed a settlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHawkesbury still demanded a definite indemnity for the Prince of\r\nOrange, but Cornwallis finally assented to Article XVIII. of the\r\ntreaty, which vaguely promised \"an adequate compensation.\" Cornwallis\r\nalso persuaded his chief to waive his claims for the direct\r\nparticipation of Turkey in the treaty. The British demand for an\r\nindemnity for the expense of supporting French prisoners was to be\r\nrelegated to commissioners--who never met. Indeed, this was the only\r\npolite way of escaping from the untenable position which our\r\nGovernment had heedlessly taken upon this topic.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the concluding despatches of Cornwallis that he was\r\nwheedled by Joseph Bonaparte into conceding more than the British\r\nGovernment had empowered him to do; and, though the \"secret and most\r\nconfidential\" despatch of March 22nd cautioned him against narrowing\r\ntoo much the ground of a rupture, if a rupture should still occur, yet\r\nthree days later, and _after the receipt of this despatch_, he signed\r\nthe terms of peace with Joseph Bonaparte, and two days later with the\r\nother signatory Powers.[196] It may well be doubted whether peace\r\nwould ever have been signed but for the skill of Joseph Bonaparte in\r\npolite cajolery and the determination of Cornwallis to arrive at an\r\nunderstanding. In any case the final act of signature was distinctly\r\nthe act, not of the British Government, but of its plenipotentiary.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat fact is confirmed by his admission, on March 28th, that he had\r\nyielded where he was ordered to remain inflexible. At St. Helena,\r\nNapoleon also averred that after Cornwallis had definitely pledged\r\nhimself to sign the treaty as it stood on the night of March 24th, he\r\nreceived instructions in a contrary sense from Downing Street; that\r\nnevertheless he held himself bound by his promise and signed the\r\ntreaty on the following day, observing that his Government, if\r\ndissatisfied, might refuse to ratify it, but that, having pledged his\r\nword, he felt bound to abide by it. This story seems consonant with\r\nthe whole behaviour of Cornwallis, so creditable to him as a man, so\r\ndamaging to him as a diplomatist. The later events of the negotiation\r\naroused much annoyance at Downing Street, and the conduct of\r\nCornwallis met with chilling disapproval.\r\n\r\nThe First Consul, on the other hand, showed his appreciation of his\r\nbrother's skill with unusual warmth; for when they appeared together\r\nat the opera in Paris, he affectionately thrust his elder brother to\r\nthe front of the State box to receive the plaudits of the audience at\r\nthe advent of a definite peace. That was surely the purest and noblest\r\njoy which the brothers ever tasted.\r\n\r\nWith what feelings of pride, not unmixed with awe, must the brothers\r\nhave surveyed their career. Less than nine years had elapsed since\r\ntheir family fled from Corsica, and landed on the coast of Provence,\r\napparently as bankrupt in their political hopes as in their material\r\nfortunes. Thrice did the fickle goddess cast Napoleon to the ground in\r\nthe first two years of his new life, only that his wondrous gifts and\r\nsublime self-confidence might tower aloft the more conspicuously,\r\nbewildering alike the malcontents of Paris, the generals of the old\r\nEmpire, the peoples of the Levant, and the statesmen of Britain. Of\r\nall these triumphs assuredly the last was not the least. The Peace of\r\nAmiens left France the arbitress of Europe, and, by restoring to her\r\nall her lost colonies, it promised to place her in the van of the\r\noceanic and colonizing peoples.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nA FRENCH COLONIAL EMPIRE\r\n\r\nST. DOMINGO--LOUISIANA--INDIA--AUSTRALIA\r\n\r\n     \"Il n'y a rien dans l'histoire du monde de comparable aux forces\r\n     navales de l'Angleterre, à l'étendue et à la richesse de son\r\n     commerce, à la masse de ses dettes, de ses défenses, de ses moyens,\r\n     et à la fragilité des bases sur lesquelles repose l'édifice immense\r\n     de sa fortune.\"--BARON MALOUET, _Considérations historiques sur\r\n     l'Empire de la Mer_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are abundant reasons for thinking that Napoleon valued the Peace\r\nof Amiens as a necessary preliminary to the restoration of the French\r\nColonial Empire. A comparison of the dates at which he set on foot his\r\noceanic schemes will show that they nearly all had their inception in\r\nthe closing months of 1801 and in the course of the following year.\r\nThe sole important exceptions were the politico-scientific expedition\r\nto Australia, the ostensible purpose of which insured immunity from\r\nthe attacks of English cruisers even in the year 1800, and the plans\r\nfor securing French supremacy in Egypt, which had been frustrated in\r\n1801 and were, to all appearance, abandoned by the First Consul\r\naccording to the provisions of the Treaty of Amiens. The question\r\nwhether he really relinquished his designs on Egypt is so intimately\r\nconnected with the rupture of the Peace of Amiens that it will be more\r\nfitly considered in the following chapter. It may not, however, be out\r\nof place to offer some proofs as to the value which Bonaparte set on\r\nthe valley of the Nile and the Isthmus of Suez. A letter from a spy at\r\nParis, preserved in the archives of our Foreign Office, and dated\r\nJuly 10th, 1801, contains the following significant statement with\r\nreference to Bonaparte: \"Egypt, which is considered here as lost to\r\nFrance, is the only object which interests his personal ambition and\r\nexcites his revenge.\" Even at the end of his days, he thought\r\nlongingly of the land of the Pharaohs. In his first interview with the\r\ngovernor of St. Helena, the illustrious exile said emphatically:\r\n\"Egypt is the most important country in the world.\" The words reveal a\r\nkeen perception of all the influences conducive to commercial\r\nprosperity and imperial greatness. Egypt, in fact, with the Suez\r\nCanal, which his imagination always pictured as a necessary adjunct,\r\nwas to be the keystone of that arch of empire which was to span the\r\noceans and link the prairies of the far west to the teeming plains of\r\nIndia and the far Austral Isles.\r\n\r\nThe motives which impelled Napoleon to the enterprises now to be\r\nconsidered were as many-sided as the maritime ventures themselves.\r\nUltimately, doubtless, they arose out of a love of vast undertakings\r\nthat ministered at once to an expanding ambition and to that need of\r\narduous administrative toils for which his mind ever craved in the\r\nheyday of its activity. And, while satiating the grinding powers of\r\nhis otherwise morbidly restless spirit, these enterprises also fed and\r\nsoothed those imperious, if unconscious, instincts which prompt every\r\nable man of inquiring mind to reclaim all possible domains from the\r\nunknown or the chaotic. As Egypt had, for the present at least, been\r\nreft from his grasp, he turned naturally to all other lands that could\r\nbe forced to yield their secrets to the inquirer, or their comforts to\r\nthe benefactors of mankind. Only a dull cynicism can deny this motive\r\nto the man who first unlocked the doors of Egyptian civilization; and\r\nit would be equally futile to deny to him the same beneficent aims\r\nwith regard to the settlement of the plains of the Mississippi, and\r\nthe coasts of New Holland.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities of the condition of France furnished another\r\npowerful impulse towards colonization. In the last decade her people\r\nhad suffered from an excess of mental activity and nervous excitement.\r\nFrom philosophical and political speculation they must be brought back\r\nto the practical and prosaic; and what influence could be so healthy\r\nas the turning up of new soil and other processes that satisfy the\r\nprimitive instincts? Some of these, it was true, were being met by the\r\nincreasing peasant proprietary in France herself. But this internal\r\ndevelopment, salutary as it was, could not appease the restless\r\nspirits of the towns or the ambition of the soldiery. Foreign\r\nadventures and oceanic commerce alone could satisfy the Parisians and\r\nopen up new careers for the Prætorian chiefs, whom the First Consul\r\nalone really feared.\r\n\r\nNor were these sentiments felt by him alone. In a paper which\r\nTalleyrand read to the Institute of France in July, 1797, that\r\nfar-seeing statesman had dwelt upon the pacifying influences exerted\r\nby foreign commerce and colonial settlements on a too introspective\r\nnation. His words bear witness to the keenness of his insight into the\r\nmaladies of his own people and the sources of social and political\r\nstrength enjoyed by the United States, where he had recently\r\nsojourned. Referring to their speedy recovery from the tumults of\r\ntheir revolution, he said: \"The true Lethe after passing through a\r\nrevolution is to be found in the opening out to men of every avenue of\r\nhope.--Revolutions leave behind them a general restlessness of mind, a\r\nneed of movement.\" That need was met in America by man's warfare\r\nagainst the forest, the flood, and the prairie. France must therefore\r\npossess colonies as intellectual and political safety-valves; and in\r\nhis graceful, airy style he touched on the advantages offered by\r\nEgypt, Louisiana, and West Africa, both for their intrinsic value and\r\nas opening the door of work and of hope to a brain-sick generation.\r\n\r\nFollowing up this clue, Bonaparte, at a somewhat later date, remarked\r\nthe tendency of the French people, now that the revolutionary strifes\r\nwere past, to settle down contentedly on their own little plots; and\r\nhe emphasized the need of a colonial policy such as would widen the\r\nnational life. The remark has been largely justified by events; and\r\ndoubtless he discerned in the agrarian reforms of the Revolution an\r\ninfluence unfavourable to that racial dispersion which, under wise\r\nguidance, builds up an oceanic empire. The grievances of the _ancien\r\nrégime_ had helped to scatter on the shores of the St. Lawrence the\r\nseeds of a possible New France. Primogeniture was ever driving from\r\nEngland her younger sons to found New Englands and expand the commerce\r\nof the motherland. Let not France now rest at home, content with her\r\nperfect laws and with the conquest of her \"natural frontiers.\" Let her\r\nrather strive to regain the first place in colonial activity which the\r\nfollies of Louis XV. and the secular jealousy of Albion had filched\r\nfrom her. In the effort she would extend the bounds of civilization,\r\nlay the ghost of Jacobinism, satisfy military and naval adventures,\r\nand unconsciously revert to the ideas and governmental methods of the\r\nage of _le grand monarque_.\r\n\r\nThe French possessions beyond the seas had never shrunk to a smaller\r\narea than in the closing years of the late war with England. The fact\r\nwas confessed by the First Consul in his letter of October 7th, 1801,\r\nto Decrès, the Minister for the Navy and the Colonies: \"Our\r\npossessions beyond the sea, which are now in our power, are limited to\r\nSaint Domingo, Guadeloupe, the Isle of France (Mauritius), the Isle of\r\nBourbon, Senegal, and Guiana.\" After rendering this involuntary homage\r\nto the prowess of the British navy, Bonaparte proceeded to describe\r\nthe first measures for the organization of these colonies: for not\r\nuntil March 25th, 1802, when the definitive treaty of peace was\r\nsigned, could the others be regained by France.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFirst in importance came the re-establishment of French authority in\r\nthe large and fertile island of Hayti, or St. Domingo. It needs an\r\neffort of the imagination for the modern reader to realize the immense\r\nimportance of the West Indian islands at the beginning of the\r\ncentury, whose close found them depressed and half bankrupt. At the\r\nearlier date, when the name Australia was unknown, and the\r\nhalf-starved settlement in and around Sydney represented the sole\r\nwealth of that isle of continent; when the Cape of Good Hope was\r\nlooked on only as a port of call; when the United States numbered less\r\nthan five and a half million souls, and the waters of the Mississippi\r\nrolled in unsullied majesty past a few petty Spanish stations--the\r\nplantations of the West Indies seemed the unfailing mine of colonial\r\nindustry and commerce. Under the _ancien régime_, the trade of the\r\nFrench portion of San Domingo is reported to have represented more\r\nthan half of her oceanic commerce. But during the Revolution the\r\nprosperity of that colony reeled under a terrible blow.\r\n\r\nThe hasty proclamation of equality between whites and blacks by the\r\nFrench revolutionists, and the refusal of the planters to recognize\r\nthat decree as binding, led to a terrible servile revolt, which\r\ndesolated the whole of the colony. Those merciless strifes had,\r\nhowever, somewhat abated under the organizing power of a man, in whom\r\nthe black race seemed to have vindicated its claims to political\r\ncapacity. Toussaint l'Ouverture had come to the front by sheer\r\nsagacity and force of character. By a deft mixture of force and\r\nclemency, he imposed order on the vapouring crowds of negroes: he\r\nrestored the French part of the island to comparative order and\r\nprosperity; and with an army of 20,000 men he occupied the Spanish\r\nportion. In this, as in other matters, he appeared to act as the\r\nmandatory of France; but he looked to the time when France, beset by\r\nEuropean wars, would tacitly acknowledge his independence. In May,\r\n1801, he made a constitution for the island, and declared himself\r\ngovernor for life, with power to appoint his successor. This mimicry\r\nof the consular office, and the open vaunt that he was the \"Bonaparte\r\nof the Antilles,\" incensed Bonaparte; and the haste with which, on\r\nthe day after the Preliminaries of London, he prepared to overthrow\r\nthis contemptible rival, tells its own tale.\r\n\r\nYet Corsican hatred was tempered with Corsican guile. Toussaint had\r\nrequested that the Haytians should be under the protection of their\r\nformer mistress. Protection was the last thing that Bonaparte desired;\r\nbut he deemed it politic to flatter the black chieftain with\r\nassurances of his personal esteem and gratitude for the \"great\r\nservices which you have rendered to the French people. If its flag\r\nfloats over St. Domingo it is due to you and your brave blacks\"--a\r\nreference to Toussaint's successful resistance to English attempts at\r\nlanding. There were, it is true, some points in the new Haytian\r\nconstitution which contravened the sovereign rights of France, but\r\nthese were pardonable in the difficult circumstances which had pressed\r\non Toussaint: he was now, however, invited to amend them so as to\r\nrecognize the complete sovereignty of the motherland and the authority\r\nof General Leclerc, whom Bonaparte sent out as captain-general of the\r\nisland. To this officer, the husband of Pauline Bonaparte, the First\r\nConsul wrote on the same day that there was reported to be much\r\nferment in the island against Toussaint, that the obstacles to be\r\novercome would therefore be much less formidable than had been feared,\r\nprovided that activity and firmness were used. In his references to\r\nthe burning topic of slavery, the First Consul showed a similar\r\nreserve. The French Republic having abolished it, he could not, as\r\nyet, openly restore an institution flagrantly opposed to the Rights of\r\nMan. Ostensibly therefore he figured as the champion of emancipation,\r\nassuring the Haytians in his proclamation of November 8th, 1801, that\r\nthey were all free and all equal in the sight of God and of the\r\nFrench Republic: \"If you are told, 'These forces are destined to\r\nsnatch your liberty from you,' reply, 'The Republic has given us our\r\nliberty: it will not allow it to be taken from us.'\" Of a similar\r\ntenor was his public declaration a fortnight later, that at St.\r\nDomingo and Guadeloupe everybody was free and would remain free. Very\r\ndifferent were his private instructions. On the last day of October he\r\nordered Talleyrand to write to the British Government, asking for\r\ntheir help in supplying provisions from Jamaica to this expedition\r\ndestined to \"destroy the new Algiers being organized in American\r\nwaters\"; and a fortnight later he charged him to state his resolve to\r\ndestroy the government of the blacks at St. Domingo; that if he had to\r\npostpone the expedition for a year, he would be \"obliged to constitute\r\nthe blacks as French\"; and that \"the liberty of the blacks, if\r\nrecognized by the Government, would always be a support for the\r\nRepublic in the New World.\" As he was striving to cajole our\r\nGovernment into supporting his expedition, it is clear that in the\r\nlast enigmatic phrase he was bidding for that support by the hint of a\r\nprospective restoration of slavery at St. Domingo. A comparison of his\r\npublic and private statements must have produced a curious effect on\r\nthe British Ministers, and many of the difficulties during the\r\nnegotiations at Amiens doubtless sprang out of their knowledge of his\r\ndouble-dealing in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe means at the First Consul's disposal might have been considered\r\nsufficient to dispense with these paltry devices; for when the\r\nsquadrons of Brest, Lorient, Rochefort, and Toulon had joined their\r\nforces, they mustered thirty-two ships of the line and thirty-one\r\nfrigates, with more than 20,000 troops on board. So great, indeed, was\r\nthe force as to occasion strong remonstrances from the British\r\nGovernment, and a warning that a proportionately strong fleet would be\r\nsent to watch over the safety of our West Indies.[197] The size of the\r\nFrench armada and the warnings which Toussaint received from Europe\r\ninduced that wily dictator to adopt stringent precautionary measures.\r\nHe persuaded the blacks that the French were about to enslave them\r\nonce more, and, raising the spectre of bondage, he quelled sedition,\r\nravaged the maritime towns, and awaited the French in the interior, in\r\nconfident expectation that yellow fever would winnow their ranks and\r\nreduce them to a level with his own strength.\r\n\r\nHis hopes were ultimately realized, but not until he himself succumbed\r\nto the hardihood of the French attack. Leclerc's army swept across the\r\ndesolated belt with an ardour that was redoubled by the sight of the\r\nmangled remains of white people strewn amidst the negro encampments,\r\nand stormed Toussaint's chief stronghold at Crête-à-Pierrot. The\r\ndictator and his factious lieutenants thereupon surrendered (May 8th,\r\n1802), on condition of their official rank being respected--a\r\nstipulation which both sides must have regarded as unreal and\r\nimpossible. The French then pressed on to secure the subjection of the\r\nwhole island before the advent of the unhealthy season, which\r\nToussaint eagerly awaited. It now set in with unusual virulence; and\r\nin a few days the conquerors found their force reduced to 12,000\r\neffectives. Suspecting Toussaint's designs, Leclerc seized him. He was\r\nempowered to do so by Bonaparte's orders of March 16th, 1802:\r\n\r\n     \"Follow your instructions exactly, and as soon as you have done\r\n     with Toussaint, Christopher, Dessalines, and the chief brigands,\r\n     and the masses of the blacks are disarmed, send to the continent\r\n     all the blacks and the half-castes who have taken part in the civil\r\n     troubles.\"\r\n\r\nToussaint was hurried off to France, where he died a year later from\r\nthe hardships to which he was exposed at the fort of Joux among the\r\nJuras.\r\n\r\nLong before the cold of a French winter claimed the life of Toussaint,\r\nhis antagonist fell a victim to the sweltering heats of the tropics.\r\nOn November 2nd, 1802, Leclerc succumbed to the unhealthy climate and\r\nto his ceaseless anxieties. In the Notes dictated at St. Helena,\r\nNapoleon submitted Leclerc's memory to some strictures for his\r\nindiscretion in regard to the proposed restoration of slavery. The\r\nofficial letters of that officer expose the injustice of the charge.\r\nThe facts are these. After the seeming submission of St. Domingo, the\r\nFirst Consul caused a decree to be secretly passed at Paris (May 20th,\r\n1802), which prepared to re-establish slavery in the West Indies; but\r\nDecrès warned Leclerc that it was not for the present to be applied to\r\nSt. Domingo unless it seemed to be opportune. Knowing how fatal any\r\nsuch proclamation would be, Leclerc suppressed the decree; but General\r\nRichepanse, who was now governor of the island of Guadeloupe, not only\r\nissued the decree, but proceeded to enforce it with rigour. It was\r\nthis which caused the last and most desperate revolts of the blacks,\r\nfatal alike to French domination and to Leclerc's life. His successor,\r\nRochambeau, in spite of strong reinforcements of troops from France\r\nand a policy of the utmost rigour, succeeded no better. In the island\r\nof Guadeloupe the rebels openly defied the authority of France; and,\r\non the renewal of war between England and France, the remains of the\r\nexpedition were for the most part constrained to surrender to the\r\nBritish flag or to the insurgent blacks. The island recovered its\r\nso-called independence; and the sole result of Napoleon's efforts in\r\nthis sphere was the loss of more than twenty generals and some 30,000\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nThe assertion has been repeatedly made that the First Consul told off\r\nfor this service the troops of the Army of the Rhine, with the aim of\r\nexposing to the risks of tropical life the most republican part of the\r\nFrench forces. That these furnished a large part of the expeditionary\r\nforce cannot be denied; but if his design was to rid himself of\r\npolitical foes, it is difficult to see why he should not have selected\r\nMoreau, Masséna, or Augereau, rather than Leclerc. The fact that his\r\nbrother-in-law was accompanied by his wife, Pauline Bonaparte, for\r\nwhom venomous tongues asserted that Napoleon cherished a more than\r\nbrotherly affection, will suffice to refute the slander. Finally, it\r\nmay be remarked that Bonaparte had not hesitated to subject the\r\nchoicest part of his Army of Italy and his own special friends to\r\nsimiliar risks in Egypt and Syria. He never hesitated to sacrifice\r\nthousands of lives when a great object was at stake; and the\r\nrestoration of the French West Indian Colonies might well seem worth\r\nan army, especially as St. Domingo was not only of immense instrinsic\r\nvalue to France in days when beetroot sugar was unknown, but was of\r\nstrategic importance as a base of operations for the vast colonial\r\nempire which the First Consul proposed to rebuild in the basin of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe history of the French possessions on the North American continent\r\ncould scarcely be recalled by ardent patriots without pangs of\r\nremorse. The name Louisiana, applied to a vast territory stretching up\r\nthe banks of the Mississippi and the Missouri, recalled the glorious\r\ndays of Louis XIV., when the French flag was borne by stout\r\n_voyageurs_ up the foaming rivers of Canada and the placid reaches of\r\nthe father of rivers. It had been the ambition of Montcalm to connect\r\nthe French stations on Lake Erie with the forts of Louisiana; but that\r\nwarrior-statesman in the West, as his kindred spirit, Dupleix, in the\r\nEast, had fallen on the evil days of Louis XV., when valour and merit\r\nin the French colonies were sacrificed to the pleasures and parasites\r\nof Versailles. The natural result followed. Louisiana was yielded up\r\nto Spain in 1763, in order to reconcile the Court of Madrid to\r\ncessions required by that same Peace of Paris. Twenty years later\r\nSpain recovered from England the provinces of eastern and western\r\nFlorida; and thus, at the dawn of the nineteenth century, the red and\r\nyellow flag waved over all the lands between California, New Orleans,\r\nand the southern tip of Florida.[198]\r\n\r\nMany efforts were made by France to regain her old Mississippi\r\nprovince; and in 1795, at the break up of the First Coalition, the\r\nvictorious Republic pressed Spain to yield up this territory, where\r\nthe settlers were still French at heart. Doubtless the weak King of\r\nSpain would have yielded; but his chief Minister, Godoy, clung\r\ntenaciously to Louisiana, and consented to cede only the Spanish part\r\nof St. Domingo--a diplomatic success which helped to earn him the\r\ntitle of the Prince of the Peace. So matters remained until\r\nTalleyrand, as Foreign Minister, sought to gain Louisiana from Spain\r\nbefore it slipped into the horny fists of the Anglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\nThat there was every prospect of this last event was the conviction\r\nnot only of the politicians at Washington, but also of every\r\niron-worker on the Ohio and of every planter on the Tennessee. Those\r\nyoung but growing settlements chafed against the restraints imposed by\r\nSpain on the river trade of the lower Mississippi--the sole means\r\navailable for their exports in times when the Alleghanies were crossed\r\nby only two tracks worthy the name of roads. In 1795 they gained free\r\negress to the Gulf of Mexico and the right of bonding their\r\nmerchandise in a special warehouse at New Orleans. Thereafter the\r\nUnited States calmly awaited the time when racial vigour and the\r\nexigencies of commerce should yield to them the possession of the\r\nwestern prairies and the little townships of Arkansas and New Orleans.\r\nThey reckoned without taking count of the eager longing of the French\r\nfor their former colony and the determination of Napoleon to give\r\neffect to this honourable sentiment.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1800, when his negotiations with the United\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStates were in good train, the First Consul sent to Madrid\r\ninstructions empowering the French Minister there to arrange a treaty\r\nwhereby France should receive Louisiana in return for the cession of\r\nTuscany to the heir of the Duke of Parma. This young man had married\r\nthe daughter of Charles IV. of Spain; and, for the aggrandizement of\r\nhis son-in-law, that _roi fainéant_, was ready, nay eager, to bargain\r\naway a quarter of a continent; and he did so by a secret convention\r\nsigned at St. Ildefonso on October 7th, 1800.\r\n\r\nBut though Charles rejoiced over this exchange, Godoy, who was gifted\r\nwith some insight into the future, was determined to frustrate it.\r\nVarious events occurred which enabled this wily Minister, first to\r\ndelay, and then almost to prevent, the odious surrender. Chief among\r\nthese was the certainty that the transfer from weak hands to strong\r\nhands would be passionately resented by the United States; and until\r\npeace with England was fully assured, and the power of Toussaint\r\nbroken, it would be folly for the First Consul to risk a conflict with\r\nthe United States. That they would fight rather than see the western\r\nprairies pass into the First Consul's hands was abundantly manifest.\r\nIt is proved by many patriotic pamphlets. The most important of\r\nthese--\"An Address to the Government of the United States on the\r\nCession of Louisiana to the French,\" published at Philadelphia in\r\n1802--quoted largely from a French _brochure_ by a French Councillor\r\nof State. The French writer had stated that along the Mississippi his\r\ncountrymen would find boundless fertile prairies, and as for the\r\nopposition of the United States--\"a nation of pedlars and\r\nshopkeepers\"--that could be crushed by a French alliance with the\r\nIndian tribes. The American writer thereupon passionately called on\r\nhis fellow-citizens to prevent this transfer: \"France is to be dreaded\r\nonly, or chiefly, on the Mississippi. The Government must take\r\nLouisiana before it passes into her hands. The iron is now hot:\r\ncommand us to rise as one man and strike.\" These and other like\r\nprotests at last stirred the placid Government at Washington; and it\r\nbade the American Minister at Paris to make urgent remonstrances, the\r\nsole effect of which was to draw from Talleyrand the bland assurance\r\nthat the transfer had not been seriously contemplated.[199]\r\n\r\nBy the month of June, 1802, all circumstances seemed to smile on\r\nNapoleon's enterprise: England had ratified the Peace of Amiens,\r\nToussaint had delivered himself up to Leclerc: France had her troops\r\nstrongly posted in Tuscany and Parma, and could, if necessary,\r\nforcibly end the remaining scruples felt at Madrid; while the United\r\nStates, with a feeble army and a rotting navy, were controlled by the\r\nmost peaceable and Franco-phil of their presidents, Thomas Jefferson.\r\nThe First Consul accordingly ordered an expedition to be prepared, as\r\nif for the reinforcement of Leclerc in St. Domingo, though it was\r\nreally destined for New Orleans; and he instructed Talleyrand to\r\nsoothe or coerce the Court of Madrid into the final act of transfer.\r\nThe offer was therefore made by the latter (June 19th) in the name of\r\nthe First Consul that _in no case would Louisiana ever be alienated to\r\na Third Power_. When further delays supervened, Bonaparte, true to his\r\npolicy of continually raising his demands, required that Eastern and\r\nWestern Florida should also be ceded to him by Spain, on condition\r\nthat the young King of Etruria (for so Tuscany was now to be styled)\r\nshould regain his father's duchy of Parma.[200]\r\n\r\nA word of explanation must here find place as to this singular\r\nproposal. Parma had long been under French control; and, in March,\r\n1801, by the secret Treaty of Madrid, the ruler of that duchy, whose\r\ndeath seemed imminent, was to resign his claims thereto, provided that\r\nhis son should gain Etruria--as had been already provided for at St.\r\nIldefonso and Lunéville. The duke was, however, allowed to keep his\r\nduchy until his death, which occurred on October 9th, 1802; and it is\r\nstated by our envoy in Paris to have been hastened by news of that\r\nodious bargain.[201] His death now furnished Bonaparte with a good\r\noccasion for seeking to win an immense area in the New World at the\r\nexpense of a small Italian duchy, which his troops could at any time\r\neasily overrun. This consideration seems to have occurred even to\r\nCharles IV.; he refused to barter the Floridas against Parma. The\r\nre-establishment of his son-in-law in his paternal domains was\r\ndoubtless desirable, but not at the cost of so exacting a heriot as\r\nEast and West Florida.\r\n\r\nFrom out this maze of sordid intrigues two or three facts challenge\r\nour attention. Both Bonaparte and Charles IV. regarded the most\r\nfertile waste lands then calling for the plough as fairly exchanged\r\nagainst half a million of Tuscans; but the former feared the\r\nresentment of the United States, and sought to postpone a rupture\r\nuntil he could coerce them by overwhelming force. It is equally clear\r\nthat, had he succeeded in this enterprise, France might have gained a\r\ngreat colonial empire in North America protected from St. Domingo as a\r\nnaval and military base, while that island would have doubly prospered\r\nfrom the vast supplies poured down the Mississippi; but this success\r\nhe would have bought at the expense of a _rapprochement_ between the\r\nUnited States and their motherland, such as a bitter destiny was to\r\npostpone to the end of the century.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of an Anglo-American alliance might well give pause even\r\nto Napoleon. Nevertheless, he resolved to complete this vast\r\nenterprise, which, if successful, would have profoundly affected the\r\nNew World and the relative importance of the French and English\r\npeoples. The Spanish officials at New Orleans, in pursuance of orders\r\nfrom Madrid, now closed the lower Mississippi to vessels of the United\r\nStates (October, 1802). At once a furious outcry arose in the States\r\nagainst an act which not only violated their treaty rights, but\r\nforeshadowed the coming grip of the First Consul. For this outburst he\r\nwas prepared: General Victor was at Dunkirk, with five battalions and\r\nsixteen field-pieces, ready to cross the Atlantic, ostensibly for the\r\nrelief of Leclerc, but really in order to take possession of New\r\nOrleans.[202] But his plan was foiled by the sure instincts of the\r\nAmerican people, by the disasters of the St. Domingo expedition, and\r\nby the restlessness of England under his various provocations.\r\nJefferson, despite his predilections for France, was compelled to\r\nforbid the occupation of Louisiana: he accordingly sent Monroe to\r\nParis with instructions to effect a compromise, or even to buy\r\noutright the French claims on that land. Various circumstances\r\nfavoured this mission. In the first week of the year 1803 Napoleon\r\nreceived the news of Leclerc's death and the miserable state of the\r\nFrench in St. Domingo; and as the tidings that he now received from\r\nEgypt, Syria, Corfu, and the East generally, were of the most alluring\r\nkind, he tacitly abandoned his Mississippi enterprise in favour of the\r\noriental schemes which were closer to his heart. In that month of\r\nJanuary he seems to have turned his gaze from the western hemisphere\r\ntowards Turkey, Egypt, and India. True, he still seemed to be doing\r\nhis utmost for the occupation of Louisiana, but only as a device for\r\nsustaining the selling price of the western prairies.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of this change of policy reached the ears of Joseph and\r\nLucien Bonaparte, it aroused their bitterest opposition. Lucien plumed\r\nhimself on having struck the bargain with Spain which had secured that\r\nvast province at the expense of an Austrian archduke's crown; and\r\nJoseph knew only too well that Napoleon was freeing himself in the\r\nWest in order to be free to strike hard in Europe and the East. The\r\nimminent rupture of the Peace of Amiens touched him keenly: for that\r\npeace was his proudest achievement. If colonial adventures must be\r\nsought, let them be sought in the New World, where Spain and the\r\nUnited States could offer only a feeble resistance, rather than in\r\nEurope and Asia, where unending war must be the result of an\r\naggressive policy.\r\n\r\nAt once the brothers sought an interview with Napoleon. He chanced to\r\nbe in his bath, a warm bath perfumed with scents, where he believed\r\nthat tired nature most readily found recovery. He ordered them to be\r\nadmitted, and an interesting family discussion was the result. On his\r\nmentioning the proposed sale, Lucien at once retorted that the\r\nLegislature would never consent to this sacrifice. He there touched\r\nthe wrong chord in Napoleon's nature: had he appealed to the memories\r\nof _le grand monarque_ and of Montcalm, possibly he might have bent\r\nthat iron will; but the mention of the consent of the French deputies\r\nroused the spleen of the autocrat, who, from amidst the scented water,\r\nmockingly bade his brother go into mourning for the affair, which he,\r\nand he alone, intended to carry out. This gibe led Joseph to threaten\r\nthat he would mount the tribune in the Chambers and head the\r\nopposition to this unpatriotic surrender. Defiance flashed forth once\r\nmore from the bath; and the First Consul finally ended their bitter\r\nretorts by spasmodically rising as suddenly falling backwards, and\r\ndrenching Joseph to the skin. His peals of scornful laughter, and the\r\nswooning of the valet, who was not yet fully inured to these family\r\nscenes, interrupted the argument of the piece; but, when resumed a\r\nlittle later, _à sec_, Lucien wound up by declaring that, if he were\r\nnot his brother, he would be his enemy. \"My enemy! That is rather\r\nstrong,\" exclaimed Napoleon. \"You my enemy! I would break you, see,\r\nlike this box\"--and he dashed his snuff-box on the carpet. It did not\r\nbreak: but the portrait of Josephine was detached and broken.\r\nWhereupon Lucien picked up the pieces and handed them to his brother,\r\nremarking: \"It is a pity: meanwhile, until you can break me, it is\r\nyour wife's portrait that you have broken.\"[203]\r\n\r\nTo Talleyrand, Napoleon was equally unbending: summoning him on April\r\n11th, he said:\r\n\r\n     \"Irresolution and deliberation are no longer in season. I renounce\r\n     Louisiana. It is not only New Orleans that I cede: it is the whole\r\n     colony, without reserve; I know the price of what I abandon. I have\r\n     proved the importance I attach to this province, since my first\r\n     diplomatic act with Spain had the object of recovering it. I\r\n     renounce it with the greatest regret: to attempt obstinately to\r\n     retain it would be folly. I direct you to negotiate the\r\n     affair.\"[204]\r\n\r\nAfter some haggling with Monroe, the price agreed on for this\r\nterritory was 60,000,000 francs, the United States also covenanting to\r\nsatisfy the claims which many of their citizens had on the French\r\ntreasury. For this paltry sum the United States gained a peaceful\r\ntitle to the debatable lands west of Lake Erie and to the vast tracts\r\nwest of the Mississippi. The First Consul carried out his threat of\r\ndenying to the deputies of France any voice in this barter. The war\r\nwith England sufficed to distract their attention; and France turned\r\nsadly away from the western prairies, which her hardy sons had first\r\nopened up, to fix her gaze, first on the Orient, and thereafter on\r\nEuropean conquests. No more was heard of Louisiana, and few references\r\nwere permitted to the disasters in St. Domingo; for Napoleon abhorred\r\nany mention of a _coup manqué_, and strove to banish from the\r\nimagination of France those dreams of a trans-Atlantic Empire which\r\nhad drawn him, as they were destined sixty years later to draw his\r\nnephew, to the verge of war with the rising republic of the New World.\r\nIn one respect, the uncle was more fortunate than the nephew. In\r\nsigning the treaty with the United States, the First Consul could\r\nrepresent his conduct, not as a dexterous retreat from an impossible\r\nsituation, but as an act of grace to the Americans and a blow to\r\nEngland. \"This accession of territory,\" he said, \"strengthens for ever\r\nthe power of the United States, and I have just given to England a\r\nmaritime rival that sooner or later will humble her pride.\"[205]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the East there seemed to be scarcely the same field for expansion\r\nas in the western hemisphere. Yet, as the Orient had ever fired the\r\nimagination of Napoleon, he was eager to expand the possessions of\r\nFrance in the Indian Ocean. In October, 1801, these amounted to the\r\nIsle of Bourbon and the Isle of France; for the former French\r\npossessions in India, namely, Pondicherry, Mahé, Karikal,\r\nChandernagore, along with their factories at Yanaon, Surat, and two\r\nsmaller places, had been seized by the British, and were not to be\r\ngiven back to France until six months after the definitive treaty of\r\npeace was signed. From these scanty relics it seemed impossible to\r\nrear a stable fabric: yet the First Consul grappled with the task.\r\nAfter the cessation of hostilities, he ordered Admiral Gantheaume with\r\nfour ships of war to show the French flag in those seas, and to be\r\nready in due course to take over the French settlements in India.\r\nMeanwhile he used his utmost endeavours in the negotiations at Amiens\r\nto gain an accession of land for Pondicherry, such as would make it a\r\npossible base for military enterprise. Even before those negotiations\r\nbegan he expressed to Lord Cornwallis his desire for such an\r\nextension; and when the British plenipotentiary urged the cession of\r\nTobago to Great Britain, he offered to exchange it for an\r\nestablishment or territory in India.[206] Herein the First Consul\r\ncommitted a serious tactical blunder; for his insistence on this topic\r\nand his avowed desire to negotiate direct with the Nabob undoubtedly\r\naroused the suspicions of our Government.\r\n\r\nStill greater must have been their concern when they learnt that\r\nGeneral Decaen was commissioned to receive back the French possessions\r\nin India; for that general in 1800 had expressed to Bonaparte his\r\nhatred of the English, and had begged, even if he had to wait ten\r\nyears, that he might be sent where he could fight them, especially in\r\nIndia. As was his wont, Bonaparte said little at the time; but after\r\ntesting Decaen's military capacity, he called him to his side at\r\nmidsummer, 1802, and suddenly asked him if he still thought about\r\nIndia. On receiving an eager affirmative, he said, \"Well, you will\r\ngo.\" \"In what capacity?\" \"As captain-general: go to the Minister of\r\nMarine and of the Colonies and ask him to communicate to you the\r\ndocuments relating to this expedition.\" By such means did Bonaparte\r\nsecure devoted servants. It is scarcely needful to add that the choice\r\nof such a man only three months after the signature of the Treaty of\r\nAmiens proves that the First Consul only intended to keep that peace\r\nas long as his forward colonial policy rendered it desirable.[207]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile our Governor-General, Marquis Wellesley, was displaying an\r\nactivity which might seem to be dictated by knowledge of Bonaparte's\r\ndesigns. There was, indeed, every need of vigour. Nowhere had French\r\nand British interests been so constantly in collision as in India. In\r\n1798 France had intrigued with Tippoo Sahib at Seringapatam, and\r\narranged a treaty for the purpose of expelling the British nation from\r\nIndia. When in 1799 French hopes were dashed by Arthur Wellesley's\r\ncapture of that city and the death of Tippoo, there still remained\r\nsome prospect of overthrowing British supremacy by uniting the\r\nrestless Mahratta rulers of the north and centre, especially Scindiah\r\nand Holkar, in a powerful confederacy. For some years their armies,\r\nnumbering some 60,000 men, had been drilled and equipped by French\r\nadventurers, the ablest and most powerful of whom was M. Perron.\r\nDoubtless it was with the hope of gaining their support that the Czar\r\nPaul and Bonaparte had in 1800 formed the project of invading India by\r\nway of Persia. And after the dissipation of that dream, there still\r\nremained the chance of strengthening the Mahratta princes so as to\r\ncontest British claims with every hope of success. Forewarned by the\r\nhome Government of Bonaparte's eastern designs, our able and ambitious\r\nGovernor-General now prepared to isolate the Mahratta chieftains, to\r\ncut them off from all contact with France, and, if necessary, to\r\nshatter Scindiah's army, the only formidable native force drilled by\r\nEuropean methods.\r\n\r\nSuch was the position of affairs when General Decaen undertook the\r\nenterprise of revivifying French influences in India.\r\n\r\nThe secret instructions which he received from the First Consul, dated\r\nJanuary 15th, 1803, were the following:\r\n\r\n     \"To communicate with the peoples or princes who are most impatient\r\n     under the yoke of the English Company.... To send home a report six\r\n     months after his arrival in India, concerning all information that\r\n     he shall have collected, on the strength, the position, and the\r\n     feeling of the different peoples of India, as well as on the\r\n     strength and position of the different English establishments; ...\r\n     his views, and hopes that he might have of finding support, in case\r\n     of war, so as to be able to maintain himself in the Peninsula....\r\n     Finally, as one must reason on the hypothesis that we should not be\r\n     masters of the sea and could hope for slight succour,\"\r\n\r\nDecaen is to seek among the French possessions or elsewhere a place\r\nserving as a _point d'appui_, where in the last resort he could\r\ncapitulate and thus gain the means of being transported to France with\r\narms and baggage. Of this _point d'appui_ he will\r\n\r\n     \"strive to take possession after the first months ... whatever be\r\n     the nation to which it belongs, Portuguese, Dutch, or English....\r\n     If war should break out between England and France before the 1st\r\n     of Vendémiaire, Year XIII. (September 22nd, 1804), and the captain\r\n     general is warned of it before receiving the orders of the\r\n     Government, he has _carte blanche_ to fall back on the Ile de\r\n     France and the Cape, or to remain in India.... It is now considered\r\n     impossible that we should have war with England without dragging in\r\n     Holland. One of the first cares of the captain-general will be to\r\n     gain control over the Dutch, Portuguese, and Spanish\r\n     establishments, and of their resources. The captain-general's\r\n     mission is at first one of observation, on political and military\r\n     topics, with the small forces that he takes out, and an occupation\r\n     of _comptoirs_ for our commerce: but the First Consul, if well\r\n     informed by him, will perhaps be able some day to put him in a\r\n     position to acquire that great glory which hands down the memory of\r\n     men beyond the lapse of centuries.\"[208]\r\n\r\nHad these instructions been known to English statesmen, they would\r\ncertainly have ended the peace which was being thus perfidiously used\r\nby the First Consul for the destruction of our Indian Empire. But\r\nthough their suspicions were aroused by the departure of Decaen's\r\nexpedition and by the activity of French agents in India, yet the\r\ntruth remained half hidden, until, at a later date, the publication of\r\nGeneral Decaen's papers shed a flood of light on Napoleon's policy.\r\n\r\nOwing to various causes, the expedition did not set sail from Brest\r\nuntil the beginning of March, 1803. The date should be noticed. It\r\nproves that at this time Napoleon judged that a rupture of peace was\r\nnot imminent; and when he saw his miscalculation, he sought to delay\r\nthe war with England as long as possible in order to allow time for\r\nDecaen's force at least to reach the Cape, then in the hands of the\r\nDutch. The French squadron was too weak to risk a fight with an\r\nEnglish fleet; it comprised only four ships of war, two transports,\r\nand a few smaller vessels, carrying about 1,800 troops.[209] The ships\r\nwere under the command of Admiral Linois, who was destined to be the\r\nterror of our merchantmen in eastern seas. Decaen's first halt was at\r\nthe Cape, which had been given back by us to the Dutch East India\r\nCompany on February 21st, 1803. The French general found the Dutch\r\nofficials in their usual state of lethargy: the fortifications had not\r\nbeen repaired, and many of the inhabitants, and even of the officials\r\nthemselves, says Decaen, were devoted to the English. After surveying\r\nthe place, doubtless with a view to its occupation as the _point\r\nd'appui_ hinted at in his instructions, he set sail on the 27th of\r\nMay, and arrived before Pondicherry on the 11th of July.[210]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime important events had transpired which served to wreck\r\nnot only Decaen's enterprise, but the French influence in India. In\r\nEurope the flames of war had burst forth, a fact of which both Decaen\r\nand the British officials were ignorant; but the Governor of Fort St.\r\nGeorge (Madras), having, before the 15th of June, \"received\r\nintelligence which appeared to indicate the certainty of an early\r\nrenewal of hostilities between His Majesty and France,\" announced that\r\nhe must postpone the restitution of Pondicherry to the French, until\r\nhe should have the authority of the Governor-General for such\r\naction.[211]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Marquis Wellesley was still less disposed to any such restitution.\r\nFrench intervention in the affairs of Switzerland, which will be\r\ndescribed later on, had so embittered Anglo-French relations that on\r\nOctober the 17th, 1802, Lord Hobart, our Minister of War and for the\r\nColonies, despatched a \"most secret\" despatch, stating that recent\r\nevents rendered it necessary to postpone this retrocession. At a later\r\nperiod Wellesley received contrary orders, instructing him to restore\r\nFrench and Dutch territories; but he judged that step to be\r\ninopportune considering the gravity of events in the north of India.\r\nSo active was the French propaganda at the Mahratta Courts, and so\r\nthreatening were their armed preparations, that he redoubled his\r\nefforts for the consolidation of British supremacy. He resolved to\r\nstrike at Scindiah, unless he withdrew his southern army into his own\r\nterritories; and, on receiving an evasive answer from that prince, who\r\nhoped by temporizing to gain armed succours from France, he launched\r\nthe British forces against him. Now was the opportunity for Arthur\r\nWellesley to display his prowess against the finest forces of the\r\nEast; and brilliantly did the young warrior display it. The victories\r\nof Assaye in September, and of Argaum in November, scattered the\r\nsouthern Mahratta force, but only after desperate conflicts that\r\nsuggested how easily a couple of Decaen's battalions might have turned\r\nthe scales of war.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the north, General Lake stormed Aligarh, and drove\r\nScindiah's troops back to Delhi. Disgusted at the incapacity and\r\nperfidy that surrounded him, Perron threw up his command; and another\r\nconflict near Delhi yielded that ancient seat of Empire to our trading\r\nCompany. In three months the results of the toil of Scindiah, the\r\nrestless ambition of Holkar, the training of European officers, and the\r\nsecret intrigues of Napoleon, were all swept to the winds. Wellesley now\r\nannexed the land around Delhi and Agra, besides certain coast districts\r\nwhich cut off the Mahrattas from the sea, also stipulating for the\r\ncomplete exclusion of French agents from their States. Perron was\r\nallowed to return to France; and the brusque reception accorded him from\r\nBonaparte may serve to measure the height of the First Consul's hopes,\r\nthe depth of his disappointment, and his resentment against a man who\r\nwas daunted by a single disaster.[212]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it was the lot of Decaen to witness, in inglorious\r\ninactivity, the overthrow of all his hopes. Indeed, he barely escaped\r\nthe capture which Wellesley designed for his whole force, as soon as\r\nhe should hear of the outbreak of war in Europe; but by secret and\r\nskilful measures all the French ships, except one transport, escaped\r\nto their appointed rendezvous, the Ile de France. Enraged by these\r\nevents, Decaen and Linois determined to inflict every possible injury\r\non their foes. The latter soon swept from the eastern seas British\r\nmerchantmen valued at a million sterling, while the general ceased not\r\nto send emissaries into India to encourage the millions of natives to\r\nshake off the yoke of \"a few thousand English.\"\r\n\r\nThese officers effected little, and some of them were handed over to\r\nthe English authorities by the now obsequious potentates. Decaen also\r\nendeavoured to carry out the First Consul's design of occupying\r\nstrategic points in the Indian Ocean. In the autumn of 1803 he sent a\r\nfine cruiser to the Imaum of Muscat, to induce him to cede a station\r\nfor commercial purposes at that port. But Wellesley, forewarned by our\r\nagent at Bagdad, had made a firm alliance with the Imaum, who\r\naccordingly refused the request of the French captain. The incident,\r\nhowever, supplies another link in the chain of evidence as to the\r\ncompleteness of Napoleon's oriental policy, and yields another proof\r\nof the vigour of our great proconsul at Calcutta, by whose foresight\r\nour Indian Empire was preserved and strengthened.[213]\r\n\r\nBonaparte's enterprises were by no means limited to well-known lands.\r\nThe unknown continent of the Southern Seas appealed to his\r\nimagination, which pictured its solitudes transformed by French energy\r\ninto a second fatherland. Australia, or New Holland, as it was then\r\ncalled, had long attracted the notice of French explorers, but the\r\nEnglish penal settlements at and near Sydney formed the only European\r\nestablishment on the great southern island at the dawn of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nBonaparte early turned his eyes towards that land. On his voyage to\r\nEgypt he took with him the volumes in which Captain Cook described his\r\nfamous discoveries; and no sooner was he firmly installed as First\r\nConsul than he planned with the Institute of France a great French\r\nexpedition to New Holland. The full text of the plan has never been\r\npublished: probably it was suppressed or destroyed; and the sole\r\npublic record relating to it is contained in the official account of\r\nthe expedition published at the French Imperial Press in 1807.[214]\r\nAccording to this description, the aim was solely geographical and\r\nscientific. The First Consul and the Institute of France desired that\r\nthe ships should proceed to Van Diemen's Land, explore its rivers, and\r\nthen complete the survey of the south coast of the continent, so as to\r\nsee whether behind the islands of the Nuyts Archipelago there might be\r\na channel connecting with the Gulf of Carpentaria, and so cutting New\r\nHolland in half. They were then to sail west to \"Terre Leeuwin,\"\r\nascend the Swan River, complete the exploration of Shark's Bay and the\r\nnorth-western coasts, and winter in Timor or Amboyne. Finally, they\r\nwere to coast along New Guinea and the Gulf of Carpentaria, and return\r\nto France in 1803.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1800, the ships, having on board twenty-three scientific\r\nmen, set sail from Havre under the command of Commodore Baudin. They\r\nreceived no molestation from English cruisers, it being a rule of\r\nhonour to give Admiralty permits to all members of genuinely\r\nscientific and geographical parties. Nevertheless, even on its\r\nscientific side, this splendidly-equipped expedition produced no\r\nresults comparable with those achieved by Lieutenant Bass or by\r\nCaptain Flinders. The French ships touched at the Ile de France, and\r\nsailed thence for Van Diemen's Land. After spending a long time in the\r\nexploration of its coasts and in collecting scientific information,\r\nthey made for Sydney in order to repair their ships and gain relief\r\nfor their many invalids. Thence, after incidents which will be noticed\r\npresently, they set sail in November, 1802, for Bass Strait and the\r\ncoast beyond. They seem to have overlooked the entrance to Port\r\nPhillip--a discovery effected by Murray in 1801, but not made public\r\ntill three years later--and failed to notice the outlet of the chief\r\nAustralian river, which is obscured by a shallow lake.\r\n\r\nThere they were met by Captain Flinders, who, on H.M.S.\r\n\"Investigator,\" had been exploring the coast between Cape Leeuwin and\r\nthe great gulfs which he named after Lords St. Vincent and Spencer.\r\nFlinders was returning towards Sydney, when, in the long desolate\r\ncurve of the bay which he named from the incident Encounter Bay, he\r\nsaw the French ships. After brief and guarded intercourse the\r\nexplorers separated, the French proceeding to survey the gulfs whence\r\nthe \"Investigator\" had just sailed; while Flinders, after a short stay\r\nat Sydney and the exploration of the northern coast and Torres Strait,\r\nset out for Europe.[215]\r\n\r\nApart from the compilation of the most accurate map of Australia which\r\nhad then appeared, and the naming of several features on its\r\ncoasts--_e.g._, Capes Berrouilli and Gantheaume, the Bays of Rivoli\r\nand of Lacépède, and the Freycinet Peninsula, which are still\r\nretained--the French expedition achieved no geographical results of\r\nthe first importance.\r\n\r\nIts political aims now claim attention. A glance at the accompanying\r\nmap will show that, under the guise of being an emissary of\r\ncivilization, Commodore Baudin was prepared to claim half the\r\ncontinent for France. Indeed, his final inquiry at Sydney about the\r\nextent of the British claims on the Pacific coast was so significant\r\nas to elicit from Governor King the reply that the whole of Van\r\nDiemen's Land and of the coast from Cape Howe on the south of the\r\nmainland to Cape York on the north was British territory. King also\r\nnotified the suspicious action of the French Commander to the Home\r\nGovernment; and when the French sailed away to explore the coast of\r\nsouthern and central Australia he sent a ship to watch their\r\nproceedings. When, therefore, Commodore Baudin effected a landing on\r\nKing Island, the Union Jack was speedily hoisted and saluted by the\r\nblue-jackets of the British vessel; for it was rumoured that French\r\nofficers had said that King Island would afford a good station for the\r\ncommand of Bass Strait and the seizure of British ships. This was\r\nprobably mere gossip. Baudin in his interviews with Governor King at\r\nSydney disclaimed any intention of seizing Van Diemen's Land; but he\r\nafterwards stated that _he did not know what were the plans of the\r\nFrench Government with regard to that island_.[216]\r\n\r\nLong before this dark saying could be known at Westminster, the\r\nsuspicions of our Government had been aroused; and, on February 13th,\r\n1803, Lord Hobart penned a despatch to Governor King bidding him to\r\ntake every precaution against French annexations, and to form\r\nsettlements in Van Diemen's Land and at Port Phillip. The station of\r\nRisden was accordingly planted on the estuary of the Derwent, a little\r\nabove the present town of Hobart; while on the shores of Port Phillip\r\nanother expedition sent out from the mother country sought, but for\r\nthe present in vain, to find a suitable site. The French cruise\r\ntherefore exerted on the fortunes of the English and French peoples an\r\ninfluence such as has frequently accrued from their colonial rivalry:\r\nit spurred on the island Power to more vigorous efforts than she would\r\notherwise have put forth, and led to the discomfiture of her\r\ncontinental rival. The plans of Napoleon for the acquisition of Van\r\nDiemen's Land and the middle of Australia had an effect like that\r\nwhich the ambition of Montcalm, Dupleix, Lally, and Perron has exerted\r\non the ultimate destiny of many a vast and fertile territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, in spite of the destruction of his fleet at Trafalgar, Napoleon\r\nheld to his Australian plans. No fact, perhaps, is more suggestive of\r\nthe dogged tenacity of his will than his order to Péron and Freycinet\r\nto publish through the Imperial Press at Paris an exhaustive account\r\nof their Australian voyage, accompanied by maps which claimed half of\r\nthat continent for the tricolour flag. It appeared in 1807, the year\r\nof Tilsit and of the plans for the partition of Portugal and her\r\ncolonies between France and Spain. The hour seemed at last to have\r\nstruck for the assertion of French supremacy in other continents, now\r\nthat the Franco-Russian alliance had durably consolidated it in\r\nEurope. And who shall say that, but for the Spanish Rising and the\r\ngenius of Wellington, a vast colonial empire might not have been won\r\nfor France, had Napoleon been free to divert his energies away from\r\nthis \"old Europe\" of which he professed to be utterly weary?\r\n\r\nHis whole attitude towards European and colonial politics revealed a\r\nstatesmanlike appreciation of the forces that were to mould the\r\nfortunes of nations in the nineteenth century. He saw that no\r\nrearrangement of the European peoples could be permanent. They were\r\ntoo stubborn, too solidly nationalized, to bear the yoke of the new\r\nCharlemagne. \"I am come too late,\" he once exclaimed to Marmont; \"men\r\nare too enlightened, there is nothing great left to be done.\" These\r\nwords reveal his sense of the artificiality of his European conquests.\r\nHis imperial instincts could find complete satisfaction only among the\r\ndocile fate-ridden peoples of Asia, where he might unite the functions\r\nof an Alexander and a Mahomet: or, failing that, he would carve out an\r\nempire from the vast southern lands, organizing them by his unresting\r\npowers and ruling them as oekist and as despot. This task would possess\r\na permanence such as man's conquests over Nature may always enjoy, and\r\nhis triumphs over his fellows seldom or never. The political\r\nreconstruction of Europe was at best one of an infinite number of such\r\nchanges, always progressing and never completed; while the peopling of\r\nnew lands and the founding of States belonged to that highest plane of\r\npolitical achievement wherein schemes of social beneficence and the\r\ndictates of a boundless ambition could maintain an eager and unending\r\nrivalry. While a strictly European policy could effect little more\r\nthan a raking over of long-cultivated parterres, the foundation of a\r\nnew colonial empire would be the turning up of the virgin soil of the\r\nlimitless prairie.\r\n\r\nIf we inquire by the light of history why these grand designs failed,\r\nthe answer must be that they were too vast fitly to consort with an\r\nambitious European policy. His ablest adviser noted this fundamental\r\ndefect as rapidly developing after the Peace of Amiens, when \"he began\r\nto sow the seeds of new wars which, after overwhelming Europe and\r\nFrance, were to lead him to his ruin.\" This criticism of Talleyrand on\r\na man far greater than himself, but who lacked that saving grace of\r\nmoderation in which the diplomatist excelled, is consonant with all\r\nthe teachings of history. The fortunes of the colonial empires of\r\nAthens and Carthage in the ancient world, of the Italian maritime\r\nrepublics, of Portugal and Spain, and, above all, the failure of the\r\nprojects of Louis XIV. and Louis XV. serve to prove that only as the\r\nmotherland enjoys a sufficiency of peace at home and on her borders\r\ncan she send forth in ceaseless flow those supplies of men and\r\ntreasure which are the very life-blood of a new organism. That\r\nbeneficent stream might have poured into Napoleon's Colonial Empire,\r\nhad not other claims diverted it into the barren channels of European\r\nwarfare. The same result followed as at the time of the Seven Years'\r\nWar, when the double effort to wage great campaigns in Germany and\r\nacross the oceans sapped the strength of France, and the additions won\r\nby Dupleix and Montcalm fell away from her flaccid frame.\r\n\r\nDid Napoleon foresee a similar result? His conduct in regard to\r\nLouisiana and in reference to Decaen's expedition proves that he did,\r\nbut only when it was too late. As soon as he saw that his policy was\r\nabout to provoke another war with Britain long before he was ready for\r\nit, he decided to forego his oceanic schemes and to concentrate his\r\nforces on his European frontiers. The decision was dictated by a true\r\nsense of imperial strategy. But what shall we say of his sense of\r\nimperial diplomacy? The foregoing narrative and the events to be\r\ndescribed in the next chapters prove that his mistake lay in that\r\noverweening belief in his own powers and in the pliability of his\r\nenemies which was the cause of his grandest triumphs and of his\r\nunexampled overthrow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON'S INTERVENTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nWar, said St. Augustine, is but the transition from a lower to a\r\nhigher state of peace. The saying is certainly true for those wars\r\nthat are waged in defence of some great principle or righteous cause.\r\nIt may perhaps be applied with justice to the early struggles of the\r\nFrench revolutionists to secure their democratic Government against\r\nthe threatened intervention of monarchical States. But the danger of\r\nvindicating the cause of freedom by armed force has never been more\r\nglaringly shown than in the struggles of that volcanic age. When\r\ndemocracy had gained a sure foothold in the European system, the war\r\nwas still pushed on by the triumphant republicans at the expense of\r\nneighbouring States, so that, even before the advent of Bonaparte,\r\ntheir polity was being strangely warped by the influence of military\r\nmethods of rule. The brilliance of the triumphs won by that young\r\nwarrior speedily became the greatest danger of republican France; and\r\nas the extraordinary energy developed in her people by recent events\r\ncast her feeble neighbours to the ground, Europe cowered away before\r\nthe ever-increasing bulk of France. In their struggles after democracy\r\nthe French finally reverted to the military type of Government, which\r\naccords with many of the cherished instincts of their race: and the\r\nmilitary-democratic compromise embodied in Napoleon endowed that\r\npeople with the twofold force of national pride and of conscious\r\nstrength springing from their new institutions.\r\n\r\nWith this was mingled contempt for neighbouring peoples who either\r\ncould not or would not gain a similar independence and prestige.\r\nEverything helped to feed this self-confidence and contempt for\r\nothers. The venerable fabric of the Holy Roman Empire was rocking to\r\nand fro amidst the spoliations of its ecclesiastical lands by lay\r\nprinces, in which its former champions, the Houses of Hapsburg and\r\nHohenzollern, were the most exacting of the claimants. The Czar, in\r\nOctober, 1801, had come to a profitable understanding with France\r\nconcerning these \"secularizations.\" A little later France and Russia\r\nbegan to draw together on the Eastern Question in a way threatening to\r\nTurkey and to British influence in the Levant.[217] In fact, French\r\ndiplomacy used the partition of the German ecclesiastical lands and\r\nthe threatened collapse of the Ottoman power as a potent means of\r\nbusying the Continental States and leaving Great Britain isolated.\r\nMoreover, the great island State was passing through ministerial and\r\nfinancial difficulties which robbed her of all the fruits of her naval\r\ntriumphs and made her diplomacy at Amiens the laughing-stock of the\r\nworld. When monarchical ideas were thus discredited, it was idle to\r\nexpect peace. The struggling upwards towards a higher plane had indeed\r\nbegun; democracy had effected a lodgment in Western Europe; but the\r\nold order in its bewildered gropings after some sure basis had not yet\r\ntouched bottom on that rock of nationality which was to yield a new\r\nfoundation for monarchy amidst the strifes of the nineteenth century.\r\nOnly when the monarchs received the support of their French-hating\r\nsubjects could an equilibrium of force and of enthusiasms yield the\r\nlong-sought opportunity for a durable peace.[218]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe negotiations at Amiens had amply shown the great difficulty of the\r\nreadjustment of European affairs. If our Ministers had manifested\r\ntheir real feelings about Napoleon's presidency of the Italian\r\nRepublic, war would certainly have broken forth. But, as has been\r\nseen, they preferred to assume the attitude of the ostrich, the worst\r\npossible device both for the welfare of Europe and the interests of\r\nGreat Britain; for it convinced Napoleon that he could safely venture\r\non other interventions; and this he proceeded to do in the affairs of\r\nItaly, Holland, and Switzerland.\r\n\r\nOn September 21st, 1802, appeared a _senatus consultum_ ordering the\r\nincorporation of Piedmont in France. This important territory,\r\nlessened by the annexation of its eastern parts to the Italian\r\nRepublic, had for five months been provisionally administered by a\r\nFrench general as a military district of France. Its definite\r\nincorporation in the great Republic now put an end to all hopes of\r\nrestoration of the House of Savoy. For the King of Sardinia, now an\r\nexile in his island, the British Ministry had made some efforts at\r\nAmiens; but, as it knew that the Czar and the First Consul had agreed\r\non offering him some suitable indemnity, the hope was cherished that\r\nthe new sovereign, Victor Emmanuel I., would be restored to his\r\nmainland possessions. That hope was now at an end. In vain did Lord\r\nWhitworth, our ambassador at Paris, seek to help the Russian envoy to\r\ngain a fit indemnity. Sienna and its lands were named, as if in\r\nderision; and though George III. and the Czar ceased not to press the\r\nclaims of the House of Savoy, yet no more tempting offer came from\r\nParis, except a hint that some part of European Turkey might be found\r\nfor him; and the young ruler nobly refused to barter for the petty\r\nSiennese, or for some Turkish pachalic, his birthright to the lands\r\nwhich, under a happier Victor Emmanuel, were to form the nucleus of a\r\nUnited Italy.[219] A month after the absorption of Piedmont came the\r\nannexation of Parma. The heir to that duchy, who was son-in-law to the\r\nKing of Spain, had been raised to the dignity of King of Etruria; and\r\nin return for this aggrandizement in Europe, Charles IV. bartered away\r\nto France the whole of Louisiana. Nevertheless, the First Consul kept\r\nhis troops in Parma, and on the death of the old duke in October,\r\n1802, Parma and its dependencies were incorporated in the French\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nThe naval supremacy of France in the Mediterranean was also secured by\r\nthe annexation of the Isle of Elba with its excellent harbour of Porto\r\nFerrajo. Three deputies from Elba came to Paris to pay their respects\r\nto their new ruler. The Minister of War was thereupon charged to treat\r\nthem with every courtesy, to entertain them at dinner, to give them\r\n3,000 francs apiece, and to hint that on their presentation to\r\nBonaparte they might make a short speech expressing the pleasure of\r\ntheir people at being united with France. By such deft rehearsals did\r\nthis master in the art of scenic displays weld Elba on to France and\r\nFrance to himself.\r\n\r\nEven more important was Bonaparte's intervention in Switzerland. The\r\ncondition of that land calls for some explanation. For wellnigh three\r\ncenturies the Switzers had been grouped in thirteen cantons, which\r\ndiffered widely in character and constitution. The Central or Forest\r\nCantons still retained the old Teutonic custom of regulating their\r\naffairs in their several folk-moots, at which every householder\r\nappeared fully armed. Elsewhere the confederation had developed less\r\nadmirable customs, and the richer lowlands especially were under the\r\nhereditary control of rich burgher families. There was no constitution\r\nbinding these States in any effective union. Each of the cantons\r\nclaimed a governmental sovereignty that was scarcely impaired by the\r\ndeliberations of the Federal Diet. Besides these sovereign States were\r\nothers that held an ill-defined position as allies; among these were\r\nGeneva, Basel, Bienne, Saint Gall, the old imperial city of Mühlhausen\r\nin Alsace, the three Grisons, the principality of Neufchâtel, and\r\nValais on the Upper Rhone. Last came the subject-lands, Aargau,\r\nThurgau, Ticino, Vaud, and others, which were governed in various\r\ndegrees of strictness by their cantonal overlords. Such was the old\r\nSwiss Confederacy: it somewhat resembled that chaotic Macedonian\r\nleague of mountain clans, plain-dwellers, and cities, which was so\r\nprofoundly influenced by the infiltration of Greek ideas and by the\r\nmasterful genius of Philip. Switzerland was likewise to be shaken by a\r\nnew political influence, and thereafter to be controlled by the\r\ngreatest statesman of the age.\r\n\r\nOn this motley group of cantons and districts the French Revolution\r\nexerted a powerful influence; and when, in 1798, the people of Vaud\r\nstrove to throw off the yoke of Berne, French troops, on the\r\ninvitation of the insurgents, invaded Switzerland, quelled the brave\r\nresistance of the central cantons, and ransacked the chief of the\r\nSwiss treasuries. After the plunderers came the constitution-mongers,\r\nwho forthwith forced on Switzerland democracy of the most French and\r\ngeometrical type: all differences between the sovereign cantons,\r\nallies, and subject-lands were swept away, and Helvetia was\r\nconstituted as an indivisible republic--except Valais, which was to be\r\nindependent, and Geneva and Mühlhausen, which were absorbed by France.\r\nThe subject districts and non-privileged classes benefited\r\nconsiderably by the social reforms introduced under French influence;\r\nbut a constitution recklessly transferred from Paris to Berne could\r\nonly provoke loathing among a people that never before had submitted\r\nto foreign dictation. Moreover, the new order of things violated the\r\nmost elementary needs of the Swiss, whose racial and religious\r\ninstincts claimed freedom of action for each district or canton.\r\n\r\nOf these deep-seated feelings the oligarchs of the plains, no less\r\nthan the democrats of the Forest Cantons, were now the champions;\r\nwhile the partisans of the new-fangled democracy were held up to scorn\r\nas the supporters of a cast-iron centralization. It soon became clear\r\nthat the constitution of 1798 could be perpetuated only by the support\r\nof the French troops quartered on that unhappy land; for throughout\r\nthe years 1800 and 1801 the political see-saw tilted every few months,\r\nfirst in favour of the oligarchic or federal party, then again towards\r\ntheir unionist opponents. After the Peace of Lunéville, which\r\nrecognized the right of the Swiss to adopt what form of government\r\nthey thought fit, some of their deputies travelled to Paris with the\r\ndraft of a constitution lately drawn up by the Chamber at Berne, in\r\nthe hope of gaining the assent of the First Consul to its provisions\r\nand the withdrawal of French troops. They had every reason for hope:\r\nthe party then in power at Berne was that which favoured a centralized\r\ndemocracy, and their plenipotentiary in Paris, a thorough republican\r\nnamed Stapfer, had been led to hope that Switzerland would now be\r\nallowed to carve out its own destiny. What, then, was his surprise to\r\nfind the First Consul increasingly enamoured of federalism. The\r\nletters written by Stapfer to the Swiss Government at this time are\r\nhighly instructive.[220]\r\n\r\nOn March 10th, 1801, he wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"What torments us most is the cruel uncertainty as to the real aims\r\n     of the French Government. Does it want to federalize us in order to\r\n     weaken us and to rule more surely by our divisions: or does it\r\n     really desire our independence and welfare, and is its delay only\r\n     the result of its doubts as to the true wishes of the Helvetic\r\n     nation?\"\r\n\r\nStapfer soon found that the real cause of delay was the non-completion\r\nof the cession of Valais, which Bonaparte urgently desired for the\r\nconstruction of a military road across the Simplon Pass; and as the\r\nSwiss refused this demand, matters remained at a standstill. \"The\r\nwhole of Europe would not make him give up a favourite scheme,\" wrote\r\nStapfer on April 10th; \"the possession of Valais is one of the matters\r\nclosest to his heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe protracted pressure of a French army of occupation on that already\r\nimpoverished land proved irresistible; and some important\r\nmodifications of the Swiss project of a constitution, on which the\r\nFirst Consul insisted, were inserted in the new federal compact of\r\nMay, 1801. Switzerland was now divided into seventeen cantons; and\r\ndespite the wish of the official Swiss envoys for a strongly\r\ncentralized government, Bonaparte gave large powers to the cantonal\r\nauthorities. His motives in this course of action have been variously\r\njudged. In giving greater freedom of movement to the several cantons,\r\nhe certainly adopted the only statesmanlike course: but his conduct\r\nduring the negotiation, his retention of Valais, and the continued\r\noccupation of Switzerland by his troops, albeit in reduced numbers,\r\ncaused many doubts as to the sincerity of his desire for a final\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nThe unionist majority at Berne soon proceeded to modify his proposals,\r\nwhich they condemned as full of defects and contradictions; while the\r\nfederals strove to keep matters as they were. In the month of October\r\ntheir efforts succeeded, thanks to the support of the French\r\nambassador and soldiery; they dissolved the Assembly, annulled its\r\nrecent amendments; and their influence procured for Reding, the head\r\nof the oligarchic party, the office of Landamman, or supreme\r\nmagistrate. So reactionary, however, were their proceedings, that the\r\nFirst Consul recalled the French general as a sign of his displeasure\r\nat his help recently offered to the federals. Their triumph was brief:\r\nwhile their chiefs were away at Easter, 1802, the democratic unionists\r\neffected another _coup d'état_--it was the fourth--and promulgated one\r\nmore constitution. This change seems also to have been brought about\r\nwith the connivance of the French authorities:[221] their refusal to\r\nlisten to Stapfer's claims for a definite settlement, as well as their\r\npersistent hints that the Swiss could not by themselves arrange their\r\nown affairs, argued a desire to continue the epoch of quarterly _coups\r\nd'état_.\r\n\r\nThe victory of the so-called democrats at Berne now brought the whole\r\nmatter to the touch. They appealed to the people in the first Swiss\r\n_plébiscite_, the precursor of the famous _referendum_. It could now\r\nbe decided without the interference of French troops; for the First\r\nConsul had privately declared to the new Landamman, Dolder, that he\r\nleft it to his Government to decide whether the foreign soldiery\r\nshould remain as a support or should evacuate Switzerland.[222] After\r\nmany searchings of heart, the new authorities decided to try their\r\nfortunes alone--a response which must have been expected at Paris,\r\nwhere Stapfer had for months been urging the removal of the French\r\nforces. For the first time since the year 1798 Switzerland was\r\ntherefore free to declare her will. The result of the _plébiscite_ was\r\ndecisive enough, 72,453 votes being cast in favour of the latest\r\nconstitution, and 92,423 against it. Nothing daunted by this rebuff,\r\nand, adopting a device which the First Consul had invented for the\r\nbenefit of Dutch liberty, the Bernese leaders declared that the\r\n167,172 adult voters who had not voted at all must reckon as approving\r\nthe new order of things. The flimsiness of this pretext was soon\r\ndisclosed. The Swiss had had enough of electioneering tricks,\r\nhole-and-corner revolutions, and paper compacts. They rushed to arms;\r\nand if ever Carlyle's appeal away from ballot-boxes and parliamentary\r\ntongue-fencers to the primæval _mights of man_ can be justified, it\r\nwas in the sharp and decisive conflicts of the early autumn of 1802 in\r\nSwitzerland. The troops of the central authorities, marching forth\r\nfrom Berne to quell the rising ferment, sustained a repulse at the\r\nfoot of Mont Pilatus, as also before the walls of Zürich; and, the\r\nrevolt of the federals ever gathering force, the Helvetic authorities\r\nwere driven from Berne to Lausanne. There they were planning flight\r\nacross the Lake of Geneva to Savoy, when, on October 15th, the arrival\r\nof Napoleon's aide-de-camp, General Rapp, with an imperious\r\nproclamation dismayed the federals and promised to the discomfited\r\nunionists the mediation of the First Consul for which they had humbly\r\npleaded.[223]\r\n\r\nNapoleon had apparently viewed the late proceedings in Switzerland\r\nwith mingled feelings of irritation and amused contempt. \"Well, there\r\nyou are once more in a Revolution\" was his hasty comment to Stapfer at\r\na diplomatic reception shortly after Easter; \"try and get tired of all\r\nthat.\" It is difficult, however, to believe that so keen-sighted a\r\nstatesman could look forward to anything but commotions for a land\r\nthat was being saddled with an impracticable constitution, and whence\r\nthe controlling French forces were withdrawn at that very crisis. He\r\nwas certainly prepared for the events of September: many times he had\r\nquizzingly asked Stapfer how the constitution was faring, and he must\r\nhave received with quiet amusement the solemn reply that there could\r\nbe no doubt as to its brilliant success. When the truth flashed\r\non Stapfer he was dumbfoundered, especially as Talleyrand at first\r\nmockingly repulsed any suggestion of the need of French mediation, and\r\nwent on to assure him that his master had neither counselled nor\r\napproved the last constitution, the unfitness of which was now shown\r\nby the widespread insurrection. Two days later, however, Napoleon\r\naltered his tone and directed Talleyrand vigorously to protest against\r\nthe acts and proclamations of the victorious federals as \"the most\r\nviolent outrage to French honour.\" On the last day of September he\r\nissued a proclamation to the Swiss declaring that he now revoked his\r\ndecision not to mingle in Swiss politics, and ordered the federal\r\nauthorities and troops to disperse, and the cantons to send deputies\r\nto Paris for the regulation of their affairs under his mediation.\r\nMeanwhile he bade the Swiss live once more in hope: their land was on\r\nthe brink of a precipice, but it would soon be saved! Rapp carried\r\nanalogous orders to Lausanne and Berne, while Ney marched in with a\r\nlarge force of French troops that had been assembled near the Swiss\r\nfrontiers.\r\n\r\nSo glaring a violation of Swiss independence and of the guaranteeing\r\nTreaty of Lunéville aroused indignation throughout Europe. But Austria\r\nwas too alarmed at Prussian aggrandizement in Germany to offer any\r\nprotest; and, indeed, procured some trifling gains by giving France a\r\nfree hand in Switzerland.[224] The Court of Berlin, then content to\r\nplay the jackal to the French lion, revealed to the First Consul the\r\nappeals for help privately made to Prussia by the Swiss federals:[225]\r\nthe Czar, influenced doubtless by his compact with France concerning\r\nGerman affairs, and by the advice of his former tutor, the Swiss\r\nLaharpe, offered no encouragement; and it was left to Great Britain to\r\nmake the sole effort then attempted for the cause of Swiss\r\nindependence. For some time past the cantons had made appeals to\r\nthe British Government, which now, in response, sent an English agent,\r\nMoore, to confer with their chiefs, and to advance money and promise\r\nactive support if he judged that a successful resistance could be\r\nattempted.[226] The British Ministry undoubtedly prepared for an open\r\nrupture with France on this question. Orders were immediately sent\r\nfrom London that no more French or Dutch colonies were to be handed\r\nback; and, as we have seen, the Cape of Good Hope and the French\r\nsettlements in India were refused to the Dutch and French officers who\r\nclaimed their surrender.\r\n\r\nHostilities, however, were for the present avoided. In face of the\r\noverwhelming force which Ney had close at hand, the chiefs of the\r\ncentral cantons shrank from any active opposition; and Moore, finding\r\non his arrival at Constance that they had decided to submit, speedily\r\nreturned to England. Ministers beheld with anger and dismay the\r\nperpetuation of French supremacy in that land; but they lacked the\r\ncourage openly to oppose the First Consul's action, and gave orders\r\nthat the stipulated cessions of French and Dutch colonies should take\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThe submission of the Swiss and the weakness of all the Powers\r\nencouraged the First Consul to impose his will on the deputies from\r\nthe cantons, who assembled at Paris at the close of the year 1802. He\r\nfirst caused their aims and the capacity of their leaders to be\r\nsounded in a Franco-Swiss Commission, and thereafter assembled them at\r\nSt. Cloud on Sunday, December 12th. He harangued them at great length,\r\nhinting very clearly that the Swiss must now take a far lower place in\r\nthe scale of peoples than in the days when France was divided into\r\nsixty fiefs, and that union with her could alone enable them to play a\r\ngreat part in the world's affairs: nevertheless, as they clung to\r\nindependence he would undertake in his quality of mediator to end\r\ntheir troubles, and yet leave them free. That they could attain unity\r\nwas a mere dream of their metaphysicians: they must rely on the\r\ncantonal organization, always provided that the French and Italian\r\ndistricts of Vaud and the upper Ticino were not subject to the central\r\nor German cantons: to prevent such a dishonour he would shed the blood\r\nof 50,000 Frenchmen: Berne must also open its golden book of the\r\nprivileged families to include four times their number. For the rest,\r\nthe Continental Powers could not help them, and England had \"no right\r\nto meddle in Swiss affairs.\" The same menace was repeated in more\r\nstrident tones on January 29th:\r\n\r\n     \"I tell you that I would sacrifice 100,000 men rather than allow\r\n     England to meddle in your affairs: if the Cabinet of St. James\r\n     uttered a single word for you, it would be all up with you, I would\r\n     unite you to France: if that Court made the least insinuation of\r\n     its fears that I would be your Landamman, I would make myself your\r\n     Landamman.\"\r\n\r\nThere spake forth the inner mind of the man who, whether as child,\r\nyouth, lieutenant, general, Consul, or Emperor, loved to bear down\r\nopposition.[227]\r\n\r\nIn those days of superhuman activity, when he was carving out one\r\ncolonial Empire in the New World and preparing to found another in\r\nIndia, when he was outwitting the Cardinals, rearranging the map of\r\nGermany, breathing new life into French commerce and striving to\r\nshackle that of Britain, he yet found time to utter some of the sagest\r\nmaxims as to the widely different needs of the Swiss cantons. He\r\nassured the deputies that he spoke as a Corsican and a mountaineer,\r\nwho knew and loved the clan system. His words proved it. With sure\r\ntouch he sketched the characteristics of the French and Swiss people.\r\nSwitzerland needed the local freedom imparted by her cantons: while\r\nFrance required unity, Switzerland needed federalism: the French\r\nrejected this last as damaging their power and glory; but the Swiss\r\ndid not ask for glory; they needed \"political tranquillity and\r\nobscurity\": moreover, a simple pastoral people must have extensive\r\nlocal rights, which formed their chief distraction from the monotony\r\nof life: democracy was a necessity for the forest cantons; but let not\r\nthe aristocrats of the towns fear that a wider franchise would end\r\ntheir influence, for a people dependent on pastoral pursuits would\r\nalways cling to great families rather than to electoral assemblies:\r\nlet these be elected on a fairly wide basis. Then again, what ready\r\nwit flashed forth in his retort to a deputy who objected to the\r\nBernese Oberland forming part of the Canton of Berne: \"Where do you\r\ntake your cattle and your cheese?\"--\"To Berne.\"--\"Whence do you get\r\nyour grain, cloth, and iron?\"--\"From Berne.\"--\"Very well: 'To Berne,\r\nfrom Berne'--you consequently belong to Berne.\" The reply is a good\r\ninstance of that canny materialism which he so victoriously opposed to\r\nfeudal chaos and monarchical ineptitude.\r\n\r\nIndeed, in matters great as well as small his genius pierced to the\r\nheart of a problem: he saw that the democratic unionists had failed\r\nfrom the rigidity of their centralization, while the federals had\r\ngiven offence by insufficiently recognizing the new passion for social\r\nequality.[228] He now prepared to federalize Switzerland on a\r\nmoderately democratic basis; for a policy of balance, he himself being\r\nat the middle of the see-saw, was obviously required by good sense as\r\nwell as by self-interest. Witness his words to Roederer on this\r\nsubject:\r\n\r\n\"While satisfying the generality, I cause the patricians to tremble.\r\nIn giving to these last the appearance of power, I oblige them to take\r\nrefuge at my side in order to find protection. I let the people\r\nthreaten the aristocrats, so that these may have need of me. I will\r\ngive them places and distinctions, but they will hold them from me.\r\nThis system of mine has succeeded in France. See the clergy. Every day\r\nthey will become, in spite of themselves, more devoted to my\r\ngovernment than they had foreseen.\"\r\n\r\nHow simple and yet how subtle is this statecraft; simplicity of aim,\r\nwith subtlety in the choice of means: this is the secret of his\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nAfter much preliminary work done by French commissioners and the Swiss\r\ndeputies in committee, the First Consul summed up the results of their\r\nlabours in the Act of Mediation of February 19th, 1803, which\r\nconstituted the Confederation in nineteen cantons, the formerly\r\nsubject districts now attaining cantonal dignity and privileges. The\r\nforest cantons kept their ancient folk-moots, while the town cantons\r\nsuch as Berne, Zürich, and Basel were suffered to blend their old\r\ninstitutions with democratic customs, greatly to the chagrin of the\r\nunionists, at whose invitation Bonaparte had taken up the work of\r\nmediation.\r\n\r\nThe federal compact was also a compromise between the old and the new.\r\nThe nineteen cantons were to enjoy sovereign powers under the shelter\r\nof the old federal pact. Bonaparte saw that the fussy imposition of\r\nFrench governmental forms in 1798 had wrought infinite harm, and he\r\nnow granted to the federal authorities merely the powers necessary for\r\nself-defence: the federal forces were to consist of 15,200 men--a\r\nnumber less than that which by old treaty Switzerland had to furnish\r\nto France. The central power was vested in a Landamman and other\r\nofficers appointed yearly by one of the six chief cantons taken in\r\nrotation; and a Federal Diet, consisting of twenty-five deputies--one\r\nfrom each of the small cantons, and two from each of the six larger\r\ncantons--met to discuss matters of general import, but the balance of\r\npower rested with the cantons: further articles regulated the Helvetic\r\ndebt and declared the independence of Switzerland--as if a land could\r\nbe independent which furnished more troops to the foreigner than it\r\nwas allowed to maintain for its own defence. Furthermore, the Act\r\nbreathed not a word about religious liberty, freedom of the Press, or\r\nthe right of petition: and, viewing it as a whole, the friends of\r\nfreedom had cause to echo the complaint of Stapfer that \"the First\r\nConsul's aim was to annul Switzerland politically, but to assure to\r\nthe Swiss the greatest possible domestic happiness.\"\r\n\r\nI have judged it advisable to give an account of Franco-Swiss\r\nrelations on a scale proportionate to their interest and importance;\r\nthey exhibit, not only the meanness and folly of the French Directory,\r\nbut the genius of the great Corsican in skilfully blending the new and\r\nthe old, and in his rejection of the fussy pedantry of French\r\ntheorists and the worst prejudices of the Swiss oligarchs. Had not his\r\nsage designs been intertwined with subtle intrigues which assured his\r\nown unquestioned supremacy in that land, the Act of Mediation might be\r\nreckoned among the grandest and most beneficent achievements. As it\r\nis, it must be regarded as a masterpiece of able but selfish\r\nstatecraft, which contrasts unfavourably with the disinterested\r\narrangements sanctioned by the allies for Switzerland in 1815.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE RENEWAL OF WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe re-occupation of Switzerland by the French in October, 1802, was\r\nsoon followed by other serious events, which convinced the British\r\nMinistry that war was hardly to be avoided. Indeed, before the treaty\r\nwas ratified, ominous complaints had begun to pass between Paris and\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nSome of these were trivial, others were highly important. Among the\r\nlatter was the question of commercial intercourse. The British\r\nMinistry had neglected to obtain any written assurance that trade\r\nrelations should be resumed between the two countries; and the First\r\nConsul, either prompted by the protectionist theories of the Jacobins,\r\nor because he wished to exert pressure upon England in order to extort\r\nfurther concessions, determined to restrict trade with us to the\r\nsmallest possible dimensions. This treatment of England was wholly\r\nexceptional, for in his treaties concluded with Russia, Portugal, and\r\nthe Porte, Napoleon had procured the insertion of clauses which\r\ndirectly fostered French trade with those lands. Remonstrances soon\r\ncame from the British Government that \"strict prohibitions were being\r\nenforced to the admission of British commodities and manufactures into\r\nFrance, and very vigorous restrictions were imposed on British vessels\r\nentering French ports\"; but, in spite of all representations, we had\r\nthe mortification of seeing the hardware of Birmingham, and the\r\never-increasing stores of cotton and woollen goods, shut out from\r\nFrance and her subject-lands, as well as from the French colonies\r\nwhich we had just handed back.\r\n\r\nIn this policy of commercial prohibition Napoleon was confirmed by our\r\nrefusal to expel the Bourbon princes. He declined to accept our\r\nexplanation that they were not officially recognized, and could not be\r\nexpelled from England without a violation of the rights of\r\nhospitality; and he bitterly complained of the personal attacks made\r\nupon him in journals published in London by the French _émigrés_. Of\r\nthese the most acrid, namely, those of Peltier's paper, \"L'Ambigu,\"\r\nhad already received the reprobation of the British Ministry; but, as\r\nhad been previously explained at Amiens, the Addington Cabinet decided\r\nthat it could not venture to curtail the liberty of the Press, least\r\nof all at the dictation of the very man who was answering the pop-guns\r\nof our unofficial journals by double-shotted retorts in the official\r\n\"Moniteur.\" Of these last His Majesty did not deign to make any\r\nformal complaint; but he suggested that their insertion in the organ\r\nof the French Government should have prevented Napoleon from\r\npreferring the present protests.\r\n\r\nThis wordy war proceeded with unabated vigour on both sides of the\r\nChannel, the British journals complaining of the Napoleonic\r\ndictatorship in Continental affairs, while the \"Moniteur\" bristled\r\nwith articles whose short, sharp sentences could come only from the\r\nFirst Consul. The official Press hitherto had been characterized by\r\ndull decorum, and great was the surprise of the older Courts when the\r\nFrench official journals compared the policy of the Court of St. James\r\nwith the methods of the Barbary rovers and the designs of the Miltonic\r\nSatan.[229] Nevertheless, our Ministry prosecuted and convicted\r\nPeltier for libel, an act which, at the time, produced an excellent\r\nimpression at Paris.[230]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut more serious matters were now at hand. Newspaper articles and\r\ncommercial restrictions were not the cause of war, however much they\r\nirritated the two peoples.\r\n\r\nThe general position of Anglo-French affairs in the autumn of 1802 is\r\nwell described in the official instructions given to Lord Whitworth\r\nwhen he was about to proceed as ambassador to Paris. For this\r\ndifficult duty he had several good qualifications. During his embassy\r\nat St. Petersburg he had shown a combination of tact and firmness\r\nwhich imposed respect, and doubtless his composure under the violent\r\noutbreaks of the Czar Paul furnished a recommendation for the equally\r\ntrying post at Paris, which he filled with a _sang froid_ that has\r\nbecome historic. Possibly a more genial personality might have\r\nsmoothed over some difficulties at the Tuileries: but the Addington\r\nMinistry, having tried geniality in the person of Cornwallis,\r\nnaturally selected a man who was remarkable for his powers of quiet\r\nyet firm resistance.\r\n\r\nHis first instructions of September 10th, 1802, are such as might be\r\ndrawn up between any two Powers entering on a long term of peace. But\r\nthe series of untoward events noticed above overclouded the political\r\nhorizon; and the change finds significant expression in the secret\r\ninstructions of November 14th. He is now charged to state George\r\nIII.'s determination \"never to forego his right of interfering in the\r\naffairs of the Continent on any occasion in which the interests of his\r\nown dominions or those of Europe in general may appear to him to\r\nrequire it.\" A French despatch is then quoted, as admitting that, for\r\nevery considerable gain of France on the Continent, Great Britain had\r\nsome claim to compensation: and such a claim, it was hinted, might now\r\nbe proffered after the annexation of Piedmont and Parma. Against the\r\ncontinued occupation of Holland by French troops and their invasion of\r\nSwitzerland, Whitworth was to make moderate but firm remonstrances,\r\nbut in such a way as not to commit us finally. He was to employ an\r\nequal discretion with regard to Malta. As Russia and Prussia had as\r\nyet declined to guarantee the arrangements for that island's\r\nindependence, it was evident that the British troops could not yet be\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\n     \"His Majesty would certainly be justified in claiming the\r\n     possession of Malta, as some counterpoise to the acquisitions of\r\n     France, since the conclusion of the definitive treaty: but it is\r\n     not necessary to decide now whether His Majesty will be disposed to\r\n     avail himself of his pretensions in this respect.\"\r\n\r\nThus between September 10th and November 14th we passed from a\r\ndistinctly pacific to a bellicose attitude, and all but formed the\r\ndecision to demand Malta as a compensation for the recent\r\naggrandizements of France. To have declared war at once on these\r\ngrounds would certainly have been more dignified. But, as our Ministry\r\nhad already given way on many topics, a sudden declaration of war on\r\nSwiss and Italian affairs would have stultified its complaisant\r\nconduct on weightier subjects. Moreover, the whole drift of\r\neighteenth-century diplomacy, no less than Bonaparte's own admission,\r\nwarranted the hope of securing Malta by way of \"compensation.\" The\r\nadroit bargainer, who was putting up German Church lands for sale, who\r\nhad gained Louisiana by the Parma-Tuscany exchange, and still\r\nprofessed to the Czar his good intentions as to an \"indemnity\" for the\r\nKing of Sardinia, might well be expected to admit the principle of\r\ncompensation in Anglo-French relations when these were being\r\njeopardized by French aggrandizement; and, as will shortly appear, the\r\nFirst Consul, while professing to champion international law against\r\nperfidious Albion, privately admitted her right to compensation, and\r\nonly demurred to its practical application when his oriental designs\r\nwere thereby compromised.\r\n\r\nBefore Whitworth proceeded to Paris, sharp remonstrances had been\r\nexchanged between the French and British Governments. To our protests\r\nagainst Napoleon's interventions in neighbouring States, he retorted\r\nby demanding \"the whole Treaty of Amiens and nothing but that treaty.\"\r\nWhereupon Hawkesbury answered: \"The state of the Continent at the\r\nperiod of the Treaty of Amiens, and nothing but that state.\" In reply\r\nNapoleon sent off a counterblast, alleging that French troops had\r\nevacuated Taranto, that Switzerland had requested his mediation, that\r\nGerman affairs possessed no novelty, and that England, having six\r\nmonths previously waived her interest in continental affairs, could\r\nnot resume it at will. The retort, which has called forth the\r\nadmiration of M. Thiers, is more specious than convincing.\r\nHawkesbury's appeal was, not to the sword, but to law; not to French\r\ninfluence gained by military occupations that contravened the Treaty\r\nof Lunéville, but to international equity.\r\n\r\nCertainly, the Addington Cabinet committed a grievous blunder in not\r\ninserting in the Treaty of Amiens a clause stipulating the\r\nindependence of the Batavian and Helvetic Republics. Doubtless it\r\nrelied on the Treaty of Lunéville, and on a Franco-Dutch convention of\r\nAugust, 1801, which specified that French troops were to remain in the\r\nBatavian Republic only up to the time of the general peace. But it is\r\none thing to rely on international law, and quite another thing, in an\r\nage of violence and chicanery, to hazard the gravest material\r\ninterests on its observance. Yet this was what the Addington Ministry\r\nhad done: \"His Majesty consented to make numerous and most important\r\nrestitutions to the Batavian Government on the consideration of that\r\nGovernment being independent and not being subject to any foreign\r\ncontrol.\"[231] Truly, the restoration of the Cape of Good Hope and of\r\nother colonies to the Dutch, solely in reliance on the observance of\r\ninternational law by Napoleon and Talleyrand, was, as the event\r\nproved, an act of singular credulity. But, looking at this matter\r\nfairly and squarely, it must be allowed that Napoleon's reply evaded\r\nthe essence of the British complaint; it was merely an _argumentum ad\r\nhominem_; it convicted the Addington Cabinet of weakness and\r\nimprovidence; but in equity it was null and void, and in practical\r\npolitics it betokened war.\r\n\r\nAs Napoleon refused to withdraw his troops from Holland, and continued\r\nto dominate that unhappy realm, it was clear that the Cape of Good\r\nHope would speedily be closed to our ships--a prospect which immensely\r\nenhanced the value of the overland route to India, and of those\r\nportals of the Orient, Malta and Egypt. To the Maltese Question we now\r\nturn, as also, later on, to the Eastern Question, with which it was\r\nthen closely connected.\r\n\r\nMany causes excited the uneasiness of the British Government\r\nabout the fate of Malta. In spite of our effort not to wound the\r\nsusceptibilities of the Czar, who was protector of the Order of St.\r\nJohn, that sensitive young ruler had taken umbrage at the article\r\nrelating to that island. He now appeared merely as one of the six\r\nPowers guaranteeing its independence, not as the sole patron and\r\nguarantor, and he was piqued at his name appearing after that of the\r\nEmperor Francis![232] For the present arrangement the First Consul was\r\nchiefly to blame; but the Czar vented his displeasure on England. On\r\nApril 28th, 1802, our envoy at Paris, Mr. Merry, reported as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Either the Russian Government itself, or Count Markoff alone\r\n     personally, is so completely out of humour with us for not having\r\n     acted in strict concert with them, or him, or in conformity to\r\n     their ideas in negotiating the definitive treaty [of Amiens], that\r\n     I find he takes pains to turn it into ridicule, and particularly to\r\n     represent the arrangement we have made for Malta as impracticable\r\n     and consequently as completely null.\"\r\n\r\nThe despatches of our ambassador at St. Petersburg, Lord St. Helens,\r\nand of his successor, Admiral Warren, are of the same tenor. They\r\nreport the Czar's annoyance with England over the Maltese affair, and\r\nhis refusal to listen even to the joint Anglo-French request,\r\nof November 18th, 1802, for his guarantee of the Amiens\r\narrangements.[233] A week later Alexander announced that he would\r\nguarantee the independence of Malta, provided that the complete\r\nsovereignty of the Knights of St. John was recognized--that is,\r\nwithout any participation of the native Maltese in the affairs of that\r\nOrder--and that the island should be garrisoned by Neapolitan troops,\r\npaid by France and England, until the Knights should be able to\r\nmaintain their independence. This reopening of the question discussed,\r\n_ad nauseam_, at Amiens proved that the Maltese Question would long\r\ncontinue to perplex the world. The matter was still further\r\ncomplicated by the abolition of the Priories, Commanderies, and\r\nproperty of the Order of St. John by the French Government in the\r\nspring of 1802--an example which was imitated by the Court of Madrid\r\nin the following autumn; and as the property of the Knights in the\r\nFrench part of Italy had also lapsed, it was difficult to see how the\r\nscattered and impoverished Knights could form a stable government,\r\nespecially if the native Maltese were not to be admitted to a share in\r\npublic affairs. This action of France, Spain, and Russia fully\r\nwarranted the British Government in not admitting into the fortress\r\nthe 2,000 Neapolitan troops that arrived in the autumn of 1802. Our\r\nevacuation of Malta was conditioned by several stipulations, five of\r\nwhich had not been fulfilled.[234] But the difficulties arising out of\r\nthe reconstruction of this moribund Order were as nothing when\r\ncompared with those resulting from the reopening of a far vaster and\r\nmore complex question--the \"eternal\" Eastern Question.\r\n\r\nRarely has the mouldering away of the Turkish Empire gone on so\r\nrapidly as at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Corruption and\r\nfavouritism paralyzed the Government at Constantinople; masterful\r\npachas, aping the tactics of Ali Pacha, the virtual ruler of Albania,\r\nwere beginning to carve out satrapies in Syria, Asia Minor, Wallachia,\r\nand even in Roumelia itself. Such was the state of Turkey when the\r\nSultan and his advisers heard with deep concern, in October, 1801,\r\nthat the only Power on whose friendship they could firmly rely was\r\nabout to relinquish Malta. At once he sent an earnest appeal to George\r\nIII. begging him not to evacuate the island. This despatch is not in\r\nthe archives of our Foreign Office; but the letter written from Malta\r\nby Lord Elgin, our ambassador at Constantinople, on his return home,\r\nsufficiently shows that the Sultan was conscious of his own weakness\r\nand of the schemes of partition which were being concocted at Paris.\r\nBonaparte had already begun to sound both Austria and Russia on this\r\nsubject, deftly hinting that the Power which did not early join in the\r\nenterprise would come poorly off. For the present both the rulers\r\nrejected his overtures; but he ceased not to hope that the anarchy in\r\nTurkey, and the jealousy which partition schemes always arouse among\r\nneighbours, would draw first one and then the other into his\r\nenterprise.[235]\r\n\r\nThe young Czar's disposition was at that period restless and unstable,\r\nfree from the passionate caprices of his ill-fated father, and attuned\r\nby the fond efforts of the Swiss democrat Laharpe, to the loftiest\r\naspirations of the France of 1789. Yet the son of Paul I. could hardly\r\nfree himself from the instincts of a line of conquering Czars; his\r\nfrank blue eyes, his graceful yet commanding figure, his high broad\r\nforehead and close shut mouth gave promise of mental energy; and his\r\nsplendid physique and love of martial display seemed to invite him to\r\ncomplete the campaigns of Catherine II. against the Turks, and to wash\r\nout in the waves of the Danube the remorse which he still felt at his\r\nunwitting complicity in a parricidal plot. Between his love of liberty\r\nand of foreign conquest he for the present wavered, with a strange\r\nconstitutional indecision that marred a noble character and that\r\nyielded him a prey more than once to a masterful will or to seductive\r\nprojects. He is the Janus of Russian history. On the one side he faces\r\nthe enormous problems of social and political reform, and yet he\r\nsteals many a longing glance towards the dome of St. Sofia. This\r\ninstability in his nature has been thus pointedly criticised by his\r\nfriend Prince Czartoryski:[236]\r\n\r\n     \"Grand ideas of the general good, generous sentiments, and the\r\n     desire to sacrifice to them a part of the imperial authority, had\r\n     really occupied the Emperor's mind, but they were rather a young\r\n     man's fancies than a grown man's decided will. The Emperor liked\r\n     forms of liberty, as he liked the theatre: it gave him pleasure and\r\n     flattered his vanity to see the appearances of free government in\r\n     his Empire: but all he wanted in this respect was forms and\r\n     appearances: he did not expect them to become realities. He would\r\n     willingly have agreed that every man should be free, on the\r\n     condition that he should voluntarily do only what the Emperor\r\n     wished.\"\r\n\r\nThis later judgment of the well-known Polish nationalist is probably\r\nembittered by the disappointments which he experienced at the Czar's\r\nhands; but it expresses the feeling of most observers of Alexander's\r\nearly career, and it corresponds with the conclusion arrived at by\r\nNapoleon's favourite aide-de-camp, Duroc, who went to congratulate the\r\nyoung Czar on his accession and to entice him into oriental\r\nschemes--that there was nothing to hope and nothing to fear from the\r\nCzar. The _mot_ was deeply true.[237]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom these oriental schemes the young Czar was, for the time, drawn\r\naside towards the nobler path of social reform. The saving influence\r\non this occasion was exerted by his old tutor, Laharpe. The\r\nex-Director of Switzerland readily persuaded the Czar that Russia\r\nsorely needed political and social reform. His influence was\r\npowerfully aided by a brilliant group of young men, the Vorontzoffs,\r\nthe Strogonoffs, Novossiltzoff, and Czartoryski, whose admiration for\r\nwestern ideas and institutions, especially those of Britain, helped to\r\nimpel Alexander on the path of progress. Thus, when Napoleon was\r\nplying the Czar with notes respecting Turkey, that young ruler was\r\ncommencing to bestow system on his administration, privileges on the\r\nserfs, and the feeble beginnings of education on the people.\r\n\r\nWhile immersed in these beneficent designs, Alexander heard with deep\r\nchagrin of the annexation of Piedmont and Parma, and that Napoleon\r\nrefused to the King of Sardinia any larger territory than the\r\nSiennese. This breach of good faith cut the Czar to the quick. It was\r\nin vain that Napoleon now sought to lure him into Turkish adventures\r\nby representing that France should secure the Morea for herself, that\r\nother parts of European Turkey might be apportioned to Victor Emmanuel\r\nI. and the French Bourbons. This cold-blooded proposal, that ancient\r\ndynasties should be thrust from the homes of their birth into alien\r\nGreek or Moslem lands, wounded the Czar's monarchical sentiments. He\r\nwould none of it; nor did he relish the prospect of seeing the French\r\nin the Morea, whence they could complete the disorder of Turkey and\r\nseize on Constantinople. He saw whither Napoleon was leading him. He\r\ndrew back abruptly, and even notified to our ambassador, Admiral\r\nWarren, that _England had better keep Malta._[238]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander also, on January 19th, 1803 (O.S.), charged his ambassador\r\nat Paris to declare that the existing system of Europe must not be\r\nfurther disturbed, that each Government should strive for peace and\r\nthe welfare of its own people; that the frequent references of\r\nNapoleon to the approaching dissolution of Turkey were ill-received at\r\nSt. Petersburg, where they were considered the chief cause of\r\nEngland's anxiety and refusal to disarm. He also suggested that the\r\nFirst Consul by some public utterance should dispel the fears of\r\nEngland as to a partition of the Ottoman Empire, and thus assure the\r\npeace of the world.[239]\r\n\r\nBefore this excellent advice was received, Napoleon astonished the\r\nworld by a daring stroke. On the 30th of January the \"Moniteur\"\r\nprinted in full the bellicose report of Colonel Sebastiani on his\r\nmission to Algiers, Egypt, Syria, and the Ionian Isles. As that\r\nmission was afterwards to be passed off as merely of a commercial\r\ncharacter, it will be well to quote typical passages from the secret\r\ninstructions which the First Consul gave to his envoy on September\r\n5th, 1802:\r\n\r\n     \"He will proceed to Alexandria: he will take note of what is in the\r\n     harbour, the ships, the forces which the British as well as the\r\n     Turks have there, the state of the fortifications, the state of the\r\n     towers, the account of all that has passed since our departure both\r\n     at Alexandria and in the whole of Egypt: finally, the present state\r\n     of the Egyptians.... He will proceed to St. Jean d'Acre, will\r\n     recommend the convent of Nazareth to Djezzar: will inform him that\r\n     the agent of the [French] Republic is to appear at Acre: will find\r\n     out about the fortifications he has had made: will walk along them\r\n     himself, if there be no danger.\"\r\n\r\nFortifications, troops, ships of war, the feelings of the natives, and\r\nthe protection of the Christians--these subjects were to be\r\nSebastiani's sole care. Commerce was not once named. The departure of\r\nthis officer had already alarmed our Government. Mr. Merry, our\r\n_chargé d'affaires_ in Paris, had warned it as to the real aims in\r\nview, in the following \"secret despatch:\r\n\r\n     \"PARIS, _September 25th,_ 1802.\r\n\r\n      \"... I have learnt from good authority that he [Sebastiani] was\r\n     accompanied by a person of the name of Jaubert (who was General\r\n     Bonaparte's interpreter and confidential agent with the natives\r\n     during the time he commanded in Egypt), who has carried with him\r\n     regular powers and instructions, prepared by M. Talleyrand, to\r\n     treat with Ibrahim-Bey for the purpose of creating a fresh and\r\n     successful revolt in Egypt against the power of the Porte, and of\r\n     placing that country again under the direct or indirect dependence\r\n     of France, to which end he has been authorized to offer assistance\r\n     from hence in men and money. The person who has confided to me this\r\n     information understands that the mission to Ibrahim-Bey is confided\r\n     solely to M. Jaubert, and that his being sent with Colonel\r\n     Sebastiani has been in order to conceal the real object of it, and\r\n     to afford him a safe conveyance to Egypt, as well as for the\r\n     purpose of assisting the Colonel in his transactions with the\r\n     Regencies of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli.\"[240]\r\n\r\nMerry's information was correct: it tallied with the secret\r\ninstructions given by Napoleon to Sebastiani: and our Government, thus\r\nforewarned, at once adopted a stiffer tone on all Mediterranean and\r\noriental questions. Sebastiani was very coldly received by our officer\r\ncommanding in Egypt, General Stuart, who informed him that no orders\r\nhad as yet come from London for our evacuation of that land.\r\nProceeding to Cairo, the commercial emissary proposed to mediate\r\nbetween the Turkish Pacha and the rebellious Mamelukes, an offer which\r\nwas firmly declined.[241] In vain did Sebastiani bluster and cajole by\r\nturns. The Pacha refused to allow him to go on to Assouan, the\r\nheadquarters of the insurgent Bey, and the discomfited envoy made his\r\nway back to the coast and took ship for Acre. Thence he set sail for\r\nCorfu, where he assured the people of Napoleon's wish that there\r\nshould be an end to their civil discords. Returning to Genoa, and\r\nposting with all speed to Paris, he arrived there on January 25th,\r\n1803. Five days later that gay capital was startled by the report of\r\nhis mission, which was printed in full in the \"Moniteur.\" It described\r\nthe wretched state of the Turks in Egypt--the Pacha of Cairo\r\npractically powerless, and on bad terms with General Stuart, the\r\nfortifications everywhere in a ruinous state, the 4,430 British troops\r\ncantoned in and near Alexandria, the Turkish forces beneath contempt.\r\n\"Six thousand French would at present be enough to conquer Egypt.\" And\r\nas to the Ionian islands, \"I do not stray from the truth in assuring\r\nyou that these islands will declare themselves French as soon as an\r\nopportunity shall offer itself.\"[242]\r\n\r\nSuch were the chief items of this report. Various motives have been\r\nassigned for its publication. Some writers have seen in it a crushing\r\nretort to English newspaper articles. Others there are, as M. Thiers,\r\nwho waver between the opinion that the publication of this report was\r\neither a \"sudden unfortunate incident,\" or a protest against the\r\n\"latitude\" which England allowed herself in the execution of the\r\nTreaty of Amiens.\r\n\r\n\r\nA consideration of the actual state of affairs at the end of January,\r\n1803, will perhaps guide us to an explanation which is more consonant\r\nwith the grandeur of Napoleon's designs. At that time he was\r\nall-powerful in the Old World. As First Consul for Life he was master\r\nof forty millions of men: he was President of the Italian Republic: to\r\nthe Switzers, as to the Dutch, his word was law. Against the\r\ninfractions of the Treaty of Lunéville, Austria dared make no protest.\r\nThe Czar was occupied with domestic affairs, and his rebuff to\r\nNapoleon's oriental schemes had not yet reached Paris. As for the\r\nBritish Ministry, it was trembling from the attacks of the Grenvilles\r\nand Windhams on the one side, and from the equally vigorous onslaughts\r\nof Fox, who, when the Government proposed an addition to the armed\r\nforces, brought forward the stale platitude that a large standing army\r\n\"was a dangerous instrument of influence in the hands of the Crown.\"\r\nWhen England's greatest orator thus impaired the unity of national\r\nfeeling, and her only statesman, Pitt, remained in studied seclusion,\r\nthe First Consul might well feel assured of the impotence of the\r\nIsland Power, and view the bickering of her politicians with the same\r\nquiet contempt that Philip felt for the Athens of Demosthenes.\r\n\r\nBut while his prospects in Europe and the East were roseate, the\r\nwestern horizon bulked threateningly with clouds. The news of the\r\ndisasters in St. Domingo reached Paris in the first week of the year\r\n1803, and shortly afterwards came tidings of the ferment in the United\r\nStates and the determination of their people to resist the acquisition\r\nof Louisiana by France. If he persevered with this last scheme, he\r\nwould provoke war with that republic and drive it into the arms of\r\nEngland. From that blunder his statecraft instinctively saved him, and\r\nhe determined to sell Louisiana to the United States.\r\n\r\nSo unheroic a retreat from the prairies of the New World must be\r\ncovered by a demonstration towards the banks of the Nile and of the\r\nIndus. It was ever his plan to cover retreat in one direction by\r\nbrilliant diversions in another: only so could he enthrall the\r\nimagination of France, and keep his hold on her restless capital. And\r\nthe publication of Sebastiani's report, with its glowing description\r\nof the fondness cherished for France alike by Moslems, Syrian\r\nChristians, and the Greeks of Corfu; its declamation against the\r\nperfidy of General Stuart; and its incitation to the conquest of the\r\nLevant, furnished him with the motive power for effecting a telling\r\ntransformation scene and banishing all thoughts of losses in the\r\nWest.[243]\r\n\r\nThe official publication of this report created a sensation even in\r\nFrance, and was not the _bagatelle_ which M. Thiers has endeavoured to\r\nrepresent it.[244] But far greater was the astonishment at Downing\r\nStreet, not at the facts disclosed by the report--for Merry's note\r\nhad prepared our Ministers for them--but rather at the official avowal\r\nof hostile designs. At once our Government warned Whitworth that he\r\nmust insist on our retaining Malta. He was also to protest against the\r\npublication of such a document, and to declare that George III. could\r\nnot \"enter into any further discussion relative to Malta until he\r\nreceived a satisfactory explanation.\" Far from offering it, Napoleon\r\nat once complained of our non-evacuation of Alexandria and Malta.\r\n\r\n     \"Instead of that garrison [of Alexandria] being a means of\r\n     protecting Egypt, it was only furnishing him with a pretence\r\n     for invading it. This he should not do, whatever might be his\r\n     desire to have it as a colony, because he did not think it worth\r\n     the risk of a war, in which he might perhaps be considered the\r\n     aggressor, and by which he should lose more than he could gain,\r\n     since sooner or later Egypt would belong to France, either by the\r\n     falling to pieces of the Turkish Empire, or by some arrangement\r\n     with the Porte.... Finally,\" he asked, \"why should not the mistress\r\n     of the seas and the mistress of the land come to an arrangement and\r\n     govern the world?\"\r\n\r\nA subtler diplomatist than Whitworth would probably have taken the\r\nhint for a Franco-British partition of the world: but the Englishman,\r\nunable at that moment to utter a word amidst the torrent of argument\r\nand invective, used the first opportunity merely to assure Napoleon of\r\nthe alarm caused in England by Sebastiani's utterance concerning\r\nEgypt. This touched the First Consul at the wrong point, and he\r\ninsisted that on the evacuation of Malta the question of peace or war\r\nmust depend. In vain did the English ambassador refer to the extension\r\nof French power on the Continent. Napoleon cut him short: \"I suppose\r\nyou mean Piedmont and Switzerland: ce sont des----: vous n'avez pas le\r\ndroit d'en parler à cette heure.\" Seeing that he was losing his\r\ntemper, Lord Whitworth then diverted the conversation.[245]\r\n\r\nThis long tirade shows clearly what were the aims of the First Consul.\r\nHe desired peace until his eastern plans were fully matured. And what\r\nruler would not desire to maintain a peace so fruitful in\r\nconquests--that perpetuated French influence in Italy, Switzerland,\r\nand Holland, that enabled France to prepare for the dissolution of the\r\nTurkish Empire and to intrigue with the Mahrattas? Those were the\r\nconditions on which England could enjoy peace: she must recognize the\r\narbitrament of France in the affairs of all neighbouring States, she\r\nmust make no claim for compensation in the Mediterranean, and she must\r\nendure to be officially informed that she alone could not maintain a\r\nstruggle against France.[246]\r\n\r\nBut George III. was not minded to sink to the level of a Charles II.\r\nWhatever were the failings of our \"farmer king,\" he was keenly alive\r\nto national honour and interests. These had been deeply wounded, even\r\nin the United Kingdom itself. Napoleon had been active in sending\r\n\"commercial commissioners\" into our land. Many of them were proved to\r\nbe soldiers: and the secret instructions sent by Talleyrand to one of\r\nthem at Dublin, which chanced to fall into the hands of our\r\nGovernment, showed that they were charged to make plans of the\r\nharbours, and of the soundings and moorings.[247]\r\n\r\nThen again, the French were almost certainly helping Irish\r\nconspirators. One of these, Emmett, already suspected of complicity in\r\nthe Despard conspiracy which aimed at the King's life, had, after its\r\nfailure, sought shelter in France. At the close of 1802 he returned to\r\nhis native land and began to store arms in a house near Rathfarnham.\r\nIt is doubtful whether the authorities were aware of his plans, or, as\r\nis more probable, let the plot come to a head. The outbreak did not\r\ntake place till the following July (after the renewal of war), when\r\nEmmett and some of his accomplices, along with Russell, who stirred up\r\nsedition in Ulster, paid for their folly with their lives. They\r\ndisavowed any connection with France, but they must have based their\r\nhope of success on a promised French invasion of our coasts.[248]\r\n\r\nThe dealings of the French commercial commissioners and the beginnings\r\nof the Emmett plot increased the tension caused by Napoleon's\r\nmasterful foreign policy; and the result was seen in the King's\r\nmessage to Parliament on March 8th, 1803. In view of the military\r\npreparations and of the wanton defiance of the First Consul's recent\r\nmessage to the Corps Législatif, Ministers asked for the embodiment of\r\nthe militia and the addition of 10,000 seamen to the navy. After\r\nNapoleon's declaration to our ambassador that France was bringing her\r\nforces on active service up to 480,000 men, the above-named increase\r\nof the British forces might well seem a reasonable measure of defence.\r\nYet it so aroused the spleen of the First Consul that, at a public\r\nreception of ambassadors on March 13th, he thus accosted Lord\r\nWhitworth:\r\n\r\n     \"'So you are determined to go to war.' 'No, First Consul,' I\r\n     replied, 'we are too sensible of the advantage of peace.' 'Why,\r\n     then, these armaments? Against whom these measures of precaution? I\r\n     have not a single ship of the line in the French ports, but if you\r\n     wish to arm I will arm also: if you wish to fight, I will fight\r\n     also. You may perhaps kill France, but will never intimidate her.'\r\n     'We wish,' said I, 'neither the one nor the other. We wish to live\r\n     on good terms with her.' 'You must respect treaties then,' replied\r\n     he; 'woe to those who do not respect treaties. They shall answer\r\n     for it to all Europe.' He was too agitated to make it advisable to\r\n     prolong the conversation: I therefore made no answer, and he\r\n     retired to his apartment, repeating the last phrase.\"[249]\r\n\r\nThis curious scene shows Napoleon in one of his weaker petulant moods:\r\nit left on the embarrassed spectators no impression of outraged\r\ndignity, but rather of the over-weening self-assertion of an autocrat\r\nwho could push on hostile preparations, and yet flout the ambassador\r\nof the Power that took reasonable precautions in return. The slight\r\noffered to our ambassador, though hotly resented in Britain, had no\r\ndirect effect on the negotiations, as the First Consul soon took the\r\nopportunity of tacitly apologizing for the occurrence; but indirectly\r\nthe matter was infinitely important. By that utterance he nailed his\r\ncolours to the mast with respect to the British evacuation of Malta.\r\nWith his keen insight into the French nature, he knew that \"honour\" was\r\nits mainspring, and that his political fortunes rested on the\r\nsatisfaction of that instinct. He could not now draw back without\r\naffronting the prestige of France and undermining his own position. In\r\nvain did our Government remind him of his admission that \"His Majesty\r\nshould keep a compensation out of his conquests for the important\r\nacquisitions of territory made by France upon the Continent.\"[250] That\r\npromise, although official, was secret. Its violation would, at the\r\nworst, only offend the officials of Whitehall. Whereas, if he now\r\nacceded to their demand that Malta should be the compensation, he at\r\nonce committed that worst of all crimes in a French statesman, of\r\nrendering himself ludicrous. In this respect, then, the scene of March\r\n13th at the Tuileries was indirectly the cause of the bloodiest war that\r\nhas desolated Europe.\r\n\r\nNapoleon now regarded the outbreak of hostilities as probable, if not\r\ncertain. Facts are often more eloquent than diplomatic assurances, and\r\nsuch facts are not wanting. On March 6th Decaen's expedition had set\r\nsail from Brest for the East Indies with no anticipation of immediate\r\nwar. On March 16th a fast brig was sent after him with orders that he\r\nshould return with all speed from Pondicherry to the Mauritius.\r\nNapoleon's correspondence also shows that, as early as March 11th,\r\nthat is, after hearing of George III.'s message to Parliament, he\r\nexpected the outbreak of hostilities: on that day he ordered the\r\nformation of flotillas at Dunkirk and Cherbourg, and sent urgent\r\nmessages to the sovereigns of Russia, Prussia, and Spain, inveighing\r\nagainst England's perfidy. The envoy despatched to St. Petersburg was\r\nspecially charged to talk to the Czar on philosophic questions, and to\r\nurge him to free the seas from England's tyranny.\r\n\r\nMuch as Addington and his colleagues loved peace, they were now\r\nconvinced that it was more hazardous than open war. Malta was the only\r\neffectual bar to a French seizure of Egypt or an invasion of Turkey from\r\nthe side of Corfu. With Turkey partitioned and Egypt in French hands,\r\nthere would be no security against Napoleon's designs on India. The\r\nBritish forces evacuated the Cape of Good Hope on February 21st, 1803;\r\nthey set sail from Alexandria on the 17th of the following month. By the\r\nformer act we yielded up to France the sea route to India--for the Dutch\r\nat the Cape were but the tools of the First Consul: by the latter we\r\nleft Malta as the sole barrier against a renewed land attack on our\r\nEastern possessions. The safety of our East Indian possessions was\r\nreally at stake, and yet Europe was asked to believe that the question\r\nwas whether England would or would not evacuate Malta. This was the\r\nFrench statement of the case: it was met by the British plea that\r\nFrance, having declared her acceptance of the principle of compensation\r\nfor us, had no cause for objecting to the retention of an island so\r\nvital to our interests.\r\n\r\nYet, while convinced of the immense importance of Malta, the Addington\r\nCabinet did not insist on retaining it, if the French Government would\r\n\"suggest some other _equivalent security_ by which His Majesty's\r\nobject in claiming the permanent possession of Malta may be\r\naccomplished and the independence of the island secured conformably to\r\nthe spirit of the 10th Article of the Treaty of Amiens.\"[251] To the\r\nFirst Consul was therefore left the initiative in proposing some other\r\nplan which would safeguard British interests in the Levant; and, with\r\nthis qualifying explanation, the British ambassador was charged to\r\npresent to him the following proposals for a new treaty: Malta to\r\nremain in British hands, the Knights to be indemnified for any losses\r\nof property which they may thereby sustain: Holland and Switzerland to\r\nbe evacuated by French troops: the island of Elba to be confirmed to\r\nFrance, and the King of Etruria to be acknowledged by Great Britain:\r\nthe Italian and Ligurian Republics also to be acknowledged, if \"an\r\narrangement is made in Italy for the King of Sardinia, which shall be\r\nsatisfactory to him.\"\r\n\r\nLord Whitworth judged it better not to present these demands point\r\nblank, but gradually to reveal their substance. This course, he\r\njudged, would be less damaging to the friends of peace at the\r\nTuileries, and less likely to affront Napoleon. But it was all one and\r\nthe same. The First Consul, in his present state of highly wrought\r\ntension, practically ignored the suggestion of an _equivalent\r\nsecurity,_ and declaimed against the perfidy of England for daring to\r\ninfringe the treaty, though he had offered no opposition to the Czar's\r\nproposals respecting Malta, which weakened the stability of the Order\r\nand sensibly modified that same treaty.\r\n\r\nTalleyrand was more conciliatory; and there is little doubt that, had\r\nthe First Consul allowed his brother Joseph and his Foreign Minister\r\nwider powers, the crisis might have been peaceably passed. Joseph\r\nBonaparte urgently pressed Whitworth to be satisfied with Corfu or\r\nCrete in place of Malta; but he confessed that the suggestion was\r\nquite unauthorized, and that the First Consul was so enraged on the\r\nMaltese Question that he dared not broach it to him.[252] Indeed, all\r\nthrough these critical weeks Napoleon's relations to his brothers were\r\nvery strained, they desiring peace in Europe so that Louisiana might\r\neven now be saved to France, while the First Consul persisted in his\r\noriental schemes. He seems now to have concentrated his energies on\r\nthe task of postponing the rupture to a convenient date and of casting\r\non his foes the odium of the approaching war. He made no proposal that\r\ncould reassure Britain as to the security of the overland routes; and\r\nhe named no other island which could be considered as an equivalent to\r\nMalta.\r\n\r\nTo many persons his position has seemed logically unassailable; but it\r\nis difficult to see how this view can be held. The Treaty of Amiens\r\nhad twice over been rendered, in a technical sense, null and void by the\r\naction of Continental Powers. Russia and Prussia had not guaranteed the\r\nstate of things arranged for Malta by that treaty; and the action of\r\nFrance and Spain in confiscating the property of the Knights in their\r\nrespective lands had so far sapped the strength of the Order that it\r\ncould never again support the expense of the large garrison which the\r\nlines around Valetta required.\r\n\r\nIn a military sense, this was the crux of the problem; for no one\r\naffected to believe that Malta was rendered secure by the presence at\r\nValetta of 2,000 troops of the King of Naples, whose realm could\r\nwithin a week be overrun by Murat's division. This obvious difficulty\r\nled Lord Hawkesbury to urge, in his notes of April 13th and later,\r\nthat British troops should garrison the chief fortifications of\r\nValetta and leave the civil power to the Knights: or, if that were\r\nfound objectionable, that we should retain complete possession of the\r\nisland for ten years, provided that we were left free to negotiate\r\nwith the King of Naples for the cession of Lampedusa, an islet to the\r\nwest of Malta. To this last proposal the First Consul offered no\r\nobjection; but he still inflexibly opposed any retention of Malta,\r\neven for ten years, and sought to make the barren islet of Lampedusa\r\nappear an equivalent to Malta. This absurd contention had, however,\r\nbeen exploded by Talleyrand's indiscreet confession \"that the\r\nre-establishment of the Order of St. John was not so much the point to\r\nbe discussed as that of suffering Great Britain to acquire a\r\n_possession in the Mediterranean_.\"[253]\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, was the pith and marrow of the whole question, whether\r\nGreat Britain was to be excluded from that great sea--save at\r\nGibraltar and Lampedusa--looking on idly at its transformation into a\r\nFrench lake by the seizure of Corfu, the Morea, Egypt, and Malta\r\nitself; or whether she should retain some hold on the overland route\r\nto the East. The difficulty was frankly pointed out by Lord Whitworth;\r\nit was as frankly admitted by Joseph Bonaparte; it was recognized by\r\nTalleyrand; and Napoleon's desire for a durable peace must have been\r\nslight when he refused to admit England's claim effectively to\r\nsafeguard her interests in the Levant, and ever fell back on the\r\nliteral fulfilment of a treaty which had been invalidated by his own\r\ndeliberate actions.\r\n\r\nAffairs now rapidly came to a climax. On April 23rd the British\r\nGovernment notified its ambassador that, if the present terms were not\r\ngranted within seven days of his receiving them, he was to leave\r\nParis. Napoleon was no less angered than surprised by the recent turn\r\nof events. In place of timid complaisance which he had expected from\r\nAddington, he was met with open defiance; but he now proposed that the\r\nCzar should offer his intervention between the disputants. The\r\nsuggestion was infinitely skilful. It flattered the pride of the young\r\nautocrat and promised to yield gains as substantial as those which\r\nRussian mediation had a year before procured for France from the\r\nintimidated Sultan; it would help to check the plans for an\r\nAnglo-Russian alliance then being mooted at St. Petersburg, and, above\r\nall, it served to gain time.\r\n\r\nAll these advantages were to a large extent realized. Though the Czar\r\nhad been the first to suggest our retention of Malta, he now began to\r\nwaver. The clearness and precision of Talleyrand's notes, and the\r\ntelling charge of perfidy against England, made an impression which\r\nthe cumbrous retorts of Lord Hawkesbury and the sailor-like diplomacy\r\nof Admiral Warren failed to efface.[254] And the Russian Chancellor,\r\nVorontzoff, though friendly to England, and desirous of seeing her\r\nfirmly established at Malta, now began to complain of the want of\r\nclearness in her policy. The Czar emphasized this complaint, and\r\nsuggested that, as Malta could not be the real cause of dispute, the\r\nBritish Government should formulate distinctly its grievances and so set\r\nthe matter in train for a settlement. The suggestion was not complied\r\nwith. To draw up a long list of complaints, some drawn from secret\r\nsources and exposing the First Consul's schemes, would have exasperated\r\nhis already ruffled temper; and the proposal can only be regarded as an\r\nadroit means of justifying Alexander's sudden change of front.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile events had proceeded apace at Paris. On April 26th Joseph\r\nBonaparte made a last effort to bend his brother's will, but only\r\ngained the grudging concession that Napoleon would never consent to\r\nthe British retention of Malta for a longer time than three or four\r\nyears. As this would have enabled him to postpone the rupture long\r\nenough to mature his oriental plans, it was rejected by Lord\r\nWhitworth, who insisted on ten years as the minimum. The evident\r\ndetermination of the British Government speedily to terminate the\r\naffair, one way or the other, threw Napoleon into a paroxysm of\r\npassion; and at the diplomatic reception of May 1st, from which Lord\r\nWhitworth discreetly absented himself, he vehemently inveighed against\r\nits conduct. Fretted by the absence of our ambassador, for whom this\r\nsally had been intended, he returned to St. Cloud, and there dictated\r\nthis curious epistle to Talleyrand:\r\n\r\n     \"I desire that your conference [with Lord Whitworth] shall not\r\n     degenerate into a conversation. Show yourself cold, reserved, and\r\n     even somewhat proud. If the [British] note contains the word\r\n     _ultimatum_ make him feel that this word implies war; if it does\r\n     not contain this word, make him insert it, remarking to him that we\r\n     must know where we are, that we are tired of this state of\r\n     anxiety.... Soften down a little at the end of the conference, and\r\n     invite him to return before writing to his Court.\"\r\n\r\nBut this careful rehearsal was to avail nothing; our stolid ambassador\r\nwas not to be cajoled, and on May 2nd, that is, seven days after his\r\npresenting our ultimatum, he sent for his passports. He did not,\r\nhowever, set out immediately. Yielding to an urgent request, he\r\ndelayed his departure in order to hear the French reply to the British\r\nultimatum.[255] It notified sarcastically that Lampedusa was not in\r\nthe First Consul's power to bestow, that any change with reference to\r\nMalta must be referred by Great Britain to the Great Powers for their\r\nconcurrence, and that Holland would be evacuated as soon as the terms\r\nof the Treaty of Amiens were complied with. Another proposal was that\r\nMalta should be transferred to Russia--the very step which was\r\nproposed at Amiens and was rejected by the Czar: on that account Lord\r\nWhitworth now refused it as being merely a device to gain time. The\r\nsending of his passports having been delayed, he received one more\r\ndespatch from Downing Street, which allowed that our retention of\r\nMalta for ten years should form a secret article--a device which would\r\nspare the First Consul's susceptibilities on the point of honour. Even\r\nso, however, Napoleon refused to consider a longer tenure than two or\r\nthree years. And in this he was undoubtedly encouraged by the recent\r\ndespatch from St. Petersburg, wherein the Czar promised his mediation\r\nin a sense favourable to France. This unfortunate occurrence completed\r\nthe discomfiture of the peace party at the Consular Court, and in a\r\nlong and heated discussion in a council held at St. Cloud on May 11th\r\nall but Joseph Bonaparte and Talleyrand voted for the rejection of\r\nthe British demands.\r\n\r\nOn the next day Lord Whitworth left Paris. During his journey to\r\nCalais he received one more proposal, that France should hold the\r\npeninsula of Otranto for ten years if Great Britain retained Malta for\r\nthat period; but if this suggestion was made in good faith, which is\r\ndoubtful, its effect was destroyed by a rambling diatribe which\r\nTalleyrand, at his master's orders, sent shortly afterwards.[256] In\r\nany case it was looked upon by our ambassador as a last attempt to gain\r\ntime for the concentration of the French naval forces. He crossed the\r\nStraits of Dover on May 17th, the day before the British declaration of\r\nwar was issued.\r\n\r\nOn May 22nd, 1803, appeared at Paris the startling order that, as\r\nBritish frigates had captured two French merchantmen on the Breton\r\ncoast, all Englishmen between eighteen and sixty years of age who were\r\nin France should be detained as prisoners of war. The pretext for this\r\nunheard-of action, which condemned some 10,000 Britons to prolonged\r\ndetention, was that the two French ships were seized prior to the\r\ndeclaration of war. This is false: they were seized on May 18th, that\r\nis, on the day on which the British Government declared war, three\r\ndays after an embargo had been laid on British vessels in French\r\nports, and seven days after the First Consul had directed his envoy at\r\nFlorence to lay an embargo on English ships in the ports of\r\nTuscany.[257] It is therefore obvious that Napoleon's barbarous decree\r\nmerely marked his disappointment at the failure of his efforts to gain\r\ntime and to deal the first stroke. How sorely his temper was tried by\r\nthe late events is clear from the recital of the Duchesse d'Abrantès,\r\nwho relates that her husband, when ordered to seize English residents,\r\nfound the First Consul in a fury, his eyes flashing fire; and when\r\nJunot expressed his reluctance to carry out this decree, Napoleon\r\npassionately exclaimed: \"Do not trust too far to my friendship: as\r\nsoon as I conceive doubt as to yours, mine is gone.\"\r\n\r\nFew persons in England now cherished any doubts as to the First\r\nConsul's hatred of the nation which stood between him and his oriental\r\ndesigns. Ministers alone knew the extent of those plans: but every\r\nploughboy could feel the malice of an act which cooped up innocent\r\ntravellers on the flimsiest of pretexts. National ardour, and, alas,\r\nnational hatred were deeply stirred.[258] The Whigs, who had paraded the\r\nclemency of Napoleon, were at once helpless, and found themselves\r\nreduced to impotence for wellnigh a generation; and the Tories, who\r\nseemed the exponents of a national policy, were left in power until the\r\nstream of democracy, dammed up by war in 1793 and again in 1803,\r\nasserted its full force in the later movement for reform.\r\n\r\nYet the opinion often expressed by pamphleteers, that the war of 1803\r\nwas undertaken to compel France to abandon her republican principles,\r\nis devoid of a shred of evidence in its favour. After 1802 there were\r\nno French republican principles to be combated; they had already been\r\njettisoned; and, since Bonaparte had crushed the Jacobins, his\r\npersonal claims were favourably regarded at Whitehall, Addington even\r\nassuring the French envoy that he would welcome the establishment of\r\nhereditary succession in the First Consul's family.[259] But while\r\nBonaparte's own conduct served to refute the notion that the war of\r\n1803 was a war of principles, his masterful policy in Europe and the\r\nLevant convinced every well-informed man that peace was impossible;\r\nand the rupture was accompanied by acts and insults to the \"nation of\r\nshopkeepers\" that could be avenged only by torrents of blood.\r\nDiatribes against perfidious Albion filled the French Press and\r\noverflowed into splenetic pamphlets, one of which bade odious England\r\ntremble under the consciousness of her bad faith and the expectation\r\nof swift and condign chastisement. Such was the spirit in which these\r\nnations rushed to arms; and the conflict was scarcely to cease until\r\nNapoleon was flung out into the solitudes of the southern Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the rupture of the Peace of Amiens will be realized if\r\nwe briefly survey Bonaparte's position after that treaty was signed. He\r\nhad regained for his adopted country a colonial empire and had given\r\naway not a single French island. France was raised to a position of\r\nassured strength far preferable to the perilous heights attained later\r\non at Tilsit. In Australia there was a prospect that the tricolour would\r\nwave over areas as great and settlements as prosperous as those of New\r\nSouth Wales and the infant town of Sydney. From the Ile de France and\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope as convenient bases of operations, British India\r\ncould easily be assailed; and a Franco-Mahratta alliance promised to\r\nyield a victory over the troops of the East India Company. In Europe the\r\nimminent collapse of the Turkish Empire invited a partition, whence\r\nFrance might hope to gain Egypt and the Morea. The Ionian Isles were\r\nready to accept French annexation; and, if England withdrew her troops\r\nfrom Malta, the fate of the weak Order of St. John could scarcely be a\r\nmatter of doubt.\r\n\r\nFor the fulfilment of these bright hopes one thing alone was needed, a\r\npolicy of peace and naval preparation. As yet Napoleon's navy was\r\ncomparatively weak. In March, 1803, he had only forty-three\r\nline-of-battle ships, ten of which were on distant stations; but he\r\nhad ordered twenty-three more to be built--ten of them in Holland;\r\nand, with the harbours of France, Holland, Flanders, and Northern\r\nItaly at his disposal, he might hope, at the close of 1804, to\r\nconfront the flag of St. George with a superiority of force. That was\r\nthe time which his secret instructions to Decaen marked out for the\r\noutbreak of the war that would yield to the tricolour a world-wide\r\nsupremacy.\r\n\r\nThese schemes miscarried owing to the impetuosity of their contriver.\r\nHustled out of the arena of European politics, and threatened with\r\nFrench supremacy in the other Continents, England forthwith drew the\r\nsword; and her action, cutting athwart the far-reaching web of the\r\nNapoleonic intrigues, forced France to forego her oceanic plans, to\r\nmuster her forces on the Straits of Dover, and thereby to yield to the\r\nEnglish race the supremacy in Louisiana, India, and Australia, leaving\r\nalso the destinies of Egypt to be decided in a later age. Viewed from\r\nthe standpoint of racial expansion, the renewal of war in 1803 is the\r\ngreatest event of the century.\r\n\r\n[Since this chapter was printed, articles on the same subject have\r\nappeared in the \"Revue Historique\" (March-June, 1901) by M.\r\nPhilippson, which take almost the same view as that here presented. I\r\ncannot, however, agree with the learned writer that Napoleon wanted\r\nwar. I think he did not, _until his navy was ready_; but it was not in\r\nhim to give way.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION\r\n\r\n     M. Coquelle, in a work which has been translated into English by\r\n     Mr. Gordon D. Knox (G. Bell and Sons, Ltd.), has shown clearly that\r\n     the non-evacuation of Holland by Napoleon's troops and the\r\n     subjection of that Republic to French influence formed the chief\r\n     causes of war. I refer my readers to that work for details of the\r\n     negotiations in their final stages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nEUROPE AND THE BONAPARTES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe disappointment felt by Napoleon at England's interruption of his\r\ndesigns may be measured, first by his efforts to postpone the rupture,\r\nand thereafter by the fierce energy which he threw into the war. As\r\nhas been previously noted, the Czar had responded to the First\r\nConsul's appeal for mediation in notes which seemed to the British\r\nCabinet unjustly favourable to the French case. Napoleon now offered\r\nto recognize the arbitration of the Czar on the questions in dispute,\r\nand suggested that meanwhile Malta should be handed over to Russia to\r\nbe held in pledge: he on his part offered to evacuate Hanover,\r\nSwitzerland, and Holland, if the British would suspend hostilities, to\r\ngrant an indemnity to the King of Sardinia, to allow Britain to occupy\r\nLampedusa, and fully to assure \"the independence of Europe,\" if France\r\nretained her present frontiers. But when the Russian envoy, Markoff,\r\nurged him to crown these proposals by allowing Britain to hold Malta\r\nfor a certain time, thereafter to be agreed upon, he firmly refused to\r\ndo so on his own initiative, for that would soil his honour: but he\r\nwould view with resignation its cession to Britain if that proved to\r\nbe the award of Alexander. Accordingly Markoff wrote to his colleague\r\nat London, assuring him that the peace of the world was now once again\r\nassured by the noble action of the First Consul.[260]\r\n\r\nWere these proposals prompted by a sincere desire to assure a lasting\r\npeace, or were they put forward as a device to gain time for the\r\ncompletion of the French naval preparations? Evidently they were\r\ncompletely distrusted by the British Government, and with some reason.\r\nThey were nearly identical with the terms formulated in the British\r\nultimatum, which Napoleon had rejected. Moreover, our Foreign Office\r\nhad by this time come to suspect Alexander. On June 23rd Lord\r\nHawkesbury wrote that it might be most damaging to British interests\r\nto place Malta \"at the hazard of the Czar's arbitration\"; and he\r\ninformed the Russian ambassador, Count Vorontzoff, that the aim of the\r\nFrench had obviously been merely to gain time, that their explanations\r\nwere loose and unsatisfactory, and their demands inadmissible, and\r\nthat Great Britain could not acknowledge the present territories of\r\nthe French Republic as permanent while Malta was placed in\r\narbitration. In fact, our Government feared that, when Malta had been\r\nplaced in Alexander's hands, Napoleon would lure him into oriental\r\nadventures and renew the plans of an advance on India. Their fears\r\nwere well founded.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's preoccupation was always for the East: on February 21st,\r\n1803, he had charged his Minister of Marine to send arms and\r\nammunition to the Suliotes and Maniotes then revolting against the\r\nSultan; and at midsummer French agents were at Ragusa to prepare for a\r\nlanding at the mouth of the River Cattaro.[261] With Turkey rent by\r\nrevolt, Malta placed as a pledge in Russian keeping, and Alexander\r\ndrawn into the current of Napoleon's designs, what might not be\r\naccomplished? Evidently the First Consul could expect more from this\r\ncourse of events than from barren strifes with Nelson's ships in the\r\nStraits of Dover. For _us_, such a peace was far more risky than war.\r\nAnd yet, if the Czar's offer were too stiffly repelled, public opinion\r\nwould everywhere be alienated, and in that has always lain half the\r\nstrength of England's policy.[262] Ministers therefore declared that,\r\nwhile they could not accept Russia's arbitration without appeal, they\r\nwould accede to her mediation if it concerned all the causes of the\r\npresent war. This reasonable proposal was accepted by the Czar, but\r\nreceived from Napoleon a firm refusal. He at once wrote to Talleyrand,\r\nAugust 23rd, 1803, directing that the Russian proposals should be made\r\nknown to Haugwitz, the Prussian Foreign Minister:\r\n\r\n     \"Make him see all the absurdity of it: tell him that England will\r\n     never get from me any other treaty than that of Amiens: that _I\r\n     will never suffer her to have anything in the Mediterranean_; that\r\n     I will not treat with her about the Continent; that I am resolved\r\n     to evacuate Holland and Switzerland; but that I will never\r\n     stipulate this in an article.\"\r\n\r\nAs for Russia, he continued, she talked much about the integrity of\r\nTurkey, but was violating it by the occupation of the Ionian Isles and\r\nher constant intrigues in Wallachia. These facts were correct: but the\r\nmanner in which he stated them clearly revealed his annoyance that the\r\nCzar would not wholly espouse the French cause. Talleyrand's views on\r\nthis question may be seen in his letter to Bonaparte, when he assures\r\nhis chief that he has now reaped from his noble advance to the Russian\r\nEmperor the sole possible advantage--\"that of proving to Europe by a\r\ngrand act of frankness your love of peace and to throw upon England\r\nthe whole blame for the war.\" It is not often that a diplomatist so\r\nclearly reveals the secrets of his chief's policy.[263]\r\n\r\nThe motives of Alexander were less questionable. His chief desire at\r\nthat time was to improve the lot of his people. War would disarrange\r\nthese noble designs: France would inevitably overrun the weaker\r\nContinental States: England would retaliate by enforcing her severe\r\nmaritime code; and the whole world would be rent in twain by this\r\nstrife of the elements.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese gloomy forebodings were soon to be realized. Holland was the\r\nfirst to suffer. And yet one effort was made to spare her the horrors\r\nof war. Filled with commiseration for her past sufferings, the British\r\nGovernment at once offered to respect her neutrality, provided that\r\nthe French troops would evacuate her fortresses and exact no succour\r\neither in ships, men, or money.[264] But such forbearance was scarcely\r\nto be expected from Napoleon, who not only had a French division in\r\nthat land, supported at its expense, but also relied on its maritime\r\nresources.[265] The proposal was at once set aside at Paris.\r\nNapoleon's decision to drag the Batavian Republic into the war arose,\r\nhowever, from no spasm of the war fever; it was calmly stated in the\r\nsecret instructions issued to General Decaen in the preceding January.\r\n\"It is now considered impossible that we could have war with England,\r\nwithout dragging Holland into it.\" Holland was accordingly once more\r\nground between the upper and the nether millstone, between the Sea\r\nPower and the Land Power, pouring out for Napoleon its resources in\r\nmen and money, and losing to the masters of the sea its ships, foreign\r\ncommerce, and colonies.\r\n\r\nEqually hard was the treatment of Naples. In spite of the Czar's plea\r\nthat its neutrality might be respected, this kingdom was at once\r\noccupied by St. Cyr with troops that held the chief positions on the\r\n\"heel\" of Italy. This infraction of the Treaty of Florence was to be\r\njustified by a proclamation asserting that, as England had retained\r\nMalta, the balance of power required that France should hold these\r\npositions as long as England held Malta.[266] This action punished the\r\nKing and Queen of Naples for their supposed subservience to English\r\npolicy; and, while lightening the burdens of the French exchequer, it\r\ncompelled England to keep a large fleet in the Mediterranean for the\r\nprotection of Egypt, and thereby weakened her defensive powers in the\r\nStraits of Dover. To distract his foes, and compel them to extend\r\ntheir lines, was ever Napoleon's aim both in military and naval\r\nstrategy; and the occupation of Taranto, together with the naval\r\nactivity at Toulon and Genoa, left it doubtful whether the great\r\ncaptain determined to strike at London or to resume his eastern\r\nadventures. His previous moves all seemed to point towards Egypt and\r\nIndia; and the Admiralty instructions of May 18th, 1803, to Nelson,\r\nreveal the expectation of our Government that the real blow would fall\r\non the Morea and Egypt. Six weeks later our admiral reported the\r\nactivity of French intrigues in the Morea, which was doubtless\r\nintended to be their halfway house to Egypt--\"when sooner or later,\r\nfarewell India.\"[267] Proofs of Napoleon's designs on the Morea were\r\nfound by Captain Keats of H.M.S. \"Superb\" on a French vessel that he\r\ncaptured, a French corporal having on him a secret letter from an\r\nagent at Corfu, dated May 23rd, 1803. It ended thus:\r\n\r\n     \"I have every reason to believe that we shall soon have a\r\n     revolution in the Morea, as we desire. I have close relations with\r\n     Crepacchi, and we are in daily correspondence with all the chiefs\r\n     of the Morea: we have even provided them with munitions of\r\n     war.\"[268]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, it seems probable that Napoleon's chief aim now\r\nwas London and not Egypt; but his demonstrations eastwards were so\r\nskilfully maintained as to convince both the English Government and\r\nNelson that his real aim was Egypt or Malta. For this project the\r\nFrench _corps d'armée_ in the \"heel\" of Italy held a commanding\r\nposition. Ships alone were wanting; and these he sought to compel the\r\nKing of Naples to furnish. As early as April 20th, 1803, our _chargé\r\nd'affaires_ at Naples, Mr. à Court, reported that Napoleon was pressing\r\non that Government a French alliance, on the ground that:\r\n\r\n     \"The interests of the two countries are the same: it is the\r\n     intention of France to shut every port to the English, from Holland\r\n     to the Turkish dominions, to prevent the exportation of her\r\n     merchandise, and to give a mortal blow to her commerce, for there\r\n     she is most vulnerable. Our joint forces may wrest from her hands\r\n     the island of Malta. The Sicilian navy may convoy and protect the\r\n     French troops in the prosecution of such a plan, and the most happy\r\n     result may be augured to their united exertions.\"\r\n\r\nPossibly the King and his spirited but whimsical consort, Queen\r\nCharlotte, might have bent before the threats which accompanied this\r\nalluring offer; but at the head of the Neapolitan administration was\r\nan Englishman, General Acton, whose talents and force of will\r\ncommanded their respect and confidence. To the threats of the French\r\nambassador he answered that France was strong and Naples was weak;\r\nforce might overthrow the dynasty; but nothing would induce it to\r\nviolate its neutrality towards England. So unwonted a defiance aroused\r\nNapoleon to a characteristic revenge. When his troops were quartered\r\non Southern Italy, and were draining the Neapolitan resources, the\r\nQueen wrote appealing to his clemency on behalf of her much burdened\r\npeople. In reply he assured her of his desire to be agreeable to her:\r\nbut how could he look on Naples as a neutral State, when its chief\r\nMinister was an Englishman? This was \"the real reason that justified\r\nall the measures taken towards Naples.\"[269] The brutality and\r\nfalseness of this reply had no other effect than to embitter Queen\r\nCharlotte's hatred against the arbiter of the world's destinies,\r\nbefore whom she and her consort refused to bow, even when, three years\r\nlater, they were forced to seek shelter behind the girdle of the\r\ninviolate sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHanover also fell into Napoleon's hands. Mortier with 25,000 French\r\ntroops speedily overran that land and compelled the Duke of Cambridge\r\nto a capitulation. The occupation of the Electorate not only relieved\r\nthe French exchequer of the support of a considerable corps; it also\r\nserved to hold in check the Prussian Court, always preoccupied about\r\nHanover; and it barred the entrance of the Elbe and Weser to British\r\nships, an aim long cherished by Napoleon. To this we retorted by\r\nblockading the mouths of those rivers, an act which must have been\r\nexpected by Napoleon, and which enabled him to declaim against British\r\nmaritime tyranny. In truth, the beginnings of the Continental System\r\nwere now clearly discernible. The shores of the Continent from the\r\nsouth of Italy to the mouth of the Elbe were practically closed to\r\nEnglish ships, while by a decree of July 15th _any vessel whatsoever_\r\nthat had cleared from a British port was to be excluded from all\r\nharbours of the French Republic. Thus all commercial nations were\r\ncompelled, slowly but inevitably, to side with the master of the land\r\nor the mistress of the seas.\r\n\r\nIn vain did the King of Prussia represent to Napoleon that Hanover was\r\nnot British territory, and that the neutrality of Germany was\r\ninfringed and its interests damaged by the French occupation of\r\nHanover and Cuxhaven. His protest was met by an offer from Napoleon to\r\nevacuate Hanover, Taranto and Otranto, only at the time when England\r\nshould \"evacuate Malta and the Mediterranean\"; and though the special\r\nPrussian envoy, Lombard, reported to his master that Napoleon was\r\n\"truth, loyalty, and friendship personified,\" yet he received not a\r\nword that betokened real regard for the susceptibilities of Frederick\r\nWilliam III. or the commerce of his people.[270] For the present,\r\nneither King nor Czar ventured on further remonstrances; but the First\r\nConsul had sown seeds of discord which were to bear fruit in the Third\r\nCoalition.\r\n\r\nHaving quartered 60,000 French troops on Naples and Hanover, Napoleon\r\ncould face with equanimity the costs of the war. Gigantic as they were,\r\nthey could be met from the purchase money of Louisiana, the taxation and\r\nvoluntary gifts of the French dominions, the subsidies of the Italian\r\nand Ligurian Republics, and a contribution which he now exacted from\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nEven before the outbreak of hostilities he had significantly reminded\r\nCharles IV. that the Spanish marine was deteriorating, and her\r\narsenals and dockyards were idle: \"But England is not asleep; she is\r\never on the watch and will never rest until she has seized on the\r\ncolonies and commerce of the world.\"[271] For the present, however,\r\nthe loss of Trinidad and the sale of Louisiana rankled too deeply to\r\nadmit of Spain entering into another conflict, whence, as before,\r\nNapoleon would doubtless gain the glory and leave to her the burden of\r\nterritorial sacrifices. In spite of his shameless relations to the\r\nQueen of Spain, Godoy, the Spanish Minister, was not devoid of\r\npatriotism; and he strove to evade the obligations which the treaty of\r\n1796 imposed on Spain in case of an Anglo-French conflict. He embodied\r\nthe militia of the north of Spain and doubtless would have defied\r\nBonaparte's demands, had Russia and Prussia shown any disposition to\r\nresist French aggressions. But those Powers were as yet wholly devoted\r\nto private interests; and when Napoleon threatened Charles IV. and\r\nGodoy with an inroad of 80,000 French troops unless the Spanish\r\nmilitia were dissolved and 72,000,000 francs were paid every year into\r\nthe French exchequer, the Court of Madrid speedily gave way. Its\r\nsurrender was further assured by the thinly veiled threat that further\r\nresistance would lead to the exposure of the _liaison_ between Godoy\r\nand the Queen. Spain therefore engaged to pay the required sum--more\r\nthan double the amount stipulated in 1796--to further the interests of\r\nFrench commerce and to bring pressure to bear on Portugal. At\r\nthe close of the year the Court of Lisbon, yielding to the threats\r\nof France and Spain, consented to purchase its neutrality by\r\nthe payment of a million francs a month to the master of the\r\nContinent.[272]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the First Consul was throwing his untiring energies into the\r\nenterprise of crushing his redoubtable foe. He pushed on the naval\r\npreparations at all the dockyards of France, Holland, and North Italy;\r\nthe great mole that was to shelter the roadstead at Cherbourg was\r\nhurried forward, and the coast from the Seine to the Rhine became \"a\r\ncoast of iron and bronze\"--to use Marmont's picturesque phrase--while\r\nevery harbour swarmed with small craft destined for an invasion.\r\nTroops were withdrawn from the Rhenish frontiers and encamped along\r\nthe shores of Picardy; others were stationed in reserve at St. Omer,\r\nMontreuil, Bruges, and Utrecht; while smaller camps were formed at\r\nGhent, Compiègne, and St. Malo. The banks of the Elbe, Weser, Scheldt,\r\nSomme, and Seine--even as far up as Paris itself--rang with the blows\r\nof shipwrights labouring to strengthen the flotilla of flat-bottomed\r\nvessels designed for the invasion of England. Troops, to the number of\r\n50,000 at Boulogne under Soult, 30,000 at Etaples, and as many at\r\nBruges, commanded by Ney and Davoust respectively, were organized\r\nanew, and by constant drill and exposure to the elements formed the\r\ntough nucleus of the future Grand Army, before which the choicest\r\ntroops of Czar and Kaiser were to be scattered in headlong rout. To\r\nall these many-sided exertions of organization and drill, of improving\r\nharbours and coast fortifications, of ship-building, testing,\r\nembarking, and disembarking, the First Consul now and again applied\r\nthe spur of his personal supervision; for while the warlike enthusiasm\r\nwhich he had aroused against perfidious Albion of itself achieved\r\nwonders, yet work was never so strenuous and exploits so daring as\r\nunder the eyes of the great captain himself. He therefore paid\r\nfrequent visits to the north coast, surveying with critical eyes the\r\nworks at Boulogne, Calais, Dunkirk,\r\n\r\n\r\nOstend, and Antwerp. The last-named port engaged his special\r\nattention. Its position at the head of the navigable estuary of the\r\nScheldt, exactly opposite the Thames, marked it out as the natural\r\nrival of London; he now encouraged its commerce and ordered the\r\nconstruction of a dockyard fitted to contain twenty-five battleships\r\nand a proportionate number of frigates and sloops. Antwerp was to\r\nbecome the great commercial and naval emporium of the North Sea. The\r\ntime seemed to favour the design; Hamburg and Bremen were blockaded,\r\nand London for a space was menaced by the growing power of the First\r\nConsul, who seemed destined to restore to the Flemish port the\r\nprosperity which the savagery of Alva had swept away with such profit\r\nto Elizabethan London. But grand as were Napoleon's enterprises at\r\nAntwerp, they fell far short of his ulterior designs. He told Las\r\nCases at St. Helena that the dockyard and magazines were to have been\r\nprotected by a gigantic fortress built on the opposite side of the\r\nRiver Scheldt, and that Antwerp was to have been \"a loaded pistol held\r\nat the head of England.\"\r\n\r\nIn both lands warlike ardour rose to the highest pitch. French towns\r\nand Departments freely offered gifts of gunboats and battleships. And\r\nin England public men vied with one another in their eagerness to\r\nequip and maintain volunteer regiments. Wordsworth, who had formerly\r\nsung the praises of the French Revolution, thus voiced the national\r\ndefiance:\r\n\r\n  \"No parleying now! In Britain is one breath;\r\n  We all are with you now from shore to shore;\r\n  Ye men of Kent, 'tis victory or death.\"\r\n\r\nIn one respect England enjoyed a notable advantage. Having declared\r\nwar before Napoleon's plans were matured, she held the command of the\r\nseas, even against the naval resources of France, Holland, and North\r\nItaly. The first months of the war witnessed the surrender of St.\r\nLucia and Tobago to our fleets; and before the close of the year\r\nBerbice, Demerara, Essequibo, together with < nearly the whole of the\r\nFrench St. Domingo force, had capitulated to the Union Jack. Our naval\r\nsupremacy in the Channel now told with full effect. Frigates were ever\r\non the watch in the Straits to chase any French vessels that left\r\nport. But our chief efforts were to blockade the enemy's ships.\r\nDespite constant ill-health and frequent gales, Nelson clung to\r\nToulon. Admiral Cornwallis cruised off Brest with a fleet generally\r\nexceeding fifteen sail of the line and several smaller vessels: six\r\nfrigates and smaller craft protected the coast of Ireland; six\r\nline-of-battle ships and twenty-three lesser vessels were kept in the\r\nDowns under Lord Keith as a central reserve force, to which the news\r\nof all events transpiring on the enemy's coast was speedily conveyed\r\nby despatch boats; the newly invented semaphore telegraphs were also\r\nsystematically used between the Isle of Wight and Deal to convey news\r\nalong the coast and to London. Martello towers were erected along the\r\ncoast from Harwich to Pevensey Bay, at the points where a landing was\r\neasy. Numerous inventors also came forward with plans for destroying\r\nthe French flotilla, but none was found to be serviceable except the\r\nrockets of Colonel Congreve, which inflicted some damage at Boulogne\r\nand elsewhere. Such were the dispositions of our chief naval forces:\r\nthey comprised 469 ships of war, and over 700 armed boats, of all\r\nsizes.[273]\r\n\r\nOur regular troops and militia mustered 180,000 strong; while the\r\nvolunteers, including 120,000 men armed with pikes or similar weapons,\r\nnumbered 410,000. Of course little could be hoped from these last in a\r\nconflict with French veterans; and even the regulars, in the absence\r\nof any great generals--for Wellesley was then in India--might have\r\noffered but a poor resistance to Napoleon's military machine.\r\nPreparations were, however, made for a desperate resistance. Plans\r\nwere quietly framed for the transfer of the Queen and the royal family\r\nto Worcester, along with the public treasure, which was to be lodged\r\nin the cathedral; while the artillery and stores from Woolwich arsenal\r\nwere to be conveyed into the Midlands by the Grand Junction\r\nCanal.[274]\r\n\r\nThe scheme of coast-defence which General Dundas had drawn up in 1796\r\nwas now again set in action. It included, not only the disposition of\r\nthe armed forces, but plans for the systematic removal of all\r\nprovisions, stores, animals, and fodder from the districts threatened\r\nby the invader; and it is clear that the country was far better\r\nprepared than French writers have been willing to admit. Indeed, so\r\ngreat was the expense of these defensive preparations that, when\r\nNelson's return from the West Indies disconcerted the enemy's plans,\r\nFox merged the statesman in the partisan by the curious assertion that\r\nthe invasion scare had been got up by the Pitt Ministry for party\r\npurposes.[275] Few persons shared that opinion. The nation was\r\nanimated by a patriotism such as had never yet stirred the sluggish\r\nveins of Georgian England. The Jacobinism, which Dundas in 1796 had\r\nlamented as paralyzing the nation's energy, had wholly vanished; and\r\nthe fatality which dogged the steps of Napoleon was already\r\ndiscernible. The mingled hatred and fear which he inspired outside\r\nFrance was beginning to solidify the national resistance: after\r\nuniting rich and poor, English and Scots in a firm phalanx in the\r\nUnited Kingdom, the national principle was in turn to vivify Spain,\r\nRussia, and Germany, and thus to assure his overthrow.\r\n\r\nReserving for consideration in another chapter the later developments\r\nof the naval war, it will be convenient now to turn to important\r\nevents in the history of the Bonaparte family.\r\n\r\nThe loves and intrigues of the Bonapartes have furnished material enough\r\nto fill several volumes devoted to light gossip, and naturally so. Given\r\nan ambitious family, styled _parvenus_ by the ungenerous, shooting aloft\r\nswiftly as the flames of Vesuvius, ardent as its inner fires, and\r\nstubborn as its hardened lava--given also an imperious brother\r\ndetermined to marry his younger brothers and sisters, not as they\r\nwilled, but as he willed--and it is clear that materials are at hand\r\nsufficient to make the fortunes of a dozen comediettas.\r\n\r\nTo the marriage of Pauline Bonaparte only the briefest reference need\r\nhere be made. The wild humour of her blood showed itself before her\r\nfirst marriage; and after the death of her husband, General Leclerc,\r\nin San Domingo, she privately espoused Prince Borghese before the\r\nlegal time of mourning had expired, an indiscretion which much annoyed\r\nNapoleon (August, 1803). Ultimately this brilliant, frivolous creature\r\nresided in the splendid mansion which now forms the British embassy in\r\nParis. The case of Louis Bonaparte was somewhat different. Nurtured as\r\nhe had been in his early years by Napoleon, he had rewarded him by\r\ncontracting a dutiful match with Hortense Beauharnais (January, 1802);\r\nbut that union was to be marred by a grotesquely horrible jealousy\r\nwhich the young husband soon conceived for his powerful brother.\r\n\r\nFor the present, however, the chief trouble was caused by Lucien,\r\nwhose address had saved matters at the few critical minutes of\r\nBrumaire. Gifted with a strong vein of literary feeling and oratorical\r\nfire he united in his person the obstinacy of a Bonaparte, the\r\nheadstrong feelings of a poet, and the dogmatism of a Corsican\r\nrepublican. His presumptuous conduct had already embroiled him with\r\nthe First Consul, who deprived him of his Ministry and sent him as\r\nambassador to Madrid.[276] He further sinned, first by hurrying on\r\npeace with Portugal--it is said for a handsome present from\r\nLisbon--and later by refusing to marry the widow of the King of\r\nEtruria. In this he persisted, despite the urgent representations of\r\nNapoleon and Joseph: \"You know very well that I am a republican, and\r\nthat a queen is not what suits me, an ugly queen too!\"--\" What a pity\r\nyour answer was not cut short, it would have been quite Roman,\" sneered\r\nJoseph at his younger brother, once the Brutus of the Jacobin clubs. But\r\nLucien was proof against all the splendours of the royal match; he was\r\nmadly in love with a Madame Jouberthon, the deserted wife of a Paris\r\nstockbroker; and in order to checkmate all Napoleon's attempts to force\r\non a hated union, he had secretly married the lady of his choice at the\r\nvillage of Plessis-Chamant, hard by his country house (October 26th,\r\n1803).\r\n\r\nThe letter which divulged the news of this affair reached the First\r\nConsul at St. Cloud on an interesting occasion.[277] It was during a\r\nso-called family concert, to which only the choicest spirits had been\r\ninvited, whence also, to Josephine's chagrin, Napoleon had excluded\r\nMadame Tallien and several other old friends, whose reputation would\r\nhave tainted the air of religion and morality now pervading the\r\nConsular Court. While this select company was enjoying the strains of\r\nthe chamber music, and Napoleon alone was dozing, Lucien's missive was\r\nhanded in by the faithful if indiscreet Duroc. A change came over the\r\nscene. At once Napoleon started up, called out \"Stop the music: stop,\"\r\nand began with nervous strides and agitated gestures to pace the hall,\r\nexclaiming \"Treason! it is treason!\" Round-eyed, open-mouthed\r\nwonder seized on the disconcerted musicians, the company rose in\r\nconfusion, and Josephine, following her spouse, besought him to say\r\nwhat had happened. \"What has happened--why--Lucien has married\r\nhis--mistress.\"[278]\r\n\r\nThe secret cause for this climax of fashionable comedy is to be sought\r\nin reasons of state. The establishment of hereditary power was then\r\nbeing secretly and anxiously discussed. Napoleon had no heirs: Joseph's\r\nchildren were girls: Lucien's first marriage also had naught but female\r\nissue: the succession must therefore devolve on Lucien's children by a\r\nsecond marriage. But a natural son had already been born to him by\r\nMadame Jouberthon; and his marriage now promised to make this bastard\r\nthe heir to the future French imperial throne. That was the reason why\r\nNapoleon paced the hall at St. Cloud, \"waving his arms like a\r\nsemaphore,\" and exclaiming \"treason!\" Failing the birth of sons to the\r\ntwo elder brothers, Lucien's marriage seriously endangered the\r\nfoundation of a Napoleonic dynasty; besides, the whole affair would\r\nyield excellent sport to the royalists of the Boulevard St. Germain, the\r\nsnarling Jacobins of the back streets, and the newspaper writers of\r\nhated Albion.\r\n\r\nIn vain were negotiations set on foot to make Lucien divorce his\r\nwife. The attempt only produced exasperation, Joseph himself finally\r\naccusing Napoleon of bad faith in the course of this affair. In the\r\nfollowing springtime Lucien shook off the dust of France from his\r\nfeet, and declared in a last letter to Joseph that he departed, hating\r\nNapoleon. The moral to this curious story was well pointed by Joseph\r\nBonaparte: \"Destiny seems to blind us, and intends, by means of our\r\nown faults, to restore France some day to her former rulers.\" [279]\r\n\r\nAt the very time of the scene at St. Cloud, fortune was preparing for\r\nthe First Consul another matrimonial trouble. His youngest brother,\r\nJerome, then aged nineteen years, had shown much aptitude for the\r\nFrench navy, and was serving on the American station, when a quarrel\r\nwith the admiral sent him flying in disgust to the shore. There, at\r\nBaltimore, he fell in love with Miss Paterson, the daughter of a\r\nwell-to-do merchant, and sought her hand in marriage. In vain did the\r\nFrench consul remind him that, were he five years older, he would\r\nstill need the consent of his mother. The headstrong nature of his\r\nrace brooked no opposition, and he secretly espoused the young lady at\r\nher father's residence.\r\n\r\n\r\nNapoleon's ire fell like a blasting wind on the young couple; but\r\nafter waiting some time, in hopes that the storm would blow over, they\r\nventured to come to Europe. Thereupon Napoleon wrote to Madame Mère in\r\nthese terms:\r\n\r\n     \"Jerome has arrived at Lisbon with the woman with whom he lives....\r\n     I have given orders that Miss Paterson is to be sent back to\r\n     America.... If he shows no inclination to wash away the dishonour\r\n     with which he has stained my name, by forsaking his country's flag\r\n     on land and sea for the sake of a wretched woman, I will cast him\r\n     off for ever.\"[280]\r\n\r\nThe sequel will show that Jerome was made of softer stuff than Lucien;\r\nand, strange to say, his compliance with Napoleon's dynastic designs\r\nprovided that family with the only legitimate male heirs that were\r\ndestined to sustain its wavering hopes to the end of the century.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE ROYALIST PLOT\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom domestic comedy, France turned rapidly in the early months of\r\n1804 to a sombre tragedy--the tragedy of the Georges Cadoudal plot and\r\nthe execution of the Duc d'Enghien.\r\n\r\nThere were varied reasons why the exiled French Bourbons should\r\ncompass the overthrow of Napoleon. Every month that they delayed\r\naction lessened their chances of success. They had long clung to the\r\nhope that his Concordat with the Pope and other anti-revolutionary\r\nmeasures betokened his intention to recall their dynasty. But in\r\nFebruary, 1803, the Comte de Provence received overtures which showed\r\nthat Bonaparte had never thought of playing the part of General Monk.\r\nThe exiled prince, then residing at Warsaw, was courteously but most\r\nfirmly urged by the First Consul to renounce both for himself and for\r\nthe other members of his House all claims to the throne of France, in\r\nreturn for which he would receive a pension of two million francs a\r\nyear. The notion of sinking to the level of a pensionary of the French\r\nRepublic touched Bourbon pride to the quick and provoked this spirited\r\nreply:\r\n\r\n     \"As a descendant of St. Louis, I shall endeavour to imitate his\r\n     example by respecting myself even in captivity. As successor to\r\n     Francis I., I shall at least aspire to say with him: 'We have lost\r\n     everything but our honour.\"'\r\n\r\nTo this declaration the Comte d'Artois, his son, the Duc de Berri,\r\nLouis Philippe of Orleans, his two sons, and the two Condés gave their\r\nardent assent; and the same loyal response came from the young Condé,\r\nthe Duc d'Enghien, dated Ettenheim, March 22nd, 1803. Little did men\r\nthink when they read this last defiance to Napoleon that within a year\r\nits author would be flung into a grave in the moat of the Castle of\r\nVincennes.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the echoes of the Bourbon retorts died away than the\r\noutbreak of war between England and France raised the hopes of the\r\nFrench royalist exiles in London; and their nimble fancy pictured the\r\nFrench army and nation as ready to fling themselves at the feet of\r\nLouis XVIII. The future monarch did not share these illusions. In the\r\nchilly solitudes of Warsaw he discerned matters in their true light,\r\nand prepared to wait until the vaulting ambition of Napoleon should\r\nleague Europe against him. Indeed, when the plans of the forward wing\r\nin London were explained to him, with a view of enlisting his support,\r\nhe deftly waved aside the embarrassing overtures by quoting the lines:\r\n\r\n                               \"Et pour être approuvés\r\n  De semblables projets veulent être achevés,\"\r\n\r\na cautious reply which led his brother, then at Edinburgh, scornfully\r\nto contemn his _feebleness_ as unworthy of any further confidences.[281]\r\nIn truth, the Comte d'Artois, destined one day to be Charles X. of\r\nFrance, was not fashioned by nature for a Fabian policy of delay: not\r\neven the misfortunes of exile could instill into the watertight\r\ncompartments of his brain the most elementary notions of prudence.\r\nDaring, however, attracts daring; and this prince had gathered around\r\nhim in our land the most desperate of the French royalists, whose hopes,\r\nhatreds, schemes, and unending requests for British money may be scanned\r\nby the curious in some thirty large volumes of letters bequeathed by\r\ntheir factotum the Comte de Puisaye, to the British Museum.\r\nUnfortunately this correspondence throws little light on the details of\r\nthe plot which is fitly called by the name of Georges Cadoudal.\r\n\r\nThis daring Breton was, in fact, the only man of action on whom the\r\nBourbon princes could firmly rely for an enterprise that demanded a\r\ncool head, cunning in the choice of means, and a remorseless hand.\r\nPichegru it is true, lived near London, but saw little of the\r\n_émigrés_, except the venerable Condé. Dumouriez also was in the great\r\ncity, but his name was too generally scorned in France for his\r\ntreachery in 1793 to warrant his being used. But there were plenty of\r\nswashbucklers who could prepare the ground in France, or, if fortune\r\nfavoured, might strike the blow themselves; and a small committee of\r\nFrench royalists, which had the support of that furious royalist, Mr.\r\nWindham, M.P., began even before the close of 1802 to discuss plans\r\nfor the \"removal\" of Bonaparte. Two of their tools, Picot and Le\r\nBourgeois by name, plunged blindly into a plot, and were arrested soon\r\nafter they set foot in France. Their boyish credulity seems to have\r\nsuggested to the French authorities the sending of an agent so as to\r\nentrap not only French _émigrés_, but also English officials and\r\nJacobinical generals.\r\n\r\nThe _agent provocateur_ has at all times been a favourite tool of\r\ncontinental Governments: but rarely has a more finished specimen of\r\nthe class been seen than Méhée de la Touche. After plying the trade of\r\nan assassin in the September massacres of 1792, and of a Jacobin spy\r\nduring the Terror, he had been included by Bonaparte among the Jacobin\r\nscapegoats who expiated the Chouan outrage of Nivôse. Pining in the\r\nweariness of exile, he heard from his wife that he might be pardoned\r\nif he would perform some service for the Consular Government. At once\r\nhe consented, and it was agreed that he should feign royalism, should\r\nworm himself into the secrets of the _émigrés_ at London, and act as\r\nintermediary between them and the discontented republicans of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe man who seems to have planned this scheme was the ex-Minister of\r\nPolice. Fouché had lately been deprived by Bonaparte of the\r\ninquisitorial powers which he so unscrupulously used. His duties were\r\ndivided between Régnier, the Grand Judge and Minister of Justice, and\r\nRéal, a Councillor of State, who watched over the internal security of\r\nFrance. These men had none of the ability of Fouché, nor did they know\r\nat the outset what Méhée was doing in London. It may, therefore, be\r\nassumed that Méhée was one of Fouché's creatures, whom he used to\r\ndiscredit his successor, and that Bonaparte welcomed this means of\r\nquickening the zeal of the official police, while he also wove his\r\nmeshes round plotting _émigrés_, English officials, and French\r\ngenerals.[282]\r\n\r\nAmong these last there was almost chronic discontent, and Bonaparte\r\nclaimed to have found out a plot whereby twelve of them should divide\r\nFrance into as many portions, leaving to him only Paris and its\r\nenvirons. If so, he never made any use of his discovery. In fact, out\r\nof this group of malcontents, Moreau, Bernadotte, Augereau, Macdonald,\r\nand others, he feared only the hostility of the first. The victor of\r\nHohenlinden lived in sullen privacy near to Paris, refusing to present\r\nhimself at the Consular Court, and showing his contempt for those who\r\ndonned a courtier's uniform. He openly mocked at the Concordat; and\r\nwhen the Legion of Honour was instituted, he bestowed a collar of\r\nhonour upon his dog. So keen was Napoleon's resentment at this\r\nraillery that he even proposed to send him a challenge to a duel in\r\nthe Bois de Boulogne.[283] The challenge, of course, was not sent; a\r\nshow of reconciliation was assumed between the two warriors; but\r\nNapoleon retained a covert dislike of the man whose brusque\r\nrepublicanism was applauded by a large portion of the army and by the\r\n_frondeurs_ of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe ruin of Moreau, and the confusion alike of French royalists and\r\nof the British Ministry, could now be assured by the encouragement of\r\na Jacobin-Royalist conspiracy, in which English officials should be\r\nimplicated. Moreau was notoriously incapable in the sphere of\r\npolitical intrigue: the royalist coteries in London presented just the\r\nmaterial on which the _agent provocateur_ delights to work; and some\r\nBritish officials could, doubtless, with equal ease be drawn into the\r\ntoils. Méhée de la Touche has left a highly spiced account of his\r\nadventures; but it must, of course, be received with distrust.[284]\r\n\r\nProceeding first to Guernsey, he gained the confidence of the\r\nGovernor, General Doyle; and, fortified by recommendations from him,\r\nhe presented himself to the _émigrés_ at London, and had an interview\r\nwith Lord Hawkesbury and the Under-Secretaries of State, Messrs.\r\nHammond and Yorke. He found it easy to inflame the imagination of the\r\nFrench exiles, who clutched at the proposed union between the\r\nirreconcilables, the extreme royalists, and the extreme republicans;\r\nand it was forthwith arranged that Napoleon's power, which rested on\r\nthe support of the peasants, in fact of the body of France, should be\r\ncrushed by an enveloping move of the tips of the wings.\r\n\r\nMéhée's narrative contains few details and dates, such as enable one\r\nto test his assertions. But I have examined the Puisaye Papers,[285]\r\nand also the Foreign and Home Office archives, and have found proofs\r\nof the complicity of our Government, which it will be well to present\r\nhere connectedly. Taken singly they are inconclusive, but collectively\r\ntheir importance is considerable. In our Foreign Office Records\r\n(France, No 70) there is a letter, dated London, August 30th, 1803,\r\nfrom the Baron de Roll, the factotum of the exiled Bourbons, to Mr.\r\nHammond, our Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office, asking\r\nhim to call on the Comte d'Artois at his residence, No. 46, Baker\r\nStreet. That the deliberations at that house were not wholly peaceful\r\nappears from a long secret memorandum of October 24th, 1803, in which\r\nthe Comte d'Artois reviews the career of \"that _miserable adventurer_\"\r\n(Bonaparte), so as to prove that his present position is precarious\r\nand tottering. He concludes by naming those who desired his\r\noverthrow--Moreau, Reynier, Bernadotte, Simon, Masséna, Lannes, and\r\nFérino: Sieyès, Carnot, Chénier, Fouché, Barras, Tallien, Rewbel,\r\nLamarque, and Jean de Bry. Others would not attack him \"corps à\r\ncorps,\" but disliked his supremacy. These two papers prove that our\r\nGovernment was aware of the Bourbon plot. Another document, dated\r\nLondon, November 18th, 1803, proves its active complicity. It is a\r\nlist of the French royalist officers \"who had set out or were ready to\r\nset out.\" All were in our pay, two at six shillings, five at four\r\nshillings, and nine at two shillings a day. It would be indelicate to\r\nreveal the names, but among them occurs that of Joachim P.J. Cadoudal.\r\nThe list is drawn up and signed by Frieding--a name that was\r\nfrequently used by Pichegru as an _alias_. In his handwriting also is\r\na list of \"royalist officers for whom I demand a year's pay in\r\nadvance\"--five generals, thirteen _chefs de légion_, seventeen _chefs\r\nde bataillon_, and nineteen captains. The pay claimed amounts to\r\n£3,110 15_s._[286] That some, at least, of our Admiralty officials\r\nalso aided Cadoudal is proved by a \"most secret\" letter, dated\r\nAdmiralty Office, July 31st, 1803, from E. N[epean] to Admiral Montagu\r\nin the Downs, charging him to help the bearer, Captain Wright, in the\r\nexecution of \"a very important service,\" and to provide for him \"one\r\nof the best of the hired cutters or luggers under your orders.\"\r\nAnother \"most secret\" Admiralty letter, of January 9th, 1804, orders a\r\nfrigate or large sloop to be got ready to convey secretly \"an officer\r\nof rank and consideration\" (probably Pichegru) to the French coast.\r\nWright carried over the conspirators in several parties, until chance\r\nthrew him into Napoleon's power and consigned him to an ignominious\r\ndeath, probably suicide.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is the letter of Mr. Arbuthnot, Parliamentary Secretary\r\nat the Foreign Office (dated March 12th, 1804), to Sir Arthur Paget,\r\nin which he refers to the \"sad result of all our fine projects for the\r\nre-establishment of the Bourbons: ... we are, of course, greatly\r\napprehensive for poor Moreau's safety.\"[287]\r\n\r\nIn face of this damning evidence the ministerial denials of complicity\r\nmust be swept aside.[288] It is possible, however, that the plot was\r\nconnived at, not by the more respectable chiefs, but by young and\r\nhot-headed officials. Even in the summer of 1803 that Cabinet was\r\nalready tottering under the attacks of the Whigs and the followers of\r\nPitt. The blandly respectable Addington and Hawkesbury with his\r\n\"vacant grin\"[289] were evidently no match for Napoleon; and\r\nArbuthnot himself dubs Addington \"a poor wretch universally despised\r\nand laught at,\" and pronounces the Cabinet \"the most inefficient that\r\never curst a country.\" I judge, therefore, that our official aid to\r\nthe conspirators was limited to the Under-Secretaries of the Foreign,\r\nWar, and Admiralty Offices. Moreover, the royalist plans, _as revealed\r\nto our officials_, mainly concerned a rising in Normandy and Brittany.\r\nOur Government would not have paid the salaries of fifty-four royalist\r\nofficers--many of them of good old French families--if it had been\r\nonly a question of stabbing Napoleon. The lists of those officers were\r\ndrawn up here in November, 1803, that is, three months after Georges\r\nCadoudal had set out for Normandy and Paris to collect his\r\ndesperadoes; and it seems most probable that the officers of the\r\n\"royal army\" were expected merely to clinch Cadoudal's enterprise by\r\nrekindling the flame of revolt in the north and west. French agents\r\nwere trying to do the same in Ireland, and a plot for the murder of\r\nGeorge III. was thought to have been connived at by the French\r\nauthorities. But, when all is said, the British Government must stand\r\naccused of one of the most heinous of crimes. The whole truth was not\r\nknown at Paris; but it was surmised; and the surmise was sufficient to\r\nenvenom the whole course of the struggle between England and Napoleon.\r\n\r\nHaving now established the responsibility of British officials in\r\nthis, the most famous plot of the century, we return to describe the\r\nprogress of the conspiracy and the arts employed by Napoleon to defeat\r\nit. His tool, Méhée de la Touche, after entrapping French royalists\r\nand some of our own officials in London, proceeded to the Continent in\r\norder to inveigle some of our envoys. He achieved a brilliant success.\r\nHe called at Munich, in order, as he speciously alleged, to arrange\r\nwith our ambassador there the preparations for the royalist plot. The\r\nBritish envoy, who bore the honoured name of Francis Drake, was a\r\nzealous intriguer closely in touch with the _émigrés_: he was\r\ncompletely won over by the arts of Méhée: he gave the spy money,\r\nsupplied him with a code of false names, and even intrusted him with a\r\nrecipe for sympathetic ink. Thus furnished, Méhée proceeded to Paris,\r\nsent his briber a few harmless bulletins, took his information to the\r\npolice, and, _at Napoleon's dictation_, gave him news that seriously\r\nmisled our Government and Nelson.[290]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same trick was tried on Stuart, our ambassador at Vienna, who had\r\na tempting offer from a French agent to furnish news from every French\r\ndespatch to or from Vienna. Stuart had closed with the offer, when\r\nsuddenly the man was seized at the instance of the French ambassador,\r\nand his papers were searched.[291] In this case there were none that\r\ncompromised Stuart, and his career was not cut short in the\r\nignominious manner that befell Drake, over whom there may be inscribed\r\nas epitaph the warning which Talleyrand gave to young aspirants--\"et\r\nsurtout pas trop de zèle.\"\r\n\r\nThus, while the royalists were conspiring the overthrow of Napoleon,\r\nhe through his agents was countermining their clumsy approach to his\r\ncitadel, and prepared to blow them sky high when their mines were\r\ncrowded for the final rush. The royalist plans matured slowly owing to\r\nchanges which need not be noticed. Georges Cadoudal quitted London,\r\nand landed at Biville, a smuggler's haunt not far from Dieppe, on\r\nAugust 23rd, 1803. Thence he made his way to Paris, and spent some\r\nmonths in striving to enlist trusty recruits. It has been stated that\r\nthe plot never aimed at assassination, but at the overpowering of the\r\nFirst Consul's escort, and the seizure of his person, during one of\r\nhis journeys. Then he was to be forcibly transferred to the northern\r\ncoast on relays of horses, and hurried over to England.[292] But,\r\nthough the plotters threw the veil of decency over their enterprise by\r\ncalling it kidnapping, they undoubtedly meant murder. Among Drake's\r\npapers there is a hint that the royalist emissaries were _at first_ to\r\nspeak only of the seizure and deportation of the First Consul.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been their precise aims, they were certainly known\r\nto Napoleon and his police. On November 1st, 1803, he wrote to\r\nRégnier:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"You must not be in a hurry about the arrests: when the author\r\n     [Méhée] has given in all the information, we will draw up a plan\r\n     with him, and will see what is to be done. I wish him to write to\r\n     Drake, and, in order to make him trustful, inform him that, before\r\n     the great blow can be dealt, he believes he [Méhée] can promise to\r\n     have seized on the table of the First Consul, in his secret room,\r\n     notes written in his own hand relating to his great expedition,\r\n     and every other important document.\"\r\n\r\nNapoleon revelled in the details of his plan for hoisting the\r\nengineers with their own petards.[293] But he knew full well that the\r\nplot, when fully ripe, would yield far more than the capture of a few\r\nChouans. He must wait until Moreau was implicated. The man selected by\r\nthe _émigrés_ to sound Moreau was Pichegru, and this choice was the\r\nsole instance of common sense displayed by them. It was Pichegru who\r\nhad marked out the future fortune of Moreau in the campaign of 1793,\r\nand yet he had seemed to be the victim of that general's gross\r\ningratitude at Fructidor. Who then so fitted as he to approach the\r\nvictor of Hohenlinden? Through a priest named David and General\r\nLajolais, an interview was arranged; and shortly after Pichegru's\r\narrival in France, these warriors furtively clasped hands in the\r\ncapital which had so often resounded with their praises (January,\r\n1804). They met three or four times, and cleared away some of the\r\nmisunderstandings of the past. But he would have nothing to do with\r\nGeorges, and when Pichegru mooted the overthrow of Bonaparte and the\r\nrestoration of the Bourbons, he firmly warned him: \"Do with Bonaparte\r\nwhat you will, but do not ask me to put a Bourbon in his place.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this resolve Moreau never receded. But his calculating reserve did\r\nnot save him. Already several suspects had been imprisoned in Normandy.\r\nAt Napoleon's suggestion five of them were condemned to death, in the\r\nhope of extorting a confession; and the last a man named Querelle,\r\ngratified his gaolers by revealing (February 14th) not only the lodging\r\nof Georges in Paris, but the intention of other conspirators, among whom\r\nwas a French prince, to land at Biville. The plot was now coming to a\r\nhead, and so was the counter-plot. On the next day Moreau was arrested\r\nby order of Napoleon, who feigned the utmost grief and surprise at\r\nseeing the victor of Hohenlinden mixed up with royalist assassins in the\r\npay of England.[294]\r\n\r\nElated by this success, and hoping to catch the Comte d'Artois\r\nhimself, Napoleon forthwith despatched to that cliff one of his most\r\ncrafty and devoted servants, Savary, who commanded the _gendarmerie\r\nd'élite._ Tricked out in suitable disguises, and informed by a\r\nsmuggler as to the royalist signals, Savary eagerly awaited the royal\r\nquarry, and when Captain Wright's vessel hove in sight, he used his\r\nutmost arts to imitate the signals that invited a landing. But the\r\ncrew were not to be lured to shore; and after fruitless endeavours he\r\nreturned to Paris--in time to take part in the murder of the Duc\r\nd'Enghien.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the police were on the tracks of Pichegru and Georges. On\r\nthe last day of February the general was seized in bed in the house of\r\na treacherous friend: but not until the gates of Paris had been\r\nclosed, and domiciliary visits made, was Georges taken, and then only\r\nafter a desperate affray (March 9th). The arrest of the two Polignacs\r\nand the Marquis de Rivière speedily followed.\r\n\r\nHitherto Napoleon had completely outwitted his foes. He knew well\r\nenough that he was in no danger.\r\n\r\n    \"I have run no real risks,\" he wrote to Melzi, \"for the police had\r\n    its eyes on all these machinations, and I have the consolation of\r\n    not finding reason to complain of a single man among all those I\r\n    have placed in this huge administration, Moreau stands alone.\"\r\n    [295]\r\n\r\nBut now, at the moment of victory, when France was swelling with rage\r\nagainst royalist assassins, English gold, and Moreau's treachery, the\r\nFirst Consul was hurried into an enterprise which gained him an\r\nimperial crown and flecked the purple with innocent blood.\r\n\r\nThere was living at Ettenheim, in Baden, not far from the Rhine, a\r\nyoung prince of the House of Condé, the Duc d'Enghien. Since the\r\ndisbanding of the corps of Condé he had been tranquilly enjoying the\r\nsociety of the Princess Charlotte de Rohan, to whom he had been\r\nsecretly married. Her charms, the attractions of the chase, the\r\nsociety of a small circle of French _émigrés_, and an occasional\r\nsecret visit to the theatre at Strassburg, formed the chief diversions\r\nto an otherwise monotonous life, until he was fired with the hope of a\r\nspeedy declaration of war by Austria and Russia against Napoleon.\r\nReport accused him of having indiscreetly ventured in disguise far\r\ninto France; but he indignantly denied it. His other letters also\r\nprove that he was not an accomplice of the Cadoudal-Pichegru\r\nconspiracy. But Napoleon's spies gave information which seemed to\r\nimplicate him in that enterprise. Chief among them was Méhée, who, at\r\nthe close of February, hovered about Ettenheim and heard that the duke\r\nwas often absent for many days at a time.\r\n\r\nNapoleon received this news on March 1st, and ordered the closest\r\ninvestigation to be made. One of his spies reported that the young\r\nduke associated with General Dumouriez. In reality the general was in\r\nLondon, and the spy had substituted the name of a harmless old\r\ngentleman called Thumery. When Napoleon saw the name of Dumouriez with\r\nthat of the young duke his rage knew no bounds. \"Am I a dog to be\r\nbeaten to death in the street? Why was I not warned that they were\r\nassembling at Ettenheim? Are my murderers sacred beings? They attack my\r\nvery person. I'll give them war for war.\" And he overwhelmed with\r\nreproaches both Réal and Talleyrand for neglecting to warn him of these\r\ntraitors and assassins clustering on the banks of the Rhine. The seizure\r\nof Georges Cadoudal and the examination of one of his servants helped to\r\nconfirm Napoleon's surmise that he was the victim of a plot of which the\r\nduke and Dumouriez were the real contrivers, while Georges was their\r\ntool. Cadoudal's servant stated that there often came to his master's\r\nhouse a mysterious man, at whose entry not only Georges but also the\r\nPolignacs and Rivière always arose. This convinced Napoleon that the Duc\r\nd'Enghien was directing the plot, and he determined to have the duke and\r\nDumouriez seized. That they were on German soil was naught to him.\r\nTalleyrand promised that he could soon prevail on the Elector to\r\noverlook this violation of his territory, and the question was then\r\ndiscussed in an informal council. Talleyrand, Réal, and Fouché advised\r\nthe severest measures. Lebrun spoke of the outcry which such a violation\r\nof neutral territory would arouse, but bent before the determination of\r\nthe First Consul; and the regicide Cambacérès alone offered a firm\r\nopposition to an outrage which must embroil France with Germany and\r\nRussia. Despite this protest, Napoleon issued his orders and then\r\nrepaired to the pleasing solitudes of La Malmaison, where he remained in\r\nalmost complete seclusion. The execution of the orders was now left to\r\nGenerals Ordener and Caulaincourt, who arranged the raid into Baden; to\r\nMurat, who was now Governor of Paris; and to the devoted and\r\nunquestioning Savary and Réal.\r\n\r\nThe seizure of the duke was craftily effected. Troops and gendarmes\r\nwere quietly mustered at Strassburg: spies were sent forward to survey\r\nthe ground; and as the dawn of the 15th of March was lighting up the\r\neastern sky, thirty Frenchmen encircled Enghien's abode. His hot blood\r\nprompted him to fight, but on the advice of a friend he quietly\r\nsurrendered, was haled away to Strassburg, and thence to the castle of\r\nVincennes on the south-east of Paris. There everything was ready for\r\nhis reception on the evening of March 20th. The pall of secrecy was\r\nspread over the preparations. The name of Plessis was assigned to the\r\nvictim, and Harel, the governor of the castle, was left ignorant of\r\nhis rank.[296]\r\n\r\nAbove all, he was to be tried by a court-martial of officers, a form\r\nof judgment which was summary and without appeal; whereas the ordinary\r\ncourts of justice must be slow and open to the public gaze. It was\r\ntrue that the Senate had just suspended trial by jury in the case of\r\nattempts against the First Consul's life--a device adopted in view of\r\nthe Moreau prosecution. But the certainty of a conviction was not\r\nenough: Napoleon determined to strike terror into his enemies, such as\r\na swift and secret blow always inspires. He had resolved on a trial by\r\ncourt-martial when he still believed Enghien to be an accomplice of\r\nDumouriez; and when, late on Saturday, March 17th, that mistake was\r\nexplained, his purpose remained unshaken--unshaken too by the high\r\nmass of Easter Sunday, March 18th, which he heard in state at the\r\nChapel of the Tuileries. On the return journey to Malmaison Josephine\r\nconfessed to Madame de Rémusat her fears that Bonaparte's will was\r\nunalterably fixed: \"I have done what I could, but I fear his mind is\r\nmade up.\" She and Joseph approached him once more in the park while\r\nTalleyrand was at his side. \"I fear that cripple,\" she said, as they\r\ncame near, and Joseph drew the Minister aside. All was in vain. \"Go\r\naway; you are a child; you don't understand public duties.\" This was\r\nJosephine's final repulse.\r\n\r\nOn March 20th Napoleon drew up the form of questions to be put to the\r\nprisoner. He now shifted the ground of accusation. Out of eleven\r\nquestions only the last three referred to the duke's connection with\r\nthe Cadoudal plot.[297] For in the meantime he had found in the\r\nduke's papers proofs of his having offered his services to the\r\nBritish Government for the present war,[298] his hopes of\r\nparticipation in a future Continental war, but nothing that could\r\nimplicate him in the Cadoudal plot. The papers were certainly\r\ndisappointing; and that is doubtless the reason why, after examining\r\nthem on March 19th, he charged Réal \"to take secret cognizance of\r\nthese papers, along with Desmarest. One must prevent any talk on the\r\nmore or less of charges contained in these papers.\" The same fact\r\ndoubtless led to their abstraction along with the _dossier_ of the\r\nproceedings of the court-martial.[299]\r\n\r\nThe task of summoning the officers who were to form the court-martial\r\nwas imposed on Murat. But when this bluff, hearty soldier received\r\nthis order, he exclaimed: \"What! are they trying to soil my uniform! I\r\nwill not allow it! Let him appoint them himself if he wants to.\" But a\r\nsecond and more imperious mandate compelled him to perform this\r\nhateful duty. The seven senior officers of the garrison of Paris now\r\nsummoned were ordered not to separate until judgment was passed.[300]\r\nAt their head was General Hulin, who had shown such daring in the\r\nassault on the Bastille; and thus one of the early heroes of the\r\nRevolution had the evening of his days shrouded over with the horrors\r\nof a midnight murder. Finally, the First Consul charged Savary, who\r\nhad just returned to Paris from Biville, furious at being baulked of\r\nhis prey, to proceed to Vincennes with a band of his gendarmes for the\r\ncarrying out of the sentence.\r\n\r\nThe seven officers as yet knew nothing of the nature of their mission,\r\nor of martial law. \"We had not,\" wrote Hulin long afterwards, \"the least\r\nidea about trials; and, worst of all, the reporter and clerk had\r\nscarcely any more experience.\"[301] The examination of the prisoner was\r\ncurt in the extreme. He was asked his name, date and place of birth,\r\nwhether he had borne arms against France and was in the pay of England.\r\nTo the last questions he answered decisively in the affirmative, adding\r\nthat he wished to take part in the new war against France.\r\n\r\nHis replies were the same as he made in his preliminary examination,\r\nwhich he closed with the written and urgent request for a personal\r\ninterview with Napoleon. To this request the court proposed to accede;\r\nbut Savary, who had posted himself behind Hulin's chair, at once\r\ndeclared this step to be _inopportune_. The judges had only one chance\r\nof escape from their predicament, namely, to induce the duke to\r\ninvalidate his evidence: this he firmly refused to do, and when Hulin\r\nwarned him of the danger of his position, he replied that he knew it,\r\nand wished to have an interview with the First Consul.\r\n\r\nThe court then passed sentence, and, \"in accordance with article\r\n(blank) of the law (blank) to the following effect (blank) condemned\r\nhim to suffer death.\" Ashamed, as it would seem, of this clumsy\r\ncondemnation, Hulin was writing to Bonaparte to request for the\r\ncondemned man the personal interview which he craved, when Savary took\r\nthe pen from his hands, with the words: \"Your work is done: the rest\r\nis my business.\"[302] The duke was forthwith led out into the moat of\r\nthe castle, where a few torches shed their light on the final scene of\r\nthis sombre tragedy: he asked for a priest, but this was denied him:\r\nhe then bowed his head in prayer, lifted those noble features towards\r\nthe soldiers, begged them not to miss their aim, and fell, shot\r\nthrough the heart. Hard by was a grave, which, in accordance with\r\norders received on the previous day, the governor had caused to be\r\nmade ready; into this the body was thrown pell-mell, and the earth\r\nclosed over the remains of the last scion of the warlike House of\r\nCondé.\r\n\r\nTwelve years later loving hands disinterred the bones and placed them\r\nin the chapel of the castle. But even then the world knew not all the\r\nenormity of the crime. It was reserved for clumsy apologists like\r\nSavary to provoke replies and further investigations. The various\r\nexcuses which throw the blame on Talleyrand, and on everyone but the\r\nchief actor, are sufficiently disposed of by the ex-Emperor's will. In\r\nthat document Napoleon brushed away the excuses which had previously\r\nbeen offered to the credulity or malice of his courtiers, and took on\r\nhimself the responsibility for the execution:\r\n\r\n     \"I caused the Duc d'Enghien to be arrested and judged, because it\r\n     was necessary for the safety, the interest, and the honour of the\r\n     French people when the Comte d'Artois, by his own confession, was\r\n     supporting sixty assassins at Paris. In similar circumstances I\r\n     would act in the same way again.\"[303]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe execution of the Duc d'Enghien is one of the most important\r\nincidents of this period, so crowded with momentous events. The\r\nsensation of horror which it caused can be gauged by the mental agony\r\nof Madame de Rémusat and of others who had hitherto looked on\r\nBonaparte as the hero of the age and the saviour of the country. His\r\nmother hotly upbraided him, saying it was an atrocious act, the stain\r\nof which could never be wiped out, and that he had yielded to the\r\nadvice of enemies' eager to tarnish his fame.[304] Napoleon said\r\nnothing, but shut himself up in his cabinet, revolving these terrible\r\nwords, which doubtless bore fruit in the bitter reproaches later to be\r\nheaped upon Talleyrand for his share in the tragedy. Many royalists\r\nwho had begun to rally to his side now showed their indignation at the\r\ndeed. Chateaubriand, who was about to proceed as the envoy of France\r\nto the Republic of Valais, at once offered his resignation and assumed\r\nan attitude of covert defiance. And that was the conduct of all\r\nroyalists who were not dazzled by the glamour of success or cajoled by\r\nNapoleon's favours. Many of his friends ventured to show their horror\r\nof this Corsican vendetta; and a _mot_ which was plausibly, but it\r\nseems wrongly, attributed to Fouché, well sums up the general opinion\r\nof that callous society: \"It was worse than a crime--it was a\r\nblunder.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had Paris recovered from this sensation when, on April 6th,\r\nPichegru was found strangled in prison; and men silently but almost\r\nunanimously hailed it as the work of Napoleon's Mamelukes. This\r\njudgment, however natural after the Enghien affair, seems to be\r\nincorrect. It is true the corpse bore marks which scarcely tallied with\r\nsuicide: but Georges Cadoudal, whose cell was hard by, heard no sound of\r\na scuffle; and it is unlikely that so strong a man as Pichegru would\r\neasily have succumbed to assailants. It is therefore more probable that\r\nthe conqueror of Holland, shattered by his misfortunes and too proud to\r\nundergo a public trial, cut short a life which already was doomed. Never\r\nhave plotters failed more ignominiously and played more completely into\r\nthe hands of their enemy. A _mot_ of the Boulevards wittily sums up the\r\nresults of their puny efforts: \"They came to France to give her a king,\r\nand they gave her an Emperor.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE DAWN OF THE EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some time the question of a Napoleonic dynasty had been freely\r\ndiscussed; and the First Consul himself had latterly confessed his\r\nintentions to Joseph in words that reveal his super-human confidence\r\nand his caution: \"I always intended to end the Revolution by the\r\nestablishment of heredity: but I thought that such a step could not be\r\ntaken before the lapse of five or six years.\" Events, however, bore\r\nhim along on a favouring tide. Hatred of England, fear of Jacobin\r\nexcesses, indignation at the royalist schemes against his life, and\r\nfinally even the execution of Enghien, helped on the establishment of\r\nthe Empire. Though moderate men of all parties condemned the murder,\r\nthe remnants of the Jacobin party hailed it with joy. Up to this time\r\nthey had a lingering fear that the First Consul was about to play the\r\npart of Monk. The pomp of the Tuileries and the hated Concordat seemed\r\nto their crooked minds but the prelude to a recall of the Bourbons,\r\nwhereupon priestcraft, tithes, and feudalism would be the order of the\r\nday. Now at last the tragedy of Vincennes threw a lurid light into the\r\nrecesses of Napoleon's ambition; and they exclaimed, \"He is one of\r\nus.\" It must thenceforth be war to the knife between the Bourbons and\r\nBonaparte; and his rule would therefore be the best guarantee for the\r\nperpetual ownership of the lands confiscated during the\r\nRevolution.[305]\r\n\r\nTo a materialized society that great event had come to be little more\r\nthan a big land investment syndicate, of which Bonaparte was now to be\r\nthe sole and perpetual director. This is the inner meaning of the\r\nreferences to the Social Contract which figure so oddly among the\r\npetitions for hereditary rule. The Jacobins, except a few conscientious\r\nstalwarts, were especially alert in the feat of making extremes meet.\r\nFouché, who now wriggled back into favour and office, appealed to the\r\nSenate, only seven days after the execution, to establish hereditary\r\npower as the only means of ending the plots against Napoleon's life;\r\nfor, as the opportunist Jacobins argued, if the hereditary system were\r\nadopted, conspiracies to murder would be meaningless, when, even if they\r\nstruck down one man, they must fail to shatter the system that\r\nguaranteed the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe cue having been thus dextrously given, appeals and petitions for\r\nhereditary rule began to pour in from all parts of France. The grand\r\nwork of the reorganization of France certainly furnished a solid claim\r\non the nation's gratitude. The recent promulgation of the Civil Code\r\nand the revival of material prosperity redounded to Napoleon's glory;\r\nand with equal truth and wit he could claim the diadem as a fit reward\r\n_for having revived many interests while none had been displaced._\r\nSuch a remark and such an exploit proclaim the born ruler of men. But\r\nthe Senate overstepped all bounds of decency when it thus addressed\r\nhim: \"You are founding a new era: but you ought to make it last for\r\never: splendour is nothing without duration.\" The Greeks who fawned on\r\nPersian satraps did not more unman themselves than these pensioned\r\nsycophants, who had lived through the days of 1789 but knew them not.\r\nThis fulsome adulation would be unworthy of notice did it not convey\r\nthe most signal proof of the danger which republics incur when men\r\nlose sight of the higher aims of life and wallow among its sordid\r\ninterests.[306]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the severe drilling of the last four years, the Chambers voted\r\nnearly unanimously in favour of a Napoleonic dynasty. The Corps\r\nLégislatif was not in session, and it was not convoked. The Senate,\r\nafter hearing Fouché's unmistakable hints, named a commission of its\r\nmembers to report on hereditary rule, and then waited on events. These\r\nwere decided mainly in private meetings of the Council of State, where\r\nthe proposal met with some opposition from Cambacérès, Merlin, and\r\nThibaudeau. But of what avail are private remonstrances when in open\r\nsession opponents are dumb and supporters vie in adulation? In the\r\nTribunate, on April 23rd, an obscure member named Curée proposed the\r\nadoption of the hereditary principle. One man alone dared openly to\r\ncombat the proposal, the great Carnot; and the opposition of Curée to\r\nCarnot might have recalled to the minds of those abject champions of\r\npopular liberty the verse that glitters amidst the literary rubbish of\r\nthe Roman Empire:\r\n\r\n  \"Victrix causa deis placuit, sed victa Catoni.\"\r\n\r\nThe Tribunate named a commission to report; it was favourable to the\r\nBonapartes. The Senate voted in the same sense, three Senators alone,\r\namong them Grégoire, Bishop of Blois, voting against it. Sieyès and\r\nLanjuinais were absent; but the well-salaried lord of the manor of\r\nCrosne must have read with amused contempt the resolution of this\r\nbody, which he had designed to be the _guardian of the republican\r\nconstitution_:\r\n\r\n     \"The French have conquered liberty: they wish to preserve their\r\n     conquest: they wish for repose after victory. They will owe this\r\n     glorious repose to the hereditary rule of a single man, who, raised\r\n     above all, is to defend public liberty, maintain equality, and\r\n     lower his fasces before the sovereignty of the people that\r\n     proclaims him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this way did France reduce to practice the dogma of Rousseau with\r\nregard to the occasional and temporary need of a dictator.[307]\r\n\r\nWhen the commonalty are so obsequious, any title can be taken by the\r\none necessary man. Napoleon at first affected to doubt whether the\r\ntitle of Stadtholder would not be more seemly than that of Emperor;\r\nand in one of the many conferences held on this topic, Miot de Melito\r\nadvocated the retention of the term Consul for its grand republican\r\nsimplicity. But it was soon seen that the term Emperor was the only\r\none which satisfied Napoleon's ambition and French love of splendour.\r\nAccordingly a _senatus consultum_ of May 18th, 1804, formally decreed\r\nto him the title of Emperor of the French. As for his former\r\ncolleagues, Cambacérès and Lebrun, they were stultified with the\r\ntitles of Arch-chancellor and Arch-treasurer of the Empire: his\r\nbrother Joseph received the title of Grand Elector, borrowed from the\r\nHoly Roman Empire, and oddly applied to an hereditary empire where the\r\nchief _had_ been appointed: Louis was dubbed Constable: two other\r\ngrand dignities, those of Arch-chancellor of State and High Admiral,\r\nwere not as yet filled, but were reserved for Napoleon's relatives by\r\nmarriage, Eugène Beauharnais and Murat. These six grand dignitaries of\r\nthe new Empire were to be irresponsible and irremovable, and, along\r\nwith the Emperor, they formed the Grand Council of the Empire.\r\n\r\nOn lesser individuals the rays of the imperial diadem cast a fainter\r\nglow. Napoleon's uncle, Cardinal Fesch, became Grand Almoner;\r\nBerthier, Grand Master of the Hounds; Talleyrand, Grand Chamberlain;\r\nDuroc, Grand Marshal of the Palace; and Caulaincourt, Master of the\r\nHorse, the acceptance of which title seemed to the world to convict\r\nhim of full complicity in the schemes for the murder of the Duc\r\nd'Enghien. For the rest, the Emperor's mother was to be styled _Madame\r\nMère_; his sisters became Imperial Highnesses, with their several\r\nestablishments of ladies-in-waiting; and Paris fluttered with excitement\r\nat each successive step upwards of expectant nobles, regicides,\r\ngenerals, and stockjobbers towards the central galaxy of the Corsican\r\nfamily, which, ten years before, had subsisted on the alms of the\r\nRepublic one and indivisible.\r\n\r\nIt remained to gain over the army. The means used were profuse, in\r\nproportion as the task was arduous. The following generals were\r\ndistinguished as Marshals of the Empire (May 19th): Berthier, Murat,\r\nMasséna, Augereau, Lannes, Jourdan, Ney, Soult, Brune, Davoust,\r\nBessières, Moncey, Mortier, and Bernadotte; two marshal's bâtons were\r\nheld in reserve as a reward for future service, and four aged\r\ngenerals, Lefebvre, Serrurier, Pérignon, and Kellerman (the hero of\r\nValmy), received the title of honorary marshals. In one of his\r\nconversations with Roederer, the Emperor frankly avowed his reasons\r\nfor showering these honours on his military chiefs; it was in order to\r\nassure the imperial dignity to himself; for how could they object to\r\nthis, when they themselves received honours so lofty?[308] The\r\nconfession affords a curious instance of Napoleon's unbounded trust\r\nin the most elementary, not to say the meanest, motives of human\r\nconduct. Suitable rewards were bestowed on officers of the second\r\nrank. But it was at once remarked that determined and outspoken\r\nrepublicans like Suchet, Gouvion St. Cyr, and Macdonald, whose talents\r\nand exploits far outstripped those of many of the marshals, were\r\nexcluded from their ranks. St. Cyr was at Taranto, and Macdonald,\r\nafter an enforced diplomatic mission to Copenhagen, was received on\r\nhis recall with much coolness.[309] Other generals who had given\r\numbrage at the Tuileries were more effectively broken in by a term of\r\ndiplomatic banishment. Lannes at Lisbon and Brune at Constantinople\r\nlearnt a little diplomacy and some complaisance to the head of the\r\nState, and were taken back to Napoleon's favour. Bernadotte, though ever\r\nsuspected of Jacobinism and feared for the forceful ambition that sprang\r\nfrom the blending of Gascon and Moorish blood in his veins, was now also\r\ntreated with the consideration due to one who had married Joseph\r\nBonaparte's sister-in-law: he received at Napoleon's hands the house in\r\nParis which had formerly belonged to Moreau: the exile's estate of\r\nGrosbois, near Paris, went to reward the ever faithful Berthier.\r\nAugereau, half cured of his Jacobinism by the disfavour of the\r\nDirectory, was now drilling a small French force and Irish volunteers at\r\nBrest. But the Grand Army, which comprised the pick of the French\r\nforces, was intrusted to the command of men on whom Napoleon could\r\nabsolutely rely, Davoust, Soult, and Ney; and, in that splendid force,\r\nhatred of England and pride in Napoleon's prowess now overwhelmed all\r\npolitical considerations.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements attest the marvellous foresight and care which\r\nNapoleon brought to bear on all affairs: even if the discontented\r\ngenerals and troops had protested against the adoption of the Empire\r\nand the prosecution of Moreau, they must have been easily overpowered.\r\nIn some places, as at Metz, the troops and populace fretted against\r\nthe Empire and its pretentious pomp; but the action of the commanders\r\nsoon restored order. And thus it came to pass that even the soldiery\r\nthat still cherished the Republic raised not a musket while the Empire\r\nwas founded, and Moreau was accused of high treason.\r\n\r\nThe record of the French revolutionary generals is in the main a\r\ngloomy one. If in 1795 it had been prophesied that all those generals\r\nwho bore the tricolour to victory would vanish or bow their heads\r\nbefore a Corsican, the prophet would speedily have closed his\r\ncroakings for ever. Yet the reality was even worse. Marceau and Hoche\r\ndied in the Rhineland: Kléber and Desaix fell on the same day, by\r\nassassination and in battle: Richepanse, Leclerc, and many other brave\r\nofficers rotted away in San Domingo: Pichegru died a violent death in\r\nprison: Carnot was retiring into voluntary exile: Masséna and\r\nMacdonald were vegetating in inglorious ease: others were fast\r\ndescending to the rank of flunkeys; and Moreau was on his trial for\r\nhigh treason.\r\n\r\nEven the populace, dazzled with glitter and drunk with sensations,\r\nsuffered some qualms at seeing the victor of Hohenlinden placed in the\r\ndock; and the grief of the scanty survivors of the Army of the Rhine\r\nportended trouble if the forms of justice were too much strained.\r\nTrial by jury had been recently dispensed with in cases that concerned\r\nthe life of Napoleon. Consequently the prisoner, along with Georges\r\nand his confederates, could be safely arraigned before judges in open\r\ncourt; and in that respect the trial contrasted with the midnight\r\ncourt-martial of Vincennes. Yet in no State trial have judges been\r\nsubjected to more official pressure for the purpose of assuring a\r\nconviction.[310] The cross examination of numerous witnesses proved\r\nthat Moreau had persistently refused his help to the plot; and the\r\nutmost that could be urged against him was that he desired Napoleon's\r\noverthrow, had three interviews with Pichegru, and did not reveal the\r\nplot to the authorities. That is to say, he was guilty of passively\r\nconniving at the success of a plot which a \"good citizen\" ought to\r\nhave denounced.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons the judges sentenced him to two years'\r\nimprisonment. This judgment excessively annoyed Napoleon, who desired\r\nto use his imperial prerogative of pardon on Moreau's life, not on a\r\nmere term of imprisonment; and with a show of clemency that veiled a\r\nhidden irritation, he now released him provided that he retired to the\r\nUnited States.[311] To that land of free men the victor of Hohenlinden\r\nretired with a dignity which almost threw a veil over his past\r\nincapacity and folly; and, for the present at least, men could say that\r\nthe end of his political career was nobler than Pompey's, while\r\nNapoleon's conduct towards his rival lacked the clemency which graced\r\nthe triumph of Cæsar.\r\n\r\nAs for the actual conspirators, twenty of them were sentenced to death\r\non June 10th, among them being the elder of the two Polignacs, the\r\nMarquis de Rivière, and Georges Cadoudal. Urgent efforts were made on\r\nbehalf of the nobles by Josephine and \"Madame Mère\"; and Napoleon\r\ngrudgingly commuted their sentence to imprisonment. But the plebeian,\r\nGeorges Cadoudal, suffered death for the cause that had enlisted all\r\nthe fierce energies of his youth and manhood. With him perished the\r\nbravest of Bretons and the last man of action of the royalists.\r\nThenceforth Napoleon was not troubled by Bourbon plotters; and\r\ndoubtless the skill with which his agents had nursed this silly plot\r\nand sought to entangle all waverers did far more than the strokes of\r\nthe guillotine to procure his future immunity. Men trembled before a\r\nunion of immeasurable power with unfathomable craft such as recalled\r\nthe days of the Emperor Tiberius.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Napoleon might now almost say that his chief foes were the\r\nmembers of his own household. The question of hereditary succession\r\nhad already reawakened and intensified all the fierce passions of the\r\nEmperor's relatives. Josephine saw in it the fatal eclipse of a\r\ndivorce sweeping towards the dazzling field of her new life, and\r\nNapoleon is known to have thrice almost decided on this step. She no\r\nlonger had any hopes of bearing a child; and she is reported by the\r\ncompiler of the Fouché \"Memoirs\" to have clutched at that absurd\r\ndevice, a supposititious child, which Fouché had taken care to\r\nridicule in advance. Whatever be the truth of this rumour, she\r\ncertainly used all her powers over Napoleon and over\r\nher daughter Hortense, the spouse of Louis Bonaparte, to have their\r\nson recognized as first in the line of direct succession. But this\r\nproposal, which shelved both Joseph and Louis, was not only hotly\r\nresented by the eldest brother, who claimed to be successor designate,\r\nit also aroused the flames of jealousy in Louis himself. It was\r\nnotorious that he suspected Napoleon of an incestuous passion for\r\nHortense, of which his fondness for the little Charles Napoleon was\r\nmaliciously urged as proof; and the proposal, when made with trembling\r\neagerness by Josephine, was hurled back by Louis with brutal violence.\r\nTo the clamour of Louis and Joseph the Emperor and Josephine seemed\r\nreluctantly to yield.\r\n\r\nNew arrangements were accordingly proposed. Lucien and Jerome having,\r\nfor the present at least, put themselves out of court by their\r\nunsatisfactory marriages, Napoleon appeared to accept a reconciliation\r\nwith Joseph and Louis, and to place them in the order of succession,\r\nas the Senate recommended. But he still reserved the right of adopting\r\nthe son of Louis and of thus favouring his chances of priority.\r\nIndeed, it must be admitted that the Emperor at this difficult crisis\r\nshowed conjugal tact and affection, for which he has received scant\r\njustice at the hands of Josephine's champions. \"How could I divorce\r\nthis good wife,\" he said to Roederer, \"because I am becoming great?\"\r\nBut fate seemed to decree the divorce, which, despite the reasonings\r\nof his brothers, he resolutely thrust aside; for the little boy on\r\nwhose life the Empress built so many fond hopes was to be cut off by\r\nan early death in the year 1807.\r\n\r\nThen there were frequent disputes between Napoleon and Joseph. Both of\r\nthem had the Corsican's instinct in favour of primogeniture; and\r\nhitherto Napoleon had in many ways deferred to his elder brother. Now,\r\nhowever, he showed clearly that he would brook not the slightest\r\ninterference in affairs of State. And truly, if we except Joseph's\r\ndiplomatic services, he showed no commanding gifts such as could raise\r\nhim aloft along with the bewildering rush of Napoleon's fortunes. The\r\none was an irrepressible genius, the other was a man of culture and\r\ntalent, whose chief bent was towards literature, amours, and the art\r\nof _dolce far niente_, except when his pride was touched: then he was\r\ncapable of bursts of passion which seemed to impose even on his\r\nmasterful second brother. Lucien, Louis, and even the youthful Jerome,\r\nhad the same intractable pride which rose defiant even against\r\nNapoleon. He was determined that his brothers should now take a\r\nsubordinate rank, while they regarded the dynasty as largely due to\r\ntheir exertions at or after Brumaire, and claimed a proportionate\r\nreward. Napoleon, however, saw that a dynasty could not thus be\r\nfounded. As he frankly said to Roederer, a dynasty could only take\r\nfirm root in France among heirs brought up in a palace: \"I have never\r\nlooked on my brothers as the natural heirs to power: I only consider\r\nthem as men fit to ward off the evils of a minority.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph deeply resented this conduct. He was a Prince of the Empire,\r\nand a Grand Elector; but he speedily found out that this meant nothing\r\nmore than occasionally presiding at the Senate, and accordingly\r\nindulged in little acts of opposition that enraged the autocrat. In\r\nhis desire to get his brother away from Paris, the Emperor had already\r\nrecommended him to take up the profession of arms; for he could not\r\ninclude him in the succession, and place famous marshals under him if\r\nhe knew nothing of an army. Joseph perforce accepted the command of a\r\nregiment, and at thirty-six years of age began to learn drill near\r\nBoulogne.[312] This piece of burlesque was one day to prove infinitely\r\nregrettable. After the disaster of Vittoria, Napoleon doubtless wished\r\nthat Joseph had for ever had free play in the tribune of the Senate\r\nrather than have dabbled in military affairs. But in the spring and\r\nsummer of 1804 the Emperor noted his every word; so that, when he\r\nventured to suggest that Josephine should not be crowned at the coming\r\ncoronation, Napoleon's wrath blazed forth. Why should Joseph speak of\r\n_his_ rights and _his_ interests? Who had won power? Who deserved to\r\nenjoy power? Power was his (Napoleon's) mistress, and he dared Joseph\r\nto touch her. The Senate or Council of State might oppose him for ten\r\nyears, without his becoming a tyrant: \"To make me a tyrant one thing\r\nalone is necessary--a movement of my family.\"[313]\r\n\r\nThe family, however, did not move. As happened with all the brothers\r\nexcept Lucien, Joseph gave way at the critical moment. After\r\nthreatening at the Council of State to resign his Grand Electorate and\r\nretire to Germany if his wife were compelled to bear Josephine's train\r\nat the coronation, he was informed by the Emperor that either he must\r\nconduct himself dutifully as the first subject of the realm, or retire\r\ninto private life, or oppose--and be crushed. The argument was\r\nunanswerable, and Joseph yielded. To save his own and his wife's\r\nfeelings, the wording of the official programme was altered: she was\r\n_to support Josephine's mantle_, not _to bear her train_.\r\n\r\nIn things great and small Napoleon carried his point. Although\r\nRoederer pleaded long and earnestly that Joseph and Louis should come\r\nnext to the Emperor in the succession, and inserted a clause in the\r\nreport which he was intrusted to draw up, yet by some skilful artifice\r\nthis clause was withdrawn from the constitutional act on which the\r\nnation was invited to express its opinion: and France assented to a\r\n_plébiscite_ for the establishment of the Empire in Napoleon's family,\r\nwhich passed over Joseph and Louis, as well as Lucien and Jerome, and\r\nvested the succession in the natural or adopted son of Napoleon, and\r\nin the heirs male of Joseph or Louis. Consequently these princes had\r\nno place in the succession, except by virtue of the _senatus\r\nconsultant_ of May 18th, which gave them a legal right, it is true,\r\nbut without the added sanction of the popular vote. More than three\r\nand a half million votes were cast for the new arrangement, a number\r\nwhich exceeded those given for the Consulate and the Consulate for\r\nLife. As usual, France accepted accomplished facts.\r\n\r\nMatters legal and ceremonial were now approaching completion for the\r\ncoronation. Negotiations had been proceeding between the Tuileries and\r\nthe Vatican, Napoleon begging and indeed requiring the presence of the\r\nPope on that occasion. Pius VII. was troubled at the thought of\r\ncrowning the murderer of the Duc d'Enghien; but he was scarcely his\r\nown master, and the dextrous hints of Napoleon that religion would\r\nbenefit if he were present at Notre Dame seem to have overcome his\r\nfirst scruples, besides quickening the hope of recovering the north of\r\nhis States. He was to be disappointed in more ways than one. Religion\r\nwas to benefit only from the enhanced prestige given to her rites in\r\nthe coming ceremony, not in the practical way that the Pope desired.\r\nAnd yet it was of the first importance for Napoleon to receive the\r\nholy oil and the papal blessing, for only so could he hope to wean the\r\naffections of royalists from their uncrowned and exiled king.\r\nDoubtless this was one of the chief reasons for the restoration of\r\nreligion by the Concordat, as was shrewdly seen at the time by\r\nLafayette, who laughingly exclaimed: \"Confess, general, that your\r\nchief wish is for the little phial.\"[314] The sally drew from the\r\nFirst Consul an obscene disclaimer worthy of a drunken ostler.\r\nNevertheless, the little phial was now on its way.\r\n\r\nIn order to divest the meeting of Pope and Emperor of any awkward\r\nceremony, Napoleon arranged that it should take place on the road\r\nbetween Fontainebleau and Nemours, as a chance incident in the middle\r\nof a day's hunting. The benevolent old pontiff was reclining in his\r\ncarriage, weary with the long journey through the cold of an early\r\nwinter, when he was startled to see the retinue of his host. The\r\ncontrast in every way was striking. The figure of the Emperor had now\r\nattained the fullness which betokens abounding health and strength: his\r\nface was slightly flushed with the hunt and the consciousness that he\r\nwas master of the situation, and his form on horseback gained a dignity\r\nfrom which the shortness of his legs somewhat detracted when on foot. As\r\nhe rode up attired in full hunting costume, he might have seemed the\r\nembodiment of triumphant strength. The Pope, on the other hand, clad in\r\nwhite garments and with white silk shoes, gave an impression of peaceful\r\nbenevolence, had not his intellectual features borne signs of the\r\nprotracted anxieties of his pontificate. The Emperor threw himself from\r\nhis horse and advanced to meet his guest, who on his side alighted,\r\nrather unwillingly, in the mud to give and receive the embrace of\r\nwelcome. Meanwhile Napoleon's carriage had been driven up: footmen were\r\nholding open both doors, and an officer of the Court politely handed\r\nPius VII. to the left door, while the Emperor, entering by the right,\r\ntook the seat of honour, and thus settled once for all the vexed\r\nquestion of social precedence.[315]\r\n\r\nDuring the Pope's sojourn at Fontainebleau, Josephine breathed to him\r\nher anxiety as to her marriage; it having been only a civil contract,\r\nshe feared its dissolution, and saw in the Pope's intervention a\r\nchance of a firmer union with her consort. The pontiff comforted her\r\nand required from Napoleon the due solemnization of his marriage; it\r\nwas therefore secretly performed by Napoleon's uncle, Cardinal Fesch,\r\ntwo days before the coronation.[316]\r\n\r\nIt was not enough, however, that the successor of St. Peter should\r\ngrace the coronation with his presence: the Emperor sought to touch\r\nthe imagination of men by figuring as the successor of Charlemagne. We\r\nhere approach one of the most interesting experiments of the modern\r\nworld, which, if successful, would profoundly have altered the face of\r\nEurope and the character of its States. Even in its failure it attests\r\nNapoleon's vivid imagination and boundless mental resources. He\r\naspired to be more than Emperor of the French: he wished to make his\r\nEmpire a cosmopolitan realm, whose confines might rival those of the\r\nHoly Roman Empire of one thousand years before, and embrace scores of\r\npeoples in a grand, well-ordered European polity.\r\n\r\nAlready his dominions included a million of Germans in the Rhineland,\r\nItalians of Piedmont, Genoa, and Nice, besides Savoyards, Genevese,\r\nand Belgians. How potent would be his influence on the weltering chaos\r\nof German and Italian States, if these much-divided peoples learnt to\r\nlook on him as the successor to the glories of Charlemagne! And this\r\nhonour he was now to claim. However delusive was the parallel between\r\nthe old semi-tribal polity and modern States where the peoples were\r\nawakening to a sense of their nationality, Napoleon was now in a\r\nposition to clear the way for his great experiment. He had two charms\r\nwherewith to work, material prosperity and his gift of touching the\r\npopular imagination. The former of these was already silently working\r\nin his favour: the latter was first essayed at the coronation.\r\n\r\nAlready, after a sojourn at Boulogne, he had visited Aix-la-Chapelle,\r\nthe city where Charlemagne's relics are entombed, and where Victor\r\nHugo in some of his sublimest verse has pictured Charles V. kneeling\r\nin prayer to catch the spirit of the mediæval hero. Thither went\r\nNapoleon, but in no suppliant mood; for when Josephine was offered the\r\narm-bones of the great dead, she also proudly replied that she would\r\nnot deprive the city of that precious relic, especially as she had the\r\nsupport of an arm as great as that of Charlemagne.[317] The insignia\r\nand the sword of that monarch were now brought to Paris, and shed on\r\nthe ceremony of coronation that historic gleam which was needed to\r\nredeem it from tawdry commonplace.\r\n\r\nAll that money and art could do to invest the affair with pomp and\r\ncircumstance had already been done. The advice of the new Master of\r\nthe Ceremonies, M. de Ségur, and the hints of the other nobles who had\r\nrallied to the new Empire, had been carefully collated by the untiring\r\nbrain that now watched over France. The sum of 1,123,000 francs had\r\nbeen expended on the coronation robes of Emperor and Empress, and far\r\nmore on crowns and tiaras. The result was seen in costumes of\r\nmatchless splendour; the Emperor wore a French coat of red velvet\r\nembroidered in gold, a short cloak adorned with bees and the collar of\r\nthe Legion of Honour in diamonds; and at the archbishop's palace he\r\nassumed the long purple robe of velvet profusely ornamented with\r\nermine, while his brow was encircled by a wreath of laurel, meed of\r\nmighty conquerors. In the pommel of his sword flashed the famous Pitt\r\ndiamond, which, after swelling the family fortune of the British\r\nstatesman, fell to the Regent of France, and now graced the coronation\r\nof her Dictator. The Empress, radiant with joy at her now indissoluble\r\nunion, bore her splendours with an easy grace that charmed all\r\nbeholders and gave her an almost girlish air. She wore a robe of white\r\nsatin, trimmed with silver and gold and besprinkled with golden bees:\r\nher waist and shoulders glittered with diamonds, while on her brows\r\nrested a diadem of the finest diamonds and pearls valued at more than\r\na million francs.[318] The curious might remember that for a necklace\r\nof less than twice that value the fair fame of Marie Antoinette had\r\nbeen clouded over and the House of Bourbon shaken to its base.\r\n\r\nThe stately procession began with an odd incident: Napoleon and\r\nJosephine, misled apparently by the all-pervading splendour of the new\r\nstate carriage, seated themselves on the wrong side, that is, in the\r\nseats destined for Joseph and Louis: the mistake was at once made good,\r\nwith some merriment; but the superstitious saw in it an omen of\r\nevil.[319] And now, amidst much enthusiasm and far greater curiosity,\r\nthe procession wound along through the Rue Nicaise and the Rue St.\r\nHonoré--streets where Bonaparte had won his spurs on the day of\r\nVendémiaire--over the Pont-Neuf, and so to the venerable cathedral,\r\nwhere the Pope, chilled by long waiting, was ready to grace the\r\nceremony. First he anointed Emperor and Empress with the holy oil; then,\r\nat the suitable place in the Mass he blessed their crowns, rings, and\r\nmantles, uttering the traditional prayers for the possession of the\r\nvirtues and powers which each might seem to typify. But when he was\r\nabout to crown the Emperor, he was gently waved aside, and Napoleon with\r\nhis own hands crowned himself. A thrill ran through the august assembly,\r\neither of pity for the feelings of the aged pontiff or of admiration at\r\nthe \"noble and legitimate pride\" of the great captain who claimed as\r\nwholly his own the crown which his own right arm had won. Then the\r\n_cortège_ slowly returned to the middle of the nave, where a lofty\r\nthrone had been reared.\r\n\r\nAnother omen now startled those who laid store by trifles. It was\r\nnoticed that the sovereigns in ascending the steps nearly fell\r\nbackwards under the weight of their robes and trains, though in the\r\ncase of Josephine the anxious moment may have been due to the\r\ncarelessness, whether accidental or studied, of her \"mantle-bearers.\"\r\nBut to those who looked beneath the surface of things was not this an\r\nall-absorbing portent, that all this religious pomp should be removed\r\nby scarcely eleven years from the time when this same nave echoed to\r\nthe shouts and gleamed with the torches of the worshippers of the\r\nnewly enthroned Goddess of Reason?\r\n\r\nRevolutionary feelings were not wholly dead, but they now vented\r\nthemselves merely in gibes. On the night before the coronation the walls\r\nof Paris were adorned with posters announcing: _The last Representation\r\nof the French Revolution--for the Benefit of a poor Corsican Family._\r\nAnd after the event there were inquiries why the new throne had no\r\n_glands d'or;_ the answer suggested because it was _sanglant_.[320]\r\nBeyond these quips and jests the Jacobins and royalists did not go. When\r\nthe phrase _your subjects_ was publicly assigned to the Corps Législatif\r\nby its courtier-like president, Fontanes, there was a flutter of wrath\r\namong those who had hoped that the new Empire was to be republican. But\r\nit quickly passed away; and no Frenchman, except perhaps Carnot, made so\r\nmanly a protest as the man of genius at Vienna, who had composed the\r\n\"Sinfonia Eroïca,\" and with grand republican simplicity inscribed it,\r\n\"Beethoven à Bonaparte.\" When the master heard that his former hero had\r\ntaken the imperial crown, he tore off the dedication with a volley of\r\ncurses on the renegade and tyrant; and in later years he dedicated the\r\nimmortal work to the _memory_ of a great man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE BOULOGNE FLOTILLA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the Empire, as has been seen, provoked few signs\r\nof opposition from the French armies, once renowned for their\r\nJacobinism; and by one or two instances of well-timed clemency, the\r\nEmperor gained over even staunch republicans. Notably was this the\r\ncase with a brave and stalwart colonel, who, enraged at the first\r\nvolley of cheers for the Empire, boldly ordered \"Silence in the\r\nranks.\" At once Napoleon made him general and appointed him one of his\r\naides-de-camp; and this brave officer, Mouton by name, was later to\r\ngain glory and the title of Comte de Lobau in the Wagram campaign.\r\nThese were the results of a timely act of generosity, such as touches\r\nthe hearts of any soldiery and leads them to shed their blood like\r\nwater. And so when Napoleon, after the coronation, distributed to the\r\ngarrison of Paris their standards, topped now by the imperial eagles,\r\nthe great Champ de Mars was a scene of wild enthusiasm. The thunderous\r\nshouts that acclaimed the prowess of the new Frankish leader were as\r\nwarlike as those which ever greeted the hoisting of a Carolingian King\r\non the shields of his lieges. Distant nations heard the threatening\r\ndin and hastened to muster their forces for the fray.\r\n\r\nAs yet only England was at war with the Emperor. Against her Napoleon\r\nnow prepared to embattle the might of his vast Empire. The\r\npreparations on the northern coast were now wellnigh complete, and\r\nthere was only one question to be solved--how to \"leap the ditch.\" It\r\nseems strange to us now that no attempt was made to utilize the great\r\nmotive force of the nineteenth century--steam power. And the French\r\nmemoir-writers, Marmont, Bourrienne, Pasquier, and Bausset, have\r\nexpressed their surprise that so able a chief as Napoleon should have\r\nneglected this potent ally.\r\n\r\nTheir criticisms seem to be prompted by later reflections rather\r\nthan based on an accurate statement of facts. In truth, the\r\nnineteenth-century Hercules was still in his cradle. Henry Bell had in\r\n1800 experimented with a steamer on the Clyde; but it aroused the same\r\ntrembling curiosity as Trevithick's first locomotive, or as Fulton's\r\nfirst paddle-boat built on the Seine in 1803. In fact, this boat of\r\nthe great American inventor was so weak that, when at anchor, it broke\r\nin half during a gale, thus ridding itself of the weight of its\r\ncumbrous engine. With his usual energy, Fulton built a larger and\r\nstronger craft, which not only carried the machinery, but, in August,\r\n1803, astonished the members of the French Institute by moving, though\r\nwith much circumspection.\r\n\r\nFulton, however, was disappointed, and if we may judge from the scanty\r\nrecords of his life, he never offered this invention to Napoleon.[321]\r\nHe felt the need of better machinery, and as this could only be\r\nprocured in England, he gave the order to a Birmingham firm, which\r\nengined his first successful boat, the \"Clermont,\" launched on the\r\nHudson in 1807. But for the war, perhaps, Fulton would have continued\r\nto live in Paris and made his third attempt there. He certainly never\r\noffered his imperfect steamship to the First Consul. Probably the fact\r\nthat his first boat foundered when at anchor in the Seine would have\r\nprocured him a rough reception, if he had offered to equip the whole\r\nof the Boulogne flotilla with an invention which had sunk its first\r\nreceptacle and propelled the second boat at a snail's pace.\r\n\r\nBesides, he had already met with one repulse from Napoleon. He had\r\noffered, first to the Directory and later to the First Consul, a boat\r\nwhich he claimed would \"deliver France and the world from British\r\noppression.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was a sailing vessel, which could sink under water and then\r\ndischarge under a hostile ship a \"carcass\" of gunpowder or\r\n_torpedo_--another invention of his fertile brain. The Directory at\r\nonce repulsed him. Bonaparte instructed Monge, Laplace, and Volney to\r\nreport on this submarine or \"plunging\" boat, which had a partial\r\nsuccess. It succeeded in blowing up a small vessel in the harbour at\r\nBrest in July, 1801; but the Commission seems to have reported\r\nunfavourably on its utility for offensive purposes. In truth, as\r\nFulton had not then applied motive power to this invention, the name\r\n\"plunging boat\" conveyed an exaggerated notion of its functions, which\r\nwere more suited to a life of ascetic contemplation than of\r\ndestructive activity.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the memoir-writers named above have confused the two\r\ndistinct inventions of Fulton just referred to. In the latter half of\r\n1803 he repaired to England, and later on to the United States, and\r\nafter the year 1803 he seems to have had neither the will nor the\r\nopportunity to serve Napoleon. In England he offered his torpedo\r\npatent to the English Admiralty, expressing his hatred of the French\r\nEmperor as a \"wild beast who ought to be hunted down.\" Little was done\r\nwith the torpedo in England, except to blow up a vessel off Walmer as\r\na proof of what it could do. It is curious also that when Bell offered\r\nhis paddle-boat to the Admiralty it was refused, though Nelson is said\r\nto have spoken in its favour. The official mind is everywhere hostile\r\nto new inventions; and Marmont suggestively remarks that Bonaparte's\r\ntraining as an artillerist, and his experience of the inconvenience\r\nand expense resulting from the adoption of changes in that arm, had no\r\nslight influence in setting him against all innovations.\r\n\r\nBut, to resume our description of the Boulogne flotilla, it may be of\r\ninterest to give some hitherto unpublished details about the\r\nflat-bottomed boats, and then to pass in brief review Napoleon's plans\r\nfor assuring a temporary command of the Channel.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that he at first relied almost solely on the flotilla.\r\nAfter one of his visits to Boulogne, he wrote on November 23rd, 1803,\r\nto Admiral Gantheaume that he would soon have on the northern coast\r\n1,300 flat-bottomed boats able to carry 100,000 men, while the Dutch\r\nflotilla would transport 60,000. \"Do you think it will take us to the\r\nEnglish coast? Eight hours of darkness which favour us would decide\r\nthe fate of the universe.\" There is no mention of any convoying fleet:\r\nthe First Consul evidently believed that the flotilla could beat off\r\nany attack at sea. This letter offers a signal proof of his inability,\r\nat least at that time, to understand the risks of naval warfare. But\r\nthough his precise and logical mind seems then to have been incapable\r\nof fully realizing the conditions of war on the fickle, troublous, and\r\ntide-swept Channel, his admirals urgently warned him against trusting\r\nto shallow, flat-bottomed boats to beat the enemy out at sea; for\r\nthough these _praams_ in their coasting trips repelled the attacks of\r\nBritish cruisers, which dared not come into shallow waters, it did not\r\nfollow that they would have the same success in mid-Channel, far away\r\nfrom coast defences and amidst choppy waves that must render the guns\r\nof keelless boats wellnigh useless.[320]\r\n\r\nThe present writer, after going through the reports of our admiral\r\nstationed in the Downs, is convinced that our seamen felt a supreme\r\ncontempt for the flat-bottomed boats when at sea. After the capture of\r\none of them, by an English gun-brig, Admiral Montagu reported,\r\nNovember 23rd, 1803:\r\n\r\n    \"It is impossible to suppose for an instant that anything\r\n    effective can be produced by such miserable tools, equally\r\n    ill-calculated for the grand essentials in a maritime formation,\r\n    battle and speed: that floored as this wretched vessel is, she\r\n    cannot hug the wind, but must drift bodily to leeward, which\r\n    indeed was the cause of her capture; for, having got a little to\r\n    leeward of Boulogne Bay, it was impossible to get back and she was\r\n    necessitated to steer large for Calais. On the score of battle,\r\n    she has one long 18-pounder, without breeching or tackle,\r\n    traversing on a slide, which can only be fired stem on. The\r\n    8-pounder is mounted aft, but is a fixture: so that literally, if\r\n    one of our small boats was to lay alongside there would be nothing\r\n    but musketry to resist, and those [_sic_] placed in the hands of\r\n    poor wretches weakened by the effect of seasickness, exemplified\r\n    when this gun-boat was captured--the soldiers having retreated to\r\n    the hold, incapable of any energy or manly exertion.... In short,\r\n    Sir, these vessels in my mind are completely contemptible and\r\n    ridiculous, and I therefore conclude that the numbers collected at\r\n    Boulogne are to keep our attention on the _qui vive_, and to gloss\r\n    over the real attack meditated from other points.\"\r\n\r\nThe vessel which provoked the contempt of our admiral was not one of\r\nthe smallest class: she was 58-1/3 ft. long, 14-1/2 ft. wide, drew 3\r\nft. forward and 4 ft. aft: her sides rose 3 ft. above the water, and\r\nher capacity was 35 tons. The secret intelligence of the Admiralty for\r\nthe years 1804 and 1805 also shows that Dutch sailors were equally\r\nconvinced of the unseaworthiness of these craft: Admiral Verhuell\r\nplainly told the French Emperor that, however flatterers might try to\r\npersuade him of the feasibility of the expedition, \"nothing but\r\ndisgrace could be expected.\" The same volume (No. 426) contains a\r\nreport of the capture of two of the larger class of French _chaloupes_\r\noff Cape La Hogue. Among the prisoners was a young French royalist\r\nnamed La Bourdonnais: when forced by the conscription to enter\r\nNapoleon's service, he chose to serve with the _chaloupes_ \"because\r\nof his conviction that all these flotillas were nothing but bugbears\r\nand would never attempt the invasion so much talked of and in which so\r\nfew persons really believe.\" The same was the opinion of the veteran\r\nGeneral Dumouriez, who, now an exile in England, drew up for our\r\nGovernment a long report on the proposed invasion and the means of\r\nthwarting it. The reports of our spies also prove that all experienced\r\nseamen on the Continent declared Napoleon's project to be either a\r\nruse or a foolhardy venture.\r\n\r\nThe compiler of the Ney \"Memoirs,\" who was certainly well acquainted\r\nwith the opinions of that Marshal, then commanding the troops at\r\nBoulogne, also believed that the flotilla was only able to serve as a\r\ngigantic ferry.[322] The French admirals were still better aware of\r\nthe terrible risks to their crowded craft in a fight out at sea. They\r\nalso pointed out that the difference in the size, draught, and speed\r\nof the boats must cause the dispersion of the flotilla, when its parts\r\nmight fall a prey to the more seaworthy vessels of the enemy. Indeed,\r\nthe only chance of crossing without much loss seemed to be offered by\r\na protracted calm, when the British cruisers would be helpless against\r\na combined attack of a cloud of row-boats. The risks would be greater\r\nduring a fog, when the crowd of boats must be liable to collision,\r\nstranding on shoals, and losing their way. Even the departure of this\r\nquaint armada presented grave difficulties: it was found that the\r\nwhole force could not clear the harbour in a single tide; and a part\r\nof the flotilla must therefore remain exposed to the British fire\r\nbefore the whole mass could get under way. For all these reasons\r\nBruix, the commander of the flotilla, and Decrès, Minister of Marine,\r\ndissuaded Napoleon from attempting the descent without the support of\r\na powerful covering fleet.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's correspondence shows that, by the close of the year 1803,\r\nhe had abandoned that first fatuous scheme which gained him from the\r\nwits of Paris the soubriquet of \"Don Quixote de la Manche.\"[323] On\r\nthe 7th of December he wrote to Gantheaume, maritime prefect at\r\nToulon, urging him to press on the completion of his nine ships of the\r\nline and five frigates, and sketching plans of a naval combination that\r\npromised to insure the temporary command of the Channel. Of these only\r\ntwo need be cited here:\r\n\r\n1. \"The Toulon squadron will set out on 20th _nivôse_ (January 10th,\r\n1804), will arrive before Cadiz (or Lisbon), will find there the\r\nRochefort squadron, will sail on without making land, between Brest\r\nand the Sorlingues, will touch at Cape La Hogue, and will pass in\r\nforty-eight hours before Boulogne: thence it will continue to the\r\nmouth of the Scheldt (there procuring masts, cordage, and all needful\r\nthings)--or perhaps to Cherbourg.\r\n\r\n2. \"The Rochefort squadron will set out on 20th _nivôse_, will reach\r\nToulon the 20th _pluviôse:_ the united squadrons will set sail in\r\n_ventôse_, and arrive in _germinal_ before Boulogne--that is rather\r\nlate. In any case the Egyptian Expedition will cover the departure of\r\nthe Toulon squadron: everything will be managed _so that Nelson will\r\nfirst sail for Alexandria_.\"\r\n\r\nThese schemes reveal the strong and also the weak qualities of\r\nNapoleon. He perceived the strength of the central position which\r\nFrance enjoyed on her four coasts; and he now contrived all his\r\ndispositions, both naval and political, so as to tempt Nelson away\r\neastwards from Toulon during the concentration of the French fleet in\r\nthe Channel; and for this purpose he informed the military officers at\r\nToulon that their destination was Taranto and the Morea. It was to\r\nthese points that he wished to decoy Nelson; for this end had he sent\r\nhis troops to Taranto, and kept up French intrigues in Corfu, the\r\nMorea, and Egypt; it was for this purpose that he charged that wily\r\nspy Méhée to inform Drake that the Toulon fleet was to take 40,000\r\nFrench troops to the Morea, and that the Brest fleet, with 200 highly\r\ntrained Irish officers, was intended solely for Ireland. But, while\r\ndisplaying consummate guile, he failed to allow for the uncertainties\r\nof operations conducted by sea. Ignoring the patent fact that the\r\nToulon fleet was blockaded by Nelson, and that of Rochefort by\r\nCollingwood, he fixed the dates of their departure and junction as\r\nthough he were ordering the movements of a _corps d'armée_ in\r\nProvence; and this craving for certainty was to mar his naval plans\r\nand dog his footsteps with the shadow of disaster.[324]\r\n\r\nThe plan of using the Toulon fleet to cover an invasion of England was\r\nnot entirely new. As far back as the days of De Tourville, a somewhat\r\nsimilar plan had been devised: the French Channel and Atlantic fleets\r\nunder that admiral were closely to engage Russell off the Isle of\r\nWight, while the Toulon squadron, sailing northwards, was to collect\r\nthe French transports on the coasts of Normandy for the invasion of\r\nEngland. Had Napoleon carefully studied French naval history, he would\r\nhave seen that the disaster of La Hogue was largely caused by the\r\nsevere weather which prevented the rendezvous, and brought about a\r\nhasty and ill-advised alteration in the original scheme. But of all\r\nsubjects on which he spoke as an authority, there was perhaps not one\r\nthat he had so inadequately studied as naval strategy: yet there was\r\nnone wherein the lessons of experience needed so carefully to be laid\r\nto heart.\r\n\r\nFortune seemed to frown on Napoleon's naval schemes: yet she was\r\nperhaps not unkind in thwarting them in their first stages. Events\r\noccurred which early suggested a deviation from the combinations\r\nnoticed above. In the last days of 1803, hearing that the English\r\nwere about to attack Martinique, he at once wrote to Gantheaume,\r\nurging him to despatch the Toulon squadron under Admiral\r\nLatouche-Tréville for the rescue of this important island. The\r\ncommander of the troops, Cervoni, was to be told that the expedition\r\naimed at the Morea, so that spies might report this news to Nelson,\r\nand it is clear from our admiral's despatches that the ruse half\r\nsucceeded. Distracted, however, by the thought that the French might,\r\nafter all, aim at Ireland, Nelson clung to the vicinity of Toulon, and\r\nhis untiring zeal kept in harbour the most daring admiral in the French\r\nnavy, who, despite his advanced age, excited an enthusiasm that none\r\nother could arouse.\r\n\r\nTo him, in spite of his present ill-fortune, Napoleon intrusted the\r\nexecution of a scheme bearing date July 2nd, 1804. Latouche was\r\nordered speedily to put to sea with his ten ships of the line and four\r\nfrigates, to rally a French warship then at Cadiz, release the five\r\nships of the line and four frigates blockaded at Rochefort by\r\nCollingwood, and then sweep the Channel and convoy the flotilla across\r\nthe straits. This has been pronounced by Jurien de la Gravière the\r\nbest of all Napoleon's plans: it exposed ships that had long been in\r\nharbour only to a short ocean voyage, and it was free from the\r\ncomplexity of the later and more grandiose schemes.\r\n\r\nBut fate interposed and carried off the intrepid commander by that\r\nworst of all deaths for a brave seaman, death by disease in harbour,\r\nwhere he was shut up by his country's foes (August 20th).\r\n\r\nVilleneuve was thereupon appointed to succeed him, while Missiessy\r\nheld command at Rochefort. The choice of Villeneuve has always been\r\nconsidered strange; and the riddle is not solved by the declaration of\r\nNapoleon that he considered that Villeneuve at the Nile showed his\r\n_good fortune_ in escaping with the only French ships which survived\r\nthat disaster. A strange reason this: to appoint an admiral commander\r\nof an expedition that was to change the face of the world because his\r\ngood fortune consisted in escaping from Nelson![325]\r\n\r\nNapoleon now began to widen his plans. According to the scheme of\r\nSeptember 29th, three expeditions were now to set out; the first was\r\nto assure the safety of the French West Indies; the second was to\r\nrecover the Dutch colonies in those seas and reinforce the French troops\r\nstill holding out in part of St. Domingo; while the third had as its\r\nobjective West Africa and St. Helena. The Emperor evidently hoped to\r\ndaze us by simultaneous attacks in Africa, America, and also in Asiatic\r\nwaters. After these fleets had set sail in October and November, 1804,\r\nIreland was to be attacked by the Brest fleet now commanded by\r\nGantheaume. Slipping away from the grip of Cornwallis, he was to pass\r\nout of sight of land and disembark his troops in Lough Swilly. These\r\ntroops, 18,000 strong, were under that redoubtable fighter, Augereau;\r\nand had they been landed, the history of the world might have been\r\ndifferent. Leaving them to revolutionize Ireland, Gantheaume was to make\r\nfor the English Channel, touch at Cherbourg for further orders, and\r\nproceed to Boulogne to convoy the flotilla across: or, if the weather\r\nprevented this, as was probable in January, he was to pass on to the\r\nTexel, rally the seven Dutch battleships and the transports with their\r\n25,000 troops, beat back down the English Channel and return to Ireland.\r\nNapoleon counted on the complete success of one or other of Gantheaume's\r\nmoves: \"Whether I have 30,000 or 40,000 men in Ireland, or whether I am\r\nboth in England and Ireland, the war is ours.\"[326]\r\n\r\nThe objections to the September combination are fairly obvious. It was\r\nexceedingly improbable that the three fleets could escape at the time\r\nand in the order which Napoleon desired, or that crews enervated by\r\nlong captivity in port would succeed in difficult operations when\r\nthrust out into the wintry gales of the Atlantic and the Channel.\r\nBesides, success could only be won after a serious dispersion of\r\nFrench naval resources; and the West Indian expeditions must be\r\nregarded as prompted quite as much by a colonial policy as by a\r\ndetermination to overrun England or Ireland.[327]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt any rate, if the Emperor's aim was merely to distract us by widely\r\ndiverging attacks, that could surely have been accomplished without\r\nsending twenty-six sail of the line into American and African waters,\r\nand leaving to Gantheaume so disproportionate an amount of work and\r\ndanger. This September combination may therefore be judged distinctly\r\ninferior to that of July, which, with no scattering of the French\r\nforces, promised to decoy Nelson away to the Morea and Egypt, while\r\nthe Toulon and Rochefort squadrons proceeded to Boulogne.\r\n\r\nThe September schemes hopelessly miscarried. Gantheaume did not elude\r\nCornwallis, and remained shut up in Brest. Missiessy escaped from\r\nRochefort, sailed to the West Indies, where he did some damage and\r\nthen sailed home again. \"He had taken a pawn and returned to his own\r\nsquare.\"[328] Villeneuve slipped out from Toulon (January 19th, 1805),\r\nwhile Nelson was sheltering from westerly gales under the lee of\r\nSardinia; but the storm which promised to renew his reputation for\r\ngood luck speedily revealed the weakness of his ships and crews.\r\n\r\n\"My fleet looked well at Toulon,\" he wrote to Decrès, Minister of\r\nMarine, \"but when the storm came on, things changed at once. The\r\nsailors were not used to storms: they were lost among the mass of\r\nsoldiers: these from sea-sickness lay in heaps about the decks: it was\r\nimpossible to work the ships: hence yard-arms were broken and sails\r\nwere carried away: our losses resulted as much from clumsiness and\r\ninexperience as from defects in the materials delivered by the\r\narsenals.\"[329]\r\n\r\nInexperience and sea-sickness were factors that found no place in\r\nNapoleon's calculations; but they compelled Villeneuve to return to\r\nToulon to refit; and there Nelson closed on him once more.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile events were transpiring which seemed to add to Napoleon's\r\nnaval strength and to the difficulties of his foes. On January 4th,\r\n1805, he concluded with Spain a treaty which added her naval resources\r\nto those of France, Holland, and Northern Italy. The causes that led\r\nto an open rupture between England and Spain were these. Spain had\r\nbeen called upon by Napoleon secretly to pay him the stipulated sum of\r\n72,000,000 francs a year (see p. 437), and she reluctantly consented.\r\nThis was, of course, a covert act of hostility against England; and\r\nthe Spanish Government was warned at the close of 1803 that, if this\r\nsubsidy continued to be paid to France, it would constitute \"at any\r\nfuture period, when circumstances may render it necessary, a just\r\ncause of war\" between England and Spain. Far from complying with this\r\nreasonable remonstrance, the Spanish Court yielded to Napoleon's\r\nimperious order to repair five French warships that had taken refuge\r\nin Ferrol from our cruisers, and in July, 1804, allowed French seamen\r\nto travel thither overland to complete the crews of these vessels.\r\nThus for some months our warships had to observe Ferrol, as if it were\r\na hostile port.\r\n\r\nClearly, this state of things could not continue; and when the\r\nprotests of our ambassador at Madrid were persistently evaded or\r\nignored, he was ordered, in the month of September, to leave that\r\ncapital unless he received satisfactory assurances. He did not leave\r\nuntil November 10th, and before that time a sinister event had taken\r\nplace. The British Ministry determined that Spanish treasure-ships from\r\nSouth America should not be allowed to land at Cadiz the sinews of war\r\nfor France, and sent orders to our squadrons to stop those ships. Four\r\nfrigates were told off for that purpose. On the 5th of October they\r\nsighted the four rather smaller Spanish frigates that bore the ingots of\r\nPeru, and summoned them to surrender, thereafter to be held in pledge.\r\nThe Spaniards, nobly resolving to yield only to overwhelming force,\r\nrefused; and in the ensuing fight one of their ships blew up, whereupon\r\nthe others hauled down their flags and were taken to England. Resenting\r\nthis action, Spain declared war on December 12th, 1804.\r\n\r\nStripped of all the rodomontade with which French historians have\r\nenveloped this incident, the essential facts are as follows. Napoleon\r\ncompelled Spain by the threat of invasion to pay him a large subsidy:\r\nEngland declared this payment, and accompanying acts, to be acts of\r\nwar; Spain shuffled uneasily between the two belligerents but\r\ncontinued to supply funds to Napoleon and to shelter and repair his\r\nwarships; thereupon England resolved to cut off her American\r\nsubsidies, but sent a force too small to preclude the possibility of a\r\nsea-fight; the fight took place, with a lamentable result, which\r\nchanged the covert hostility of Spain into active hostility.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion and popular narratives are, however, fashioned by\r\nsentiment rather than founded on evidence; accordingly, Britain's\r\nprestige suffered from this event. The facts, as currently reported,\r\nseemed to convict her of an act of piracy; and few persons on the\r\nContinent or among the Whig coteries of Westminster troubled to find\r\nout whether Spain had not been guilty of acts of hostility and whether\r\nthe French Emperor was not the author of the new war. Undoubtedly it\r\nwas his threatening pressure on Spain that had compelled her to her\r\nrecent action: but that pressure had been for the most part veiled by\r\ndiplomacy, while Britain's retort was patent and notorious.\r\nConsequently, every version of this incident that was based merely on\r\nnewspaper reports condemned her conduct as brutally piratical; and\r\nonly those who have delved into archives have discovered the real\r\nfacts of the case.[330] Napoleon's letter to the King of Spain quoted\r\non p. 437 shows that even before the war he was seeking to drag him\r\ninto hostilities with England, and he continued to exert a remorseless\r\npressure on the Court of Madrid; it left two alternatives open to\r\nEngland, either to see Napoleon close his grip on Spain and wield her\r\nnaval resources when she was fully prepared for war, or to precipitate\r\nthe rupture. It was the alternative, _mutatis mutandis_, presented to\r\nGeorge III. and the elder Pitt in 1761, when the King was for delay\r\nand his Minister was for war at once. That instance had proved the\r\nfather's foresight; and now at the close of 1804 the younger Pitt\r\nmight flatter himself that open war was better than a treacherous\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nIn lieu of a subsidy Spain now promised to provide from twenty-five to\r\ntwenty-nine sail of the line, and to have them ready by the close of\r\nMarch. On his side, Napoleon agreed to guarantee the integrity of the\r\nSpanish dominions, and to regain Trinidad for her. The sequel will\r\nshow how his word was kept.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of this alliance placed the hostile navies almost on an\r\nequality, at least on paper. But, as the equipment of the Spanish\r\nfleet was very slow, Napoleon for the present adhered to his plan of\r\nSeptember, 1804, with the result already detailed. Not until March\r\n2nd, 1805, do we find the influence of the Spanish alliance observable\r\nin his naval schemes. On that date he issued orders to Villeneuve and\r\nGantheaume, which assigned to the latter most of the initiative, as also\r\nthe chief command after their assumed junction. Gantheaume, with the\r\nBrest fleet, after eluding the blockaders, was to proceed first to\r\nFerrol, capture the British ships off that port and, reinforced by the\r\nFrench and Spanish ships there at anchor, proceed across the Atlantic to\r\nthe appointed rendezvous at Martinique. The Toulon squadron under\r\nVilleneuve was at the same time to make for Cadiz, and, after collecting\r\nthe Spanish ships, set sail for the West Indies. Then the armada was to\r\nreturn with all speed to Boulogne, where Napoleon expected it to arrive\r\nbetween June 10th and July 10th.[331]\r\n\r\nDiverse judgments have been passed on this, the last and grandest of\r\nNapoleon's naval combinations. On the one hand, it is urged that, as\r\nthe French fleets had seen no active service, a long voyage was\r\nnecessary to impart experience and efficiency before matters were\r\nbrought to the touch in the Straits of Dover; and as Britain and\r\nFrance both regarded their West Indian islands as their most valued\r\npossessions, a voyage thither would be certain to draw British sails\r\nin eager pursuit. Finally, those islands dotted over a thousand miles\r\nof sea presented a labyrinth wherein it would be easy for the French\r\nto elude Nelson's cruisers.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it may be urged that the success of the plan\r\ndepended on too many _ifs_. Assuming that the Toulon and Brest\r\nsquadrons escaped the blockaders, their subsequent movements would\r\nmost probably be reported by some swift frigate off Gibraltar or\r\nFerrol. The chance of our divining the French plans was surely as\r\ngreat as that Gantheaume and Villeneuve would unite in the West\r\nIndies, ravage the British possessions, and return in undiminished\r\nforce. The English fleets, after weary months of blockade, were adepts\r\nat scouting; their wings covered with ease a vast space, their\r\nfrigates rapidly signalled news to the flagship, and their\r\nconcentration was swift and decisive. Prompt to note every varying\r\npuff of wind, they bade fair to overhaul their enemies when the chase\r\nbegan in earnest, and when once the battle was joined, numbers counted\r\nfor little: the English crews, inured to fights on the ocean, might be\r\ntrusted to overwhelm the foe by their superior experience and\r\ndiscipline, hampered as the French now were by the lumbering and\r\ndefective warships of Spain.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, indeed, amply discounted the chances of failure of his\r\nultimate design, the command of the Channel. The ostensible aims of\r\nthe expedition were colonial. The French fleets were to take on board\r\n11,908 soldiers, of whom three-fourths were destined for the West\r\nIndies; and, in case Gantheaume did not join Villeneuve at Martinique,\r\nthe latter was ordered, after waiting forty days, to set sail for the\r\nCanaries, there to intercept the English convoys bound for Brazil and\r\nthe East Indies.\r\n\r\nIn the spring and summer of 1805 Napoleon's correspondence supplies\r\ncopious proof of the ideas and plans that passed through his brain.\r\nAfter firmly founding the new Empire, he journeyed into Piedmont,\r\nthence to Milan for his coronation as King of Italy, and finally to\r\nGenoa. In this absence of three months from Paris (April-July) many\r\nlengthy letters to Decrès attest the alternations of his hopes and\r\nfears. He now keeps the possibility of failure always before him: his\r\nletters no longer breathe the crude confidence of 1803: and while\r\nfacing the chances of failure in the West Indies, his thoughts swing\r\nback to the Orient:\r\n\r\n     \"According to all the news that I receive, five or six thousand men\r\n     in the [East] Indies would ruin the English Company. Supposing that\r\n     our [West] Indian expedition is not fully successful, and I cannot\r\n     reach the grand end which will demolish all the rest, I think we\r\n     must arrange the [East] Indian expedition for September. We have\r\n     now greater resources for it than some time ago.\"[332]\r\n\r\nHow tenacious is his will! He here recurs to the plan laid down before\r\nDecaen sailed to the East Indies in March, 1803. Even the prospects of\r\na continental coalition fail to dispel that gorgeous dream. But amid\r\nmuch that is visionary we may discern this element of practicality: in\r\ncase the blow against England misses the mark, Napoleon has provided\r\nhimself with a splendid alternative that will banish all thought of\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to recount here the well-known details of Villeneuve's\r\nvoyage and Nelson's pursuit. The Toulon and Cadiz fleets got clear\r\naway to the West Indies, and after a last glance towards the Orient,\r\nNelson set out in pursuit. On the 4th of June the hostile fleets were\r\nseparated by only a hundred miles of sea; and Villeneuve, when off\r\nAntigua, hearing that Nelson was so close, decided forthwith to return\r\nto Europe. After disembarking most of his troops and capturing a fleet\r\nof fourteen British merchantmen, he sailed for Ferrol, in pursuance of\r\norders just received from Napoleon, which bade him rally fifteen\r\nallied ships at that port, and push on to Brest, where he must release\r\nGantheaume.\r\n\r\nIn this gigantic war game, where the Atlantic was the chess-board, and\r\nthe prize a world-empire, the chances were at this time curiously\r\neven. Fortune had favoured Villeneuve but checked Gantheaume.\r\nVilleneuve successfully dodged Nelson in the West Indies, but\r\nultimately the pursuer divined the enemy's scheme of returning to\r\nEurope, and sent a swift brig to warn the Admiralty, which was thereby\r\ninformed of the exact position of affairs on July 8th, that is, twelve\r\ndays before Napoleon himself knew of the state of affairs. On July\r\n20th, the French Emperor heard, _through English newspapers_, that his\r\nfleet was on its return voyage: and his heart beat high with hope that\r\nVilleneuve would now gather up his squadrons in the Bay of Biscay and\r\nappear before Boulogne in overwhelming force; for he argued that, even\r\nif Villeneuve should keep right away from Brest, and leave blockaders\r\nand blockaded face to face, he would still be at least sixteen ships\r\nstronger than any force that could be brought against him.\r\n\r\nBut Napoleon was now committing the blunder which he so often censured\r\nin his inferiors. He was \"making pictures\" to himself, pictures in\r\nwhich the gleams of fortune were reserved for the tricolour flag, and\r\ngloom and disaster shrouded the Union Jack; he conceived that Nelson\r\nhad made for Jamaica, and that the British squadrons were engaged in\r\nchasing phantom French fleets around Ireland or to the East Indies.\r\n\"We have not to do,\" he said, \"with a far-seeing, but with a very\r\nproud, Government.\"\r\n\r\nIn reality, Nelson was nearing the coast of Portugal, Cornwallis had\r\nbeen so speedily reinforced as to marshal twenty-eight ships of the\r\nline off Brest, while Calder was waiting for Villeneuve off Cape\r\nFinisterre with a fleet of fifteen battleships. Thus, when Villeneuve\r\nneared the north-west of Spain, his twenty ships of the line were\r\nconfronted by a force which he could neither overwhelm nor shake off.\r\nThe combat of July 22nd, fought amidst a dense haze, was unfavourable\r\nto the allies, two Spanish ships of the line striking their colours to\r\nCalder before the gathering fog and gloom of night separated the\r\ncombatants: on the next two days Villeneuve strove to come to close\r\nquarters, but Calder sheered off; thereupon the French, unable then to\r\nmake Ferrol, put into Vigo, while Calder, ignorant of their position,\r\njoined Cornwallis off Brest. This retreat of the British admiral\r\nsubjected him to a court-martial, and consternation reigned in London\r\nwhen Villeneuve was known to be on the Spanish coast unguarded; but\r\nthe fear was needless; though the French admiral succeeded in rallying\r\nthe Ferrol squadron, yet, as he was ordered to avoid Ferrol, he put\r\ninto Corunna, and on August 15th he decided to sail for Cadiz.\r\n\r\nTo realize the immense importance of this decision we must picture to\r\nourselves the state of affairs just before this time.\r\n\r\nNelson, delayed by contrary winds and dogged by temporary ill-luck,\r\nhad made for Gibraltar, whence, finding that no French ships had\r\npassed the straits, he doubled back in hot haste northwards, and there\r\nis clear proof that his speedy return to the coast of Spain spread\r\ndismay in official circles at Paris. \"This unexpected union of forces\r\nundoubtedly renders every scheme of invasion impracticable for the\r\npresent,\" wrote Talleyrand to Napoleon on August 2nd, 1805.[333]\r\nMissing Villeneuve off Ferrol, Nelson joined Cornwallis off Ushant on\r\nthe very day when the French admiral decided to make for Cadiz.\r\nPassing on to Portsmouth, the hero now enjoyed a few days of\r\nwell-earned repose, until the nation called on him for his final\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Napoleon had arrived on August 3rd at Boulogne, where he\r\nreviewed a line of soldiery nine miles long. The sight might well\r\narouse his hopes of assured victory. He had ground for hoping that\r\nVilleneuve would soon be in the Channel. Not until August 8th did he\r\nreceive news of the fight with Calder, and he took pains to parade it\r\nas an English defeat. He therefore trusted that, in the spirit of his\r\norders to Villeneuve dated July the 26th, that admiral would sail to\r\nCadiz, gather up other French and Spanish ships, and return to Ferrol\r\nand Brest with a mighty force of some sixty sail of the line:\r\n\r\n     \"I count on your zeal for my service, on your love for the\r\n     fatherland, on your hatred of this Power which for forty\r\n     generations has oppressed us, and which a little daring and\r\n     perseverance on your part will for ever reduce to the rank of the\r\n     small Powers: 150,000 soldiers ... and the crews complete are\r\n     embarked on 2,000 craft of the flotilla, which, despite the English\r\n     cruisers, forms a long line of broadsides from Etaples to Cape\r\n     Grisnez. Your voyage, and it alone, makes us without any doubt\r\n     masters of England.\"\r\n\r\nAustria and Russia were already marshalling their forces for the war\r\nof the Third Coalition. Yet, though menaced by those Powers, to whom\r\nhe had recently offered the most flagrant provocations, this\r\nastonishing man was intent only on the ruin of England, and secretly\r\nderided their preparations. \"You need not\" (so he wrote to Eugène,\r\nViceroy of Italy) \"contradict the newspaper rumours of war, but make\r\nfun of them.... Austria's actions are probably the result of\r\nfear.\"--Thus, even when the eastern horizon lowered threateningly with\r\nclouds, he continued to pace the cliffs of Boulogne, or gallop\r\nrestlessly along the strand, straining his gaze westward to catch the\r\nfirst glimpse of his armada. That horizon was never to be flecked with\r\nVilleneuve's sails: they were at this time furled in the harbour of\r\nCadiz.\r\n\r\nUnmeasured abuse has been showered upon Villeneuve for his retreat to\r\nthat harbour. But it must be remembered that in both of Napoleon's\r\nlast orders to him, those of July 16th and 26th, he was required to\r\nsail to Cadiz under certain conditions. In the first order prescribing\r\nalternative ways of gaining the mastery of the Channel, that step was\r\nrecommended solely as a last alternative in case of misfortune: he was\r\ndirected not to enter the long and difficult inlet of Ferrol, but,\r\nafter collecting the squadron there, to cast anchor at Cadiz. In the\r\norder of July 26th he was charged positively to repair to Cadiz: \"My\r\nintention is that you rally at Cadiz the Spanish ships there,\r\ndisembark your sick, and, without stopping there more than four days\r\nat most, again set sail, return to Ferrol, etc.\" Villeneuve seems not\r\nto have received these last orders, but he alludes to those of July\r\n16th.[334]\r\n\r\nThese, then, were probably the last instructions he received from\r\nNapoleon before setting sail from the roads of Corunna on August 13th.\r\nThe censures passed on his retreat to Cadiz are therefore based on the\r\nsupposition that he received instructions which he did not\r\nreceive.[335] He expressly based his move to Cadiz on Napoleon's\r\norders of July 16th. The mishaps which the Emperor then contemplated\r\nas necessitating such a step had, in Villeneuve's eyes, actually\r\nhappened. The admiral considered the fight of July 22nd _la malheureuse\r\naffaire;_ his ships were encumbered with sick; they worked badly; on\r\nAugust 15th a north-east gale carried away the top-mast of a Spanish\r\nship; and having heard from a Danish merchantman the news--false news,\r\nas it afterwards appeared--that Cornwallis with twenty-five ships was to\r\nthe north, he turned and scudded before the wind. He could not divine\r\nthe disastrous influence of his conduct on the plan of invasion. He did\r\nnot know that his master was even then beginning to hesitate between a\r\ndash on London or a campaign on the Danube, and that the events of the\r\nnext few days were destined to tilt the fortunes of the world. Doubtless\r\nhe ought to have disregarded the Emperor's words about Cadiz and to have\r\nstruggled on to Brest, as his earlier and wider orders enjoined. But the\r\nEmperor's instructions pointed to Cadiz as the rendezvous in case of\r\nmisfortune or great difficulty. As a matter of fact, Napoleon on July\r\n26th ordered the Rochefort squadron to _meet Villeneuve at Cadiz;_ and\r\nit is clear that by that date Napoleon had decided on that rendezvous,\r\napparently because it could be more easily entered and cleared than\r\nFerrol, and was safer from attack. But, as it happened, the Rochefort\r\nsquadron had already set sail and failed to sight an enemy or friend for\r\nseveral weeks.\r\n\r\nSuch are the risks of naval warfare, in which even the greatest\r\ngeniuses at times groped but blindly. Nelson was not afraid to confess\r\nthe truth. The French Emperor, however, seems never to have made an\r\nadmission which would mar his claim to strategic infallibility. Even\r\nnow, when the Spanish ships were proved to clog the enterprise, he\r\npersisted in merely counting numbers, and in asserting that Villeneuve\r\nmight still neutralize the force of Calder and Cornwallis. These hopes\r\nhe cherished up to August 23rd, when, as the next chapter will show,\r\nhe faced right about to confront Austria. His Minister of Marine, who\r\nhad more truly gauged the difficulties of all parts of the naval\r\nenterprise, continued earnestly to warn him of the terrible risk of\r\nburdening Villeneuve's ships with the unseaworthy craft of Spain and\r\nof trusting to this ill-assorted armada to cover the invasion now that\r\ntheir foes had divined its secret. The Emperor bitterly upbraided his\r\nMinister for his timidity, and in the presence of Daru, Intendant\r\nGeneral of the army, indulged in a dramatic soliloquy against\r\nVilleneuve for his violation of orders: \"What a navy! What an admiral!\r\nWhat sacrifices for nothing! My hopes are frustrated--- Daru, sit down\r\nand write\"--whereupon it is said that he traced out the plans of the\r\ncampaign which was to culminate at Ulm and Austerlitz.[336]\r\n\r\nThe question has often been asked whether Napoleon seriously intended\r\nthe invasion of England. Certainly the experienced seamen of England,\r\nFrance, and Holland, with few exceptions, declared that the\r\nflat-bottomed boats were unseaworthy, and that a frightful disaster\r\nmust ensue if they were met out at sea by our ships. When it is\r\nfurther remembered that our coasts were defended by batteries and\r\nmartello towers, that several hundreds of pinnaces and row-boats were\r\nready to attack the flotilla before it could attempt the\r\ndisembarkation of horses, artillery, and stores, and that 180,000\r\nregulars and militia, aided by 400,000 volunteers, were ready to\r\ndefend our land, the difficulties even of capturing London will be\r\nobvious. And the capture of the capital would not have decided the\r\ncontest. Napoleon seems to have thought it would. In his voyage to St.\r\nHelena he said: \"I put all to the hazard; I entered into no\r\ncalculations as to the manner in which I was to return; I trusted all\r\nto the impression the occupation of the capital would have\r\noccasioned.\"[337]--But, as has been shown above (p. 441), plans had been\r\nsecretly drawn up for the removal of the Court and the national treasure\r\nto Worcester; the cannon of Woolwich were to be despatched into the\r\nMidlands by canal; and our military authorities reckoned that the\r\nsystematic removal of provisions and stores from all the districts\r\nthreatened by the enemy would exhaust him long before he overran the\r\nhome counties. Besides, the invasion was planned when Britain's naval\r\npower had been merely evaded, not conquered. Nelson and Cornwallis and\r\nCalder would not for ever be chasing phantom fleets; they would\r\ncertainly return, and cut Napoleon from his base, the sea.\r\n\r\nAgain, if Napoleon was bent solely on the invasion of England, why\r\nshould he in June, 1805, have offered to Russia and Austria so\r\ngratuitous an affront as the annexation of the Ligurian Republic? He\r\nmust have known that this act would hurry them into war. Thiers\r\nconsiders the annexation of Genoa a \"grave fault\" in the Emperor's\r\npolicy--but many have doubted whether Napoleon did not intend Genoa to\r\nbe the gate leading to a new avenue of glory, now that the success of\r\nhis naval dispositions was doubtful. Marbot gives the general opinion\r\nof military circles when he says that the Emperor wanted to provoke a\r\ncontinental war in order to escape the ridicule which the failure of\r\nhis Boulogne plans would otherwise have aroused. \"The new coalition\r\ncame just at the right moment to get him out of an annoying\r\nsituation.\" The compiler of the Fouché \"Memoirs,\" which, though not\r\ngenuine, may be accepted as generally correct, took the same view. He\r\nattributes to Napoleon the noteworthy words: \"I may fail by sea, but\r\nnot by land; besides, I shall be able to strike the blow before the\r\nold coalition machines are ready: the kings have neither activity nor\r\ndecision of character: I do not fear old Europe.\" The Emperor also\r\nremarked to the Council of State that the expense of all the\r\npreparations at Boulogne was fully justified by the fact that they\r\ngave him \"fully twenty days' start over all enemies.... A pretext had\r\nto be found for raising the troops and bringing them together without\r\nalarming the Continental Powers: and that pretext was afforded me by\r\nthe projected descent upon England.\"[338]\r\n\r\nIt is also quite possible that his aim was Ireland as much as England.\r\nIt certainly was in the plan of September, 1804: and doubtless it\r\nstill held a prominent place in his mind, except during the few days\r\nwhen he pictured Calder vanquished and Nelson scouring the West\r\nIndies. Then he doubtless fixed his gaze solely upon London. But there\r\nis much indirect evidence which points to Ireland as forming at least\r\na very important part of his scheme. Both Nelson and Collingwood\r\nbelieved him to be aiming at Ireland.[339]\r\n\r\nBut indeed Napoleon is often unfathomable. Herein lies much of the\r\ncharm of Napoleonic studies. He is at once the Achilles, the Mercury,\r\nand the Proteus of the modern world. The ease with which his mind\r\ngrasped all problems and suddenly concentrated its force on some new\r\nplan may well perplex posterity as it dazed his contemporaries. If we\r\nwere dealing with any other man than Napoleon, we might safely say\r\nthat an invasion of England, before the command of the sea had been\r\nsecured, was infinitely less likely than a descent on Ireland. The\r\nlanding of a _corps d'armée_ there would have provoked a revolution;\r\nand British ascendancy would have vanished in a week. Even had Nelson\r\nreturned and swept the seas, Ireland would have been lost to the\r\nUnited Kingdom; and Britain, exhausted also by the expenses which the\r\nBoulogne preparations had compelled her to make for the defence of\r\nLondon, must have succumbed.\r\n\r\nIf ever Napoleon intended risking all his fortunes on the conquest of\r\nEngland, it can be proved that his mind was gradually cleared of\r\nillusions. He trusted that a popular rising would overthrow the British\r\nGovernment: people and rulers showed an accord that had never been known\r\nsince the reign of Queen Anne. He believed, for a short space, that the\r\nflotilla could fight sea-going ships out at sea: the converse was proved\r\nup to the hilt. Finally, he trusted that Villeneuve, when burdened with\r\nSpanish ships, would outwit and outmanoeuvre Nelson!\r\n\r\nWhat then remained after these and many other disappointments? Surely\r\nthat scheme alone was practicable, in which the command of the sea\r\nformed only an unimportant factor. For the conquest of England it was\r\nan essential factor. In Ireland alone could Napoleon find the\r\nconditions on which he counted for success--a discontented populace\r\nthat would throng to the French eagles, and a field of warfare where\r\nthe mere landing of 20,000 veterans would decide the campaign.[340]\r\n\r\nAnd yet it is, on the whole, certain that his expedition for Ireland\r\nwas meant merely to distract and paralyze the defenders of Great\r\nBritain, while he dealt the chief blow at London. Instinct and\r\nconviction alike prompted him to make imposing feints that should lead\r\nhis enemy to lay bare his heart, and that heart was our great capital.\r\nHis indomitable will scorned the word _impossible_--\"a word found only\r\nin the dictionary of fools\"; he felt England to be the sole barrier to\r\nhis ambitions; and to crush her power he was ready to brave, not only\r\nher stoutest seamen, but also her guardian angels, the winds and\r\nstorms. Both the man and the occasion were unique in the world's\r\nhistory and must not be judged according to tame probabilities. For\r\nhis honour was at stake. He was so deeply pledged to make use of the\r\nvast preparations at his northern ports that, had all his complex\r\ndispositions worked smoothly, he would certainly have attempted a dash\r\nat London; and only after some adequate excuse could he consent to give\r\nup that adventure.\r\n\r\nThe excuse was now furnished by Villeneuve's retreat to Cadiz; and\r\npublic opinion, ignorant of Napoleon's latest instructions on that\r\nsubject, and knowing only the salient facts of the case, laid on that\r\nluckless admiral the whole burden of blame for the failure of the\r\nscheme of invasion. With front unabashed and a mind presaging certain\r\ntriumphs, Napoleon accordingly wheeled his legions eastward to\r\nprosecute that alluring alternative, the conquest of England through\r\nthe Continent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n[_The two following State Papers have never before been published_]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. I. is a despatch from Mr. Thornton, our _chargé d'affaires_ at\r\nWashington, relative to the expected transfer of the vast region of\r\nLouisiana from Spain to France (see ch. xv. of this vol.).\r\n\r\n  [In \"F O.,\" America, No. 35.]\r\n  \"WASHINGTON,\r\n  \"26 _Jany._, 1802.\r\n\r\n     \"MY LORD,\r\n\r\n     \"... About four years ago, when the rumour of the transfer of\r\n     Louisiana to France was first circulated, I put into Mr.\r\n     Pickering's hands for his perusal a despatch written by Mr. Fauchet\r\n     about the year 1794, which with many others was intercepted by one\r\n     of H.M. ships. In that paper the French Minister urged to his\r\n     Government the absolute necessity of acquiring Louisiana or some\r\n     territory in the vicinity of the United States in order to obtain a\r\n     permanent influence in the country, and he alluded to a memorial\r\n     written some years before by the Count du Moutier to the same\r\n     effect, when he was employed as His Most Christian Majesty's\r\n     Minister to the United States. The project seems therefore to have\r\n     been long in the contemplation of the French Government, and\r\n     perhaps no period is more favourable than the present for carrying\r\n     it into execution.\r\n\r\n     \"When I paid my respects to the Vice-President, Mr. Burr, on his\r\n     arrival at this place, he, of his own accord, directed conversation\r\n     to this topic. He owned that he had made some exertion indirectly\r\n     to discover the truth of the report, and thought he had reason to\r\n     believe it. He appeared to think that the great armament destined\r\n     by France to St. Domingo, had this ulterior object in view, and\r\n     expressed much apprehension that the transfer and colonization of\r\n     Louisiana were meditated by her with the concurrence or\r\n     acquiescence of His Maj'^{s} Gov^{t}. It was impossible for me to\r\n     give any opinion on this part of the measure, which, whatever may\r\n     be its ultimate tendency, presents at first view nothing but danger\r\n     to His Maj'^{s} Trans-Atlantic possessions.\r\n\r\n     \"Regarding alone the aim of France to acquire a preponderating\r\n     influence in the councils of the United States, it may be very well\r\n     doubted whether the possession of Louisiana, and the means which\r\n     she would chose to employ are calculated to secure that end.\r\n     Experience seems now to have sanctioned the opinion that if the\r\n     provinces of Canada had been restored to France at the Peace of\r\n     Paris, and if from that quarter she had been left to press upon the\r\n     American frontier, to harass the exterior settlements and to mingle\r\n     in the feuds of the Indian Tribes, the colonies might still have\r\n     preserved their allegiance to the parent country and have retained\r\n     their just jealousy of that system of encroachment adopted by\r\n     France from the beginning of the last century. The present project\r\n     is but a continuance of the same system; and neither her power nor\r\n     her present temper leave room for expectation that she will pursue\r\n     it with less eagerness or greater moderation than before. Whether,\r\n     therefore, she attempt to restrain the navigation of the\r\n     Mississippi or limit the freedom of the port of New Orleans;\r\n     whether she press upon the Western States with any view to\r\n     conquest, or seduce them by her principles of fraternity (for which\r\n     indeed they are well prepared) she must infallibly alienate the\r\n     Atlantic States and force them into a straiter connection with\r\n     Great Britain.\r\n\r\n     \"I have scarcely met with a person under whatever party he may rank\r\n     himself, who does not dread this event, and who would not prefer\r\n     almost any neighbours to the French: and it seems perfect\r\n     infatuation in the Administration of this country that they chuse\r\n     the present moment for leaving that frontier almost defenceless by\r\n     the reduction of its military establishment.\r\n\r\n     \"I have, etc.,\r\n\r\n     \"[Signed] EDW'D THORNTON.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo. II. is a report in \"F.O.,\" France, No. 71, by one of our spies in\r\nParis on the doings of the Irish exiles there, especially O'Connor,\r\nwhom Napoleon had appointed General of Division in Marshal Augereau's\r\narmy, then assembling at Brest for the expedition to Ireland. After\r\nstating O'Connor's appointment, the report continues:\r\n\r\n    \"About eighty Irishmen were sent to Morlaix to be formed into a\r\n    company of officers and taught how they were to discipline and\r\n    instruct their countrymen when they landed in Ireland. McShee,\r\n    Général de Brigade, commands them. He and Blackwell are, I\r\n    believe, the only persons among them of any consequence, who have\r\n    seen actual service. Emmett's brother and McDonald, who were\r\n    jealous of the attention paid to O'Connor, would not go to\r\n    Morlaix. They were prevailed on to go to Brest towards the end of\r\n    May, and there to join General Humbert. Commandant Dalton, a young\r\n    man of Irish extraction, and lately appointed to a situation in\r\n    the Army at Boulogne, translated everything between O'Connor and\r\n    the War Department at Paris. There is no Irish Committee at Paris\r\n    as is reported. O'Connor and General Hartry, an old Irishman who\r\n    has been long in the French service, are the only persons applied\r\n    to by the French Government, O'Connor for the expedition, and\r\n    Hartry for the Police, etc., of the Irish in France.\r\n\r\n    \"O'Connor, though he had long tried to have an audience of\r\n    Bonaparte, never saw him till the 20th of May [1805], when he was\r\n    presented to him at the levee by Marshal Augereau. The Emperor and\r\n    the Empress complimented him on his dress and military appearance,\r\n    and Bonaparte said to him _Venez me voir en particulier demain\r\n    matin._ O'Connor went and was alone with him near two hours. On\r\n    that day Bonaparte did not say a word to him respecting his\r\n    intention on England; all their conversation regarded Ireland.\r\n    O'Connor was with him again on the Thursday and Friday following.\r\n    Those three audiences are all that O'Connor ever had in private\r\n    with Bonaparte.\r\n\r\n    \"He told me on the Saturday evening that he should go to Court the\r\n    next morning to take public leave of the Emperor and leave Paris\r\n    as soon as he had received 10,000 livres which Maret was to give\r\n    him for his travelling expenses, etc., and which he was to have in\r\n    a day or two. His horses and all his servants but one had set off\r\n    for Brest some time before.\r\n\r\n    \"Bonaparte told O'Connor, when speaking of the prospect of a\r\n    continental War, 'la Russie peut-être pourroit envoyer cette année\r\n    100,000 hommes contre la France, mais j'ai pour cela assez de\r\n    monde à ma disposition: je ferois même marcher, s'il le faut, une\r\n    armée contre la Russie, et si l'Empereur d'Allemagne refusoit un\r\n    passage à cette armée dans son pays, je la ferois passer malgré\r\n    lui.' He afterwards said--'il y a plusieurs moyens de détruire\r\n    l'Angleterre, mais celui de lui ôter Irlande est bon. Je vous\r\n    donnerai 25,000 bonnes troupes et s'il en arrive seulement 15,000,\r\n    ce sera assez. Vous aurez aussi 150,000 fusils pour armer vos\r\n    compatriotes, et un parc d'artillerie légère, des pièces de 4 et\r\n    de 6 livres, et toutes les provisions de guerre nécessaires.'\r\n\r\n    \"O'Connor endeavoured to persuade Bonaparte that the best way to\r\n    conquer England was first to go to Ireland, and thence to England\r\n    with 200,000 Irishmen. Bonaparte said he did not think that would\r\n    do; _d'ailleurs,_ he added, _ce seroit trop long_. They agreed\r\n    that all the English in Ireland should be exterminated as the\r\n    whites had been in St. Domingo. Bonaparte assured him that, as\r\n    soon as he had formed an Irish army, he should be Commander in\r\n    Chief of the French and Irish forces. Bonaparte directed O'Connor\r\n    to try to gain over to his interest Laharpe, the Emperor of\r\n    Russia's tutor. Laharpe had applied for a passport to go to St.\r\n    Pétersbourg. He says he will do everything in his power to engage\r\n    the Emperor to go to war with Bonaparte. Laharpe breathes nothing\r\n    but vengeance against Bonaparte, who, besides other injuries,\r\n    turned his back on him in public and would not speak to him.\r\n    Laharpe was warned of O'Connor's intended visit, and went to the\r\n    country to avoid seeing him: The Senator Garat is to go to Brest\r\n    with O'Connor to write a constitution for Ireland. O'Connor is\r\n    getting out of favor with the Irish in France; they begin to\r\n    suspect his ambitious and selfish views. There was a coolness\r\n    between Admiral Truguet and him for some time previous to\r\n    Truguet's return to Brest. Augereau had given a dinner to all the\r\n    principal officers of his army then at Paris. Truguet invited all\r\n    of them to dine with him, two or three days after, except\r\n    O'Connor. O'Connor told me he would never forgive him for it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVOLUME II\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nULM AND TRAFALGAR\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Napoleon is the only man in Europe that knows the value of\r\ntime.\"--Czartoryski.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore describing the Continental campaign which shattered the old\r\nEuropean system to its base, it will be well to take a brief glance at\r\nthe events which precipitated the war of the Third Coalition. Even at\r\nthe time of Napoleon's rupture with England, his highhanded conduct\r\ntowards the Italian Republic, Holland, Switzerland, and in regard to\r\nthe Secularizations in Germany, had exposed him to the hostility of\r\nRussia, Sweden, and Austria; but as yet it took the form of secret\r\nresentment. The last-named Power, under the Ministry of Count Cobenzl,\r\nhad relapsed into a tame and undignified policy, which the Swedish\r\nAmbassador at Vienna described as \"one of fear and hope--fear of the\r\npower of France, and hope to obtain favours from her.\"[1] At Berlin,\r\nFrederick William clung nervously to neutrality, even though the\r\nFrench occupation of Hanover was a threat to Prussia's influence in\r\nNorth Germany. The Czar Alexander was, at present, wrapt up in home\r\naffairs; and the only monarch who as yet ventured to show his dislike\r\nof the First Consul was the King of Sweden. In the autumn of 1803\r\nGustavus IV. defiantly refused Napoleon's proposals for a\r\nFranco-Swedish alliance, baited though they were with the offer of\r\nNorway as an eventual prize for Sweden, and a subsidy for every\r\nSwedish warship serving against England. And it was not the dislike of\r\na proud nature to receive money which prompted his refusal; for\r\nGustavus, while in Germany, hinted to Drake that he desired to have\r\npecuniary help from England for the defence of his province of\r\nPomerania.[2]\r\n\r\nBut a doughtier champion of European independence was soon to enter\r\nthe field. The earlier feelings of respect and admiration which the\r\nyoung Czar had cherished towards Napoleon were already overclouded,\r\nwhen the news of the execution of the Duc d'Enghien at once roused a\r\nstorm of passion in his breast. The chivalrous protection which he\r\nloved to extend to smaller States, the guarantee of the Germanic\r\nsystem which the Treaty of Teschen had vested in him, above all, his\r\nhorror at the crime, led him to offer an emphatic protest. The Russian\r\nCourt at once went into mourning, and Alexander expressed both to the\r\nGerman Diet and to the French Government his indignation at the\r\noutrage. It was ever Napoleon's habit to return blow with blow; and he\r\nnow instructed Talleyrand to reply that in the D'Enghien affair he had\r\nacted solely on the defensive, and that Russia's complaint \"led him to\r\nask if, at the time when England was compassing the assassination of\r\nPaul I., the authors of the plot had been known to be one league\r\nbeyond the [Russian] frontiers, every effort would not have been made\r\nto have them seized?\" Never has a poisoned dart been more deftly sped\r\nat the weak spot of an enemy's armour. The Czar, ever haunted by the\r\nthought of his complicity in a parricidal plot, was deeply wounded by\r\nthis malicious taunt, and all the more so because, as the death of\r\nPaul had been officially ascribed to a fit, the insult could not be\r\nflung back.[3] The only reply was to break off all diplomatic\r\nrelations with Napoleon; and this took place in the summer of 1804.[4]\r\n\r\nYet war was not to break out for more than a year. This delay was due\r\nto several causes. Austria could not be moved from her posture of\r\ntimid neutrality. In fact, Francis II. and Cobenzl saw in Napoleon's\r\nneed of a recognition of his new imperial title a means of assuring a\r\ncorresponding change of title for the Hapsburg Dominions. Francis had\r\nlong been weary of the hollow dignity of Elective Emperor of the Holy\r\nRoman Empire. The faded pageantry of Ratisbone and Frankfurt was all\r\nthat remained of the glories of the realm of Charlemagne: the medley\r\nof States which owned him as elected lord cared not for the decrees of\r\nthis ghostly realm; and Goethe might well place in the mouth of his\r\njovial toper, in the cellar scene of \"Faust,\" the words:\r\n\r\n                    \"Dankt Gott mit jedem Morgen\r\n  Dass Ihr nicht braucht für's Röm'sche Reich zu sorgen!\"\r\n\r\nIn that bargaining and burglarious age, was it not better to build a\r\nmore lasting habitation than this venerable ruin? Would not the\r\nhereditary dominions form a more lasting shelter from the storm? Such\r\nwere doubtless the thoughts that prompted the assumption of the title\r\nof Hereditary Emperor of Austria (August 11th, 1804). The\r\nletter-patent, in which this change was announced, cited as parallels\r\n\"the example of the Imperial Court of Russia in the last century and\r\nof the new sovereign of France.\" Both references gave umbrage to\r\nAlexander, who saw no parallel between the assumption of the title of\r\nEmperor by Peter the Great and the game of follow-the-leader played by\r\nFrancis to Napoleon.[5]\r\n\r\nPrussian complaisance to the French Emperor was at this time to be\r\nexpected. Frederick William III. reigned over 10,000,000 subjects; he\r\ncould marshal 248,000 of the best trained troops in Europe, and his\r\nrevenue was more fruitful than that of the great Frederick. Yet the\r\neffective power of Prussia had sadly waned; for her policy was now\r\nmarked by an enervating indecision. In the autumn of 1804, however,\r\nthe Prussian King was for a time spurred into action by the news that\r\nSir George Rumbold, British envoy at Hamburg, had been seized on the\r\nnight of October 24th, by French troops, and carried off to Paris.\r\nThis aggression upon the Circle of Lower Saxony, of which Frederick\r\nWilliam was Director, aroused lively indignation at Berlin; and the\r\nKing at once wrote to Napoleon a request for the envoy's liberation as\r\na proof of his \"friendship and high consideration ...a seal on the past\r\nand a pledge for the future.\"\r\n\r\nTo this appeal Napoleon returned a soothing answer that Sir George\r\nwould at once be released, though England was ever violating the\r\nrights of neutrals, and her agents were conspiring against his life.\r\nThe Emperor, in fact, saw that he had taken a false step, which might\r\nthrow Prussia into the arms of England and Russia. For this latter\r\nPower had already (May, 1804) offered her armed help to the Court of\r\nBerlin in case the French should violate any other German\r\nterritory.[6] But the King was easily soothed; and when, in the\r\nfollowing spring, Napoleon sent seven Golden Eagles of the Legion of\r\nHonour to the Court of Berlin, seven Black Eagles of the renowned\r\nPrussian Order were sent in return--an occurrence which led Gustavus\r\nIV. to return his Order of the Black Eagle with the remark that he\r\ncould not recognize \"Napoleon and his like\" as comrades in an Order of\r\nChivalry and Religion.[7] Napoleon's aim was achieved: Prussia was\r\nsundered from any league in which Gustavus IV. was a prominent member.\r\n\r\nThus, the chief steps in the formation of the Third Coalition were\r\ntaken by Sweden, England, and Russia. Early in 1804 Gustavus proposed\r\na League of the Powers; and, on the advent of the Pitt Ministry to\r\noffice, overtures began to pass between St. Petersburg and London for\r\nan alliance. Important proposals were made by Pitt and our Foreign\r\nMinister, the Earl of Harrowby, in a note of June 26th, 1804, in which\r\nhopes were expressed that Russia, England, Austria, Sweden, and if\r\npossible Prussia, might be drawn together.[8] Alexander and\r\nCzartoryski were already debating the advantages of an alliance with\r\nEngland. Their aims were certainly noble. International law and the\r\nrights of the weak States bordering on France were to be championed,\r\nand it was suggested by Czartoryski that disputes should be settled,\r\nnot by force, but by arbitration.[9]\r\n\r\nThe statement of these exalted ideas was intrusted to a special envoy\r\nto London, M. Novossiltzoff, who propounded to Pitt the scheme of a\r\nEuropean polity where the States should be independent and enjoy\r\ninstitutions \"founded on the sacred rights of humanity.\" With this aim\r\nin view, the Czar desired to curb the power of Napoleon, bring back\r\nFrance to her old limits, and assure the peace of Europe on a firm\r\nbasis, namely on the principle of the _balance of power_. Pitt and\r\nLord Harrowby having agreed to these proposals, details were discussed\r\nat the close of 1804. None of the allies were, in any case, to make a\r\nseparate peace; and England (said M. Novossiltzoff) must not only use\r\nher own troops, but grant subsidies to enable the Powers to set on\r\nfoot effective forces.\r\n\r\nThis last sentence claims special notice, as it disposes of the\r\nwell-worn phrase, that the Third Coalition was _built up_ by Pitt's\r\ngold. On the contrary, Russia was the first to set forth the need of\r\nEnglish subsidies, which Pitt was by no means eager to supply. The\r\nphrase used by French historians is doubtless correct in so far as\r\nEnglish gold enabled our allies to arm efficiently; but it is wholly\r\nfalse if it implies that the Third Coalition was merely trumped up by\r\nour money, and that the Russian, Austrian, and Swedish Governments\r\nwere so many automatic machines which, if jogged with coins, would\r\ninstantly supply armies to the ready money purchaser. This is\r\npractically the notion still prevalent on the Continent; and it is\r\nclearly traceable to the endless diatribes against Pitt's gold with\r\nwhich Napoleon seasoned his bulletins, and to the caricatures which he\r\n_ordered to be drawn_. The following was his direction to his Minister\r\nof Police, Fouché: \"Have caricatures made--an Englishman purse in\r\nhand, _entreating the various Powers to take his money. This is the\r\nreal direction to give the whole business._\" How well he knew mankind:\r\nhe rightly counted on its gullibility where pictures were concerned;\r\nand the direction which he thus gave to public opinion bids fair to\r\npersist, in spite of every exposure of the trickery.[10]\r\n\r\nBut, to return to the plans of the allies, Holland, Switzerland, and\r\nItaly were to be liberated from their \"enslavement to France,\" and\r\nstrengthened so as to provide barriers to future aggressions: the King\r\nof Sardinia was to be restored to his mainland possessions, and\r\nreceive in addition the Ligurian, or Genoese, Republic.[11]\r\n\r\nOn all essential topics the British Government was in full accord with\r\nthe views of the Czar, and Pitt insisted on the need of a system of\r\ninternational law which should guarantee the Continent against further\r\nrapacious acts. But Europe was not destined to find peace on these\r\nprinciples until after ten years of desolating war.\r\n\r\nVarious causes hindered the formation of this league. On January 2nd,\r\n1805, Napoleon sent to George III. an offer of peace; and those\r\npersons who did not see that this was a device for discovering the\r\ncourse of negotiations believed that he ardently desired it. We now\r\nknow that the offer was despatched a week after he had ordered\r\nMissiessy to ravage the British West Indies.[12] And, doubtless, his\r\nobject was attained when George III. replied in the speech from the\r\nthrone (January 15th) that he could not entertain the proposal without\r\nreference to the Powers with whom he was then engaged in confidential\r\nintercourse, and especially the Emperor of Russia. Yet the British\r\nGovernment discussed with the Czar the basis for a future pacification\r\nof Europe; and the mission of Novossiltzoff at midsummer to Berlin, on\r\nhis way to Paris, was the answer, albeit a belated one, to Napoleon's\r\nNew Year's pacific appeal. We shall now see why this delay occurred,\r\nand what acts of the French Emperor finally dispelled all hopes of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThe delay was due to differences between Russia and England respecting\r\nMalta and our maritime code. The Czar insisted on our relinquishing\r\nMalta and relaxing the rigours of the right of search for deserters\r\nfrom our navy. To this the Pitt Ministry demurred, seeing that Malta\r\nwas our only means of protecting the Mediterranean States, and our\r\nonly security against French aggressions in the Levant, while the\r\nright of searching neutral vessels was necessary to prevent the\r\nenfeebling of our navy.[13] Negotiations were nearly broken off even\r\nafter a treaty between the two Powers had been brought to the final\r\nstage on April 11th, 1805; but in July (after the Czar had recorded\r\nhis solemn protest against our keeping Malta) it was ratified, and\r\nformed the basis for the Third Coalition. The aims of the allies were\r\nto bring about the expulsion of French troops from North Germany; to\r\nassure the independence of the Republics of Holland and Switzerland;\r\nand to reinstate the King of Sardinia in Piedmont. Half a million of\r\nmen were to be set in motion, besides the forces of Great Britain; and\r\nthe latter Power, as a set-off to her lack of troops, agreed to\r\nsubsidize her allies to the extent of; £1,250,000 a year for every\r\n100,000 men actually employed in the war. It was further stipulated\r\nthat a European Congress at the close of the war should endeavour to\r\nfix more surely the principles of the Law of Nations and establish a\r\nfederative system. Above all, the allies bound themselves not to\r\nhinder the popular wish in France respecting the form of government--a\r\nclause which deprived the war of the Third Coalition of that\r\nmonarchical character which had pervaded the league of 1793 and, to a\r\nless extent, that of 1799.[14]\r\n\r\nWhat was the attitude of Napoleon towards this league? He certainly\r\ntook little pains to conciliate the Czar. In fact, his actions towards\r\nRussia were almost openly provocative. Thus, while fully aware of the\r\ninterest which Alexander felt in the restoration of the King of\r\nSardinia, he sent the proposal that that unlucky King should receive\r\nthe Ionian Isles and Malta as indemnities for his losses, and that too\r\nwhen Russia looked upon Corfu as her own. To this offer the Czar\r\ndeigned not a word in reply. Napoleon also sent an envoy to the Shah\r\nof Persia with an offer of alliance, so as to check the advances of\r\nRussia on the shores of the Caspian.[15]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he used every effort to allure Prussia, by secretly\r\noffering her Hanover, and that too as early as the close of July.[16]\r\nFor a brief space, also, he took some pains to conciliate Austria.\r\nThis indeed was necessary: for the Court of Vienna had already\r\n(November 6th, 1804) framed a secret agreement with Russia to make war\r\non Napoleon if he committed any new aggression in Italy or menaced any\r\npart of the Turkish Empire.[17] Yet this act was really defensive.\r\nFrancis desired only to protect himself against Napoleon's ambition,\r\nand, had he been treated with consideration, would doubtless have\r\nclung to peace.\r\n\r\nFor a time Napoleon humoured that Court, even as regards the changes\r\nnow mooted in Italy. On January 1st, 1805, he wrote to Francis,\r\nstating that he was about to proclaim Joseph Bonaparte King of Italy,\r\nif the latter would renounce his claim to the crown of France, and so\r\nkeep the governments of France and Italy separate, as the Treaty of\r\nLunéville required; that this action would enfeeble his (Napoleon's)\r\npower, but would carry its own recompense if it proved agreeable to\r\nthe Emperor Francis.\r\n\r\nBut it soon appeared that Joseph was by no means inclined to accept\r\nthe crown of Lombardy if it entailed the sacrifice of all hope of\r\nsucceeding to the French Empire. He had already demurred to _le vilain\r\ntitre de roi_, and on January 27th announced his final rejection of\r\nthe offer. Napoleon then proposed to Louis that he should hold that\r\ncrown in trust for his son; but the suggestion at once rekindled the\r\nflames of jealousy which ever haunted Louis; and, after a violent\r\nscene, the Emperor thrust his brother from the room.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this anger was simulated. He once admitted that his rage only\r\nmounted this high--pointing to his chin; and the refusals of his\r\nbrothers were certainly to be expected. However that may be, he now\r\nresolved to assume that crown himself, appointing as Viceroy his\r\nstep-son, Eugène Beauharnais. True, he announced to the French Senate\r\nthat the realms of France and Italy would be kept separate: but\r\nneither the Italian deputies, who had been summoned to Paris to vote\r\nthis dignity to their master, nor the servile Senate, nor the rulers\r\nof Europe, were deceived. Thus, when in the early summer Napoleon\r\nreviewed a large force that fought over again in mimic war the battle\r\nof Marengo; when, amidst all the pomp and pageantry that art could\r\ndevise, he crowned himself in the cathedral of Milan with the iron\r\ncirclet of the old Lombard Kings, using the traditional formula: \"God\r\ngave it me, woe to him who touches it\"; when, finally, he incorporated\r\nthe Ligurian Republic in the French Empire, Francis of Austria\r\nreluctantly accepted the challenges thus threateningly cast down, and\r\nbegan to arm.[18] The records of our Foreign Office show conclusively\r\nthat the Hapsburg ruler felt himself girt with difficulties: the\r\nAustrian army was as yet ill organized: the reforms after which the\r\nArchduke Charles had been striving were ill received by the military\r\nclique; and the sole result had been to unsettle rather than\r\nstrengthen the army, and to break down the health of the Archduke.[19]\r\nYet the intention of Napoleon to treat Italy as a French province was\r\nso insultingly paraded that Francis felt war to be inevitable, and\r\nresolved to strike a blow while the French were still entangled in\r\ntheir naval schemes. He knew well the dangers of war; he would have\r\neagerly welcomed any sign of really peaceful intentions at Paris; but\r\nno signs were given; in fact, French agents were sent into Switzerland\r\nto intrigue for a union of that land with France. Here again the pride\r\nof the Hapsburgs was cut to the quick, and they disdained to submit to\r\nhumiliations such as were eating the heart out of the Prussian\r\nmonarchy.\r\n\r\nThe Czar, too, was far from eager for war. He had sent Novossiltzoff\r\nto Berlin _en route_ for Paris, in the hope of coming to terms with\r\nNapoleon, when the news of the annexation of Genoa ended the last\r\nhopes of a compromise. \"This man is insatiable,\" exclaimed Alexander;\r\n\"his ambition knows no bounds; he is a scourge of the world; he wants\r\nwar; well, he shall have it, and the sooner the better,\" The Czar at\r\nonce ordered all negotiations to be broken off. Novossiltzoff, on July\r\n10th, declared to Baron Hardenberg, the successor of Haugwitz at the\r\nPrussian Foreign Office, that Napoleon had now passed the utmost\r\nlimits of the Czar's patience; and he at once returned his French\r\npassports. In forwarding them to the French ambassador at Berlin,\r\nHardenberg expressed the deep regret of the Prussian monarch at the\r\nbreakdown of this most salutary negotiation--a phrase which showed\r\nthat the patience of Berlin was nearly exhausted.[20]\r\n\r\nClearly, then, the Third Coalition was not cemented by English gold,\r\nbut by Napoleon's provocations. While England and Russia found great\r\ndifficulty in coming to an accord, and Austria was arming only from\r\nfear, the least act of complaisance on his part would have unravelled\r\nthis ill-knit confederacy. But no such action was forthcoming. All his\r\nletters written in North Italy after his coronation are puffed up with\r\nincredible insolence. Along with hints to Eugène to base politics on\r\ndissimulation and to seek only to be feared, we find letters to\r\nMinisters at Paris scorning the idea that England and Russia can come\r\nto terms, and asserting that the annexation of Genoa concerns England\r\nalone; but if Austria wants to find a pretext for war, she may now\r\nfind it.\r\n\r\nThen he hurries back to Fontainebleau, covering the distance from\r\nTurin in eighty-five hours; and, after a brief sojourn at St. Cloud,\r\nhe reaches Boulogne. There, on August the 22nd, he hears that Austria\r\nis continuing to arm: a few hours later comes the news that Villeneuve\r\nhas turned back to Cadiz. Fiercely and trenchantly he resolves this\r\nfateful problem. He then sketches to Talleyrand the outlines of his\r\nnew policy. He will again press, and this time most earnestly, his\r\noffer of Hanover to Prussia as the price of her effective alliance\r\nagainst the new coalition. Perhaps this new alliance will strangle the\r\ncoalition at its birth; at any rate it will paralyze Austria.\r\nAccordingly, he despatches to Berlin his favourite aide-de-camp,\r\nGeneral Duroc, to persuade the King that his alliance will save the\r\nContinent from war.[21]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Hapsburgs were completely deceived. They imagined\r\nNapoleon to be wholly immersed in his naval enterprise, and\r\naccordingly formed a plan of campaign, which, though admirable against\r\na weak and guileless foe, was fraught with danger if the python's\r\ncoils were ready for a spring. As a matter of fact, he was far better\r\nprepared than Austria. As late as July 7th, the Court of Vienna had\r\ninformed the allies that its army would not be ready for four months;\r\nyet the nervous anxiety of the Hapsburgs to be beforehand with\r\nNapoleon led them to hurry on war: and on August 9th they secretly\r\ngave their adhesion to the Russo-British alliance.\r\n\r\nThen, too, by a strange fatuity, their move into Bavaria was to be\r\nmade with a force of only 59,000 men, while their chief masses, some\r\n92,000 strong, were launched into Italy against the strongholds on the\r\nMincio. To guard the flanks of these armies, Austria had 34,000 men in\r\nTyrol; but, apart from raw recruits, there were fewer than 20,000\r\nsoldiers in the rest of that vast empire. In fact, the success of the\r\nautumn campaign was known to depend on the help of the Russians, who\r\nwere expected to reach the banks of the Inn before the 20th of\r\nOctober, while it was thought that the French could not possibly reach\r\nthe Danube till twenty days later.[22] It was intended, however, to\r\nact most vigorously in Italy, and to wage a defensive campaign on the\r\nDanube.\r\n\r\nSuch was the plan concocted at Vienna, mainly under the influence of\r\nthe Archduke Charles, who took the command of the army in Italy, while\r\nthat of the Danube was assigned to the Archduke Ferdinand and Mack,\r\nthe new Quarter-Master-General. This soldier had hitherto enjoyed a\r\ngreat reputation in Austria, probably because he was the only general\r\nwho had suffered no great defeat. Amidst the disasters of 1797 he\r\nseemed the only man able to retrieve the past, and to be shut out from\r\ncommand by Thugut's insane jealousy of his \"transcendent\r\nabilities.\"[23] Brave he certainly was: but his mind was always swayed\r\nby preconceived notions; he belonged to the school of \"manoeuvre\r\nstrategists,\" of whom the Duke of Brunswick was the leader; and he now\r\nbegan the campaign of 1805 with the fixed purpose of holding a\r\ncommanding military position. Such a position the Emperor Francis and\r\nMack had discovered in the weak fortress of Ulm and the line of the\r\nRiver Iller. Towards these points of vantage the Austrians now began\r\nto move.\r\n\r\nThe first thing was to gain over the Elector of Bavaria. The Court of\r\nVienna, seeking to persuade or compel that prince to join the\r\nCoalition, made overtures (September 3rd to 6th) with which he dallied\r\nfor a day or two until an opportunity came of escaping to the fortress\r\nof Würzburg. Mack thereupon crossed the River Inn and sought, but in\r\nvain, to cut off the Bavarian troops from that stronghold.\r\nAccordingly, the Austrian leader marched on to Ulm, where he arrived\r\nin the middle of September; and, not satisfied with holding this\r\nadvanced position, he pushed on his outposts to the chief defiles of\r\nthe Black Forest, while other regiments held the valley of the River\r\nIller and strengthened the fortress of Memmingen. Doubtless this would\r\nhave been good strategy, had his forces been equal in numbers to those\r\nof Napoleon. At that time the Black Forest was the only  physical barrier\r\nbetween France and Southern Germany; the Rhine was then practically a\r\nFrench river; and, only by holding the passes of that range could the\r\nAustrians hope to screen Swabia from invasion on the side of Alsace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF ULM.]\r\n\r\nBut Mack forgot two essential facts. Until the Russians arrived, he\r\nwas too weak to hold so advanced a position in what was hostile\r\nground, now that Bavaria and the other South German States obeyed\r\nNapoleon's summons to range themselves on his side. Further, he was\r\ndangerously exposed on the north, as a glance at the map will show.\r\nUlm and the line of the Iller formed a strong defence against the\r\nsouth-west: but on the north that position is singularly open: it can\r\nbe turned from the valleys of the Main, the Neckar, and the Altmühl,\r\nall of which conduct an invader to the regions east of Ulm. Indeed, it\r\npasses belief how even the Aulic Council could have ignored the\r\ndangers of that position. Possibly the fact that Ulm had been stoutly\r\nheld by Kray in 1796 now induced them to overrate its present\r\nimportance; but at that time the fortified camp of Ulm was the central\r\nknot of vast operations, whereas now it was but an advanced\r\noutpost.[24] If Francis and his advisers were swayed by historical\r\nreminiscences it is strange that they forgot the fate of Melas in\r\nPiedmont. The real parallel had been provided, not by Kray, but by the\r\ngeneral who was cut off at Marengo. Indeed, in its broad outlines, the\r\ncampaign of Ulm resembles that of Marengo. Against foes who had thrust\r\ntheir columns far from their base, Napoleon now, as in 1800,\r\ndetermined to deal a crushing blow. On the part of the Austrians we\r\nnotice the same misplaced confidence, the same lack of timely news,\r\nand the same inability to understand Napoleon's plan until his\r\ndispositions are complete; while his strategy and tactics in 1805\r\nrecall to one's mind the masterly simplicity of design, the subtlety\r\nand energy of execution, which led up to his triumph in the plains of\r\nPiedmont.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the allies were dissipating their strength. A Russian corps,\r\nacting from Corfu as a base, and an English expedition from Malta,\r\nwere jointly to attack St. Cyr in the south of Italy, raise the\r\ncountry at his rear and compel him to surrender. This plan was left\r\nhelplessly flapping in the air by a convention which Napoleon imposed\r\non the Neapolitan ambassador. On September 21st Talleyrand induced\r\nthat envoy to guarantee the neutrality of the kingdom of Naples, all\r\nbelligerents being excluded from its domains. Consequently St. Cyr's\r\ncorps evacuated that land and brought a welcome reinforcement to\r\nMasséna on the Mincio. Equally skilful was Napoleon's action as\r\nregards Hanover. On that side also the allies planned a formidable\r\nexpedition. From the fortress of Stralsund in Swedish Pomerania, a\r\nforce of Russians and Swedes, which Gustavus burned to command, was to\r\nmarch into Hanover, and, when strengthened by an Anglo-Hanoverian\r\ncorps, drive the French from the Low Countries. It is curious to\r\ncontrast the cumbrous negotiations concerning this expedition--the\r\nquarrels about the command, the anxiety at the outset lest Villeneuve\r\nshould perhaps sail into the Baltic, the delays of the British War\r\nOffice, the remonstrances of the Czar, and the efforts to avert the\r\njealousy of Prussia--with the serene indifference of Napoleon as to\r\nthe whole affair. He knew full well that the war would not be decided\r\nby diversions at the heel of Italy or on the banks of the Ems, but by\r\nthe shock of great masses of men on the Danube. He denuded Hanover of\r\nFrench troops, except at its southern fortress of Hameln, so that he\r\ncould overwhelm the levies of Austria before the Russians came up. In\r\nbrief, while the Coalition sought, like a Briareus, to envelop him on\r\nall sides, he prepared to deal a blow at its heart.\r\n\r\nAs the first part of the campaign depended almost entirely on problems\r\nof time and space, it will be well to follow the chief movements of\r\nthe hostile forces somewhat closely. The Austrian plan aimed at\r\nforestalling the French in the occupation of Swabia; and its apparent\r\nsuccess puffed up Mack with boundless confidence. At Ulm he threw up\r\nextensive outworks to strengthen that obsolete fortress, extended his\r\nlines to Memmingen far on the south, and trusted that the Muscovites\r\nwould come up long before the French eagles hovered above the sources\r\nof the Danube. But at that time the Russian vanguard had not reached\r\nLinz in Upper Austria, and not before October 10th did it appear on\r\nthe banks of the River Inn.[25]\r\n\r\nFar from being the last to move, the French Emperor outstripped his\r\nenemies in the speed of his preparations. Whereas the Austrians\r\nbelieved he would not be able to reach the Danube in force before\r\nNovember 10th, he intended to have 200,000 men in Germany by September\r\n18th. But he knew not at first the full extent of his good fortune: it\r\ndid not occur to him that the Austrians would cross the Inn: all he\r\nasks Talleyrand, on August 23rd, is that such news may appear in the\r\n\"Moniteur\" as will gain him twenty days and give General Bertrand time\r\nto win over Bavaria, while \"I make my 200,000 men pirouette into\r\nGermany.\" On August 29th the _Army of England_ became the _Grand\r\nArmy_, composed of seven corps, led by Bernadotte, Marmont, Davoust,\r\nSoult, Lannes, Ney and Augereau. The cavalry was assigned to Murat;\r\nwhile Bessières was in command of the Imperial Guard, now numbering\r\nsome 10,000 men.\r\n\r\nAlready the greater part of this vast array was beginning to move\r\ninland; Davoust and Soult left some regiments, 30,000 strong, to guard\r\nthe flotilla, and Marmont detached 14,000 men to defend the coasts of\r\nHolland; but the other corps on September 2nd began their march\r\nRhine-wards in almost their full strength. On that day Bernadotte\r\nbroke up his cantonments in Hanover, and began his march towards the\r\nMain, on which so much was to turn. The Elector of Hesse-Cassel now\r\nespoused Napoleon's cause. Thus, without meeting any opposition,\r\nBernadotte's columns reached Würzburg at the close of September; there\r\nthe Elector of Bavaria welcomed the Marshal and gave him the support\r\nof his 20,000 troops; and at that stronghold he was also joined by\r\nMarmont.\r\n\r\nIn order to mislead the Austrians, Napoleon remained up to September\r\n23rd at St. Cloud or Paris; and during his stay appeared a _Senatus\r\nConsultum_ ordering that, after January 1st, 1806, France should give\r\nup its revolutionary calendar and revert to the Gregorian. He then set\r\nout for Strassburg, as though the chief blows were to be dealt through\r\nthe passes of the Black Forest at the front of Mack's line of defence;\r\nand, to encourage that general in this belief, Murat received orders\r\nto show his horsemen in the passes held by Mack's outposts, but to\r\navoid any serious engagements. This would give time for the other\r\ncorps to creep up to the enemy's rear. Mack, meanwhile, had heard of\r\nthe forthcoming junction of the French and Bavarians at Würzburg, but\r\nopined that it threatened Bohemia.[26]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, he still clung to his lines, contenting himself with\r\nsending a cavalry regiment to observe Bernadotte's movements; but\r\nneither he nor his nominal chief, the Archduke Ferdinand, divined the\r\ntruth. Indeed, so far did they rely on the aid of the Russians as to\r\norder back some regiments sent from Italy by the more sagacious\r\nArchduke Charles; but 11,000 troops from Tyrol reached the Swabian\r\narmy. That force was now spread out so as to hold the bridges of the\r\nDanube between Ingolstadt and Ulm; and on October 7th the Austrians\r\nwere disposed as follows: 18,000 men under Kienmayer were guarding\r\nIngolstadt, Neuburg, Donauwörth, Günzburg, and lesser points, while\r\nMack had about 35,000 men at Ulm and along the line of the Iller; the\r\narrival of other detachments brought the Austrian total to upwards of\r\n70,000 men. Against this long scattered line Napoleon led greatly\r\nsuperior forces.[27] The development of his plans proceeded apace.\r\nThough Prussia had proclaimed her strict neutrality, he did not\r\nscruple to violate it by sending Bernadotte's corps through her\r\nprincipality of Ansbach, which lay in their path. He charged\r\nBernadotte to \"offer many assurances favourable to Prussia, and\r\ntestify all possible affection and respect for her--and then rapidly\r\ncross her land, asserting the impossibility of doing anything else.\"\r\nAccordingly, that Marshal was lavish in his regrets and apologies, but\r\nordered his columns to defile past the battalions and squadrons of\r\nPrussia, that were powerless to resent the outrage.[28]\r\n\r\nThe news of this trespass on Prussian territory reached the ears of\r\nFrederick William at a critical time, when the Czar sent to Berlin a\r\nkind of ultimatum, intimating that, even if Prussia deserted the cause\r\nof European independence, Russian troops must nevertheless pass\r\nthrough part of Prussian Poland. Stung by this note from his usually\r\npassive demeanour, the King sent off an answer that such a step would\r\nentail a Franco-Prussian alliance against the violators of his\r\nterritory, when the news came that Napoleon had actually done at\r\nAnsbach what Alexander had announced his intention of doing in the\r\neast. The revulsion of feeling was violent: for a short space the King\r\ndeclared he would dismiss Duroc and make war on Napoleon for this\r\ninsult, but in the end he called a cabinet council and invited the\r\nCzar to come to Berlin.[29]\r\n\r\nWhile the Gallophil counsellors, Haugwitz and Lombard, were using all\r\ntheir arts to hinder the Prusso-Russian understanding, the meshes were\r\nbeing woven fast around Mack and the Archduke Ferdinand. Bernadotte's\r\ncorps, after making history in its march, was detached to the\r\nsouth-east so as to hold in check the Russian vanguard, and to give\r\nplenty of room to the troops that were to cut off Mack from Austria, a\r\nmove which may be compared with the march of Bonaparte to Milan before\r\nhe essayed the capture of Melas. Both steps bespeak his desire to have\r\nample space at his back before circling round his prey.\r\n\r\nOn October 6th the corps of Soult and Lannes, helped by Murat's\r\npowerful cavalry, cut the Austrian lines on the Danube at Donauwörth,\r\nand gained a firm footing on the right bank. Over the crossing thus\r\nsecured far in Mack's rear, the French poured in dense array, and\r\nmarched south and south-west towards the back of the Austrian\r\npositions, while Ney's corps marched to seize the chief bridges over\r\nthe Danube.\r\n\r\nA study of the processes of Mack's brain at this time is not without\r\ninterest. It shows the danger of intrusting the fate of an army to a\r\nman who cannot weigh evidence. Mack was not ignorant of the course of\r\nevents, though his news generally came late. The mischief was that his\r\nbrain warped the news. On October 6th he wrote to Vienna that the\r\nenemy seemed about to aim a blow at his communications: on October\r\n7th, when he heard of the loss of Donauwörth, he described it as an\r\nunfortunate event, which no one thought to be possible. The Archduke\r\nnow urged the need of an immediate retreat towards Munich, and marched\r\nin an easterly direction on Günzburg: another Austrian division of\r\n8,000 men moved on Wertingen, where, on October 8th, it was furiously\r\nattacked by the troops of Murat and Lannes. At first the Imperialists\r\nfirmly kept their ranks; but the unequal contest closed with a hasty\r\nflight, which left 2,000 men in the hands of the French Then Murat,\r\npressing on through the woods, cut off Mack's retreat to Augsburg. Yet\r\nthat general still took a cheerful view of his position. On that same\r\nday he wrote from Günzburg that, as soon as the enemy had passed over\r\nthe Lech, he would cross the Danube and cut their communications at\r\nNördlingen. He wrote thus when Ney's corps was striving to seize the\r\nDanube bridges below Ulm. If Mack were to march north-east against the\r\nFrench communications it was of the utmost importance for him to hold\r\nthe chief of these bridges: but Ney speedily seized three of them, and\r\non the 9th was able to draw closer the toils around Ulm.\r\n\r\nFrom his position at Augsburg the French Emperor now directed the\r\nfinal operations; and, as before Marengo, he gave most heed to that\r\nside by which he judged his enemy would strive to break through, in\r\nthis case towards Kempten and Tyrol. This would doubtless have been\r\nMack's safest course; for he was strong enough to brush aside Soult,\r\ngain Tyrol, seal up its valleys against Napoleon, and carry\r\nreinforcements to the Archduke Charles. But he was still intent on his\r\nNördlingen scheme, even after the loss of the Danube bridges exposed\r\nhis march thither to flank attacks from the four French corps now\r\nsouth of the river. Nevertheless, Napoleon's miscalculation of Mack's\r\nplans, or, as Thiers has striven to prove, a misunderstanding of his\r\norders by Murat, gave the Austrians a chance such as fortune rarely\r\nbestows.[30]\r\n\r\nIn spite of Ney's protests, one of his divisions, that led by Dupont,\r\nhad been left alone to guard the northern bank of the Danube, a\r\nposition where it might have been overwhelmed by an enterprising foe.\r\nWhat is more extraordinary, Dupont, with only 6,000 men, was charged\r\nto advance on Ulm, and carry it by storm. On the 11th he accordingly\r\nadvanced against Mack's fortified camp north of that city. The\r\nAustrians met him in force, and, despite the utmost heroism of his\r\ntroops, finally wrested the village of Hasslach from his grasp; later\r\nin the day a cloud of their horsemen, swooping round his right wing,\r\ncut up his tired troops, took 1,000 prisoners, and left 1,500 dead and\r\nwounded on the field. Among the booty was found a despatch of Napoleon\r\nordering Dupont to carry Ulm by storm--which might have shown them\r\nthat the French Emperor believed that city to be all but deserted.[31]\r\nIn truth, Napoleon's miscalculation opened for Mack a path of safety;\r\nand had he at once marched away to the north, the whole aspect of\r\naffairs might have changed. The Russian vanguard was on the banks of\r\nthe Inn: all the French, except the relics of Dupont's division, were\r\nsouth of the Danube, and a few vigorous blows at their communications\r\nmight have greatly embarrassed troops that had little artillery, light\r\nstores of ammunition, and lived almost entirely on the produce of the\r\ncountry. We may picture to ourselves the fierce blows that, in such a\r\ncase, Frederick the Great would have rained on his assailants as he\r\nwheeled round on their rear and turned their turning movements. With\r\nFrederick matched against Napoleon, the Lech and the Danube would have\r\nwitnessed a very cyclone of war.\r\n\r\nBut Mack was not Frederick: and he had to do with a foe who speedily\r\nmade good an error. On October 13th, when Mack seemed about to cut off\r\nthe French from the Main, he received news through Napoleon's spies\r\nthat the English had effected a landing at Boulogne, and a revolution\r\nhad broken out in France. The tidings found easy entrance into a brain\r\nthat had a strange bias towards pleasing falsities and rejected\r\ndisagreeable facts. At once he leaped to the conclusion that the moves\r\nof Soult, Murat, Lannes, Marmont, and Ney round his rear were merely\r\ndesperate efforts to cut back a way to Alsace. He therefore held fast\r\nto his lines, made only feeble efforts to clear the northern road, and\r\ndespatched reinforcements to Memmingen. The next day brought other\r\nnews; that Memmingen had been invested by Soult; that Ney by a\r\nbrilliant dash across the Danube at Elchingen had routed an Austrian\r\ndivision there, and was threatening Ulm from the north-east; and that\r\nthe other French columns were advancing from the south-east. Yet Mack,\r\nstill viewing these facts in the twilight of his own fancies, pictured\r\nthem as the efforts of despair, not as the drawing in of the hunter's\r\ntoils.\r\n\r\nHe was now almost alone in his reading of events. The Archduke\r\nFerdinand, though nominally in supreme command, had hitherto deferred\r\nto Mack's age and experience, as the Emperor Francis enjoined. But he\r\nnow urged the need of instantly marching away to the north with all\r\navailable forces. Still Mack clung to his notion that it was the\r\nFrench who were in sore straits; and he forbade the evacuation of Ulm;\r\nwhereupon the Archduke, with Schwarzenberg, Kollowrath, Gyulai, and\r\nall whose instincts or rank prompted and enabled them to defy the\r\nmadman's authority, assembled 1,500 horsemen and rode off by the\r\nnorthern road. It was high time; for Ney, firmly established at\r\nElchingen, was pushing on his vanguard towards the doomed city: Murat\r\nand Lannes were charged to support him on the north bank, while across\r\nthe river Marmont, and further south Soult, cut off the retreat on\r\nTyrol.\r\n\r\nAt last the scales fell from Mack's eyes. Even now he protested\r\nagainst the mere mention of surrender. But again he was disappointed.\r\nNey stormed the Michaelsberg north of Ulm, a position on which the\r\nAustrians had counted; and on October 17th the hapless commander\r\nagreed to terms of capitulation, whereby his troops were to march out\r\nand lay down their arms in six days' time, if an Austro-Russian army\r\nable to raise the siege did not come on the scene. These conditions\r\nwere afterwards altered by the captor, who, wheedling his captive with\r\na few bland words, persuaded him to surrender on the 20th on condition\r\nthat Ney and his corps remained before Ulm until the 25th. This was\r\nMack's last offence against his country and his profession; his assent\r\nto this wily compromise at once set free the other French corps for\r\noffensive operations; and that too when every day was precious to\r\nAustria, Russia, and Prussia.\r\n\r\nOn October 20th the French Emperor, with a brilliant staff, backed by\r\nthe solid wall of his Guard and flanked by eight columns of his\r\ntroops, received the homage of the vanquished. First came their\r\ncommander, who, bowed down by grief, handed his sword to the victor\r\nwith the words, \"Here is the unfortunate Mack.\" Then there filed out\r\nto the foot of the Michaelsberg 20,000 foot and 3,000 horse, who laid\r\ndown their arms before the Emperor, some with defiant rage, the most\r\npart in stolid dejection, while others flung them away with every sign\r\nof indecent joy.[32] As if the elements themselves conspired to\r\nenhance the brilliance of Napoleon's triumph, the sun, which had been\r\nobscured for days by storm-clouds and torrents of rain, now shone\r\nbrightly forth, bathing the scene in the mild radiance of autumn,\r\nlighting up the French forces disposed on the slopes of that natural\r\namphitheatre, while it cast deep shadows from the long trail of the\r\nvanquished beneath. The French were electrified by the sight: the\r\nfatigues of their forced marches through the dusty heats of September,\r\nand the slush, swamps, and torrents of the last few days were all\r\nforgotten, and they hailed with jubilant shouts the chief whose\r\nsagacity had planned and achieved a triumph hitherto unequalled in the\r\nannals of war. \"Our Emperor,\" said they, \"has found out a new way of\r\nmaking war: he no longer makes it with our arms, but with our\r\nlegs.\"[33]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the other Austrian detachments were being hunted down. Only\r\na few men escaped from Memmingen into Tyrol: the division, which, if\r\nproperly supported, might have cut a way through to Nördlingen three\r\ndays earlier, was now overwhelmed by the troops of Murat and Lannes;\r\nout of 13,000 foot-soldiers very few escaped. Most of the horsemen\r\nsucceeded in joining the Archduke Ferdinand, on whose track Murat now\r\nflung himself with untiring energy. The _beau sabreur_ swept through\r\npart of Ansbach in pursuit, came up with Ferdinand near Nuremberg, and\r\ndefeated his squadrons, their chief, with about 1,700 horse and some\r\n500 mounted artillerymen, finally reaching the shelter of the Bohemian\r\nMountains. All the rest of Mack's great array had been engulfed.\r\n\r\nThus closed the first scene of the War of the Third Coalition. Hasty\r\npreparations, rash plans, and, above all, Mack's fatal ingenuity in\r\nreading his notions into facts--these were the causes of a disaster\r\nwhich ruined the chances of the allies. The Archduke Charles, who had\r\nbeen foiled by Masséna's stubborn defence, was at once recalled from\r\nItaly in order to cover Vienna; and, worst of all, the Court of Berlin\r\nnow delayed drawing the sword.\r\n\r\nYet, even amidst the unstinted boons that she showered on Napoleon by\r\nland, Fortune rudely baffled him at sea. When he was hurrying from Ulm\r\ntowards the River Inn, to carry the war into Austria, he heard that\r\nthe French navy had been shattered. Trafalgar was fought the day after\r\nMack's army filed out of Ulm. The greatest sea-fight of the century\r\nwas the outcome of Napoleon's desire that his ships should carry\r\nsuccour to his troops in Italy. For this voyage the Emperor was about\r\nto substitute Admiral Rosily for Villeneuve: and the unfortunate\r\nadmiral, divining that resolve, sought by a bold stroke to retrieve\r\nhis fortunes. He put to sea, and Trafalgar was the result. It would be\r\nsuperfluous to describe this last and most splendid of Nelson's\r\nexploits; but a few words as to the bearing of this great victory on\r\nthe events of that time may not be out of place. It is certain that\r\nVilleneuve at Trafalgar fought under more favourable conditions than\r\nin the conflict of July 22nd. He had landed his very numerous sick,\r\nhis crews had been refreshed and reinforced, and, above all, the worst\r\nof the Spanish ships had been replaced by seaworthy and serviceable\r\ncraft. Yet out of the thirty-three sail of the line, he lost eighteen\r\nto an enemy that numbered only twenty-seven sail; and that fact alone\r\nabsolves him from the charge of cowardice in declining to face\r\nCornwallis and Calder in July with ships that were cumbered with sick\r\nand badly needed refitting.\r\n\r\nThen again: it is often stated that Trafalgar saved England from\r\ninvasion. To refute this error it is merely needful to remind the\r\nreader that all immediate fear of invasion was over, when, at the\r\nclose of August, Napoleon wheeled the Grand Army against Austria. Not\r\nuntil the Continent was conquered could the landing in Kent become\r\npracticable. That opportunity occurred two years later, after Tilsit;\r\nthen, in truth, the United Kingdom was free from panic because\r\nTrafalgar had practically destroyed the French navy. For these\r\nislands, then, the benefits of Trafalgar were prospective. But, for\r\nthe British Empire, they were immediate. Every French, Dutch, and\r\nSpanish colony that now fell into our hands was in great measure the\r\nfruit of Nelson's victory, which heralded the second and vaster stage\r\nof imperial growth.\r\n\r\nFinally, the decisive advantage which Britain now gained over Napoleon\r\nat sea compelled him, if he would realize the world-wide schemes ever\r\nclosest to his heart, to adopt the method of warfare against us which\r\nhe had all along contemplated as an effective alternative. As far back\r\nas February, 1798, he pointed out that there were three ways of\r\nattacking and ruining England, either a direct invasion, or a French\r\ncontrol of North Germany which would ruin British commerce, or an\r\nexpedition to the Indies. After Trafalgar the first of these\r\nalternatives was impossible, and the last receded for a time into the\r\nbackground. The second now took the first place in his thoughts; he\r\ncould only bring England to his feet and gain a world-empire by\r\nshutting out her goods from the whole of the Continent, and thus\r\ncondemning her to industrial strangulation. In a word, Trafalgar\r\nnecessitated the adoption of the Continental System, which was built\r\nup by the events now to be described.\r\n\r\n    Note to the Third Edition.--An American critic has charged me with\r\n    inconsistency in saying that the Third Coalition was not built up\r\n    by English gold, because I state (p. 5) that the first advances\r\n    were made by England to Russia. I ought to have used the phrase\r\n    \"the first _written_ proposals that I have found were made,\" etc.\r\n    Czartoryski's \"Memoirs\" (vol. ii., chs. ii.-iii.), to which I\r\n    referred my readers for details, show clearly that Alexander and\r\n    his advisers looked on a rupture with France as inevitable, but\r\n    wished to temporize for some three months or so, until certain\r\n    matters were cleared up; they therefore cautiously sounded the\r\n    position at Vienna and London. This passage from Czartoryski (vol.\r\n    ii., ch. iii.) proves that Russia wanted the English alliance:\r\n\r\n    \"After the diplomatic rupture consequent upon the execution of the\r\n    Duc d'Enghien, it became indispensable to come to an understanding\r\n    with the only Power, except Russia, which thought herself strong\r\n    enough to contend with France--to ascertain as thoroughly as\r\n    possible what were her inclinations and designs, the principles of\r\n    her policy, and those which she could be led to adopt in certain\r\n    contingencies. It would have been a great advantage to obtain the\r\n    concurrence in our views of so powerful a State as England, and to\r\n    strive with her for the same objects; but for this it was\r\n    necessary, not only to make sure of her present inclinations, but\r\n    to weigh well the possibilities of the future after the death of\r\n    George III. and the fall of the Pitt Ministry. We had to make\r\n    England understand that the wish to fight Napoleon was not in\r\n    itself sufficient to establish an indissoluble bond between her\r\n    Government and that of St. Petersburg....\"\r\n\r\n    In \"F.O.,\" Russia, No. 55, is a despatch of our ambassador at St.\r\n    Petersburg, Admiral Warren, of June 30, 1804, in which he reports\r\n    Czartoryski's concern at rumours of negotiations between England\r\n    and France: \"The prince [Czartoryski] remarked that he could not\r\n    suppose, after what had passed between the two Courts, and the\r\n    manner in which the Emperor [Alexander] had explained himself to\r\n    England, and after the measures which Russia had since proposed,\r\n    that Great Britain would make a peace at once by herself.\"\r\n\r\n    Of these earlier negotiations I have found no trace; but obviously\r\n    the first proposals for an alliance must have come from Russia.\r\n    Sweden was the first to propose a monarchical league against\r\n    Napoleon. (See my article in the \"Revue Napoléonienne\" for June,\r\n    1902.)\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nAUSTERLITZ\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the capitulation of Ulm, the French Emperor marched against the\r\nRussian army, which, as he told his troops, _English gold had brought\r\nfrom the ends of the earth._ As is generally the case with coalitions,\r\nneither of the allies was ready in time or sent its full quota. In\r\nplace of the 54,000 which Alexander had covenanted to send to\r\nAustria's support, he sent as yet only 46,000; and of these 8,000 were\r\ndetached into Podolia in order to watch the warlike moves of the\r\nTurks, whom the French had stirred up against the Muscovite.\r\n\r\nBut Alexander had another and weightier excuse for not denuding his\r\nrealm of troops, namely, the ambiguous policy of Prussia. Up to the\r\nmiddle of October this great military Power clung to her somewhat\r\nthreatening neutrality, an attitude not unlike that of the\r\nScandinavian States, which, in 1691, remained deaf to the entreaties\r\nof William of Orange to take up the cause of European freedom against\r\nLouis XIV., and were dubbed the Third Party. It would seem, however,\r\nthat the Prussian King had some grounds for his conduct: he feared the\r\nPolish influence which Czartoryski wielded over the Czar, and saw in\r\nthe Russian request for a right of way through Prussian Poland a\r\ndeep-laid scheme for the seizure of that territory. Indeed, the\r\nletters of Czartoryski prove that such a plan was pressed forward, and\r\nfound much favour with the Czar, though at the last moment he\r\nprudently shelved it.[34]\r\n\r\nFor a time the hesitations of Prussia were ended by Napoleon's\r\nviolation of Ansbach, and by Alexander's frank explanations at\r\nPotsdam; but meanwhile the delays caused by Prussia's suspicions had\r\nmarred the Austrian plans. A week's grace granted by Napoleon, or a\r\nweek gained by the Russians on their actual marching time, would have\r\naltered the whole situation in Bavaria--and Prussia would have drawn\r\nthe sword against France to avenge the insult at Ansbach.\r\n\r\nOn October 10th Hardenberg informed the Austrian ambassador,\r\nMetternich, that Frederick William was on the point of declaring for\r\nthe allies. Nothing, however, was done until Alexander reached\r\nPotsdam, and the first news that he received on his arrival (October\r\n25th) was of the surrender of Ulm. Nevertheless, the influence of the\r\nCzar checkmated the efforts of Haugwitz and the French party, and kept\r\nthat Government to its resolve, which on November 3rd took the form of\r\nthe Treaty of Potsdam between Russia, Austria, and Prussia. Frederick\r\nWilliam pledged himself to offer the armed mediation of Prussia, and,\r\nif it were refused by Napoleon, to join the allies. The Prussian\r\ndemands were as follows: indemnities for the King of Sardinia in\r\nLombardy, Liguria, and Parma; the independence of Naples, Holland,\r\nGermany, and Switzerland; and the Mincio as Austria's boundary in\r\nItaly.[35]\r\n\r\nAn envoy was to offer these terms to Napoleon, and to bring back a\r\ndefinite answer within one month from the time of his departure, and\r\nin the meantime 180,000 Prussians prepared to threaten his flank and\r\nrear. Alexander also secretly pledged himself to use his influence\r\nwith George III. to gain Hanover for Frederick William at the close of\r\nthe war, England meanwhile subsidizing Prussia and her Saxon allies on\r\nthe usual scale. The Czar afterwards accompanied the King and Queen to\r\nthe crypt of the Great Frederick, kissed the tomb, and, as he took his\r\nleave of their majesties, cast a significant look at the altar.[36]\r\n\r\nDid he fear the peace-loving tendencies of the King, or the treachery\r\nof Haugwitz? It is difficult to see good faith in every detail of the\r\ntreaty. Apart from the strange assumption that England would subsidize\r\nPrussia and also give up Hanover, the manner in which the armed\r\nmediation was to be offered left several loopholes for escape. After\r\nthe surrender of Ulm, speedy and vigorous action was needed to restore\r\nthe balance; yet a month's delay was bargained for. Then, too,\r\nHaugwitz, who was charged with this most important mission, deferred\r\nhis departure for ten days on the plea that Prussia's forces could not\r\nbe ready before the middle of December. Such was the statement of the\r\nleisurely Duke of Brunswick; but it can scarcely be reconciled with\r\nFrederick William's threat, a month earlier, of immediate war against\r\nthe Russians if they entered his lands. Yet now that monarch approved\r\nof the delay. Haugwitz therefore did not set out till November 14th,\r\nand by that time Napoleon was master of Vienna, and the allies were\r\nfalling back into Moravia.\r\n\r\nWe now turn to the scene of war. For the first time in modern history\r\nthe Hapsburg capital had fallen into the hands of a foreign foe.\r\nNapoleon now installed himself at the stately palace of Schönbrunn,\r\nwhile Francis was fleeing to Olmütz and the Archdukes Charles and John\r\nwere struggling in the defiles of the Alps to disengage themselves\r\nfrom the vanguard of Masséna. The march of the French on Vienna, and\r\nthence northwards to Brünn, led to only one incident of general\r\ninterest, namely, the filching away from the Austrians of the bridge\r\nover the Danube to the north of Vienna. As it nears the city, that\r\ngreat river spreads out into several channels, the largest being on\r\nthe north. The wooden bridge further up the river having been burnt by\r\nthe Russian rearguard, there remained only the bridge or bridges,\r\nopposite the city, on the possession of which Napoleon set much store.\r\nHe therefore charged Murat and Lannes to secure them if possible.\r\n\r\nMurat was smarting under the Emperor's displeasure for a rash advance\r\non Vienna which had wellnigh cost the existence of Mortier's corps on\r\nthe other bank. Indeed, only by the most resolute bravery did the\r\nremnant of that corps hew its way through overwhelming numbers. Murat,\r\nwho should have kept closely in touch with Mortier by a flotilla of\r\nboats, was eager to retrieve his fault, and, with Lannes, Bertrand,\r\nand an officer of engineers, he now approached the first part of the\r\nbridge as if for a parley during an informal armistice which had just\r\nbeen discussed but not concluded. The French Marshals had disposed the\r\ngrenadiers of General Oudinot, a body of men as renowned as their\r\nleader for fighting qualities, behind some thickets that spread along\r\nthe southern bank and partly screened the approach. The plank\r\nbarricade at the southern end was now thrown down, and the four\r\nFrenchmen advanced. An Austrian mounted sentinel fired his carbine and\r\ngalloped away to the main bridge; thereupon the four men advanced,\r\ncalled to the officer there in command as if for a parley, and stopped\r\nhim in the act of firing the gunpowder stored beneath the bridge, with\r\nthe assurance that an armistice was, or was about to be, concluded.\r\n\r\nReaching the northern end they repeated their tale, and claimed to see\r\nthe commander. While the defenders were hesitating, Oudinot's\r\ngrenadiers were rapidly marching forward. As soon as they were seen,\r\nthe Austrians prepared once more to fire the bridge. Again they were\r\nimplored to desist, as peace was as good as signed. But when the\r\ngrenadiers had reached the northern bank, the mask was dropped: fresh\r\ntroops were hurrying up and the chance of saving the bridge from their\r\ngrasp was now lost. By these means did Murat and Lannes secure an\r\nundisputed passage to the northern bank, for which four years later\r\nthe French had desperately to fight. Napoleon was delighted at Murat's\r\nexploit, which greatly furthered his pursuit of the allies, and he at\r\nonce restored that Marshal to high favour. But those who placed\r\ngentlemanly conduct above the glamour of a trickster's success were\r\nnot slow, even then, to express their disapproval of this act of\r\nperfidy.[37]\r\n\r\nThe prolonged retreat into Moravia, the unexpected feebleness of the\r\nHapsburg arms, and the lack of supplies weighed heavily on Alexander's\r\nspirits, as is shown in his letter from Olmütz to the King of Prussia\r\non November 19th: \"Our position is more than critical: we stand almost\r\nalone against the French, who are close on our heels. As for the\r\nAustrian army, it does not exist.... If your armies advance, the whole\r\nposition will alter at once.\"[38] A few days later, however, when\r\n27,000 more Russians were at hand, including his Imperial Guard, the\r\nCzar passed from the depths of depression to the heights of\r\nconfidence. The caution of his wary commander, Kutusoff, who urged a\r\nFabian policy of delay and retreat, now began to weary him. To retire\r\ninto northern Hungary seemed ignominious. And though Frederick William\r\nheld to his resolve of not drawing the sword before December 15th, and\r\nby that time the Archduke Charles with a large army was expected below\r\nVienna, yet the susceptible young autocrat spurned the behests of\r\nirksome prudence. In vain did Kutusoff and Schwarzenberg urge the need\r\nof delay and retreat: Alexander gave more heed to the rash counsels of\r\nhis younger officers. An advance was ordered on Brünn, and a\r\nsuccessful cavalry skirmish at Wischau confirmed the Czar in his\r\nchange from the strategy of Fabius to that of Varro.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, who was now at Brünn, had already divined this change in the\r\ntemper of his foe, and called back his men with the express purpose of\r\nhumouring Alexander's latest mood and tempting him on to a decisive\r\nbattle. He saw clearly the advantage of fighting at once. The renewed\r\noffers of an armistice, which he received from the prudent Francis,\r\nmight alone have convinced him of this; and they came in time to give\r\nhim an argument, telling enough to daunt the Prussian envoy, who was\r\nnow drawing near to his headquarters.\r\n\r\nAfter proceeding towards Vienna and being sent back to Brünn, Haugwitz\r\narrived there on November 29th.[39] Of the four hours' private\r\nconference that ensued with Napoleon we have but scanty records, and\r\nthose by Haugwitz himself, who had every reason for warping the truth.\r\nHe states that he was received with icy coldness, and at once saw that\r\nthe least threat of hostile pressure by Prussia would drive Napoleon\r\nto make a separate peace with Austria. But after the first hour the\r\nEmperor appeared to thaw: he discussed the question of a Continental\r\npeace and laid aside all resentment at Prussia's conduct: finally, he\r\ngave a general assent to her proposals, on two conditions, namely,\r\nthat the allied force then in Hanover should not be allowed by Prussia\r\nto invade Holland, and that the French garrison in the fortress of\r\nHameln, now compassed about by Prussians, should be provisioned. To\r\nboth of these requests Haugwitz assented, and pledged the word of his\r\nKing, an act of presumption which that monarch was to repudiate.\r\n\r\nWhile exceeding his instructions on this side, Haugwitz did\r\npractically nothing to advance the chief business of his mission.\r\nEither his own fears, or the crafty mixture of threats and flattery\r\nthat cajoled so many envoys, led him to neglect the interests of\r\nPrussia, and to play into the hands of the very man whose ambition he\r\nwas sent to check. After the interview, when the envoy had retired to\r\nhis lodging, Caulaincourt came up in haste to warn him that a battle\r\nwas imminent, that his personal safety might be endangered, and that\r\nNapoleon requested him to repair to Vienna, where he might consult\r\nwith Talleyrand on affairs of State. Horses and an escort were ready,\r\nand Haugwitz set out for that city, where he arrived on November 30th,\r\nonly to find that Talleyrand was strictly forbidden to do more than\r\nentertain him with commonplaces. Thus, the all-important question as\r\nto the action of Prussia's legions was again postponed, even when\r\n150,000 Prussians and Saxons were ready to march against the French\r\ncommunications.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's letter of November 30th to Talleyrand reveals his secret\r\nanxiety at this time. In truth, the crisis was terrible. With a\r\nsuperior force in front, with the Archdukes Ferdinand and Charles\r\nthreatening to raise Bohemia and Hungary on his flanks, while two\r\nPrussian armies were about to throw themselves on his rear, his\r\nposition was fully as serious as that of Hannibal before Cannæ, from\r\nwhich the Carthaginian freed himself only by that staggering blow. Did\r\nthat example inspire the French Emperor, or did he take counsel from\r\nhis own boundless resources of brain and will? Certain it is that,\r\nafter a passing fit of discouragement, he braced himself for a final\r\neffort, and staked all on the effect of one mighty stroke. In order to\r\nhurry on the battle he feigned discouragement and withdrew his lines\r\nfrom Austerlitz to the Goldbach. Already he had sent General Savary to\r\nthe Czar with proposals for a short truce.[40] The word truce now\r\nspelt guile; its offer through Savary, whose hands were stained with\r\nthe blood of the Duc d'Enghien, was in itself an insult, and Alexander\r\ngave that envoy the coolest reception. In return he sent Prince\r\nDolgoruki, the leader of the bellicose youths now high in favour, who\r\nproudly declared to the French Emperor the wishes of his master for\r\nthe independence of Europe--adding among other things that Holland\r\nmust be free and have Belgium added to it.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion greatly amused Napoleon, who replied that Russia ought\r\nnow to think of her own advantages on the side of Turkey. The answer\r\nconvinced the Czar that Napoleon dreaded a conflict in his dangerously\r\nadvanced position. He knew not his antagonist's resources. Napoleon\r\nhad hurried up every available regiment. Bernadotte's corps was\r\nrecalled from the frontier of Bohemia; Friant's division of 4,000 men\r\nwas ordered up from Pressburg; and by forced marches it also was nigh\r\nat hand on the night of December 1st, worn with fatigue after covering\r\nan immense space in two days, but ready to do excellent service on the\r\nmorrow.[41] By this timely concentration Napoleon raised his forces to\r\na total of at least 73,000 men, while the enemy founded their plan on\r\nthe assumption that Napoleon had less than 50,000, and would scarcely\r\nresist the onset of superior forces.\r\n\r\nTheir plan was rash, even for an army which numbered about 80,000 men.\r\nThe Austrian General Weyrother had convinced the Czar that an\r\nenergetic advance of his left wing, which rested on the southern spurs\r\nof the Pratzenberg, would force back Napoleon's right, which was\r\nranged between the villages of Kobelnitz and Sokelnitz, and so roll up\r\nhis long line that stretched beyond Schlapanitz. This move, if\r\nsuccessful, would not only win the day, but decide the campaign, by\r\ncutting off the French from their supplies coming from the south and\r\ndriving them into the exhausted lands around Olmütz. Such was\r\nWeyrother's scheme, which enchanted the Czar and moved the fears of\r\nthe veteran Kutusoff: it was expounded to the Russian and Austrian\r\ngenerals after midnight on December the 2nd. Strong in the great\r\ncentral hill, the Pratzenberg, and the cover of its village at the\r\nfoot, the Czar had no fear for his centre: to his right or northern\r\nwing he gave still less heed, as it rested firmly on villages and was\r\npowerful in cavalry and artillery; but his left wing, comprising fully\r\ntwo-fifths of the allied army, was expected easily to defeat\r\nNapoleon's weak and scattered right, and so decide the day. Kutusoff\r\nsaw the peril of massing so great a force there and weakening the\r\ncentre, but sadly held his peace.\r\n\r\nNapoleon had already divined their secret. In his order of battle he\r\ntook his troops into his confidence, telling them that, while the\r\nenemy marched to turn his right, they would expose their flank to his\r\nblows. To announce this beforehand was strangely bold, and it has been\r\nthought that he had the plan from some traitor on the enemy's staff.\r\nNo proof of this has been given; and such an explanation seems\r\nsuperfluous to those who have observed Napoleon's uncanny power of\r\nfathoming his adversary's designs. The idea of withdrawing one wing in\r\norder to tempt the foe unduly to prolong his line on that side, and\r\nthen to crush it at the centre, or sever it from the centre, is common\r\nboth to Castiglione and Austerlitz. It is true, the peculiarities of\r\nthe ground, the ardour of the Russian attack, and the vastness of the\r\noperations lent to the present conflict a splendour and a horror which\r\nCastiglione lacked. But the tactics which won both battles were\r\nfundamentally the same.\r\n\r\nHe had studied the ground in front of Austerlitz; and the priceless\r\ngift of strategic imagination revealed to him what a rash and showy\r\nleader would be certain to do on that ground;[42] he tempted him to\r\nit, and the announcement of the enemy's plan to the French soldiery\r\nsupplied the touch of good comradeship which insured their utmost\r\ndevotion on the morrow. At midnight, as he returned from visiting the\r\noutposts, the soldiers greeted him with a weird illumination: by a\r\ncommon impulse they tore down the straw from their rude shelters and\r\nheld aloft the burning wisps on long poles, dancing the while in\r\nhonour of the short gray-coated figure, and shouting, \"It is the\r\nanniversary of the coronation. Long live the Emperor.\" Thus was the\r\ngreat day ushered in. The welkin glowed with this tribute of an army's\r\nheroworship: the frost-laden clouds echoed back the multitudinous\r\nacclaim; and the Russians, as they swung forward their left, surmised\r\nthat, after all, the French would stand their ground and fight, whilst\r\nothers saw in the flare a signal that Napoleon was once more about to\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nDecember the 2nd may well be the most famous day of the Napoleonic\r\ncalendar: it was the day of his coronation, it was the day of\r\nAusterlitz, and, a generation later, another Napoleon chose it for his\r\n_coup d'état_. The \"sun of Austerlitz,\" which the nephew then hailed,\r\nlooked down on a spectacle far different from that which he wished to\r\ngild with borrowed splendour. Struggling dimly through dense banks of\r\nmist, it shone on the faces of 73,000 Frenchmen resolved to conquer or\r\nto die: it cast weird shadows before the gray columns of Russia and\r\nthe white-coats of Austria as they pressed in serried ranks towards\r\nthe frozen swamps of the Goldbach. At first the allies found little\r\nopposition; and Kienmayer's horse cleared the French from Tellnitz and\r\nthe level ground beyond. But Friant's division, hurrying up from the\r\nwest, restored the fight and drove the first assailants from the\r\nvillage. Others, however, were pressing on, twenty-nine battalions\r\nstrong, and not all the tenacious bravery of Davoust's soldiery\r\navailed to hold that spot. Nor was it necessary. Napoleon's plan was\r\nto let the allied left compromise itself on this side, while he rained\r\nthe decisive blows at its joint with the centre on the southern spur\r\nof the Pratzenberg.\r\n\r\nFor this reason he reduced Davoust to defensive tactics, for which his\r\nstubborn methodical genius eminently fitted him, until the French\r\ncentre had forced the Russians from the plateau. Opposite or near that\r\nheight he had posted the corps of Soult and Bernadotte, supporting\r\nthem with the grenadiers of Oudinot and the Imperial Guard.\r\nConfronting these imposing forces was the Russian centre, weakened by\r\nthe heavy drafts sent towards Tellnitz, but strong in its position and\r\nin the experience of its leader Kutusoff. Caution urged him to hold\r\nback his men to the last moment, until the need of giving cohesion to\r\nthe turning movement led the Czar impatiently to order his advance.\r\nScarcely had the Russians descended beyond Pratzen when they were\r\nexposed to a furious attack. Vandamme, noted even then as one of the\r\nhardest hitters in the army, was leading his division of Soult's corps\r\nup the northern slopes of the plateau; by a sidelong slant his men cut\r\noff a detachment of Russians in the village, and, aided by the brigade\r\nof Thiébault, swarmed up the hill at a speed which surprised and\r\nunsteadied its defenders. Oudinot's grenadiers and the Imperial Guard\r\nwere ready to sustain Soult: but the men of his corps had the glory of\r\nseizing the plateau and driving back the Russians. Yet these returned\r\nto the charge. Alexander and Kutusoff saw the importance of the\r\nheights, and brought up a great part of their reserves. Soon the\r\ndivisions of  Vandamme and St. Hilaire were borne back;\r\nand it needed all the grand fighting powers of their troops to hold up\r\nagainst the masses of howling Russians. For two hours the battle there\r\nswayed to and fro; and Thiébault has censured Napoleon for the lack of\r\nsupport, and Soult for his apathy, during this soldiers' battle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF AUSTERLITZ]\r\n\r\nBut the Emperor was awaiting the development of events on the wings. A\r\nsharp fight of all arms was raging on the plain further to the north.\r\nThere the allies at first gained ground, the Austrian horse well\r\nmaintaining its old fame: but the infantry of Lannes' corps, supported\r\nby powerful artillery ranged on a small conical hill, speedily checked\r\ntheir charges; the French horse, marshalled by Murat and Kellermann\r\nsomewhat after the fashion of the British cavalry at Waterloo, so as\r\nto support the squares and dash through the intervals in pursuit, soon\r\nmade most effective charges upon the dense squadrons of the allies,\r\nand finally a general advance of Lannes and Murat overthrew the\r\nwavering lines opposite and chased them back towards the small town of\r\nAusterlitz.\r\n\r\nThus by noon the lines of fighting swerved till they ranged along the\r\ncourse of the Littawa stream, save where the allies had thrust forward\r\na long and apparently successful wedge beyond Tellnitz. The Czar saw\r\nthe danger of this almost isolated wing, and sought to keep touch with\r\nit; but the defects of the allied plan were now painfully apparent.\r\nNapoleon, having the interior lines, while his foes were scattered\r\nover an irregular arc, could reinforce his hard-pressed right. There\r\nDavoust was being slowly borne back, when the march of Duroc with part\r\nof the Imperial Guard restored the balance on that side. The French\r\ncentre also was strengthened by the timely arrival of part of\r\nBernadotte's corps. That Marshal detached a division towards the\r\nnorthern slopes of the plateau; for he divined that there his master\r\nwould need every man to deal the final blows.[43]\r\n\r\nIn truth, Alexander and Kutusoff were struggling hard to regain the\r\nPratzenberg. Four times did the Muscovites fling themselves on the\r\nFrench centre, and not without some passing gleams of success. Here\r\noccurred the most famous cavalry fight of the war. The Russian Guards,\r\nmounted on superb horses, had cut up two of Vandamme's battalions,\r\nwhen Rapp rode to their rescue with the chasseurs of the French\r\nImperial Guard. These choice bodies of horsemen met with a terrible\r\nshock, which threw the Russians into disorder. Rallied by other\r\nsquadrons, these now overthrew their assailants and seemed about to\r\noverpower them, when Bessières with the heavy cavalry of the Guard\r\nfell on the flank of the Muscovite horse and drove their lines, horse\r\nand foot, into the valley beyond.\r\n\r\nAssured of his centre, Napoleon now launched Soult's corps down the\r\nsouth-western spurs of the plateau upon the flank and rear of the\r\nallied left: this unexpected onset was decisive: the French, sweeping\r\ndown the slopes with triumphant shouts, cut off several battalions on\r\nthe banks of the Goldbach, scattered others in headlong flight towards\r\nBrünn, and drove the greater part down to the Lake of Tellnitz. Here\r\nthe troubles of the allies culminated. A few gained the narrow marshy\r\ngap between the two lakes; but dense bodies found no means of escape\r\nsave the frozen surface of the upper lake. In some parts the ice bore\r\nthe weight of the fugitives; but where they thronged pell-mell, or\r\nwhere it was cut up by the plunging fire of the French cannon on the\r\nheights, crowds of men sank to destruction. The victors themselves\r\nstood aghast at this spectacle; and, for the credit of human nature be\r\nit said, many sought to save their drowning foes. Among others, the\r\nyouthful Marbot swam to a floe to help bring a Russian officer to\r\nland, a chivalrous exploit which called forth the praise of Napoleon.\r\nThe Emperor brought this glorious day to a fitting close by visiting\r\nthe ground most thickly strewn with his wounded, and giving directions\r\nfor their treatment or removal. As if satisfied with the victory, he\r\ngave little heed to the pursuit. In truth, never since Marlborough cut\r\nthe Franco-Bavarian army in twain at Blenheim, had there been a battle\r\nso terrible in its finale, and so decisive in its results as this of\r\nthe three Emperors, which cost the allies 33,000 men and 186 cannon.\r\n\r\nThe Emperors Alexander and Francis fled eastwards into the night.\r\nBetween them there was now a tacit understanding that the campaign was\r\nat an end. On that night Francis sent proposals for a truce; and in\r\ntwo days' time Napoleon agreed to an armistice (signed on December\r\n6th) on condition that Francis would send away the Russian army and\r\nentirely exclude that of Prussia from his territories. A contribution\r\nof 100,000,000 francs was also laid upon the Hapsburg dominions. On\r\nthe next day Alexander pledged himself to withdraw his army at once;\r\nand Francis proceeded to treat for peace with Napoleon. This was an\r\ninfraction of the treaties of the Third Coalition, which prescribed\r\nthat no separate peace should be made.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, the conduct of the Hapsburgs was pardonable:\r\nbut the seeming break-up of the coalition furnished the Court of\r\nBerlin with a good reason for declining to bear the burden alone. It\r\nwas not Austerlitz that daunted Frederick William; for, after hearing\r\nof that disaster, he wrote that he would be true to his pledge given\r\non November 3rd. But then, on the decisive day (December 15th), came\r\nthe news of the defection of Austria, the withdrawal of Alexander's\r\narmy, and the closing of the Hapsburg lands to a Prussian force. These\r\nfacts absolved Frederick William from his obligations to those Powers,\r\nand allowed him with perfect good faith to keep his sword in the\r\nscabbard. The change, it is true, sadly dulled the warlike ardour of\r\nhis army; but it could not be called desertion of Russia and\r\nAustria.[44] The disgrace came later, when, on Christmas Day, Haugwitz\r\nreached Berlin, and described to the King and Ministers his interview\r\nwith Napoleon in the palace of Schönbrunn, and the treaty which the\r\nvictor then and there offered to Prussia at the sword's point.\r\n\r\nFor most men a great victory such as Austerlitz would have brought a\r\nbrief spell of rest, especially after the ceaseless toils and\r\nanxieties of the previous fortnight. Yet now, after ridding himself of\r\nall fear of Austria, Napoleon at once used every device of his subtle\r\nstatecraft to dissolve the nascent coalition. And Fortune had willed\r\nthat, when flushed with triumph, he should have to deal with a\r\ntimorous time-server.\r\n\r\nIt is the curse of a policy of keeping up a dainty balance in a\r\nhurricane that it unmans the balancer, until at last the peacemaker\r\nresembles a juggler. A decade of compromise and evasion of\r\ndifficulties had enfeebled the spirit of Prussia, until the hardest\r\ntrial for her King was to take any step that could not be retraced. He\r\nhad often spoken \"feelingly, if not energetically,\" of the\r\npredicaments of his position between France, England, and Russia.[45]\r\nAnd, as in the case of that other _bon père de famille_, Louis XVI.,\r\nwhom Nature framed for a farmhouse and Fate tossed into a revolution,\r\nhis lack of foresight and resolution took the heart out of his\r\nadvisers and turned statesmen into trimmers. Even before the news of\r\nAusterlitz reached the ears of Talleyrand and Haugwitz at Vienna, the\r\nbearer of Prussia's ultimatum was posing as the friend of France. On\r\nall occasions he wore the cordon of the Legion of Honour; and while\r\nthe hosts of East and West were in the death-grapple on the\r\nPratzenberg, he strove to convince the French Foreign Minister that\r\nthe Prussians had entered Hanover only in order to keep the peace in\r\nNorth Germany; that, as Russians had traversed Prussian territory, the\r\nFrench would, of course, be equally free to do so; that Frederick\r\nWilliam objected to the descent of any English force in Hanover, which\r\nbelonged _de facto_ to France; and finally that the Treaty of Potsdam\r\nwas not a treaty at all, but merely a declaration with the \"offer of\r\nPrussia's good offices and of mediation, but without any mingling of\r\nhostile intentions.\" Well might Talleyrand write to Napoleon: \"I am\r\nvery satisfied with M. Haugwitz.\"[46]\r\n\r\nNapoleon's victory over Prussian diplomacy was therefore won, even\r\nbefore the lightning-stroke of Austerlitz blasted the Third Coalition.\r\nHaugwitz began his conference with the victor at Schönbrunn on\r\nDecember 13th, by offering Frederick William's congratulations on his\r\ntriumph at Austerlitz, to which the Emperor replied by a sarcastic\r\nquery whether, if the result of that battle had been different, he\r\nwould have spoken at all about the friendship of his master.[47] After\r\nthus disconcerting the envoy and upbraiding him with the Treaty of\r\nPotsdam, Napoleon unmasked his battery by offering Prussia the\r\nElectorate of Hanover in return for the comparatively petty sacrifices\r\nof Ansbach to Bavaria, and Cleves and Neufchâtel to France. For the\r\nloss of these outlying districts Prussia could buy that long-coveted\r\nland.[48] The envoy was dazzled by this glittering offer, and by\r\nothers that followed. The conqueror proposed an offensive and\r\ndefensive alliance, whereby France and Prussia mutually guaranteed\r\ntheir lands along with prospective additions in Germany and Italy; and\r\nthe Court of Berlin was also to uphold the independence of Turkey.\r\n\r\nSuch were the terms that Napoleon peremptorily required Haugwitz to\r\nsign within a few hours: and the bearer of Prussia's ultimatum on\r\nDecember 15th signed this Treaty of Schönbrunn, which degraded the\r\nwould-be arbitress of Europe to her former position of well-fed\r\nfollower of France. This was the news which Haugwitz brought back to\r\nhis astonished King. His reception was of the coolest; for Frederick\r\nWilliam was an honest man, who sought peace, prosperity, and the\r\nwelfare of his people, and now saw himself confronted by the\r\nalternative of war or national humiliation. In truth, every turn and\r\ndouble of his course was now leading him deeper into the discredit and\r\nruin which will be described in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nLeaving for the present that unhappy King amidst his increasing\r\nperplexities, we return to the affairs of Austria. Mack's disaster\r\nalone had cast that Government into the depths of despair, and we\r\nlearn from Lord Gower, our ambassador at St. Petersburg, that he had\r\nseen copies of letters written by the Emperor Francis to Napoleon\r\n\"couched in terms of humility and submission unworthy of a great\r\nmonarch,\" to which the latter replied in a tone of superiority and\r\naffected commiseration, and with a demand for the Hapsburg lands in\r\nVenetia and Swabia.[49]\r\n\r\nThe same tone of whining dejection was kept up by Cobenzl and other\r\nAustrian Ministers, even before Austerlitz, when Prussia was on the\r\npoint of drawing the sword; and they sent offers of peace, when it was\r\nrather for their foe to sue for it. After that battle, and, still more\r\nso, after signing the armistice of December 6th, they were at the\r\nconqueror's mercy; and Napoleon knew it. After probing the inner\r\nweakness of the Berlin Court, he now pressed with merciless severity\r\non the Hapsburgs. He proposed to tear away their Swabian and Tyrolese\r\nlands and their share of the spoils of Venice. In vain did the\r\nAustrian plenipotentiaries struggle against these harsh terms,\r\npleading for Tyrol and Dalmatia, and pointing out the impossibility of\r\nraising 100,000,000 francs from territories ravaged by war. In vain\r\ndid they proffer a claim to Hanover for one of their Archdukes: though\r\nTalleyrand urged the advantage of this step as dissolving the\r\nAnglo-Austrian alliance, yet Napoleon refused to hear of it; for at\r\nthat time he was offering that Electorate to Haugwitz.[50] Still less\r\nwould he hear a word in favour of the Court of Naples, whose conduct\r\nhad aroused his resentment. The utmost that the Austrian envoys could\r\nwring from him was the reduction of the war contribution to 40,000,000\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\nThe terms finally arranged in the Treaty of Pressburg (December 26th,\r\n1805) may be thus summarized: Austria recognized the recent\r\nacquisitions and changes of title made by Napoleon in Italy, and ceded\r\nto him her parts of Venetia, Istria, and Dalmatia. She recognized the\r\ntitle of King now bestowed by Napoleon on the Electors of Bavaria and\r\nWürtemberg, a change which was not to invalidate their membership of\r\nthe \"Germanic Confederation.\" To those potentates and to the Elector\r\n(now Grand Duke) of Baden, the Hapsburgs ceded all their scattered\r\nSwabian domains, while Bavaria also gained Tyrol and Vorarlberg. As a\r\nslight compensation for these grievous losses, Austria gained\r\nSalzburg, whose Elector was to receive from Bavaria the former\r\nprincipality of Würzburg. The domains and revenues of the Teutonic and\r\nMaltese Orders were secularized, so as to furnish appanages to some\r\nother princes of the Hapsburg House; and another blow was dealt at the\r\nGermanic system by the declaration that Napoleon guaranteed the full\r\nand entire sovereignty of the rulers of Bavaria, Würtemberg, and\r\nBaden. In fact, as will appear in the next chapter, Napoleon now\r\nusurped the place in Germany previously held by the Hapsburgs, and\r\nextended his influence as far east as the River Inn, and, on the\r\nsouth, down to the remote city of Ragusa on the Adriatic.\r\n\r\nBut it is one thing to win a brilliant diplomatic triumph, and quite\r\nanother thing to secure a firm and lasting peace. The Peace of\r\nPressburg raised Napoleon to heights of power never dreamt of by Louis\r\nXIV.: but his pre-eminence was at best precarious. When by moderate\r\nterms he might have secured the alliance of Austria and severed her\r\nfriendship with England, he chose to place his heel on her neck and\r\ndrive her to secret but irreconcilable hatred.\r\n\r\nAnd his choice was deliberate. Two months earlier, Talleyrand had sent\r\nhim a memorandum on the subject of a Franco-Austrian alliance, which\r\nis instinct with statesmanlike foresight. He stated that there were\r\nfour Great Powers--France, Great Britain, Russia, and Austria: he\r\nexcluded Prussia, whose rise to greatness under Frederick the Great\r\nwas but temporary. Austria, he claimed, must remain a Great Power. She\r\nhad opposed revolutionary France; but with Imperial France she had no\r\nlasting quarrel. Rather did her manifest destiny clash with that of\r\nRussia on the lower Danube, where the approaching break-up of the\r\nOttoman Power must bring those States into conflict. It was good\r\npolicy, then, to give a decided but friendly turn of Hapsburg policy\r\ntowards the east. Let Napoleon frankly approach the Emperor Francis\r\nand say in effect: \"I never sought this war with you, but I have\r\nconquered: I wish to restore complete harmony between us: and, in\r\norder to remove all causes of dispute, you must give up your Swabian,\r\nTyrolese, and Venetian lands: of these Tyrol shall fall to a prince of\r\nyour choice, and Venice (along with Trieste and Istria) shall form an\r\naristocratic Republic under a magistrate nominated in the first\r\ninstance by me. As a set-off to these losses, you shall receive\r\nMoldavia, Wallachia, and northern Bulgaria. If the Russians object to\r\nthis and attack you, I will be your ally.\" Such was Talleyrand's\r\nproposal.[51]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to criticise it in many details; but there can be little\r\ndoubt that its adoption by Napoleon would have laid a firmer\r\nfoundation for French supremacy than was afforded by the Treaties of\r\nPressburg and Tilsit. Austria would not have been deeply wounded, as\r\nshe now was by the transfer of her faithful Tyrolese to the detested\r\nrule of Bavaria, and by the undisguised triumph of Napoleon in Italy\r\nand along the Adriatic. Moreover, the erection of Tyrol and Venetia\r\ninto separate States would have been a wise concession to those\r\nclannish societies; and Austria could not have taken up the\r\nchampionship of outraged Tyrolese sentiment, which she assumed four\r\nyears later. Instead of figuring as the leader of German nationality,\r\nshe would have been on the worst of terms with the Czar over the\r\nEastern Question; and their discord would have enabled France to\r\ndictate her own terms as to the partition of the Sultan's dominions.\r\nTalleyrand had no specific for dissolving the traditional friendship\r\nof England and Austria, and we may imagine the joy with which he heard\r\nfrom the Hapsburg envoys the demand for Hanover, at a time when\r\nEnglish gold was pouring into the empty coffers at Vienna. Here was\r\nthe sure means of embroiling England and Austria for a generation at\r\nleast. But this further chance of preventing future coalitions was\r\nlikewise rejected by Napoleon, who deliberately chose to make Austria\r\na deadly foe, and to aggrandize her rival Prussia.[52]\r\n\r\nWhy did Napoleon reject Talleyrand's plan? Unquestionably, I think,\r\nbecause he had resolved to build up a Continental System, which should\r\n\"hermetically seal\" the coasts of Europe against English commerce. If\r\nhe was to realize those golden visions of his youth, ships, colonies,\r\nand an Eastern empire, which, even amidst the glories of Austerlitz,\r\nhe placed far above any European triumph, he must extend his coast\r\nsystem and subject or conciliate the maritime States. Of these the\r\nmost important were Prussia and Russia. The seaborne commerce of\r\nAustria was insignificant, and could easily be controlled from his\r\nvassal lands of Venetia and Dalmatia. To the would-be conqueror of\r\nEngland the friendship or hatred of Austria seemed unimportant: he\r\npreferred to depress this now almost land-locked Power, and to draw\r\ntight the bonds of union with Prussia, always provided that she\r\nexcluded British goods.[53]\r\n\r\nThe same reason led him to hope for a Russian alliance. Only by the\r\nhelp of Russia and Prussia could he shut England out from the Baltic;\r\nand, to win that help, he destined Hanover for Prussia and the\r\nDanubian States for the Czar. For the founder of the Continental\r\nSystem such a choice was natural; but, viewed from the standpoint of\r\nContinental politics, his treatment of Austria was a serious blunder.\r\nHis frightful pressure on her motley lands endowed them with a\r\nsolidity which they had never known before; and in less than four\r\nyears, the conqueror had cause to regret having driven the Hapsburgs\r\nto desperation. It may even be questioned whether Austerlitz itself\r\nwas not a misfortune to him. Just before that battle he thought of\r\ntreating Austria leniently, taking only Verona and Legnago, and\r\nexchanging Venetia against Salzburg. This would have detached her from\r\nthe Coalition, and made a friend of a Power that is naturally inclined\r\nto be conservative.\r\n\r\nAfter Austerlitz, he rushed to the other extreme and forced the\r\nHapsburgs to a hostility in which the Marie Louise marriage was only a\r\nforced and uneasy truce. His motives are not, in my judgment, to be\r\nassigned to mere lust of domination, but rather to a reasoned though\r\nexaggerated conviction of the need of Prussia and Russia to his\r\nContinental System. Above all things, he now sought to humble England,\r\nso that finally he might be free for his long-deferred Oriental\r\nenterprise. This is the irony of his career, that, though he preferred\r\nthe career of Alexander the Great to that of Cæsar; though he placed\r\nhis victory at Austerlitz far below the triumph of the great\r\nMacedonian at Issus which assured the conquest of the Orient, yet he\r\nfelt himself driven to the very measures which tethered him to _cette\r\nvieille Europe_ and which finally roused the Continent against him.\r\n\r\nAmong his errors of judgment, assuredly his behaviour to Austria in\r\n1805 was not the least. The recent history of Europe supplies a\r\nsuggestive contrast. Two generations after Austerlitz, the Hapsburg\r\nPower was shattered by the disaster of Königgrätz, and once more lost\r\nall influence in Germany and Italy. But the victor then showed\r\nconsideration for the vanquished. Bismarck had pondered over the\r\nlessons of history, because, as he said, _history teaches one how far\r\none may safely go_. He therefore persuaded King William to forego\r\nclaims that would have embittered the rivalry of Prussia and Austria.\r\nNay! he recurred to Talleyrand's policy of encouraging the Hapsburgs\r\nto seek in the Balkan Peninsula compensation for their losses in the\r\nwest: and within fifteen years the basis of the Triple Alliance was\r\nfirmly laid. Napoleon, on the other hand, for lack of that\r\nstatesmanlike moderation which consecrates victory and cements the\r\nfabric of an enduring Empire, soon saw the political results of\r\nAusterlitz swept away by the rising tide of the nations' wrath. In\r\nless than nine years the Austrians and their allies were masters of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n    NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION.--The account given on p. 41 of the\r\n    drowning of numbers of Russians at the close of the Battle of\r\n    Austerlitz was founded upon the testimony of Napoleon and many\r\n    French generals; the facts, as related by Lejeune, seemed quite\r\n    convincing; the Czar Alexander also asserted at Vienna in 1815\r\n    that 20,000 Russians had been drowned there. But the local\r\n    evidence (kindly furnished to me by Professor Fournier of Vienna)\r\n    seems to prove that the story is a myth. Both lakes were drained\r\n    only a few days after the battle, _at Napoleon's orders_; in the\r\n    lower lake not a single corpse was found; in the upper lake 150\r\n    corpses of horses, but only two, some say three, of men, were\r\n    found. Probably Napoleon invented the catastrophe for the sake of\r\n    dramatic effect, and others followed the lead given in his\r\n    bulletin. The Czar may have adopted the story because it helped to\r\n    excuse his defeat. (See my article in the \"Eng. Hist. Rev.\" for\r\n    July, 1902.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nPRUSSIA AND THE NEW CHARLEMAGNE\r\n\r\n\r\nAn eminent German historian, who has striven to say some kind words\r\nabout Frederick William's Government before the collapse at Jena,\r\nprefaces his apology by the axiom that from a Prussian monarch one\r\nought to expect, not French, English, or Russian policy, but only\r\nPrussian policy. The claim may well be challenged. Doubtless, there\r\nare some States concerning which it would be true. Countries such as\r\nGreat Britain and Spain, whose areas are clearly defined by nature,\r\nmay with advantage be self-contained until their peoples overflow into\r\nnew lands: before they become world Powers, they may gain in strength\r\nby being narrowly national. But there are other States whose fortunes\r\nare widely different. They represent some principle of life or energy,\r\nin the midst of mere political wreckage. If the binding power, which\r\nbuilt up an older organism, should decline, as happened to the Holy\r\nRoman Empire after the religious wars, fragments will fall away and\r\njoin bodies to which they are now more akin.\r\n\r\nOf the States that throve among the crumbling masses of the old Empire\r\nthe chief was Brandenburg-Prussia. She had a twofold energy which the\r\nolder organism lacked: she was Protestant and she was national; she\r\nchampioned the new creed cherished by the North Germans, and she felt,\r\nthough dimly as yet, the strength that came from an almost single kin.\r\nUntil she seized on part of the spoils of Poland, her Slavonic\r\nsubjects were for the most part germanized Slavs; and even after\r\nacquiring Posen and Warsaw at the close of the eighteenth century, she\r\ncould still claim to be the chief Germanic State. A generation\r\nearlier, Frederick the Great had seen this to be the source of her\r\nstrength. His policy was not merely Prussian: in effect, if not in\r\naim, it was German. His victory at Rossbach over a great polyglot\r\nforce of French and Imperialists first awakened German nationality to\r\na thrill of conscious life; and the last success of his career was the\r\nchampionship of the lesser German princes against the encroachments of\r\nthe Hapsburgs. In fact, it seems now a mere commonplace to assert that\r\nPrussia has prospered most when, as under Frederick the Great and\r\nWilliam the Great, her policy has been truly German, and that she has\r\nfallen back most in the years 1795-1806 and 1848-1852, when the\r\nsubservience of her Frederick Williams to France and Austria has lost\r\nthem the respect and support of the rest of the Fatherland. A State\r\nthat would attract other fragments of the same nation must be\r\nattractive, and it must be broadly national if it is to attract. If\r\nStein and Bismarck had been merely Prussians, if Cavour's policy had\r\nbeen narrowly Sardinian, would their States ever have served as the\r\nrallying centres for the Germany and Italy of to-day?\r\n\r\nThe difficulties which beset Frederick William III. in 1805 were not\r\nentirely of his own making. His predecessor of the same ill-omened\r\nname, when nearing the close of his inglorious reign, made the Peace\r\nof Basel (1795), which began to place the policy of Berlin at the beck\r\nand call of the French revolutionists. But the present ruler had\r\nassured Prussia's subservience to France at the time of the\r\nSecularizations, when he gained Erfurt, Eichsfeld, Hildesheim,\r\nPaderborn, and a great part of the straggling bishopric of Münster.\r\nEven at that time of shameless rapacity, there were those who saw that\r\nthe gain of half a million of subjects to Prussia was a poor return\r\nfor the loss of self-respect that befell all who shared in the\r\nsacrilegious plunder bartered away by Bonaparte and Talleyrand.\r\nFrederick William III. was even suspected of a leaning towards French\r\nmethods of Government; and a Prussian statesman said to the French\r\nambassador:\r\n\r\n    \"You have only the nobles against you: the King and the people are\r\n    openly for France. The revolution which you have made from below\r\n    upwards will be slowly effected in Prussia from above downwards:\r\n    the King is a democrat after his fashion: he is always striving to\r\n    curtail the privileges of the nobles, but by slow means. In a few\r\n    years feudal rights will cease to exist in Prussia.\"[54]\r\n\r\nCould the King have carried out these much-needed reforms, he might\r\nperhaps have opposed a solid society to the renewed might of France.\r\nBut he failed to set his house in order before the storm burst; and in\r\n1803 he so far gave up his championship of North German affairs as to\r\nallow the French to occupy Hanover, a land that he and his Ministers\r\nhad long coveted.\r\n\r\nWe saw in the last chapter that Hanover was the bait whereby Napoleon\r\nhooked the Prussian envoy, Haugwitz, at Schönbrunn; and that the very\r\nman who had been sent to impose Prussia's will upon the French Emperor\r\nreturned to Berlin bringing peace and dishonour. The surprise and\r\nannoyance of Frederick William may be imagined. On all sides\r\ndifficulties were thickening around him. Shortly before the return of\r\nHaugwitz to Berlin, the Russian troops campaigning in Hanover had been\r\nplaced under the protection of Prussia; and the King himself had\r\noffered to our Minister, Lord Harrowby, to protect Cathcart's\r\nAnglo-Hanoverian corps which, _with the aid of Prussian troops_, was\r\nrestoring the authority of George III. in that Electorate.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Frederick William could not complain of any shabby treatment\r\nfrom our Government. Knowing that he was set on the acquisition of\r\nHanover and could only be drawn into the Coalition by an equally\r\nattractive offer, the Pitt Ministry had proposed through Lord Harrowby\r\nthe cession to Prussia at the general peace of the lands south-west of\r\nthe Duchy of Cleves, \"bounded by a frontier line drawn from Antwerp to\r\nLuxemburg,\" and connected with the rest of her territories.[55] This\r\nplan, which would have planted Prussia firmly at Antwerp, Liège,\r\nLuxemburg, and Cologne, also aimed at installing the Elector of\r\nSalzburg in the rest of the new Rhenish acquisitions of France; while\r\nthe equipoise of the Powers was to be adjusted by the cession of\r\nSalzburg, the Papal Legations, and the line of the Mincio to Austria,\r\nshe in her turn giving up part of her Dalmatian lands to Russia.\r\nPrussia was to be the protectress of North Germany and regard any\r\nincursion of the French, \"north of the Maine or at least of the Lahn,\"\r\nas an act of war. Great Britain, after subsidizing Prussia for 100,000\r\ntroops on the usual scale, pledged herself to restore all her\r\nconquests made, or to be made, during the war, with the exception of\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope: but no questions were to be raised about that\r\ndesirable colony, or Malta, or the British maritime code.[56]\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1805, then, Frederick William was face to face with\r\nthe offers of England and those brought by Haugwitz from Napoleon.\r\nThat is, he had to choose between the half of Belgium and the\r\nRhineland as offered by England, or Hanover as a gift from Napoleon.\r\nThe former gain was the richer, but apparently the more risky, for it\r\nentailed the hatred of France: the latter seemed to secure the\r\nfriendship of the conqueror, though at the expense of the claims of\r\nhonour and a naval war with England. His confidential advisers,\r\nLombard, Beyme, and Haugwitz, were determined to gain the Electorate,\r\npreferably at Napoleon's hands; while his Foreign Minister,\r\nHardenberg, a Hanoverian by birth, desired to assure the union of his\r\nnative land with Prussia by more honourable means, and probably by\r\nmeans of an exchange with George III., which will be noticed\r\npresently. In his opposition to French influence, Hardenberg had the\r\nsupport of the more patriotic Prussians, who sought to safeguard\r\nPrussia's honour, and to avert war with England. The difficulty in\r\naccepting the Electorate at the point of Napoleon's sword was not\r\nmerely on the score of morality: it was due to the presence of a large\r\nforce of English, Hanoverians, and Russians on the banks of the Weser,\r\nand to the protection which the Prussian Government had offered to\r\nthose troops against any French attack, always provided that they did\r\nnot move against Holland and retired behind the Prussian\r\nbattalions.[57] The indignation of British officers at this last order\r\nis expressed by Christian Ompteda, of the King's German Legion, in a\r\nletter to his brother at Berlin: \"My dear fellow, if this sort of\r\nthing goes on, the Continent will soon be irrecoverably lost. The\r\nRussian and English armies will not long creep for refuge under the\r\ncontemptible Prussian cloak. We are here, 40,000 of the best and\r\nbravest troops. A swift move on Holland only would have opened the\r\nroad to certain success.... And this is Lombard's and Haugwitz's\r\nwork!\"[58]\r\n\r\nWhat meanwhile were George III.'s Ministers doing? At this crisis\r\nEnglish policy suffered a terrible blow. Death struck down the\r\n\"stately column\" that held up the swaying fortunes of our race.\r\nWilliam Pitt, long failing in health, was sore-stricken by the news of\r\nAusterlitz and the defection of Austria. But the popular version as to\r\nthe cause of his death--that _Austerlitz killed Pitt_--is more\r\nmelodramatic than correct. Among the many causes that broke that\r\nunbending spirit, the news of the miserable result of the Hanoverian\r\nExpedition was the last and severest. The files of our Foreign Office\r\npapers yield touching proof of the hopes which the Cabinet cherished,\r\neven after Vienna was in Napoleon's hands. Harrowby was urged to do\r\neverything in his power--short of conceding Hanover--to bring Prussia\r\ninto the field, in which case \"nearly 300,000 men will be available in\r\nNorth Germany at the beginning of the next campaign, which will\r\ninclude 70,000 British and Hanoverian troops employed there or in\r\nmaritime enterprises.\"[59] To this hope Pitt clung, even after hearing\r\nthe news of Austerlitz, and it was doubtless this which enabled him to\r\nbear that last journey from Bath to Putney Heath, with less fatigue\r\nand far more quickly than had been expected. He arrived home on\r\nSaturday night, January 11th. On the following Wednesday his friend,\r\nGeorge Rose, called on him and found that a serious change for the\r\nworse had set in.\r\n\r\n    \"On the Sunday he was better, and continued improving till Monday\r\n    in the afternoon, when Lord Castlereagh insisted on seeing him,\r\n    and, having obtained access to him, entered (Lord Hawkesbury being\r\n    also present) on points of public business of the most serious\r\n    importance (principally respecting the bringing home the British\r\n    troops from the Continent), which affected him visibly that\r\n    evening and the next day, and this morning the effect was more\r\n    plainly observed: ... his countenance is extremely changed, his\r\n    voice weak, and his body almost wasted.\"\r\n\r\nIt is clear also from the medical evidence which the diarist gives\r\nthat the news from Hanover was the cause of this sudden change. On the\r\nprevious Sunday, that is, just after the fatigue of the three days'\r\njourney, the physicians \"thought there was a reasonable prospect of\r\nMr. Pitt's recovery, that the probability was in favour of it, and\r\nthat, if his complaint should not take an unfavourable turn, he might\r\nbe able to attend to business in about a month.\"[60] That unfavourable\r\nturn took place when the heroic spirit lost all hope under the\r\ndistressing news from Berlin and Hanover. Austerlitz, it is true, had\r\ndepressed him. Yet that, after all, did not concern British honour and\r\nthe dearest interests of his master.\r\n\r\nBut, that Frederick William, from whom he had hoped so much, to whom\r\nhe was on the point of advancing a great subsidy, should now fall\r\naway, should talk of peace with Napoleon and claim Hanover, should\r\nforbid an invasion of Holland and request the British forces to\r\nevacuate North Germany--this was a blow to George III., to our\r\nmilitary prestige, and to the now tottering Ministry. How could he\r\nface the Opposition, already wellnigh triumphant in the sad Melville\r\nbusiness, with a King's Speech in which this was the chief news?\r\nLosing hope, he lost all hold on life: he sank rapidly: in the last\r\nhours his thoughts wandered away to Berlin and Lord Harrowby. \"What is\r\nthe wind?\" he asked. \"East; that will do; that will bring him fast,\"\r\nhe murmured. And, on January 23rd, about half an hour before he\r\nbreathed his last, the servant heard him say: \"My country: oh my\r\ncountry.\"[61]\r\n\r\nThus sank to rest, amidst a horror of great darkness, the statesman\r\nwhose noon had been calm and glorious. Only a superficial reading of\r\nhis career can represent him as eager for war and a foe to popular\r\nprogress. His best friends knew full well his pride in the great\r\nfinancial achievements of 1784-6, his resolute clinging to peace in\r\n1792, and his longing for a pacification in 1796, 1797, and 1800,\r\nprovided it could be gained without detriment to our allies and to the\r\nvital interests of Britain. His defence lies buried amidst the\r\ndocuments of our Record Office, and has not yet fully seen the light.\r\nFor he was a reserved man, the warmth of whose nature blossomed forth\r\nonly to a few friends, or on such occasions as his inspired speech on\r\nthe emancipation of slaves. To outsiders he had more than the usual\r\nfund of English coldness: he wrote no memoirs, he left few letters, he\r\nhad scant means of influencing public opinion; and he viewed with\r\nlofty disdain the French clamour that it was he who made and kept up\r\nthe war. \"I know it,\" he said; \"the Jacobins cry louder than we can,\r\nand make themselves heard.\"[62] He was, in fact, a typical champion of\r\nour rather dumb and stolid race, that plods along to the end of the\r\nappointed stage, scarcely heeding the cloud of stinging flies. Both\r\nthe people and its champion were ill fitted to cope with Napoleon.\r\nNone of our statesmen had the Latin tact and the histrionic gifts\r\nneedful to fathom his guile, to arouse the public opinion of Europe\r\nagainst him, or to expose his double-dealing.\r\n\r\nBut Pitt was unfortunate above all of them. It was his fate to begin\r\nhis career in an age of mediocrities and to finish it in an almost\r\nsingle combat with the giant. He was no match for Napoleon. The\r\nCoalition, which the Czar and he did so much to form, was a house of\r\ncards that fell at the conqueror's first touch; and the Prussian\r\nalliance now proved to be a broken reed. His notions of strategy were\r\npuerile. The French Emperor was not to be beaten by small forces\r\ntapping at his outworks; and Austria might reasonably complain that\r\nour neglect to attack the rear of the Grand Army in Flanders exposed\r\nher to the full force of its onset on the Danube. But though his\r\ngenius pales before the fiery comet of Napoleon, it shines with a\r\nclear and steady radiance when viewed beside that of the Continental\r\nstatesmen of his age. They flickered for a brief space and set. His\r\nwas the rare virtue of dauntless courage and unswerving constancy. By\r\nthe side of their wavering groups he stands forth like an Abdiel:\r\n\r\n  \"Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified,\r\n  His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal:\r\n  Nor number nor example with him wrought\r\n  To swerve from truth or change his constant mind,\r\n  Though single.\"\r\n\r\nWhile English statesmanship was essaying the task of forming a\r\nCoalition Ministry under Fox and Grenville, Napoleon with untiring\r\nactivity was consolidating his position in Germany, Italy, and France.\r\nIn Germany he allied his family by marriage with the now royal Houses\r\nof Bavaria and Würtemberg. He chased the Bourbons of Naples from their\r\nContinental domains. In France he found means to mitigate a severe\r\nfinancial crisis, and to strengthen his throne by a new order of\r\nhereditary nobility. In a word, he became the new Charlemagne.\r\n\r\nThe exaltation of the South German dynasties had long been a favourite\r\nproject with Napoleon, who saw in the hatred of the House of Bavaria\r\nfor Austria a sure basis for spreading French influence into the heart\r\nof Germany. Not long after the battle of Austerlitz, the Elector of\r\nBavaria, while out shooting, received from a French courier a letter\r\ndirected to \"Sa Majesté _le Roi_ de Bavière et de Suabe.\"[63] This\r\nletter was despatched six days after a formal request was sent through\r\nDuroc, that the Elector would give his daughter Augusta in marriage to\r\nEugène Beauharnais. The affair had been mooted in October: it was\r\nclinched by the victory of Austerlitz; and after Napoleon's arrival at\r\nMunich on the last day of the year, the final details were arranged.\r\nThe bridegroom was informed of it in the following laconic style: \"I\r\nhave arrived at Munich. I have arranged your marriage with the\r\nPrincess Augusta. It has been announced. This morning the princess\r\nvisited me, and I spoke with her for a long time. She is very pretty.\r\nYou will find herewith her portrait on a cup; but she is much better\r\nlooking.\" The wedding took place at Munich as soon as the bridegroom\r\ncould cross the Alps; and Napoleon delayed his departure for France in\r\norder to witness the ceremony which linked him with an old reigning\r\nfamily. At the same time he arranged a match between Jerome Bonaparte\r\nand Princess Catherine of Würtemberg. This was less expeditious,\r\npartly because, in the case of a Bonaparte, Napoleon judged it needful\r\nto sound the measure of his obedience. But Jerome had been broken in:\r\nhe had thrown over Miss Paterson, and, after a delay of a year and a\r\nhalf, obeyed his brother's behests, and strengthened the ties\r\nconnecting Swabia with France. A third alliance was cemented by the\r\nmarriage of the heir to the Grand Duchy of Baden with Stéphanie de\r\nBeauharnais, niece of Josephine.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1806 Napoleon might flatter himself with his\r\nbrilliant success as a match-maker. Yet, after all, he was less\r\nconcerned with the affairs of Hymen than with those of Mars and\r\nMercury. He longed to be at Paris for the settlement of finances; and\r\nhe burned to hear of the expulsion of the Bourbons from Naples. For\r\nthis last he had already sent forth his imperious mandates from\r\nVienna; and, after a brief sojourn at the Swabian capitals, he set out\r\nfor Paris, where he arrived incognito at midnight of January 26th.\r\nDuring his absence of one hundred and twenty-five days he had captured\r\nor destroyed two armies, stricken a mighty coalition to the heart,\r\nshattered the Hapsburg Power, and revolutionized the Germanic system\r\nby establishing two Napoleonic kingdoms in its midst.\r\n\r\nYet, as if nothing had been done, and all his hopes and thoughts lay\r\nin the future, he summoned his financial advisers to a council for\r\neight o'clock in the morning. Scarcely did he deign to notice their\r\ncongratulations on his triumphs. \"We have,\" he said, \"to deal with\r\nmore serious questions: it seems that the greatest dangers of the\r\nState were not in Austria: let us hear the report of the Minister of\r\nthe Treasury.\" It then appeared that Barbé-Marbois had been concerned\r\nin risky financial concerns with the Court of Spain, through a man\r\nnamed Ouvrard. The Minister therefore was promptly dismissed, and\r\nMollien then and there received his post. The new Minister states in\r\nhis memoirs that the money, which had sufficed to carry the French\r\narmies from the English Channel to the Rhine, had been raised on\r\nextravagant terms, largely on loans on the national domains. In fact,\r\nit had been an open question whether victory would come promptly\r\nenough to avert a wholesale crash at Paris.\r\n\r\nSo bad were the finances that, though 40,000,000 francs were poured\r\nevery year into France as subsidies from Italy and Spain, yet loans of\r\n120,000,000 francs had been incurred in order to meet current\r\nexpenses.[64] It would exceed the limits of our space to describe by\r\nwhat forceful means Napoleon restored the financial equilibrium and\r\nassuaged the commercial crisis resulting from the war with England.\r\nMollien soon had reason to know that, so far from avoiding Continental\r\nwars, the Emperor thenceforth seemed almost to provoke them, and that\r\nthe motto--_War must support war_--fell far short of the truth.\r\nNapoleon's wars, always excepting his war with England, supported the\r\nburdens of an armed peace. In this respect his easy and gainful\r\ntriumph over Austria was a disaster for France and Europe. It beckoned\r\nhim on to Jena and Tilsit.\r\n\r\nWhile reducing his finances to order and newspaper editors to\r\nservility, the conqueror received news of the triumph of his arms in\r\nSouthern Italy. There the Bourbons of Naples had mortally offended\r\nhim. After concluding a convention for the peaceable withdrawal of St.\r\nCyr's corps and the strict observance of neutrality by the kingdom of\r\nNaples, Ferdinand IV. and his Queen Caroline welcomed the arrival at\r\ntheir capital of an Anglo-Russian force of 20,000 men, and intrusted\r\nthe command of these and of the Neapolitan troops to General Lacy.[65]\r\nThis force, it is true, did little except weaken the northward march\r\nof Masséna; but the violation of neutrality by the Bourbons galled\r\nNapoleon. At Vienna he refused to listen to the timid pleading of the\r\nHapsburgs on their behalf, and as soon as peace was signed at\r\nPressburg he put forth a bulletin stating that St. Cyr was marching on\r\nNaples to hurl from the throne that guilty woman who had so flagrantly\r\nviolated all that is sacred among men. France would fight for thirty\r\nyears rather than pardon her atrocious act of perfidy: the Queen of\r\nNaples had ceased to reign: let her go to London and form a committee\r\nof sympathetic ink with Drake, Spencer-Smith, Taylor, and Wickham.\r\n\r\nThis diatribe was not the first occasion on which the conqueror had\r\nproved that he was no gentleman. In his brutal letter of January 2nd,\r\n1805, to Queen Caroline, he told her that, if she was the cause of\r\nanother war, she and her children would beg their bread all through\r\nEurope. That and similar outbursts afford some excuse for the conduct\r\nof the Bourbons in the autumn of 1805. They infringed the neutrality\r\nwhich their ambassador had engaged to observe: but it is to be\r\nremembered that Napoleon's invasion of the Neapolitan States in 1803\r\nwas a gross violation of international law, which the French Foreign\r\nOffice sought to cloak by fabricating two secret articles of the\r\nTreaty of Amiens.[66] And though troth should doubtless be kept, even\r\nwith a law-breaker, yet its violation becomes venial when the latter\r\nadopts the tone of a bully. For the present he triumphed. Joseph\r\nBonaparte invaded Naples in force, and on January 13th the King,\r\nQueen, and Court set sail for Palermo. The Anglo-Russian divisions\r\nre-embarked and sailed away for Malta and Corfu. One of the Neapolitan\r\nstrongholds, Gaëta, held out till the middle of July. Elsewhere the\r\nBourbon troops gave little trouble.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Naples enabled Napoleon to extend his experiment of a\r\nfederation of Bonapartist Kings. He announced to Miot de Melito, now\r\nappointed one of Joseph's administrators, his intentions in an\r\ninterview at the Tuileries on January 28th. Joseph was to be King of\r\nNaples, if he accepted the honour quickly. If not, the Emperor would\r\nadopt a son, as in the case of Eugène, and make him King.--\"I don't\r\nneed a wife to have an heir. It is by my pen that I get\r\nchildren.\"--But Joseph must also show himself worthy of the honour.\r\nLet him despise fatigue, get wounded, break a leg.\r\n\r\n    \"Look at me. The recent campaign, agitation, and movement have\r\n    made me fat. I believe that if all the kings coalesced against me,\r\n    I should get a quite ridiculous stomach.... You have heard my\r\n    words. I can no longer have relatives in obscurity. Those who will\r\n    not rise with me, shall no longer be of my family. I am making a\r\n    family of kings attached to my federative system.\"[67]\r\n\r\nThe threat having had its effect, Joseph was proclaimed King of Naples\r\nby a decree of Napoleon. \"Keep a firm hand: I only ask one thing of\r\nyou: be entirely the master there.\"[68] Such was the advice given to\r\nhis amiable brother, who after enjoying a military promenade\r\nsouthwards was charged to undertake the conquest of Sicily. It\r\nmattered little that the overthrow of the Neapolitan Bourbons offended\r\nthe Czar, who had undertaken the protection of that House.\r\n\r\nAs though intent on browbeating Alexander by an exhibition of his\r\npower, Napoleon lavished Italian titles on his Marshals and statesmen.\r\nTalleyrand became Prince of Benevento; and Bernadotte, Prince of\r\nPonte-Corvo (two Papal enclaves in Neapolitan soil). To these and\r\nother titles were attached large domains (not divisible at death),\r\nwhich enabled his paladins and their successors to support their new\r\ndignities with pomp and splendour; especially was this so with the two\r\ntitles which his bargains with Prussia and Bavaria enabled him to\r\nbestow. Thanks to the complaisance of their Kings, the Grand Duchy of\r\nBerg and Cleves was granted to Murat, while the energetic and trusty\r\nBerthier was rewarded with the Principality of Neufchâtel and a truly\r\nprincely fortune.[69]\r\n\r\nThus was founded the Napoleonic nobility; and thus was fulfilled Mme.\r\nde Staël's prophecy that the priests and nobles would be the\r\n_caryatides_ of the future throne. The change was brought about\r\nskilfully. It took place when pride in Napoleon's exploits was at its\r\nheight, and when the \"Gazette de France\" asserted:\r\n\r\n    \"France is henceforth the arbitress of Europe.... Civilization\r\n    would have perished in Europe, if forth from the ruins there had\r\n    not arisen one of these men before whom the world keeps silence,\r\n    and to whom Providence seems to intrust its destinies.\"[70]\r\n\r\nThis adulation, which recalls that of the Court of Augustus or\r\nTiberius, gives the measure of French thought. In truth, Napoleon\r\nshowed profound insight into human nature when he judged the hatred of\r\nan order of nobility to be a mere passing spasm of revolutionary\r\nfever; and he evinced equal good sense in restoring that order through\r\nthe chiefs of the one truly popular institution in France, the army.\r\nBesides, the new titles were not taken from French domains, which\r\nwould have revived the idea of feudal dependence in France: they were\r\nthe fruit of Napoleon's great victory; and the sound of distant names\r\nlike Benevento, Berg, and Dalmatia skilfully flattered the pride of\r\n_la grande nation_.\r\n\r\nIt is now time to return to the affairs of Prussia and to point out\r\nthe chief stages in her downward course. On January 3rd, 1806, an\r\nimportant State Council was held at Berlin in order to decide on\r\ncertain modifications to the Schönbrunn Treaty with Napoleon. The\r\nchief change resolved on was as follows: Instead of the cessions of\r\nterritory being immediate and absolute, as proposed by Napoleon, they\r\nwere not to take effect before the general peace. Until that took\r\nplace, Frederick William resolved to occupy Hanover provisionally,\r\nmeanwhile answering to France for the tranquillity of the north of\r\nGermany.[71] The Prussian Government therefore gave strong hints that\r\nthe presence of a British force there was objectionable, and the\r\ntroops were withdrawn.[72]\r\n\r\nNapoleon was to be less pliable. And yet Haugwitz assured the Prussian\r\nKing and council that he had looked Napoleon through and through, and\r\nhad discerned an unexpressed wish to deal easily with Prussia. As to\r\nhis acceptance of these changes in the Schönbrunn Treaty, Haugwitz\r\nfelt no doubt whatever, at least so his foe, Hardenberg, states. But\r\nthe Prussian Ministers were now proposing, not the offensive and\r\ndefensive treaty of alliance that Napoleon required, but rather a\r\nmediation for peace between France and England. They were, in fact,\r\nstriving to steer halfway between Napoleon and George III.--and gain\r\nHanover. Verily, here was a belief in half measures passing that of\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nThe envoy despatched to assure Napoleon's assent to these new\r\nconditions was the very man who had quailed before the Emperor at\r\nSchönbrunn. Count Haugwitz set out on January 14th for Munich and\r\nthence for Paris; but long before any definite news was received from\r\nhim, the Court of Berlin decided, on the strength of a few oily\r\ncompliments from the French ambassador, Laforest, to regard the\r\nacceptance of Napoleon as fully assured. Accordingly, on January 24th,\r\nthe Government resolved to place the Prussian army on a peace-footing\r\nand recall the troops from Franconia, as a daily saving of 100,000\r\nthalers might thereby be effected. Never was there a greater act of\r\nextravagance. As soon as the retreat and demobilizing of the Prussian\r\nforces was announced, the French troops in Bavaria and Franconia began\r\nto press forward, while others poured across the Rhine. Affecting to\r\nignore these threatening moves, the Prussian Court strove peaceably to\r\nacquire Hanover by secretly offering George III. a re-arrangement of\r\nterritories, whereby the Hanoverian lands east of the Weser, along\r\nwith a few districts west of Hameln and Nienburg, should pass to\r\nPrussia. Frederick William proposed to keep Minden and Ravensburg, but\r\nto cede East Frisia and all the rest of his Westphalian possessions to\r\nKing George, who would retain the electoral dignity for these new\r\nlands.[73] The only reply that our ruler deigned to this offer was\r\nthat he trusted:\r\n\r\n    \"His Prussian Majesty will follow the honourable dictates of his\r\n    own heart, and will demonstrate to the world that he will not set\r\n    the dreadful example of indemnifying himself at the expense of a\r\n    third party, whose sentiments and conduct towards him and his\r\n    subjects have been uniformly friendly and pacifick.\"[74]\r\n\r\nBut by the close of February this appeal fell on deaf ears. Frederick\r\nWilliam had decided to comply with Napoleon's terms and was about to\r\ntake formal possession of Hanover.\r\n\r\nThe conqueror was far from taking that easy view of the changes made\r\nin the Schönbrunn Treaty which the discerning Haugwitz had trustfully\r\nexpected. At first, every effort was made by Talleyrand to delay his\r\ninterview with the Emperor, evidently in the hope that the subtle\r\nflattery of Laforest at Berlin would lead to the demobilization of the\r\nPrussian forces. This fatal step was known at Paris before February\r\n6th, when Haugwitz was received by the Emperor; and the knowledge that\r\nPrussia was at his mercy decided the conqueror's tone. He began by\r\nsome wheedling words as to the ability shown by Haugwitz in the\r\nSchönbrunn negotiation:\r\n\r\n    \"If anyone but myself had treated with you I should have thought\r\n    him bought over by you; but, let me confess to you, the treaty was\r\n    due to your talents and merit. You were in my eyes the first\r\n    statesman in Europe, and covered yourself with immortal glory.\"\r\n\r\nBefore that interview, forsooth, he had decided to make war on\r\nPrussia; and only Haugwitz had induced him to offer her peace and the\r\ngift of Hanover. Why, then, had that treaty been so criticised at\r\nBerlin? Why had the French ambassador been slighted? Why was\r\nHardenberg high in favour? Why had not the King dismissed that tool of\r\nEngland? Here the envoy strove to stem the rising torrent of the\r\nEmperor's wrath; his words were at once swept aside; and the deluge\r\nflowed on. As Prussia had not ratified the treaty pure and simple, she\r\nwas in a state of war with France; for she still had Russian and\r\nEnglish troops on her soil. Here again Haugwitz observed that those\r\nforces were withdrawing, and that the Prussians were entering Hanover\r\nin force. The storm burst forth anew. What right had Prussia thus to\r\ncarry into effect a treaty which she had not ratified? If her forces\r\nentered Hanover, his troops should forthwith occupy Ansbach, Cleves,\r\nand Neufchâtel: if Frederick William meant to have Hanover, he should\r\npay dearly for it. But he would allow Haugwitz to see Talleyrand, so\r\nas to prevent an immediate war.[75]\r\n\r\nThe calm of the Foreign Minister was as dangerous as the bluster of\r\nthe Emperor. Talleyrand was no friend to Prussia. He had long known\r\nNapoleon's determination to press on a war between England and\r\nPrussia, and he lent himself to the plan of undermining the\r\nHohenzollerns. The scales now fell from the envoy's eyes. He saw that\r\nhis country stood friendless before an exacting creditor, who now\r\nclaimed further sacrifices--or Prussia's life-blood. The Emperor's\r\nthreats were partly fictitious; and when Haugwitz was thoroughly\r\nfrightened and ready to concede almost anything, Napoleon came to the\r\nreal point at issue, and demanded that the whole of the German\r\ncoast-line on the North Sea should be closed to English commerce. With\r\nthis stringent clause superadded, Hanover was now handed over to\r\nPrussia. Never was a Greek gift more skilfully offered. The present of\r\nHanover on those terms implied for the recipient Russia's disapproval\r\nand the hostility of England.[76]\r\n\r\nThis was the news brought by Haugwitz to Berlin. Frederick William was\r\nnow on the horns of the very dilemma which he had sought to avoid.\r\nEither he must accept Napoleon's terms, or defy the conqueror to\r\nalmost single combat. The irony of his position was now painfully\r\napparent. In his longing for peace and retrenchment he had dismissed\r\nhis would-be allies, and had sent his own soldiers grumbling to their\r\nhomes. Moreover, he was tied by his previous action. If he accepted\r\npeace from Napoleon at Christmas, when 300,000 men could have disputed\r\nthe victor's laurels, how much more must he accept it now! He not only\r\ngave way on this point: he even complied with Napoleon's wishes by\r\nkeeping Hardenberg at a distance. He did not dismiss him--the\r\nfriendship of the spirited Queen Louisa forbade that: but Hardenberg\r\nyielded up to Haugwitz the guidance of foreign affairs, and was\r\ngranted unlimited leave of absence.\r\n\r\nPopular feeling was deeply moved by this craven compliance with French\r\nbehests. The officers of the Berlin garrison serenaded the patriotic\r\nstatesman, while Haugwitz twice had his windows smashed. Public\r\nopinion, it is true, counted for little in Prussia. The rigorous\r\nseparation of classes, the absence of popular education, the complete\r\nsubjection of the journals to Government, and the mutual jealousy of\r\nsoldiers and civilians, prevented any general expression of opinion in\r\nthat almost feudal society.\r\n\r\nBut when the people of Ansbach piteously begged not to be handed over\r\nto Bavaria, and forthwith saw their land occupied by the French before\r\nPrussia had ratified the cession of that principality; when the North\r\nGermans found that the gain of Hanover by Prussia was at the price of\r\nwar with England and the ruin of their commerce; when it was seen that\r\nFrederick William and Haugwitz had clipped the wings of the Prussian\r\neagle till it shunned a fight with the Gallic cock, a feeling of shame\r\nand indignation arose which proved that the limits of endurance had\r\nbeen reached. Observers saw that, after all, the old German feeling\r\nwas not dead; it was only torpid; and forces were beginning to work\r\nwhich threatened ruin to the Hohenzollerns if they again tarnished the\r\nnational honour.[77]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the first overtures for peace were exchanged between Paris,\r\nLondon, and St. Petersburg. In the spring of 1806 there seemed some\r\nground for hope that Europe might find repose, at least on land, after\r\nfourteen years of almost constant war. France was no longer\r\nJacobinical. Under Napoleon she had quickly fallen into line with the\r\nmonarchical States, and the questions now at stake merely related to\r\nboundaries and the balance of power. The bellicose ardour of the Czar\r\nhad melted away at Austerlitz. The seizure of Hanover by Prussia moved\r\nhim but little, and he sought to compose the resulting strife. As for\r\nthe other Powers, they were either helpless or torpid. The King of\r\nSweden was venting his spleen upon Prussia. Italy, South Germany,\r\nHolland, and Spain were at Napoleon's beck; and the policy of England\r\nunder the new Grenville-Fox Ministry inclined strongly towards peace.\r\nThere seemed, then, every chance of founding the supremacy of France\r\nupon lasting foundations, if the claims of Britain and Austria\r\nreceived reasonable satisfaction. Napoleon also seems to have wanted\r\npeace for the consolidation of his power in Europe and the extension\r\nof his colonies and commerce. As at the close of all his land\r\ncampaigns, his thoughts turned to the East, and on January 31st, 1806,\r\nhe issued orders to Decrès which, far from showing any despair as to\r\nthe French navy, foreshadowed a vigorous naval and colonial policy;\r\nwhile his moves on the Dalmatian coast, and the despatch of Sebastiani\r\non a mission to the Porte, revealed the magnetic attraction which the\r\nLevant still had for him.\r\n\r\nA peculiar interest therefore attaches to the negotiations for peace\r\nin 1806, especially as they were pushed on by that generous orator,\r\nFox, who had so long pleaded for a good understanding with France. On\r\nFebruary 20th, 1806, he disclosed to Talleyrand the details of a\r\nsupposed plot for the murder of the French Emperor, which some person\r\nhad proposed to him, an offer which he rejected with horror, at the\r\nsame time ordering the man to be expelled from the kingdom. It is more\r\nthan probable that the whole thing was got up by the French police as\r\na test of the esteem which Fox had always expressed for Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nThe experiment having turned out well, Talleyrand assured Fox of the\r\npacific desires of the French Emperor as recently stated to the Corps\r\nLégislatif, namely, that peace could be had on the terms of the Treaty\r\nof Amiens. Fox at once clasped the outstretched hand, but stated that\r\nthe negotiations must be in concert with Russia, and the treaty such\r\nas our allies could honourably accept. To this Talleyrand, on April\r\n1st, gave a partial assent, adding that Napoleon was convinced that\r\nthe rupture of the Peace of Amiens was due solely to the refusal of\r\nFrance to grant a treaty of commerce. France and England could now\r\ncome to satisfactory terms, if England would be content with the\r\nsovereignty of the seas, and not interfere with Continental\r\naffairs.[78] France desired, not a truce, but a durable peace.\r\n\r\nTo this Fox assented, but traversed the French claim that Russia's\r\nparticipation would imply her mediation. Peace could only come from an\r\nhonourable understanding between all the Powers actually at war.\r\nTalleyrand denied that Russia was at war with France, as the Third\r\nCoalition had lapsed; but Fox held his ground, and declared there must\r\nbe peace with England _and Russia_, or not at all: otherwise France\r\nwould be seen to aim at \"excluding us from any connection with the\r\nContinental Powers of Europe.\"[79]\r\n\r\nSuch a beginning was disappointing: it showed that Napoleon and\r\nTalleyrand were intent on sowing distrust between England and Russia,\r\nwho were mutually pledged not to make peace separately; and for a time\r\nall overtures ceased between London and Paris, until it was known that\r\na Russian envoy was going to Paris. Hitherto the French Foreign Office\r\nhad won brilliant successes by skilfully separating and embittering\r\nallies. But now it seemed that their tactics were foiled. Two firm and\r\ntrusty allies yet remained, Britain and Russia. To Czartoryski our\r\nForeign Minister had expressed his desire that the former offensive\r\nalliance should now take a solely defensive character: \"If we cannot\r\nreduce the enormous power of France, it will always be something to\r\nstop its progress.\" To these opinions the Russian Minister gave a\r\ncordial assent, and despatched a special envoy to London to concert\r\nterms of peace along with the British Ministry, while Oubril, \"a safe\r\nman on whose prudence and principles the two allied Courts may safely\r\nrely,\" was despatched to Vienna and Paris.[80]\r\n\r\nOubril proceeded to Vienna, where he had long discussions with the\r\nBritish and French ambassadors: Fox also requested that Lord Yarmouth,\r\none of the many hundreds of Englishmen still kept under restraint in\r\nFrance, might have his freedom and repair at once to Paris for a\r\npreliminary discussion with Talleyrand. The request being granted, the\r\nprisoner left the depot at Verdun, and, early in June, saw that\r\nMinister in his first flush of pride at the new title of Prince of\r\nBenevento. At that time Paris was intoxicated with Napoleon's glory.\r\nThe French were lords of Franconia, whence they levied heavy\r\nexactions: in Italy they defied the Pope's authority.[81] They were\r\nfirmly installed at Ancona, despite repeated protests of Pius VII.\r\nKing Joseph with an army of 45,000 men was planning the expulsion of\r\nthe Bourbons from Sicily. And in these early days of June, Louis\r\nBonaparte was declared King of Holland.\r\n\r\nYet Talleyrand was not so dazzled by this splendour as to slight the\r\nidea of peace with England; and when Lord Yarmouth stated that George\r\nIII. would above all things require the restoration of Hanover, the\r\nMinister, after a delay in which he consulted his master, stated that\r\nthat would make no difficulty. As to the other questions, namely,\r\nSicily and the maintenance of the Turkish Empire, he replied: \"You\r\nhold Sicily, we do not ask it of you: if we possessed it, it might\r\nmuch increase our difficulties\"; and as regards Turkey he advised\r\nthat England should speedily gain the guarantee of its integrity from\r\nFrance--\"for much is being prepared, but nothing is yet done.\" After\r\nreporting these views at Downing Street, Lord Yarmouth returned to\r\nParis for further discussions, with the general understanding that the\r\nprinciple of _uti possidetis_ should form their basis--except as\r\nregards Hanover. He now was informed by Talleyrand that the\r\nnegotiations with Russia were to be kept separate, and that Napoleon\r\nhad other views about Sicily, as he looked on its conquest as\r\nnecessary for Joseph's security on the mainland.\r\n\r\nSurprised at this change, our envoy stated that he could not discuss\r\nany terms of peace in which Sicily was not kept for the Bourbons;\r\nwhereupon Talleyrand replied that things were altered, and that we\r\nought to be content with regaining Hanover from Prussia and keeping\r\nMalta and the Cape of Good Hope. On Lord Yarmouth declining to proceed\r\nfurther until the French claims to Sicily were renounced, the offer of\r\nthe Hanse Towns (Lübeck, Hamburg, and Bremen) was made for his\r\nSicilian Majesty; and on the refusal of that bait, Dalmatia, Ragusa,\r\nand Albania were proposed.\r\n\r\nAs Napoleon had offered to guarantee the integrity of the Turkish\r\nEmpire, Lord Yarmouth showed some indignation at a proposal which\r\nwould have begun its partition; and, but for the expected arrival of\r\nOubril, would have broken off the negotiation. On July 8th he saw the\r\nRussian envoy and found him a man of straw. Oubril approved\r\neverything. He was glad that France would give back Hanover to\r\nEngland, because that would sever the Franco-Prussian union and make\r\nthe Court of Berlin dependent on Russia. He even thought it might be\r\nwell for the Hanse Towns to go to the Neapolitan Bourbons, provided\r\nthose towns were placed under the Czar's protection. But even better\r\nwas the proposal that those Bourbons should have Dalmatia and\r\nneighbouring lands; for that would drive a wedge between Napoleon and\r\nTurkey. Such was the gist of this curious interview. Desirous of\r\ntesting the accuracy of his account of it, Lord Yarmouth read it over\r\nto Oubril at their next interview, when the Russian envoy added the\r\nfollowing written corrections:\r\n\r\n    \"N.B.M. d'Oubril believes, though he has no directions on this\r\n    subject, that it would be suitable to Russia, and even\r\n    advantageous for the assuring their own independence, that Hamburg\r\n    and Lübeck should pass under the suzerainty of Russia.--N.B.\r\n    Although M. d'Oubril has a positive order to insist on the\r\n    preservation of Sicily for the King of Naples, yet he is of\r\n    opinion that the acquisition of Venetia, Istria, Dalmatia, and\r\n    Albania\" [should be an establishment for his Sicilian\r\n    Majesty].[82]\r\n\r\nThat a reed shaken by every breeze should bow before Napoleon's will\r\nwas not surprising; and late at night on July 20th Lord Yarmouth heard\r\nthat the Russian envoy had just signed a separate peace with France,\r\nwhereby the independence of the Ionian Isles was recognized (Russia\r\nkeeping only 4,000 troops in Corfu), and Germany was to be evacuated\r\nby the French. But the sting was in the tail: for a secret article\r\nstipulated that Ferdinand IV. should cede Sicily to Joseph Bonaparte\r\nand receive the Balearic Isles from Napoleon's ally, Spain.\r\n\r\nSuch was the news which our envoy heard, after forcing his way to\r\nOubril's presence, just as the latter was hurrying off to St.\r\nPetersburg. At that city an important change had taken place;\r\nCzartoryski had retired in favour of Baron Budberg, who was less\r\nfavourable to a close alliance with England; and it appears certain\r\nthat Oubril would not have broken through his instructions had he not\r\nknown of this change. What other motives led him to break faith with\r\nEngland, Sicily, and Spain are not clearly known. He claimed that the\r\nnew order of things in Germany rendered it highly important to get the\r\nFrench troops out of that land. Doubtless this was so; but even that\r\nbenefit would have been dearly bought at the price of disgrace to the\r\nCzar.[83]\r\n\r\nLeaving for the present Oubril to face his indignant master, we turn\r\nto notice an epoch-making change, the details of which were settled at\r\nParis in the midst of the negotiations with England and Russia. On\r\nJuly 17th was quietly signed the Act of the Confederation of the\r\nRhine, that destroyed the old Germanic Empire.\r\n\r\nSome such event had long been expected. The Holy Roman Empire, after a\r\nthousand years of life, had been stricken unto death at Austerlitz.\r\nThe seizure of Hanover by Prussia had led the King of Sweden to\r\ndeclare that he, for his Pomeranian lands, would take no more share in\r\nthe deliberations of the senile Diet at Ratisbon which took no notice\r\nof that outrage. Moreover, Ratisbon was now merely the second city of\r\nBavaria, whose King might easily deny to that body its local\r\nhabitation; and the use of the term Germanic Confederation in the\r\nTreaty of Pressburg sounded the death-knell of an Empire which\r\nVoltaire with equal wit and truth had described as neither holy, nor\r\nRoman, nor an Empire. In the new age of trenchant realities how could\r\nthat venerable figment survive--where the election of the Emperor was\r\na sham, his coronation a mere parade of tattered robes before a crowd\r\nof landless Serenities, and where the Diet was largely concerned with\r\nregulating the claims of the envoys of princes to sit on seats of red\r\ncloth or on the less honourable green cloth, or with apportioning the\r\ntraditional thirty-seven dishes of the imperial banquet so that the\r\nlast should be borne by a Westphalian envoy?[84]\r\n\r\nAmong these spectral survivals of an outworn life the incursion of\r\nNapoleon across the Rhine had aroused a panic not unlike that which\r\nthe sturdy form of Æneas cast on the gibbering shades of the Greeks in\r\nthe mourning fields of Hades. And when, on August 1st, 1806, the heir\r\nto the Revolution notified to the Diet at Ratisbon that neither he nor\r\nthe States of South and Central Germany any longer recognized the\r\nexistence of the old Empire, feebler protests arose than came from the\r\nstraining throats of the scared comrades of Agamemnon. The Diet itself\r\nuttered no audible sound. The Emperor, Francis II., forthwith declared\r\nthat he laid down his crown, absolved all the electors and princes\r\nfrom their allegiance, and retired within the bounds of the Austrian\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nThus feebly flickered out the light which had shed splendour on\r\nmediæval Christendom. Kindled in the basilica of St. Peter's on\r\nChristmas Day of the year 800 in an almost mystical union of spiritual\r\nand earthly power, by the blessing of Pope Leo on Karl the Great, it\r\nwas now trodden under foot by the chief of a more than Frankish State,\r\nwho aspired to unquestioned sway over a dominion as great as that of\r\nthe mediæval hero. For Napoleon, as Protector of the Rhenish\r\nConfederation, now controlled most of the German lands that\r\nacknowledged Charlemagne, while his hold on Italy was immeasurably\r\nstronger. Further parallels between two ages and systems so unlike as\r\nthose of Charlemagne and his imitator are of course superficial; and\r\nNapoleon's attempt at impressing the imagination of the Germans seems\r\nto us to smack of unreality. Yet we must remember that they were then\r\nthe most impressionable and docile of nations, that his attempt was\r\nmade with much skill, and that none of the appointed guardians of the\r\nold Empire raised a voice in protest while he imposed a constitution\r\non the fifteen Princes of the new Confederation.\r\n\r\nThey included the rulers of South Germany, as well as Dalberg the\r\nArch-Chancellor, who now took the title of Prince Primate, the\r\nGrand-Duke of Berg, the Landgrave, now Grand-Duke, of Hesse-Darmstadt,\r\ntwo Princes of the House of Nassau, and seven lesser potentates. In\r\nsome cases German laws were abolished in favour of the _Code\r\nNapoléon_. A close offensive and defensive alliance was framed between\r\nFrance and these States, that were to furnish in all 63,000 troops at\r\nthe bidding of the Protector. Napoleon also gained some control over\r\ntheir fiscal and commercial codes--an important advantage, in view of\r\nthe Continental System, that was soon to take definite form.[85]\r\n\r\nAs a set-off to this surrender of all questions of foreign policy and\r\nmany internal rights, what did these rulers receive? As happened\r\nalmost uniformly in Napoleon's aggrandizements, he struck a bargain\r\nextremely serviceable to himself, less so to those whose support he\r\nsought, and in which the losses fell crushingly on the weak. His\r\nstatecraft in this respect was more cynical than that of the crowned\r\nrobbers who had degraded eighteenth-century politics into a game of\r\ngrab. Their robberies were at least direct and straightforward. It was\r\nreserved for Napoleon at the Treaty of Campo Formio to win huge gains\r\nmostly at the expense of a weak third party, namely, Venice. He\r\npursued the same profitable tactics in the Secularizations, when\r\nFrance and the greater German Powers gained enormously at the final\r\ncost of the Church lands and the little States; and now he ground up\r\nthe German domains that were to cement his new Rhenish system.\r\n\r\nThere were still numbers of Imperial Counts and Knights, as well as\r\nfree cities, that had not been absorbed in 1803. The survivors were\r\nnow wiped out by Napoleon for the benefit of his Rhenish underlings,\r\nthe spoliation being veiled under the term _Mediatization_. The\r\neuphemism claims a brief explanation. In old German law the nobles and\r\ncities that gained local independence by shaking off the control of\r\nthe local potentate were termed _immediate_, because they owed\r\nallegiance directly to the Emperor, without any feudal intermediary:\r\nif by mischance they fell under that hated control they were said to\r\nbe _mediatized_. This term was now applied to acts that subjected the\r\nknight, or city, not to feudal control, but to complete absorption by\r\nthe king or prince of Napoleon's creation. Six Imperial or Free Cities\r\nsurvived the Secularizations, namely, the three Hanse towns, and\r\nAugsburg, Frankfurt, and Nuremberg. The northern towns still held\r\ntheir ancient rights; but Augsburg and Nuremberg now fell to the King\r\nof Bavaria, and Frankfurt was bestowed by Napoleon on Dalberg, the\r\nPrince Primate of the Confederation.\r\n\r\nGerman life began to lose much of the quaint diversity beloved of\r\nartists and poets; but it also gained much. No longer did the Count of\r\nLimburg-Styrum parade his army of one colonel, six officers, and two\r\nprivates in the valley of the Roehr: he and his passed under the sway\r\nof Murat, and the lapse of these pigmy forces made a national army\r\npossible in the dim future. No more did the Imperial lawyers at\r\nWetzlar browse on evergreen lawsuits: justice was administered after\r\nthe concise methods of Napoleon. The crops of the Swabian peasant were\r\nnow comparatively safe from the deer of His Translucency of the castle\r\nhard by; for the spirit of the French Revolution breathed upon the old\r\ngame laws and robbed them of their terrors. And the German patriot of\r\nto-day must still confess that the first impulse for reform, however\r\nquestionable its motives and brutal its application, came from the new\r\nCharlemagne.\r\n\r\n    NOTE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.--In a volume of Essays entitled\r\n    \"Napoleonic Studies\" (George Bell and Sons, 1904) I have treated\r\n    somewhat fully the questions of Pitt's Continental policy, and of\r\n    Napoleon's relations to the new thought of the age, in two Essays,\r\n    entitled \"Pitt's Plans for the Settlement of Europe\" and\r\n    \"Wordsworth, Schiller, Fichte, and the Idealist Revolt against\r\n    Napoleon.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF PRUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now turn to consider the influence which the founding of the\r\nRhenish Confederation exerted on the international problems which were\r\nbeing discussed at Paris. Having gained this diplomatic victory,\r\nNapoleon, it seems, might well afford to be lenient to Prussia, to the\r\nCzar, even to England. Would he seize this opportunity, and soothe the\r\nfears of these Powers by a few timely concessions, or would he press\r\nthem all the harder because the third of Germany was now under his\r\ncontrol? Here again he was at the parting of the ways.\r\n\r\nAs the only obstacles to the conclusion of a durable peace with\r\nEngland were Sicily and Hanover, it may be well to examine here the\r\nbearing of these questions on the peace of Europe and Napoleon's\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from his letters to Joseph that he had firmly resolved to\r\nconquer Sicily. Before his brother had reached Naples he warned him to\r\nprepare for the expulsion of the Bourbons from that island. For that\r\npurpose the French pushed on into Calabria and began to make extensive\r\npreparations--at the very time when Talleyrand stated to Lord Yarmouth\r\nthat the French did not want Sicily. But the English forces defending\r\nthat island prepared to deal a blow that would prevent a French\r\ndescent. A force of about 5,000 men under Sir John Stuart landed in\r\nthe Bay of St. Euphemia: and when, on the 4th of July, 1806, Reynier\r\nled 7,000 troops against them in full assurance of victory, his\r\nchoicest battalions sank before the fierce bayonet charge of the\r\nBritish: in half an hour the French were in full retreat, leaving half\r\ntheir numbers on the field.\r\n\r\nThe moral effect of this victory was very great. Hitherto our troops,\r\nexcept in Egypt, had had no opportunity of showing their splendid\r\nqualities. More than half a century had passed since at Minden a\r\nBritish force had triumphed over a French force in Europe; and\r\nNapoleon expressed the current opinion when he declared to Joseph his\r\njoy that at last the _slow and clumsy English_ had ventured on the\r\nmainland.[86] Moreover, the success at Maida, the general rising of\r\nthe Calabrias that speedily followed, and Stuart's capture of Reggio,\r\nCortone, and other towns, with large stores and forty cannon destined\r\nfor the conquest of Sicily, scattered to the winds the French hope of\r\ncarrying Sicily by a _coup de main_.\r\n\r\nIf there was any chance of the Russian and British Governments\r\ndeserting the cause of the Bourbons, it was ended by the news from the\r\nMediterranean; and Napoleon now realized that the mastery of that\r\nsea--\"_the principal and constant aim of my policy_\"--had once more\r\nslipped from his grasp! On their side the Bourbons were unduly elated\r\nby a further success which was more brilliant than solid. Queen\r\nCaroline, excited at the capture of Capri by Sir Sidney Smith, sought\r\nto rouse all her lost provinces: she intrigued behind the back of the\r\nKing and of General Acton, while the knight-errant succeeded in\r\nparalyzing the plans of Sir John Stuart.[87] Meanwhile Masséna, after\r\nreducing the fortress of Gaëta to surrender, marched southward with a\r\nlarge force, and the British and Bourbon forces re-embarked for\r\nSicily, leaving the fierce peasants and bandits of Calabria to the\r\nmercies of the conquerors. But Maida was not fought in vain. Sicily\r\nthenceforth was safe, the British army regained something of its\r\nancient fame, and the hope of resisting Napoleon was strengthened both\r\nat St. Petersburg and London.\r\n\r\nPeace can rarely be attained unless one of the combatants is overcome\r\nor both are exhausted. But neither Great Britain nor France was in\r\nthis position. By sea our successes had been as continuous as those of\r\nNapoleon over our allies on land. In January we captured the Cape from\r\nthe Dutch: in February the French force at St. Domingo surrendered to\r\nSir James Duckworth: Admiral Warren in March closed the career of the\r\nadventurous Linois; and early in July a British force seized great\r\ntreasure at Buenos Ayres, whence, however, it was soon obliged to\r\nretire. After these successes Fox could not but be firm. He refused to\r\nbudge from the standpoint of _uti possidetis_ which our envoy had\r\nstated as the basis of negotiations: and the Earl of Lauderdale, who\r\nwas sent to support and finally to supersede the Earl of Yarmouth, at\r\nonce took a firm tone which drew forth a truculent rejoinder. If that\r\nwas to be the basis, wrote Clarke, the French plenipotentiary, then\r\nFrance would require Moravia, Styria, the whole of Austria (Proper),\r\nand Hanover, and in that case leave England her few colonial\r\nconquests.\r\n\r\nThis reply of August 8th nearly severed the negotiations on the spot:\r\nbut Talleyrand persistently refused to grant the passports which\r\nLauderdale demanded--evidently in the hope that the Czar's\r\nratification of Oubril's treaty would cause us to give up Sicily.[88]\r\nHe was in error. On September 3rd the news reached Paris that\r\nAlexander scornfully rejected his envoy's handiwork. Nevertheless,\r\nNapoleon refused to forego his claims to Sicily; and the closing days\r\nof Fox were embittered by the thought that this negotiation, the last\r\nhope of a career fruitful in disappointments, was doomed to failure.\r\nAfter using his splendid eloquence for fifteen years in defence of the\r\nRevolution and its \"heir,\" he came to the bitter conclusion that\r\nliberty had miscarried in France, and that that land had bent beneath\r\nthe yoke in order the more completely to subjugate the Continent. He\r\ndied on September 13th.\r\n\r\nFrench historians, following an article in the \"Moniteur\" of November\r\n26th, have often asserted that the death of Fox and the accession to\r\npower of the warlike faction changed the character of the\r\nnegotiations.[89] Nothing can be further from the truth. Not long\r\nbefore his end, Fox thus expressed to his nephew his despair of peace:\r\n\r\n    \"We can in honour do nothing without the full and _bonâ fide_\r\n    consent of the Queen and Court of Naples; but, even exclusive of\r\n    that consideration and of the great importance of Sicily, it is\r\n    not so much the value of the point in dispute as the manner in\r\n    which the French fly from their word that disheartens me. It is\r\n    not Sicily, but the shuffling, insincere way in which they act,\r\n    that shows me that they are playing a false game; and in that case\r\n    it would be very imprudent to make any concessions, which by any\r\n    possibility could be thought inconsistent with our honour, or\r\n    could furnish our allies with a plausible pretence for suspecting,\r\n    reproaching, or deserting us.\"\r\n\r\nIt is further to be noted that Lauderdale stayed on at Paris three\r\nweeks after the death of Fox; that he put forward no new demand, but\r\nrequired that Talleyrand should revert to his first promise of\r\nrenouncing all claim to Sicily, and should treat conjointly with\r\nEngland and Russia. It was in vain. Napoleon's final concessions were\r\nthat the Bourbons, after losing Sicily, should have the Balearic Isles\r\nand be pensioned _by Spain_; that Russia should hold Corfu (as she\r\nalready did); and that we should recover Hanover from Prussia, and\r\nkeep Malta, the Cape, Tobago, and the three French towns in India;\r\nbut, except Hanover, all of these were in our power. On Sicily he\r\nwould not bate one jot of his pretensions. The negotiations were\r\ntherefore broken off on October 6th, twelve days after Napoleon left\r\nParis to marshal his troops against Prussia.[90] The whole affair\r\nrevealed Napoleon's determination to trick the allies into signing\r\nseparate and disadvantageous treaties, and thus to regain by craft the\r\nground which he had lost in fair fight at Maida.\r\n\r\nIf Sicily was the rock of stumbling between us and Napoleon, Hanover\r\nwas the chief cause of the war between France and Prussia. During the\r\nnegotiations at Paris, Lord Yarmouth privately informed Lucchesini,\r\nthe Prussian ambassador, that Talleyrand made no difficulty about the\r\nrestitution of Hanover to George III. The news, when forwarded to\r\nBerlin at the close of July, caused a nervous flutter in ministerial\r\ncircles, where every effort was being made to keep on good terms with\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nEven before this news arrived, the task was far from easy. Murat, when\r\noccupying his new Duchy of Berg, pushed on his troops into the old\r\nChurch lands of Essen and Werden. Prussia looked on these districts as\r\nher own, and the sturdy patriot Blücher at once marched in his\r\nsoldiers, tore down Murat's proclamations, and restored the Prussian\r\neagle with blare of trumpet and beat of drum.[91] A collision was with\r\ndifficulty averted by the complaisance of Frederick William, who\r\ncalled back his troops and referred the question to lawyers; but even\r\nthe King was piqued when the Grand-Duke of Berg sent him a letter of\r\nremonstrance on Blücher's conduct, commencing with the familiar\r\naddress, _Mon frère_.\r\n\r\nBlücher meanwhile and the soldiery were eating out their hearts with\r\nrage, as they saw the French pouring across the Rhine, and\r\nconstructing a bridge of boats at Wesel; and had they known that that\r\nimportant stronghold, the key of North Germany, was quietly declared\r\nto be a French garrison town, they would probably have forced the\r\nhands of the King.[92] For at this time Frederick William and Haugwitz\r\nwere alarmed by the formation of the Rhenish Confederation, and were\r\nnot wholly reassured by Napoleon's suggestion that the abolition of\r\nthe old Empire must be an advantage to Prussia. They clutched eagerly,\r\nhowever, at his proposal that Prussia should form a league of the\r\nNorth German States, and made overtures to the two most important\r\nStates, Saxony and Hesse-Cassel. During a few halcyon days the King\r\neven proposed to assume the title _Emperor of Prussia_, from which,\r\nhowever, the Elector of Saxony ironically dissuaded him. This castle\r\nin the air faded away when news reached Berlin at the beginning of\r\nAugust that Napoleon was seeking to bring the Elector of Hesse-Cassel\r\ninto the Rhenish Confederation, and was offering as a bait the domains\r\nof some Imperial Knights and the principality of Fulda, now held by\r\nthe Prince of Orange, a relative of Frederick William. Moreover, the\r\nmoves of the French troops in Thuringia were so threatening to Saxony\r\nthat the Court of Dresden began to scout the project of a North German\r\nConfederation.\r\n\r\nStill, the King and Haugwitz tried to persuade themselves that\r\nNapoleon meant well for Prussia, that England had been doing her\r\nutmost to make bad blood between the two allies, and that \"great\r\nresults could not be attained without some friction.\" In this hope\r\nthey were encouraged by the French ambassador, the man who had enticed\r\nPrussia to her demobilization. He was charged by Talleyrand to report\r\nat Berlin that \"peace with England would be made, as well as with\r\nRussia, if France had consented to the restitution of Hanover.--I have\r\nrenewed,\" added Laforest, \"the assurance that the Emperor [Napoleon]\r\nwould never yield on this point.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet at that very time the French Foreign Office was at work upon a\r\nProject of a Treaty in which the restitution of Hanover to George III.\r\nwas expressly named and received the assent of Napoleon.[93] The\r\nPrussian ambassador, Lucchesini, had some inkling of this from French\r\nsources,[94] as well as from Lord Yarmouth, and on July 28th penned a\r\ndespatch which fell like a thunderbolt on the optimists of Berlin. It\r\ncrossed on the way--such is the irony of diplomacy--a despatch from\r\nBerlin that required him to show unlimited confidence in Napoleon.\r\nFrom confidence the King now rushed to the opposite extreme, and saw\r\nNapoleon's hand in all the friction of the last few weeks.\r\n\r\nHere again he was wrong; for the French Emperor had held back Murat\r\nand the other hot-bloods of the army who were longing to measure\r\nswords with Prussia.[95] His correspondence proves that his first\r\nthoughts were always in the Mediterranean. For one page that he wrote\r\nabout German affairs he wrote twenty to Joseph or Eugène on the need\r\nof keeping a firm hand and punishing Calabrian rebels--\"shoot three\r\nmen in every village\"--above all, on the plans for conquering Sicily.\r\nIt was therefore with real surprise that on August 16th-18th he learnt\r\nfrom a purloined despatch of Lucchesini that the latter suspected him\r\nof planning with the Czar the partition of Prussian Poland. He treated\r\nthe matter with contempt, and seems to have thought that Prussia would\r\nmeekly accept the morsels which he proposed to throw to her in place\r\nof Hanover. But he misread the character of Frederick William, if he\r\nthought so grievous an insult would be passed over, and he knew not\r\nthe power of the Prussian Queen to kindle the fire of patriotism.\r\n\r\nQueen Louisa was at this time thirty years of age and in the flower of\r\nthat noble matronly beauty which bespoke a pure and exalted being. As\r\ndaughter of a poverty-stricken prince of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, her\r\nyouth had been spent in the homeliest fashion, until her charms won\r\nthe heart of the Crown Prince of Prussia. Her first entry into Berlin\r\nwas graced by an act that proclaimed a loving nature. When a group of\r\nchildren dressed in white greeted her with verses of welcome, she\r\nlifted up and kissed their little leader, to the scandal of stiff\r\ndowagers, and the joy of the citizens. The incident recalls the easy\r\ngrace and disregard of etiquette shown by Marie Antoinette at\r\nVersailles in her young bridal days; and, in truth, these queens have\r\nsomething in common, besides their loveliness and their misfortunes.\r\nBoth were mated with cold and uninspiring consorts. Destiny had\r\nrefused both to Frederick William and to Louis XVI. the power of\r\nexciting feelings warmer than the esteem and respect due to a worthy\r\nman; and all the fervour of loyalty was aroused by their queens.\r\n\r\nLouisa was a North German Marie Antoinette, but more staid and homely\r\nthan the vivacious daughter of Maria Theresa. Neither did she\r\ninterfere much in politics, until the great crash came: even when the\r\nblow was impending, and the patriotic statesmen, with whom she\r\nsympathized, begged the King to remove Haugwitz, she disappointed them\r\nby withholding the entreaties which her instincts urged but her wifely\r\nobedience restrained. Her influence as yet was that of a noble,\r\nfascinating woman, who softened the jars occasioned by the King's\r\nnarrow and pedantic nature, and purified the Court from the grossness\r\nof the past. But in the dark days that were to come, her faith and\r\nenthusiasm breathed new force into a down-trodden people; and where\r\nall else was shattered, the King and Queen still held forth the ideal\r\nof that first and strongest of Teutonic institutions, a pure family\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe \"Memoirs\" of Hardenberg show that the Queen quietly upheld the\r\npatriotic cause;[96] and in the tone of the letter that Frederick\r\nWilliam wrote to the Czar (August 8th) there is something of feminine\r\nresentment against the French Emperor: after recounting his grievances\r\nat Napoleon's hands, he continued:\r\n\r\n    \"If the news be true, if he be capable of perfidy so black, be\r\n    convinced, Sire, that it is not merely a question about Hanover\r\n    between him and me, but that he has decided to make war against me\r\n    at all costs. He wants no other Power beside his own.... Tell me,\r\n    Sire, I conjure you, if I may hope that your troops will be within\r\n    reach of succour for me, and if I may count on them in case of\r\n    aggression.\"\r\n\r\nAlexander wrote a cheering response, advising him to settle his\r\ndifferences with England and Sweden, and assuring him of help.\r\nWhereupon the King replied (September 6th) that he had reopened the\r\nNorth Sea rivers to British ships and hoped for peace and pecuniary\r\nhelp from London. He concluded thus:\r\n\r\n    \"Meanwhile, Bonaparte has left me at my ease: for not only does he\r\n    not enter into any explanation about my armaments, but he has even\r\n    forbidden his Ministers to give and receive any explanations\r\n    whatever. It appears, then, that it is I who am to take the\r\n    initiative. My troops are marching on all sides to hasten that\r\n    moment.\"[97]\r\n\r\nThese last sentences are the handwriting on the wall for the _ancien\r\nrégime_ in Prussia. Taking the bland assurances of Talleyrand and the\r\nstudied indifference of Laforest as signs that Napoleon might be\r\ncaught off his guard, Prussia continued her warlike preparations; and\r\nin order to gain time Lucchesini was recalled and replaced by an envoy\r\nwho was to enter into lengthy explanations. The trick did not deceive\r\nNapoleon, who on September 3rd had heard with much surprise that\r\nRussia meant to continue the war. At once he saw the germ of a new\r\nCoalition, and bent his energies to the task of conciliating Austria,\r\nand of fomenting the disputes between Russia and Turkey. Towards\r\nFrederick William his tone was that of a friend who grieves at an\r\nunexpected quarrel. How--he exclaimed to Lucchesini on the\r\nambassador's departure--how could the King credit him with encouraging\r\nthe intrigues of a fussy ambassador at Cassel or the bluster of Murat?\r\n\r\nAs for Hanover, he had intended sending some one to Berlin to propose\r\nan equivalent for it in case England still made its restitution a\r\n_sine quâ non_ of peace. \"But,\" he added, \"if your young officers and\r\nyour women at Berlin want war, I am preparing to satisfy them. Yet my\r\nambition turns wholly to Italy. She is a mistress whose favours I will\r\nshare with no one. I will have all the Adriatic. The Pope shall be my\r\nvassal, and I will conquer Sicily. On North Germany I have no claims:\r\nI do not object to the Hanse towns entering your confederation. As to\r\nthe inclusion of Saxony in it, my mind is not yet made up.\"[98]\r\n\r\nIndeed, the tenor of his private correspondence proves that before the\r\nfirst week of September he did not expect a new Coalition. He believed\r\nthat England and Russia would give way before him, and that Prussia\r\nwould never dare to stir. For the Court of Berlin he had a sovereign\r\ncontempt, as for the \"old coalition machines\" in general. His conduct\r\nof affairs at this time betokens, not so much desire for war as lack\r\nof imagination where other persons' susceptibilities are concerned. It\r\nis probable that he then wanted peace with England and peace on the\r\nContinent; for his diplomacy won conquests fully as valuable as the\r\nbooty of his sword, and only in a naval peace could he lay the\r\nfoundations of that oriental empire which, he assured O'Meara at St.\r\nHelena, held the first place in his thoughts after the overthrow of\r\nAustria. But it was not in his nature to make the needful concessions.\r\n\"_I must follow my policy in a geometrical line_\" he said to\r\nLucchesini. England might have Hanover and a few colonies if she would\r\nlet Sicily go to a Bonaparte: as for Prussia, she might absorb\r\nhalf-a-dozen neighbouring princelings.\r\n\r\nThat is the gist of Napoleon's European policy in the summer of 1806;\r\nand the surprise which he expressed to Mollien at the rejection of his\r\noffers is probably genuine. Sensitive to the least insult himself, his\r\nbluntness of perception respecting the honour of others might almost\r\nqualify him to rank with Aristotle's man devoid of feeling. It is\r\nperfectly true that he did not make war on Prussia in 1806 any more\r\nthan on England in 1803. He only made peace impossible.[99]\r\n\r\nThe condition on which Prussia now urgently insisted was the entire\r\nevacuation of Germany by French troops. This Napoleon refused to\r\nconcede until Frederick William demobilized his army, a step that\r\nwould have once more humbled him in the eyes of this people. It might\r\neven have led to his dethronement. For an incident had just occurred\r\nin Bavaria that fanned German sentiment to a flame. A bookseller of\r\nNuremberg, named Palm, was proved by French officers to have sold an\r\nanonymous pamphlet entitled \"Germany in her deep Humiliation.\" It was\r\nby no means of a revolutionary type, and the worthy man believed it to\r\nbe a mistake when he was arrested by the military authorities. He was\r\nwrong. Napoleon had sent orders that a terrible example must be made\r\nin order to stop the sale of patriotic German pamphlets. Palm was\r\ntherefore haled away to Braunau, an Austrian town then held by French\r\ntroops, was tried by martial law and shot (August 25th). Never did the\r\nEmperor commit a greater blunder. The outrage sent a thrill of\r\nindignation through the length and breadth of Germany. Instead of\r\nquenching, it inflamed the national sentiment, and thus rendered\r\ndoubly difficult any peaceful compromise between Frederick William and\r\nNapoleon. The latter was now looked upon as a tyrant by the citizen\r\nclass which his reforms were designed to conciliate: and Frederick\r\nWilliam became almost the champion of Germany when he demanded the\r\nwithdrawal of the French troops.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the King refused to appoint Ministers who inspired\r\nconfidence. With Hardenberg in place of Haugwitz, men would have felt\r\nsure that the sword would not again be tamely sheathed; great efforts\r\nwere made to effect this change, but met with a chilling repulse from\r\nthe King.[100] It is true that Haugwitz and Beyme now expressed the\r\nbitterest hatred of Napoleon, as well they might for a man who had\r\nbetrayed their confidence. But, none the less, the King's refusal to\r\nchange his men along with his policy was fatal. Both at St. Petersburg\r\nand London no trust was felt in Prussia as long as Haugwitz was at the\r\nhelm. The man who had twice steered the ship of state under Napoleon's\r\nguns might do it again; and both England and Russia waited to see some\r\nirrevocable step taken before they again risked an army for that\r\nprince of waverers.\r\n\r\nGrenville rather tardily sent Lord Morpeth to arrange an alliance, but\r\nonly after he should receive a solemn pledge that Hanover would be\r\nrestored. That envoy approached the Prussian headquarters just in time\r\nto be swept away in the torrent of fugitives from Jena. As for Russia,\r\nshe had awaited the arrival of a Prussian officer at St. Petersburg to\r\nconcert a plan of campaign. When he arrived he had no plan; and the\r\nCzar, perplexed by the fatuity of his ally, and the hostility of the\r\nTurks, refused to march his troops forthwith into Prussia.[101]\r\nEqually disappointing was the conduct of Austria. This Power, bleeding\r\nfrom the wounds of last year and smarting under the jealousy of\r\nRussia, refused to move until the allies had won a victory. And so,\r\nthanks to the jealousies of the old monarchies, Frederick William had\r\nno Russian or Austrian troops at his side, no sinews of war from\r\nLondon to invigorate his preparations, when he staked his all in the\r\nhigh places of Thuringia. He gained, it is true, the support of Saxony\r\nand Weimar; but this brought less than 21,000 men to his side.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Napoleon, as Protector of the Rhenish\r\nConfederation, secured the aid of 25,000 South Germans, as well as an\r\nexcellent fortified base at Würzburg. His troops, holding the citadels\r\nof Passau and Braunau on the Austrian frontier, kept the Hapsburgs\r\nquiet; and 60,000 French and Dutch troops at Wesel menaced the\r\nPrussians in Hanover. Above all, his forces already in Germany were\r\nstrengthened until, in the early days of October, some 200,000 men\r\nwere marching from the Main towards the Duchy of Weimar. Soult and Ney\r\nled 60,000 men from Amberg towards Baireuth and Hof: Bernadotte and\r\nDavoust, with 90,000, marched towards Schleitz, while Lannes and\r\nAugereau, with 46,000, moved by a road further to the left towards\r\nSaalfeld.\r\n\r\nThe progress of these dense columns near together and through a hilly\r\ncountry presented great difficulties, which only the experience of the\r\nofficers, the energy and patience of the men, and the genius of their\r\ngreat leader could overcome. Meanwhile Napoleon had quietly left Paris\r\non September 25th. Travelling at his usual rapid rate, he reached\r\nMainz on the 28th: he was at Würzburg on October 2nd; there he\r\ndirected the operations, confident that the impact of his immense\r\nforce would speedily break the Prussians, drive them down the valley\r\nof the Saale and thus detach the Elector of Saxony from an alliance\r\nthat already was irksome.\r\n\r\nThe French, therefore, had a vast mass of seasoned fighters, a good\r\nbase of operations, and a clear plan of attack. The Prussians, on the\r\ncontrary, could muster barely 128,000 men, including the Saxons, for\r\nservice in the field; and of these 27,000 with Rüchel were on the\r\nfrontier of Hesse-Cassel seeking to assure the alliance of the\r\nElector. The commander-in-chief was the septuagenarian Duke of\r\nBrunswick, well known for his failure at Valmy in 1792 and his recent\r\nsupport to the policy of complaisance to France. His appointment\r\naroused anger and consternation; and General Kalckreuth expressed to\r\nGentz the general opinion when he said that the Duke was quite\r\nincompetent for such a command: \"His character is not strong enough,\r\nhis mediocrity, irresolution, and untrustworthiness would ruin the\r\nbest undertaking.\" The Duke himself was aware of his incompetence. Why\r\nthen, we ask, did he accept the command? The answer is startling; but\r\nit rests on the evidence of General von Müffling:\r\n\r\n    \"The Duke of Brunswick had accepted the command _in order to avert\r\n    war_. I can affirm this with perfect certainty, since I have heard\r\n    it from his own lips more than once. He was fully aware of the\r\n    weaknesses of the Prussian army and the incompetence of its\r\n    officers.\"[102]\r\n\r\nThus there was seen the strange sight of a diffident, peace-loving\r\nKing accompanying the army and sharing in all the deliberations; while\r\nthese were nominally presided over by a despondent old man who still\r\nintrigued to preserve peace, and shifted on to the King the\r\nresponsibility of every important act. And yet there were able\r\ngenerals who could have acted with effect, even if they fell short of\r\nthe opinion hopefully bruited by General Rüchel, that \"several were\r\nequal to M. de Bonaparte.\" Events were to prove that Gneisenau,\r\nScharnhorst, and Blücher rivalled the best of the French Marshals; but\r\nin this war their lights were placed under bushels and only shone\r\nforth when the official covers had been shattered. Scharnhorst,\r\nalready renowned for his strategic and administrative genius, took\r\npart in some of the many councils of war where everything was\r\ndiscussed and little was decided; but his opinion had no weight, for\r\non October 7th he wrote: \"What we ought to do I know right well, what\r\nwe _shall_ do only the gods know.\"[103] He evidently referred to the\r\nneed of concentration. At that time the thin Prussian lines were\r\nspread out over a front of eighty-five miles, the Saxons being near\r\nGera, the chief army, under Brunswick, at Erfurth, while Rüchel was so\r\nfar distant on the west that he could only come up at Jena just one\r\nhour too late to avert disaster.\r\n\r\nAnd yet with these weak and scattered forces, Prince Hohenlohe\r\nproposed a bold move forward to the Main. Brunswick, on the other\r\nhand, counselled a prudent defensive; but he could not, or would not,\r\nenforce his plan; and the result was an oscillation between the two\r\nextremes. Had he massed all his forces so as to command the valleys of\r\nthe Saale and Elster near Jena and Gera, the campaign might possibly\r\nhave been prolonged until the Russians came up. As it was, the allies\r\ndulled the ardour of their troops by marches, counter-marches, and\r\ninterminable councils-of-war, while Napoleon's columns were threading\r\ntheir way along those valleys at the average rate of fifteen miles a\r\nday, in order to turn the allied left and cut the connection between\r\nPrussia and Saxony.[104]\r\n\r\nThe first serious fighting was on October the 10th at Saalfeld, where\r\nPrince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia with a small force sought to protect\r\nHohenlohe's flank march westwards on Jena. The task was beyond the\r\nstrength even of this flower of Prussian chivalry. He was overpowered\r\nby the weight and vigour of Lannes' attack, and when already wounded\r\nin a cavalry _mêlée_ was pierced through the body by an officer to\r\nwhom he proudly refused to surrender. The death of this hero, the\r\n\"Alcibiades\" of Prussia, cast a gloom over the whole army, and\r\nmournful faces at headquarters seemed to presage yet worse disasters.\r\nPerhaps it was some inkling of this discouragement, or a laudable\r\ndesire to stop \"an impolitic war,\" that urged Napoleon two days later\r\nto pen a letter to the King of Prussia urging him to make peace before\r\nhe was crushed, as he assuredly would be. In itself the letter seems\r\nadmirable--until one remembers the circumstances of the case. The King\r\nhad pledged his word to the Czar to make war; if, therefore, he now\r\nmade peace and sent the Russians back, he would once more stand\r\ncondemned of preferring dishonourable ease to the noble hazards of an\r\naffair of honour. As Napoleon was aware of the union of the King and\r\nCzar, this letter must be regarded as an attempt to dissolve the\r\nalliance and tarnish Frederick William's reputation. It was viewed in\r\nthat light by that monarch; and there is not a hint in Napoleon's\r\nother letters that he really expected peace.\r\n\r\nHe was then at Gera, pushing forward his corps towards Naumburg so as\r\nto cut off the Prussians from Saxony and the Elbe. Great as was his\r\nsuperiority, these movements occasioned such a dispersion of his\r\nforces as to invite attack from enterprising foes; but he despised the\r\nPrussian generals as imbeciles, and endeavoured to unsteady their rank\r\nand file by seizing and burning their military stores at the latter\r\ntown. He certainly believed that they were all in retreat northwards,\r\nand great was his surprise when he heard from Lannes early on October\r\n13th that his scouts, after scaling the hills behind Jena in a dense\r\nmist, had come upon the Prussian army. The news was only partly\r\ncorrect. It was only Hohenlohe's corps: for the bulk of that army,\r\nunder Brunswick, was retreating northwards, and nearly stumbled upon\r\nthe corps of Davoust and Bernadotte behind Naumburg.\r\n\r\nLannes also was in danger on the Landgrafenberg. This is a lofty hill\r\nwhich towers above the town of Jena and the narrow winding vale of the\r\nSaale; while its other slopes, to the north and west, rise above and\r\ndominate the broken and irregular plateau on which Hohenlohe's force\r\nwas encamped. Had the Prussians attacked his weary regiments in force,\r\nthey might easily have hurled them into the Saale. But Hohenlohe had\r\nreceived orders to retire northwards in the rear of Brunswick, as soon\r\nas he had rallied the detachment of Rüchel near Weimar, and was\r\ntherefore indisposed to venture on the bold offensive which now was\r\nhis only means of safety. The respite thus granted was used by the\r\nFrench to hurry every available regiment up the slopes north and west\r\nof Jena. Late in the afternoon, Napoleon himself ascended the\r\nLandgrafenberg to survey the plateau; while a pastor of the town was\r\ncompelled to show a path further north which leads to the same plateau\r\nthrough a gulley called the Rau-thal.[105]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF JENA]\r\n\r\nOn the south the heights sink away into a wider valley, the Mühl-thal,\r\nalong which runs the road to Weimar; and on this side too their wooded\r\nbrows are broken by gulleys, up one of which runs a winding track\r\nknown as the Schnecke or Snail. Villages and woods diversified the\r\nplateau and hindered the free use of that extended line formation on\r\nwhich the Prussians relied, while favouring the operations of dense\r\ncolumns preceded by clouds of skirmishers by which Napoleon so often\r\nhewed his way to victory. His greatest advantage, however, lay in the\r\nignorance of his foes. Hohenlohe, believing that he was confronted\r\nonly by Lannes' corps, took little thought about what was going on in\r\nhis front, and judging the Mühl-thal approach alone to be accessible,\r\nposted his chief force on this side. So insufficient a guard was\r\ntherefore kept on the side of the Landgrafenberg that the French,\r\nunder cover of the darkness, not only crowned the summit densely with\r\ntroops, but dragged up whole batteries of cannon.\r\n\r\nThe toil was stupendous: in one of the steep hollow tracks a number of\r\ncannon and wagons stuck fast; but the Emperor, making his rounds at\r\nmidnight, brought the magic of his presence to aid the weary troops\r\nand rebuke the officers whose negligence had caused this block.\r\nLantern in hand, he went up and down the line to direct the work; and\r\nSavary, who saw this scene, noted the wonder of the men, as they\r\ncaught sight of the Emperor, the renewed energy of their blows at the\r\nrocks, and their whispers of surprise that _he_ should come in person\r\nwhen their officers were asleep. The night was far spent when, after\r\nseeing the first wagon right through the narrow steep, he repaired to\r\nhis bivouac amidst his Guards on the summit, and issued further orders\r\nbefore snatching a brief repose. By such untiring energy did he assure\r\nvictory. Apart from its immense effect on the spirits of his troops,\r\nhis vigilance reaped a rich reward. Jena was won by a rapid\r\nconcentration of troops, and the prompt seizure of a commanding\r\nposition almost under the eyes of an unenterprising enemy. The corps\r\nof Soult and Ney spent most of the night and early morning in marching\r\ntowards Jena and taking up their positions on the right or north wing,\r\nwhile Lannes and the Guard held the central height, and Augereau's\r\ncorps in the Mühl-thal threatened the Saxons and Prussians guarding\r\nthe Schnecke.[106]\r\n\r\nA dense fog screened the moves of the assailants early on the morrow,\r\nand, after some confused but obstinate fighting, the French secured\r\ntheir hold on the plateau not only above the town of Jena, where their\r\nonset took the Prussians by surprise, but also above the Mühl-thal,\r\nwhere the enemy were in force.\r\n\r\nBy ten o'clock the fog lifted, and the warm rays of the autumn sun\r\nshowed the dense masses of the French advancing towards the middle of\r\nthe plateau. Hohenlohe now saw the full extent of his error and\r\ndespatched an urgent message to Rüchel for aid. It was too late. The\r\nFrench centre, led by Lannes, began to push back the Prussian lines on\r\nthe village named Vierzehn Heiligen. It was in vain that Hohenlohe's\r\nchoice squadrons flung themselves on the serried masses in front: the\r\nartillery and musketry fire disordered them, while French dragoons\r\nwere ready to profit by their confusion. The village was lost, then\r\nretaken by a rally of the Prussians, then lost again when Ney was\r\nreinforced; and when the full vigour of the French attack was\r\ndeveloped by the advance of Soult and Augereau on either wing,\r\nNapoleon launched his reserves, his Guard, and Murat's squadrons on\r\nthe disordered lines. The impact was irresistible, and Hohenlohe's\r\nforce was swept away. Then it was that Rüchel's force drew near, and\r\nstrove to stem the rout. Advancing steadily, as if on parade, his\r\ntroops for a brief space held up the French onset; but neither the\r\ndash of the Prussian horse nor the bravery of the foot-soldiers could\r\ndam that mighty tide, which laid low the gallant leader and swept his\r\nlines away into the general wreck.[107]\r\n\r\nIn the headlong flight before Murat's horsemen, the fugitives fell in\r\nwith another beaten array, that of Brunswick. At Jena the Prussians,\r\nif defeated, were not disgraced: before the first shot was fired their\r\ndefeat was a mathematical certainty. At the crisis of the battle they\r\nhad but 47,400 men at hand, while Napoleon then disposed of 83,600\r\ncombatants.[108] But at Auerstädt they were driven back and disgraced.\r\nThere they had a decided superiority in numbers, having more than\r\n35,000 of their choicest troops, while opposite to them stood only the\r\n27,000 men of Davoust's corps.\r\n\r\nHitherto Davoust had been remarkable rather for his dog-like devotion\r\nto Napoleon than for any martial genius; and the brilliant Marmont had\r\nopenly scoffed at his receiving the title of Marshal. But, under his\r\nquiet exterior and plodding habits, there lay concealed a variety of\r\ngifts which only needed a great occasion to shine forth and astonish\r\nthe world.[109] The time was now at hand. Frederick William and\r\nBrunswick were marching from Auerstädt to make good their retreat on\r\nthe Elbe, when their foremost horsemen, led by the gallant Blücher,\r\nsaw a solid wall of French infantry loom through the morning fog. It\r\nwas part of Davoust's corps, strongly posted in and around the village\r\nof Hassenhausen.\r\n\r\nAt once Blücher charged, only to be driven back with severe loss.\r\nAgain he came on, this time supported by infantry and cannon: again he\r\nwas repulsed; for Davoust, aided by the fog, had seized the\r\nneighbouring heights which commanded the high road, and held them with\r\nfirm grip. Determined to brush aside or crush this stubborn foe, the\r\nDuke of Brunswick now led heavy masses along the narrow defile; but\r\nthe steady fire of the French laid him low, with most of the officers;\r\nand as the Prussians fell back, Davoust swung forward his men to\r\nthreaten their flanks. The King was dismayed at these repeated checks,\r\nand though the Prussian reserves under Kalckreuth could have been\r\ncalled up to overwhelm the hard-pressed French by the weight of\r\nnumbers, yet he judged it better to draw off his men and fall back on\r\nHohenlohe for support.\r\n\r\nBut what a support! Instead of an army, it was a terrified mob flying\r\nbefore Murat's sabres, that met them halfway between Auerstädt and\r\nWeimar. Threatened also by Bernadotte's corps on their left flank, the\r\ntwo Prussian armies now melted away in one indistinguishable torrent,\r\nthat was stemmed only by the sheltering walls of Erfurt, Magdeburg,\r\nand of fortresses yet more remote.\r\n\r\nOf the twin battles of Jena and Auerstädt, the latter was\r\nunquestionably the more glorious for the French arms. That Napoleon\r\nshould have beaten an army of little more than half his numbers is in\r\nno way remarkable. What is strange is that so consummate a leader\r\nshould have been entirely ignorant of the distribution of the enemy's\r\nforces, and should have left Davoust with only 27,000 men exposed to\r\nthe attack of Brunswick with nearly 40,000.[110] In his bulletins, as\r\nin the \"Relation Officielle,\" the Emperor sought to gloze over his\r\nerror by magnifying Hohenlohe's corps into a great army and\r\nattenuating Davoust's splendid exploit, which in his private letters\r\nhe warmly praised. The fact is, he had made all his dispositions in\r\nthe belief that he had the main body of the Prussians before him at\r\nJena.\r\n\r\nThat is why, on the afternoon of the 13th, he hastily sent to recall\r\nMurat's horse and Bernadotte's corps from Naumburg and its vicinity;\r\nand in consequence Bernadotte took no very active part in the\r\nfighting. For this he has been bitterly blamed, on the strength of an\r\nassertion that Napoleon during the night of the 13th-14th sent him an\r\norder to support Davoust. This order has never been produced, and it\r\nfinds no place in the latest and fullest collection of French official\r\ndespatches, which, however, contains some that fully exonerate\r\nBernadotte.[111] Unfortunately for Bernadotte's fame, the tattle of\r\nmemoir writers is more attractive and gains more currency than the\r\nprosaic facts of despatches.\r\n\r\nFortune plays an immense part in warfare; and never did she favour the\r\nEmperor more than on October the 14th, 1806. Fortune and the skill and\r\nbravery of Davoust and his corps turned what might have been an almost\r\ndoubtful conflict into an overwhelming victory. Though Napoleon was as\r\nignorant of the movements of Brunswick as he was of the flank march of\r\nBlücher at Waterloo, yet the enterprise and tenacity of Davoust and\r\nLannes yielded him, on the Thuringian heights, a triumph scarcely\r\nparalleled in the annals of war. It is difficult to overpraise those\r\nMarshals for the energy with which they clung to the foe and brought\r\non a battle under conditions highly favourable to the French: without\r\ntheir efforts, the Prussian army could never have been shattered on a\r\nsingle day.\r\n\r\nThe flood of invasion now roared down the Thuringian valleys and\r\ndeluged the plains of Saxony and Brandenburg. Rivers and ramparts were\r\nalike helpless to stay that all-devouring tide. On October the 16th,\r\n16,000 men surrendered at Erfurt to Murat: then, spurring eastward,\r\n_le beau sabreur_ rushed on the wreck of Hohenlohe's force, and with\r\nthe aid of Lannes' untiring corps compelled it to surrender at\r\nPrenzlau.[112] Blücher meanwhile stubbornly retreated to the north;\r\nbut, with Murat, Soult, and Bernadotte dogging his steps, he finally\r\nthrew himself into Lübeck, where, after a last desperate effort, he\r\nsurrendered to overpowering numbers (November 7th).\r\n\r\nHere the gloom of defeat was relieved by gleams of heroism; but before\r\nthe walls of other Prussian strongholds disaster was blackened by\r\ndisgrace. Held by timid old men or nerveless pedants, they scarcely\r\nwaited for a vigorous attack. A few cannon-shots, or even a\r\ndemonstration of cavalry, generally brought out the white flag. In\r\nquick succession, Spandau, Stettin, Küstrin, Magdeburg, and Hameln\r\nopened their gates, the governor of the last-named being mainly\r\nconcerned about securing his future retiring pension from the French\r\nas soon as Hanover passed into their keeping.\r\n\r\nAmidst these shameful surrenders the capital fell into the hands of\r\nDavoust (October 25th). Varnhagen von Ense had described his mingled\r\nsurprise and admiration at seeing those \"lively, impudent,\r\nmean-looking little fellows,\" who had beaten the splendid soldiers\r\ntrained in the school of Frederick the Great. His wonder was natural;\r\nbut all who looked beneath the surface well knew that Prussia was\r\noverthrown before the first shot was fired. She was the victim of a\r\ndeadening barrack routine, of official apathy or corruption, and of a\r\ndegrading policy which dulled the enthusiasm of her sons.\r\n\r\nThirteen days after the great battle, Napoleon himself entered Berlin\r\nin triumph. It was the first time that he allowed himself a victor's\r\nprivilege, and no pains were spared to impress the imagination of\r\nmankind by a parade of his choicest troops. First came the foot\r\ngrenadiers and chasseurs of the Imperial Guard: behind the central\r\ngroup marched other squadrons and battalions of these veterans,\r\nalready famed as the doughtiest fighters of their age. In their midst\r\ncame the mind of this military machine--Napoleon, accompanied by three\r\nMarshals and a brilliant staff. Among them men noted the plain,\r\nsoldierlike Berthier, the ever trusty and methodical chief of the\r\nstaff. At his side rode Davoust, whose round and placid face gave\r\nlittle promise of his rapid rush to the front rank among the French\r\npaladins. There too was the tall, handsome, threatening form of\r\nAugereau, whose services at Jena, meritorious as they were, scarcely\r\nmaintained his fame at the high level to which it soared at\r\nCastiglione. Then came Napoleon's favourite aide-de-camp, Duroc, a\r\nshort, stern, war-hardened man, well known in Berlin, where twice he\r\nhad sought to rivet close the bonds of the French alliance.\r\n\r\nAbove all, the gaze of the awe-struck crowd was fixed on the figure of\r\nthe chief, now grown to the roundness of robust health amidst toils\r\nthat would have worn most men to a shadow; and on the face, no longer\r\nthin with the unsatisfied longings of youth, but square and full with\r\ntoil requited and ambition wellnigh sated--a visage redeemed from the\r\ncoarseness of the epicure's only by the knitted brows that bespoke\r\nceaseless thought, and by the keen, melancholy, unfathomable eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE ADDED TO THE FOURTH EDITION\r\n\r\n    Several facts of considerable interest and importance respecting\r\n    the Anglo-French negotiations of 1806 have been brought to light\r\n    by M. Coquelle in his recently published work \"Napoleon and\r\n    England, 1803-1813,\" chapters xi.-xvii. (George Bell and Sons,\r\n    1904).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE CONTINENTAL SYSTEM: FRIEDLAND\r\n\r\n    \"I know full well that London is a corner of the world, and that\r\n    Paris is its centre.\"--_Letter of Napoleon_, August 18th, 1806.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of November, 1806, Napoleon issued at Berlin the decree\r\nwhich proclaimed open and unrelenting war on English industry and\r\ncommerce, a war that was to embroil the whole civilized world and\r\ncease only with his overthrow. After reciting his complaints against\r\nthe English maritime code, he declared the British Isles to be in a\r\nstate of blockade, interdicted all commerce with them, threatened\r\nseizure and imprisonment to English goods and subjects wherever found\r\nby French or allied troops, forbade all trade in English and colonial\r\nwares, and excluded from French and allied ports any ship that had\r\ntouched at those of Great Britain; while any ship that connived at the\r\ninfraction of the present decree was to be held a good prize of\r\nwar.[113] This ukase, which was binding for France, Italy,\r\nSwitzerland, Holland, and the Rhenish Confederation, formed the\r\nfoundation of the Continental System, a term applicable to the sum\r\ntotal of the measures that aimed at ruining England by excluding her\r\ngoods from the Continent.\r\n\r\nThe plan of strangling Britain by her own wealth was not peculiar to\r\nNapoleon. In common with much of his political stock-in-trade he had\r\nit from the Jacobins, who stoutly maintained that England's wealth was\r\nfictitious and would collapse as soon as her commerce was attacked in\r\nthe Indies and excluded from the Rhine and Elbe. At first the\r\nfulminations of Parisian legislators fell idly on the stately pile of\r\nBritish industry; but when the young Bonaparte appeared on the scene,\r\nthe commercial warfare became serious. As soon as his victories in\r\nItaly widened the sphere of French influence, the Directory banned the\r\nentry of all our products, counting all cotton and woollen goods as\r\nEnglish unless the contrary could be proved by certificates of\r\norigin.[114] Public opinion in France, which, unless held in by an\r\nintelligent monarch, has always swung towards protection or\r\nprohibition, welcomed that vigorous measure; and great was the outcry\r\nof manufacturers when it was rumoured in 1802 that Napoleon was about\r\nto make a commercial treaty with the national enemy. Tradition and\r\ncustom, therefore, were all on his side, when, after Trafalgar, he\r\nconcentrated all his energy on his \"coast-system.\"[115]\r\n\r\nOstensibly the Berlin Decree was a retort to our Order in Council of\r\nMay 16th, 1806, which declared all the coast between Brest and the\r\nElbe in a state of blockade; and French historians have defended it on\r\nthis ground, asserting that it was a necessary reply to England's\r\naggressive action.[116] But this plea can scarcely be maintained. The\r\naggressor, surely, was the man who forced Prussia to close the neutral\r\nNorth German coast to British goods (February, 1806). Besides, there\r\nis indirect proof that Napoleon looked on our blockade of the northern\r\ncoasts as not unreasonable. In his subsequent negotiations with us, he\r\nraised no protest against it, and made no difficulty about our\r\nmaritime code: if we would let him seize Sicily, we might, it seems,\r\nhave re-enacted that code in all its earlier stringency. Far from\r\ndoing so, Fox and his successors relaxed the blockade of North\r\nGermany; and by an order dated September 25th, the coast between the\r\nElbe and the Ems was declared free.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's grievance against us was thereby materially lessened, and\r\nhis protest against fictitious blockades in the preamble of the Berlin\r\nDecree really applied only to our action on the coast between the\r\nHelder and Brest, where our cruisers were watching the naval\r\npreparations still going on. His retort in the interests of outraged\r\nlaw was certainly curious; he declared our 3,000 miles of coast in a\r\nstate of blockade--a mere _brutum fulmen_ in point of fact, but\r\ndesigned to give a show of legality to his Continental System. Yet,\r\napart from this thin pretext, he troubled very little about law.\r\nIndeed, blockade is an act of war; and its application to this or that\r\npart or coast depends on the will and power of the belligerents.\r\nNapoleon frankly recognized that fact; and, however much his preambles\r\nappealed to law, his conduct was decided solely by expediency. When he\r\nwanted peace (along with Sicily) he said nothing about our maritime\r\nclaims: when the war went on, he used them as a pretext for an action\r\nthat was ten times as stringent.\r\n\r\nThe gauntlet thrown down by him at Berlin was promptly taken up by\r\nGreat Britain. An Order in Council of January 7th, 1807, forbade\r\nneutrals to trade between the ports of France and her allies, or\r\nbetween ports that observed the Berlin Decree, under pain of seizure\r\nand confiscation of the ship and cargo. In return Napoleon issued from\r\nWarsaw (January 27th) a decree, ordering the seizure in the Hanse\r\nTowns of all English goods and colonial produce. By way of reprisal\r\nEngland reimposed a strict blockade on the North German coast (March\r\n11th); and after the Peace of Tilsit laid the Continent at the feet of\r\nNapoleon, he frankly told the diplomatic circle at Fontainebleau that\r\nhe would no longer allow any commercial or political relations between\r\nthe Continent and England. \"The sea must be subdued by the land.\" In\r\nthese words Napoleon pithily summed up his enterprise; and whatever\r\nmay be thought of the means which he adopted, the design is not\r\nwithout grandeur. Granted that Britannia ruled the waves, yet he ruled\r\nthe land; and the land, as the active fruitful element, must overpower\r\nthe barren sea. Such was the notion: it was fallacious, as will appear\r\nlater on; but it appealed strongly to the French imagination as\r\nproviding an infallible means of humbling the traditional foe.\r\nFurthermore, it placed in Napoleon's hands a potent engine of\r\ngovernment, not only for assuring his position in France, but for\r\nextending his sway over North Germany and all coasts that seemed\r\nneedful to the success of the experiment.\r\n\r\nIndirectly also it seems to have fed, without satisfying, his\r\never-growing love of power. Here we touch on the difficult question of\r\nmotive; and it is perhaps impossible, except for dogmatists, to\r\ndetermine whether the enterprises that led to his ruin--the partition\r\nof Portugal, which slid easily into the occupation of Spain, together\r\nwith his Moscow adventure--were prompted by ambition or by a\r\nsemi-fatalistic feeling that they were necessary to the complete\r\ntriumph of his Continental System. He himself, with a flash of almost\r\nuncanny insight, once remarked to Roederer that his ambition was\r\ndifferent from that of other men: for they were slaves to it, whereas\r\nit was so interwoven with the whole texture of his being as to\r\ninterfere with no single process of thought and will. Whether that is\r\npossible is a question for psychologists and casuists; but every\r\nopen-minded student of Napoleon's career must at times pause in utter\r\ndoubt, whether this or that act was prompted by mad ambition, or\r\nfollowed naturally, perhaps inevitably, from that world-embracing\r\npostulate, the Continental System.\r\n\r\nEngland also derived some secondary advantages from this war of the\r\nelements. In order to stalemate her mighty foe, she pushed on her\r\ncolonial conquests so as to control the resources of the tropics, and\r\nthus prevent that deadly tilting of the balance landwards which\r\nNapoleon strove to effect. And fate decreed that the conquests of\r\nEnglish seamen and settlers were to be more enduring than those of\r\nNapoleon's legions. While the French were gaining barren victories\r\nbeyond the Vistula and Ebro, our seamen seized French and Dutch\r\ncolonies and our pioneers opened up the interior of Australia and\r\nSouth Africa.\r\n\r\nWe also used our maritime monopoly to depress neutral commerce. We\r\nhave not space to discuss the complex question of the rights of\r\nneutrals in time of war, which would involve an examination of the\r\n\"rule of 1756\" and the compromises arrived at after the two Armed\r\nNeutrality Leagues. Suffice it to say that our merchants had recently\r\nbeen indignant at the comparative immunity enjoyed by neutral ships,\r\nand had pressed for more vigorous action against such as traded to\r\nFrench ports.[117] Yet the statement that our Orders in Council were\r\ndetermined by the clamour of the mercantile class is an exaggeration:\r\nthey were reprisals against Napoleon's acts, following them in almost\r\ngeometrical gradations. To his domination over the industrial\r\nresources of the Continent we had nothing to oppose but our\r\nmanufacturing skill, our supremacy in the tropics, and our control of\r\nthe sea. The methods used on both sides were alike brutal, and, when\r\ncarried to their logical conclusion at the close of the year, crushed\r\nthe neutrals between the upper and the nether millstone. But it is\r\ndifficult to see what other alternative was open to an insular State\r\nthat was all-powerful at sea and weak on land. Our very existence was\r\nbound up with maritime commerce; and an abandonment of the carrying\r\ntrade to neutrals would have been the tamest of surrenders, at a time\r\nwhen surrender meant political extinction.\r\n\r\nWe turn now to follow the chief steps in Napoleon's onward march,\r\nwhich enabled him to impose his system on nearly the whole of the\r\nContinent. While encamped in the Prussian capital he decreed the\r\ndeposition of the Elector of Hesse-Cassel, and French and Dutch troops\r\nforthwith occupied that Electorate. Towards Saxony he acted with\r\npolitic clemency; and on December 11th, 1806, the Elector accepted the\r\nFrench alliance, entered the Confederation of the Rhine, and received\r\nthe title of King.[118]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Frederick William, accompanied by his grief-stricken\r\nconsort, was striving to draw together an army in his eastern\r\nprovinces. Some overtures with a view to peace had been made after\r\nJena; but Napoleon finally refused to relax his pursuit unless the\r\nPrussians retired beyond the Vistula, and yielded up to him all the\r\nwestern parts of the kingdom, with their fortresses. Besides, he let\r\nit be known that Prussia must join him in a close alliance against\r\nRussia, with a view to checking her ambitious projects against Turkey;\r\nfor the Czar, resenting the Sultan's deposition of the hospodars of\r\nthe Danubian Principalities, an act suggested by the French, had sent\r\nan army across the River Pruth, even when the Porte timidly revoked\r\nits objectionable firman.[119] The Eastern Question having been thus\r\nreopened, Napoleon suggested a Franco-Prussian alliance so as to avert\r\na Russian conquest of the Balkan Peninsula. But now, as ever, his\r\nterms to Prussia were too exacting. The King deigned not to stoop to\r\nsuch humiliation, but resolved to stake his all on the courage of his\r\ntroops and the fidelity of the Czar.\r\n\r\nThe Russians, though delayed by their distrust of Haugwitz, and by\r\ntheir insensate war with Turkey, were now marching, 73,000 strong,\r\ninto Prussian Poland, but were too late to save the Silesian\r\nfortresses, most of which surrendered to the French. The fighting in\r\nthe open also went against the allies, though at Pultusk, a town north\r\nof Warsaw, the Russians claimed that the contest had been drawn in\r\ntheir favour.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year the armies went into winter-quarters. It was\r\nhigh time. The French were ill supplied for a winter campaign amid the\r\ndesolate wastes of Poland. Snow and rain, frosts and thaws had turned\r\nthe wretched tracks into muddy swamps, where men sank to their knees,\r\nhorses to their bellies, and carriages beyond their axles. The\r\ncarriage conveying Talleyrand was a whole night stuck fast, in spite\r\nof the efforts of ten horses to drag it out. The opinion of the\r\nsoldiery on Poland and the Poles is well expressed by that prince of\r\n_raconteurs_, Marbot: \"Weather frightful, victuals very scarce, no\r\nwine, beer detestable, water muddy, no bread, lodgings shared with\r\ncows and pigs. 'And they call this their country,' said our soldiers.\"\r\n\r\nYet Polish patriotism had been a mighty power in the world; and\r\nNapoleon, ever on the watch for the weak places of his foes, saw how\r\neffective a lever it might be. This had been his constant practice: he\r\nhad pitted Italians against Austrians, Copts against Mamelukes, Druses\r\nagainst Turks, Irish against English, South Germans against the\r\nHapsburgs and Hohenzollerns, and for the most part with success. But,\r\nexcept in the case of the Italian people and the South German princes,\r\nhe rarely, if ever, bestowed boons proportionate to the services\r\nrendered. It is very questionable whether he felt more warmly for\r\nIrish nationalists than for Copts and Druses.[120] Except in regard to\r\nhis Italian kindred, none of the nationalist aspirations that were to\r\nmould the history of the century touched a responsive chord in his\r\nnature. In this, as in other affairs of state, he held \"true policy\"\r\nto be \"nothing else than the calculation of combinations and chances.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in this spirit that he surveyed the Polish Question. Arising\r\nout of the partitions of that unhappy land by Russia, Austria, and\r\nPrussia, it had distracted the repose of Europe scarcely less than the\r\nFrench Revolution; and now the heir to the Revolution, after hewing\r\nhis way through the weak monarchies of Central Europe, was about to\r\nprobe this ulcer of Christendom. As usual, nothing had been done to\r\nforestall him. Czartoryski had begged Alexander to declare Russian\r\nPoland an autonomous kingdom united with Russia only by the golden\r\nlink of the crown, but this timely proposal was rejected;[121] and the\r\nCzar displayed the weakness of his judgment and the strength of his\r\nvanity by plunging into war with Turkey and Persia, at a time when\r\nPoland was opening her arms to the victor of a hundred fights. It was,\r\ntherefore, easy for Napoleon to surround Russia with foes; and, as\r\nwill shortly appear, he took steps to invigorate even the remote\r\nPersian Empire.\r\n\r\nBut, above all, he spurred on the Poles to take up arms. His\r\nencouragements were discreetly vague. True, he countenanced Polish\r\nproclamations, which spoke grandiloquently of national liberty; but\r\nproclamations he ever viewed as the _ballons d'essai_ of politics. He\r\nalso warned Murat not to promise the Poles too much: \"My greatness\r\ndoes not depend on the aid of a few thousand Poles. Let them show a\r\nfirm resolve to be independent: let them pledge themselves to support\r\nthe King that will be given to them, and then I will see what is to be\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\nThere were two reasons for this caution. His Marshals found no very\r\ngeneral disposition among the Poles to take up arms for France; and he\r\ndesired not to offend Austria by revolutionizing Galicia and her\r\ndistricts south and east of Warsaw. Already the Hapsburgs were\r\nnervously mustering their troops, and Napoleon had no wish to tempt\r\nfortune by warring against three Powers a thousand miles away from his\r\nown frontiers. He therefore calmed the Court of Vienna by promising\r\nthat he would discourage any rising in Austrian Poland, and he held\r\nforth the prospect of regaining Silesia. This tempting offer was made\r\nsecretly and conditionally; and evoked no expression of thanks, but\r\nrather a redoubling of precautions. Yet, despite the efforts of\r\nEngland and Russia, the Hapsburg ruler refused to join the allies: he\r\npreferred to play the waiting game which had ruined Prussia.[122]\r\n\r\nThe campaign was reopened amidst terrible weather by a daring move of\r\nBennigsen's Russians westwards, in the hope of saving Danzig and\r\nGraudenz from the French. At first a screen of forests well concealed\r\nhis advance. But, falling in with Bernadotte near the River Passarge,\r\nhis progress was checked and his design revealed. At once Napoleon\r\nprepared to march northwards and throw the Russians into the sea, a\r\nplan which in its turn was foiled by the seizure of a French despatch\r\nby Cossacks. Bennigsen, now aware of his danger, at once retreated\r\ntowards Königsberg, but at Eylau turned on his pursuers and fought the\r\nbloodiest battle fought in Europe since Malplaquet. The numbers on\r\nboth sides were probably about equal, numbering some 75,000 men, the\r\nRussians having a slight superiority in men and still more in\r\nartillery. Driven from Eylau on the night of February 7th after\r\nconfused fighting, the Muscovite withdrew to a strong position formed\r\nby an irregular line of hills, which he crowned with cannon.\r\n\r\nAs the dawn peered through the snow-laden clouds, guns began to deal\r\ndeath amongst the hostile masses, and heavy columns moved forward.\r\nDavoust, on the French right, began to push back the Russians on that\r\nside, whereupon Napoleon ordered Augereau's corps to complete the\r\nadvantage by driving in the enemy's centre. Gallantly the French\r\nadvanced. Their leading regiment, the 14th, had seized a hillock which\r\ncommanded the enemy's lines,[123] when, amidst a whirlwind of snow\r\nthat beat in their faces, a deadly storm of grape and canister almost\r\nannihilated the corps. Its shattered lines fell back, leaving the 14th\r\nto its fate. But a cloud of Cossacks now swept on the retiring\r\ncompanies, stabbing with their long spears; and it was a scanty band\r\nthat found safety in their former position. Russian cannon and cavalry\r\nalso stopped the advance of Davoust, and the fighting for a time\r\nresolved itself into confused but murderous charges at close quarters.\r\nAs if to increase the horrors of the scene, snowstorms again swept\r\nover the field, dazing the French and shrouding with friendly wings\r\nthe fierce charges of Cossacks. Yet the Grand Army fought on with\r\ndevoted heroism; and the chief, determined to snatch at victory,\r\nlaunched eighty squadrons of horse against the Russian centre.\r\nSweeping aside the Cossacks, and defying the cannon that riddled their\r\nfiles, they poured upon the first line of Russian infantry: for a time\r\nthey were stemmed, but, finding some weaker places, the cuirassiers\r\nburst through, only to be thrown back by the second line; and, when\r\nfuriously charged by Cossacks, they fell back in disorder. \"These\r\nRussians fight like bulls,\" said the French. The simile was just. Even\r\nwhile Murat was hacking at their centre a column of 4,000 Russian\r\ngrenadiers, detaching itself from their mangled line, marched straight\r\nforward on the village of Eylau. With the same blind courage that\r\nnerved Solmes' division at Steinkirk, they beat aside the French light\r\nhorse and foot, and were now threatening the cemetery where Napoleon\r\nand his staff were standing.\r\n\r\n    \"I never was so much struck with anything in my life,\" said\r\n    General Bertrand at St. Helena, \"as by the Emperor at Eylau when\r\n    he was almost trodden under foot by the Russian column. He kept\r\n    his ground as the Russians advanced, saying frequently, 'What\r\n    boldness.'\"\r\n\r\nBut, when all around him trembled, and Berthier ordered up the horses\r\nas if for retreat, he himself quietly signalled for his Guards. These\r\nsturdy troops, long fuming at their inaction, marched forward with a\r\nstern joy. As at Steinkirk the French Household Brigade disdained to\r\nfire on the bull-dogs, so now the Guards rushed on the Muscovites with\r\nthe cold steel. The shock was terrible; but the pent-up fury of the\r\nFrench carried all before it, and the grenadiers were wellnigh\r\ndestroyed. The battle might still have ended in a French victory; for\r\nDavoust was obstinately holding the village which he had seized in the\r\nmorning, and even threatened the rear of Bennigsen's centre. But when\r\nboth sides were wellnigh exhausted, the Prussian General Lestocq with\r\n8,000 men, urged on by the counsels of Scharnhorst, hurried up from\r\nthe side of Königsberg, marched straight on Davoust, and checked his\r\nforward movements. Ney followed Lestocq, but at so great a distance\r\nthat his arrival at nightfall served only to secure the French left.\r\n\r\nThus darkness closed over some 100,000 men, who wearily clung to their\r\nposts, and over snowy wastes where half that number lay dead, dying,\r\nor disabled. Well might Ney exclaim: \"What a massacre, and without any\r\nissue!\" Each side claimed the victory, and, as is usual in such cases,\r\nbegan industriously to minimize its own and to magnify the enemy's\r\nlosses. The truth seems to be that both sides had about 25,000 men\r\n_hors de combat_; but, as Bennigsen lacked tents, supplies, and above\r\nall, the dauntless courage of Napoleon, he speedily fell back, and\r\nthis enabled the Emperor to claim a decisive victory.[124]\r\n\r\nExhausted by this terrific strife, the combatants now relaxed their\r\nefforts for a brief space; but while Napoleon used the time of respite\r\nin hurrying up troops from all parts of his vast dominions, the allies\r\ndid little to improve their advantage. This inertness is all the more\r\nstrange as Prussia and Russia came to closer accord in the Treaty of\r\nBartenstein (April 26th, 1807).[125]\r\n\r\nThe two monarchs now recur to the generous scheme of a European peace,\r\nfor which the Czar and William Pitt had vainly struggled two years\r\nbefore. The present war is to be fought out to the end, not so as to\r\nhumble France and interfere in her internal concerns, but in order to\r\nassure to Europe the blessings of a solid peace based on the claims of\r\njustice and of national independence. France must be satisfied with\r\nreasonable boundaries, and Prussia be restored to the limits of 1805\r\nor their equivalent. Germany is to be freed from the dictation of the\r\nFrench, and become a \"constitutional federation,\" with a boundary\r\n\"parallel to the Rhine.\" Austria is to be asked to join the present\r\nleague, regaining Tyrol and the Mincio frontier. England and Sweden\r\nmust be rallied to the common cause. The allies will also take steps\r\nto cause Denmark to join the league. For the rest, the integrity of\r\nTurkey is to be maintained, and the future of Italy decided in concert\r\nwith Austria and England, the Kings of Sardinia and Naples being\r\nrestored. Even should Austria, England, and Sweden not join them, yet\r\nRussia and Prussia will continue the struggle and not lay down their\r\narms save by mutual consent.\r\n\r\nHad all the Powers threatened by Napoleon at once come forward and\r\nacted with vigour, these ends might, even now, have been attained. But\r\nAustria merely renewed her offers of mediation, a well-meaning but\r\nhopeless proposal. England, a prey to official incapacity, joined the\r\nleague, promised help in men and money, and did little or nothing\r\nexcept send fruitless expeditions to Alexandria and the Dardanelles\r\nwith the aim of forcing the Turks to a peace with Russia. In Sicily we\r\nheld our own against Joseph's generals, but had no men to spare for a\r\ndiversion against Marmont's forces in Dalmatia, which Alexander urged.\r\nStill less could we send from our own shores any force for the\r\neffective aid of Prussia. Though we had made peace with that Power,\r\nand ordinary prudence might have dictated the taking of steps to save\r\nthe coast fortresses, Danzig and Colberg, from the French besiegers,\r\nyet our efforts were limited to the despatch of a few cruisers to the\r\nformer stronghold. Even more urgent was the need of rescuing\r\nStralsund, the chief fortress of Swedish Pomerania. Such an expedition\r\nclearly offered great possibilities with the minimum of risk. From the\r\nIsle of Rügen Mortier's corps could be attacked; and when Stralsund\r\nwas freed, a dash on Stettin, then weakly held by the French, promised\r\nan easy success that would raise the whole of North Germany in\r\nNapoleon's rear.[126]\r\n\r\nBut arguments were thrown away upon the Grenville Ministry, which\r\nclung to its old plan of doing nothing and of doing it expensively.\r\nThe Foreign Secretary, Lord Howick, replied that the allies must not\r\nexpect any considerable aid from our land forces. Considering that the\r\nIncome or War Tax of 2s. in the £ had yielded close on £20,000,000,\r\nand that the army numbered 192,000 men (exclusive of those in India),\r\nthis declaration did not shed lustre on the Ministry of all the\r\nTalents. That bankrupt Cabinet, however, was dismissed by George III.\r\nin March, 1807, because it declined to waive the question of Catholic\r\nEmancipation, and its place was filled by the Duke of Portland, with\r\nCanning as Foreign Minister. Soon it was seen that Pitt's cloak had\r\nfallen on worthy shoulders, and a new vigour began to inspirit our\r\nforeign policy. Yet the bad results of frittering away our forces on\r\ndistant expeditions could not be wiped out at once. In fact, our\r\nmilitary expert, Lord Cathcart, reported that only some 12,000 men\r\ncould at present be spared for service in the Baltic; and, as it would\r\nbe beneath our dignity to send so small a force, it would be better to\r\nkeep it at home ready to menace any part of the French coast. As to\r\nStralsund, he thought that plan was more feasible, but that, even\r\nthere, the allies would not make head against Mortier's corps.[127]\r\n\r\nThis is a specimen of the reasoning that was fast rendering Britain\r\ncontemptible alike to friends and foes. It is not surprising that such\r\ntimorous selfishness should have at last moved the Czar to say to our\r\nenvoy: \"Act where you please, provided that you act at all.\"[128] In\r\nthe end the new Ministry did venture to act: it engaged to send 20,000\r\nmen to the succour of Stralsund; but, with the fatality that then\r\ndogged our steps, that decision was formed on June the 17th, three\r\ndays after the Coalition was shattered by the mighty blow of\r\nFriedland.\r\n\r\nIn striking contrast to the faint-hearted measures of the allies was\r\nthe timely energy of Napoleon in bringing up reinforcements. These\r\nwere drawn partly from Mortier's corps in Pomerania, now engaged in\r\nwatching the Swedes, who made a truce; partly from the Bavarians and\r\nSaxons; but mostly from French troops already in Central Germany,\r\ntheir places being taken by Italians, Spaniards, Swiss, and Dutch. In\r\nFrance a new levy of conscripts was ordered--the third since the\r\noutbreak of war with Prussia. The Turks were encouraged to press on\r\nthe war against Russia and England; and a mission was sent to the Shah\r\nof Persia to strengthen his arms against the Czar. To this last we\r\nwill now advert.\r\n\r\nFor some time past Napoleon had been coquetting with Persia, and an\r\nembassy from the Shah now came to the castle of Finkenstein, a\r\nbeautiful seat not far from the Vistula, where the Emperor spent the\r\nmonths of spring. A treaty was drawn up, and General Gardane was\r\ndeputed to draw closer the bonds of friendship with the Court of\r\nTeheran. The instructions secretly issued to this officer are of great\r\ninterest. He is ordered to proceed to Persia by way of Constantinople,\r\nto concert an alliance between Sultan and Shah, to redouble Persia's\r\nefforts against her \"natural enemy,\" Russia, and to examine the means\r\nof invading India. For this purpose a number of officers are sent with\r\nhim to examine the routes from Egypt or Syria to Delhi, as also to\r\nreport on the harbours in Persia with a view to a maritime expedition,\r\neither by way of Suez or the Cape of Good Hope. The Shah is to be\r\ninduced to form a corps of 12,000 men, drilled on the European model\r\nand armed with weapons sold by France. This force will attack the\r\nRussians in Georgia and serve later in an expedition to India. With a\r\nview to the sending of 20,000 French troops to India, Gardane is to\r\ncommunicate with the Mahratta princes and prepare for this enterprise\r\nby every possible means.\r\n\r\nWe may note here that Gardane proceeded to Persia and was urging on\r\nthe Shah to more active measures against Russia when the news of the\r\nTreaty of Tilsit diverted his efforts towards the east. At the close\r\nof the year, he reported to Napoleon that, for the march overland from\r\nSyria to the Ganges, Cyprus was an indispensable base of supplies: he\r\nrecommended the route Bir, Mardin, Teheran, Herat, Cabul, and\r\nPeshawar: forty to fifty thousand French troops would be needed, and\r\nthirty or forty thousand Persians should also be taken up. Nothing\r\ncame of these plans; but it is clear that, even when Napoleon was face\r\nto face with formidable foes on the Vistula, his thoughts still turned\r\nlongingly to the banks of the Ganges.[129]\r\n\r\nThe result of Napoleon's activity and the supineness of his foes were\r\nsoon apparent. Danzig surrendered to the French on May the 24th, and\r\nNeisse in Silesia a little later; and it was not till the besiegers of\r\nthese fortresses came up to swell the French host that Bennigsen\r\nopened the campaign. He was soon to rue the delay. His efforts to\r\ndrive the foe from the River Passarge were promptly foiled, and he\r\nretired in haste to his intrenched camp at Heilsberg. There, on June\r\nthe 10th, he turned fiercely at bay and dealt heavy losses to the\r\nFrench vanguard. In vain did Soult's corps struggle up towards the\r\nintrenchments; his men were mown down by grapeshot and musketry: in\r\nvain did Napoleon, who hurried up in the afternoon, launch the\r\nfusiliers of the Guard and a division of Lannes' corps. The Muscovites\r\nheld firm, and the day closed ominously for the French. It was Eylau\r\nover again on a small scale.\r\n\r\nBut Bennigsen was one of those commanders who, after fighting with\r\ngreat spirit, suffer a relapse. Despite the entreaties of his\r\ngenerals, he had retreated after Eylau; and now, after a day of\r\ninaction, his columns filed off towards Königsberg under cover of the\r\ndarkness. In excuse for this action it has been urged that he had but\r\ntwo days' supply of bread in the camp, and that a forward move of\r\nDavoust's corps round his right flank threatened to cut him off from\r\nhis base of supplies, Königsberg.[130]\r\n\r\nThe first excuse only exposes him to greater censure. The Russian\r\nhabit at that time usually was to live almost from hand to mouth; but\r\nthat a carefully-prepared position like that of Heilsberg should be\r\nleft without adequate supplies is unpardonable. On the two next days\r\nthe rival hosts marched northward, the one to seize, the other to\r\nsave, Königsberg. They were separated by the winding vale of the Alle.\r\nBut the course of this river favoured Napoleon as much as it hindered\r\nBennigsen. The Alle below Heilsberg makes a deep bend towards the\r\nnorth-east, then northwards again towards Friedland, where it comes\r\nwithin forty miles of Königsberg, but in its lower course flows\r\nnorth-east until it joins the Pregel.\r\n\r\nAn army marching from Heilsberg to the old Prussian capital by the\r\nright bank would therefore easily be outstripped by one that could\r\nfollow the chord of the arc instead of the irregular arc itself.\r\nNapoleon was in this fortunate position, while the Russians plodded\r\namid heavy rains over the semicircular route further to the east.\r\nTheir mistake in abandoning Heilsberg was now obvious. The Emperor\r\nhalted at Eylau on the 13th for news of the Prussians in front and of\r\nBennigsen on his right flank. Against the former he hurled his chief\r\nmasses under the lead of Murat in the hope of seizing Königsberg at\r\none blow.[131] But, foreseeing that the Russians would probably pass\r\nover the Alle at Friedland he despatched Lannes to Domnau to see\r\nwhether they had already crossed in force. Clearly, then, Napoleon did\r\nnot foresee what the morrow had in store for him: his aim was to drive\r\na solid wedge between Bennigsen and the defenders of Königsberg, to\r\nstorm that city first, and then to turn on Bennigsen. The claim of\r\nsome of Napoleon's admirers that he laid a trap for the Russians at\r\nFriedland, as he had done at Austerlitz, is therefore refuted by the\r\nEmperor's own orders.\r\n\r\nNone the less did Bennigsen walk into a trap, and one of his own\r\nchoosing. Anxious to thrust himself between Napoleon and the old\r\nPrussian capital, he crossed the river at Friedland and sought to\r\nstrengthen his position on the left bank by driving Lannes' vanguard\r\nback on Domnau, by throwing three bridges over the stream, and by\r\ncrowning the hills on the right bank with a formidable artillery. But\r\nhe had to deal with a tough and daring opponent. Throughout the winter\r\nLannes had been a prey to ill-health and resentment at his chief's\r\nreal or fancied injustice: but the heats of summer re-awakened his\r\nthirst for glory and restored him to his wonted vigour. Calling up the\r\nSaxon horse, Grouchy's dragoons, and Oudinot's grenadiers, he held his\r\nground through the brief hours of darkness. Before dawn he posted his\r\n10,000 troops among the woods and on the plateau of Posthenen that\r\nlies to the west of Friedland and strove to stop the march of 40,000\r\nRussians. After four hours of fighting, his men were about to be\r\nthrust back, when the divisions of Verdier and Dupas--the latter from\r\nMortier's corps--shared the burden of the fight until the sun was at\r\nits zenith. When once more the fight was doubtful, the dense columns\r\nof Ney and Victor were to be seen, and by desperate efforts the French\r\nvanguard held its ground until this welcome aid arrived.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, having received Lannes' urgent appeals for help, now rode up\r\nin hot haste, and in response to the cheers of his weary troops\r\nrepeatedly exclaimed: \"Today is a lucky day, the anniversary of\r\nMarengo.\" Their ardour was excited to the highest pitch, Oudinot\r\nsaluting his chief with the words: \"Quick, sire! my grenadiers can\r\nhold no longer: but give me reinforcements and I'll pitch the Russians\r\ninto the river.\"[132] The Emperor cautiously gave them pause: the\r\nfresh troops marched to the front and formed the first line, those who\r\nhad fought for nine hours now forming the supports. Ney held the post\r\nof honour in the woods on the right flank, nearly above Friedland;\r\nbehind him was the corps of Bernadotte, which, since the disabling of\r\nthat Marshal by a wound had been led by General Victor: there too were\r\nthe dragoons of Latour-Maubourg, and the imposing masses of the Guard.\r\nIn the centre, but bending in towards the rear, stood the remnant of\r\nLannes' indomitable corps, now condemned for a time to comparative\r\ninactivity; and defensive tactics were also enjoined on\r\nMortier and Grouchy on the left wing, until Ney and Victor should\r\ndecide the fortunes of the second fight. The Russians, as if bent on\r\nfavouring Napoleon's design, continued to deploy in front of\r\nFriedland, keeping up the while a desultory fight; and Bennigsen,\r\nanxious now about his communications with Königsberg, detached 6,000\r\nmen down the right bank of the river towards Wehlau. Only 46,000 men\r\nwere thus left to defend Friedland against a force that now numbered\r\n80,000: yet no works were thrown up to guard the bridges--and this\r\nafter the arrival of Napoleon with strong reinforcements was known by\r\nthe excitement along the enemy's front.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF FRIEDLAND]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as late as 3 p.m., Napoleon was in doubt whether he\r\nshould not await the arrival of Murat. At his instructions, Berthier\r\nordered that Marshal to leave Soult at Königsberg and hurry back with\r\nDavoust and the cavalry towards Friedland: \"If I perceive at the\r\nbeginning of this fight that the enemy is in too great force, I might\r\nbe content with cannonading to-day and awaiting your arrival.\" But a\r\nlittle later the Emperor decides for instant attack. The omens are all\r\nfavourable. If driven back the Russians will fight with their backs to\r\na deep river. Besides, their position is cut in twain by a mill-stream\r\nwhich flows in a gulley, and near the town is dammed up so as to form\r\na small lake. Below this lies Friedland in a deep bend of the river\r\nitself. Into this _cul-de-sac_ he will drive the Russian left, and\r\nfling their broken lines into the lake and river.\r\n\r\nAt five o'clock a salvo of twenty guns opened the second and greater\r\nbattle of Friedland. To rush on the Muscovite van and clear it from\r\nthe wood of Sortlack was for Ney's leading division the work of a\r\nmoment; but on reaching the open ground their ranks were ploughed by\r\nthe shot of the Russian guns ranged on the hills beyond the river.\r\nStaggered by this fire, the division was wavering, when the Russian\r\nGuards and their choicest squadrons of horse charged home with deadly\r\neffect. But Ney's second division, led by the gallant Dupont, hurried\r\nup to restore the balance, while Latour-Maubourg's dragoons fell on\r\nthe enemy's horsemen and drove them pell-mell towards Friedland.\r\n\r\nThe Russian artillery fared little better: Napoleon directed Sénarmont\r\nwith thirty-six guns to take it in flank and it was soon overpowered.\r\nFreed now from the Russian grapeshot and sabres, Ney held on his\r\ncourse like a torrent that masters a dam, reached the upper part of\r\nthe lake, and threw the bewildered foe into its waters or into the\r\ntown. Friedland was now a death-trap: huddled together, plied by\r\nshell, shot and bayonet, the Russians fought from street to street\r\nwith the energy of despair, but little by little were driven back on\r\nthe bridges. No help was to be found there; for Sénarmont, bringing up\r\nhis guns, swept the bridges with a terrific fire: when part of the\r\nRussian left and centre had fled across, they burst into flames, a\r\nsignal that warned their comrades further north of their coming doom.\r\nOn that side, too, a general advance of the French drove the enemy\r\nback towards the steep banks of the river. But on those open plains\r\nthe devotion and prowess of the Muscovite cavalry bore ampler fruit:\r\ncharging the foe while in the full swing of victory, these gallant\r\nriders gave time for the infantry to attempt the dangers of a deep\r\nford: hundreds were drowned, but others, along with most of the guns,\r\nstole away in the darkness down the left bank of the river.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow Bennigsen's army was a mass of fugitives straggling\r\ntowards the Pregel and fighting with one another for a chance to cross\r\nits long narrow bridge. Even on the other side they halted not, but\r\nwandered on towards the Niemen, no longer an army but an armed mob. On\r\nits banks they were joined by the defenders of Königsberg, who after a\r\nstout stand cut their way through Soult's lines and made for Tilsit.\r\nThere, behind the broad stream of the Niemen, the fugitives found\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nIt will always be a mystery why Bennigsen held on to Friedland after\r\nFrench reinforcements arrived; and the feeling of wonder and\r\nexasperation finds expression in the report of our envoy, Lord\r\nHutchinson, founded on the information of two British officers who\r\nwere at the Russian headquarters:\r\n\r\n    \"Many of the circumstances attending the Battle of Friedland are\r\n    unexampled in the annals of war. We crossed the River Alle, not\r\n    knowing whether we had to contend with a corps or the whole French\r\n    army. From the commencement of the battle it was manifest that we\r\n    had a great deal to lose and probably little to gain: ... General\r\n    Bennigsen would, I believe, have retired early in the day from\r\n    ground which he ought never to have occupied; but the corps in our\r\n    front made so vigorous a resistance that, though occasionally we\r\n    gained a little ground, yet we were never able to drive them from\r\n    the woods or the village of Heinrichsdorf.\"[133]\r\n\r\nThis evidence shows the transcendent services of Lannes, Oudinot, and\r\nGrouchy in the early part of the day; and it is clear that, as at\r\nJena, no great battle would have been fought at all but for the valour\r\nand tenacity with which Lannes clung to the foe until Napoleon came\r\nup.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTILSIT\r\n\r\n\r\nEven now matters were not hopeless for the allies. Crowds of\r\nstragglers rejoined the colours at Tilsit, and Tartar reinforcements\r\nwere near at hand. The gallant Gneisenau was still holding out bravely\r\nat Kolberg against Brune's divisions; and two of the Silesian\r\nfortresses had not yet surrendered. Moreover, Austria seemed about to\r\ndeclare against Napoleon, and there were hopes that before long\r\nEngland would do something. But, above all, since the war was for\r\nPrussia solely an affair of honour,[134] it deeply concerned\r\nAlexander's good name not to desert an ally to whom he was now pledged\r\nby all the claims of chivalry until satisfactory terms could be\r\ngained.\r\n\r\nBut Alexander's nature had not as yet been strengthened by misfortune\r\nand religious convictions: it was a sunny background of flickering\r\nenthusiasms, flecked now and again by shadows of eastern cunning or\r\ndarkened by warlike ambitions--a nature in which the sentimentalism of\r\nRousseau and the passions of a Boyar alternately gained the mastery.\r\nNo realism is more crude than that of the disillusionized idealist;\r\nand for months the young Czar had seen his dream of a free and happy\r\nEurope fade away amidst the smoke of Napoleon's guns and the mists of\r\nEnglish muddling. At first he blenched not even at the news of\r\nFriedland. In an interview with our ambassador, Lord Gower, on June\r\nthe 17th, he bitterly upbraided him with our inactivity in the Baltic\r\nand the Mediterranean, and the non-fulfilment of our promise of a\r\nloan; as for himself, \"he would never stoop to Bonaparte: he would\r\nrather retire to Kazan or even to Tobolsk.\" But five days later,\r\nacting under pressure from his despairing generals, some of whom\r\nreminded him of his father's fate, he arranged an armistice with the\r\nconqueror.[135] Five days only were allowed in which Prussia might\r\ndecide to follow his example or proceed with the war alone. She\r\naccepted the inevitable on the following day.\r\n\r\nThe international situation was now strangely like that which followed\r\nimmediately upon the battle of Austerlitz. Then it was Prussia, now it\r\nwas Austria, that played the part of the cautious friend at the very\r\ntime when the beaten allies were meditating surrender. For some time\r\npast the Court of Vienna had been offering its services for mediation:\r\nthey were well received at London, with open disappointment by\r\nPrussia, and with ill-concealed annoyance by Napoleon. As at the time\r\nwhen Haugwitz came to him to dictate Prussia's terms, so now the\r\nEmperor kept the Austrian envoy waiting without an answer, until the\r\nblow of Friedland was dealt.[136] Even then Austria seemed about to\r\nenter the lists, when news arrived of the conclusion of the armistice\r\nat Tilsit. This enabled her to sheathe her sword with no loss of\r\nhonour; but, as was the case with Prussia at the close of 1805, her\r\nconduct was seen to be timid and time-serving; and it merited the\r\nsecret rebuke of Canning that she \"was (as usual) just ten days too\r\nlate in her determination, or the world might have been saved.\"[137]\r\n\r\nWhether Austria had been beguiled by the recent diplomatic caresses of\r\nNapoleon may well be doubted; for they were obviously aimed at keeping\r\nher quiet until he had settled scores with Prussia and Russia. His\r\nadvances only began on the eve of the last war, and the sharpness of\r\nthe transition from threats to endearments could not be smoothed over\r\neven by Talleyrand's finesse.[138] When the slaughter at Eylau placed\r\nhim in peril, he again bade Talleyrand soothe the Austrian envoy with\r\nassurances that, if his master was anxious to maintain the integrity\r\nof Turkey, France would maintain it; or if he desired to share in an\r\neventual partition, France would also arrange that to his liking.[139]\r\nBut as the prospects for the campaign improved, Napoleon's tone\r\nhardened. On March the 14th he states that he has enough men to keep\r\nAustria quiet and to \"get rid of the Russians in a month.\" And now he\r\nlooks on an alliance with the Hapsburgs merely as giving a short time\r\nof quiet, whereas an alliance with Russia would be \"very\r\nadvantageous.\"[140] He had also felt the value of alliance with\r\nPrussia, as his repeated overtures during the campaign testify; but\r\nwhen Frederick William persistently rejected all accommodation with\r\nthe man who had so deeply outraged his kingly honour, he turned\r\nfinally to Alexander.\r\n\r\nThe Czar was made of more pliable stuff. Moreover, he now cherished\r\none sentiment that brought him into sympathy with Napoleon, namely,\r\nhatred of England. He certainly had grave cause for complaint. We had\r\ndone nothing to help the allies in the Polish campaign except to send\r\na few cruisers and 60,000 muskets, which last did not reach the\r\nSwedish and Russian ports until the war was over. True, we had gone\r\nout of our way to attack Constantinople at his request; but that\r\nattack had failed; and our attitude towards his Turkish policy was one\r\nof veiled suspicion, varied with moral lectures.[141] As for the loan\r\nof five millions sterling which the Czar had asked us to guarantee, we\r\nhad put him off, our envoy finally reminding him that it had been of\r\nthe first importance to help Austria to move. Worst of all, our\r\ncruisers had seized some Russian merchantmen coming out of French\r\nports, and despite protests from St. Petersburg the legality of that\r\nseizure was maintained. Thus, in a war which concerned our very\r\nexistence we had not rendered him a single practical service, and yet\r\nstrained the principles of maritime law at the expense of Russian\r\ncommerce.[142]\r\n\r\nOver against our policy of blundering delay there was that of\r\nNapoleon, prompt, keen, and ever victorious. The whole war had arisen\r\nout of the conflict of these two Powers; and Napoleon had never ceased\r\nto declare that it was essentially a struggle between England and the\r\nContinent. After Eylau Alexander was proof against these arguments;\r\nbut now the triumphant energy of Napoleon and the stolid apathy of\r\nEngland brought about a quite bewildering change in Russian policy.\r\nDelicate advances having been made by the two Emperors, an interview\r\nwas arranged to take place on a raft moored in the middle of the River\r\nNiemen (June 25th).\r\n\r\n\"I hate the English as much as you do, and I will second you in all\r\nyour actions against them.\" Such are said to have been the words with\r\nwhich Alexander greeted Napoleon as they stepped on to the raft.\r\nWhereupon the conqueror replied: \"In that case all can be arranged and\r\npeace is made.\"[143] As the two Emperors were unaccompanied at that\r\nfirst interview, it is difficult to see on what evidence this story\r\nrests. It is most unlikely that either Emperor would divulge the\r\nremarks of the other on that occasion; and the words attributed to\r\nAlexander seem highly impolitic. For what was his position at this\r\ntime? He was striving to make the best of a bad case against an\r\nopponent whose genius he secretly feared. Besides, we know for certain\r\nthat he was most anxious to postpone his rupture with England for some\r\nmonths.[144] All desire for an immediate break was on Napoleon's side.\r\n\r\nWe can therefore only guess at what transpired, from the vague\r\ndescriptions of the two men themselves. They are characteristic\r\nenough: \"I never had more prejudices against anyone than against\r\n_him_,\" said Alexander afterwards; \"but, after three-quarters of an\r\nhour of conversation, they all disappeared like a dream\"; and later he\r\nexclaimed: \"Would that I had seen him sooner: the veil is torn aside\r\nand the time of error is past.\" As for Napoleon, he wrote to\r\nJosephine: \"I have just seen the Emperor Alexander: I have been very\r\npleased with him: he is a very handsome, good, and young Emperor: he\r\nhas an intellect above what is commonly attributed to him.\"[145] The\r\ntone of these remarks strikes the keynote of all the conversations\r\nthat followed. At the next day's conference, also held in the\r\nsumptuous pavilion erected on the raft, the King of Prussia was\r\npresent; but towards him Napoleon's demeanour was cold and\r\nthreatening. He upbraided him with the war, lectured him on the duty\r\nof a king to his people, and bade him dismiss Hardenberg. Frederick\r\nWilliam listened for the most part in silence; his nature was too\r\nstiff and straightforward to practise any Byzantine arts; but when his\r\ntrusty Minister was attacked, he protested that he should not know how\r\nto replace him. Napoleon had foreseen the plea and at once named three\r\nmen who would give better advice. Among them was the staunch patriot\r\nStein!\r\n\r\nFrom the ensuing conferences the King was almost wholly excluded. They\r\nwere held in a part of the town of Tilsit which was neutralized for\r\nthat purpose, as also for the guards and diplomatists of the three\r\nsovereigns. There, too, lived the two Emperors in closest intercourse,\r\nwhile on most days the Prussian King rode over from a neighbouring\r\nvillage to figure as a sad, reproachful guest at the rides, parades,\r\nand dinners that cemented the new Franco-Russian alliance. Yet, amid\r\nall the melodious raptures of Alexander over Napoleon's newly\r\ndiscovered virtues, it is easy to detect the clinging ground-tone of\r\nMuscovite ambition. An event had occurred which excited the hopes of\r\nboth Emperors. At the close of May, the Sultan Selim was violently\r\ndeposed by the Janissaries who clamoured for more vigorous measures\r\nagainst the Russians. Never did news come more opportunely for\r\nNapoleon than this, which reached him at Tilsit on, or before, June\r\nthe 24th. He is said to have exclaimed to the Czar with a flash of\r\ndramatic fatalism: \"It is a decree of Providence which tells me that\r\nthe Turkish Empire can no longer exist.\"[146]\r\n\r\nCertain it is that the most potent spell exerted by the great\r\nconqueror over his rival was a guarded invitation to share in some\r\nfuture partition of the Turkish Empire. That scheme had fascinated\r\nNapoleon ever since the year 1797, when he gazed on the Adriatic.\r\nThough laid aside for a time in 1806, when he roused the Turks against\r\nRussia, it was never lost sight of; and now, on the basis of a common\r\nhatred of England and a common desire to secure the spoils of the\r\nOttoman Power, the stately fabric of the Franco-Russian alliance was\r\nreared.\r\n\r\nOn his side, Alexander required some assurance that Poland should not\r\nbe reconstituted in its integrity--a change that would tear from\r\nRussia the huge districts stretching almost up to Riga, Smolensk, and\r\nKiev, which were still Polish in sympathy. Here Napoleon reassured\r\nhim, at least in part. He would not re-create the great kingdom of\r\nPoland: he would merely carve out from Prussia the greater part of her\r\nPolish possessions.\r\n\r\nThese two important questions being settled, it only remained for the\r\nCzar to plead for the King of Prussia, to acknowledge Napoleon's\r\ndomination as Emperor of the West, while he himself, as autocrat of\r\nthe East, secured a better western boundary for Russia. At first he\r\nstrove to gain for Frederick William the restoration of several of his\r\nlands west of the Elbe. This championship was not wholly\r\ndisinterested; for it is now known that the Czar had set his heart on\r\na great part of Prussian Poland.\r\n\r\nIn truth, he was a sufficiently good disciple of the French\r\nrevolutionists to plead very cogently his claims to a \"natural\r\nfrontier.\" He disliked a \"dry frontier\": he must have a riverine\r\nboundary: in fact, he claimed the banks of the Lower Niemen, and,\r\nfurther south, the course of the rivers Wavre, Narew and Bug. To this\r\nclaim he had perhaps been encouraged by some alluring words of\r\nNapoleon that thenceforth the Vistula must be the boundary of their\r\nempires. But his ally was now determined to keep Russia away from the\r\nold Polish capital; and in strangely prophetic words he pointed out\r\nthat the Czar's claims would bring the Russian eagles within sight of\r\nWarsaw, which would be too clear a sign that that city was destined to\r\npass under the Russian rule.[147] Divining also that Alexander's plea\r\nfor the restoration by France of some of Prussia's western lands was\r\nlinked with a plan which would give Russia some of her eastern\r\ndistricts,[148] Napoleon resolved to press hard on Prussia from the\r\nwest. While handing over to the Czar only the small district around\r\nBialystock, he remorselessly thrust Prussia to the east of the Elbe.\r\n\r\nFrom this neither the arguments of the Czar nor the entreaties of\r\nQueen Louisa availed to move him. And yet, in the fond hope that her\r\ntears might win back Magdeburg, that noble bulwark of North German\r\nindependence, the forlorn Queen came to Tilsit to crave this boon\r\n(July 6th). It was a terrible ordeal to do this from the man who had\r\nrepeatedly insulted her in his official journals, figuring her, first\r\nas a mailed Amazon galloping at the head of her regiment, and finally\r\nbreathing forth scandals on her spotless reputation.\r\n\r\nYet, for the sake of her husband and her people, she braced herself up\r\nto the effort of treating him as a gentleman and appealing to his\r\ngenerosity. If she was able to conceal her loathing, this was scarcely\r\nso with her devoted lady in waiting, the Countess von Voss, who has\r\nleft us an acrid account of Napoleon's visit to the Queen at the\r\nmiller's house at Tilsit.[149]\r\n\r\n    \"He is excessively ugly, with a fat swollen sallow face, very\r\n    corpulent, besides short and entirely without figure. His great\r\n    eyes roll gloomily around; the expression of his features is\r\n    severe; he looks like the incarnation of fate: only his mouth is\r\n    well shaped, and his teeth are good. He was extremely polite,\r\n    talked to the Queen a long time alone.... Again, after dinner, he\r\n    had a long conversation with the Queen, who also seemed pretty\r\n    well satisfied with the result.\"[150]\r\n\r\n\r\nQueen Louisa's verdict about his appearance was more favourable; she\r\nadmired his head \"as that of a Cæsar.\" With winsome boldness inspired\r\nby patriotism, she begged for Magdeburg. Taken aback by her beauty and\r\nfrankness, Napoleon had recourse to compliments about her dress. \"Are\r\nwe to talk about fashion, at such a time?\" was her reply. Again she\r\npleaded, and again he fell back on vapidities. Nevertheless, her\r\nappeals to his generosity seemed to be thawing his statecraft, when\r\nthe entrance of that unlucky man, her husband, gave the conversation a\r\ncolder tone. The dinner, however, passed cheerfully enough; and,\r\naccording to French accounts, Napoleon graced the conclusion of\r\ndessert by offering her a rose. Her woman's wit flew to the utterance:\r\n\"May I consider it a token of friendship, and that you grant my\r\nrequest for Magdeburg?\" But he was on his guard, parried her onset\r\nwith a general remark as to the way in which such civilities should be\r\ntaken, and turned the conversation. Then, as if he feared the result\r\nof a second interview, he hastened to end matters with the Prussian\r\nnegotiators.[151]\r\n\r\nHe thus described the interview in a letter to Josephine:\r\n\r\n    \"I have had to be on my guard against her efforts to oblige me to\r\n    some concessions for her husband; but I have been gallant, and\r\n    have held to my policy.\"\r\n\r\nThis was only too clear on the following day, when the Queen again\r\ndined with the sovereigns.\r\n\r\n    \"Napoleon,\" says the Countess von Voss, \"seemed malicious and\r\n    spiteful, and the conversation was brief and constrained. After\r\n    dinner the Queen again conversed apart with him. On taking leave\r\n    she said to him that she went away feeling it deeply that he\r\n    should have deceived her. My poor Queen: she is quite in despair.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen conducted to her carriage by Talleyrand and Duroc, she sank down\r\novercome by emotion. Yet, amid her tears and humiliation, the old\r\nPrussian pride had flashed forth in one of her replies as the rainbow\r\namidst the rain-storm. When Napoleon expressed his surprise that she\r\nshould have dared to make war on him with means so utterly inadequate,\r\nshe at once retorted: \"Sire, I must confess to Your Majesty, the glory\r\nof Frederick the Great had misled us as to our real strength\"--a\r\nretort which justly won the praise of that fastidious connoisseur,\r\nTalleyrand, for its reminder of Prussia's former greatness and the\r\ntransitoriness of all human grandeur.[152]\r\n\r\nOn that same day (July 7th) the Treaty of Tilsit was signed. Its terms\r\nmay be thus summarized. Out of regard for the Emperor of Russia,\r\nNapoleon consented to restore to the King of Prussia the province of\r\nSilesia, and the old Prussian lands between the Elbe and Niemen. But\r\nthe Polish lands seized by Prussia in the second and third partitions\r\nwere (with the exception of the Bialystock district, now gained by\r\nRussia) to form a new State called the Duchy of Warsaw. Of this duchy\r\nthe King of Saxony was constituted ruler. Danzig, once a Polish city,\r\nwas now declared a free city under the protection of the Kings of\r\nPrussia and Saxony, but the retention there of a French garrison until\r\nthe peace made it practically a French fortress. Saxe-Coburg,\r\nOldenburg, and Mecklenburg-Schwerin were restored to their dukes, but\r\nthe two last were to be held by French troops until England made peace\r\nwith France. With this aim in view, Napoleon accepted Alexander's\r\nmediation for the conclusion of a treaty of peace with England,\r\nprovided that she accepted that mediation within one month of the\r\nratification of the present treaty.\r\n\r\nOn his side, the Czar now recognized the recent changes in Naples,\r\nHolland, and Germany; among the last of these was the creation of the\r\nKingdom of Westphalia for Jerome Bonaparte out of the Prussian lands\r\nwest of the Elbe, the Duchy of Brunswick, and the Electorate of\r\nHesse-Cassel. Holland gained East Frisia at the expense of Prussia. As\r\nregards Turkey, the Czar pledged himself to cease hostilities at once,\r\nto accept the mediation of Napoleon in the present dispute, and to\r\nwithdraw Russian troops from the Danubian Provinces as soon as peace\r\nwas concluded with the Sublime Porte. Finally, the two Emperors\r\nmutually guaranteed the integrity of their possessions and placed\r\ntheir ceremonial and diplomatic relations on a footing of complete\r\nequality.\r\n\r\nSuch were the published articles of the Treaty of Tilsit. Even if this\r\nhad been all, the European system would have sustained the severest\r\nblow since the Thirty Years' War. The Prussian monarchy was suddenly\r\nbereft of half its population, and now figured on the map as a\r\ndisjointed land, scarcely larger than the possessions of the King of\r\nSaxony, and less defensible than Jerome Bonaparte's Kingdom of\r\nWestphalia; while the Confederation of the Rhine, soon to be\r\naggrandized by the accession of Mecklenburg and Oldenburg, seemed to\r\ndoom the House of Hohenzollern to lasting insignificance.[153]\r\n\r\nBut the published treaty was by no means all. There were also secret\r\narticles, the chief of which were that the Cattaro district--to the\r\nwest of Montenegro--and the Ionian Islands should go to France, and\r\nthat the Czar would recognize Joseph Bonaparte as King of Sicily when\r\nFerdinand of Naples should have received \"an indemnity such as the\r\nBalearic Isles, or Crete, or their equivalent.\" Also, if Hanover\r\nshould eventually be annexed to the Kingdom of Westphalia, a\r\nWestphalian district with a population of from three to four hundred\r\nthousand souls would be retroceded to Prussia. Finally, the chiefs of\r\nthe Houses of Orange-Nassau, Hesse-Cassel, and Brunswick were to\r\nreceive pensions from Murat and Jerome Bonaparte, who dispossessed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMost important of all was the secret treaty of alliance with Russia,\r\nalso signed on July 7th, whereby the two Emperors bound themselves to\r\nmake common cause in any war that either of them might undertake\r\nagainst any European Power, employing, if need be, the whole of their\r\nrespective forces. Again, if England did not accept the Czar's\r\nmediation, or if she did not, by the 1st of December, 1807, recognize\r\nthe perfect equality of all flags at sea, and restore her conquests\r\nmade from France and her allies since 1805, then Russia would make war\r\non her. In that case, the present allies will \"summon the three Courts\r\nof Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Lisbon to close their ports against the\r\nEnglish and declare war against England. If any one of the three\r\nCourts refuse, it shall be treated as an enemy by the high contracting\r\nparties, and if Sweden refuse, _Denmark shall be compelled to declare\r\nwar on her_.\" Pressure would also be put on Austria to follow the same\r\ncourse. But if England made peace betimes, she might recover Hanover,\r\non restoring her conquests in the French, Spanish, and Dutch colonies.\r\nSimilarly, if Turkey refused the mediation of Napoleon, he would in\r\nthat case help Russia to drive the Turks from Europe--\"the city of\r\nConstantinople and the province of Roumelia alone excepted.\"[154]\r\n\r\nThe naming of the city of Constantinople, which is in Roumelia,\r\nbetokens a superfluity of prudence. But it helps to confirm the\r\nstatement of Napoleon's secretary, M. Méneval, that the future of that\r\ncity led to a decided difference of opinion between the Emperors.\r\nAfter one of their discussions, Napoleon stayed poring over a map, and\r\nfinally exclaimed, \"Constantinople! Never! It is the empire of the\r\nworld.\" Doubtless it was on this subject that Alexander cherished some\r\nsecret annoyance. Certain it is that, despite all his professions of\r\ndevotion to Napoleon, he went back to St. Petersburg ill at ease and\r\npossessed with a certain awe of the conqueror. For what had he gained?\r\nHe received a small slice of Prussian Poland, and the prospect of\r\naggrandizement on the side of Turkey and Sweden, Finland being pointed\r\nout as an easy prey. For these future gains he was to close his ports\r\nto England and see his commerce, his navy, and his seaboard suffer. It\r\nis not surprising that before leaving Tilsit he remarked to Frederick\r\nWilliam that \"the most onerous condition imposed by Napoleon was\r\ncommon to Russia and Prussia.\"[155]\r\n\r\nThis refers to the compulsion put upon them to join Napoleon's\r\nContinental System. In the treaty signed with Prussia on July 9th,\r\nNapoleon not only wrested away half her lands, but required the\r\nimmediate closing of all her ports to British vessels. We may also\r\nnote here that, by the extraordinary negligence of the Prussian\r\nnegotiator, Marshal Kalckreuth, the subsequent convention as to the\r\nevacuation of Prussia by the French troops left open a loophole for\r\nits indefinite occupation. Each province or district was to be\r\nevacuated when the French requisitions had been satisfied.[156] The\r\nexaction of impossible sums would therefore enable the conquerors,\r\nquite legally, to keep their locust swarms in that miserable land. And\r\nthat was the policy pursued for sixteen months.\r\n\r\nWhy this refinement of cruelty to his former ally? Why not have\r\nannexed Prussia outright? Probably there were two reasons against\r\nannexation: first, that his army could live on her in a way that would\r\nnot be possible with his own subjects or allies; second, that the army\r\nof occupation would serve as a guarantee both for Russia's good faith\r\nand for the absolute exclusion of British goods from Prussia.[157]\r\nThis had long been his aim. He now attained it, but only by war that\r\nbequeathed a legacy of war, and a peace that was no peace.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's behaviour at Tilsit has generally been regarded, at least\r\nin England, as prompted by an insane lust of power; and the treaty has\r\nbeen judged as if its aim was the domination of the Continent. But\r\nanother explanation, though less sweeping and attractive, seems more\r\nconsonant with the facts of the case.\r\n\r\nHe hoped that, before so mighty a confederacy as was framed at Tilsit,\r\nEngland would bend the knee, give up not only her maritime claims but\r\nher colonial conquests, and humbly take rank with Powers that had\r\nlived their day. The conqueror who had thrice crumpled up the Hapsburg\r\nStates, and shattered Prussia in a day, might well believe that the\r\nmen of Downing Street, expert only in missing opportunities and\r\nexasperating their friends, would not dare to defy the forces of\r\nunited Europe, but would bow before his prowess and grant peace to a\r\nweary world. In his letter of July 6th, 1807, to the Czar, he advised\r\nthe postponement of the final summons to the British Government,\r\nbecause it would \"give five months in which the first exasperation\r\nwill die down in England, and she will have time to understand the\r\nimmense consequences that would result from so imprudent a struggle.\"\r\nNeither Napoleon nor Alexander was deaf to generous aspirations. They\r\nboth desired peace, so that their empires might expand and\r\nconsolidate. Above all, France was weary of war; and by peace the\r\naverage Frenchman meant, not respite from Continental strifes that\r\nyielded a surfeit of barren glories, but peace with England. The words\r\nof Lucchesini, the former Prussian ambassador in Paris, on this\r\nsubject are worth quoting:\r\n\r\n    \"The war with England was at bottom the only one in which the\r\n    French public took much interest, since the evils it inflicted on\r\n    France were felt every moment: nothing was spoken of so decidedly\r\n    among all classes of the people as the wish to have done with that\r\n    war; and when one spoke of peace at Paris, one always meant peace\r\n    with England: peace with the others was as indifferent to the\r\n    public as the victories or the conquests of Bonaparte.\"[158]\r\n\r\nIf the French middle classes longed for a maritime peace so that\r\ncoffee and sugar might become reasonably cheap, how much more would\r\ntheir ruler, whose heart was set on colonies and a realm in the\r\nOrient? In Poland he had cheered his troops with the thought that they\r\nwere winning back the French colonial empire; and, as we have seen, he\r\nwas even then preparing the ground in Persia for a future invasion of\r\nIndia. These plans could only be carried out after a time of peace\r\nthat should rehabilitate the French navy. Humanitarian sentiment,\r\npatriotism, and even the promptings of a wider ambition, therefore\r\nbade him strive for a general pacification, such as he seemed to have\r\nassured at Tilsit.\r\n\r\nBut the means which he adopted were just those that were destined to\r\ndefeat this aim. Where he sought to intimidate, he only aroused a more\r\nstubborn resistance: where he should have allayed national fears, he\r\nredoubled them. He did not understand our people: he saw not that,\r\nbehind our official sluggishness and muddling, there was a quenchless\r\nnational vitality, which, if directed by a genius, could defy a\r\nworld-wide combination. If, instead of making secret compacts with the\r\nCzar and trampling on Prussia; if, instead of intriguing with the\r\nSultan and the Shah, and thus reawakening our fears respecting Egypt\r\nand India, he had called a Congress and submitted all the present\r\ndisputes to general discussion, there is reason to think that Great\r\nBritain would have received his overtures. George III.'s Ministers had\r\nfavoured the proposal of a Congress when put forward by Austria in the\r\nspring;[159] and they would doubtless have welcomed it from Napoleon\r\nafter Friedland, had they not known of far-reaching plans which\r\nrendered peace more risky than open war. This great genius had, in\r\nfact, one fatal defect; he had little faith except in outward\r\ncompulsion; and his superabundant energy of menace against England\r\nblighted the hopes of peace which he undoubtedly cherished.\r\n\r\nLong before Alexander's offer of mediation was forwarded to London,\r\nour Ministers had taken a sudden and desperate resolution. They\r\ndetermined to compel Denmark to join England and Sweden, and to hold\r\nthe fleet at Copenhagen as a gauge of Danish fidelity.\r\n\r\nThat momentous resolve was formed on or just before July the 16th, in\r\nconsequence of news that had arrived from Memel and Tilsit. The exact\r\npurport of that news, and the manner of its acquisition, have been one\r\nof the puzzles of modern history. But the following facts seem to\r\nfurnish a solution. Our Foreign Office Records show that our agent at\r\nTilsit, Mr. Mackenzie, who was on confidential terms with General\r\nBennigsen, left post haste for England immediately after the first\r\nimperial interview; and the news which he brought, together with\r\nreports of the threatening moves of the French on Holstein, clinched\r\nthe determination of our Government to checkmate the Franco-Russian\r\naims by bringing strong pressure to bear on Denmark. To keep open the\r\nmouth of the Baltic was an urgent necessity, otherwise we should lose\r\ntouch with the Anglo-Swedish forces campaigning against the French\r\nnear Stralsund.[160] Furthermore, it should be noted that Denmark held\r\nthe balance in naval affairs. France and her allies now had fifty-nine\r\nsail of the line ready for sea: the compact with the Czar would give\r\nher twenty-four more; and if Napoleon seized the eighteen Danish and\r\nnine Portuguese battleships, his fighting strength would be nearly\r\nequal to our own.[161] Canning therefore determined, on July 16th, to\r\ncompel Denmark to side with us, or at least to observe a neutrality\r\nfavourable to the British cause; and, to save her honour, he proposed\r\nto send an irresistible naval force.\r\n\r\n    \"Denmark's safety,\" he wrote on July 16th, \"is to be found, under\r\n    the present circumstances of the world, only in a balance of\r\n    opposite dangers. For it is not to be disguised that the influence\r\n    which France has acquired from recent events over the North of\r\n    Europe, might, unless balanced by the naval power of Great\r\n    Britain, leave to Denmark no other option than that of compliance\r\n    with the demands of Bonaparte.\"[162]\r\n\r\n_A balance of opposite dangers!_ In this phrase Canning summed up his\r\npolicy towards Denmark. Threatened by Napoleon on the land, she was to\r\nbe threatened by us from the sea; and Canning hoped that these\r\nopposite forces would, at least, secure Danish neutrality, without\r\nwhich Sweden must succumb in her struggle against France. That some\r\ncompulsion would be needed had long been clear. In fact, the use of\r\ncompulsion had first been recommended by the Russian and Prussian\r\nGovernments, which had gone so far as to include in the Treaty of\r\nBartenstein a proposal of common action, along with England, Austria\r\nand Sweden, _to compel Denmark to side with the allies against\r\nNapoleon_.[163] To this resolve England still clung, despite the\r\ndefection of the Czar. In truth, his present conduct made the case for\r\nthe coercion of Denmark infinitely more urgent.\r\n\r\nAs to the reality of Napoleon's designs on Denmark, there can be no\r\ndoubt. After his return to France, he wrote from St. Cloud, directing\r\nTalleyrand to express his displeasure that Denmark had not fulfilled\r\nher _promises_: \"Whatever my desire to treat Denmark well, I cannot\r\nhinder her suffering from having allowed the Baltic to be violated [by\r\nthe English expedition to Stralsund]; and, if England refuses Russia's\r\nmediation, Denmark must choose either to make war against England, or\r\nagainst me.\"[164] Whence it is clear that Denmark had given Napoleon\r\ngrounds for hoping that she would declare the Baltic a _mare clausum_.\r\n\r\nThe British Government had so far fathomed these designs as to see the\r\nurgency of the danger. Accordingly it proposed to Denmark a secret\r\ndefensive alliance, the chief terms of which were the handing over of\r\nthe Danish fleet, to be kept as a \"sacred pledge\" by us till the\r\npeace, a subsidy of £100,000 paid to Denmark for that fleet, and the\r\noffer of armed assistance in case she should be attacked by France.\r\nThis offer of defensive alliance was repulsed, and the Danish Prince\r\nRoyal determined to resist even the mighty armada which was now\r\nnearing his shores. Towards the close of August, eighty-eight British\r\nships were in the Sound and the Belt; and when the transports from\r\nRügen and Stralsund joined those from Yarmouth, as many as 15,400\r\ntroops were at hand, under the command of Lord Cathcart. A landing was\r\neffected near Copenhagen, and offers of alliance were again made,\r\nincluding the deposit of the Danish fleet; \"but if this offer is\r\nrejected now, it cannot be repeated. The captured property, public and\r\nprivate, must then belong to the captors: and the city, when taken,\r\nmust share the fate of conquered places.\" The Danes stoutly repelled\r\noffers and threats alike: the English batteries thereupon bombarded\r\nthe city until the gallant defenders capitulated (September 7th). The\r\nconditions hastily concluded by our commanders were that the British\r\nforces should occupy the citadel and dockyard for six weeks, should\r\ntake possession of the ships and naval stores, and thereupon evacuate\r\nZealand.\r\n\r\nThese terms were scrupulously carried out; and at the close of six\r\nweeks our forces sailed away with the Danish fleet, including fifteen\r\nsail of the line, fifteen frigates, and thirty-one small vessels. This\r\nend to the expedition was keenly regretted by Canning. In a lengthy\r\nMemorandum he left it on record that he desired, not merely Denmark's\r\nfleet, but her alliance. In his view nothing could save Europe but a\r\nfirm Anglo-Scandinavian league, which would keep open the Baltic and\r\nset bounds to the designs of the two Emperors. Only by such an\r\nalliance could Sweden be saved from Russia and France. Indeed,\r\nforeseeing the danger to Sweden from a French army acting from Zealand\r\nas a base, Canning proposed to Gustavus that he should occupy that\r\nisland, or, failing that, receive succour from a British force on his\r\nown shore of the Sound. But both offers were declined. The final\r\nefforts made to draw Denmark into our alliance were equally futile,\r\nand she kept up hostilities against us for nearly seven years. Thus\r\nCanning's scheme of alliance with the Scandinavian States failed.\r\nBritain gained, it is true, a further safeguard against invasion; but\r\nour statesman, while blaming the precipitate action of our commanders\r\nin insisting solely upon the surrender of the fleet, declared that\r\nthat action, apart from an Anglo-Danish alliance, was \"an act of great\r\ninjustice.\"[165]\r\n\r\nAnd as such it has been generally regarded, that is, by those who did\r\nnot, and could not, know the real state of the case. In one respect\r\nour action was unpardonable: it was not the last desperate effort of a\r\nlong period of struggle: it came after a time of selfish torpor fatal\r\nalike to our reputation and the interests of our allies. After\r\nprotesting their inability to help them, Ministers belied their own\r\nwords by the energy with which they acted against a small State. And\r\nthe prevalent opinion found expression in the protests uttered in\r\nParliament that it would have been better to face the whole might of\r\nthe French, Russian, and Danish navies than to emulate the conduct of\r\nthose who had overrun and despoiled Switzerland.\r\n\r\nMoreover, our action did not benefit Sweden, but just the reverse.\r\nCathcart's force, that had been helping the Swedes in the defence of\r\ntheir Pomeranian province, was withdrawn in order to strengthen our\r\nhands against Copenhagen. Thereupon the gallant Gustavus, overborne by\r\nthe weight of Marshal Brune's corps, sued for an armistice. It was\r\ngranted only on the condition that Stralsund should pass into Brune's\r\nhands (August 20th); and the Swedes, unable even to hold Rügen, were\r\nforced to give up that island also. Sick in health and weary of a\r\nworld that his chivalrous instincts scorned, Gustavus withdrew his\r\nforces into Sweden. Even there he was menaced. The hostilities which\r\nDenmark forthwith commenced against England and Sweden exposed his\r\nsouthern coasts; but he now chose to lean on the valour of his own\r\nsubjects rather than on the broken reed of British assistance, and\r\nawaited the attacks of the Danes on the west and of the Russians on\r\nhis province of Finland.\r\n\r\nThe news from Copenhagen also furnished the Czar with a good excuse\r\nfor hostilities with England. For such an event he had hitherto been\r\nby no means desirous. On his return from Tilsit to St. Petersburg he\r\nfound the nobility and merchants wholly opposed to a rupture with the\r\nSea Power, the former disdaining to clasp the hand of the conqueror of\r\nFriedland, the latter foreseeing ruin from the adoption of the\r\nContinental System; and when Napoleon sent Savary on a special mission\r\nto the Czar's Court, the Empress-Mother and nobles alike showed their\r\nabhorrence of \"the executioner of the Duc d'Enghien.\" In vain were\r\nimperial favours lavished on this envoy. He confessed to Napoleon that\r\nonly the Czar and the new Foreign Minister, Romantzoff, were\r\nfavourable to France; and it was soon obvious that their ardour for a\r\npartition of Turkey must disturb the warily balancing policy which\r\nNapoleon adopted as soon as the Czar's friendship seemed assured.\r\n\r\nThe dissolution of this artificial alliance was a task far beyond the\r\npowers of British statesmanship. To Alexander's offer of mediation\r\nbetween France and England Canning replied that we desired first to\r\nknow what were \"the just and equitable terms on which France intended\r\nto negotiate,\" and secondly what were the secret articles of the\r\nTreaty of Tilsit. That there were such was obvious; for the published\r\ntreaty made no mention of the Kings of Sardinia and of the two\r\nSicilies, in whom Alexander had taken so deep an interest. But the\r\nsecond request annoyed the Czar; and this feeling was intensified by\r\nour action at Copenhagen. Yet, though he pronounced it an act of\r\n\"unheard-of violence,\" the Russian official notes to our Government\r\nwere so far reassuring that Lord Castlereagh was able to write to Lord\r\nCathcart (September 22nd): \"Russia does not show any disposition to\r\nresent or to complain of what we have done at Copenhagen.... The tone\r\nof the Russian cabinet has become much more conciliatory to us since\r\nthey heard of your operations at Copenhagen.\"[166] It would seem,\r\nhowever, that this double-dealing was prompted by naval\r\nconsiderations. The Czar desired to temporize until his Mediterranean\r\nsquadron should gain a place of safety and his Baltic ports be encased\r\nin ice; but on 27th October (8th November, N.S.) he broke off all\r\ncommunications with us, and adopted the Continental System.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at the other extremity of Europe, events were transpiring\r\nthat served as the best excuse for our harshness towards Denmark. Even\r\nbefore our fleet sailed for the Sound, Napoleon was weaving his plans\r\nfor the destruction of Portugal. It is clear that he designed to\r\nstrike her first before taking any action against Denmark. During his\r\nreturn journey from Tilsit to Paris, he directed Talleyrand to send\r\norders to Lisbon for the closing of all Portuguese ports against\r\nBritish goods by September the 1st--\"in default of which I declare war\r\non Portugal.\" He also ordered the massing of 20,000 French troops at\r\nBayonne in readiness to join the Spanish forces that were to threaten\r\nthe little kingdom.[167]\r\n\r\nWhat crime had Portugal committed? She had of late been singularly\r\npassive: anxiously she looked on at the gigantic strifes that were\r\nengulfing the smaller States one by one. Her conduct towards Napoleon\r\nhad been far less provocative than that of Denmark towards England.\r\nThreatened with partition by him and Spain in 1801, she had eagerly\r\nsnatched at peace, and on the rupture of the Peace of Amiens was fain\r\nto purchase her neutrality at the cost of a heavy subsidy to France,\r\nwhich she still paid in the hope of prolonging her \"existence on\r\nsufferance.\"[168] That hope now faded away.\r\n\r\nAs far back as February, 1806, Napoleon had lent a ready ear to the\r\nplans which Godoy, the all-powerful Minister at Madrid, had proposed\r\nfor the partition of Portugal; and, in the month of July following,\r\nTalleyrand held out to our plenipotentiary at Paris the threat that,\r\nunless England speedily made peace with France, Napoleon would annex\r\nSwitzerland--\"but still less can we alter, for any other\r\nconsideration, our intention of invading Portugal. The army destined\r\nfor that purpose is already assembling at Bayonne.\" A year's respite\r\nwas gained for the House of Braganza by the campaigns of Jena and\r\nFriedland. But now, with the tenacity of his nature, the Emperor\r\nreturned to the plan, actually tried in 1801 and prepared for in 1806,\r\nof crushing our faithful ally in order to compel us to make peace. On\r\nthis occasion he counted on certain success, as may be seen by the\r\nfollowing extract from the despatch of the Portuguese ambassador at\r\nParis to his Government:\r\n\r\n    \"On Sunday afternoon [August 2nd] there was a diplomatic Levée.\r\n    The Emperor came up to me as I stood in the circle, and in a low\r\n    voice said: 'Have you written to your Court? Have you despatched a\r\n    courier with my final determination?'--I replied in the\r\n    affirmative.--'Very well,' said the Emperor, 'then by this time\r\n    your Court knows that she must break with England before the 1st\r\n    of September. It is the only way to accelerate peace.'--As the\r\n    place did not permit discussion on my part, I answered: 'I should\r\n    think, Sire, that England must now be sincerely anxious to make\r\n    peace.'--'Oh,' replied the Emperor, 'we are very certain of that:\r\n    however, in all cases, you must break either with England or\r\n    France before the 1st of September.'--He then turned about and\r\n    addressed himself to the Danish Minister, as far as I could judge\r\n    to the same purport.\"[169]\r\n\r\nEqually confident is Napoleon's tone in the lately published letter of\r\nSeptember 7th:\r\n\r\n    \"As soon as I received news of the English expedition against\r\n    Copenhagen,[170] I caused Portugal to be informed that all her\r\n    ports must be closed to England, and I massed an army of 40,000\r\n    men at Bayonne to join the Spaniards in enforcing this action, if\r\n    necessary. But a letter I have just received from the Prince\r\n    Regent [of Portugal] leads me to presume that this last measure\r\n    will not be necessary, that the Portuguese ports will be closed to\r\n    the English by the time this is read, and that Portugal will have\r\n    declared war against England. On the other hand, my flotilla will\r\n    be ready for action on 1st October, and I shall have a large army\r\n    at Boulogne, ready to attempt a _coup de main_ on England.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter concludes by ordering that all British diplomatists are to\r\nbe driven _out of Europe_, and that Sweden must make common cause with\r\nFrance and Russia. Such were the means to be used for forcing\r\naffrighted Peace again to visit this distracted earth.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the fate of the British race seemed for the time to hang\r\nupon the events at Copenhagen and Lisbon. Very much depended on the\r\naction of the Prince Regent of Portugal. Had he tamely submitted to\r\nNapoleon's ukase and placed his fleet and his vast colonial empire at\r\nthe service of France, it is doubtful whether even the high-souled\r\nCanning would not have stooped to surrender in face of odds so\r\noverwhelming. The young statesman's anxiety as to the action of\r\nPortugal is attested by many a long and minutely corrected despatch to\r\nViscount Strangford, our envoy at Lisbon. But, fortunately for us,\r\nNapoleon committed the blunder which so often marred his plans: he\r\npushed them too far: he required the Prince Regent to adopt a course\r\nof conduct repellent to an honourable man, namely, to confiscate the\r\nmerchandise and property of British merchants who had long trusted the\r\ngood faith of the House of Braganza. To this last demand the prince\r\nopposed a dignified resistance, though on all other points he gave\r\nway. This will appear from Lord Strangford's despatch of August 13th:\r\n\r\n    \" ... The Portuguese Ministers place all their hopes of being able\r\n    to ward off this terrible blow in the certainty which they\r\n    entertain of England being obliged to enter into negotiations for\r\n    a general peace.... The very existence of the Portuguese Monarchy\r\n    depends on the celerity with which England shall meet the pacific\r\n    interference of the Emperor of Russia. The Prince Regent gives the\r\n    most solemn promise that he will not on any account consent to the\r\n    measure of confiscating the property of British subjects residing\r\n    under his protection. But I think that if France could be induced\r\n    to give up this point, and limit her demands to the exclusion of\r\n    British commerce from Portugal, the Government of this country\r\n    would accede to them....\"\r\n\r\nA week later he states that Portugal begged England to put up with a\r\ntemporary rupture, and reports that a quantity of diamonds had been\r\ntaken out of the Treasury and sent to Paris to be distributed in\r\npresents to persons supposed to possess influence over the minds of\r\nBonaparte and Talleyrand. It would be interesting to trace the history\r\nof these diamonds. But, as Napoleon had recently awarded sums\r\namounting in all to 26,582,000 francs from out of the estates\r\nconfiscated in Poland,[171] signs of sudden affluence were widespread\r\nin Paris and rendered it difficult to detect the receivers of the\r\ngems. Talleyrand was the usual recipient of such _douceurs_. But on\r\nAugust the 14th he had retired from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\r\ngaining the title of Vice Grand-Elector; and, if we are to be guided,\r\nnot by the statements of his personal foes, Hauterive and Pasquier,\r\nbut by the determination which he is known to have formed at Tilsit,\r\nthat he would not be \"the executioner of Europe,\" we may judge that he\r\ndisapproved of the barbarous treatment meted out to Prussia and now\r\nplanned against Portugal.[172]\r\n\r\nAs has been stated above, the partition of this kingdom had been\r\nplanned by Godoy in concert with Napoleon early in 1806. That pampered\r\nminion of the Spanish Court, angry at the shelving of plans which\r\npromised to yield him a third of Portugal, called Spain to arms while\r\nNapoleon was marching to Jena, an affront which the conqueror seemed\r\nto overlook but never really forgave. Now, however, he appeared wholly\r\nto enter into Godoy's scheme; and, while the Prince Regent of Portugal\r\nwas appealing to his pity, the Emperor (September 25th, 1807) charged\r\nDuroc to confer with Godoy's confidential agent at Paris, Don\r\nIzquierdo. \" ...As for Portugal, I make no difficulty about granting to\r\nthe King of Spain a suzerainty over Portugal, and even taking part of\r\nit away for the Queen of Etruria and the Prince of the Peace [Godoy].\"\r\nDuroc was also to point out the difficulty, now that \"all Italy\"\r\nbelonged to Napoleon, of allowing \"that deformity,\" the kingdom of\r\nEtruria, to disfigure the peninsula. The change would in fact, doubly\r\nbenefit the French Emperor. It would enable him completely to exclude\r\nBritish commerce from the port of Leghorn, where it was trickling in\r\nalarmingly, and also to place the mouths of the Tagus and Douro in the\r\nhands of obedient vassals.\r\n\r\nSuch was the scheme in outline. Despite the offer of the Prince Regent\r\nto obey all Napoleon's behests except that relating to the seizure of\r\nBritish subjects and their property, war was irrevocably resolved on\r\nby October the 12th.[173] And on October the 27th a secret convention\r\nwas signed at the Palace of Fontainebleau for arranging \"the future\r\nlot of Portugal by a healthy policy and conformably to the interests\r\nof France and Spain.\" Portugal was now to be divided into three very\r\nunequal parts: the largest portion, comprising Estremadura, Beira, and\r\nTras-os Montes, was reserved for a future arrangement at the general\r\npeace, but meanwhile was to be held by France: Algarve and Alemtejo\r\nwere handed over to Godoy; while the diminutive province of Entre\r\nMinho e Douro was flung as a sop to the young King of Etruria and his\r\nmother, a princess of the House of Spain, to console them for the loss\r\nof Etruria. A vague promise was made that the House of Braganza might\r\nbe reinstated in the first of these three portions, in case England\r\nrestored Gibraltar, Trinidad, and other colonies taken by her from\r\nSpain or her allies; and Napoleon guaranteed to the King of Spain his\r\npossessions in Europe, exclusive of the Balearic Isles, offering also\r\nto recognize him as Emperor of the Two Americas.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Junot was leading his army corps from Bayonne towards\r\nSalamanca and Ciudad Rodrigo, to give effect to this healthful\r\narrangement. This general, whom it was desirable to remove from Paris\r\non account of his rather too open _liaison_ with one of the Bonaparte\r\nprincesses, was urged to the utmost speed and address by the Emperor.\r\nHe must cover the whole 200 leagues in thirty-five days; lack of\r\nprovisions must not hinder the march, for \"20,000 men can live\r\nanywhere, even in a desert\"; and, above all, as the Prince Regent had\r\nagain offered to declare war on England, he (Junot) could represent\r\nthat he came as an ally: \"I have already informed you that my\r\nintention in authorizing you to enter that land as an ally was to\r\nenable you to seize its fleet, but that my mind was fully made up to\r\ntake possession of Portugal.\"[174] Lisbon, in fact, was to be served\r\nas Venice was ten years before, the lion donning the skin of the fox\r\nso as to effect a peaceful seizure. But that ruse could hardly succeed\r\ntwice. The Prince Regent had his ships ready for flight. The bluff and\r\nheadstrong Junot, nicknamed \"the tempest\" by the army, was too artless\r\nto catch the prince by guile; but he hurried his soldiers over\r\nmountains and through flooded gorges until, on November 30th, 1,500\r\ntattered, shoeless, famished grenadiers straggled into Lisbon--to find\r\nthat the royal quarry had flown.\r\n\r\nThe Prince Regent took this momentous resolve with the utmost\r\nreluctance. For many weeks he had clung to the hope that Napoleon\r\nwould spare him; and though he accepted a convention with England,\r\nwhereby he gained the convoy of our men-of-war across the Atlantic and\r\nthe promise of aggrandizement in South America, he still continued to\r\ntemporize, and that too, when a British fleet was at hand in the Tagus\r\nstrong enough to thwart the designs of the Russian squadron there\r\npresent to prevent his departure. When the French were within two\r\ndays' march of Lisbon, Lord Strangford feared that the Portuguese\r\nfleet would be delivered into their hands; and only after a trenchant\r\ndeclaration that further vacillation would be taken as a sign of\r\nhostility to Great Britain, did the Prince Regent resolve to seek\r\nbeyond the seas the independence which was denied to him in his own\r\nrealm.[175]\r\n\r\nFew scenes are more pathetic than the departure of the House of\r\nBraganza from the cradle of its birth. Love for the Prince Regent as a\r\nman, mingled with pity for the demented Queen, held the populace of\r\nLisbon in tearful silence as the royal family and courtiers filed\r\nalong the quays, followed by agonized groups of those who had decided\r\nto share their trials. But silence gave way to wails of despair as the\r\nexiles embarked on the heaving estuary and severed the last links with\r\nEurope. Slowly the fleet began to beat down the river in the teeth of\r\nan Atlantic gale. Near the mouth the refugees were received with a\r\nroyal salute by the British fleet, and under its convoy they breasted\r\nthe waves of the ocean and the perils of the future.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of England towards Denmark and that of Napoleon towards\r\nPortugal call for a brief comparison. Those small kingdoms were the\r\nvictims of two powerful States whose real or fancied interests\r\nprompted them to the domination of the land and of the sea. But when\r\nwe compare the actions of the two Great Powers, important differences\r\nbegin to reveal themselves. England had far more cause for complaint\r\nagainst Denmark than Napoleon had against Portugal. The hostility of\r\nthe Danes to the recent coalition was notorious. To compel them to\r\nchange their policy without loss of national honour, we sent the most\r\npowerful armada that had ever left our shores, with offers of alliance\r\nand a demand that their fleet, the main object of Napoleon's designs,\r\nshould be delivered up to be held in deposit. The offer was refused,\r\nand we seized the fleet. The act was brutal, but it was at least open\r\nand above board, and the capitulation of September 7th was\r\nscrupulously observed, even when the Danes prepared to renew\r\nhostilities.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the demands of Napoleon on the Court of Lisbon were\r\nsuch as no honourable prince could accept; they were relentlessly\r\npressed on in spite of the offer of the Prince Regent to meet him in\r\nevery particular save one; the appeals of the victim were deliberately\r\nused by the aggressor to further his own rapacious designs; and the\r\nenterprise fell short of ending in a massacre only because the glamour\r\nof the French arms so dazzled the susceptible people of the south\r\nthat, for the present, they sank helplessly away at the sight of two\r\nbattalions of spectres. Finally, Portugal was partitioned--or rather\r\nit was kept entirely by Napoleon; for, after the promises of partition\r\nhad done their work, the sleeping partners in the transaction were\r\nquietly shelved, and it was then seen that Portugal had finally served\r\nas the bait for ensnaring Spain. To this subject we shall return in\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\nIn Italy also, the Juggernaut car of the Continental System rolled\r\nover the small States. The Kingdom of Etruria, which in 1802 had\r\nserved as an easy means of buying the whole of Louisiana from the\r\nSpanish Bourbons, was now wrested from that complaisant House, and in\r\nDecember was annexed to the French Empire.\r\n\r\nThe Pope also passed under the yoke. For a long time the relations\r\nbetween Pius VII. and Napoleon had been strained. Gentle as the\r\nPontiff was by nature, he had declined to exclude all British\r\nmerchandise from his States, or to accept an alliance with Eugène and\r\nJoseph. He also angered Napoleon by persistently refusing to dissolve\r\nthe marriage of Jerome Buonaparte with Miss Paterson; and an\r\ninteresting correspondence ensued, culminating in a long diatribe\r\nwhich Eugène was charged to forward to the Vatican as an extract from\r\na private letter of Napoleon to himself.[176] Pius VII. was to be\r\nprivately warned that Napoleon had done more good to religion than the\r\nPope had done harm. Christ had said that His Kingdom was not of this\r\nworld. Why then did the Pope set himself above Christ? Why did he\r\nrefuse to render to Cæsar that which was Cæsar's?--A fortnight later\r\nthe Emperor advised Eugène to despatch troops in the direction of\r\nBologna--\"and if the Pope commits an imprudence, it will be a fine\r\nopportunity for depriving him of the Roman States.\"\r\n\r\nNo imprudence was committed. Yet, in the following January, Napoleon\r\nordered his troops to occupy Rome, alleging that the Eternal City was\r\na hotbed of intrigues fomented by England and the ex-Queen of Naples,\r\nthat Neapolitan rebels had sought an asylum in the Papal States, and\r\nthat, though he had no wish to deprive the Pope of his territories,\r\nyet he must include him in his \"system.\" When Pius VII. refused to\r\ncommit himself to a policy which would involve war with England,\r\nNapoleon ordered that his lands east of the Apennines should be\r\nannexed to the Kingdom of Italy (April 2nd, 1808). Napoleon thus\r\ngained complete control over the Adriatic coasts, which, along with\r\nthe island of Corfu, had long engaged his most earnest attention.[177]\r\n\r\nTrue to his aim of forcing or enticing all maritime States into a\r\nmighty confederacy for the humiliation of England, Napoleon had given\r\nmost heed to lands possessing extensive seaboards. Northern Italy,\r\nHolland, Naples, North Germany, Prussia, Russia, Portugal, Spain,\r\nDenmark, and Central Italy had, in turn, adopted his system. On\r\nAustria he exerted a less imperious pressure; for her coast-line of\r\nTrieste and Croatia was so easily controlled by his Italian and\r\nDalmatian territories that English merchandise with difficulty found\r\nadmittance. Yet, in order to carry out there also his policy of\r\n\"Thorough,\" he brought the arguments of Paris and St. Petersburg to\r\nbear on the Court of Vienna; and on February 18th, 1808, Austria was\r\nenrolled in a league that might well be called continental; for in the\r\nspring of that year it embraced every land save Sweden and Turkey.\r\n\r\nHis activity at this time almost passes belief. While he fastened his\r\ngrip on the Continent, gallicized the institutions of Italy and\r\nGermany, and almost daily instructed his brothers in the essentials of\r\nsuccessful statecraft, he found time to turn his thoughts once more to\r\nthe East, and to mark every device of England for lengthening her\r\nlease of life. Noticing that we had annulled our blockade of the Elbe\r\nand Weser, with the aim of getting our goods introduced there by\r\nneutral ships, Napoleon charged his Finance Minister, Gaudin, to\r\nprepare a decree for pressing hard on neutrals who had touched at any\r\nof our ports or carried wares that could be proved to be of British\r\norigin.[178]\r\n\r\nHe was perfectly correct in his surmise that English goods were about\r\nto be sent into the Continent extensively on neutral vessels. After\r\nthe consequences of the Treaty of Tilsit had been fully developed,\r\nthat was almost their only means of entry. \"In August, September and\r\nOctober, British commerce lay prostrate and motionless until a\r\nprotecting and self-defensive system was interposed by our Orders in\r\nCouncil.\"[179] The first of these ordered reprisals against the new\r\nNapoleonic States (November 4th): a week later came a second which\r\ndeclared that, as the Orders of January had not induced the enemy to\r\nrelax his commercial hostilities, but these were now enforced with\r\nincreased rigour, any port whence the British flag was excluded would\r\nbe treated as if it were actually blockaded; that is, the principle of\r\nthe legality of a nominal blockade, abandoned in 1801, was now\r\nreaffirmed. The carriage of hostile colonial products was likewise\r\nprohibited to neutrals, though certain exceptions were allowed. Also\r\nany neutral vessel carrying \"certificates of origin\"--a device for\r\ndistinguishing between British and neutral goods--was to be considered\r\na lawful prize of war. A third Order in Council of the same date\r\nallowed goods to be imported into the United Kingdom from a hostile\r\nport in neutral ships, subject to the ordinary duties, and bonding\r\nfacilities were granted for the re-exportation of such goods to any\r\nfriendly or neutral port.[180] These orders were designed to draw\r\nneutral commerce through our ports, and to give secret facilities for\r\nthe carriage of our goods by neutrals, while pressing upon those that\r\nobeyed Napoleon's system.\r\n\r\nThe harshest of them was that which encouraged the searching of\r\nneutral vessels for certificates of origin--a measure as severe as the\r\nconfiscation of British property by Napoleon, which it was designed to\r\ndefeat. And we may note here that the friction resulting from our\r\nOrders in Council and our enforcement of the right of search led to\r\nthe United States passing a Non-Intercourse Act (December 23rd, 1807)\r\nthat preluded active hostilities against us. It also led Napoleon to\r\nconfiscate all American ships in his harbours after April 17th, 1808.\r\n\r\nThe November Orders in Council soon drew a reply from Napoleon. He\r\nheard of them during a progress through the north of Italy, and from\r\nMilan he flung back his retort, the famous Milan Decrees of November\r\n23rd and December 17th. He thereby declared every neutral ship, which\r\nsubmitted to those orders, to be denationalized and good prize of war;\r\nand the same doom was pronounced against every vessel sailing to or\r\nfrom any port in the United Kingdom or its colonies or possessions.\r\nBut these measures were not to affect ships of those States that\r\ncompelled Great Britain to respect their flag. The islanders might\r\nwell be dismayed at the prospect of a seclusion which promised to\r\nrecall the Virgilian line:\r\n\r\n  \"penitus toto divisos orbe Britannos.\"\r\n\r\nYet they resolved to pit the resources of the outer world against the\r\nmilitarism of Napoleon; and, drawing the resources of the tropics to\r\nthe new power-looms of Lancashire and Yorkshire, they might well hope\r\nto pour their unequalled goods into Europe from points of vantage such\r\nas Sicily, Gibraltar, the Channel Islands, and Heligoland. There were\r\nmany Englishmen who believed that the November Orders in Council\r\nbrought nothing but harm to our cause. They argued that our\r\nmanufactured goods must find their way into the Continent in spite of\r\nthe Berlin Decrees; and they could point to the curious fact that\r\nBourrienne, Napoleon's agent at Hamburg, when charged to procure\r\n50,000 overcoats for the French army during the Eylau campaign, was\r\nobliged to buy them from England.[181]\r\n\r\nThe incident certainly proves the folly of the Continental System. And\r\nif we had had to consult our manufacturing interests alone, a policy\r\nof _laisser faire_ would doubtless have been the best. England,\r\nhowever, prided herself on her merchant service: to that she looked as\r\nthe nursery for the royal navy: and the abandonment of the world's\r\ncarrying trade to neutrals would have seemed an act of high treason.\r\nHer acts of retaliation against the Berlin Decrees and the policy of\r\nTilsit were harsh and high-handed. But they were adopted during a\r\npitiless commercial strife; and, in warfare of so novel and desperate\r\na kind, acts must unfortunately be judged by their efficacy to harm\r\nthe foe rather than by the standards of morality that hold good during\r\npeace. Outwardly, it seemed as if England were doomed. She had lost\r\nher allies and alienated the sympathies of neutrals. But from the sea\r\nshe was able to exert on the Napoleonic States a pressure that was\r\ngradual, cumulative, and resistless; and the future was to prove the\r\nwisdom of the words of Mollien: \"England waged a warfare of modern\r\ntimes; Napoleon, that of ancient times. There are times and cases when\r\nan anachronism is fatal.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, at the very time when the Emperor was about to complete his\r\ngreat experiment by subduing Sweden and preparing for the partition of\r\nTurkey, it sustained a fatal shock by the fierce rising of the Spanish\r\npeople against his usurped authority.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH RISING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relations of Spain to France during the twelve years that preceded\r\nthe rising of 1808 are marked by acts of folly and unmanly\r\ncomplaisance that promised utterly to degrade a once proud and\r\nsensitive people. They were the work of the senile and spiritless\r\nKing, Charles IV., of his intriguing consort, and, above all, of her\r\nparamour, the all-powerful Minister Godoy. Of an ancient and\r\nhonourable family, endowed with a fine figure, courtly address, and\r\nunscrupulous arts, this man had wormed himself into the royal\r\nconfidence; and after bringing about a favourable peace with France in\r\n1795, he was styled The Prince of the Peace.\r\n\r\nIn the next year the meaning of the French alliance was revealed in\r\nthe Treaty of St. Ildefonso, which required Spain to furnish troops,\r\nships, and subsidies for the war against England, a state of vassalage\r\nwhich was made harder by Napoleon. The results are well known. After\r\nbeing forced by him to cede Trinidad to us at the Peace of Amiens, she\r\nsacrificed her navy at Trafalgar, saw her colonies and commerce decay\r\nand her finances shrivel for lack of the golden streams formerly\r\npoured in by Mexico and Peru.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1806, while sinking into debt and disgrace, the Court\r\nof Madrid heard with indignation of Napoleon's design to hand over the\r\nBalearic Isles to the Spanish Bourbons whom he had driven from Naples\r\nand proposed to drive from Sicily. At once Spanish pride caught fire\r\nand clutched at means of revenge.[182] Godoy was further incensed by\r\nthe sudden abandonment of the plans which he had long discussed with\r\nNapoleon for the partition of Portugal, plans which gave him the\r\nprospect of reigning as King over the southern portion of that\r\nrealm.[183] Accordingly, when the Emperor was entering upon the Jena\r\ncampaign, he summoned the Spanish people to arms in a most threatening\r\nmanner. The news of the collapse of Prussia ended his bravado.\r\nComplaisance again reigned at Madrid, and 15,000 Spaniards were sent,\r\nat Napoleon's demand, to serve on the borders of Denmark, while the\r\nautocrat of the West perfected his plans against the Iberian\r\nPeninsula. As was noted in the previous chapter, the Emperor renewed\r\nhis offers of a partition of Portugal in the early autumn of 1807; and\r\nin pursuance of the secret Treaty of Fontainebleau, Junot's corps\r\nmarched through Spain into Portugal, where they were helped by a\r\nSpanish corps.\r\n\r\nIt is significant that, as early as October 17th, 1807, Napoleon\r\nordered his general to send a detailed description of the country and\r\nof his line of march, the engineer officers being specially charged to\r\nsend sketches, \"_which it is important to have_.\" Other French\r\ndivisions then crossed the Pyrenees, under plea of keeping open\r\nJunot's communications with France; and spies were sent to observe the\r\nstate of the chief Spanish strongholds. Others were charged to report\r\non the condition of the Spanish army and the state of public opinion;\r\nwhile Junot was cautioned to keep a sharp watch on the Spanish troops\r\nin Portugal, to allow no fortress to be in their hands, and to send\r\nall the Portuguese troops away to France. Thus, in the early days of\r\n1808, Napoleon had some 20,000 troops in Portugal, about 40,000 in the\r\nnorth of Spain, and 12,000 in Catalonia. By various artifices they\r\ngained admission into the strongholds of Pamplona, Monjuik, Barcelona,\r\nSt. Sebastian, and Figueras, so that by the month of March the north\r\nand west of the peninsula had passed quietly into his hands, while the\r\ngreater part of the Spanish army was doing his work in Portugal or on\r\nthe shores of the Baltic.[184]\r\n\r\nThese proceedings began to arouse alarm and discontent among the\r\nSpanish people; but on its Government their influence was as benumbing\r\nas that which the boa-constrictor exerts on its prey. In vain did\r\nCharles IV. and Godoy strive to set a limit to the numbers of the\r\nauxiliaries that poured across the Pyrenees to help them against\r\nfabled English expeditions. In vain did they beg that the partition of\r\nPortugal might now proceed in accordance with the terms of the secret\r\nTreaty of Fontainebleau. The King was curtly told that affairs were\r\nnot yet ripe for the publication of that treaty.[185] And the growing\r\nconviction that he had been duped poured gall into the cup of family\r\nbitterness that had long been full to overflowing.\r\n\r\nThe scandalous relations of the Queen with Godoy had deeply incensed\r\nthe heir to the throne, Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias. His attitude of\r\ncovert opposition to his parents and their minion was strengthened by\r\nthe influence of his bride, a daughter of the ex-Queen of Naples, and\r\ntheir palace was the headquarters of all who hoped to end the\r\ndegradation of the kingdom. As later events were to prove, Ferdinand\r\nhad not the qualities of courage and magnanimity that command general\r\nhomage; but it was enough for his countrymen that he opposed the\r\nCourt. In 1806 his consort died; and on October 11th, 1807, without\r\nconsulting his father, he secretly wrote to Napoleon, requesting the\r\nhand of a Bonaparte princess in marriage, and stating that such an\r\nalliance was the ardent wish of all Spaniards, while they would abhor\r\nhis union with a sister of the Princess of the Peace. To this letter\r\nNapoleon sent no reply. But Charles IV. had some inkling of the fact\r\nthat the prince had been treating direct with Napoleon; and this,\r\nalong with another unfilial action of the prince, furnished an excuse\r\nfor a charge of high treason. It was spitefully pressed home and was\r\nrevoked only on his humble request for the King's pardon.\r\n\r\nNow, this \"School for Scandal\" was being played at Madrid at the time\r\nwhen Napoleon was arranging the partition of Portugal; and the schism\r\nin the Spanish royal House may well have strengthened his\r\ndetermination to end its miserable existence and give a good\r\ngovernment to Spain. At the close of the so-called palace plot,\r\nCharles IV. informed his august ally of _that frightful attempt_, and\r\nbegged him to _give the aid of his lights and his counsels_.[186] The\r\ncraven-hearted King thus himself opened the door for that intervention\r\nwhich Napoleon had already meditated. His resolve now rapidly\r\nhardened. At the close of January, 1808, he wrote to Junot asking him:\r\n\"If unexpected events occurred in Spain, what would you fear from the\r\nSpanish troops? Could you easily rid yourself of them?\"[187] On\r\nFebruary the 20th he appointed Murat, Grand Duke of Berg, to be his\r\nLieutenant in Spain and commander of the French Forces. The choice of\r\nthis bluff, headstrong cavalier, who had done so much to provoke\r\nPrussia in 1806, certainly betokened a forward policy. Yet the Emperor\r\ncontinued to smile on the Spanish Court, and gave a sort of half\r\nsanction to the union of Ferdinand with a daughter of Lucien\r\nBonaparte.[188] In fact, the hope of this alliance was now used to\r\nkeep quiet the numerous partisans of Ferdinand, while Murat advanced\r\nrapidly towards Madrid. To his Lieutenant the Emperor wrote (March\r\n16th): \"Continue your kindly talk. Reassure the King, the Prince of\r\nthe Peace, the Prince of Asturias, the Queen. The chief thing is to\r\nreach Madrid, to rest your troops and replenish your provisions. Say\r\nthat I am about to come so as to arrange matters.\"\r\n\r\nAs to Napoleon's real aims, Murat was in complete ignorance; and he\r\nrepeatedly complained of the lack of confidence which a brother-in-law\r\nhad a right to expect.[189] But while the Grand Duke of Berg beamed on\r\nthe Spaniards with meaningless affability, Izquierdo, Godoy's secret\r\nagent at Paris, troubled his master with gloomy reports of the\r\ndeepening reserve and lowering threats of Ministers at Paris. There\r\nwas talk of requiring from Spain the cession of her lands between the\r\nPyrenees and the Ebro: there were even dark suggestions as to the need\r\nof dethroning the Spanish Bourbons once for all. Interpreting these\r\nhints in the light of their own consciences, the King, Queen, and\r\nfavourite saw themselves in imagination flung forth into the Atlantic,\r\na butt to the scorn of mankind; and they prepared to flee to the New\r\nWorld betimes, with the needful treasure.\r\n\r\nBut there, too, Napoleon forestalled them. On February 21st a secret\r\norder was sent to a French squadron to anchor off Cadiz and stop the\r\nKing and Queen of Spain if they sought to \"repeat the scene of\r\nLisbon.\"[190] Their escape to America would be even more favourable to\r\nEngland than the flight of the Court of Lisbon had been; and Napoleon\r\ntook good care that the King, to whom he had awarded the title of\r\nEmperor of the two Americas, should remain a prisoner in Europe.\r\nScared, however, by the approach of Murat and the news from Paris,\r\nCharles still prepared for flight; and the Queen's anxiety to save her\r\nfavourite from the growing fury of the populace also bent her desires\r\nseawards.\r\n\r\nThe Court was at the palace of Aranjuez, not far from Madrid, and it\r\nseemed easy to escape into Andalusia, and to carry away, by guile or\r\nby force, the heir to the throne. But Ferdinand, who hoped for\r\ndeliverance at the hands of the French, thwarted the scheme by a\r\ntimely hint to his faithful guards. At once his partisans gathered\r\nround him; and the people, rushing to Godoy's residence, madly\r\nransacked it in the hope of tearing to pieces the author of the\r\nnation's ruin. After thirty-six hours' concealment, Godoy ventured to\r\nsteal forth; at once he was discovered, was kicked and beaten; and\r\nonly the intervention of Ferdinand, prompted by the agonized\r\nentreaties of his mother, availed to save the dregs of that wretched\r\nlife. The roars of the crowd around the palace, and the smashing of\r\nthe royal carriage, now decided the King to abdicate; and he declared\r\nthat his declining years and failing health now led him to yield the\r\ncrown to Ferdinand (March 19th, 1808).\r\n\r\nLoud was the acclaim that greeted the young King when he entered\r\nMadrid; but the rejoicings were soon damped by the ambiguous behaviour\r\nof Murat, who, on entering Madrid at the head of his troops, skilfully\r\nevaded any recognition of Ferdinand as King. In fact, Murat had\r\nreceived (March 21st) a letter from Charles IV.'s daughter begging for\r\nhis help to her parents at Aranjuez; and it soon transpired that the\r\nex-King and Queen now repented of their abdication, which they\r\nrepresented as brought about by force and therefore null and void. The\r\nGrand Duke of Berg saw the advantage which this dispute might give to\r\nNapoleon; and he begged the Emperor to come immediately to Madrid for\r\nthe settlement of matters on which he alone could decide. To this\r\nNapoleon replied (March 30th) commending his Lieutenant's prudence,\r\nand urging him to escort Charles IV. to the Escurial as King, while\r\nGodoy was also to be protected and sent to Bayonne.\r\n\r\nTo this town the Emperor set out on April the 2nd, as though he would\r\nthence proceed to Madrid. Ferdinand, meanwhile, was treated with\r\nguarded courtesy that kept alive his hope of an alliance with a French\r\nprincess. To favour this notion, Napoleon despatched the wariest of\r\nhis agents, Savary, who artfully persuaded him to meet the Emperor at\r\nBurgos. He succeeded, and even induced him to continue his journey to\r\nVittoria. At that place the citizens sought to cut the traces of the\r\nroyal carriage, so much did they fear treachery if he proceeded\r\nfurther. Yet the young King, beguiled by the Emperor's letter of April\r\n16th, which offered the hand of a French princess, prolonged his\r\njourney, crossed the frontier, and was received by Napoleon at Bayonne\r\n(April 20th). His arguments, proving that his father's abdication had\r\nbeen voluntary, fell on deaf ears. The Emperor invited him to dinner,\r\nand afterwards sent Savary to inform him that he must hand back the\r\ncrown to his father. To this Ferdinand returned a firm refusal; and\r\nhis advisers, Escoiquiz and Labrador, ventured to warn the Emperor\r\nthat the Spaniards would swear eternal hatred to France if he tampered\r\nwith the crown of Spain. Napoleon listened good-humouredly, pulled\r\nEscoiquiz by the ear as a sign of his personal regard, and added: \"You\r\nare a deep fellow; but, I tell you, the Bourbons will never let me\r\nalone.\" On the next day he offered Ferdinand the throne of Etruria. It\r\nwas coldly declined.[191]\r\n\r\nCharles IV., his Queen, and Godoy, arrived at Bayonne at the close of\r\nApril. The ex-King had offered to put himself and his claim in\r\nNapoleon's hands, which was exactly what the Emperor desired. The\r\nfeeble creature now poured forth his bile on his disobedient son, and\r\npeevishly bade him restore the crown. Ferdinand assented, provided his\r\nfather would really reign, and would dismiss those advisers who were\r\nhated by the nation; but the attempt to impose conditions called forth\r\na flash of senile wrath, along with the remark that \"one ought to do\r\neverything _for_ the people and nothing _by_ the people.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the men of Madrid were not acting with the passivity desired\r\nby their philosophizing monarch. At first they had welcomed Murat as\r\ndelivering them from the detested yoke of Godoy; but the conduct of\r\nthe French in their capital, and the detention of Ferdinand at\r\nBayonne, aroused angry feelings, which burst forth on May the 2nd, and\r\nlong defied the grapeshot of Murat's guns and the sabres of his\r\ntroopers. The news of this so-called revolt gave Napoleon another\r\nhandle against his guests. He hurried to Charles and cowed him by\r\nwell-simulated signs of anger, which that _roi fainéant_ thereupon\r\nvented on his son, with a passion that was outdone only by the shrill\r\ngibes of the Queen. At the close of this strange scene, the Emperor\r\ninterposed with a few stern words, threatening to treat the prince as\r\na rebel if he did not that very evening restore the crown to his\r\nfather. Ferdinand braved the parental taunts in stolid silence, but\r\nbefore the trenchant threats of Napoleon he quailed, and broke down.\r\n\r\nResistance was now at an end. On that same night (May 5th) the Emperor\r\nconcluded with Godoy a convention whereby Charles IV. agreed to hand\r\nover to Napoleon the crowns of Spain and the Indies, on consideration\r\nthat those dominions should remain intact, should keep the Roman\r\nCatholic faith to the exclusion of all others, and that he himself\r\nshould be pensioned off with the estates of Compiègne and Chambord,\r\nreceiving a yearly income of seven and a half million francs, payable\r\nby the French treasury. The Spanish princes were similarly treated,\r\nFerdinand signing away his rights for a castle and a pension. To crown\r\nthe farce, Napoleon ordered Talleyrand to receive them at his estate\r\nof Valençay, and amuse them with actors and the charms of female\r\nsociety. Thus the choicest humorist of the age was told off to\r\nentertain three uninteresting exiles; and the ex-Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs, who disapproved of the treachery of Bayonne, was made to\r\nappear the Emperor's accomplice.\r\n\r\nSuch were the means whereby Napoleon gained the crowns of Spain and\r\nthe Indies, without striking a blow.\r\n\r\nHis excuse for the treachery as expressed at the time was as follows:\r\n\"My action is not good from a certain point of view, I know. But my\r\npolicy demands that I shall not leave in my rear, so near to Paris, a\r\ndynasty hostile to mine.\" From this and from other similar remarks, it\r\nwould seem that his resolve to dethrone the Bourbons was taken while\r\non his march to Jena, but was thrust down into the abyss of his\r\ninscrutable will for a whole year, until Junot's march to Lisbon\r\nfurnished a safe means for effecting the subjugation of Spain. This\r\nend he thenceforth pursued unswervingly with no sign of remorse, or\r\neven of hesitation--unless we accept as genuine the almost certainly\r\nspurious letter of March 29th, 1808. That letter represents him as\r\nblaming Murat for entering Madrid, when he had repeatedly urged him to\r\ndo so; as asking his advice after he had all along kept him in\r\nignorance as to his aims; and as writing a philosophical homily on the\r\nunused energies of the Spanish people, for whom in his genuine letters\r\nhe expressed a lofty contempt.[192]\r\n\r\nThe whole enterprise is, indeed, a masterpiece of skill, but a\r\nmasterpiece marred by ineffaceable stains of treachery. And at the\r\nclose of his life, he himself said: \"I embarked very badly on the\r\nSpanish affair, I confess: the immorality of it was too patent, the\r\ninjustice too cynical, and the whole thing wears an ugly look since I\r\nhave fallen; for the attempt is only seen in its hideous nakedness\r\ndeprived of all majesty and of the many benefits which completed my\r\nintention.\"\r\n\r\nThat he hoped to reform Spain is certain. Political and social reforms\r\nhad hitherto consolidated the work of conquest; and those which he\r\nsoon offered to the Spaniards might possibly have renovated that\r\nnation, had they not been handed in at the sword's point; but the\r\nmotive was too obvious, the intervention too insulting, to render\r\nsuccess possible with the most sensitive people in Europe. On May 2nd\r\nhe wrote to Murat that he intended King Joseph of Naples to reign at\r\nMadrid, and offered to Murat either Portugal or Naples.[193] He chose\r\nthe latter. Joseph was allowed no choice in the matter. He was\r\nsummoned from Naples to Bayonne, and, on arriving at Pau, heard with\r\ngreat surprise that he was King of Spain.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's selection was tactful. At Naples, the eldest of the\r\nBonapartes had effected many reforms and was generally popular; but\r\nthe treachery of Bayonne blasted all hopes of his succeeding at\r\nMadrid. Though the grandees of Spain welcomed the new monarch with\r\ncourtly grace, though Charles IV. gave him his blessing, though\r\nFerdinand demeaned himself by advising his former subjects quietly to\r\nsubmit, the populace willed otherwise.\r\n\r\nEvery instinct of the Spanish nature was aflame with resentment.\r\nLoathing for Charles IV., his Queen, and their favourite, whom\r\nNapoleon richly dowered, love of the young King whom he falsely\r\nfilched away, detestation of the French troops who outraged the rights\r\nof hospitality, and zeal for the Roman Catholic Church, whose chief\r\nhad just been robbed of half his States, goaded the Spaniards to\r\nmadness. Their indignation rumbled hoarsely for a time, like a volcano\r\nin labour, and then burst forth in an explosion of fury. The\r\nconstitution which Napoleon presented to the Spanish Notables at\r\nBayonne was accepted by them, only to be flung back with scorn by the\r\npeople. The men of enlightenment who counselled prudence and patience\r\nwere slain by raging mobs or sought safety in flight. The rising was\r\nat once national in its grand spontaneity and local in its intensity.\r\nProvince after province rose in arms, except the north and centre,\r\nwhere 80,000 French troops held the patriots in check. In the van of\r\nthe movement was the rugged little province of Asturias, long ago the\r\nforlorn hope of the Christians in their desperate conflicts with the\r\nMoors. Intrenched behind their mountains and proud of their ancient\r\nfame, the Asturians ventured on the sublime folly of declaring war\r\nagainst the ruler of the West and the lord of 900,000 warriors.\r\nSwiftly Galicia and Leon in the north repeated the challenge; while in\r\nthe south, the fertile lands of Andalusia, Murcia, and Valencia\r\nflashed back from their mountains the beacon lights of a national war.\r\nThe former dislike of England was forgotten. The Juntas of Asturias,\r\nGalicia, and Andalusia sent appeals to us for help, to which Canning\r\ngenerously responded; and, on July 4th, we passed at a single bound\r\nfrom war with the Spanish Bourbons to an informal alliance with the\r\npeople of Spain.\r\n\r\nNapoleon now began to see the magnitude of his error. Instead of\r\ngaining control over Spain and the Indies, he had changed\r\nlong-suffering allies into irreconcilable foes. He prepared to conquer\r\nSpain. While Joseph was escorted to his new capital by a small army,\r\nNapoleon from Bayonne directed the operations of his generals. Holding\r\nthe northern road from Bayonne to Burgos and Madrid, they were to send\r\nout cautious feelers against the bands of insurgents; for, as Napoleon\r\nwrote to Savary (July 13th): \"In civil wars it is the important posts\r\nthat must be held: one ought not to go everywhere.\" Weighty words,\r\nwhich his lieutenants in Spain were often to disregard! Bessières in\r\nthe north gained a success at Medina de Rio Seco; but a signal\r\ndisaster in the south ruined the whole campaign. Dupont, after beating\r\nthe levies of Andalusia, penetrated into the heart of that great\r\nprovince, and, when cumbered with plunder, his divided forces were\r\nsurrounded, cut off from their supplies, and forced to surrender at\r\nBaylen--in all about 20,000 men (July 19th). The news that a French\r\narmy had laid down its arms caused an immense sensation in an age when\r\nNapoleon's troops were held to be invincible. Baylen was hailed\r\neverywhere by despairing patriots as the dawn of a new era. And such\r\nit was to be. If Valmy proclaimed the advent of militant democracy,\r\nthe victory of Spaniards over one of the bravest of Napoleon's\r\ngenerals was felt to be an even greater portent. It ushered in the\r\nepoch of national resistance to the overweening claims of the Emperor\r\nof the West.\r\n\r\nThat truth he seems dimly to have surmised. His rage on hearing of the\r\ncapitulation was at first too deep for words. Then he burst out:\r\n\"Could I have expected that from Dupont, a man whom I loved, and was\r\nrearing up to become a Marshal? They say he had no other way to save\r\nthe lives of his soldiers. Better, far better, to have died with arms\r\nin their hands. Their death would have been glorious: we should have\r\navenged them. You can always supply the place of soldiers. Honour\r\nalone, when once lost, can never be regained.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, the material consequences were considerable. The Spaniards\r\nspeedily threatened Madrid; and, on the advice of Savary, Joseph\r\nwithdrew from his capital after a week's sojourn, and fell back\r\nhurriedly on the line of the Upper Ebro, where the French rallied for\r\na second advance.\r\n\r\nTheir misfortunes did not end here. In the north-east the hardy\r\nCatalans had risen against the invaders, and by sheer pluck and\r\naudacity cooped them up in their ill-gotten strongholds of Barcelona\r\nand Figueras. The men of Arragon, too, never backward in upholding\r\ntheir ancient liberties, rallied to defend their capital Saragossa.\r\nTheir rage was increased by the arrival of Palafox, who had escaped in\r\ndisguise from the suite of Ferdinand at Bayonne, and brought news of\r\nthe treachery there perpetrated. Beaten outside their ancient city,\r\nand unable to hold its crumbling walls against the French cannon and\r\ncolumns of assault, the defenders yet fiercely turned to bay amidst\r\nits narrow lanes and massive monasteries. There a novel warfare was\r\nwaged. From street to street and house to house the fight eddied for\r\ndays, the Arragonese opposing to French valour the stubborn devotion\r\never shown by the peoples of the peninsula in defence of their walled\r\ncities, and an enthusiasm kindled by the zeal of their monks and the\r\nheroism of the Maid of Saragossa. Finally, on August 10th, the noble\r\ncity shook off the grip of the 15,000 assailants, who fell back to\r\njoin Joseph's forces higher up the Ebro.\r\n\r\nEven now the Emperor did not fully realize the serious nature of the\r\nwar that was beginning. Despite Savary's warnings of the dangers to be\r\nfaced in Spain, he persisted in thinking of it as an ordinary war that\r\ncould be ended by good strategy and a few victories. He censured\r\nJoseph and Savary for giving up the line of the Upper Douro: he blamed\r\nthem next for the evacuation of Tudela, and summed up the situation by\r\nstating that \"all the Spanish forces are not able to overthrow 25,000\r\nFrench in a reasonable position\"--adding, with stinging satire: \"In\r\nwar _men_ are nothing: it is _a man_ who is everything.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, at the close of August, Napoleon penned these memorable words in\r\nhis palace of St. Cloud, he knew not that a _man_ had arrived on the\r\nscene of action. At the beginning of that month, Sir Arthur Wellesley\r\nwith a British force of 12,300 men landed at the mouth of the River\r\nMondego, and, aided by Portuguese irregulars, began his march on\r\nLisbon. This is not the place for a review of the character and career\r\nof our great warrior: in truth, a volume would be too short for the\r\ntask. With fine poetic insight, Lord Tennyson has noted in his funeral\r\nOde the qualities that enabled him to overcome the unexampled\r\ndifficulties caused by our own incompetent Government and by jealous,\r\nexacting, and slipshod allies:\r\n\r\n  \"Mourn for the man of long-enduring blood,\r\n  The statesman-warrior, moderate, resolute,\r\n  Whole in himself, a common good.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGlory and vexation were soon to be his. On the 17th he drove the\r\nFrench vanguard from Roliça; and when, four days later, Junot hurried\r\nup with all his force, the British inflicted on that presumptuous\r\nleader a signal defeat at Vimiero. So bad were Junot's tactics that\r\nhis whole force would have been cut off from Torres Vedras, had not\r\nWellesley's senior officer, Sir Harry Burrard, arrived just in time to\r\ntake over the command and stop the pursuit. Thereupon Wellesley\r\nsarcastically exclaimed to his staff: \"Gentlemen, nothing now remains\r\nto us but to go and shoot red-legged partridges.\" The peculiarities of\r\nour war administration were further seen in the supersession of\r\nBurrard by Sir Hew Dalrymple, whose chief title to fame is his signing\r\nof the Convention of Cintra.\r\n\r\nBy this strange compact the whole of Junot's force was to be conveyed\r\nfrom Portugal to France on British ships, while the Russian squadron\r\nblockaded in the Tagus was to be held by us in pledge till the peace,\r\nthe crews being sent on to Russia. The convention itself was violently\r\nattacked by the English public; but it has found a defender in Napier,\r\nwho dwells on the advantages of getting the French at once out of\r\nPortugal, and thus providing a sure base for the operations in Spain.\r\nSeeing, however, that Junot's men were demoralized by defeat, and that\r\nthe nearest succouring force was in Navarre, these excuses seem\r\nscarcely tenable, except on the ground that, with such commanders as\r\nBurrard and Dalrymple, it was certainly desirable to get the French\r\nspeedily away.\r\n\r\nOn his side, Napoleon showed much annoyance at Junot's acceptance of\r\nthis convention, and remarked: \"I was about to send Junot to a council\r\nof war: but happily the English got the start of me by sending their\r\ngenerals to one, and thus saved me from the pain of punishing an old\r\nfriend.\" With his customary severity to those who had failed, he\r\nfrowned on all the officers of the Army of Portugal, and, on landing\r\nin France, they were strictly forbidden to come to Paris. The fate of\r\nDupont and of his chief lieutenants, who were released by the\r\nSpaniards, was even harder: on their return they were condemned to\r\nimprisonment. By such means did Napoleon exact the uttermost from his\r\ntroops, even in a service so detested as that in Spain ever was.[194]\r\n\r\nDespite the blunderings of our War Office, the silly vapourings of the\r\nSpaniards, and the insane quarrels of their provincial juntas about\r\nprecedence and the sharing of English subsidies, the summer of 1808\r\nsaw Napoleon's power stagger under terrible blows. Not only did he\r\nlose Spain and Portugal and the subsidies which they had meekly paid,\r\nbut most of the 15,000 Spanish troops which had served him on the\r\nshores of the Baltic found means to slip away on British ships and put\r\na backbone into the patriotic movements in the north of Spain. But\r\nworst of all was the loss of that moral strength, which he himself\r\nreckoned as three-fourths of the whole force in war. Hitherto he had\r\nalways been able to marshal the popular impulse on his side. As the\r\nheir to the Revolution he had appealed, and not in vain, to the\r\ndemocratic forces which he had hypnotized in France but sought to stir\r\nup in his favour abroad. Despite the efforts of Czartoryski and Stein\r\nto tear the democratic mask from his face, it imposed on mankind until\r\nthe Spanish Revolution laid bare the truth; and at St. Helena the\r\nexile gave his own verdict on the policy of Bayonne: \"It was the\r\nSpanish ulcer which ruined me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION.--For a careful account of the\r\n    Convention of Cintra in its military and political aspects, see\r\n    Mr. Oman's recently published \"History of the Peninsular War,\"\r\n    vol. i., pp. 268-278, 291-300. I cannot, however, agree with the\r\n    learned author that that Convention was justifiable on military\r\n    grounds, after so decisive a victory as Vimiero.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nERFURT\r\n\r\n    \"At bottom the great question is--who shall have\r\n    Constantinople?\"--NAPOLEON, May 31st, 1808.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Rising made an immense rent in Napoleon's plans. It opened\r\nvaluable markets for British goods both in the Peninsula and in South\r\nand Central America, and that too at the very time when the\r\nContinental System was about to enfold us in its deadly grip.[195] And\r\nfinally it disarranged schemes that reached far beyond Europe. To\r\nthese we must now briefly recur.\r\n\r\nEven amidst his greatest military triumphs Napoleon's gaze turned\r\nlongingly towards the East; and no sooner did he force peace on the\r\nconquered than his thoughts centred once more on his navy and\r\ncolonies, on Egypt and India. The Treaty of Tilsit gave him leisure to\r\nrenew these designs. The publication in 1807 of his official Atlas of\r\nAustralia, in which he claimed nearly half that continent for France,\r\nproves that he never accepted Trafalgar as a death-blow to his\r\nmaritime and colonial aspirations. And the ardour of his desire for\r\nthe conquest of India is seen in the letter which he wrote to the Czar\r\non February 2nd, 1808. After expressing his desire for the glory and\r\nexpansion of Russia, and advising the Czar to conquer Finland, he\r\nproceeds:\r\n\r\n    \"An army of 50,000 men, Russians, French, and perhaps a few\r\n    Austrians, that penetrated by way of Constantinople into Asia,\r\n    would not reach the Euphrates before England would tremble and bow\r\n    the knee before the Continent. I am ready in Dalmatia. Your\r\n    Majesty is ready on the Danube. A month after we came to an\r\n    agreement the army could be on the Bosporus.... By the 1st of May\r\n    our troops can be in Asia, and at the same time those of Your\r\n    Majesty, at Stockholm. Then the English, threatened in the Indies,\r\n    and chased from the Levant, will be crushed under the weight of\r\n    events with which the atmosphere will be charged.\"[196]\r\n\r\nThere were several reasons why Napoleon should urge on this scheme. He\r\nwas irritated by the continued resistance of Great Britain, and\r\nthought to terrify us into surrender by means of those oriental\r\nenterprises which convinced our statesmen that we must fight on for\r\ndear life. He also desired to restore the harmony of his relations\r\nwith Alexander. For, in truth, the rapturous harmonies of Tilsit had\r\nsoon been marred by discord. Alexander did not withdraw his troops\r\nfrom the Danubian provinces; whereupon Napoleon declined to evacuate\r\nSilesia; and the friction resulting from this wary balancing of\r\ninterests was increased, when, at the close of 1807, a formal proposal\r\nwas sent from Paris that, if Russia retained those provinces, Silesia\r\nshould be at the disposal of France.[197] The dazzling vistas opened\r\nup to Alexander's gaze at Tilsit were thus shrouded by a sordid and\r\ndistasteful bargain, which he hotly repelled. To repair this false\r\nstep, Napoleon now wrote the alluring letter quoted above; and the\r\nCzar exclaimed on perusing it: \"Ah, this is the language of Tilsit.\"\r\n\r\nYet, it may be questioned whether Napoleon desired to press on an\r\nimmediate partition of the Ottoman Power. His letter invited the Czar\r\nto two great enterprises, the conquest of Finland and the invasion of\r\nPersia and India. The former by itself was destined to tax Russia's\r\nstrength. Despite Alexander's offer of a perpetual guarantee for the\r\nFinnish constitution and customs, that interesting people opposed a\r\nstubborn resistance. Napoleon must also have known that Russia's\r\nforces were then wholly unequal to the invasion of India; and his\r\ninvitation to Alexander to engage in two serious enterprises certainly\r\nhad the effect of postponing the partition of Turkey. Delay was all in\r\nhis favour, if he was to gain the lion's share of the spoils. Russian\r\ntroops were ready on the banks of the Danube; but he was not as yet\r\nfully prepared. His hold on Dalmatia, Ragusa, and Corfu was not wholly\r\nassured. Sicily and Malta still defied him; and not until he seized\r\nSicily could he gain the control of the Mediterranean--\"the constant\r\naim of my policy.\" Only when that great sea had become a French lake\r\ncould he hope to plant himself firmly in Albania, Thessaly, Greece,\r\nCrete, Egypt, and Syria.\r\n\r\nFor the present, then, the Czar was beguiled with the prospect of an\r\neastern expedition; and, while Russian troops were overrunning\r\nFinland, Napoleon sought to conquer Sicily and reduce Spain to the\r\nrank of a feudatory State. From this wider point of view, he looked on\r\nthe Iberian Peninsula merely as a serviceable base for a greater\r\nenterprise, the conquest of the East. This is proved by a letter that\r\nhe wrote to Decrès, Minister of Marine and of the Colonies, from\r\nBayonne on May 17th, 1808, when the Spanish affair seemed settled:\r\n\"There is not much news from India. England is in great penury there,\r\nand the arrival of an expedition [from France] would ruin that colony\r\nfrom top to bottom. The more I reflect on this step, the less\r\ninconvenience I see in taking it.\" Two days later he wrote to Murat\r\nthat money must be found for naval preparations at the Spanish ports:\r\n\"I must have ships, for I intend striking a heavy blow towards the end\r\nof the season.\" But at the close of June he warned Decrès that as\r\nSpanish affairs were going badly, he must postpone his design of\r\ndespatching a fleet far from European waters.[198]\r\n\r\nSpain having proved to be, not a meek purveyor of fleets, but a\r\ndevourer of French armies, there was the more need of a close accord\r\nwith the Czar. Napoleon desired, not only to assure a further\r\npostponement of the Turkish enterprise, but also to hold Austria and\r\nGermany in check. The former Power, seeing Napoleon in difficulties,\r\npushed on apace her military organization; and Germany heaved with\r\nsuppressed excitement at the news of the Spanish Rising. The dormant\r\ninstinct of German nationality had already shown signs of awakening.\r\nIn the early days of 1808 the once cosmopolitan philosopher, Fichte,\r\ndelivered at Berlin within sound of the French drums his \"Addresses to\r\nthe German Nation,\" in which he dwelt on the unquenchable strength of\r\na people that determined at all costs to live free.\r\n\r\nOn the philosopher's theme the Spaniards now furnished a commentary\r\nwritten with their life-blood. Thinkers and soldiers were alike moved\r\nby the stories of Baylen and Saragossa. Varnhagen von Ense relates how\r\ndeep was the excitement of the quaint sage, Jean Paul Richter, who\r\n\"doubted not that the Germans would one day rise against the French as\r\nthe Spaniards had done, and that Prussia would revenge its insults and\r\ngive freedom to Germany.... I proved to him how hollow and weak was\r\nNapoleon's power: how deeply rooted was the opposition to it. The\r\nSpaniards were the refrain to everything, and we always returned to\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of a new civic life were then being laid in Prussia by\r\nStein. Called by the King to be virtually a civic dictator, this great\r\nstatesman carried out the most drastic reforms. In October, 1807,\r\nthere appeared at Memel the decrees of emancipation which declared the\r\nabolition of serfdom with all its compulsory and menial services. The\r\nold feudal society was further invigorated by the admission of all\r\nclasses to the holding of land or to any employment, while trade\r\nmonopolies were similarly swept away. Municipal self-government gave\r\nnew zest and energy to civic life; and the principle that the army\r\n\"ought to be the union of all the moral and physical energies of the\r\nnation\" was carried out by the military organizer Scharnhorst, who\r\nconceived and partly realized the idea that all able-bodied men should\r\nserve their time with the colours and then be drafted into a reserve.\r\nThis military reform excited Napoleon's distrust, and he forced the\r\nKing to agree by treaty (September, 1808) that the Prussian army\r\nshould never exceed 42,000 men, a measure which did not hinder the\r\nformation of an effective reserve, and was therefore complied with to\r\nthe letter, if not in spirit.\r\n\r\nIn fact, in the previous month a plan of a popular insurrection had\r\nbeen secretly discussed by Stein, Scharnhorst, and other patriotic\r\nMinisters. The example of the Spaniards was everywhere to be followed,\r\nand, if Austria sent forth her legions on the Danube and England\r\nhelped in Hanover, there seemed some prospect of shaking off the\r\nNapoleonic yoke. The scheme miscarried, and largely owing to the\r\ninterception of a letter in which Stein imprudently referred to the\r\nexasperation of public feeling in Germany and the lively hope excited\r\nby the events in Spain and the preparations of Austria. Napoleon\r\ncaused the letter to be printed in the \"Moniteur\" of September 8th,\r\nand sequestered Stein's property in Westphalia. He also kept his grip\r\non Prussia; for while withdrawing most of his troops from that\r\nexhausted land, he retained French garrisons in Stettin, Glogau, and\r\nKüstrin. Holding these fortresses on the strong defensive line of the\r\nOder, he might smile at the puny efforts of Prussian patriots and hope\r\nspeedily to crush the Spanish rebels, provided he could count on the\r\nloyal support of Alexander in holding Austria in check.\r\n\r\nTo gain this support and to clear away the clouds that bulked on their\r\noriental horizon, Napoleon urgently desired an interview with his\r\nally. For some months it had been proposed; but the Spanish Rising and\r\nthe armaments of Austria made it essential.\r\n\r\nThe meeting took place at Erfurt (September 27th). The Thuringian city\r\nwas ablaze with uniforms, and the cannon thundered salvoes of welcome\r\nas the two potentates and their suites entered the ancient walls and\r\nfiled through narrow streets redolent of old German calm, an abode\r\nmore suited to the speculations of a Luther than to the\r\nworld-embracing schemes of the Emperors of the West and East. With\r\nthem were their chief warriors and Ministers, personages who now threw\r\ninto the shade the new German kings. There, too, were the lesser\r\nGerman princes, some of them to grace the Court of the man who had\r\nshowered lands and titles on them, others to hint a wish for more\r\nlands and higher titles. In truth, the title of king was tantalizingly\r\ncommon; and if we may credit a story of the time, the French soldiery\r\nhad learnt to despise it. For, on one occasion, when the guard of\r\nhonour, deceived by the splendour of the King of Würtemberg's chariot,\r\nwas about to deliver the triple salute accorded only to the two\r\nEmperors, the officer in command angrily exclaimed: \"Be quiet: it's\r\nonly a king.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperors at Erfurt devoted the mornings to personal interviews,\r\nthe afternoons to politics, the evenings to receptions and the\r\ntheatre. The actors of the Comédie Française had been brought from\r\nParis, and played to the Emperors and a parterre of princes the\r\nmasterpieces of the French stage, especially those which contained\r\nsuitable allusions. A notable incident occurred on the recital of the\r\nline in the \"Oedipe\" of Voltaire:\r\n\r\n  \"L'amitié d'un grand homme est un bienfait des dieux.\"\r\n\r\nAs if moved by a sudden inspiration, Alexander arose and warmly\r\npressed the hand of Napoleon, who was then half-dozing at his\r\nside.[199] On the surface, indeed, everything was friendship and\r\nharmony. With urbane facility, the Czar accompanied his ally to the\r\nbattlefield of Jena, listened to the animated description of the\r\nvictor, and then joined in the chase in a forest hard by.\r\n\r\nBut beneath these brilliant shows there lurked suspicions and fears.\r\nAlexander was annoyed that Napoleon retained French garrisons in the\r\nfortresses on the Oder and claimed an impossible sum as indemnity from\r\nPrussia. This was not the restoration of Prussia's independence, for\r\nwhich he, Alexander, had pleaded; and while the French eagles were at\r\nKüstrin, the Russian frontier could not be deemed wholly safe.[200]\r\nThen again the Czar had been secretly warned by Talleyrand against\r\ncomplaisance to the French Emperor. \"Sire, what are you coming here\r\nfor? It is for you to save Europe, and you will only succeed in that\r\nby resisting Napoleon. The French are civilized, their sovereign is\r\nnot. The sovereign of Russia is civilized, her people are not.\r\nTherefore the sovereign of Russia must be the ally of the French\r\npeople.\"[201] We may doubt whether this symmetrical proposition would\r\nhave had much effect, if Alexander had not received similar warnings\r\nfrom his own ambassador at Paris; and it would seem that too much\r\nimportance has been assigned to what is termed Talleyrand's\r\n_treachery_ at Erfurt.[202] Affairs of high policy are determined, not\r\nso much by the logic of words as by the sterner logic of facts. Ever\r\nsince Tilsit, Napoleon had been prodigal of promises to his ally, but\r\nof little else. The alluring visions set forth in his letter of\r\nFebruary 2nd were as visionary as ever; and Romantzoff expressed the\r\nwish of his countrymen in his remark to Champagny: \"We have come to\r\nErfurt to set a limit to this conduct.\" It was evident that if\r\nNapoleon had his way completely, the partition of Turkey would take\r\nplace at the time and in the manner desired by him; this the Czar was\r\ndetermined to prevent, and therefore turned a deaf ear to his ally's\r\nproposal that they should summon Austria to explain her present\r\nambiguous behaviour and frankly to recognize Joseph Bonaparte as King\r\nof Spain. If Austria put a stop to her present armaments, the\r\nsupremacy of Napoleon in Central Europe would be alarmingly great.\r\nClearly it was not to Russia's interest to weaken the only\r\nbuffer-state that remained between her and the Empire of the West.\r\n\r\nThese fears were quietly fed by a special envoy of the Court of\r\nVienna, Baron Vincent, who brought complimentary notes to the two\r\nEmperors and remained to feel the pulse of European policy. It boded\r\npeace for Austria for the present. Despite Napoleon's eager arguments\r\nthat England would never make peace until Austria accepted the present\r\nsituation in Spain, Alexander quietly but firmly refused to take any\r\nsteps to depress the Hapsburg Power. The discussions waxed warm; for\r\nNapoleon saw that, unless the Court of Vienna were coerced, England\r\nwould persist in aiding the Spanish patriots; and Alexander showed an\r\nunexpected obstinacy. Napoleon's plea, that peace could only be\r\nassured by the entire discouragement of England, Austria, and the\r\nSpanish \"rebels,\" had no effect on him: in fact, he began to question\r\nthe sincerity of a peacemaker whose methods were war and intimidation.\r\nFinding arguments useless, Napoleon had recourse to anger. At the end\r\nof a lively discussion, he threw his cap on the ground and stamped on\r\nit. Alexander stopped, looked at him with a meaning smile, and said\r\nquietly: \"You are violent: as for me, I am obstinate: anger gains\r\nnothing from me: let us talk, let us reason, or I go.\" He moved\r\ntowards the door, whereupon Napoleon called him back--and they\r\nreasoned.\r\n\r\nIt was of no avail. Though Alexander left his ally a free hand in\r\nSpain, he refused to join him in a diplomatic menace to Austria; and\r\nNapoleon saw that \"those devilish Spanish affairs\" were at the root of\r\nthis important failure, which was to cost him the war on the Danube in\r\nthe following year.\r\n\r\nAs a set-off to this check, he disappointed Alexander respecting\r\nPrussia and Turkey. He refused to withdraw his troops from the\r\nfortresses on the Oder, and grudgingly consented to lower his\r\npecuniary claims on Prussia from 140,000,000 francs to 120,000,000.\r\nTowards the Czar's Turkish schemes he showed little more complaisance.\r\nAfter sharp discussions it was finally settled that Russia should gain\r\nthe Danubian provinces, but not until the following year. France\r\nrenounced all mediation between Alexander and the Porte, but required\r\nhim to maintain the integrity of all the other Turkish possessions,\r\nwhich meant that the partition of Turkey was to be postponed until it\r\nsuited Napoleon to take up his oriental schemes in earnest. The golden\r\nvisions of Tilsit were thus once more relegated to a distant future,\r\nand the keenness of the Czar's disappointment may be measured by his\r\nstriking statement quoted by Caulaincourt in one of his earlier\r\nreports from St. Petersburg: \"Let the world be turned upside down\r\nprovided that Russia gains Constantinople and the Dardanelles.\"[203]\r\n\r\nThe Erfurt interview left another hidden sore. It was there that the\r\ndivorce from Josephine was officially discussed, with a view to a more\r\nambitious alliance. Persistent as the rumours of a divorce had been\r\nfor seven years past, they seem to have emanated, not from the\r\nhusband, but from jealous sisters-in-law, intriguing relatives, and\r\nofficious Ministers. To the most meddlesome of these satellites,\r\nFouché, who had ventured to suggest to Josephine the propriety of\r\nsacrificing herself for the good of the State, Napoleon had lately\r\nadministered a severe rebuke. But now he caused Talleyrand and\r\nCaulaincourt to sound the Czar as to the feasibility of an alliance\r\nwith one of his sisters. The response was equally vague and discreet.\r\nAlexander expressed his gratification at the friendship which\r\nproffered such a request and his desire for the founding of a\r\nNapoleonic House. Further than this he did not go: and eight days\r\nafter his return to St. Petersburg his only marriageable sister,\r\nCatherine, was affianced to the heir to the Duchy of Oldenburg. This\r\nevent, it is true, was decided by the Dowager Empress; but no one,\r\nleast of all Napoleon, could harbour any doubts as to its\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nIn truth, Napoleon's chief triumphs at Erfurt were social and\r\nliterary. His efforts to dazzle German princes and denationalize two\r\nof her leading thinkers were partly successful. Goethe and Wieland\r\nbowed before his greatness. To the former Napoleon granted a lengthy\r\ninterview. He flattered the aged poet at the outset by the words, \"You\r\nare a man\": he then talked about several works in a way that Goethe\r\nthought very just; and he criticised one passage of the poet's\r\nyouthful work, \"Werther,\" as untrue to nature, with which Goethe\r\nagreed. On Voltaire's \"Mahomet\" he heaped censure, for its unworthy\r\nportraiture of the conqueror of the East and its ineffective fatalism.\r\n\"These pieces belong to an obscure age. Besides, what do they mean\r\nwith their fatalism? Politics is fatalism.\" The significance of this\r\nsaying was soon to be emphasized, so that misapprehension was\r\nimpossible. After witnessing Voltaire's \"La Mort de César,\" Napoleon\r\nsuggested that the poet ought to write a tragedy in a grander style\r\nthan Voltaire's, so as to show how the world would have benefited if\r\nthe great Roman had had time to carry out his vast plans.\r\n\r\nFinally, Goethe was invited to come to Paris, where he would find\r\nabundant materials for his poetic creations. Fortunately, Goethe was\r\nable to plead his age in excuse; and the world was therefore spared\r\nthe sight of a great genius saddled with an imperial commission and\r\nwriting a Napoleonized version of Cæsar's exploits and policy. But the\r\npressing character of the invitation reveals the Emperor's\r\ndissatisfaction with his French poetasters and his intention to\r\ndenationalize German literature. He had a dim perception that Teutonic\r\nidealism was a dangerous foe, inasmuch as it kept alive the sense of\r\nnationality which he was determined to obliterate. He was right. The\r\nlast and most patriotic of Schiller's works, \"Wilhelm Tell,\" the\r\nimpassioned discourses of Fichte, the efforts of the new patriotic\r\nleague, the Tugendbund, and last, but not least, the memory of the\r\nmurdered Palm, all these were influences that baffled bayonets and\r\ndiplomacy. Conquer and bargain as he might, he could not grapple with\r\nthe impalpable forces of the era that was now dawning. The younger\r\ngeneration throbbed responsive to the teachings of Fichte, the appeals\r\nof Stein, and the exploits of the Spaniards; it was blind to the\r\nsplendours of Erfurt: and it heard with grief, but with no change of\r\nconviction, that Goethe and Wieland had accepted from Napoleon the\r\ncross of the Legion of Honour, and that too on the anniversary of the\r\nBattle of Jena.\r\n\r\nAfter thus finally belittling the two poets, he shot a parting shaft\r\nat German idealism in his farewell to the academicians. He bade them\r\nbeware of idealogues as dangerous dreamers and disguised materialists.\r\nThen, raising his voice, he exclaimed: \"Philosophers plague themselves\r\nwith weaving systems: they will never find a better one than\r\nChristianity, which, reconciling man with himself, also assures public\r\norder and repose. Your idealogues destroy every illusion; and the time\r\nof illusions is for peoples and individuals alike the time of\r\nhappiness. I carry one away, that you will think kindly of me.\" He\r\nthen mounted his carriage and drove away to Paris to resume his\r\nconquest of Spain.[204]\r\n\r\nThe last diplomatic proceeding at Erfurt was the drawing up of a\r\nsecret convention which assigned Finland and the Danubian Provinces to\r\nRussia, and promised Russia's help to Napoleon in case Austria should\r\nattack him. The Czar also recognized Joseph Bonaparte as King of Spain\r\nand joined Napoleon in a joint note to George III. summoning him to\r\nmake peace. On the same day (October 12th) that note was drawn up and\r\ndespatched to London. In reply, Canning stated our willingness to\r\ntreat for peace, provided that it should include all parties: that,\r\nalthough bound by no formal treaty to Ferdinand VII. and the Spanish\r\npeople, yet we felt ourselves none the less pledged to them, and\r\npresumed that they, as well as our other allies, would be admitted to\r\nthe negotiations. Long before this reply reached Paris, Napoleon had\r\nleft for Spain. But on November 19th, he charged Champagny to state\r\nthat the Spanish rebels could no more be admitted than the Irish\r\ninsurgents: as for the other parties to the dispute he would not\r\nrefuse to admit \"either the King reigning in Sweden, or the King\r\nreigning in Sicily, or the King reigning in Brazil.\" This insulting\r\nreply sufficiently shows the insincerity of his overtures and the\r\npeculiarity of his views of monarchy. The Spaniards were rebels\r\nbecause they refused to recognize the forced abdication of their young\r\nKing; and the rulers of Sweden, Naples and Portugal, were Kings as\r\nlong as it suited Napoleon to tolerate them, and no longer. It is\r\nneedless to add that our Government refused to desert the Spaniards;\r\nand in his reply to St. Petersburg, Canning expressed George III.'s\r\ndeep regret that Alexander should sanction\r\n\r\n    \"An usurpation unparalleled in the history of the world.... If\r\n    these be the principles to which the Emperor of Russia has\r\n    inviolably attached himself ... deeply does His Majesty [George\r\n    III.] lament a determination by which the sufferings of Europe\r\n    must be aggravated and prolonged. But not to His Majesty is to be\r\n    attributed the continuance of the calamities of war, by the\r\n    disappointment of all hope of such a peace as would be compatible\r\n    with justice and honour.\"[205]\r\n\r\nNo open-minded person can peruse the correspondence on this subject\r\nwithout concluding that British policy, if lacking the breadth, grip\r\nand _finesse_ that marked that of France and Russia, yet possessed the\r\nsterling merits of manly truthfulness and staunch fidelity. The words\r\nquoted above were the words of Canning, but the spirit that animated\r\nthem was that of George III. His storm-tossed life was now verging\r\ntowards the dread bourne of insanity; but it was given to him to make\r\nthis stern yet half-pleading appeal to the Czar's better nature. And\r\nwho shall say that the example of constancy which the aged King\r\ndisplayed amidst the gathering gloom of his public and private life\r\ndid not ultimately bear fruit in the later and grander phase of\r\nAlexander's character and career?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Napoleon was bursting through the Spanish defence. The\r\npatriots, puffed up with their first successes, had been indulging in\r\ndreams of an invasion of France; and their provincial juntas\r\nquarrelled over the sharing of the future spoils as over the\r\napportionment of English arms and money. Their awakening was terrible.\r\nWith less than 90,000 raw troops they were attacked by 250,000 men led\r\nby the greatest warrior of the age. Everywhere they were routed, and\r\nat a last fight at the pass over the Somosierra mountain, the\r\nsuperiority of the French was strikingly shown. While the Spaniards\r\nwere pouring down grapeshot on the struggling masses of the\r\nassailants, the Emperor resolved to hurl his light Polish horse uphill\r\nat the death-dealing guns. Dashingly was the order obeyed. Some forty\r\nor fifty riders bit the dust, but the rest swept on, sabred the\r\ngunners, and decided the day. The Spaniards, amazed at these\r\nunheard-of tactics, took to their heels, and nothing now stayed\r\nNapoleon's entry into Madrid (December 4th). There he strove to\r\npopularize Joseph's rule by offering several desirable reforms, such\r\nas the abolition of feudal laws and of the Inquisition. It was of no\r\navail. The Spaniards would have none of them at his hands.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief stay in Madrid, he turned to crush Sir John Moore. That\r\nbrave soldier, relying on the empty promises of the patriots, had\r\nventured into the heart of Leon with a British force of 26,000 men. If\r\nhe could not save Madrid, he could at least postpone a French conquest\r\nof the south. In this he succeeded; his chivalrous daring drew on him\r\nthe chief strength of the invaders; and when hopelessly outnumbered he\r\nbeat a lion-like retreat to Corunna. There he turned and dealt the\r\nFrench a blow that closed his own career with glory and gained time\r\nfor his men to embark in safety.\r\n\r\nWhile the red-coats saw the snowy heights of Galicia fade into the\r\nsky, Napoleon was spurring back to the Pyrenees. He had received news\r\nthat portended war with Austria; and, cherishing the strange belief\r\nthat Spain was conquered, he rushed back to Paris to confront the\r\nHapsburg Power. But Spain was not conquered. Scattered her armies were\r\nin the open, and even brave Saragossa fell in glorious ruins under\r\nLannes' persistent attacks. But the patriots fiercely rallied in the\r\nmountains, and Napoleon was to find out the truth of the Roman\r\nhistorian's saying: \"In no land does the character of the people and\r\nthe nature of the country help to repair disasters more readily than\r\nin Spain.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another reason for Napoleon's sudden return. Rumours had\r\nreached him as to the _rapprochement_ of those usually envious rivals,\r\nTalleyrand and Fouché, who now walked arm in arm, held secret\r\nconclaves, and seemed to have some understanding with Murat. Were they\r\nplotting to bring this ambitious man and his still more ambitious and\r\nvindictive consort from the despised throne at Naples to seize on\r\npower at Paris while the Emperor was engulfed in the Spanish quagmire?\r\nA story ran that Fouché had relays of horses ready between Naples and\r\nParis for this enterprise.[206] But where Fouché and Talleyrand are\r\nconcerned, truth lurks at the bottom of an unfathomable well.\r\n\r\nAll that we know for certain is that Napoleon flew back to Paris in a\r\ntowering rage, and that, after sharply rebuking Fouché, he subjected\r\nthe Prince of Benevento to a violent tirade: just as he (Talleyrand)\r\nhad first advised the death of the Duc d'Enghien and then turned that\r\nevent to his sovereign's discredit, so now, after counselling the\r\noverthrow of the Spanish dynasty, he was making the same underhand use\r\nof the miscarriage of that enterprise. The Grand Chamberlain stood as\r\nif unmoved until the storm swept by, and then coldly remarked to the\r\nastonished circle: \"What a pity that so great a man has been so badly\r\nbrought up.\" Nevertheless, the insult rankled deep in his being, there\r\nto be nursed for five years, and then in the fullness of time to dart\r\nforth with a snake-like revenge. In 1814 and 1815 men saw that not the\r\nleast serious result of Napoleon's Spanish policy was the envenoming\r\nof his relations with the two cleverest of living Frenchmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION.--In the foregoing narrative, describing the\r\nbattle of the Somosierra, I followed the usually accepted account,\r\nwhich assigns the victory solely to the credit of the Polish horsemen.\r\nBut Mr. Oman has shown (\"History of the Peninsular War,\" vol. i., pp.\r\n459-461) that their first charge failed, and that only when a brigade\r\nof French infantry skirmished right up to the crest, did a second\r\neffort of the Poles, supported by cavalry of the Guard, secure the\r\npass. Napier's description (vol. i., p. 267), based on the French\r\nbulletin, is incorrect.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON AND AUSTRIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Never maltreat an enemy by halves\": such was the sage advice of\r\nPrussia's warrior King Frederick the Great, who instinctively saw the\r\nfolly of half measures in dealing with a formidable foe. The only\r\nstatesmanlike alternatives were, to win his friendship by generous\r\ntreatment, or to crush him to the earth so that he could not rise to\r\ndeal another blow.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, Napoleon deliberately took the perilous middle course\r\nwith the Hapsburgs after Austerlitz. He tore away from them their\r\nfaithful Tyrolese along with all their Swabian lands, and he half\r\ncrippled them in Italy by leaving them the line of the Adige instead\r\nof the Mincio. Later on, he compelled Austria to join the Continental\r\nSystem, to the detriment of her commerce and revenue; and his thinly\r\nveiled threats at Erfurt nerved her to strike home as soon as she saw\r\nhim embarked on the Spanish enterprise. She had some grounds for\r\nconfidence. The blows showered on the Hapsburg States had served to\r\nweld them more closely together; reforms effected in the\r\nadministration under the guidance of the able and high-spirited\r\nminister, Stadion, promised to reinvigorate the whole Empire; and army\r\nreforms, championed by the Archduke Charles, had shelved the petted\r\nincapables of the Court and opened up undreamt-of vistas of hope even\r\nto the common soldier. Moreover, it was certain that the Tyrolese\r\nwould revolt against the cast-iron Liberalism now imposed on them from\r\nMunich, which interfered with their cherished customs and church\r\nfestivals.\r\n\r\nThroughout Germany, too, there were widespread movements for casting\r\noff the yoke of Napoleon. The benefits gained by the adoption of his\r\nlaws were already balanced by the deepening hardships entailed by the\r\nContinental System; and the national German sentiment, which Napoleon\r\never sought to root out, persistently clung to Berlin and Vienna. A\r\nnew thrill of resentment ran through Germany when Napoleon launched a\r\ndecree of proscription against Stein, who had resigned office on\r\nNovember 24th. It was dated from Madrid (December 16th, 1808), and\r\nordered that \"the man named Stein,\" for seeking to excite troubles in\r\nGermany, should be held an enemy of France and the Confederation of\r\nthe Rhine, and suffer confiscation of his property and seizure of his\r\nperson, wherever he might be. The great statesman thereupon fled into\r\nAustria, where all the hopes of German nationalists now centred.[207]\r\n\r\nOn April the 6th the Archduke Charles issued a proclamation in which\r\nthe new hopes of reformed Austria found eloquent expression: \"The\r\nfreedom of Europe has sought refuge beneath your banners. Soldiers,\r\nyour victories will break her chains: your German brothers who are now\r\nin the ranks of the enemy wait for their deliverance.\" These hopes\r\nwere premature. Austria was too late or too soon: she was too late to\r\noverpower the Bavarians, or to catch the French forces leaderless, and\r\ntoo soon to gain the full benefit from her recent army reforms and\r\nfrom the diversion promised by England on the North Sea.[208] But our\r\nlimits of space render it impossible adequately to describe the course\r\nof the struggle on the Danube or of the Tyrolese rising.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, hurrying from Paris, found his forces spread out over a\r\nfront of sixty miles from Ratisbon to positions south of Augsburg, and\r\nit needed all his skill to mass them before the Archduke's blows fell.\r\nThanks to Austrian slowness the danger was averted, and a difficult\r\nretrograde movement was speedily changed into a triumphant offensive.\r\nFive successive days saw as many French victories, the chief of which,\r\nat Eckmühl (April 22nd), forced the Archduke with the Austrian right\r\nwing northwards towards Ratisbon, which was stormed on the following\r\nday, Charles now made for the Böhmer Wald, while his left wing on the\r\nsouth of the Danube fell back towards the Inn. Pushing his advantage\r\nto the utmost, the victor invaded Austria and forced Vienna to\r\nsurrender (May 13th).\r\n\r\nAt that city Napoleon issued (May 17th) a decree which reveals the\r\nexcess of his confidence. It struck down the temporal power of the\r\nPope, and annexed to the French Empire the part of the Papal States\r\nwhich he had spared the year before. The form of the decree was as\r\nremarkable as its substance. With an effrontery only equalled by its\r\nhistorical falsity, it cited the example of \"Charlemagne, my august\r\npredecessor, Emperor of the French\"; and, after exalting the Imperial\r\ndignity, it proceeded to lower the Popes to the position of Bishops of\r\nRome. The subordination of the spiritual to the civil power was also\r\nassured by the assigning of a yearly stipend of 2,000,000 francs to\r\nthe Pope.\r\n\r\nWhen Pius VII. protested against the seizure of his States, and hurled\r\na bull of excommunication at the spoliator, Napoleon issued orders\r\nwhich led to his arrest; and shortly after midsummer the unfortunate\r\npontiff was hurried away from Rome to Florence.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Napoleon had experienced an unlooked-for reverse. Though so\r\nfar cowed by his defeats in Bavaria as to send Napoleon a cringing\r\nrequest for peace, to which the victor deigned no reply, the Archduke\r\nCharles obstinately clung to the northern bank of the Danube opposite\r\nthe capital, and inflicted a severe defeat on the Emperor when the\r\nlatter sought to drive him from Aspern-Essling (May 21st-22nd). Had\r\nthe Austrian commander had that remorseless resolve which ever\r\nprompted Napoleon to wrest from Fortune her utmost favours, the\r\nwhite-coats might have driven their foes into the river; for at the\r\nclose of both of those days of carnage they had a clear advantage. A\r\nFrench disaster was in fact averted only by the combined efforts of\r\nNapoleon, Masséna, Lannes, and General Mouton; and even they were for\r\na time dismayed by the frightful losses, and by the news that the\r\nbridges, over which alone they could retire, had been swept away by\r\ntrees and barges sent down the flooded stream. But, as at Eylau,\r\nNapoleon's iron will imposed on his foes, and, under cover of\r\ndarkness, the French were withdrawn into the island of Lobau, after\r\nlosing some 25,000 men.[209]\r\n\r\nAmong them was that prince of vanguard leaders, Lannes. On hearing\r\nthat his old friend was mortally wounded, the Emperor hurried to him,\r\nand tenderly embraced him. The interview, says Marbot, who was\r\nsupporting the Marshal's shoulders, was most affecting, both these\r\nstern warriors displaying genuine emotion. And yet, it is reported\r\nthat, after Lannes was removed to Ebersdorf, his last words were those\r\nof reproach to the Emperor for his ambition. At that time, however,\r\nthe patient was delirious, and the words, if really uttered, were\r\nmeaningless; but the inventor of the anecdote might plead that it was\r\nconsonant with the recent tenor of the Marshal's thoughts. Like all\r\nthoughtful soldiers, who placed France before Napoleon, Lannes was\r\nweary of these endless wars. After Jena his heart was not in the work;\r\nand he wrote thus about Napoleon during the siege of Danzig: \"I have\r\nalways been the victim of my attachment to him. He only loves you by\r\nfits and starts, that is, when he has need of you.\" His presentiment\r\nwas true. He was a victim to a war that was the outcome solely of\r\nNapoleon's Continental System, and not of the needs of France. He\r\npassed away, leaving a brilliant military fame and a reputation for\r\nsoldierly republican frankness which was fast vanishing from the camps\r\nand _salons_ of the Empire.[210]\r\n\r\nAs yet, however, Napoleon's genius and the martial ardour of his\r\nsoldiers sufficed to overbear the halting efforts of Austria and her\r\nwell-wishers. On retiring into Lobau Island he put forth to the utmost\r\nhis extraordinary powers of organization. Boats brought vast supplies\r\nof stores and ammunition from Vienna, which the French still held. The\r\nmenacing front of Masséna and Davoust imposed on the enemy.\r\nReinforcements were hurried up from Bavaria. Tyrol was denuded of\r\nFranco-Bavarian troops, so that the peasants, under the lead of the\r\nbrave innkeeper, Hofer, were able to organize a systematic defence.\r\nAnd a French army which had finally beaten the Austrians in Venetia,\r\nnow began to drive them back into Hungary. In Poland the white-coats\r\nwere held in check, and the Franco-Russian compact deterred Frederick\r\nWilliam from making any move against France such as Prussian patriots\r\nardently counselled.\r\n\r\nTo have done so would have been madness, unless England sent powerful\r\naid on the side of Hanover; and that aid was not forthcoming. Yet the\r\npatriotic ardour of the Germans led to two daring efforts against the\r\nFrench. Schill, with a Prussian cavalry regiment, sought to seize\r\nMagdeburg, and failing there moved north in hopes of British help. His\r\nadventurous ride was ended by Napoleon's Dutch and North German\r\ntroops, who closed in on him at Stralsund, and, on May 31st, cut to\r\npieces his brave troop. Schill met a warrior's death: most of the\r\nsurvivors were sent to the galleys in France. Undeterred by this\r\nfailure, the young Duke of Brunswick sought to rouse Saxony and\r\nWestphalia by a dashing cavalry raid (June); but, beyond showing the\r\nweakness of Jerome Bonaparte's rule and the general hatred of the\r\nFrench, he effected little: with his 2,000 followers he was finally\r\nsaved by British cruisers (August). Had the British expedition, which\r\nin the ensuing autumn rotted away on Walcheren, been landed at\r\nStralsund, or in Hanover during the spring, it is certain that Germany\r\nwould have risen in Napoleon's rear; and in that case, the doubtful\r\nstruggle which closed at Wagram might have ended very\r\ndifferently.[211]\r\n\r\nAll hopes for European independence centred in Wellesley and the\r\nArchduke Charles. Although there was no formal compact between England\r\nand Austria, yet the Hapsburgs rested their hopes largely on the\r\ndiversions made by our troops. In the early part of the Peninsular\r\ncampaign of 1809, these hopes were brilliantly fulfilled. Wellesley\r\nmoved against Soult at Oporto, and, by a dextrous crossing of that\r\nriver in his rear, compelled him to beat a calamitous retreat on\r\nSpain, with the loss of all his cannon and stores. The French reached\r\nLugo an armed rabble, and were greeted there with jeers and\r\nexecrations by the men of Ney's corps. The two Marshals themselves\r\ntook up the quarrel, and so fierce were the taunts of Ney that Soult\r\ndrew his sword and a duel was barely averted.[212] An appearance of\r\nconcord was restored during their operations in Galicia and Asturias:\r\nbut no opportunity was missed of secretly thwarting the hated rival;\r\nand here, as all through the Peninsular War, the private jealousies of\r\nthe French leaders fatally compromised the success of their arms.\r\nWellesley, seeing that the operations in Galicia would never decide\r\nthe war, began to prepare a deadly blow at the centre of French\r\nauthority, Madrid.\r\n\r\nWhile Wellesley thrust a thin wedge into the heart of Spain, the\r\nArchduke Charles was overthrown on the banks of the Danube. After\r\ndrawing in reinforcements from France, the Rhenish Confederation, and\r\nEugène's army of Italy, the French Emperor disposed of 180,000\r\nhighly-trained troops, whom he massed in the Lobau Island, or on the\r\nright shore of the Danube. Every preparation was made for deceiving\r\nthe Austrians as to the point of crossing and with complete success.\r\nWith great labour the defenders threw up intrenchments facing the\r\nnorth side of the island. But, on a thick stormy night (July 4th), six\r\nbridges of boats were quickly swung across the stream lower down, that\r\nis, on the east side of Lobau, while a furious cannonade on the north\r\nside misled their foes. The crossing was effected without loss by\r\nOudinot and Masséna; and sunrise saw the whole French army advancing\r\nrapidly northwards, thereby outflanking the Austrian earthworks, which\r\nwere now evacuated.\r\n\r\nCharles was outmanoeuvred and outnumbered. His brother, the Archduke\r\nJohn, was at Pressburg with 20,000 men, watched hitherto by Davoust.\r\nBut the French Marshal cleverly withdrew his corps, leaving only\r\nenough men to impose on that unenterprising leader. Other Austrian\r\ndetachments were also far away at the critical time, and thus Napoleon\r\nhad a superiority of force of about 50,000 men. Nevertheless, the\r\ndefence at Wagram was most obstinate (July 6th). Holding his own on\r\nthe hills behind the Russbach, the Archduke swung forward his right in\r\nsuch strength as to drive back Masséna on Aspern; but his weakened\r\ncentre was now pushed back and endangered by the persistent vigour of\r\nMacdonald's onset. This success at the centre gave time for Davoust to\r\nwrest Neusiedel from the white-coats, a movement which would have been\r\nstopped or crushed, had the Archduke John obeyed his brother's orders\r\nand marched from the side of Pressburg on Napoleon's unguarded right\r\nflank. Finally, after an obstinate stand, the Austrians fell back in\r\ngood order, effectively covering their retreat by a murderous\r\nartillery fire. A total loss of some 50,000 men, apportioned nearly\r\nequally on either side, was the chief result of this terrible day. It\r\nwas not remarkable for brilliant tactics; and, as at Aspern, the\r\nAustrians fully equalled their foes in courage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WAGRAM]\r\n\r\nSuch was the battle of Wagram, one of the greatest of all time, if the\r\nnumber of combatants be counted, but one of the least decisive in its\r\nstrictly military results. If we may compare Austerlitz with Blenheim,\r\nWagram may with equal fitness be matched with the vast slaughter of\r\nMalplaquet exactly a century before. The French now felt the hardening\r\nof the national defence of Austria and the falling off in their own\r\nfighting powers. Marmont tells how, at the close of the day, the\r\napproach of the Archduke John's scouts struck panic into the\r\nconquerors, so that for a time the plain on the east was covered with\r\nrunaway conscripts and disconcerted plunderers. The incident proved\r\nthe deterioration of the Grand Army from the times of Ulm and Jena.\r\nRaw conscripts raised before their time and hurriedly drafted into the\r\nline had impaired its steadiness, and men noted as another ominous\r\nfact that few unwounded prisoners were taken from the Austrians, and\r\nonly nine guns and one colour. In fact, the only reputation enhanced\r\nwas that of Macdonald, who for his great services at the centre\r\nenjoyed the unique honour of receiving a Marshal's bâton from Napoleon\r\non the field of battle.\r\n\r\nHad the Archduke Charles been made of the same stuff as Wellington,\r\nthe campaign might still have been retrieved. But softness and\r\nirresolution were the characteristics of Austria's generals no less\r\nthan of her rulers.[213] The Hapsburg armies were still led with the\r\nold leisurely _insouciance_; and their counsels swayed to and fro\r\nunder the wavering impulses of a seemingly decrepit dynasty. Francis\r\nhad many good qualities: he was a good husband and father, and his\r\nkindly manners endeared him to the Viennese even in the midst of\r\ndefeat. But he was capricious and shortsighted; anything outside of\r\nthe well-worn ruts of routine vexed and alarmed him; and it is a\r\nsupreme proof of the greatness and courage of his reforming Minister,\r\nStadion, that his innovations should have been tolerated for so long.\r\nNow that disasters were shaking his throne he began to suspect the\r\nreformer; and Stadion confessed to the publicist, Gentz, that it was\r\nimpossible to reckon on the Emperor for a quarter of an hour together,\r\nunless one stayed by him all the twenty-four hours.--\"After a great\r\ndefeat, he will take himself off at once and will calmly commend us to\r\nGod.\"--This was what now happened. Another failure at Znaim so daunted\r\nthe Archduke that he sued for an armistice (July 12th). For this there\r\nwas some excuse. The latest news both from Spain and Prussia inspired\r\nthe hope that, if time were gained, important diversions might be made\r\nin both quarters.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, Sir Arthur Wellesley opened the campaign with a\r\nbrilliant success, and then prepared to strike at the heart of the\r\nFrench power. The memorable campaign of Talavera was the result.\r\nRelying on promises of aid from the Spanish Junta and from their\r\ncross-grained commander, Cuesta, he led a small British force up the\r\nvalley of the Tagus to seize Madrid, while the chief French armies\r\nwere engaged in distant provinces. In one sense he achieved his aim.\r\nHe compelled the enemy to loose their hold on those provinces and\r\nconcentrate to save the capital. And before they fully effected their\r\nconcentration, he gave battle to King Joseph and Marshals Jourdan and\r\nVictor at Talavera (July 28th). Skilfully posting the Spaniards behind\r\nintrenchments and in gardens where their raw levies could fight with\r\nevery advantage, he extended his thin red lines--he had only 17,000\r\nBritish troops--along a ridge stretching up to a plateau that\r\ndominated the broken ground north of the town. On that hill Wellesley\r\nplanted his left: and all the efforts of Victor to turn that wing or\r\nto break it by charges across the intervening ravine were bloodily\r\nbeaten off.\r\n\r\nThe fierce heat served but to kindle French and British to greater\r\nfury. Finally, the dashing charge of our 23rd dragoons and the\r\nirresistible advance of the 48th regiment of foot overthrew the\r\nenemy's centre; and as the day waned, the 30,000 French retired, with\r\na loss of 17 cannon and of 7,000 men in killed, wounded, and\r\nprisoners. Had the other Spanish armies now offered the support which\r\nWellesley expected, he would doubtless have seized Madrid. He had\r\nwritten three days before Talavera: \"With or without a battle we shall\r\nbe at Madrid soon.\" But his allies now failed him utterly: they did\r\nnot hold the mountain passes which confronted Soult in his march from\r\nSalamanca into the valley of the Tagus; and they left the British\r\nforces half starving.--\"We are here worse off than in a hostile\r\ncountry,\" wrote our commander; \"never was an army so ill used: we had\r\nno assistance from the Spanish army: we were obliged to unload our\r\nammunition and our treasure in order to employ the cars in the removal\r\nof our sick and wounded.\" Meanwhile Soult, with 50,000 men, was\r\nthreading his way easily through the mountains and threatened to cut\r\nus off from Portugal: but by a rapid retreat Wellesley saved his army,\r\nvowing that he would never again trust Spanish offers of help.[214]\r\n\r\nFar more dispiriting was the news that reached the Austrian\r\nnegotiators from the North Sea. There the British Government succeeded\r\nin eclipsing all its former achievements in forewarning foes and\r\ndisgusting its friends. Very early in the year, the men of Downing\r\nStreet knew that Austria was preparing to fight Napoleon and built her\r\nhopes of success, partly on the Peninsular War, partly on a British\r\ndescent in Hanover, where everything was ripe for revolution.\r\nUnfortunately, we were still, formally, at war with her: and the\r\nconclusion of the treaty of peace was so long delayed at Vienna that\r\nJuly was almost gone before the Austrian ratification reached London,\r\nand our armada set sail from Dover.[215] The result is well known.\r\nOfficial favouritism handed over the command of 40,000 troops to the\r\nEarl of Chatham, who wasted precious days in battering down the walls\r\nof Flushing when he should have struck straight at the goal now aimed\r\nat, Antwerp. That fortress was therefore ready to beat him off; and he\r\nfinally withdrew his army into the Isle of Walcheren, into whose\r\nfever-laden swamps Napoleon had refused to send a single French\r\nsoldier. A tottering remnant was all that survived by the close of the\r\nyear: and the climax of our national disgrace was reached when a\r\ncourt-martial acquitted the commanders. Napoleon would have had them\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nHelpless as the old monarchies were to cope with Napoleon, a wild\r\nlonging for vengeance was beginning to throb among the peoples. It\r\nshowed itself in a remarkable attempt on his life during a review at\r\nSchönbrunn. A delicate youth named Staps, son of a Thuringian pastor,\r\nmade his way to the palace, armed with a long knife, intending to stab\r\nhim while he read a petition (October 12th). Berthier and Rapp, noting\r\nthe lad's importunity, had him searched and brought before Napoleon.\r\n\"What did you mean to do with that knife?\" asked the Emperor. \"Kill\r\nyou,\" was the reply. \"You are an idiot or an Illuminat.\" \"I am not an\r\nidiot and do not know what an Illuminat is.\" \"Then you are diseased.\"\r\n\"No, I am quite well.\" \"Why do you wish to kill me?\" \"Because you are\r\nthe curse of my Fatherland.\" \"You are a fanatic; I will forgive you\r\nand spare your life.\" \"I want no forgiveness.\" \"Would you thank me if\r\nI pardoned you?\" \"I would seek to kill you again.\" The quiet firmness\r\nwith which Staps gave these replies and then went to his doom made a\r\ndeep impression on Napoleon; and he sought to hurry on the conclusion\r\nof peace with these odd Germans whom he could conquer but not\r\nconvince.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Francis was now resigned to his fate, but he refused to\r\nhear of giving up his remaining sea-coast in Istria. On this point\r\nMetternich strove hard to bend Napoleon's will, but received as a\r\nfinal answer: \"Then war is unavoidable.\"[216] In fact, the victor knew\r\nthat Austria was in his power. The Archduke Charles had thrown up his\r\ncommand, the soldiery were depressed, and a great part of the Empire\r\nwas in the hands of the French. England's efforts had failed; and of\r\nall the isolated patriotic movements in Germany only that of the\r\nTyrolese mountaineers still struggled on. Napoleon could therefore\r\ndictate his own terms in the Treaty of Schönbrunn (October 14th),\r\nwhich he announced as complete, when as yet Francis had not signed\r\nit.[217] Austria thereby recognized Joseph as King of Spain, and ceded\r\nSalzburg and the Inn-viertel to Napoleon, to be transferred by him to\r\nBavaria. To the French Empire she yielded up parts of Austrian Friuli\r\nand Carinthia, besides Carniola, the city and district of Trieste, and\r\nportions of Croatia and Dalmatia to the south of the River Save. Her\r\nspoils of the old Polish lands now went to aggrandize the Duchy of\r\nWarsaw, a small strip of Austrian Gallicia also going to Russia.\r\nBesides losing 3,500,000 subjects, Austria was mulcted in an indemnity\r\nof £3,400,000, and again bound herself to exclude all British\r\nproducts. By a secret clause she agreed to limit her army to 150,000\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the severest loss was the abandonment of the faithful\r\nTyrolese. After Aspern, the Emperor Francis promised that he would\r\nnever lay down his arms until they were re-united with his Empire.\r\nThis promise now went the way of the many fond hopes of reform and\r\nchampionship of German nationality which her ablest men had lately\r\ncherished, and the Empire settled down in torpor and bankruptcy. In\r\ndumb wrath and despair Austrian patriots looked on, while the Tyrolese\r\nwere beaten down by French, Bavarian, and Italian forces. Hofer\r\nfinally took to the hills, was betrayed by a friend, and was taken to\r\nMantua. Some of the officers who there tried him desired to spare his\r\nlife, but a special despatch of Napoleon[218] ordered his execution,\r\nand the brave mountaineer fell, with the words on his lips: \"Long live\r\nthe Emperor Francis.\" Tyrol, meanwhile, was parcelled out between\r\nBavaria, Illyria, and the Kingdom of Italy; but bullets and partitions\r\nwere of no avail against the staunch patriotism of her people, and the\r\nTyrolese campaign boded ill for Napoleon if monarchs, generals, and\r\nstatesmen should ever be inspired by the sturdy faith and hardihood of\r\nthat noble peasantry.\r\n\r\nAs yet, however, prudence and timidity reigned supreme. Though the\r\nCzar uttered some snappish words at the threatening increase to the\r\nDuchy of Warsaw, he still posed as Napoleon's ally. The Swedes, weary\r\nof their hopeless strifes with France, Russia, and Denmark, deposed\r\nthe still bellicose Gustavus IV.; and his successor, Charles XIII.,\r\nmade peace with those Powers, retaining Swedish Pomerania, but only at\r\nthe cost of submitting to the Continental System. Prussia seemed, to\r\nofficial eyes, utterly cowed. The Hapsburgs, having failed in their\r\nbold championship of the cause of reform and of German nationality,\r\nnow fell back into a policy marked by timid opportunism and decorously\r\ndull routine.\r\n\r\nThe change was marked by the retirement of Stadion, a man whose\r\nenterprising character, no less than his enthusiasm for reform, ill\r\nfitted him for the time of compromise and subservience now at hand. He\r\nit was who had urged Austria forward in the paths of progress and had\r\nsought safety in the people: he was the Stein of Austria. But now, on\r\nthe eve of peace, he earnestly begged to be allowed to resign the\r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs; and the Emperor Francis thereupon\r\nsummoned to that seemingly thankless office a young diplomatist, who\r\nwas destined to play a foremost part in the mighty drama of Napoleon's\r\noverthrow, and thereafter to wield by his astute policy almost as\r\ngreat an influence in Central and Southern Europe as the autocrat\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nMetternich was born at Coblentz in 1773, and was therefore four years\r\nthe junior of Napoleon. He came of an old family of the Rhineland, and\r\nhis father's position in the service of the old Empire secured him\r\nearly entrance into the diplomatic circle. After acting as secretary\r\nto the Imperial delegates at the Congress of Rastatt, he occupied the\r\npost of Austrian ambassador successively at the Courts of Dresden and\r\nBerlin; and in 1806 he was suddenly called to take up the embassy in\r\nParis. There he displayed charms of courtly tact, and lively and\r\neloquent conversation, which won Napoleon's admiration and esteem. He\r\nwas looked on as a Gallophil; and, like Bismarck at a later crisis, he\r\nused his social gifts and powers of cajolery so as to gain a correct\r\nestimate of the characters of his future opponents.\r\n\r\nYet, besides these faculties of finesse and intrigue--and the Miltonic\r\nBelial never told lies with more winsome grace--Metternich showed at\r\ntimes a manly composure and firmness, even when Napoleon unmasked a\r\nsearching fire of diplomatic questions and taunts. Of this he had\r\ngiven proof shortly before the outbreak of the late war, and his\r\nconduct had earned the thanks of the other ambassadors for giving the\r\nFrench Emperor a lesson in manners, while the autocrat liked him none\r\nthe less, but rather the more, for standing up to him. But now, after\r\nthe war, all was changed; craft was more serviceable than fortitude;\r\nand the gay Rhinelander brought to the irksome task of subservience to\r\nthe conqueror a courtly _insouciance_ under which he nursed the hope\r\nof ultimate revenge.--\"From the day when peace is signed,\" he wrote to\r\nthe Emperor Francis on August 10th, 1809, \"we must confine our system\r\nto tacking and turning, and flattering. Thus alone may we possibly\r\npreserve our existence, till the day of general deliverance.\"[219]\r\nThis was to be the general drift of Austrian policy for the next four\r\nyears; and it may be granted that only by bending before the blast\r\ncould that sore-stricken monarchy be saved from destruction. An\r\nopportunity soon occurred of carrying the new system into effect.\r\nMetternich offered the conqueror an Austrian Archduchess as a bride.\r\n\r\nAfter the humiliation of the Hapsburgs and of the Spanish patriots,\r\nnothing seemed wanting to Napoleon's triumph but an heir who should\r\nfound a durable dynasty. This aim was now to be reached. As soon as\r\nthe Emperor returned to Paris, his behaviour towards Josephine showed\r\na marked reserve. The passage communicating between their private\r\napartments was closed, and the gleams of triumphant jealousy that\r\nflashed from her sisters-in-law warned Josephine of her approaching\r\ndoom. The divorce so long bruited by news-mongers was at hand. The\r\nEmperor broke the tidings to his consort in the private drawing-room\r\nof the Tuileries on November 30th, and strove to tone down the\r\nharshness of his decision by basing it on the imperative needs of the\r\nState. But she spurned the dictates of statecraft. With all her\r\nfaults, she was affectionate and tender; she was a woman first and an\r\nEmpress afterwards; she now clung to Napoleon, not merely for the\r\nsplendour of the destiny which he had opened to her, but also from\r\ngenuine love.\r\n\r\nTheir relations had curiously changed. At the outset she had slighted\r\nhis mad devotion by her shallow coldness and occasional infidelities,\r\nuntil his lava-like passion petrified. Thenceforth it was for her to\r\nwoo, and woo in vain. For years past she had to bemoan the waning of\r\nhis affection and his many conjugal sins. And now the chasm, which she\r\nthought to have spanned by the religious ceremony on the eve of the\r\ncoronation, yawned at her feet. The woman and the Empress in her\r\nshrank back from the black void of the future; and with piteous\r\nreproaches she flung back the orders of the Emperor and the soothings\r\nof the husband. Napoleon, it would seem, had nerved himself against\r\nsuch an outbreak. In vain did Josephine sink down at his feet with\r\nheart-rending cries that she would never survive the disgrace: failing\r\nto calm her himself, he opened the door and summoned the prefect of\r\nthe palace, Bausset, and bade him bear her away to her private\r\napartments. Down the narrow stairs she was borne, the Emperor lifting\r\nher feet and Bausset supporting her shoulders, until, half fainting,\r\nshe was left to the sympathies of her women and the attentions of\r\nCorvisart. But hers was a wound that no sympathy or skill could\r\ncure.[220]\r\n\r\nOn his side, Napoleon felt the wrench. Not only the ghost of his early\r\nlove, but his dislike of new associates and novel ways cried out\r\nagainst the change. \"In separating myself from my wife,\" Napoleon once\r\nsaid to Talleyrand, \"I renounce much. I should have to study the\r\ntastes and habits of a young woman. Josephine accommodates herself to\r\neverything: she understands me perfectly.\"[221] But his boundless\r\ntriumphs, his alliance with the Czar and total overthrow of the\r\nBourbons and the Pope, had fed the fires of his ambition. He aspired\r\nto give the _mot d'ordre_ to the universe; and he scrupled not to put\r\naside a consort who could not help him to found a dynasty. Yet it was\r\nnot without pangs of sorrow and remorse. His laboured, panting breath\r\nand almost gasping words left on Bausset the impression that he was\r\ngenuinely affected; and, consummate actor though he was, we may well\r\nbelieve that he felt the parting from his early associations.\r\nUnderneath his generally cold exterior he hid a nervous nature,\r\ndominated by an inflexible will, but which now and again broke through\r\nall restraint, bathing the beloved object with sudden tenderness or\r\nblasting a foe with fiery passion. And it would seem that Josephine's\r\npangs had power to reawaken the feelings of his more generous youth.\r\nThe ceremony of divorce took place on December 15th Josephine\r\ndeclaring with agonized pride that she gave her assent for the welfare\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nAlready the new marriage negotiations had begun. They are unique even\r\namidst the frigid annals of royal betrothals. The French ambassador,\r\nCaulaincourt, was charged to make definite overtures at St. Petersburg\r\nfor the hand of the Czar's younger sister; the conditions could easily\r\nbe arranged; religion need be no difficulty; but time was pressing;\r\nthe Emperor had need of an heir; \"we are counting the minutes here,\"\r\nran the despatch; and an answer was expected from St. Petersburg after\r\nan interval of _two days_.[222] The request caused Alexander the\r\ngreatest perplexity. He parried it with the reply, correct enough in\r\nform as in fact, that the disposal of his sister rested with the\r\nDowager Empress. But her hostility to Napoleon was well known. After\r\nthe half overtures of Erfurt she had at once betrothed her elder\r\ndaughter to the Duke of Oldenburg. No similar escape was now possible\r\nfor the younger one: but, after leaving Napoleon's request unanswered\r\nuntil February 4th, the reply was then despatched that the tender age\r\nof the princess, she being only twenty years old, formed an\r\ninsuperable obstacle.\r\n\r\nSome such answer had long been expected at Paris. Metternich asserts\r\nin his \"Memoirs\" that Napoleon had caused Laborde, one of his\r\ndiplomatic agents at Vienna, tentatively to sound that Court as to his\r\nbetrothal with the Archduchess Marie Louise. But the French archives\r\nshow that the first hint came from Metternich, who saw in it a means\r\nof weakening the Franco-Russian alliance and saving Austria from\r\nfurther disasters.[223] A little later the Countess Metternich was at\r\nParis; and great was her surprise when, on January 2nd, 1810,\r\nJosephine informed her that she favoured a marriage between Napoleon\r\nand Marie Louise. \"I spoke to him of it yesterday,\" she said; \"his\r\nchoice is not yet fixed; but he thinks that this would be his choice\r\nif he were sure of its being accepted.\" Thereafter the Countess\r\nreceived the most flattering attentions at Court, a proof that the\r\nHapsburg match was now favoured, even though the coyness of the Czar\r\nwas as yet unknown.\r\n\r\nAt the close of January a Privy Council was held at the Tuileries to\r\ndecide on the imperial bride. The votes were nearly equal: four voted\r\nfor Austria, four for Saxony, and three for Russia. After listening\r\nquietly to the arguments, Napoleon summed up the discussion by\r\npronouncing firmly and warmly in favour of Austria. The marriage\r\ncontract was therefore drawn up on February 7th; and Berthier was\r\ndespatched to Vienna to claim the hand of Marie Louise. He entered\r\nthat city over the ruins of the old ramparts, which were now being\r\ndismantled in accordance with the French demands.\r\n\r\nThe marriage took place at Vienna by proxy; the bride was conducted to\r\nParis; and the final ceremony took place at Notre Dame on April 2nd,\r\nbut not until the union had been consummated. Such were Napoleon's\r\nsecond wooing and wedding. Nevertheless, he showed himself an\r\nattentive and even indulgent spouse, and he remarked at St. Helena\r\nthat if Josephine was all grace and charm, Marie Louise was innocence\r\nand nature herself.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian marriage was an event of the first importance. It gained\r\na few years' respite for the despairing Hapsburgs, and gave tardy\r\nsatisfaction to Talleyrand's statesmanlike scheme of a Franco-Austrian\r\nalliance which should be in the best sense conservative. Had Napoleon\r\ntaken this step after Austerlitz in the way that his counsellor\r\nadvised, possibly Europe might have reached a condition of stable\r\nequilibrium, always provided that he gave up his favourite scheme of\r\npartitioning Turkey. But that was not to be; and when Austria finally\r\nyielded up Marie Louise as an unpicturesque Iphigenia on the marriage\r\naltar, she did so only as a desperate device for appeasing an\r\ninexorable destiny. And, strange to say, she succeeded. For Alexander\r\ntook offence at the marriage negotiations; and thus was opened a\r\nbreach in the Franco-Russian alliance which other events were rapidly\r\nto widen, until Western and Central Europe hurled themselves against\r\nthe East, and reached Moscow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE EMPIRE AT ITS HEIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nNapoleon's star had now risen to its zenith. After his marriage with a\r\ndaughter of the most ancient of continental dynasties, nothing seemed\r\nlacking to his splendour. He had humbled Pope and Emperor alike:\r\nGermany crouched at his feet: France, Italy, and the Confederation of\r\nthe Rhine gratefully acknowledged the benefits of his vigorous sway:\r\nthe Czar was still following the lead given at Erfurt: Sweden had\r\nsuccumbed to the pressure of the two Emperors: and Turkey survived\r\nonly because it did not yet suit Napoleon to shear her asunder: he\r\nmust first complete the commercial ruin of England and drive\r\nWellington into the sea. Then events would at last be ripe for the\r\noriental schemes which the Spanish Rising had postponed.\r\n\r\nHe might well hope that England's strength was running out: near the\r\nclose of 1810 the three per cent. consols sank to sixty-five, and the\r\ndeclared bankruptcies averaged 250 a month. The failure of the\r\nWalcheren expedition had led to terrible loss of men and treasure, and\r\nhad clouded over the reputation of her leaders. After mutual\r\nrecriminations Canning and Castlereagh resigned office and fought a\r\nduel. Shortly afterwards the Premier, the Duke of Portland, fell ill\r\nand resigned: his place was taken by Mr. Perceval, a man whose sole\r\nrecommendation for the post was his conscientious Toryism and powers\r\nof dull plodding. Ruled by an ill-assorted Ministry and a King whose\r\nreason was now hopelessly overclouded, weakened by the strangling grip\r\nof the Continental System, England seemed on the verge of ruin; and,\r\nencouraged alike by the factious conduct of our parliamentary\r\nOpposition and by Soult's recent conquest of Andalusia, Napoleon bent\r\nhimself to the final grapple by extending his coast system, and by\r\nsending Masséna and his choicest troops into Spain to drive the\r\nleopards into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe limits of our space prevent any description of the ensuing\r\ncampaign of Torres Vedras; and we must refer our readers to the ample\r\ncanvas of Napier if they would realize the sagacity of Wellington in\r\nconstructing to the north of Lisbon that mighty _tête de pont_ for the\r\nSea Power against Masséna's veteran army. After dealing the staggering\r\nblow of Busaco at that presumptuous Marshal, our great leader fell\r\nback, through a tract which he swept bare of supplies, on this sure\r\nbulwark, and there watched the French host of some 65,000 men waste\r\naway amidst the miseries of hunger and the rains and diseases of\r\nautumn. At length, in November, Masséna drew off to positions near\r\nSantarem, where he awaited the succour which Napoleon ordered Soult to\r\nbring. It was in vain: Soult, puffed up by his triumphs in Andalusia,\r\nwas resolved to play his own game and reduce Badajoz; he won his point\r\nbut marred the campaign; and, at last, foiled by Wellington's skilful\r\ntactics, Masséna beat a retreat northwards out of Portugal after\r\nlosing some 35,000 men (March, 1811). Wellington's success bore an\r\nimmeasurable harvest of results. The unmanly whinings of the English\r\nOpposition were stilled; the replies of the Czar to Napoleon's demands\r\ngrew firmer; and the patriots of the Peninsula stiffened their backs\r\nin a resistance so stubborn, albeit unskilful, that 370,000 French\r\ntroops utterly failed to keep Wellington in check, and to stamp out\r\nthe national defence in the summer of 1811.\r\n\r\nIn truth, Napoleon had exasperated the Spaniards no less than their\r\n_soi disant_ king, by a series of provocations extending over the year\r\n1810. On the plea that Spain must herself meet the expenses of the\r\nwar, he erected the four northern provinces into commands for French\r\ngenerals, who were independent of his brother's authority and levied\r\nall the taxes over that vast area (February). On May 29th he withdrew\r\nBurgos and Valladolid from Joseph's control, and divided the greater\r\npart of Spain for military and administrative purposes into districts\r\nthat were French satrapies in all but name. The decree was doubly\r\ndisastrous: it gave free play to the feuds of the French chiefs; and\r\nit seemed to the Spaniards to foreshadow a speedy partition of Spain.\r\nThe surmise was correct. Napoleon intended to unite to France the\r\nlands between the Pyrenees and the Ebro. Indeed, in his conception,\r\nthe conquest of Portugal was mainly desirable because it would provide\r\nhis brother with an indemnity in the west for the loss of his northern\r\nprovinces. Joseph's protests against such a partition of the land,\r\nwhich Napoleon had sworn at Bayonne to keep intact, were disregarded;\r\nbut letters on this subject fell into the hands of the Spanish\r\nguerillas and were published by order of the Regency at Cadiz.\r\nDespised by the Spaniards, flouted by Napoleon, set at defiance by the\r\nFrench satraps, and reduced wellnigh to bankruptcy, the puppet King\r\nfelt his position insupportable, and, hurrying to Paris, tendered his\r\nresignation of the crown (May, 1811). In his anxiety to huddle up the\r\nscandal, Napoleon appeased his brother, promised him one-fourth of the\r\ntaxes levied by the French commanders, and coaxed or drove him to\r\nresume his thankless task at Madrid. But the doggedness of the\r\nEmperor's resolve may be measured by the fact that, even when on the\r\nbrink of war with Russia, he defied Spanish national sentiment by\r\nannexing Catalonia to France (March, 1812).\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that Napoleon did not himself proceed to Spain in\r\norder to direct the operations in person and thus still the jealousies\r\nof the Marshals which so hampered his armies. Wellington certainly\r\nfeared his coming. At a later date he told Earl Stanhope that Napoleon\r\nwas vastly superior to any of his Marshals: \"There was nothing like\r\nhim. He suited a French army so exactly.... His presence on the field\r\nmade a difference of 40,000 men.\"[224] That estimate is certainly\r\nmodest if one looks not merely at tactics but at the strategy of the\r\nwhole Peninsular War. But the Emperor did not again come into Spain.\r\nAt the outset of 1810 he prepared to do so; but, as soon as the\r\nAustrian marriage was arranged, he abandoned this salutary project.\r\n\r\nThere were thenceforth several reasons why he should remain in or near\r\nParis. His attentions to his young wife, and his desire to increase\r\nthe splendour of the Court, counted for much. Yet more important was\r\nit to curb the clericals (now incensed at the imprisonment of the\r\nPope), and sharply to watch the intrigues of the royalists and other\r\nmalcontents. Public opinion, also, still needed to be educated; the\r\nconstant drain of men for the wars and the increase in the price of\r\nnecessaries led to grumblings in the Press, which claimed the presence\r\nof his Argus eye and the adoption of a very stringent censorship.[225]\r\nBut, above all, there was the commercial war with England. This could\r\nbe directed best from Paris, where he could speedily hear of British\r\nendeavours to force goods into Germany, Holland, or Italy, and of any\r\nchange in our maritime code.\r\n\r\nImportant as was the war in Spain, it was only one phase of his\r\nworld-wide struggle with the mistress of the seas; and he judged that\r\nif she bled to death under his Continental System, the Peninsular War\r\nmust subside into a guerilla strife, Spain thereafter figuring merely\r\nas a greater Vendée. Accordingly, the year 1810 sees the climax of his\r\ngreat commercial experiment.\r\n\r\nThe first land to be sacrificed to this venture was Holland. For many\r\nmonths the Emperor had been discontented with his brother Louis, who\r\nhad taken into his head the strange notion that he reigned there by\r\ndivine right. As Napoleon pathetically said at St. Helena, when\r\nreviewing the conduct of his brothers, \"If I made one a king, he\r\nimagined that he was _King by the grace of God_. He was no longer my\r\nlieutenant: he was one enemy more for me to watch.\" A singular fate\r\nfor this king-maker, that he should be forgotten and the holy oil\r\nalone remembered! Yet Louis probably used that mediæval notion as a\r\nshield against his brother's dictation. The tough Bonaparte nature\r\nbrooked not the idea of mere lieutenancy. He declined to obey orders\r\nfrom the brother whom he secretly detested. He flatly refused to be\r\ntransferred from the Hague to Madrid, or to put in force the\r\nburdensome decrees of the Continental System.\r\n\r\nOn his side, Napoleon upbraided him with governing too softly, and\r\nwith seeking popularity where he should seek control. After the\r\nWalcheren expedition, he chid him severely for allowing the English\r\nfleet ever to show its face in the Scheldt; for \"the fleets of that\r\nPower ought to find nothing but rocks of iron\" in that river, \"which\r\nwas as important to France as the Thames to England.\"[226] But the\r\nhead and front of his offending was that British goods still found\r\ntheir way into Holland. In vain did the Emperor forbid that American\r\nships which had touched at English ports should be debarred from those\r\nof Holland. In vain did he threaten to close the Scheldt and Rhine to\r\nDutch barges. Louis held on his way, with kindly patience towards his\r\nmerchants, and with a Bonapartist obstinacy proof against fraternal\r\nadvice or threats. At last, early in 1810, Napoleon sent troops to\r\noccupy Walcheren and neighbouring Dutch lands. It seemed for a time as\r\nthough this was but a device to extort favourable terms of peace from\r\nEngland in return for an offer that France would not annex Holland.\r\nNegotiations to this effect were set on foot through the medium of\r\nOuvrard and Labouchere, son-in-law of the banker Baring: Fouché also,\r\nwithout the knowledge of his master, ventured to put forth a\r\ndiplomatic feeler as to a possible Anglo-French alliance against the\r\nUnited States, an action for which he was soon very properly\r\ndisgraced.[227]\r\n\r\nThe negotiation failed, as it deserved to do. Our objections were, not\r\nmerely to the absurd proposal that we should give up our maritime code\r\nif Napoleon would abstain from annexing Holland and the Hanseatic\r\ntowns, but still more against the man himself and his whole policy. We\r\nhad every reason to distrust the good faith of the man who had\r\nbetrayed the Turks at Tilsit, Portugal at Fontainebleau, and the\r\nSpaniards at Bayonne. To pause in the strife, to relax our hold on our\r\nnew colonies, and to desert the Spaniards, in order to preserve the\r\nmerely titular independence of Holland and the Hanse Towns, would have\r\nbeen an act of singular simplicity. Nor does Napoleon seem to have\r\nexpected it. He wrote to his Foreign Minister, Champagny, on March\r\n20th, 1810: \"From not having made peace sooner, England has lost\r\nNaples, Spain, Portugal, and the market of Trieste. If she delays much\r\nlonger, she will lose Holland, the Hanse Towns, and Sicily.\" And\r\nsurely this Sibylline conduct of his required that he should annex\r\nthese lands and all Europe in order to exact a suitable price from the\r\nexhausted islanders. Such was the corollary of the Continental System.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Louis, nettled by the inquisitions of the French\r\n_douaniers_, and by the order of his brother to seize all American\r\nships in Dutch ports, was drawing on himself further reproaches and\r\nthreats: \"Louis, you are incorrigible ... you do not want to reign for\r\nany length of time. States are governed by reason and policy, and not\r\nby acrimony and weakness.\" Twenty thousand French troops were\r\napproaching Amsterdam to bring him to reason, when the young ruler\r\ndecided to be rid of this royal mummery. On the night of July 1st he\r\nfled from Haarlem, and travelled swiftly and secretly eastwards until\r\nhe reached Teplitz, in Bohemia. The ignominy of this flight rested on\r\nthe brother who had made kingship a mockery. The refugee left behind\r\nhim the reputation of a man who, lovable by nature but soured by\r\ndomestic discords, sought to shield his subjects from the ruin into\r\nwhich the rigid application of the Continental System was certain to\r\nplunge them. That fate now befell the unhappy little land. On July 9th\r\nit was annexed to the French Empire, and all the commercial decrees\r\nwere carried out as rigidly at Rotterdam as at Havre.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year, Napoleon's coast system was extended to the\r\nborders of Holstein by the annexation of Oldenburg, the northern parts\r\nof Berg, Westphalia, and Hanover, along with Lauenburg and the Hanse\r\nTowns, Bremen, Hamburg, and Lübeck. The little Swiss Republic of\r\nValais was also absorbed in the Empire.\r\n\r\nThis change in North Germany, which carried the French flag to the\r\nshores of the Baltic, was his final expedient for assuring England's\r\ncommercial ruin. As far back as February, 1798, he had recommended the\r\nextension of French influence over the Hanse Towns as a means of\r\nreducing his most redoubtable foe to surrender, and now there were two\r\nspecial reasons for this annexation. First, the ships of Oldenburg had\r\nbeen largely used for conveying British produce into North\r\nGermany;[228] and secondly, the French commercial code was so rigorous\r\nthat no officials with even the semblance of independence could be\r\ntrusted with its execution. On August 5th a decree had been\r\npromulgated at the Trianon, near Versailles, which imposed enormous\r\nduties on every important colonial product. Cotton--especially that\r\nfrom America--sugar, tea, coffee, cocoa, and other articles were\r\nsubjected to dues, generally of half their value and irrespective of\r\ntheir place of production.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CENTRAL EUROPE AFTER 1810]\r\n\r\nTraders were ordered to declare their possession of all colonial wares\r\nand to pay the duty, under pain of confiscation. Depôts of such goods\r\nwithin four days' distance from the frontiers of the Empire were held\r\nto be clandestine; and troops were sent forthwith into Germany,\r\nSwitzerland, and Spain to seize such stores, a proceeding which\r\naroused the men of Stuttgart, Frankfurt, and Berne to almost open\r\nresistance. It is difficult to see the reason for this decree, except\r\non the supposition that the Continental System did not stop British\r\nimports, and that all tropical products were British.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's own correspondence shows that he believed this to be so. At\r\nthat same time he issued orders that all colonial produce found at\r\nStettin should be confiscated because it was evidently English\r\nproperty brought on American ships. He further recommended Murat and\r\nEugène to press hard on such wares in order to replenish their\r\nexchequers and raise funds for restoring their commerce. Eugène must,\r\nhowever, be careful to tax American and colonial cotton most heavily,\r\nwhile letting in that of the Levant on favourable terms.\r\n\r\nJerome, too, was bidden rigorously to enforce the Trianon tariff in\r\nWestphalia; and the hint was to be passed on to Prussia and the\r\nRhenish Confederation that, by subjecting colonial goods to these\r\nenormous imposts, those States would gain several millions of francs\r\n\"and the loss would fall partly on English commerce and partly on the\r\nsmugglers.\"[229] In fact, all his acts and words at this time reveal\r\nthe densest ignorance, not only of political economy, but of the\r\nelementary facts of commerce, as when he imagined that officials, who\r\nwere sufficiently hard worked with watching a nimble host of some\r\n100,000 smugglers along an immense frontier, would also be able to\r\ndistinguish between Syrian and American cottons, and to exact 800\r\nfrancs from 100 kilogrammes of the latter, as against 400 francs from\r\nthe former, or that six times as much could ever be levied on Chinese\r\nteas as on other teas! Such a tariff called for a highly drilled army\r\nof those sufficiently rare individuals, honest _douaniers_, endowed\r\nalso with Napoleonic activity and omniscience. But, as Chaptal\r\nremarked, the Emperor had never thought much about the needs of\r\ncommerce, and he despised merchants as persons who had \"neither a\r\nfaith nor a country, whose sole object was gain.\" His own notion about\r\ncommerce was that he could \"make it manoeuvre like a regiment\"; and\r\nthis military conception of trade led him to entertain the fond hope\r\nthat exchequers benefited by confiscation and prohibitive tariffs,\r\nthat a \"national commerce\" could be speedily built up by cutting off\r\nimports, and that the burden of loss in the present commercial war\r\nfell on England and not on the continental consumer.\r\n\r\nSuch was the penalty which the great man paid for scorning all new\r\nknowledge as _idéalogie_. The principles set forth by Quesnay, Turgot,\r\nand Adam Smith were to him mere sophistical juggling. He once said to\r\nMollien: \"I seek the good that is practical, not the ideal best: the\r\nworld is very old: we must profit by its experience: it teaches that\r\nold practices are worth more than new theories: you are not the only\r\none who knows trade secrets.\"[230] This was his general attitude\r\ntowards the exponents of new financial or commercial views. Indeed, we\r\ncan hardly think of this great champion of external control and state\r\nintervention favouring the open-handed methods of _laisser faire_.\r\nUnhappy France, that gave this motto to the world but let her greatest\r\nruler emphasize her recent reaction towards commercial mediævalism!\r\nLuckless Emperor, who aspired to found the United States of Europe,\r\nbut outraged the principle which most surely and lastingly works for\r\ninternational harmony, that of Free Trade!\r\n\r\nWhile the Trianon tariff sought to hinder the import of England's\r\ncolonial products, or, failing that, to reap a golden harvest from\r\nthem, Napoleon further endeavoured to terrify continental dealers from\r\naccepting any of her manufactures. His Fontainebleau decree of October\r\n18th, 1810, ordered that all such goods should be seized and publicly\r\nburnt; and five weeks later special tribunals were instituted for\r\nenforcing these ukases and for trying all persons, whether smugglers\r\ncaught red-handed or shopkeepers who inadvertently offered for sale\r\nthe cottons of Lancashire or the silks of Bengal.\r\n\r\nThe canon was now complete. It only remained to convert the world to\r\nthe new gospel of pacific war. The results were soon clearly visible\r\nin a sudden rise of prices throughout France, Germany, and Italy. Raw\r\ncotton now fetched 10 to 11 francs, sugar 6 to 7 francs, coffee 8\r\nfrancs, and indigo 21 francs, per pound, or on the average about ten\r\ntimes the prices then ruling at London.[231] The reason for this\r\nadvantage to the English consumer and manufacturer is clear. England\r\nswayed the tropics and held the seas; and, having a monopoly of\r\ncolonial produce, she could import it easily and abundantly, while the\r\ncontinental purchaser had ultimately to pay for the risks incurred by\r\nhis shopkeeper, by British merchants, and by their smugglers, who \"ran\r\nin\" from Heligoland, Jersey, or Sicily. These classes vied in their\r\nefforts to prick holes in the continental decrees. Bargees and women,\r\ndogs and hearses, were pressed into service against Napoleon. The\r\nlast-named device was for a time tried with much success near Hamburg,\r\nuntil the French authorities, wondering at the strange increase of\r\nfunerals in a river-side suburb, peered into the hearses, and found\r\nthem stuffed full with bales of British merchandise. This gruesome\r\nplan failing, others were tried. Large quantities of sand were brought\r\nfrom the seashore, until, unfortunately for the housewives, some\r\ninquisitive official found that it hailed from the West Indies.\r\n\r\nOr again, devious routes were resorted to. Sugar was smuggled from\r\nLondon into Germany by way of Salonica, that being now almost the only\r\nneutral port open to British commerce. Thence it was borne in panniers\r\non the backs of mules over the Balkans to Belgrade, where it was\r\ntransferred to barges and carried up the Danube. Another illicit trade\r\nroute was from the desolate shores of Dalmatia through Hungary. The\r\nwriter of a pamphlet, \"England, Ireland, and America,\" states that his\r\nfirm then employed 500 horses on and near that coast in carrying\r\nBritish goods into Central Europe, and that the cost of getting them\r\ninto France was \"about £28 per cwt., or more than fifty times the\r\npresent freight to Calcutta.\" In fact, the result of the Emperor's\r\neconomic experiments may be summed up in the statement of Chaptal that\r\nthe general run of prices in France was higher by one-third than it\r\nwas before 1789.\r\n\r\nNow the merest tyro might see that the difference in price above the\r\nnormal level was paid by the consumer. The colonial producer, the\r\nBritish merchant and shipper were certainly harassed, and trade was\r\ndislocated; but, as Mollien observed, commerce soon adapted itself to\r\naltered conditions; and merchants never parted with their wares\r\nwithout getting hard cash or resorting to the primitive method of\r\nbarter. Money was also frequently melted down in France and Germany so\r\nas to effect bargains with England in bars of metal. And so, in one\r\nway or another, trade was carried on, with infinite discomfort and\r\nfriction, it is true; but it never wholly ceased even between England\r\nand France direct.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Napoleon so clung to the old mercantilist craze of\r\nstimulating exports in order that they might greatly exceed the\r\nimports, as to favour the sending of agricultural produce to England,\r\nprovided that such cargoes comprised manufactured goods. He allowed\r\nthis privilege not only to his Empire but also to the Kingdom of\r\nItaly.[232] The difficulty was that England would not receive the\r\nmanufactured goods of her enemies; and, as corn and cheese could not\r\nbe exported to England, unless a certain proportion of silk and cloths\r\nwent with them, the latter were got up so as to satisfy the French\r\ncustoms officers and then cast into the sea. It is needless to add\r\nthat this export of manufactures to England, on which Napoleon prided\r\nhimself, was limited to showy but worthless articles, which were made\r\nsolely _ad usum delphinorum_.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for us that Napoleon entertained these crude ideas on\r\npolitical economy; for his action opened for us a loophole of escape\r\nfrom a very serious difficulty. At that time our fast growing\r\npopulation was barely fed by our own wheat even after good seasons;\r\nand Providence afflicted us in 1809 and 1810 with very poor harvests.\r\nIn 1810 the average price was 103 shillings the quarter, the highest\r\never known except in 1800 and 1801; and as commerce was dislocated by\r\nthe Continental System and hand-labour was being largely replaced by\r\nthe new power-looms and improved spinning machinery, the outlook would\r\nhave been hopeless, had not our great enemy allowed us to import\r\ncontinental corn. This device, which he imagined would impoverish us\r\nto enrich his own States, was the greatest aid that he could have\r\nrendered to our hard-pressed social system; and readers of Charlotte\r\nBrontë's realistic sketches of the Luddite rioting in Yorkshire may\r\nimagine what would have befallen England if, besides lack of work and\r\nlow wages, there had been the added horrors of a bread famine. But\r\nfortunately the curious commercial notions harboured by our foe\r\nenabled us in the winter of 1810-11 to get supplies of corn not only\r\nfrom Prussia and Poland but even from Italy and France.\r\n\r\nIn one sense this incident has been misunderstood. It has been\r\nreferred to by Porter[233] and other hopeful persons as proof positive\r\nthat as long as we can buy corn we shall get it, even from our\r\nenemies. It proves nothing of the sort. Napoleon's correspondence and\r\nhis whole policy with regard to licences, which we shall presently\r\nexamine, shows clearly that he believed he would greatly benefit his\r\nown States and impoverish our people by selling us large stores of\r\ncorn at a very high price. There is no hint in any of his letters that\r\nhe ever framed the notion of _starving_ us into surrender. All that he\r\nlooked to was the draining away of our wealth by cutting off our\r\nexports, and by allowing imports to enter our harbours much as usual.\r\nAs long as he prevented us selling our produce, he heeded little how\r\nmuch we bought from his States: in fact, the more we bought, the\r\nsooner we should be bankrupt--such was his notion.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that he never sought to cut off our corn-supplies. They\r\nwere then drawn almost entirely from the Baltic ports. The United\r\nStates and Canada had as yet only sent us a few driblets of corn. La\r\nPlata and the Cape of Good Hope were quite undeveloped; and our\r\nsettlements in New South Wales were at that time often troubled by\r\ndearth. The plan of sealing up the cornfields of Europe from Riga to\r\nTrieste would have been feasible, at least for a few weeks; French\r\ntroops held Danzig and Stettin; Russia, Prussia, and Denmark were at\r\nhis beck and call; and an imperial decree forbidding the export of\r\ncorn from France and her allied States to the United Kingdom could\r\nhardly have failed to reduce us to starvation and surrender in the\r\nvery critical winter of 1810-11. But that strange mental defect of\r\nclinging with ever increasing tenacity to preconceived notions led\r\nNapoleon to allow and even to favour exports of corn to us in the time\r\nof our utmost need; and Britain survived the strain.[234]\r\n\r\nWhat folly, however, to refer to the action of this man of one\r\neconomic idea as being likely to determine the conduct of continental\r\nstatesmen in some future naval war with England. In truth, the urgency\r\nof the problem of our national food-supply in time of a great war can\r\nonly be fully understood by those who have studied the Napoleonic era.\r\nEngland then grew nearly enough corn for her needs; her fleets swept\r\nthe seas; and Napoleon's economic hobby left her foreign food-supply\r\nunhampered at the severest crisis. Yet, even so, the price of the\r\nquartern loaf rose to more than fifteenpence, and we were brought to\r\nthe verge of civil war. A comparison of that time with the conditions\r\nthat now prevail must yield food for reflection to all but the\r\ncase-hardened optimists.\r\n\r\nBut already Napoleon was convinced that the Continental System must be\r\nsecretly relaxed in special cases. Despite the fulsome addresses which\r\nsome Chambers of Commerce sent up, he knew that his seaports were in\r\nthe depths of distress, and that French cotton manufacturers could not\r\nhope to compete with those of Lancashire now that his own tariff had\r\ndoubled the price of raw cotton and dyes in France. He therefore hit\r\nupon the curious device of allowing continental merchants to buy\r\nlicences for the privilege of secretly evading his own decrees. The\r\nEnglish Government seems to have been the first to issue similar\r\nsecret permits; but Napoleon had scarcely signed his Berlin Decree for\r\nthe blockade of England before he connived at its infraction. When\r\nsugar, coffee, and other comforts became scarce, they were secretly\r\nimported from perfidious Albion for the imperial table. The final\r\nstage was reached in July, 1810, when licences to import forbidden\r\ngoods were secretly sold to favoured merchants, and many\r\nofficials--among them Bourrienne--reaped a rich harvest from the sale\r\nof these imperial indulgences. Merchants were so eager to evade the\r\nhated laws that they offered high prices to the treasury and\r\n_douceurs_ to officials for the coveted boon; and as much as £40,000\r\nis said to have been paid for a single licence.\r\n\r\nOn both sides of the Channel this device was abhorred, but its results\r\nwere specially odious in Napoleon's States, where the burdens to be\r\nevaded were far heavier than those entailed by the Orders in Council.\r\nIn fact, the Continental System was now seen to be an organized\r\nhypocrisy, which, in order to ruin the mistress of the seas, exposed\r\nthe peoples to burdens more grievous than those borne by England, and\r\nleft all but the wealthiest merchants a prey to a grinding fiscal\r\ntyranny. And the sting of it all was its social injustice; for while\r\nthe poor were severely punished, sometimes with death, for smuggling\r\nsugar or tobacco, Napoleon and the favoured few who could buy licences\r\noften imported these articles in large quantities. What wonder, then,\r\nthat Russia and Sweden should decline long to endure these gratuitous\r\nhardships, and should seek to evade the behests of the imperial\r\nsmuggler of the Tuileries!\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as no inventive people can ever be thrown wholly on its\r\nown resources without deriving some benefit, we find that France met\r\nthe crisis with the cheery patience and unflagging ingenuity which she\r\nhas ever evinced. In a great Empire which embraced all the lands\r\nbetween Hamburg, Bayonne, and Rome, not to mention Illyria and\r\nDalmatia, a great variety of products might readily reward the\r\ninventor and the husbandman. Tobacco, rice, and cotton could be reared\r\nin the southern portions. Valiant efforts were also made to get\r\nAsiatic produce overland, so as to disappoint the English cruisers;\r\nand the coffee of Arabia was taxed very lightly, so as to ruin the\r\nAmerican producer. When the fragrant berry became more and more\r\nscarce, chicory was discovered by good patriots to be a palatable\r\nsubstitute, and scientific men sought to induce French manufacturers\r\nto use the isatis plant instead of indigo. Prizes were offered by the\r\nState and by local Chambers of Commerce to those who should make up\r\nfor the lack of tropical goods and dyes.\r\n\r\nA notable discovery was made by Chaptal and Delessert, who improved on\r\nMarkgraf's process of procuring sugar from beetroot and made it a\r\npractical success. Napoleon also hoped that a chemical substitute for\r\nindigo had been found, and exclaimed to a doleful deputation of\r\nmerchants, who came to the Tuileries in the early summer of 1811, that\r\nchemistry would soon revolutionize commerce as completely as the\r\ndiscovery of the compass had done. Besides, the French Empire was the\r\nrichest country in the world, and could almost do without foreign\r\ncommerce, at least until England had given way; and that would soon\r\ncome to pass; for the pressure of events would soon compel London\r\nmerchants to throw their sugar and indigo into the Thames.[235]\r\n\r\nIn reality, he placed commerce far behind agriculture, which he\r\nconsidered to be the basis of a nation's wealth and a nation's health.\r\nBut he also took a keen interest in manufactures. The silk industry at\r\nLyons found in him a generous patron. He ordered that the best\r\nscientific training should there be given, so as to improve the\r\nprocesses of manufacture; and, as silk of nearly all kinds could be\r\nproduced in France and Italy, Lyons was comparatively prosperous.\r\nWhen, however, it suffered from the general rise of prices and from\r\nthe impaired buying power of the community, he adopted heroic\r\nremedies. He ordered that all ships leaving France should carry silk\r\nfabrics equal in value to one-fourth of the whole freight; but whether\r\nthese stuffs went to adorn women or mermaids seems an open question.\r\nOr again, on the advice of Chaptal, the Emperor made large purchases\r\nof surplus stocks of Lyons silk, Rouen cottons, and Ste. Antoine\r\nfurniture, so as to prevent an imminent collapse of credit and a\r\nrecrudescence of Jacobinism in those industrial centres; for as he\r\nsaid: \"I fear a rising brought about by want of bread: I had rather\r\nfight an army of 200,000 men than that.\"[236]\r\n\r\nIn the main, this policy of giving _panem et circenses_ was successful\r\nin France; at least, it kept her quiet. The national feeling ran\r\nstrongly in favour of commercial prohibition. In 1787 Arthur Young\r\nfound the cotton-workers of the north furious at the recent inroads of\r\nLancashire cottons, while the wine-growers of the Garonne were equally\r\nfavourable to the enlightened Anglo-French commercial treaty of 1786.\r\nIt was Napoleon's lot to win the favour of the rigid protectionists,\r\nwhile not alienating that of the men of the Gironde, who saw in him\r\nthe champion of agrarian liberty against the feudal nobles. Moreover,\r\nthe nation still cherished the pathetic belief that the war was due to\r\nAlbion's perfidy respecting Malta, and burned with a desire to\r\nchastise the recreant islanders. For these reasons, Frenchmen endured\r\nthe drain of men and money with but little show of grumbling.\r\n\r\nThey were tired of the wars. _We have had enough glory_, they said,\r\neven in the capital itself, and an acute German observer describes the\r\nfeeling there as curiously mixed. Parisian gaiety often found vent in\r\nlampoons against the Emperor; and much satire at his expense might\r\nwith safety be indulged in among a crowd, provided it were seasoned\r\nwith wit. The people seemed not to fear Napoleon, as he was feared in\r\nGermany: the old revolutionary party was still active and might easily\r\nbecome far more dangerous than the royalist coteries of the Boulevard\r\nSt. Germain. For the rest, they were all so accustomed to political\r\nchange that they looked on his government as provisional, and put up\r\nwith him only as long as the army triumphed abroad and he could make\r\nhis power felt at home. Such was the impression of Paris gained by\r\nVarnhagen von Ense. Public opinion in the provinces seems to have been\r\nmore favourable to Napoleon; and, on the whole, pride in the army and\r\nin the vigorous administration which that nation loves, above all,\r\nhatred of England and the hope of wresting from her the world's\r\nempire, led the French silently to endure rigorous press laws,\r\nincreased taxes, war prices, licences, and chicory.\r\n\r\nFor Germans the hardships were much greater and the alleviations far\r\nless. They had no deep interest in Malta or in the dominion of the\r\nseas; and political economy was then only beginning to dawn on the\r\nTeutonic mind. The general trend of German thought had inclined\r\ntowards the _Everlasting Nay_, until Napoleon flashed across its ken.\r\nFor a time he won the admiration of the chief thinkers of Germany by\r\nbrushing away the feudal cobwebs from her fair face. He seemed about\r\nto call her sons to a life of public activity; and in the famous\r\nsoliloquy of Faust, in which he feels his way from word to thought,\r\nfrom thought to might, and from might to action, we may discern the\r\nliterary projection of the influence exerted by the new Charlemagne on\r\nthat nation of dreamers.[237] But the promise was fulfilled only in\r\nthe most harshly practical way, namely, by cutting off all supplies of\r\ntobacco and coffee; and when Teufelsdröckh himself, admirer though he\r\nwas of the French Revolution, found that the summons for his favourite\r\nbeverage--the \"dear melancholy coffee, that begets fancies,\" of\r\nLessing--produced only a muddy decoction of acorns, there was the risk\r\nof his tendencies earthwards taking a very practically revolutionary\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the German universities were the leaders of the national\r\nreaction against the Emperor of the West. Fichte's pleading for a\r\ntruly national education had taken effect. Elementary instruction was\r\nnow being organized in Prussia; and the divorce of thought from\r\naction, which had so long sterilized German life, was ended by the\r\nfoundation of the University of Berlin by Humboldt. Thus, in 1810, the\r\nyear of Prussia's deepest woe, when her brave Queen died of a stricken\r\nheart, when French soldiers and _douaniers_ were seizing and burning\r\ncolonial wares, her thinkers came into closer touch with her men of\r\naction, with mutually helpful results. Thinkers ceased to be mere\r\ndreamers, and Prussian officials gained a wider outlook on life. The\r\nlife of beneficent activity, to which Napoleon might have summoned the\r\ngreat majority of Germans, dawned on them from Berlin, not from Paris.\r\n\r\nHis influence was more and more oppressive. The final results of his\r\ncommercial decrees on the trade of Hamburg were thus described by\r\nPerthes, a well-known writer and bookseller of that town: \"Of the 422\r\nsugar-boiling houses, few now stood open: the printing of cottons had\r\nceased entirely: the tobacco-dressers were driven away by the\r\nGovernment. The imposition of innumerable taxes, door and window,\r\ncapitation and land taxes, drove the inhabitants to despair.\" But the\r\nsame sagacious thinker was able to point the moral of it all, and\r\nprove to his friends that their present trials were due to the selfish\r\nparticularism of the German States: \"It was a necessity that some\r\ngreat power should arise in the midst of the degenerate selfishness of\r\nthe times and also prove victorious, for there was nothing vigorous to\r\noppose it. Napoleon is an historical necessity.\"[238]\r\n\r\nThus, both in the abodes of learning and in the centres of industry\r\nmen were groping after a higher unity and a firmer political\r\norganization, which, after the Napoleonic deluge had swept by, was to\r\nlay the foundation of a New Germany.\r\n\r\nTo all appearances, however, Napoleon's power seemed to be more firmly\r\nestablished than ever in the ensuing year. On March 20th, 1811, a son\r\nwas born to him. At the crisis of this event, he revealed the warmth\r\nof his family instincts. On hearing that the life of mother or infant\r\nmight have to be sacrificed, he exclaimed at once, \"Save the\r\nmother.\"[239] When the danger was past, he very considerately informed\r\nJosephine, stating, \"he has my chest, my mouth and my eyes. I trust\r\nthat he will fulfil his destiny.\" That destiny was mapped out in the\r\ntitle conferred on the child, \"King of Rome,\" which was designed to\r\nrecall the title \"King of the Romans,\" used in the Holy Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nNapoleon resolved that the old elective dignity should now be renewed\r\nin a strictly hereditary Empire, vaster than that of Charlemagne.\r\nParis was to be its capital, Rome its second city, and the future\r\nEmperors were always to be crowned a second time at Rome. Furthermore,\r\nlest the mediæval dispute as to the supremacy of Emperor or Pope in\r\nRome should again vex mankind, the Papacy was virtually annexed: the\r\nstatus of the pontiff was defined in the most Erastian sense, imperial\r\nfunds were assigned for his support, and he was bidden to maintain two\r\npalaces, \"the one necessarily at Paris, the other at Rome.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible briefly to describe the various conflicts between\r\nPius VII. and Napoleon. Though now kept in captivity by Napoleon, the\r\nPope refused to ratify these and other ukases of his captor; and the\r\ncredit which Napoleon had won by his wordly-wise\r\nConcordat was now lost by his infraction of many of its clauses and by\r\nhis harsh treatment of a defenceless old man. It is true that Pius had\r\nexcommunicated Napoleon; but that was for the crime of annexing the\r\nPapal States, and public opinion revolted at the spectacle of an\r\nall-powerful Emperor now consigning to captivity the man who in former\r\nyears had done so much to consolidate his authority. After the\r\ndisasters of the Russian campaign, he sought to come to terms with the\r\npontiff; but even then the bargain struck at Fontainebleau was so hard\r\nthat his prisoner, though unnerved by ill-health, retracted the unholy\r\ncompromise. Whereupon Napoleon ordered that the cardinals who advised\r\nthis step should be seized and carried away from Fontainebleau. Few of\r\nNapoleon's actions were more harmful than this series of petty\r\npersecutions; and among the influences that brought about his fall, we\r\nmay reckon the dignified resistance of the pontiff, whose meekness\r\nthrew up in sharp relief the pride and arrogance of his captor. The\r\nPapacy stooped, but only to conquer.\r\n\r\nFor the present, everything seemed to favour the new Charlemagne.\r\nNever had the world seen embodied might like that of Napoleon's\r\nEmpire; and well might he exclaim at the birth of the King of Rome,\r\n\"Now begins the finest epoch of my reign.\" All the auguries seemed\r\nfavourable. In France, the voice of opposition was all but hushed.\r\nItalians, Swiss, and even some Spaniards, helped to keep down Prussia.\r\nDutchmen and Danes had hunted down Schill for him at Stralsund. Polish\r\nhorsemen had charged up the Somosierra Pass against the Spanish guns,\r\nand did valiant service on the bloody field of Albuera. The\r\nConfederation of the Rhine could send forth 150,000 men to fight his\r\nbattles. The Hapsburgs were his vassals, and only faint shadows of\r\ndiscord as yet clouded his relations with Alexander. One of his\r\nMarshals, Bernadotte, had been chosen to succeed to the crown of\r\nSweden; and at the other end of Europe, it seemed that Wellington and\r\nthe Spanish patriots must ultimately succumb to superior numbers.\r\n\r\nSurely now was the time for the fulfilment of those glowing oriental\r\ndesigns beside which his European triumphs seemed pale. In the autumn\r\nof 1810 he sent agents carefully to inspect the strongholds of Egypt\r\nand Syria, and his consuls in the Levant were ordered to send a report\r\nevery six months on the condition of the Turkish Empire.[240] Above\r\nall, he urged on the completion of dockyards and ships of war. Vast\r\nworks were pushed on at Antwerp and Cherbourg: ships and gunboats were\r\nto be built at every suitable port from the Texel to Naples and\r\nTrieste; and as the result of these labours, the Emperor counted on\r\nhaving 104 ships of the line, which would cover the transports from\r\nthe Mediterranean, Cherbourg, Boulogne and the Scheldt, and threaten\r\nEngland with an array of 200,000 fighting men.[241]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1811, this plan was modified, possibly because, as in 1804,\r\nhe found the difficulties of a descent on our coasts greater than he\r\nfirst imagined. He now seeks merely to weary out the English in the\r\npresent year. But in the next year, or in 1813, he will send an\r\nexpedition of 40,000 men from the Scheldt, as if to menace Ireland;\r\nand, having thrown us off our guard, he will divide that force into\r\nfour parts for the recovery of the French and Dutch colonies in the\r\nWest Indies. He counts also on having a part of his army in Spain free\r\nfor service elsewhere: it must be sent to seize Sicily or Egypt.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all. His thoughts also turn to the Cape of Good Hope.\r\nEight thousand men are to sail from Brest to seize that point of\r\nvantage at which he had gazed so longingly in 1803. Of these plans,\r\nthe recovery of Egypt evidently lay nearest to his heart. He orders\r\nthe storage at Toulon of everything needful for an Egyptian\r\nexpedition, along with sixty gun-vessels of light draught suitable for\r\nthe navigation of the Nile or of the lakes near the coast.[242] Decrès\r\nis charged to send models of these craft; and we may picture the eager\r\nscrutiny which they received. For the Orient was still the pole to\r\nwhich Napoleon's whole being responded. Turned away perforce by wars\r\nwith Austria, Russia, Prussia, and Spain, it swung round towards Egypt\r\nand India on the first chance of European peace, only to be driven\r\nback by some untoward shock nearer home. In 1803 he counted on the\r\nspeedy opening of a campaign on the Ganges. In 1811 he proposes that\r\nthe tricolour shall once more wave on the citadel of Cairo, and\r\nthreaten India from the shores of the Red Sea. But a higher will than\r\nhis disposed of these events, and ordained that he should then be\r\nflung back from Russia and fight for his Empire in the plains of\r\nSaxony.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTHE RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo mighty and ambitious potentates never fully trust one another.\r\nUnder all the shows of diplomatic affection, there remains a thick\r\nrind of reserve or fear. Especially must that be so with men who\r\nspring from a fierce untamed stock. Despite the training of Laharpe,\r\nAlexander at times showed the passions and finesse of a Boyar. And who\r\nshall say that the early Jacobinism and later culture of Napoleon was\r\nmore than a veneer spread all too thinly over an Italian _condottiere_\r\nof the Renaissance age? These men were too expert at wiles really to\r\ntrust to the pompous assurances of Tilsit and Erfurt. De Maistre tells\r\nus that Napoleon never partook of Alexander's repasts on the banks of\r\nthe Niemen. For him Muscovite cookery was suspect.\r\n\r\nAmidst the glories of Erfurt, Oudinot saw an incident that revealed\r\nthe Czar's hidden feelings. During one of their rides, the Emperors\r\nwere stopped by a dyke, which Napoleon's steed refused to take;\r\naccordingly the Marshal had to help it across; but the Czar, proud of\r\nhis horsemanship, finally cleared the obstacle with a splendid bound,\r\nthough at the cost of a shock which broke his sword-belt. The sword\r\nfell to the ground, and Oudinot was about to hand it to Alexander,\r\nwhen Napoleon quickly said: \"Keep that sword and bring it to me\r\nlater\": then, turning to the Czar, he added: \"You have no objection,\r\nSire?\" A look of surprise and distrust flashed across the Czar's\r\nfeatures; but, resuming his easy bearing, he gave his assent. Later in\r\nthe day, Napoleon sent his own sword to Alexander, and thus came off\r\neasily best from an incident which threatened at first to throw him\r\ninto the shade. The affair shows the ready wit and mental superiority\r\nof the one man no less than the veiled reserve and uneasiness of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1809, Alexander confessed his inner feeling to\r\nCzartoryski. Napoleon, he said, was a man who would not scruple to use\r\nany means so long as he gained his end: his mental strength was\r\nunquestioned: in the worst troubles he was cool and collected: his\r\nfits of passion were only meant to intimidate: his every act was the\r\nresult of calculation: it was absurd to say that his prodigious\r\nexertions would drive him mad: his health was splendid and was equal\r\nto any effort provided that he had eight hours' sleep every day. The\r\nimpression left on the ex-Minister was that Alexander understood his\r\nally thoroughly and _feared him greatly_.[243]\r\n\r\nA few days later came Napoleon's request for the hand of the Czar's\r\nsister, a request which Alexander declined with many expressions of\r\ngoodwill and regret. What, then, was his surprise to find that, before\r\nthe final answer had been returned, Napoleon was in treaty for the\r\nhand of an Austrian Archduchess.[244] This time it was for him to feel\r\naffronted. And so this breathless search for a bride left sore\r\nfeelings at both capitals, at Paris because the Czar declined\r\nNapoleon's request, at St. Petersburg because the imperial wooer was\r\noff on another scent before the first had given out.\r\n\r\nAlexander's annoyance was increased by his ally's doubtful behaviour\r\nabout Poland. After the recent increase of the Duchy of Warsaw he had\r\nurged Napoleon to make a declaration that \"the Kingdom of Poland shall\r\nnever be re-established.\" This matter was being discussed side by side\r\nwith the matrimonial overtures; and, after their collapse, Napoleon\r\nfinally declined to give this assurance which Alexander felt needful\r\nfor checking the rising hopes of Poles and Lithuanians. The utmost the\r\nFrench Emperor would do was to promise, _in a secret clause_, that he\r\nwould never aid any other Power or any popular movement that aimed at\r\nthe re-establishment of that kingdom.[245] In fact, as the Muscovite\r\nalliance was on the wane, he judged it bad policy to discourage the\r\nPoles, who might do so much for him in case of a Franco-Russian war.\r\nHe soon begins to face seriously the prospect of such an event. At the\r\nclose of 1810 he writes that the Russians are intrenching themselves\r\non the Dwina and Dniester, which \"shows a bad spirit.\"\r\n\r\nBut the great difficulty is Russia's imperfect observation of the\r\nContinental System. He begs the Czar to close his ports against\r\nEnglish ships: 600 of them are wandering about the Baltic, after being\r\nrepulsed from its southern shores, in the hope of getting into Russian\r\nharbours. Let Alexander seize their cargoes, and England, now at her\r\nlast gasp, must give in. Five weeks later he returns to the charge. It\r\nis not enough to seize British ships; the hated wares get in under\r\nAmerican, Swedish, Spanish, and Portuguese, _even under French flags_.\r\nOf the 2,000 ships that entered the Baltic in 1810, not one was really\r\na neutral: they were all charged with English goods, with false papers\r\nand _forged certificates of origin manufactured in London_.[246] Any\r\nother unit among earth's millions would have been convinced of the\r\nfutility of the whole enterprise, now that his own special devices\r\nwere being turned against him. It was not enough to conquer and\r\nenchain the Continent. Every customs officer must be an expert in\r\nmanufactures, groceries, documents, and the water-marks of paper, if\r\nhe was to detect the new \"frauds of the neutral flags.\"\r\n\r\nBut Napoleon knew not the word impossible--\"a word that exists only in\r\nthe dictionary of fools.\" In fact, his mind, naturally unbending, was\r\nnow working more and more in self-made grooves. Of these the deepest\r\nwas his commercial warfare; and he pushed on, reckless of Europe and\r\nreckless of the Czar. In the middle of December he annexed the North\r\nSea coast of Germany, including Oldenburg. The heir to this duchy had\r\nmarried Alexander's sister, whose hand Napoleon had claimed at Erfurt.\r\nThe duke, it is true, was offered the district of Erfurt as an\r\nindemnity; but that proposal only stung the Czar the more. The\r\ndeposition of the duke was not merely a personal affront; it was an\r\ninfraction of the Treaty of Tilsit which had restored him to his\r\nduchy.\r\n\r\nA fortnight later, when as yet he knew not of the Oldenburg incident,\r\nAlexander himself broke that treaty.[247] At the close of 1810 he\r\ndeclined to admit land-borne goods on the easy terms arranged at\r\nTilsit, but levied heavy dues on them, especially on the _articles de\r\nluxe_ that mostly hailed from France. Some such step was inevitable.\r\nUnable to export freely to England, Russia had not money enough to buy\r\ncostly French goods without disordering the exchange and ruining her\r\ncredit. While seeking to raise revenue on French manufactures, the\r\nCzar resolved to admit on easy terms all colonial goods, especially\r\nAmerican. English goods he would shut out as heretofore; and he\r\nclaimed that this new departure was well within the limits of the\r\nTreaty of Tilsit. Far different was Napoleon's view: \"Here is a great\r\nplanet taking a wrong direction. I do not understand its course at\r\nall.\"[248] Such were his first words on reading the text of the new\r\nukase. A fatalistic tone now haunts his references to Russia's policy.\r\nOn April 2nd he writes: \"If Alexander does not quickly stop the\r\nimpetus which has been given, he will be carried away by it next year;\r\nand thus war will take place in spite of him, _in spite of me_, in\r\nspite of the interests of France and Russia.... It is an operatic\r\nscene, of which the English are the shifters.\" What madness! As if\r\nRussia's craving for colonial wares and solvency were a device of the\r\ndiabolical islanders.[249] As if his planetary simile were anything\r\nmore than a claim that he was the centre of the universe and his will\r\nits guiding and controlling power.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Russia held on her way. In vain did Alexander explain to\r\nhis ally the economic needs of his realm, protest his fidelity to the\r\nContinental System, and beg some consideration for the Duke of\r\nOldenburg. It was evident that the Emperor of the West would make no\r\nreal concession. In fact, the need of domination was the quintessence\r\nof his being. And Maret, Duc de Bassano, who was now his Foreign\r\nMinister, or rather, we should say, the man who wrote and signed his\r\ndespatches, revealed the psychological cause of the war which cost the\r\nlives of nearly a million of men, in a note to Lauriston, the French\r\nambassador at St. Petersburg. Napoleon, he wrote, cared little about\r\ninterviews or negotiations unless the movements of his 450,000 men\r\ncaused serious concern in Russia, recalled her to the Continental\r\nSystem as settled at Tilsit, and \"brought her back to the state of\r\ninferiority in which she was then.\"[250]\r\n\r\nThis was, indeed, the gist of the whole question. Napoleon saw that\r\nAlexander was slipping out of the leading strings of Tilsit, and that\r\nhe was likely to come off best from that bargain, which was intended\r\nto confirm the supremacy of the Western Empire. For both potentates\r\nthat treaty had been, at bottom, nothing more than a truce. Napoleon\r\nsaw in it a means of subjecting the Continent to his commercial code,\r\nand of preparing for a Franco-Russian partition of Turkey. The Czar\r\nhailed it as a breathing space wherein he could reorganize his army,\r\nconquer Finland, and stride towards the Balkans. The Erfurt interview\r\nprolonged the truce; for Napoleon felt the supreme need of stamping\r\nout the Spanish Rising and of postponing the partition of Turkey which\r\nhis ally was eager to begin. By the close of 1811 both potentates had\r\nexhausted all the benefits likely to accrue from their alliance.[251]\r\nNapoleon flattered himself that the conquest of Spain was wellnigh\r\nassured, and that England was in her last agonies. On the other hand,\r\nRussia had recovered her military strength, had gained Finland and\r\nplanted her foot on the Lower Danube, and now sought to shuffle off\r\nNapoleon's commercial decrees. In fine, the monarch, who at Tilsit had\r\nfigured as mere clay in the hands of the Corsican potter, had proved\r\nhimself to be his equal both in cunning and tenacity. The seeming dupe\r\nof 1807 now promised to be the victor in statecraft.\r\n\r\nThen there was the open sore of Poland. The challenge, on this\r\nsubject, was flung down by Napoleon at a diplomatic reception on his\r\nbirthday, August 15th, 1811. Addressing the Russian envoy, he\r\nexclaimed: \"I am not so stupid as to think that it is Oldenburg which\r\ntroubles you. I see that Poland is the question: you attribute to me\r\ndesigns in favour of Poland. I begin to think that you wish to seize\r\nit. No: if your army were encamped on Montmartre, I would not cede an\r\ninch of the Warsaw territory, not a village, not a windmill.\" His\r\nfears as to Russia's designs were far-fetched. Alexander's sounding of\r\nthe Poles was a defensive measure, seriously undertaken only after\r\nNapoleon's refusal to discourage the Polish nationalists. But it\r\nsuited the French Emperor to aver that the quarrel was about Poland\r\nrather than the Continental System, and the scene just described is a\r\ngood specimen of his habit of cool calculation even in seemingly\r\nchance outbursts of temper. His rhapsody gained him the ardent support\r\nof the Poles, and was vague enough to cause no great alarm to Austria\r\nand Prussia.[252]\r\n\r\nOn the next day Napoleon sketched to his Ministers the general plan of\r\ncampaign against Russia. The whole of the Continent was to be\r\nembattled against her. On the Hapsburg alliance he might well rely.\r\nBut the conduct of Prussia gave him some concern. For a time she\r\nseemed about to risk a war _à outrance_, such as Stein, Fichte, and\r\nthe staunch patriots of the Tugendbund ardently craved. Indeed,\r\nNapoleon's threats to this hapless realm seemed for a time to portend\r\nits annihilation. The King, therefore, sent Scharnhorst first to St.\r\nPetersburg and then to Vienna with secret overtures for an alliance.\r\nThey were virtually refused. Prudence was in the ascendant at both\r\ncapitals; and, as will presently appear, the more sagacious Prussians\r\nsoon came to see that a war, in which Napoleon could be enticed into\r\nthe heart of Russia, might deal a mortal blow at his overgrown Empire.\r\nCertainly it was quite impossible for Prussia to stay the French\r\nadvance. A guerilla warfare, such as throve in Spain, must surely be\r\ncrushed in her open plains; and the diffident King returned\r\nGneisenau's plan of a rising of the Prussian people against Napoleon\r\nwith the chilling comment, \"Very good as poetry.\"\r\n\r\nThus, when Napoleon wound up his diplomatic threats by an imperious\r\nsummons to side with him or against him, Frederick William was fain to\r\nabide by his terms, sending 20,000 troops against Russia, granting\r\nfree passage to Napoleon's army, and furnishing immense supplies of\r\nfood and forage, the payment of which was to be settled by some future\r\narrangement (February, 1812). These conditions seemed to thrust\r\nPrussia down to the lowest circle of the Napoleonic Inferno; and great\r\nwas the indignation of her patriots. They saw not that only by\r\nstooping before the western blast could Prussia be saved. To this\r\ntopic we shall recur presently, when we treat of the Russian plan of\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nSweden was less tractable than Napoleon expected. He had hoped that\r\nthe deposition of his personal enemy, Gustavus IV., the enthronement\r\nof a feeble old man, Charles XIII., and the choice of Bernadotte as\r\nheir to the Swedish crown, would bring that land back to its\r\ntraditional alliance with France. But, on accepting his new dignity,\r\nBernadotte showed his customary independence of thought by refusing to\r\npromise that he would never bear arms against France--a refusal that\r\ncost him his principality of Ponte Corvo. He at once adopted a forward\r\nScandinavian policy; and, as the Franco-Russian alliance waned, he\r\noffered Swedish succour to Napoleon if he would favour the acquisition\r\nof Norway by the Court of Stockholm.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor had himself mooted this project in 1802, but he now\r\nreturned a stern refusal (February 25th, 1811), and bade Sweden\r\nenforce the Continental System under pain of the occupation of Swedish\r\nPomerania by French troops. Even this threat failed to bend the will\r\nof Bernadotte, and the Swedes preferred to forego their troublesome\r\nGerman province rather than lose their foreign commerce. In the\r\nfollowing January, Napoleon carried out his threat, thereby throwing\r\nSweden into the arms of Russia. By the treaty of March-April, 1812,\r\nBernadotte gained from Alexander the prospect of acquiring Norway, in\r\nreturn for the aid of Sweden in the forthcoming war against Napoleon.\r\nThis was the chief diplomatic success gained by Alexander; for though\r\nhe came to terms with Turkey two months later (retaining Bessarabia),\r\nthe treaty was ratified too late to enable him to concentrate all his\r\nforces against the Napoleonic host that was now flooding the plains of\r\nPrussia.[253]\r\n\r\nThe results of this understanding with the Court of Stockholm were\r\nseen in the Czar's note presented at Paris at the close of April. He\r\nrequired of Napoleon the evacuation of Swedish Pomerania by French\r\ntroops and a friendly adjustment of Franco-Swedish disputes, the\r\nevacuation of Prussia by the French, the reduction of their large\r\ngarrison at Danzig, and the recognition of Russia's right to trade\r\nwith neutrals. If these terms were accorded by France, Alexander was\r\nready to negotiate for an indemnity for the Duke of Oldenburg and a\r\nmitigation of the Russian customs dues on French goods.[254] The\r\nreception given by Napoleon to these reasonable terms was unpromising.\r\n\"You are a gentleman,\" he exclaimed to Prince Kurakin, \"--and yet you\r\ndare to present to me such proposals?--You are acting as Prussia did\r\nbefore Jena.\" Alexander had already given up all hope of peace. A week\r\nbefore that scene, he had left St. Petersburg for the army, knowing\r\nfull well that Napoleon's cast-iron will might be shivered by a mighty\r\nblow, but could never be bent by diplomacy.\r\n\r\nOn his side, Napoleon sought to overawe his eastern rival by a display\r\nof imposing force. Lord of a dominion that far excelled that of the\r\nCzar in material resources, suzerain of seven kingdoms and thirty\r\nprincipalities, he called his allies and vassals about him at Dresden,\r\nand gave to the world the last vision of that imperial splendour which\r\ndazzled the imagination of men.\r\n\r\nIt was an idle display. In return for secret assurances that he might\r\neventually regain his Illyrian provinces, the Emperor Francis had\r\npledged himself by treaty to send 30,000 men to guard Napoleon's flank\r\nin Volhynia. But everyone at St. Petersburg knew that this aid, along\r\nwith that of Prussia, was forced and hollow.[255] The example of Spain\r\nand the cautious strategy of Wellington had dissolved the spell of\r\nFrench invincibility; and the Czar was resolved to trust to the\r\ntoughness of his people and the defensive strength of his boundless\r\nplains. The time of the Macks, the Brunswicks, the Bennigsens was\r\npast: the day of Wellington and of truly national methods of warfare\r\nhad dawned.\r\n\r\nYet the hosts now moving against Alexander bade fair to overwhelm the\r\ndevotion of his myriad subjects and the awful solitudes of his\r\nsteppes. It was as if Peter the Hermit had arisen to impel the peoples\r\nof Western and Central Europe once more against the immobile East.\r\nFrenchmen to the number of 200,000 formed the kernel of this vast\r\nbody: 147,000 Germans from the Confederation of the Rhine followed the\r\nnew Charlemagne: nearly 80,000 Italians under Eugène formed an Army of\r\nObservation: 60,000 Poles stepped eagerly forth to wrest their\r\nnation's liberty from the Muscovite grasp; and Illyrians, Swiss, and\r\nDutch, along with a few Spaniards and Portuguese, swelled the Grand\r\nArmy to a total of 600,000 men. Nor was this all. Austria and Prussia\r\nsent their contingents, amounting in all to 50,000 men, to guard\r\nNapoleon's flanks on the side of Volhynia and Courland. And this\r\nmighty mass, driven on by Napoleon's will, gained a momentum which was\r\nto carry its main army to Moscow.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing his vassals at Dresden, and hurrying on the\r\narrangements for the transport of stores, Napoleon journeyed to the\r\nbanks of the Niemen. On all sides were to be seen signs of the passage\r\nof a mighty host, broken-down carts, dead horses, wrecked villages,\r\nand dense columns of troops that stripped Prussia wellnigh bare. Yet,\r\ndespite these immense preparations, no hint of discouragement came\r\nfrom the Czar's headquarters. On arriving at the Niemen, Napoleon\r\nissued to the Grand Army a proclamation which was virtually a\r\ndeclaration of war. In it there occurred the fatalistic remark:\r\n\"Russia is drawn on by fate: her destinies must be fulfilled.\"\r\nAlexander's words to his troops breathed a different spirit: \"God\r\nfights against the aggressor.\"\r\n\r\nMuch that is highly conjectural has been written about the plans of\r\ncampaign of the two Emperors. That of Napoleon may be briefly stated:\r\nit was to find out the enemy's chief forces, divide them, or cut them\r\nfrom their communications, and beat them in detail. In other words, he\r\nnever started with any set plan of campaign, other than the\r\ndestruction of the chief opposing force. But, in the present instance,\r\nit may be questioned whether he had not sought by his exasperating\r\nprovocations to drive Prussia into alliance with the Czar. In that\r\ncase, Alexander would have been bound in honour to come to the aid of\r\nhis ally. And if the Russians ventured across the Niemen, or the\r\nVistula, as Napoleon at first believed they would,[256] his task would\r\ndoubtless have been as easy as it proved at Friedland. Many Prussian\r\nofficers, so Müffling asserts, believed that this was the aim of\r\nFrench diplomacy in the early autumn of 1811, and that the best reply\r\nwas an unconditional surrender. On the other hand, there is the fact\r\nthat St. Marsan, Napoleon's ambassador at Berlin, assured that\r\nGovernment, on October 29th, that his master did not wish to destroy\r\nPrussia, but laid much stress on the supplies which she could furnish\r\nhim--a support that would enable the Grand Army to advance on the\r\nNiemen _like a rushing stream_.\r\n\r\nThe metaphor was strangely imprudent. It almost invited Prussia to\r\nopen wide her sluices and let the flood foam away on to the sandy\r\nwastes of Lithuania; and we may fancy that the more discerning minds\r\nat Berlin now saw the advantage of a policy which would entice the\r\nFrench into the wastes of Muscovy. It is strange that Napoleon's\r\nSyrian adage, \"Never make war against a desert,\" did not now recur to\r\nhis mind. But he gradually steeled himself to the conviction that war\r\nwith Alexander was inevitable, and that the help of Austria and\r\nPrussia would enable him to beat back the Muscovite hordes into their\r\neastern steppes. For a time he had unquestionably thought of\r\ndestroying Prussia before he attacked the Czar; but he finally decided\r\nto postpone her fate until he had used her for the overthrow of\r\nRussia.[257]\r\n\r\nAfter the experiences of Austerlitz and Friedland, the advantages of a\r\ndefensive campaign could not escape the notice of the Czar. As early\r\nas October, 1811, when Scharnhorst was at St. Petersburg, he discussed\r\nthese questions with him; and not all that officer's pleading for the\r\ncause of Prussian independence induced Alexander to offer armed help\r\nunless the French committed a wanton aggression on Königsberg. Seeing\r\nthat there was no hope of bringing the Russians far to the west,\r\nScharnhorst seems finally to have counselled a Fabian strategy for the\r\nensuing war; and, when at Vienna, he drew up a memoir in this sense\r\nfor the guidance of the Czar.[258]\r\n\r\nAlexander was certainly much in need of sound guidance. Though\r\nScharnhorst had pointed out the way of salvation, a strategic tempter\r\nwas soon at hand in the person of General von Phull, an uncompromising\r\ntheorist who planned campaigns with an unquestioning devotion to\r\nabstract principles. Untaught by the catastrophes of the past,\r\nAlexander once more let his enthusiasm for theories and principles\r\nlead him to the brink of the abyss. Phull captivated him by setting\r\nforth the true plan of a defensive campaign which he had evolved from\r\npatient study of the Seven Years' War. Everything depended on the\r\nproper selection of defensive positions and the due disposition of the\r\ndefending armies. There must be two armies of defence, and at least\r\none great intrenched camp. One army must oppose the invader on a line\r\nnear, or leading up to, the camp; while the other army must manoeuvre\r\non his rear or flanks. And the camp must be so placed as to stretch\r\nits protecting influence over one, or more, important roads. It need\r\nnot be on any one of them: in fact, it was better that it should be\r\nsome distance away; for it thus fulfilled better the all-important\r\nfunction of a \"flanking position.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a position Phull had discovered at Drissa in a curve of the River\r\nDwina. It was sufficiently far from the roads leading from the Niemen\r\nto St. Petersburg and to Moscow efficiently to protect them both.\r\nThere, accordingly, he suggested that vast earthworks should be\r\nprepared; for there, at that artificial Torres Vedras, Russia's chief\r\nforce might await the Grand Army, while the other force harassed its\r\nflank or rear.[259]\r\n\r\nNapoleon had not probed this absurdity to its inmost depths: but he\r\nearly found out that the Russians were in two widely separated armies;\r\nand this sufficed to decide his movements and the early part of the\r\ncampaign. Having learnt that one army was near Vilna, and the other in\r\nfront of the marshes of the Pripet, he sought to hold them apart by a\r\nrapid irruption into the intervening space, and thereafter to destroy\r\nthem piecemeal. Never was a visionary theory threatened by a more\r\nterrible realism. For Napoleon at midsummer was mustering a third of a\r\nmillion of men on the banks of the Niemen, while the Russians, with\r\nlittle more than half those numbers as yet available for the\r\nfighting-line, had them spread out over an immense space, so as to\r\nfacilitate those flanking operations on which Phull set such\r\nstore.[260]\r\n\r\nOn the morn of June 23rd, three immense French columns wound their way\r\nto the pontoon bridges hastily thrown over the Niemen near Kovno; and\r\nloud shouts of triumph greeted the great leader as the vanguard set\r\nfoot on Lithuanian soil. No Russians were seen except a few light\r\nhorsemen, who galloped up, inquired of the engineers why they were\r\nbuilding the bridges, and then rode hastily away. During three days\r\nthe Grand Army filed over the river and melted away into the sandy\r\nwastes. No foe at first contested their march, but neither were they\r\nmet by the crowds of downtrodden natives whom their fancy pictured as\r\nthronging to welcome the liberators. In truth, the peasants of\r\nLithuania had no very close racial affinity to the Poles, whose\r\noffshoots were found chiefly among the nobles and the wealthier\r\ntownsfolk. Solitude, the sultry heat of a Russian mid-summer, and\r\ndrenching thunderstorms depressed the spirits of the invaders. The\r\nmiserable cart tracks were at once cut up by the passage of the host,\r\nand 10,000 horses perished of fatigue or of disease caused by the rank\r\ngrass, in the fifty miles' march from the Niemen to Vilna.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of the transport service began at once, and they were\r\nto increase with every day's march. With his usual foresight, Napoleon\r\nhad ordered the collection of immense stores of all kinds at Danzig,\r\nhis chief base of supplies. Two million pairs of boots were required\r\nfor the wear and tear of a long campaign, and all preparations were on\r\nthe same colossal scale. In this connection it is noteworthy that no\r\nsmall proportion of the cloaks and boots came from England, as the\r\nindustrial resources of the Continent were wholly unequal to supplying\r\nthe crusaders of the Continental System.\r\n\r\nA great part of those stores never reached the troops in Russia. The\r\nwherries sent from Danzig to the Niemen were often snapped up by\r\nBritish cruisers, and the carriage of stores from the Niemen entailed\r\nso frightful a waste of horseflesh that only the most absolute\r\nnecessaries could keep pace with the army in its rapid advance. The\r\nmen were thus left without food except such as marauding could extort.\r\nIn this art Napoleon's troops were experts. Many miles of country were\r\nscoured on either side of the line of march, and the Emperor, on\r\nreaching Vilna, had to order Ney to send out cavalry patrols to gather\r\nin the stragglers, who were committing \"horrible devastations\" and\r\nwould \"fall into the hands of the Cossacks.\"\r\n\r\nAt Vilna the Grand Army met with a more cheering reception than\r\nheretofore. Deftly placing his Polish regiments in front and chasing\r\nthe retiring Russians beyond the town, Napoleon then returned to find\r\na welcome in the old Lithuanian capital. The old men came forth clad\r\nin the national garb, and it seemed that that province, once a part of\r\nthe great Polish monarchy, would break away from the empire of the\r\nCzars and extend Napoleon's influence to within a few miles of\r\nSmolensk.[261] The newly-formed Diet at Warsaw also favoured this\r\nproject: it constituted itself into a general confederation, declared\r\nthe Kingdom of Poland to be restored, and sent a deputation to\r\nNapoleon at Vilna begging him to utter the creative words: \"Let the\r\nKingdom of Poland exist.\" The Emperor gave a guarded answer. He\r\ndeclared that he loved the Poles, he commended them for their\r\npatriotism, which was \"the first duty of civilized man,\" but added\r\nthat only by a unanimous effort could they now compel their enemies to\r\nrecognize their rights; and that, having guaranteed the integrity of\r\nthe Austrian Empire, he could not sanction any movement which would\r\ndisturb its remaining Polish provinces.\r\n\r\nThis diplomatic reply chilled his auditors. But what would have been\r\ntheir feelings had they known that the calling of the Diet at Warsaw,\r\nand the tone of its address to Napoleon; had all been sketched out\r\nfive weeks before by the imperial stage manager himself? Yet such was\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nThe scene-shifter was the Abbé de Pradt, Archbishop of Malines, whom\r\nNapoleon sent as ambassador to Warsaw, with elaborate instructions as\r\nto the summoning of the Diet, the whipping-up of Polish enthusiasm,\r\nthe revolutionizing of Russian Poland, and the style of the address to\r\nhim. Nay, his passion for the regulation of details even led him to\r\ninform the ambassador that the imperial reply would be one of praise\r\nof Polish patriotism and of warning that Polish liberty could only be\r\nwon by their \"zeal and their efforts.\" The trickery was like that\r\nwhich he had played upon the Poles shortly before Eylau. In effect, he\r\nsaid now, as then: \"Pour out your blood for me first, and I will do\r\nsomething for you.\" But on this occasion the scenic setting was more\r\nimpressive, the rush of the Poles to arms more ardent, the diplomatic\r\nreply more astutely postponed, and the finale more awful.[262]\r\n\r\nStill, the Poles marched on; but their devotion became more\r\nquestioning. The feelings of the Lithuanians were also ruffled by\r\nNapoleon's reply to the Polish deputies: nor were they consoled by his\r\nappointment of seven magnates to regulate the affairs of the districts\r\nof Lithuania, under the ægis of French commissioners, who proved to be\r\nthe real governors. Worst of all was the marauding of Napoleon's\r\ntroops, who, after their long habituation to the imperial maxim that\r\n\"war must support war,\" could not now see the need of enduring the\r\npangs of hunger in order that Lithuanian enthusiasm might not cool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAMPAIGN IN RUSSIA]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the war had not progressed altogether as he desired. His aim\r\nhad been to conceal his advance across the Niemen, to surprise the two\r\nchief Russian armies while far separated, and thus to end the war on\r\nLithuanian soil by a blow such as he had dealt at Friedland. The\r\nRussian arrangements seemed to favour his plan. Their two chief\r\narrays, that led by the Czar and by General Barclay de Tolly, some\r\n125,000 strong north of Vilna, and that of Prince Bagration mustering\r\nnow about 45,000 effectives, in the province of Volhynia, were\r\nlabouring to carry out the strategy devised by Phull. The former was\r\ndirectly to oppose the march of Napoleon's main army, while the\r\nsmaller Russian force was to operate on its flanks and rear. Such a\r\nplan could only have succeeded in the good old times when war was\r\nconducted according to ceremonious etiquette; it courted destruction\r\nfrom Napoleon. At Vilna the Emperor directed the movements that were\r\nto ensnare Bagration. Already he had urged on the march of Davoust,\r\nwho was to circle round from the north, and the advance of Jerome\r\nBonaparte's Westphalians, who were bidden to hurry on eastwards from\r\nthe town of Grodno on the Upper Niemen. Their convergence would drive\r\nBagration into the almost trackless marshes of the Pripet, whence his\r\nforce would emerge, if at all, as helpless units.\r\n\r\nSuch was Napoleon's plan, and it would have succeeded but for a\r\nmiscalculation in the time needed for Jerome's march. Napoleon\r\nunderrated the difficulties of his advance or else overrated his\r\nbrother's military capacity. The King of Westphalia was delayed a few\r\ndays at Grodno by bad weather and other difficulties; thus Bagration,\r\nwho had been ordered by the Czar to retire, was able to escape the\r\nmeshes closing around him by a speedy retreat to Bobruisk, whence he\r\nmoved northwards. Napoleon was enraged at this loss of a priceless\r\nopportunity, and addressed vehement reproaches to Jerome for his\r\nslowness and \"small-mindedness.\" The youngest of the Bonapartes\r\nresented this rebuke which ignored the difficulties besetting a rapid\r\nadvance. The prospect of being subjected to that prince of martinets,\r\nDavoust, chafed his pride; and, throwing up his command, he forthwith\r\nreturned to the pleasures of Cassel.\r\n\r\nBy great good fortune, Bagration's force had escaped from the snares\r\nstrewn in its path by the strategy of Phull and the counter-moves of\r\nNapoleon. The fickle goddess also favoured the rescue of the chief\r\nRussian army from imminent peril at Drissa. In pursuance of Phull's\r\nscheme, the Czar and Barclay de Tolly fell back with that army towards\r\nthe intrenched camp on the Dwina. But doubts had already begun to\r\nhaunt their minds as to the wisdom of Phull's plans. In fact, the bias\r\nof Barclay's nature was towards the proven and the practical. He came\r\nof a Scottish family which long ago had settled in Livonia, and had\r\nwon prosperity and esteem in the trade of Riga. His ancestry and his\r\nearly surroundings therefore disposed him to the careful weighing of\r\nevidence and distrust of vague theories. His thoroughness in military\r\norganization during the war in Finland and his unquestioned probity\r\nand open-mindedness, had recently brought him high into favour with\r\nthe Czar, who made him War Minister. He had no wide acquaintance with\r\nthe science of warfare, and has been judged altogether deficient in a\r\nwide outlook on events and in those masterly conceptions which mark\r\nthe great warrior.[263] But nations are sometimes ruined by lofty\r\ngenius, while at times they may be saved by humdrum prudence; and\r\nBarclay's common sense had no small share in saving Russia.\r\n\r\nTwo months before the Grand Army passed the Niemen, he had expressed\r\nthe hope that God would send retreat to the Russian armies; and we may\r\nsafely attribute to his influence with the Czar the timely order to\r\nBagration to desist from flanking tactics and beat a retreat while yet\r\nthere was time. That portion of Phull's strategy having signally\r\nfailed, Alexander naturally became more suspicious about the Drissa\r\nplan; and during the retirement from Vilna, he ordered a survey of the\r\nworks to be made by Phull's adjutant, a young German named Clausewitz,\r\nwho was destined to win a name as an authority in strategy. This\r\nofficer was unable conscientiously to present a cheering report. He\r\nfound the camp deficient in many respects. Nevertheless, Alexander\r\nstill clung to the hope of checking the French advance before these\r\ngreat intrenchments.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival there, on July 8th, this hope also was dashed. Michaud,\r\na young Sardinian engineer, pointed out several serious defects in\r\ntheir construction. Barclay also protested against shutting up a large\r\npart of the defending army in a camp which could easily be blockaded\r\nby Napoleon's vast forces. Finally, as the Russian reserves stationed\r\nthere proved to be disappointingly weak both in numbers and\r\nefficiency, the Czar determined to evacuate the camp, intrust the sole\r\ncommand to Barclay, and retire to his northern capital. It is said\r\nthat, before he left the army, the Grand Duke Constantine, a friend of\r\nthe French cause, made a last effort to induce him to come to terms\r\nwith Napoleon, now that the plan of campaign had failed. If so,\r\nAlexander repelled the attempt. Pride as a ruler and a just resentment\r\nagainst Napoleon prevented any compromise; and probably he now saw\r\nthat safety for himself and ruin for his foe lay in the firm adoption\r\nof that Fabian policy of retreat and delay, which Scharnhorst had\r\nadvocated and Barclay was now determined to carry out.\r\n\r\nThough still hampered by the intrigues of Constantine, Bennigsen, and\r\nother generals, who hated him as a foreigner and feigned to despise\r\nhim as a coward, Barclay at once took the step which he had long felt\r\nto be necessary; he ordered a retreat which would bring him into touch\r\nwith Bagration. Accordingly, leaving Wittgenstein with 25,000 men to\r\nhold Oudinot's corps in check on the middle Dwina, he marched\r\neastwards towards Vitepsk. True, he left St. Petersburg open to\r\nattack; but it was not likely that Napoleon, when the summer was far\r\nspent, would press so far north and forego his usual plan of striking\r\nat the enemy's chief forces. He would certainly seek to hinder the\r\njunction of the two Russian armies, as soon as he saw that this was\r\nBarclay's aim. Such proved to be the case. Napoleon soon penetrated\r\nhis design, and strove to frustrate it by a rapid move from Vilna\r\ntowards Polotsk on Barclay's flank, but he failed to cut into his line\r\nof march, and once more had to pursue.\r\n\r\nDespite the heavy shrinkage in the Grand Army caused by a remorseless\r\nrush through a country wellnigh stripped of supplies, the Emperor\r\nsought to force on a general engagement. He hoped to catch Barclay at\r\nVitepsk. \"The whole Russian army is at Vitepsk--we are on the eve of\r\ngreat events,\" he writes on July 25th. But the Russians skilfully\r\nwithdrew by night from their position in front of that town, which he\r\nentered on July 28th. Chagrined and perplexed, the chief stays a\r\nfortnight to organize supplies and stores, while his vanguard presses\r\non to envelop the Russians at Smolensk. Again his hopes revive when he\r\nhears that Barclay and Bagration are about to join near that city. In\r\nfact, those leaders there concluded that strategic movement to the\r\nrear which was absolutely necessary if they were not to be overwhelmed\r\nsingly. They viewed the retreat in a very different light. To the\r\ncautious Barclay it portended a triumph long deferred, but sure: while\r\nthe more impulsive Muscovite looked upon the constant falling back as\r\na national disgrace.\r\n\r\nThe feelings of the soldiery also forbade a spiritless abandonment of\r\nthe holy city of the Upper Dnieper that stands as sentinel to Russia\r\nProper. On these feelings Napoleon counted, and rightly. He was now in\r\nno haste to strike: the blow must be crushing and final. At last he\r\nhears that Davoust, the leader whose devotion and methodical\r\npersistence merit his complete trust, has bridged the River Dnieper\r\nbelow the city, and has built ovens for supplying the host with bread.\r\nAnd having now drawn up troops and supplies from the rear, he pushes\r\non to end the campaign.\r\n\r\nBarclay was still for retreat; but religious sentiment and patriotism\r\nbade the defenders stand firm behind those crumbling walls, while\r\nBagration secured the line of retreat. The French, ranged\r\naround on the low hills which ring it on the south, looked for an easy\r\ntriumph, and Napoleon seems to have felt an excess of confidence. At\r\nany rate, his dispositions were far from masterly. He made no serious\r\neffort to threaten the Russian communications with Moscow, nor did he\r\nwait for his artillery to overwhelm the ramparts and their defenders.\r\nThe corps of Ney, Davoust, and Poniatowski, with Murat's cavalry and\r\nthe Imperial Guard posted in reserve, promised an easy victory, and\r\nthe dense columns of foot moved eagerly to the assault. They were\r\nreceived with a terrific fire. Only after three hours' desperate\r\nfighting did they master the southern suburbs, and at nightfall the\r\nwalls still defied their assaults. Yet in the meantime Napoleon's\r\ncannon had done their work. The wooden houses were everywhere on fire;\r\na speedy retreat alone could save the garrison from ruin; and amidst a\r\nwhirlwind of flame and smoke Barclay drew off his men to join\r\nBagration on the road to Moscow (August 17th).\r\n\r\nOnce more, then, the Russian army had slipped from Napoleon's grasp,\r\nthough this time it dealt him a loss of 12,000 in killed or wounded.\r\nAnd the momentous question faced him whether he should halt, now that\r\nsummer was on the wane, or snatch under the walls of Moscow the\r\ntriumph which Vilna, Vitepsk, and Smolensk had promised and denied. It\r\nis stated by that melodramatic narrator, Count Philip Ségur, that on\r\nentering Vitepsk, the Emperor exclaimed: \"The campaign of 1812 is\r\nended, that of 1813 will do the rest.\" But the whole of Napoleon's\r\n\"Correspondence\" refutes the anecdote. Besides, it was not Napoleon's\r\nhabit to go into winter quarters in July, or to rest before he had\r\ndefeated the enemy's main army.[264]\r\n\r\nAt Smolensk the question wore another aspect. Napoleon told Metternich\r\nat Dresden that he would not in the present year advance beyond\r\nSmolensk, but would organize Lithuania during winter and advance again\r\nin the spring of 1813, adding: \"My enterprise is one of those of which\r\nthe solution is to be found in patience.\" A policy of masterly\r\ninactivity certainly commended itself to his Marshals. But the desire\r\nto crush the enemy's rear drew Ney and Murat into a sharp affair at\r\nValutino or Lubino: the French lost heavily, but finally gained the\r\nposition: and the hope that the foe were determined to fight the\r\ndecisive battle at Dorogobuzh lured Napoleon on, despite his earlier\r\ndecision.[265] Besides, his position seemed less hazardous than it was\r\nbefore Austerlitz. The Grand Army was decidedly superior to the united\r\nforces of Barclay and Bagration. On the Dwina, Oudinot held the\r\nRussians at bay; and when he was wounded, his successor, Gouvion St.\r\nCyr, displayed a tactical skill which enabled him easily to foil a\r\nmere fighter like Wittgenstein. On the French right flank, affairs\r\nwere less promising; for the ending of the Russo-Turkish war now left\r\nthe Russian army of the Pruth free to march into Volhynia. But, for\r\nthe present, Napoleon was able to summon up strong reserves under\r\nVictor, and assure his rear.\r\n\r\nWith full confidence, then, he pressed onwards to wrest from Fortune\r\none last favour. It was granted to him at Borodino. There the Russians\r\nmade a determined stand. National jealousy of Barclay, inflamed by his\r\nprotracted retreat, had at last led to his being superseded by\r\nKutusoff; and, having about 110,000 troops, the old fighting general\r\nnow turned fiercely to bay. His position on the low convex curve of\r\nhills that rise behind the village of Borodino was of great strength.\r\nOn his right was the winding valley of the Kolotza, an affluent of the\r\nMoskwa, and before his centre and left the ground sloped down to a\r\nstream. On this more exposed side the Russians had hastily thrown up\r\nearthworks, that at the centre being known as the Great Redoubt,\r\nthough it had no rear defences.\r\n\r\nNapoleon halted for two days, until his gathering forces mustered some\r\n125,000 men, and he now prepared to end the war at a blow. After\r\nsurveying the Russian position, he saw Kutusoff's error in widely\r\nextending his lines to the north; and while making feints on that\r\nside, so as to prevent any concentration of the Muscovite array, he\r\nplanned to overwhelm the more exposed centre and left, by the assaults\r\nof Davoust and Poniatowski on the south, and of Ney's corps and\r\nEugène's Italians on the redoubts at the centre. Davoust begged to be\r\nallowed to outflank the Russian left; but Napoleon refused, perhaps\r\nowing to a fear that the Russians might retreat early in the day, and\r\ndecided on dealing direct blows at the left and centre. As the 7th of\r\nSeptember dawned with all the splendour of a protracted summer, cannon\r\nbegan to thunder against the serried arrays ranged along the opposing\r\nslopes, and Napoleon's columns moved against the redoubts and woods\r\nthat sheltered the Muscovite lines. The defence was most obstinate.\r\nTime after time the smaller redoubts were taken and retaken; and\r\nwhile, on the French right centre, the tide of battle surged up and\r\ndown the slope, the Great Redoubt dealt havoc among Eugène's Italians,\r\nwho bravely but, as it seemed, hopelessly struggled up that fatal\r\nrise.\r\n\r\nThen was seen a soul-stirring sight. Of a sudden, a mass of\r\nCuirassiers rushed forth from the invaders' ranks, flung itself\r\nuphill, and girdled the grim earthwork with a stream of flashing steel\r\nThere, for a brief space, it was stayed by the tough Muscovite lines,\r\nuntil another billow of horsemen, marshalled by Grouchy and Chastel,\r\nswept all before it, took the redoubt on its weak reverse, and\r\noverwhelmed its devoted defenders.[266] In vain did the Russian\r\ncavalry seek to save the day: Murat's horsemen were not to be denied,\r\nand Kutusoff was at last fain to draw back his mangled lines, but\r\nslowly and defiantly, under cover of a crushing artillery fire.\r\n\r\nThus ended the bloodiest fight of the century. For several hours 800\r\ncannon had dealt death among the opposing masses; the Russians lost\r\nabout 40,000 men, and, whatever Napoleon said in his bulletins, the\r\nrents in his array were probably nearly as great. He has been censured\r\nfor not launching his Guard at the wavering foe at the climax of the\r\nfight; and the soldiery loudly blamed its commander, Bessières, for\r\ndissuading his master from this step. But to have sacrificed those\r\nveterans to Russian cannon would have been a perilous act.[267] His\r\nGuard was the solid kernel of his army: on it he could always rely,\r\neven when French regulars dissolved, as often happened after long\r\nmarches, into bands of unruly marauders; and its value was to be found\r\nout during the retreat. More fitly may Napoleon be blamed for not\r\nseeking earlier in the day to turn the Russian left, and roll that\r\nlong line up on the river. Here, as at Smolensk, he resorted to a\r\nfrontal attack, which could only yield success at a frightful cost.\r\nThe day brought little glory to the generals, except to Ney, Murat,\r\nand Grouchy. For his valour in the _mêlée_, Ney received the title of\r\nPrince de la Moskwa.\r\n\r\nA week before this Pyrrhic triumph, Napoleon had heard of a terrible\r\nreverse to French arms in Spain. His old friend, Marmont, who had won\r\nthe Marshal's baton after Wagram, measured his strength with\r\nWellington in the plains of Leon with brilliant success until a false\r\nmove near Salamanca exposed him to a crushing rejoinder, and sent his\r\narmy flying back towards Burgos. Madrid was now uncovered and was\r\noccupied for a time by the English army (August 13th). Thus while\r\nNapoleon was gasping at Moscow, his brother was expelled from Madrid,\r\nuntil the recall of Soult from Andalusia gave the French a superiority\r\nin the centre of Spain which forced Wellington to retire to Ciudad\r\nRodrigo. He lost the fruits of his victory, save that Andalusia was\r\nfreed: but he saved his army for the triumphant campaign of 1813. Had\r\nNapoleon shown the like prudence by beating a timely retreat from\r\nMoscow, who can say that the next hard-fought fights in Silesia and\r\nSaxony would not have once more crowned his veterans with decisive\r\ntriumph?\r\n\r\nAs it was, the Grand Army toiled on through heat, dust, and the smoke\r\nof burning villages, to gain peace and plenty at Moscow. But when, on\r\nSeptember the 14th, the conqueror entered that city with his vanguard,\r\nsolitude reigned almost unbroken. A few fanatics, clinging to the\r\ntradition that the Kremlin was impregnable, idly sought to defend it;\r\nbut troops, officials, nobles, merchants, and the great mass of the\r\npeople were gone, and the military stores had been burnt or removed.\r\nRostopchin, the governor, had released the prisoners and broken the\r\nfire engines. Flames speedily burst forth, and Bausset, the Prefect of\r\nNapoleon's Palace, affirms that while looking forth from the Kremlin\r\nhe saw the flames burst forth in several districts in quick\r\nsuccession; and that a careful examination of cellars often proved\r\nthem to be stored with combustibles, vitriol in one case being\r\nswallowed by a French soldier who took it for brandy! If all this be\r\ntrue, it proves that the Muscovites were determined to fire their\r\ncapital. But their writers have as stoutly affirmed that the fires\r\nwere caused by French and Polish plunderers.[268] Three days later,\r\nthe powers of the air and the demons of drink and frenzy raged\r\nuncontrolled; and Napoleon himself barely escaped from the whirlwinds\r\nof flame that enveloped the Kremlin and nearly scorched to death the\r\nlast members of his staff. For several hours the conflagration was\r\nfanned by an equinoctial gale, and when, on the 20th, it died down,\r\nconvicts or plunderers kindled it anew.\r\n\r\nYet the army did not want for shelter, and, as Sergeant Bourgogne\r\nremarks, if every house had been gutted there were still the caves and\r\ncellars that promised protection from the cold of winter. The real\r\nproblem was now, as ever, the food-supply. The Russians had swept the\r\ndistrict wellnigh bare; and though the Grand Army feasted for a\r\nfortnight on dainties and drink, yet bread, flour, and meat were soon\r\nvery scarce. In vain did the Emperor seek to entice the inhabitants\r\nback; they knew the habits of the invaders only too well; and despite\r\nseveral distant raids, which sometimes cost the French dear, the\r\nsoldiery began to suffer.\r\n\r\nOctober wore on with delusive radiance, but brought no peace. Soon\r\nafter the great conflagration at Moscow, Napoleon sent secret and\r\nalluring overtures to Alexander, offering to leave Russia a free hand\r\nin regard to Turkey, inclusive of Constantinople, which he had\r\nhitherto strictly reserved, and hinting that Polish affairs might also\r\nbe arranged to the Czar's liking.[269] But Alexander refused tamely to\r\naccept the fruits of victory from the man who, he believed, had burnt\r\nholy Moscow, and clung to his vow never to treat with his rival as\r\nlong as a single French soldier stood on Russian soil. His resolve\r\nsaved Europe. Yet it cost him much to defy the great conqueror to the\r\ndeath: he had so far feared the capture of St. Petersburg as to\r\nrequest that the Cronstadt fleet might be kept in safety in\r\nEngland.[270] But gradually he came to see that the sacrifice of\r\nMoscow had saved his empire and lured Napoleon to his doom. Kutusoff\r\nalso played a waiting game. Affecting a wish for peace, he was about\r\nsecretly to meet Napoleon's envoy, Lauriston, when the Russian\r\ngenerals and our commissioner, Sir R. Wilson, intervened, and required\r\nthat it should be a public step. It seems likely, however, that\r\nKutusoff was only seeking to entrap the French into barren\r\nnegotiations; he knew that an answer could not come from the banks of\r\nthe Neva until winter began to steal over the northern steppes.\r\n\r\nSlowly the truth begins to dawn on Napoleon that Moscow is not _the\r\nheart of Russia_, as he had asserted to De Pradt that it was.\r\nGradually he sees that that primitive organism had no heart, that its\r\nalmost amorphous life was widespread through myriads of village\r\ncommunes, vegetating apart from Moscow or Petersburg, and that his\r\nmarch to the old capital was little more than a sword-slash through a\r\npond.[271] Had he set himself to study with his former care the real\r\nnature of the hostile organism, he would certainly never have ventured\r\nbeyond Smolensk in the present year. But he had now merged the thinker\r\nin the conqueror, and--sure sign of coming disaster--his mind no\r\nlonger accurately gauged facts, it recast them in its own mould.\r\n\r\nBy long manipulation of men and events, it had framed a dogma of\r\npersonal infallibility. This vice had of late been growing on him\r\napace. It was apparent even in trifles. The Countess Metternich\r\ndescribes how, early in 1810, he persisted in saying that Kaunitz was\r\nher brother, in spite of her frequent disclaimers of that honour; and,\r\nsomewhat earlier, Marmont noticed with half-amused dismay that when\r\nthe Emperor gave a wrong estimate of the numbers of a certain corps,\r\nno correction had the slightest effect on him; his mind always\r\nreverted to the first figure. In weightier matters this peculiarity\r\nwas equally noticeable. His clinging to preconceived notions, however\r\nunfair or burdensome they were to Britain, Prussia, or Austria, had\r\nbeen the underlying cause of his wars with those Powers. And now this\r\nsame defect, burnt into his being by the blaze of a hundred victories,\r\nheld him to Moscow for five weeks, in the belief that Russia was\r\nstricken unto death, and that the facile Czar whom he had known at\r\nTilsit would once more bend the knee. An idle hope. \"I have learnt to\r\nknow him now,\" said the Czar, \"Napoleon or I; I or Napoleon; we cannot\r\nreign side by side.\" Buoyed up by religious faith and by his people's\r\nheroism, Alexander silently defied the victor of Moscow and rebuked\r\nKutusoff for receiving the French envoy.\r\n\r\nAt last, on October 18th, the Russians threw away the scabbard and\r\nsurprised Murat's force some forty miles south of Moscow, inflicting a\r\nloss of 3,000 men. But already, a day or two earlier, Napoleon had\r\nrealized the futility of his hope of peace and had resolved to\r\nretreat. The only alternative was to winter at Moscow, and he judged\r\nthat the state of French and Spanish affairs rendered such a course\r\nperilous. He therefore informed Maret that the Grand Army would go\r\ninto winter quarters between the Dnieper and the Dwina.[272]\r\n\r\nThere is no hint in his letters that he anticipated a disastrous\r\nretreat. The weather hitherto had been \"as fine as that at\r\nFontainebleau in September,\" and he purposed retiring by a more\r\nsoutherly route which had not been exhausted by war. Full of\r\nconfidence, then, he set out on the 19th, with 115,000 men, persuaded\r\nthat he would easily reach friendly Lithuania and his winter quarters\r\n\"before severe cold set in.\" The veil was rudely torn from his eyes\r\nwhen, south of Malo-Jaroslavitz, his Marshals found the Russians so\r\nstrongly posted that any further attack seemed to be an act of folly.\r\nEugène's corps had suffered cruelly in an obstinate fight in and\r\naround that town, and the advice of Berthier, Murat, and Bessières was\r\nagainst its renewal. For an hour or more the Emperor sat silently\r\ngazing at a map. The only prudent course now left was to retreat north\r\nand then west by way of Borodino, _over his devastated line of\r\nadvance_.[273] Back, then, towards Borodino the army mournfully\r\ntrudged (October 26th):\r\n\r\n    \"Everywhere (says Labaume) we saw wagons abandoned for want of\r\n    horses to draw them. Those who bore along with them the spoils of\r\n    Moscow trembled for their riches; but we were disquieted most of\r\n    all at seeing the deplorable state of our cavalry. The villages\r\n    which had but lately given us shelter were level with the ground:\r\n    under their ashes were the bodies of hundreds of soldiers and\r\n    peasants.... But most horrible was the field of Borodino, where we\r\n    saw the forty thousand men, who had perished there, yet lying\r\n    unburied.\"\r\n\r\nFor a time, Kutusoff forbore to attack the sore-stricken host; but,\r\nearly in November, the Russian horse began to infest the line of\r\nmarch, and at Viasma their gathering forces were barely held off: had\r\nKutusoff aided his lieutenants, he might have decimated his famished\r\nfoes.\r\n\r\nHitherto the weather had been singularly mild and open, so much so\r\nthat the superstitious peasants looked on it as a sign that God was\r\nfavouring Napoleon. But, at last, on November the 6th, the first storm\r\nof winter fell on the straggling array, and completed its miseries.\r\nThe icy blasts struck death to the hearts of the feeble; and the puny\r\nfighting of man against man was now merged in the awful struggle\r\nagainst the powers of the air. Drifts of snow blotted out the\r\nlandscape; the wandering columns often lost the road and thousands\r\nforthwith ended their miseries. Except among the Old Guard all\r\nsemblance of military order was now lost, and battalions melted away\r\ninto groups of marauders.\r\n\r\nThe search for food and fuel became furious, even when the rigour of\r\nthe cold abated. The behaviour of Bourgogne, a sergeant in the\r\nImperial Guard, may serve to show by what shifts a hardy masterful\r\nnature fought its way through the wreckage of humanity around: \"If I\r\ncould meet anybody in the world with a loaf, I would make him give me\r\nhalf--nay, I would kill him so as to get the whole.\" These were his\r\nfeelings: he acted on them by foraging in the forest and seizing a pot\r\nin which an orderly was secretly cooking potatoes for his general.\r\nBourgogne made off with the potatoes, devoured most of them\r\nhalf-boiled, returned to his comrades and told them he had found\r\nnothing. Taking his place near their fire, he scooped out his bed in\r\nthe snow, lay under his bearskin, and clasped his now precious\r\nknapsack, while the others moaned with hunger. Yet, as his narrative\r\nshows, he was not naturally a heartless man: in such a situation man\r\nis apt to sink to the level of the wolf. The best food obtainable was\r\nhorseflesh, and hungry throngs rushed at every horse that fell,\r\ndisputing its carcass with the packs of dogs or wolves that hung about\r\nthe line of march.[274]\r\n\r\nSmolensk was now the thought dearest to every heart; and, buoyed with\r\nthe hope of rest and food, the army tottered westwards as it had\r\npanted eastwards through the fierce summer heats with Moscow as its\r\ncynosure. The hope that clung about Smolensk was but a cruel mirage.\r\nThe wreck of that city offered poor shelter; the stores were exhausted\r\nby the vanguard; and, to the horror of Eugène's Italians, men swarmed\r\nout of that fancied abode of plenty and pounced on every horse that\r\nstumbled to its doom on the slippery banks of the Dnieper. With\r\ninconceivable folly, Napoleon, or his staff, had provided no means for\r\nroughing the horses' shoes. The Cossacks, when they knew this,\r\nexclaimed to Wilson: \"God has made Napoleon forget that there was a\r\nwinter here.\"\r\n\r\nDisasters now thickened about the Grand Army. During his halt at\r\nSmolensk (November 9th-14th), Napoleon heard that Victor's force on\r\nthe Dwina had been worsted by the Russians, and there was ground for\r\nfearing that the Muscovite army of the Ukraine would cut into the line\r\nof retreat. The halt at Smolensk also gave time for Kutusoff to come\r\nup parallel with the main force, and had he pressed on with ordinary\r\nspeed and showed a tithe of his wonted pugnacity, he might have\r\ncaptured the Grand Army and its leader. As it was, his feeble attack\r\non the rearguard at Krasnoe only gave Ney an opportunity of showing\r\nhis dauntless courage. The \"bravest of the brave\" fought his way\r\nthrough clouds of Cossacks, crossed the Dnieper, though with the loss\r\nof all his guns, and rejoined the main body. Napoleon was greatly\r\nrelieved on hearing of the escape of this Launcelot of the Imperial\r\nchivalry. He ordered cannon to be fired at suitable intervals so as to\r\nforward the news if it were propitious; and on hearing their distant\r\nboomings, he exclaimed to his officers: \"I have more than 400,000,000\r\nfrancs in the cellars of the Tuileries, and would gladly have given\r\nthe whole for the ransom of my faithful companion in arms.\"[275]\r\n\r\nFar greater was the danger at the River Beresina. The Russian army of\r\nthe south had seized the bridge at Borisoff on which Napoleon's safety\r\ndepended, and Oudinot vainly struggled to wrest it back. The\r\nMuscovites burnt it under his eyes. Such was the news which Napoleon\r\nheard at Bobr on November 24th. It staggered him; for, with his usual\r\nexcess of confidence, he had destroyed his pontoons on the banks of\r\nthe Dnieper; and now there was no means of crossing a river, usually\r\ninsignificant, but swollen by floods and bridged only by half-thawed\r\nice. Yet French resource was far from vanquished. General Corbineau,\r\nfinding from some peasants that the river was fordable three leagues\r\nabove Borisoff, brought the news to Oudinot, who forthwith prepared to\r\ncross there. Napoleon, coming up on the 26th, approved the plan, and\r\ncheeringly said to his Marshal, \"Well, you shall be my locksmith and\r\nopen that passage for me.\"[276]\r\n\r\nTo deceive the foe, the Emperor told off a regiment or two southwards\r\nwith a long tail of camp-followers that were taken to be an army. And\r\nthis wily move, harmonizing with recent demonstrations of the\r\nAustrians on the side of Minsk, convinced the Muscovite leader that\r\nNapoleon was minded to clasp hands with them.[277] While the Russians\r\npatrolled the river on the south, French sappers were working, often\r\nneck deep in the water, to throw two light bridges across the stream\r\nhigher up. By heroic toil, which to most of them brought death, the\r\nbridges were speedily finished, and, as the light of November 26th was\r\nwaning Oudinot's corps of 7,000 men gained a firm footing on the\r\nhomeward side. But they were observed by Russian scouts, and when on\r\nthe next day Napoleon and other corps had struggled across, the enemy\r\ncame up, captured a whole division, and on the morrow strove to hurl\r\nthe invaders into the river. Victor and the rearguard staunchly kept\r\nthem at bay; but at one point the Russian army of the Dwina\r\ntemporarily gained ground and swept the bridges and their approaches\r\nwith artillery fire.\r\n\r\nThen the panic-stricken throngs of wounded and stragglers, women and\r\ncamp-followers, writhed and fought their way until the frail planks\r\nwere piled high with living and dead. To add to the horrors, one\r\nbridge gave way under the weight of the cannon. The rush for the one\r\nremaining bridge became yet more frantic and the day closed amidst\r\nscenes of unspeakable woe. Stout swimmers threw themselves into the\r\nstream, only to fall victims to the ice floes and the numbing cold. At\r\ndawn of the 29th, the French rearguard fired the bridge to cover the\r\nretreat. Then a last, loud wail of horror arose from the farther bank,\r\nand despair or a loathing of life drove many to end their miseries in\r\nthe river or in the flames.\r\n\r\nSuch was the crossing of the Beresina. The ghastly tale was told once\r\nmore with renewed horrors when the floods of winter abated and laid\r\nbare some 12,000 corpses along the course of that fatal stream. It\r\nwould seem that if Napoleon, or his staff, had hurried on the\r\ncamp-followers to cross on the night of the 27th to the 28th, those\r\nawful scenes would not have happened, for on that night the bridges\r\n_were not used at all_. Grosser carelessness than this cannot be\r\nconceived; and yet, even after this shocking blunder, the devotion of\r\nthe soldiers to their chief found touching expression. When he was\r\nsuffering from cold in the wretched bivouac west of the river,\r\nofficers went round calling for dry wood for his fire; and shivering\r\nmen were seen to offer precious sticks, with the words, \"Take it for\r\nthe Emperor.\"[278]\r\n\r\nOn that day Napoleon wrote to Maret that possibly he would leave the\r\narmy and hurry on to Paris. His presence there was certainly needed,\r\nif his crown was to be saved. On November 6th, the day of the first\r\nsnowstorm, he heard of the Quixotic attempt of a French republican,\r\nGeneral Malet, to overthrow the Government at Paris. With a handful of\r\nfollowers, but armed with a false report of Napoleon's capture in\r\nRussia, this man had apprehended several officials, until the scheme\r\ncollapsed of sheer inanity.[279] \"How now, if we were at Moscow,\"\r\nexclaimed the Emperor, on hearing this curious news; and he saw with\r\nchagrin that some of his generals merely shrugged their shoulders.\r\nAfter crossing the Beresina, he might hope that the worst was over and\r\nthat the stores at Vilna and Kovno would suffice for the remnant of\r\nhis army. The cold for a time had been less rigorous. The behaviour of\r\nPrussia and Austria was, in truth, more important than the conduct of\r\nthe retreat. Unless those Powers were kept to their troth, not a\r\nFrenchman would cross the Elbe.\r\n\r\nAt Smorgoni, then, on December the 5th, he informed his Marshals that\r\nhe left them in order to raise 300,000 men; and, intrusting the\r\ncommand to Murat, he hurried away. His great care was to prevent the\r\nextent of the disaster being speedily known. \"Remove all strangers\r\nfrom Vilna,\" he wrote to Maret: \"the army is not fine to look upon\r\njust now.\" The precaution was much needed. Frost set in once more, and\r\nnow with unending grip. Vilna offered a poor haven of refuge. The\r\nstores were soon plundered, and, as the Cossacks drew near, Murat and\r\nthe remnant of the Grand Army decamped in pitiable panic. Amidst ever\r\ndeepening misery they struggled on, until, of the 600,000 men who had\r\nproudly crossed the Niemen for the conquest of Russia, only 20,000\r\nfamished, frost-bitten, unarmed spectres staggered across the bridge\r\nof Kovno in the middle of December. The auxiliary corps furnished by\r\nAustria and Prussia fell back almost unscathed. But the remainder of\r\nthat mighty host rotted away in Russian prisons or lay at rest under\r\nNature's winding-sheet of snow.[280]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST SAXON CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite the loss of the most splendid army ever marshalled by man,\r\nNapoleon abated no whit of his resolve to dominate Germany and dictate\r\nterms to Russia. At Warsaw, in his retreat, he informed De Pradt that\r\nthere was but one step from the sublime _to the ridiculous_, that is,\r\nfrom the advance on Moscow to the retreat. At Dresden he called on his\r\nallies, Austria and Prussia, to repel the Russians; and at Paris he\r\nstrained every nerve to call the youth of the Empire to arms. The\r\nsummons met with a ready response: he had but to stamp his foot when\r\nthe news from East Prussia looked ominous, and an array of 350,000\r\nconscripts was promised by the Senate (January 10th).\r\n\r\nIn truth, his genius had enthralled the mind of France. The\r\nmagnificence of his aims, his hitherto triumphant energy, and the\r\nglamour of his European supremacy had called forth all the faculties\r\nof the French and Italian peoples, and set them pulsating with\r\necstatic activity. He knew by instinct all the intricacies of their\r\nbeing, which his genius controlled with the easy decisiveness of a\r\nmaster-key. The rude shock of the Russian disaster served but to\r\nemphasize the thoroughness of his domination, and the dumb\r\ntrustfulness of his forty-three millions of subjects.\r\n\r\nAnd yet their patience might well have been exhausted. His military\r\nneeds had long ago drawn in levies the year before they were legally\r\nliable; but the mighty swirl of the Moscow campaign now sucked 150,000\r\nlads of under twenty years of age into the devouring vortex. In the\r\nDutch and German provinces of his Empire the number of those who\r\nevaded the clutches of the conscription was very large. In fact, the\r\nnumber of \"refractory conscripts\" in the whole realm amounted to\r\n40,000. Large bands of them ranged the woods of Brittany and La\r\nVendée, until mobile columns were sent to sweep them into the\r\nbarracks.\r\n\r\nBut in nearly the whole of France (Proper), Napoleon's name was still\r\nan unfailing talisman, appealing as it did to the two strongest\r\ninstincts of the Celt, the clinging to the soil and the passion for\r\nheroic enterprise. Thus it came about that the peasantry gave up their\r\nsons to be \"food for cannon\" with the same docility that was shown by\r\nsoldiers who sank death-stricken into a snowy bed with no word of\r\nreproach to the author of their miseries. A like obsequiousness was\r\nshown by the officials and legislators of France, who meekly listened\r\nto the Emperor's reproaches for their weakness in the Malet affair,\r\nand heard with mild surprise his denunciation against republican\r\nidealogy--_the cloudy metaphysics to which all the misfortunes of our\r\nfair France may be attributed_. No tongue dared to utter the retort\r\nwhich must have fermented in every brain.[281]\r\n\r\nBut his explanations and appeals did not satisfy every Frenchman. Many\r\nwere appalled at the frightful drain on the nation's strength. They\r\nasked in private how the deficit of 1812 and the further expenses of\r\n1813 were to be met, even if he allotted the communal domains to the\r\nservice of the State. They pointed to allies ruined or lost; to Spain,\r\nwhere Joseph's throne still tottered from the shock of Salamanca; to\r\nPoland, lying mangled at the feet of the Muscovites; to Italy,\r\ndesolated by the loss of her bravest sons; to the Confederation of the\r\nRhine, equally afflicted and less resigned; to Austria and Prussia,\r\nwhere timid sovereigns and calculating Courts alone kept the peoples\r\ntrue to the hated French alliance. Only by a change of system, they\r\naverred, could the hatred of Europe be appeased, and the formation of\r\na new and vaster Coalition avoided. Let Napoleon cease to force his\r\nmethods of commercial warfare on the Continent: let him make peace on\r\nhonourable terms with Russia, where the chief Minister, Romantzoff,\r\nwas ready to meet him halfway: let him withdraw his garrisons from\r\nPrussian fortresses, soothe the susceptibilities of Austria--and\r\nevents would tend to a solid and honourable peace.\r\n\r\nTo all promptings of prudence Napoleon was deaf. His instincts and his\r\nexperience of the Kings prevented him yielding on any important point.\r\nHe determined to carry on the war from the Tagus to the Vistula, to\r\nbolster up Joseph in Spain, to keep his garrisons fast rooted in every\r\nfortress as far east as Danzig. Russia and Prussia, he said, had more\r\nneed of peace than France. If he began by giving up towns, they would\r\ndemand kingdoms, whereas by yielding nothing he would intimidate them.\r\nAnd if they did form a league, their forces would be thinly spread out\r\nover an immense space; he would easily dispose of their armies when\r\nthey were not aided by the climate; and a single victory would undo\r\nthe clumsy knot (_ce noeud mal assorti_).[282]\r\n\r\nIn truth, if he left Spain out of his count, the survey of the\r\nmilitary position was in many ways reassuring. England's power was\r\nenfeebled by the declaration of war by the United States. In Central\r\nEurope his position was still commanding. He held nearly all the\r\nfortresses of Prussia, and though he had lost a great army, that loss\r\nwas spread out very largely over Poles, Germans, Italians, and smaller\r\npeoples. Many of the best French troops and all his ablest generals\r\nhad survived. His Guard could therefore be formed again, and the\r\nbrains of his army were also intact. The war had brought to light no\r\nmilitary genius among the Russians; and all his past experience of the\r\n\"old coalition machines\" warranted the belief that their rusty\r\ncogwheels, even if oiled by English subsidies, would clank slowly\r\nalong and break down at the first exceptional strain. Such had been\r\nthe case at Marengo, at Austerlitz, at Friedland. Why should not\r\nhistory repeat itself?\r\n\r\nWhile he was guiding his steps solely by the light of past experience,\r\nevents were occurring that heralded the dawn of a new era for Central\r\nEurope. On the 30th of December, the Prussian General Yorck, who led\r\nthe Prussian corps serving previously under Macdonald in Courland,\r\nconcluded the Convention of Tauroggen with the Russians, stipulating\r\nthat this corps should hold the district around Memel and Tilsit as\r\nneutral territory, until Frederick William's decision should be known.\r\nStrictly considered, this convention was a grave breach of\r\ninternational law and an act of treachery towards Napoleon. The King\r\nat first viewed it in that light; but to all his subjects it seemed a\r\nnoble and patriotic action. To continue the war with Russia for the\r\nbenefit of Napoleon would have been an act of political suicide.\r\n\r\nYet, for some weeks, Frederick William waited on events; and these\r\nevents decided for war, not against Russia, but against France. The\r\nPrussian Chancellor, Hardenberg, did his best to hoodwink the French\r\nat Berlin, and quietly to play into the hands of the ardent German\r\npatriots. After publishing an official rebuke to Yorck, he secretly\r\nsent Major Thile to reassure him. He did more: in order to rescue the\r\nKing from French influence, still paramount at Berlin, he persuaded\r\nhim to set out for Breslau, on the pretext of raising there another\r\ncontingent for service under Napoleon. The ruse completely succeeded:\r\nit deceived the French ambassador, St. Marsan: it fooled even Napoleon\r\nhimself. With his now invariable habit of taking for granted that\r\nevents would march according to his word of command, the Emperor\r\nassumed that this was for the raising of the corps of 30,000 men which\r\nhe had requested Frederick William to provide, and said to Prince\r\nHatzfeld (January 29th): \"Your King is going to Breslau: I think it a\r\ntimely step.\" Such was Napoleon's frame of mind, even after he heard\r\nof Yorck's convention with the Russians. That event he considered \"the\r\nworst occurrence that could happen.\" Yet neither that nor the\r\npatriotic ferment in Prussia reft the veil from his eyes. He still\r\nbelieved that the Prussians would follow their King, and that the King\r\nwould obey him. On February the 3rd he wrote to Maret, complaining\r\nthat 2,000 Prussian horsemen were shutting themselves up in Silesian\r\ntowns, \"as if they were afraid of us, instead of helping us and\r\ncovering their country.\"\r\n\r\nOnce away from Berlin, Frederick William found himself launched on a\r\nresistless stream of national enthusiasm. At heart he was no less a\r\npatriot than the most ardent of the university students; but he knew\r\nfar better than they the awful risks of war with the French Empire.\r\nHis little kingdom of 4,700,000 souls, with but half-a-dozen\r\nstrongholds it could call its own, a realm ravaged by Napoleon's\r\ntroops alike in war and peace until commerce and credit were but a dim\r\nmemory--such a land could ill afford to defy an empire ten times as\r\npopulous and more than ten times as powerful. True, the Russians were\r\npouring in under the guise of friendship; but the bitter memories of\r\nTilsit forbade any implicit trust in Alexander. And, if the dross had\r\nbeen burnt out of his nature by a year of fiery trial, could his army,\r\nexhausted by that frightful winter campaign and decimated by the\r\ndiseases which Napoleon's ghastly array scattered broadcast in its\r\nflight, ever hope, even with the help of Prussia's young levies, to\r\ncope with the united forces of Napoleon and Austria?\r\n\r\nFor at present it seemed that the Court of Vienna would hold fast to\r\nthe French alliance. There Metternich was all-powerful, and the\r\nkeystone of his system was a guarded but profit-seeking subservience\r\nto Napoleon. Not that the Emperor Francis and he loved the French\r\npotentate; but they looked on him now as a pillar of order, as a\r\nbarrier against Jacobinism in France, against the ominous\r\npan-Germanism preached by Prussian enthusiasts, and against Muscovite\r\naggandizement in Turkey and Poland. Great was their concern, first at\r\nthe Russo-Turkish peace which installed the Muscovites at the northern\r\nmouth of the Danube, and still more at the conquering swoops of the\r\nRussian eagle on Warsaw and Posen. How could they now hope to gain\r\nfrom Turkey the set-off to the loss of Tyrol and Illyria on which they\r\nhad recently been counting, and how save any of the Polish lands from\r\nthe grip of Russia? For the present Russia was more to be feared than\r\nNapoleon. Her influence seemed the more threatening to the policy of\r\nbalance on which the fortunes of the Hapsburgs were delicately poised.\r\n\r\nOnly by degrees were these fears and jealousies laid to rest. It\r\nneeded all the address of a British envoy, Lord Walpole, who repaired\r\nsecretly to Vienna and held out the promise of tempting gains, to\r\nassuage these alarms, and turn Austria's gaze once more on her lost\r\nprovinces, Tyrol, Illyria, and Venetia. For the present, however,\r\nnothing came of these overtures; and when the French discovered\r\nWalpole's presence at Vienna, Metternich begged him to leave.[283]\r\n\r\nFor the present, then, Austria assumed a neutral attitude. A truce was\r\nconcluded with Russia, and a special envoy was sent to Paris to\r\nexplain the desire of the Emperor Francis to act as mediator, with a\r\nview to the conclusion of a general peace. The latest researches into\r\nAustrian policy show that the Kaiser desired an honourable peace for\r\nall parties concerned, and that Metternich may have shared his views.\r\nBut, early in the negotiations, Napoleon showed flashes of distrust as\r\nto the sincerity of his father-in-law, and Austria gradually changed\r\nher attitude. The change was to be fatal to Napoleon. But the question\r\nwhether it was brought about by Napoleon's obstinacy, or Metternich's\r\nperfidy, or the force of circumstances, must be postponed for the\r\npresent, while we consider events of equal importance and of greater\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nWhile Austria balanced and Frederick William negotiated, the sterner\r\nminds of North Germany rushed in on the once sacred ground of\r\ndiplomacy and statecraft. The struggle against Napoleon was prepared\r\nfor by the exile Stein, and war was first proclaimed by a professor.\r\n\r\nAmong the many influences that urged on the Czar to a war for the\r\nliberation of Prussia and Europe, not the least was that wielded at\r\nhis Court in the latter half of 1812 by the staunch German patriot,\r\nStein. His heroic spirit never quailed, even in the darkest hour of\r\nPrussia's humiliation; and he now pointed out convincingly that the\r\nonly sure means of overthrowing Napoleon was to raise Germany against\r\nhim. To remain on a tame defensive at Warsaw would be to court another\r\nFrench invasion in 1813. The safety of Russia called for a pursuit of\r\nthe French beyond the Elbe and a rally of the Germans against the man\r\nthey detested. The appeal struck home. It revived Alexander's longings\r\nfor the liberation of Europe, which he had buried at Tilsit; and it\r\nagreed with the promptings of an ambitious statecraft. Only by\r\noverthrowing Napoleon's supremacy in Germany could the Czar gain a\r\nfree hand for a lasting settlement of the Polish Question. The eastern\r\nturn given to his policy in 1807 was at an end--but not before Russia\r\nhad taken another step towards the Bosphorus. With one leg planted at\r\nthe mouth of the Danube, the Colossus now prepared to stride over\r\nCentral Europe. The aims of Catherine II. in 1792 were at last to be\r\nrealized. While Europe was wrestling with Revolutionary France, the\r\nMuscovite grasp was to tighten on Poland. It is not surprising that\r\nAlexander, on January 13th, commented on the \"brilliance of the\r\npresent situation,\" or that he decided to press onward. He gave little\r\nheed to the Gallophil counsels of Romantzoff or the dolorous warnings\r\nof the German-hating Kutusoff; and, on January 18th, he empowered\r\nStein provisionally to administer in his name the districts of Prussia\r\n(Proper) when occupied by Russian troops.\r\n\r\nSo irregular a proceeding could only be excused by dire necessity and\r\nby success. It was more than excused; it was triumphantly justified.\r\nFour days later Stein arrived at Königsberg, in company with the\r\npatriotic poet, Arndt. The Estates, or Provincial Assemblies, of East\r\nand West Prussia were summoned, and they heartily voted supplies for\r\nforming a Landwehr or militia, as well as a last line of defence\r\ncalled the Landsturm. This step, unique in the history of Prussia, was\r\ntaken apart from, almost in defiance of, the royal sanction: it was,\r\nin fact, due to the masterful will of Stein, who saw that a great\r\npopular impulse, and it alone, could overcome the inertia of King and\r\nofficials. That impulse he himself originated, and by virtue of powers\r\nconferred on him by the Emperor Alexander. And the ball thus set\r\nrolling at Königsberg was to gather mass and momentum until, thanks to\r\nthe powerful aid of Wellington in the South, it overthrew Napoleon at\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nThe action of the exile was furthered by the word of a thinker and\r\nseer. A worthy professor at the University of Breslau, named Steffens,\r\nhad long been meditating on some means of helping his country. The\r\narrival of Frederick William had kindled a flame of devotion which\r\nperplexed that modest and rather pedantic ruler. But he so far\r\nresponded to it as to allow Hardenberg to issue (February 3rd) an\r\nappeal for volunteers to \"reinforce the ranks of the old defenders of\r\nthe country.\" The appeal was entirely vague: it did not specify\r\nwhether they would serve against the nominal enemy, Russia, or the\r\nreal enemy, Napoleon. Pondering this weighty question, as did all good\r\npatriots, Steffens heard, in the watches of the night, the voice of\r\nconscience declare: \"Thou must declare war against Napoleon.\" At his\r\nearly morning lecture on Physics, which was very thinly attended, he\r\ntold the students that he would address them at eleven on the call for\r\nvolunteers. That lecture was thronged; and to the sea of eager faces\r\nSteffens spoke forth the thought that simmered in every brain, the\r\nburning desire for _war with Napoleon_. He offered himself as a\r\nrecruit: 200 students from Breslau and 258 from the University of\r\nBerlin soon flocked to the colours, and that, too, chiefly from the\r\nclasses which of yore had detested the army. Thanks to the teachings\r\nof Fichte and the still deeper lessons of adversity, the mind of\r\nGermany was now ranged on the side of national independence and\r\nagainst an omnivorous imperialism.\r\n\r\nWhere the mind led the body followed, yet still somewhat haltingly. In\r\ntruth, the King and his officials were in a difficult position. They\r\ndistrusted the Russians, who seemed chiefly eager to force Frederick\r\nWilliam into war with France and to arrange the question of a frontier\r\nafterwards. But the eastern frontier was a question of life and death\r\nfor Prussia. If Alexander kept the whole of the great Duchy of Warsaw,\r\nthe Hohenzollern States would be threatened from the east as\r\ngrievously as ever they were on the west by the French at Magdeburg.\r\nAnd the Czar seemed resolved to keep the whole of Poland. He told the\r\nPrussian envoy, Knesebeck, that, while handing over to Frederick\r\nWilliam the whole of Saxony, Russia must retain all the Polish lands,\r\na resolve which would have planted the Russian standards almost on the\r\nbanks of the Oder. Nay, more: Knesebeck detected among the Russian\r\nofficials a strong, though as yet but half expressed, longing for the\r\nwhole of Prussia east of the lower Vistula.\r\n\r\nFor his part, Frederick William cherished lofty hopes. He knew that\r\nthe Russian troops had suffered horribly from privations and disease,\r\nthat as yet they mustered only 40,000 effectives on the Polish\r\nborders, and that they urgently needed the help of Prussia. He\r\ntherefore claimed that, if he joined Russia in a war against Napoleon,\r\nhe must recover the whole of what had been Prussian Poland, with the\r\nexception of the district of Bialystock ceded at Tilsit.[284] It\r\nseemed, then, that the Polish Question would once more exert on the\r\nEuropean concert that dissolving influence which had weakened the\r\nCentral Powers ever since the days of Valmy. Had Napoleon now sent to\r\nBreslau a subtle schemer like Savary, the apple of discord might have\r\nbeen thrown in with fatal results. But the fortunes of his Empire then\r\nrested on a Piedmontese nobleman, St. Marsan, who showed a singular\r\ncredulity as to Prussia's subservience. He accepted all Hardenberg's\r\nexplanations (including a thin official reproof to Steffens), and did\r\nlittle or nothing to countermine the diplomatic approaches of Russia.\r\nThe ground being thus left clear, it was possible for the Czar to\r\nspeak straight to the heart of Frederick William. This he now did.\r\nKnesebeck was set aside; and Alexander, meeting the Prussian demands\r\nhalfway, promised in a treaty, signed at Kalisch on February 27th, to\r\nleave Prussia all her present territories, and to secure for her the\r\nequivalent, in a \"statistical, financial, and geographical sense,\" of\r\nthe lands which she had lost since 1806, along with a territory\r\nadapted to connect Prussia Proper with the province of Silesia.[285]\r\n\r\nIt seems certain that Stein's influence weighed much with Alexander in\r\nthis final compromise, which postponed the irritating question of the\r\neastern frontier and bent all the energies of two great States to the\r\nWar of Liberation. Stein was sent to Frederick William at Breslau; but\r\nthe King hardly deigned to see him, and the greatest of German\r\npatriots was suffered to remain in a garret of that city during a\r\nwearisome attack of fever. But he lived through disease and official\r\nneglect as he triumphed over Slavonic intrigues; and he had at hand\r\nthat salve of many an able man--the knowledge that, even while he\r\nhimself was slighted, his plans were adopted with beneficent and\r\nfar-reaching results.\r\n\r\nThe Russo-Prussian alliance was firmly upheld by Lord Cathcart, the\r\nBritish ambassador to Russia, who reached headquarters on March the\r\n2nd. For the present, Great Britain did not definitely join the\r\nallies; but the discussions on the Hanoverian Question, which had\r\npreviously sundered us from Prussia, soon proved that wisdom had been\r\nlearnt in the school of adversity. The Hohenzollerns now renounced all\r\nclaims to Hanover, though they showed some repugnance to our\r\nPrince-Regent's demand that the Electorate should receive some\r\nterritorial gain.\r\n\r\nThus the two questions on which Napoleon had counted as certain to\r\nclog the wheels of the Coalition, as they had done in the past, were\r\nremoved, and the way was cleared for a compact firmer than any which\r\nEurope had hitherto known. On March 17th a Russo-Prussian Convention\r\nwas concluded at Breslau whereby those Powers agreed to deliver\r\nGermany from France, to dissolve the Confederation of the Rhine, and\r\nto summon the German princes and people to help them; every prince\r\nthat refused would suffer the loss of his States; and arrangements\r\nwere made for the provisional administration of the lands which the\r\nallies should occupy. Frederick William also appealed to his people\r\nand to his army, and instituted that coveted order of merit, the Iron\r\nCross.\r\n\r\nBut there was small need of appeals and decorations. The people rushed\r\nto arms with an ardour that rivalled the _levée en masse_ of France in\r\n1793. Nobles and students, professors and peasants, poets and\r\nmerchants, shouldered their muskets. Housewives and maidens brought\r\ntheir scanty savings or their treasured trinkets as offerings for the\r\naltar of the Fatherland. One incident deserves special notice. A girl,\r\nNanny by name, whose ringlets were her only wealth, shore them off,\r\nsold them, and brought the price of them, two thalers, for the sacred\r\ncause. A noble impulse thrilled through Germany. Volunteers came from\r\nfar, many of whom were to ride with Lützow's irregular horse in his\r\nwild ventures. Most noteworthy of these was the gifted young poet,\r\nKorner, a Saxon by birth, who now forsook a life of ease, radiant with\r\npoetic promise, at the careless city of Vienna, to follow the Prussian\r\neagle. \"A great time calls for great hearts,\" he wrote to his father:\r\n\"am I to write vaudevilles when I feel within me the courage and\r\nstrength for joining the actors on the stage of real life?\" Alas! for\r\nhim the end was to be swift and tragic. Not long after inditing an ode\r\nto his sword, he fell in a skirmish near Hamburg.\r\n\r\nGermany mourned his loss; but she mourned still more that her greatest\r\npoet, Goethe, felt no throb of national enthusiasm. The great Olympian\r\nwas too much wrapped up in his lofty speculations to spare much\r\nsympathy for struggling mortals below: \"Shake your chains, if you\r\nwill: the man (Napoleon) is too strong for you: you will not break\r\nthem.\" Such was his unprophetic utterance at Dresden to the elder\r\nKorner. Men who touched the people's pulse had no such doubts. \"Ah!\r\nthose were noble times,\" wrote Arndt: \"the fresh young hope of life\r\nand honour sang in all hearts; it echoed along every street; it rolled\r\nmajestically down every chancel.\" The sight of Germans thronging from\r\nall parts into Silesia to fight for their Prussian champions awakened\r\nin him the vision of a United Germany, which took form in the song,\r\n\"What is the German's Fatherland?\"[286]\r\n\r\nAgainst this ever-rising tide of national enthusiasm Napoleon pitted\r\nthe resources which Gallic devotion still yielded up to his demands.\r\nThey were surprisingly great. In less than half a year, after the loss\r\nof half a million of men, a new army nearly as numerous was marshalled\r\nunder the imperial eagles. Thirty thousand tried troops were brought\r\nfrom Spain, thereby greatly relieving the pressure on Wellington.\r\nItaly and the garrison towns of the Empire sent forth a vast number.\r\nBut the majority were young, untrained troops; and it was remarked\r\nthat the conscripts born in the years of the Terror, 1793-4, had not\r\nthe stamina of the earlier levies. Brave they were, superbly brave;\r\nand the Emperor sought by every means to breathe into them his own\r\nindomitable spirit. One of them has described how, on handing them\r\ntheir colours, he made a brief speech; and, at the close, rising in\r\nhis stirrups and stretching forth his hand, he shot at them the\r\nquestion: \"'You swear to guard them?' I felt, as we all felt, that he\r\nsnatched from our very navel the cry, 'Yes, we swear.'\" Truly, the\r\nEmperor could make boys heroes, but he could never repair the losses\r\nof 1812. Guns he possessed to the number of a thousand in his\r\narsenals; but he lacked the thousands of skilled artillerymen: youths\r\nhe could find and horses he could buy: but not for many a month had he\r\nthe resistless streams of horsemen that poured over Prussia after\r\nJena, or swept into the Great Redoubt at Borodino. Nevertheless, the\r\nenergy which embattled a new host within five months of a seemingly\r\noverwhelming disaster, must be considered the most extraordinary event\r\nof an age fertile in marvels. \"The imagination sinks back confounded,\"\r\nsays Pasquier, \"when one thinks of all the work to be done and the\r\nresources of all kinds to be found, in order to raise, clothe, and\r\nequip such an army in so short a time.\"\r\n\r\nWhile immersed in this prodigious task, the Emperor heard, with some\r\nsurprise but with no dismay, the news of Prussia's armaments and\r\ndisaffection. At first he treats it as a passing freak which will\r\nvanish with firm treatment. \"Remain at Berlin as long as you can,\" he\r\nwrites to Eugène, March 5th. \"Make examples for the sake of\r\ndiscipline. At the least insult, whether from a village or a town,\r\nwere it from Berlin itself, burn it down.\" The chief thing that still\r\nconcerns him is the vagueness of Eugène's reports, which leave him no\r\noption but to get news about his troops in Germany from _the English\r\nnewspapers_. \"Do not forget,\" he writes again on March 14th, \"that\r\nPrussia has only four millions of people. She never in her most\r\nprosperous times had more than 150,000 troops. She will not have more\r\nthan 40,000 now.\" That, indeed, was the number to which he had limited\r\nher after Tilsit; and he was unable to conceive that Scharnhorst's\r\nplan of passing men into a reserve would send triple that force into\r\nthe field.[287] As for the Russians, he writes, they are thinned by\r\ndisease, and must spread out widely in order to besiege the many\r\nfortresses between the Vistula and the Elbe. Indeed, he assures his\r\nally, the King of Bavaria, that it will be good policy to let them\r\nadvance: \"The farther they advance, the more certain is their ruin.\"\r\nSixty thousand troops were being led by Bertrand from Italy into\r\nBavaria.[288] These, along with the corps of Eugène and Davoust, would\r\ncrush the Russian columns. And, while the allies were busy in Saxony,\r\nNapoleon proposed to mass a great force under the shelter of the Harz\r\nMountains, cross the Elbe near Havelberg, make a rush for the relief\r\nof Stettin, and stretch a hand to the large French force beleaguered\r\nat Danzig.\r\n\r\nSuch was his first plan. It was upset by the rapidity of the Cossacks\r\nand the general uprising of Prussia. Augereau's corps was driven from\r\nBerlin by a force of Cossacks led by Tettenborn; and this daring free\r\nlance, a native of Hamburg, thereupon made a dash for the liberation\r\nof his city. For the time he was completely successful: the fury of\r\nthe citizens against the French _douaniers_ gave the Cossacks and\r\npatriots an easy triumph there and throughout Hanover. This news\r\ncaused Napoleon grave concern. The loss of the great Hanse Town opened\r\na wide door for English goods, English money, and English troops into\r\nGermany. It must be closed at all costs: and, with severe rebukes to\r\nEugène and Lauriston, who were now holding the line of the middle\r\nElbe, he charged Davoust (March 18th) to hold the long winding course\r\nof that river between Magdeburg and Hamburg. The advance of this\r\ndetermined leader was soon to change the face of affairs in North\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nShortly before Napoleon left Paris for the seat of war, he received\r\nthe new Austrian ambassador, Prince Schwarzenberg (April 9th). With a\r\njocular courtesy that veiled the deepest irony, he complimented him on\r\nhaving waged _a fine campaign in_ 1812. Austria's present requests\r\nwere not reassuring. While professing the utmost regard for the\r\nwelfare of Napoleon, she renewed her offer of mediation in a more\r\npressing way. In fact, Metternich's aim now was to free Austria from\r\nthe threatening pressure of Napoleon on the west and of Russia on the\r\neast. She must now assure to Europe a lasting peace--\"not a mere truce\r\nin disguise, like all former treaties with Napoleon\"--but a peace that\r\nwould restrict the power of France and \"establish a balance of power\r\namong the chief States.\"[289] Such was the secret aim of Austria's\r\nmediation. Obviously, it gave her many advantages. While posing as\r\nmediator, she could claim her share in the territorial redistribution\r\nwhich must accompany the peace. The blessing awarded to the peacemaker\r\nmust be tangible and immediate.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's reply to the ambassador was carefully guarded. War was not\r\nto his interest. It would cost more blood than the Moscow campaign.\r\nThe great hindrance to any settlement would be England. Russia also\r\nseemed disposed to a fight _à outrance_; but if the Czar wanted peace,\r\nit was for him, not for France, to take the initiative: \"I cannot take\r\nthe initiative: that would be like capitulating as if I were in a\r\nfort: it is for the others to send me their proposals.\" And he\r\nexpressed his resolve to accept no disadvantageous terms in these\r\nnotable words: \"If I concluded a dishonourable peace, it would be my\r\noverthrow. I am a new man; I must pay the more heed to public opinion,\r\nbecause I stand in need of it. The French have lively imaginations:\r\nthey love fame and excitement, and are nervous. Do you know the prime\r\ncause of the fall of the Bourbons? It dates from Rossbach.\" Benevolent\r\nassurances as to Napoleon's desire for peace and for the assembly of a\r\nCongress were all that Schwarzenberg could gain; and his mission was\r\nbarren of result, except to increase suspicions on both sides.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Napoleon was playing his cards at Vienna. He had sent Count\r\nNarbonne thither on a special mission, the purport of which stands\r\nrevealed in the envoy's \"verbal note\" of April 7th. In that note\r\nAustria was pressed to help France with 100,000 men, against Russia\r\nand Prussia, in case they should open hostilities; her reward was to\r\nbe the rich province of Silesia. As for the rest of Prussia, two\r\nmillions of that people were to be assigned to Saxony, Frederick\r\nWilliam being thrust to the east of the lower Vistula, and left with\r\none million subjects.[290] Such was the glittering prize dangled\r\nbefore Metternich. But even the prospect of regaining the province\r\ntorn away by the great Frederick moved him not. He judged the\r\nestablishment of equilibrium in Europe to be preferable to a mean\r\ntriumph over Prussia. To her and to the Czar he had secretly held out\r\nhopes of succour in case Napoleon should prove intractable: and to\r\nthis course of action he still clung. True, he trampled on _la petite\r\nmorale_ in neglecting to aid his nominal ally, Napoleon. But to\r\nabandon him, if he remained obdurate, was, after all, but an act of\r\ntreachery to an individual who had slight claims on Austria, and whose\r\npresent offer was alike immoral and insulting. Four days later\r\nMetternich notified to Russia and Prussia that the Emperor Francis\r\nwould now proceed with his task of armed mediation.[291]\r\n\r\nAustria's overtures for a general peace met with no encouragement at\r\nLondon. Her envoy, Count Wessenberg, was now treated with the same\r\ncold reserve that had been accorded to Lord Walpole at Vienna early in\r\nthe year. On April 9th Castlereagh informed him that all hope of peace\r\nhad failed since the \"Ruler of France\" had declared to the Legislative\r\nBody that _the French Dynasty reigned and would continue to reign in\r\nSpain, and that he had already stated all the sacrifices that he could\r\nconsent to make for peace_.\r\n\r\n    \"Whilst he [Napoleon] shall continue to declare that none of the\r\n    territories arbitrarily incorporated into the French Empire shall\r\n    become matter of negotiation, it is in vain to hope that His\r\n    Imperial Majesty's beneficent intentions can by negotiation be\r\n    accomplished. It is for His Imperial Majesty to consider, after a\r\n    declaration in the nature of a defiance from the Ruler of France,\r\n    a declaration highly insulting to His Imperial Majesty when his\r\n    intervention for peace had been previously accepted, whether the\r\n    moment is not arrived for all the Great Powers of Europe to act in\r\n    concert for their common interests and honour. To obtain for their\r\n    States what may deserve the name of peace they must look again to\r\n    establish an Equilibrium in Europe.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, the British Government refused to lend itself to a\r\nnegotiation which must weaken and distract the efforts of Russia and\r\nPrussia.[292]\r\n\r\nFor the present Napoleon indulged the hope that the bribe of Silesia\r\nwould range Austria's legions side by side with his own, and with\r\nPoniatowski's Poles. Animated with this hope, he left Paris before the\r\ndawn of April 15th; and, travelling at furious speed, his carriage\r\nrolled within the portals of Mainz in less than forty hours. There he\r\nstayed for a week, feeling every throb of the chief arteries of his\r\nadvance. They beat full and fast; the only bad symptom was the refusal\r\nof Saxony to place her cavalry at his disposal. But, at the close of\r\nthe week, Austria's attitude gave him concern. It was clear that she\r\nhad not swallowed the bait of Silesia, and that her troops could not\r\nbe counted on.\r\n\r\nAt once he takes precautions. His troops in Italy are to be made\r\nready, the strongholds of the Upper Danube strengthened, and his\r\nGerman vassals are closely to watch the policy of Vienna.[293] He then\r\nproceeds to Weimar. There, on April 29th, he mounts his war-horse and\r\ngazes with searching eyes into the columns that are winding through\r\nthe Thuringian vales towards Leipzig. The auguries seem favourable.\r\nThe men are full of ardour: the line of march is itself an\r\ninspiration; and the veterans cheer the young conscripts with tales of\r\nthe great day of Jena and Auerstädt.\r\n\r\nAt the close of April the military situation was as follows. Eugène\r\nBeauharnais, who commanded the relics of the Grand Army, after\r\nsuffering a reverse at Mockern, had retired to the line of the Elbe;\r\nand French garrisons were thus left isolated in Danzig, Modlin,\r\nZamosc, Glogau, Küstrin, and Stettin.[294] Napoleon's first plan of an\r\nadvance direct to Stettin and Danzig having miscarried, he now sought\r\nto gather an immense force as secretly as possible near the Main,\r\nspeedily to reinforce Eugène, crush the heads of the enemy's columns,\r\nand, rolling them up in disorder, carry the war to the banks of the\r\nOder, and relieve his beleaguered garrisons by way of Leipzig and\r\nTorgau. The plan would have the further advantage of bringing a\r\nformidable force near to the Austrian frontier, and holding fast the\r\nHapsburgs and Saxons to the French alliance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the allied army was pressing westwards with no less\r\ndetermination. The Czar and King had addressed a menacing summons to\r\nthe King of Saxony to join them, but, receiving no response, invaded\r\nhis States. Thereupon Frederick Augustus fled into Bohemia, relying on\r\nan offer from Vienna which guaranteed him his German lands if he would\r\njoin the Hapsburgs in their armed mediation.[295] For the present,\r\nhowever, Saxony was to be the battlefield of the two contending\r\nprinciples of nationality and Napoleonic Imperialism.\r\n\r\nThey clashed together on the historic ground of Lützen. Not only the\r\nassociations of the place, but the reputation of the leaders helped to\r\nkindle the enthusiasm of the rank and file. On the one side was the\r\ngreat conqueror himself, with faculties and prestige undimmed even by\r\nthe greatest disaster recorded in the annals of civilized nations. He\r\nwas opposed by men no less determined than himself. The illness and\r\nfinally the death of the obstinate old Kutusoff had stopped the\r\nintrigues of the Slav peace party, hitherto strong in the Russian\r\ncamp: and the command now devolved on Wittgenstein, a more energetic\r\nman, whose heart was in his work.\r\n\r\nBut the most inspiring influence was that of Blücher. The staunch\r\npatriot seemed to embody the best qualities of the old _régime_ and of\r\nthe new era. The rigour learnt in the school of Frederick the Great\r\nwas vivified by the fresh young enthusiasm of the dawning age of\r\nnationality. Not that the old soldier could appreciate the lofty\r\nteachings of Fichte the philosopher and Schleiermacher the preacher.\r\nBut his lack of learning--he could never write a despatch without\r\nstrange torturings of his mother-tongue--was more than made up by a\r\nquenchless love of the Fatherland, by a robust common sense, which hit\r\nstraight at the mark where subtler minds strayed off into side issues,\r\nby a comradeship that endeared him to every private, and by a courage\r\nthat never quailed. And all these gifts, homely but invaluable in a\r\npeople's war, were wrought to utmost tension by an all-absorbing\r\npassion, hatred of Napoleon. In the dark days after Jena, when,\r\npressed back to the Baltic, his brave followers succumbed to the\r\nweight of numbers, he began to store up vials of fury against the\r\ninsolent conqueror. Often he beguiled the weary hours with lunging at\r\nan imaginary foe, calling out--_Napoleon_. And this almost Satanic\r\nhatred bore the old man through seven years of humiliation; it gave\r\nhim at seventy-two years of age the energy of youth; far from being\r\nsated by triumphs in Saxony and Champagne, it nerved him with new\r\nstrength after the shocks to mind and body which he sustained at\r\nLigny; it carried him and his army through the miry lanes of Wavre on\r\nto the sunset radiance of Waterloo.\r\n\r\nWhat he lacked in skill and science was made up by his able\r\ncoadjutors, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, the former pre-eminent in\r\norganization, the latter in strategy. After organizing Prussia's\r\ncitizen army, it was Scharnhorst's fate to be mortally wounded in the\r\nfirst battle; but his place, as chief of staff, was soon filled by\r\nGneisenau, in whose nature the sternness of the warrior was happily\r\nblended with the coolness of the scientific thinker. The accord\r\nbetween him and Blücher was close and cordial; and the latter, on\r\nreceiving the degree of doctor of laws from the University of Oxford,\r\nwittily acknowledged his debt to the strategist. \"Well,\" said he, \"if\r\nI am to be a doctor, they must make Gneisenau an apothecary; for he\r\nmakes up the pills and I then administer them.\"\r\n\r\nOn these resolute chiefs and their 33,000 Prussians fell the brunt of\r\nthe fighting near Lützen. Wittgenstein, with his 35,000 Russians,\r\nshowed less energy; but if a fourth Russian corps under Miloradovitch,\r\nthen on the Elster, had arrived in time, the day might have closed\r\nwith victory for the allies. Their plan was to cross a stream, called\r\nthe Floss Graben, some five miles to the south of Lützen, storm the\r\nvillages of Gross Görschen, Rahna, and Starsiedel, held by the French\r\nvanguard, and, cutting into Napoleon's line of march towards Lützen\r\nand Leipzig, throw it into disorder and rout. But their great enemy\r\nhad recently joined his array to that of Eugène: he was in force, and\r\nwas then planning a turning movement on the north, similar to that\r\nwhich threatened his south flank. Ney, on whom fell Blücher's first\r\nblows, had observed the preparations, and one of his divisions, that\r\nof Souham, had strengthened the village of Gross Görschen for an\r\nobstinate defence. The French position is thus described by Lord\r\nCathcart, who was then present at the allied headquarters:\r\n\r\n    \"The country is uncovered and open, but with much variety of hill\r\n    and valley, and much intersected by hollow ways and millstreams,\r\n    the former not discernible till closely approached. The enemy,\r\n    placed behind a long ridge and in a string of villages, with a\r\n    hollow way in front, and a stream sufficient to float timber on\r\n    the left, waited the near approach of the allies. He had an\r\n    immense quantity of ordnance: the batteries in the open country\r\n    were supported by masses of infantry in solid squares. The plan of\r\n    our operations was to attack Gross Görschen with artillery and\r\n    infantry, and meanwhile to pierce the line, to the enemy's right\r\n    of the villages, with a strong column of cavalry in order to cut\r\n    off the troops in the villages from support.... The cavalry of the\r\n    Prussian Reserve, to whose lot this attack fell, made it with\r\n    great gallantry; but the showers of grapeshot and musketry to\r\n    which they were exposed in reaching the hollow way made it\r\n    impracticable for them to penetrate; and, the enemy appearing\r\n    determined to hold the villages at any expense, the affair assumed\r\n    the most expensive character of attack and defence of a post\r\n    repeatedly taken, lost, and retaken. The cavalry made several\r\n    attempts to break the enemy's line, and in some of their attacks\r\n    succeeded in breaking into the squares and cutting down the\r\n    infantry. Late in the evening, Bonaparte, having called in the\r\n    troops from [the side of] Leipzig and collected all his reserves,\r\n    made an attack on the right of the allies, supported by the fire\r\n    of several batteries advancing. The vivacity of this movement made\r\n    it expedient to change the front of our nearest brigades on our\r\n    right; and, as the whole cavalry from our left was ordered to the\r\n    right to turn this attack, I was not without hopes of witnessing\r\n    the destruction of Bonaparte and of all his army; but before the\r\n    cavalry could arrive, it became so dark that nothing could be seen\r\n    but the flashes of the guns.\"[296]\r\n\r\nThe desperate fight thus closed with a slight advantage to the French,\r\ndue to the timely advance of Eugène with Macdonald's corps against the\r\nright flank of the wearied allies, when it was too late for them to\r\nmake any counter-move. These had lost severely, and among the fallen\r\nwas Scharnhorst, whose wound proved to be mortal. But Blücher, far\r\nfrom being daunted by defeat or by a wound, led seven squadrons of\r\nhorse against the victors after nightfall, threw them for a brief\r\nspace into a panic, and nearly charged up to the square which\r\nsheltered Napoleon. The Saxon Captain von Odeleben, who was at the\r\nFrench headquarters, states that the Emperor was for a few minutes\r\nquite dazed by the daring of this stroke; and he now had too few\r\nsquadrons to venture on any retaliation. Both sides were, in fact,\r\nexhausted. The allies had lost 10,000 men killed and wounded, but no\r\nprisoners or guns: the French losses were nearly as heavy, and five\r\nguns and 800 prisoners fell into Blücher's hands. Both armies camped\r\non the field of battle; but, as the supplies of ammunition of the\r\nallies had run low, and news came to hand that Lauriston had dislodged\r\nKleist from Leipzig, it was decided to retreat towards Dresden.\r\n\r\nNapoleon cautiously followed them, leaving behind Ney's corps, which\r\nhad suffered frightfully at Gross Görschen; and he strove to inspirit\r\nthe conscripts, many of whom had shown unsteadiness, by proclaiming to\r\nthe army that the victory of Lützen would rank above Austerlitz, Jena,\r\nFriedland, and Borodino.\r\n\r\nFar from showing dejection, Alexander renewed to Cathcart his\r\nassurance of persevering in the war. At Dresden our envoy was again\r\nassured (May 7th) that the allies would not give in, but that \"Austria\r\nwill wear the cloak of mediation till the time her immense force is\r\nready to act, the 24th instant. Count Stadion is hourly expected here:\r\nhe will bring proposals of terms of peace and similar ones will be\r\nsent to the French headquarters. Receiving and refusing these\r\nproposals will occupy most of the time.\" In fact, Metternich was on\r\nthe point of despatching from Vienna two envoys, Stadion to the\r\nallies, Count Bubna to Napoleon, with the offer of Austria's armed\r\nmediation.\r\n\r\nIt found him in no complaisant mood. He had entered Dresden as a\r\nconqueror: he had bitterly chidden the citizens for their support of\r\nthe Prussian volunteers, and ordered them to beg their own King to\r\nreturn from Bohemia. To that hapless monarch he had sent an imperious\r\nmandate to come back and order the Saxon troops, who obstinately held\r\nTorgau, forthwith to hand it over to the French. On all sides his\r\nbehests were obeyed, the Saxon troops grudgingly ranging themselves\r\nunder the French eagles. And while he was tearing Saxony away from the\r\nnational cause, he was summoned by Austria to halt. The victor met the\r\nrequest with a flash of defiance. After a reproachful talk with Bubna,\r\non May 17th, he wrote two letters to the Emperor Francis. In the more\r\nofficial note he assured him that he desired peace, and that he\r\nassented to the opening of a Congress with that aim in view, in which\r\nEngland, Russia, Prussia, and even the Spanish insurgents might take\r\npart. He therefore proposed that an armistice should be concluded for\r\nthe needful preparations. But in the other letter he assured his\r\nfather-in-law that he was ready to die at the head of all the generous\r\nmen of France rather than become the sport of England. His resentment\r\nagainst Austria finds utterance in his despatch of the same day, in\r\nwhich he bids Caulaincourt seek an interview at once with the Czar:\r\n\"The essential thing is to have a talk with him.... My intention is to\r\nbuild him a golden bridge so as to deliver him from the intrigues of\r\nMetternich. If I must make sacrifices, I prefer to make them to a\r\nstraightforward enemy, rather than to the profit of Austria, which\r\nPower has betrayed my alliance, and, under the guise of mediator,\r\nmeans to claim the right of arranging everything.\" Caulaincourt is to\r\nremind Alexander how badly Austria behaved to him in 1812, and to\r\nsuggest that if he treats at once before losing another battle, he can\r\nretire with honour and _with good terms for Prussia, without any\r\nintervention from Austria_.\r\n\r\nHis other letters of this time show that it is on the Hapsburgs that\r\nhis resentment will most heavily fall. Eugène, who had recently\r\ndeparted to organize the forces in Italy, is urged to threaten Austria\r\nwith not fewer than 80,000 men, and to give out that he will soon have\r\n150,000 men under arms. And, while straining every nerve in Germany,\r\nFrance, and Italy, Napoleon asserts that there will be an armistice\r\nfor the conclusion of a general peace.[297] But the allies were not to\r\nbe duped into a peace that was no peace. They had good grounds for\r\nexpecting the eventual aid of Austria; and when Caulaincourt craved an\r\ninterview, the Czar refused his request, thus bringing affairs once\r\nmore to the arbitrament of the sword. The only effect of\r\nCaulaincourt's mission, and of Napoleon's bitter words to Bubna, was\r\nto alarm Austria.\r\n\r\nOn their side, the allies desired to risk no further check; and they\r\nhad therefore taken up a strong position near Bautzen, where they\r\ncould receive reinforcements and effectually cover Silesia. Their\r\nextreme left rested on the spurs of the Lusatian mountains, while\r\ntheir long front of some four miles in extent stretched northwards\r\nalong a ridge that rose between the River Spree and an affluent, and\r\nbent a convex threatening brow against that river and town. There they\r\nwere joined by Barclay, whose arrival brought their total strength to\r\n82,000 men. But again Napoleon had the advantage in numbers. Suddenly\r\ncalling in Ney's and Lauriston's force of 60,000 men, which had been\r\nsent north so as to threaten Berlin, he confronted the allies with at\r\nleast 130,000 men.[298]\r\n\r\nOn the first day of fighting (May 20th) the French seized the town of\r\nBautzen, but failed to drive the allies from the hilly, wooded ground\r\non the south. The fighting on the next day was far more serious. At\r\ndawn of a beautiful spring morning, in a country radiant with verdure\r\nand diversified by trim villages, the thunder of cannon and the\r\nsputter of skirmishers' lines presaged a stubborn conflict. The allied\r\nsovereigns from the commanding ridge at their centre could survey all\r\nthe enemy's movements on the hills opposite; and our commissary,\r\nColonel (afterwards Sir Hudson) Lowe, has thus described his view of\r\nNapoleon, who was near the French centre:\r\n\r\n    \"He was about fifty paces in front of the others, accompanied by\r\n    one of his marshals, with whom he walked backwards and forwards\r\n    for nearly an hour. He was dressed in a plain uniform coat and a\r\n    star [_sic_], with a plain hat, different from that of his\r\n    marshals and generals, which was feathered. In the rear, and to\r\n    the left of the ridge on which he stood, were his reserves. They\r\n    were formed in lines of squadrons and battalions, appearing like a\r\n    large column of battalions: their number must have been between\r\n    15,000 and 20,000.\r\n\r\n    After he had retired from the eminence, several of the battalions\r\n    were observed to be drawn off to his left, and to be replaced by\r\n    others from the rear: the masses of his reserves appeared to\r\n    suffer scarcely any diminution.... Those troops which were to act\r\n    against our right continued their march: the others, opposite our\r\n    centre, planted themselves about midway on the slope, which\r\n    descended from the ridge towards our position; and, under the\r\n    protection of the guns that crowned the ridge, they appeared to\r\n    set our cavalry at defiance.... Yet there was no forward movement\r\n    in that part. To turn and overthrow our flanks, particularly the\r\n    right one, appeared now to be their main object.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the case. Napoleon was employing his usual tactics of\r\nassailing the allies everywhere by artillery and musketry fire, so as\r\nto keep them in their already very extended position until he could\r\ndeliver a decisive blow. This was dealt, though somewhat tardily, by\r\nNey with his huge corps at the allied right, where Barclay's 5,000\r\nRussians were outmatched and driven back. The village of Preititz was\r\nlost, and with it the allies' communications were laid bare. It was of\r\nthe utmost importance to recover the village; and Blücher, at the\r\nright centre, hard pressed though he was, sent down Kleist's brigade,\r\nwhich helped to wrench the prize from that Marshal's grasp. But Ney\r\nwas too strong to be kept off, even by the streams of cannon-shot\r\npoured upon his dense columns. With the help of Lauriston's corps, he\r\nagain slowly pressed on, began to envelop the allies' right, and\r\nthreatened to cut off their retreat. Blücher was also furiously\r\nassailed by Marmont and Bertrand. On the left, it is true, the\r\nRussians had beaten back Oudinot with heavy loss; but, as Napoleon had\r\nnot yet seriously drawn on his reserves, the allied chiefs decided to\r\ndraw off their hard-pressed troops from this unequal contest, where\r\nvictory was impossible and delay might place everything in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nThe retirement began late in the afternoon. Covered by the fire of a\r\npowerful artillery from successive crests, and by the charges of their\r\ndauntless cavalry, the allies beat off every effort of the French to\r\nturn the retreat into a rout. In vain did Napoleon press the pursuit.\r\nAs at Lützen, he had cause to mourn the loss in the plains of Russia\r\nof those living waves that had swept his enemies from many a\r\nbattlefield. But now their columns refused to melt away. They filed\r\noff, unbroken and defiant, under the covering wings of Uhlans and\r\nCossacks.[299]\r\n\r\nThe next day witnessed the same sight, the allies drawing steadily\r\nback, showering shot from every post of vantage, and leaving not a\r\nprisoner or a caisson in the conquerors' hands. \"What!\" said Napoleon,\r\n\"after such a butchery, no results? no prisoners?\" Scarcely had he\r\nspoken these words, when a cannon-ball tore through his staff, killing\r\none general outright, wounding another, and shattering the frame of\r\nDuroc, Duc de Friuli. Napoleon was deeply affected by this occurrence.\r\nHe dismounted, went into the cottage where Duroc was taken, and for\r\nsome time pressed his hand in silence. Then he uttered the words:\r\n\"Duroc, there is another world where we shall meet again.\" To which\r\nthe Grand Marshal made reply: \"Yes, sire; but it will be in thirty\r\nyears, when you have triumphed over your enemies and realized all the\r\nhopes of your country.\" After a long pause of painful silence, the\r\nEmperor mournfully left the man for whom he felt, perhaps, the\r\nliveliest sympathy and affection he ever bestowed. Under Duroc's cold,\r\nreserved exterior the Emperor knew that there beat a true heart,\r\ndevoted and loyal ever since they had first met at Toulon. He received\r\nno one else for the rest of that night, and a hush of awe fell on the\r\ncamp at the unwonted signs of grief of their great leader.\r\n\r\nPossibly this loss strengthened the Emperor's desire for a truce, a\r\nfeeling not lessened by a mishap befalling one of his divisions, which\r\nfell into an ambush laid by the Prussians at Hainau, and lost 1,500\r\nmen and 18 guns.\r\n\r\nFor their part, the allies equally desired a suspension of arms. Their\r\nforces were in much confusion. Alexander had superseded Wittgenstein\r\nby Barclay, who now insisted on withdrawing the Russians into Poland.\r\nTo this the Prussian staff offered the most strenuous resistance. Such\r\na confession of weakness, urged Müffling, would dishearten the troops\r\nand intimidate the Austrian statesmen who had promised speedy succour.\r\nLet the allies cling to the sheltering rampart of the Riesengebirge,\r\nwhere they might defy Napoleon's attacks and await the white-coats.\r\nThe fortress of Schweidnitz would screen their retreat, and the\r\nLandwehr of Silesia would make good the gaps in their ranks. Towards\r\nSchweidnitz, then, the Czar ordered Barclay to retreat.\r\n\r\nThere two disappointments awaited them. The fortifications, dismantled\r\nby the French in 1807, were still in disrepair, and the 20,000 muskets\r\nbought in Austria for the Silesian levies were without touch-holes!\r\nAgain Barclay declared that he must retreat into Poland, and only the\r\noffer of a truce by Napoleon deterred him from that step, which must\r\nhave compromised the whole military and political situation. What\r\nwould not Napoleon have given to know the actual state of things at\r\nthe allied headquarters?[300] But no spy warned him of the truth; and\r\nas his own instincts prompted him to turn aside, so as to prepare\r\ncondign chastisement for Austria, he continued to treat for an\r\narmistice.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" he wrote to Eugène on June 2nd, \"can be more perfidious\r\nthan that Court. If I granted her present demands, she would\r\nafterwards ask for Italy and Germany. Certainly she shall have nothing\r\nfrom me.\" Events served to strengthen his resolve. The French entered\r\nBreslau in triumph, and raised the siege of Glogau. The coalition\r\nseemed to be tottering. That the punishment dealt to the allies and\r\nAustria might be severe and final, he only needed a few weeks for the\r\nreorganization of his once formidable cavalry. Then he could vent his\r\nrage upon Austria. Then he could overthrow the Hungarian horse, and\r\ncrumple up the ill-trained Austrian foot. A short truce, he believed,\r\nwas useless: it would favour the allies more than the French. And,\r\nunder the specious plea that the discussion of a satisfactory peace\r\nmust take up at least forty days, he ordered his envoy, Caulaincourt,\r\nto insist on a space of time which would admit of the French forces\r\nbeing fully equipped in Saxony, Bavaria, and Illyria. \"If,\" he wrote\r\nto Caulaincourt on June 4th, \"we did not wish to treat with a view to\r\npeace, we should not be so stupid as to treat for an armistice at the\r\npresent time.\" And he urged him to insist on the limit of July 20th,\r\n\"always on the same reasoning, namely, that we must have forty full\r\ndays to see if we can come to an understanding.\" Far different was his\r\nsecret warning to General Clarke, the Minister of War. To him he wrote\r\non June 2nd:\r\n\r\n    \"If I can, I will wait for the month of September to deal great\r\n    blows. I wish then to be in a position to crush my enemies, though\r\n    it is possible that, when Austria sees me about to do so, she may\r\n    make use of her pathetic and sentimental style, in order to\r\n    recognize the chimerical and ridiculous nature of her pretensions.\r\n    I have wished to write you this letter so that you may thoroughly\r\n    know my thoughts once for all.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to Maret, his Minister for Foreign Affairs, he wrote on the same\r\nday:\r\n\r\n    \"We must gain time, and to gain time without displeasing Austria,\r\n    we must use the same language we have used for the last six\r\n    months--that we can do everything if Austria is our ally.... Work\r\n    on this, beat about the bush, and gain time.... You can embroider\r\n    on this canvas for the next two months, and find matter for\r\n    sending twenty couriers.\"[301]\r\n\r\nIn such cases, where Napoleon's diplomatic assurances are belied by\r\nhis secret military instructions, no one who has carefully studied his\r\ncareer can doubt which course would be adopted. The armistice was\r\nmerely the pause that would be followed by a fiercer onset, unless the\r\nallies and Austria bent before his will. Of this they gave no sign\r\neven after the blow of Bautzen. In the negotiations concerning the\r\narmistice they showed no timidity; and when, on June 4th, it was\r\nsigned at Poischwitz up to July 20th, Napoleon felt some doubts\r\nwhether he had not shown too much complaisance.\r\n\r\nIt was so: in granting a suspension of arms he had signed his own\r\ndeath warrant.\r\n\r\nThe news that reached him at Dresden in the month of June helped to\r\nstiffen his resolve once more. Davoust and Vandamme had succeeded in\r\ndispersing the raw levies of North Germany and in restoring Napoleon's\r\nauthority at the mouths of the Elbe and Weser; and in this they now\r\nhad the help of the Danes.\r\n\r\nFor some time the allies had been seeking to win over Denmark. But\r\nthere was one insurmountable barrier in the way, the ambition of\r\nBernadotte. As we have seen, he was desirous of signalizing his\r\nprospective succession to the Swedish throne by bringing to his\r\nadopted country a land that would amply recompense it for the loss of\r\nFinland.[302] This could only be found in Norway, then united with\r\nDenmark; and this was the price of Swedish succour, to which the Czar\r\nhad assented during the war of 1812. For reasons which need not be\r\ndetailed here, Swedish help was not then forthcoming. But early in\r\n1813 it was seen that a diversion caused by the landing of 30,000\r\nSwedes in North Germany might be most valuable, and it was especially\r\ndesired by the British Government. Still, England was loth to gain the\r\nalliance of Bernadotte at the price of Norway, which must drive\r\nDenmark into the arms of France. Castlereagh, therefore, sought to\r\ntempt him by the offer of our recent conquest of Guadeloupe. Or, if he\r\nmust have Norway, would not Denmark give her assent if she received\r\nSwedish Pomerania and Lübeck? Bernadotte himself once suggested that\r\nhe would be satisfied with the Bishopric of Trondjem, the northern\r\npart of Norway, if he could gain no compensation for Denmark in\r\nGermany.[303]\r\n\r\nThis offer was tentatively made. It was all one. Denmark would not\r\nhear of the cession of Norway or any part of it; and in the course of\r\nthe negotiations with England she even put in a claim to the Hanse\r\nTowns, which was at once rejected. As Denmark was obdurate, Bernadotte\r\ninsisted that Sweden should gain the whole of Norway as the price of\r\nher help to the allies. By the treaty of Stockholm (March 3rd, 1813)\r\nwe acceded to the Russo-Swedish compact of the previous year, which\r\nassigned Norway to Sweden: we also promised to cede Guadeloupe to\r\nBernadotte, and to pay £1,000,000 towards the support of the Swedish\r\ntroops serving against Napoleon.[304] In the middle of May it was\r\nknown at Copenhagen that nothing was to be hoped for from Russia and\r\nEngland. The Danes, therefore, ranged themselves on the French side,\r\nwith results that were to prove fatal to the welfare of their kingdom.\r\n\r\nThus the bargain which Bernadotte drove with the allies leagued\r\nDenmark against them, and thereby hindered the liberation of North\r\nGermany. But, such is the irony of fate, the transfer of Norway from\r\nDenmark to Sweden has had a permanence in which Napoleon's territorial\r\narrangements have been signally lacking.\r\n\r\nBernadotte landed at Stralsund with 24,000 men, on May 18th. But the\r\norganization of his troops for the campaign was so slow that he could\r\nsend no effective help to the Cossacks and patriots at Hamburg. His\r\nseeming lethargy at once aroused the Czar's suspicions. This the\r\nSwedish Prince Royal speedily detected; and, on hearing of the\r\narmistice, he feared that another Tilsit would be the result. In a\r\npassionate letter, of June 10th, he begged Alexander not to accept\r\npeace: \"To accept a peace dictated by Napoleon is to rear a sepulchre\r\nfor Europe: and if this misfortune happens, only England and Sweden\r\ncan remain intact.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the real Bernadotte. Those who called him a disguised friend\r\nof Napoleon little knew the depth of his hatred for the Emperor, a\r\nhatred which was even then compassing the earth for means of\r\noverthrowing him, and saw in the person of a lonely French exile\r\nbeyond the Atlantic an instrument of vengeance. Already he had bidden\r\nhis old comrade in arms, Moreau, to come over and direct the people's\r\nwar against the tyrant who had exiled him; and the victor of\r\nHohenlinden was soon to land at Stralsund and spend his last days in\r\nserving against the tricolour.\r\n\r\nFor the present the prospects of the allies seemed gloomy indeed. In\r\nthe south-east they had lost all the land up to Breslau and Glogau;\r\nand in North Germany Davoust began to turn Hamburg into a great\r\nfortress. This was in obedience to Napoleon's orders. \"I shall never\r\nfeel assured,\" the Emperor wrote to his Marshal, \"until Hamburg can be\r\nlooked on as a stronghold provisioned for several months and prepared\r\nin every way for a long defence.\"--The ruin of commercial interests\r\nwas nought to him; and when Savary ventured to hint at the discontent\r\ncaused in French mercantile circles by these steps, he received a\r\nsharp rebuke: \"... The cackling of the Paris bankers matters very\r\nlittle to me. I am having Hamburg fortified. I am having a naval\r\narsenal formed there. Within a few months it will be one of my\r\nstrongest fortresses. I intend to keep a standing army of 15,000 men\r\nthere.\"[305] His plan was ruthlessly carried out. The wealth of\r\nHamburg was systematically extorted in order to furnish means for a\r\ncompleter subjection. Boundless exactions, robbery of the bank, odious\r\noppression of all classes, these were the first steps. Twenty thousand\r\npersons were thereafter driven out, first the young and strong as\r\nbeing dangerous, then the old and weak as being useless; and a once\r\nprosperous emporium of trade became Napoleon's chief northern\r\nstronghold, a centre of hope for French and Danes, and a stimulus to\r\nrevenge for every patriotic Teuton.[306]\r\n\r\nYet the patriots were not cast down by recent events. Their one desire\r\nwas for the renewal of war: their one fear was that the diplomatists\r\nwould once more barter away German independence. \"Our people,\" cried\r\nKarl Müller, \"is still too lazy because it is too wealthy. Let us\r\nlearn, as the Russians did, to go round and burn, and then find\r\nourselves dagger and poison, as the Spaniards did. Against those two\r\npeoples Napoleon's troops could effect nothing.\" And while gloom and\r\ndoubt hung over Germany, a cheering ray shot forth once more from the\r\nsouth-west. At the close of June came the news that Wellington had\r\nutterly routed the French at Vittoria.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nVITTORIA AND THE ARMISTICE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be beyond the scope of this work to describe in detail the\r\ncampaign that culminated at Vittoria. Our task must be limited to\r\nshowing what was the position of affairs at the close of 1812, what\r\nwere the Emperor's plans for holding part, at least, of Spain, and why\r\nthey ended in utter failure.\r\n\r\nThe causes, which had all along weakened the French operations in\r\nSpain, operated in full force during the campaign of 1812. The\r\njealousy of the Marshals, and, still more, their insubordination to\r\nKing Joseph, prevented that timely concentration of force by which the\r\nEmperor won his greatest triumphs. Discordant aims and grudging\r\nco-operation marked their operations. Military writers have often been\r\npuzzled to account for the rash moves of Marmont, which brought on him\r\nthe crushing blow of Salamanca. Had he waited but a few days before\r\npressing Wellington hard, he would have been reinforced by King Joseph\r\nwith 14,000 men.[307] But he preferred to risk all on a last dashing\r\nmove rather than to wait for the King and contribute, as second in\r\ncommand, to securing a substantial success.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence of Joseph before and after Salamanca is\r\ninstructive. We see him unable to move quickly to the support of\r\nMarmont, because the French Army of the North neglects to send him the\r\ndetachment needed for the defence of Madrid; and when, on hearing the\r\nnews of Salamanca, he orders Soult to evacuate Andalusia so as to\r\nconcentrate forces for the recovery of the capital, his command is for\r\nsome time disobeyed. When, at last, Joseph, Soult, and Suchet\r\nconcentrate their forces for a march on Madrid, Wellington is\r\ncompelled to retire. Pushing on his rear with superior forces, Joseph\r\nthen seeks to press on a battle; but again Soult moves so slowly that\r\nWellington is able to draw off his men and make good his retreat to\r\nCiudad Rodrigo.[308]\r\n\r\nApparently Joseph came off victor from the campaign of 1812; but the\r\nwithdrawal of French troops towards Madrid and the valley of the Douro\r\nhad fatal consequences. The south was at once lost to the French; and\r\nthe sturdy mountaineers of Biscay, Navarre, and Arragon formed large\r\nbands whose persistent daring showed that the north was far from\r\nconquered. Encouraged by the presence of a small British force, they\r\nseized on most of the northern ports; and their chief, Mina, was able\r\nto meet the French northern army on almost equal terms. In the east,\r\nSuchet held his own against the Spaniards and an Anglo-Sicilian\r\nexpedition. But in regard to the rest of Spain, Soult's gloomy\r\nprophecy was fulfilled: \"The loss of Andalusia and the raising of the\r\nsiege of Cadiz are events whose results will be felt throughout the\r\nwhole of Europe.\"\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Cortes, or Parliament, long cooped up in Cadiz, now sought\r\nto put in force the recently devised democratic constitution. It was\r\nhailed with joy by advanced thinkers in the cities, and with loathing\r\nby the clergy, the nobles, the wealthy, and the peasants. But, though\r\nthe Cortes sowed the seeds of political discord, they took one very\r\ncommendable step. They appointed Wellington generalissimo of all the\r\nSpanish armies; and, in a visit which he paid to the Cortes at\r\nChristmastide, he prepared for a real co-operation of Spanish forces\r\nin the next campaign.\r\n\r\nAt that time Napoleon was uneasily looking into the state of Spanish\r\naffairs. As soon as he mastered the contents of the despatches from\r\nMadrid he counselled a course of action that promised, at any rate, to\r\npostpone the overthrow of his power. The advice is set forth in\r\nletters written on January 4th and February 12th by the Minister of\r\nWar, General Clarke; for Napoleon had practically ceased to correspond\r\nwith his brother. In the latter of these despatches Clarke explained\r\nin some detail the urgent need of acting at once, while the English\r\nwere inactive, so as to stamp out the ever-spreading flame of revolt\r\nin the northern provinces. Two French armies, that of the North and\r\nthe so-called \"Army of Portugal,\" were to be told off for this duty;\r\nand Joseph was informed that his armies of the south and of the centre\r\nwould for the present suffice to hold the British in check. As to\r\nJoseph's general course of action, it was thus prescribed:\r\n\r\n    \"The Emperor commands me to reiterate to your Majesty that the use\r\n    of Valladolid as a residence and as headquarters is an\r\n    indispensable preliminary. From that place must be sent out on the\r\n    Burgos road, and on other fit points, the troops which are to\r\n    strengthen or to second the army of the north. Madrid, and even\r\n    Valencia, form parts of this system only as posts to be held by\r\n    your extreme left, not as places to be kept by a concentration of\r\n    forces.... To occupy Valladolid and Salamanca, to use the utmost\r\n    exertion to pacify Navarre and Arragon to keep the communication\r\n    with France rapid and safe, to be always ready to take the\r\n    offensive--these are the Emperor's instructions for the campaign,\r\n    and the principles on which all its operations ought to be\r\n    founded....\"[309]\r\n\r\nA fortnight later, Clarke bade the King threaten Ciudad Rodrigo so as\r\nto make Wellington believe that the French would invade Portugal. He\r\nwas also to lay heavy contributions on Madrid and Toledo. In fact, the\r\ncapital was to be held only as long as it could be squeezed.\r\n\r\nSuch were the plans. They show clearly that the Emperor was impressed\r\nwith the need of crushing the rising in the north of Spain; for he\r\nordered as great a force against Mina and his troublesome bands as he\r\ndeemed necessary to watch the Portuguese frontier. Clausel was charged\r\nto stamp out the northern rising, and Napoleon seems to have judged\r\nthat this hardy fighter would end this tedious task before Wellington\r\ndealt any serious blows. The miscalculation was to be fatal. Mina was\r\nnot speedily to be beaten, nor was the British general the slow\r\nunenterprising leader that the Emperor took him to be. And then again,\r\nin spite of all the experiences of the past, Napoleon failed to allow\r\nfor the delays caused by the capture of his couriers, or by their long\r\ndetours. Yet, never were these more serious. Clarke's first urgent\r\ndespatch, that of January 4th, did not reach the King until February\r\n16th.[310] When its directions were being doubtfully obeyed, those\r\nquoted above arrived on March 12th, and led to changes in the\r\ndisposition of the troops. Thus the forces opposed to Wellington were\r\nweakened in order to crush the northern revolt, and yet these\r\ndetachments were only sent north at the close of March for a difficult\r\nenterprise which was not to be completed before the British leader\r\nthrew his sword decisively into the scales of war.\r\n\r\nJoseph has been severely blamed for his tardy action: but, in truth,\r\nhe was in a hopeless _impasse_: on all sides he saw the walls of his\r\nroyal prison house closing in. The rebels in the north cut off the\r\nFrench despatches, thus forestalling his movements and delaying by\r\nsome weeks his execution of Napoleon's plans. Worst of all, the\r\nEmperor withdrew the pith and marrow of his forces: 1,200 officers,\r\n6,000 non-commissioned officers, and some 24,000 of the most seasoned\r\nsoldiers filed away towards France to put strength and firmness into\r\nthe new levies of the line, or to fill out again the skeleton\r\nbattalions and squadrons of the Imperial Guard.[311]\r\n\r\nIt is strange that Napoleon did not withdraw all his troops from\r\nSpain. They still exceeded 150,000 men; and yet, after he had flung\r\naway army after army, the Spaniards were everywhere in arms, except in\r\nValencia. The north defied all the efforts of Clausel for several\r\nweeks, until he declared that it would take 50,000 men three months to\r\ncrush the mountaineers.[312] Above all, Wellington was known to be\r\nmustering a formidable force on the Portuguese borders. In truth,\r\nNapoleon seems long to have been afflicted with political colour\r\nblindness in Spanish affairs. Even now he only dimly saw the\r\nridiculous falsity of his brother's position--a parvenu among the\r\nproudest nobility in the world, a bankrupt King called upon to keep up\r\nregal pomp before a ceremonious race, a benevolent ruler forced to\r\nlevy heavy loans and contributions on a sensitive populace whose\r\ngoodwill he earnestly strove to gain, an easy-going epicure spurred on\r\nto impetuous action by orders from Paris which he dared not disregard\r\nand could not execute, a peace-loving valetudinarian upon whom was\r\nthrust the task of controlling testy French Marshals, and of holding a\r\nnation in check and Wellington at bay.\r\n\r\nThe concentration on which Napoleon laid such stress would doubtless\r\nhave proved a most effective step had the French forces on the Douro\r\nbeen marshalled by an able leader. But here, again, the situation had\r\nbeen fatally compromised by the recall of the ablest of the French\r\ncommanders in Spain. Wellington afterwards said that Soult was second\r\nonly to Masséna among the French Marshals pitted against him. He had\r\nsome defects. \"He did not quite understand a field of battle: he was\r\nan excellent tactician, knew very well how to bring his troops up to\r\nthe field, but not so well how to use them when he had brought them\r\nup.\"[313] But the fact remains that, with the exception of his Oporto\r\nfailure, Soult came with credit, if not glory, out of every campaign\r\nwaged against Wellington. Yet he was now recalled.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this vain and ambitious man had mortally offended King Joseph.\r\nAfter Salamanca he had treated him with gross disrespect. Not only did\r\nhe, at first, refuse to move from Andalusia, but he secretly revealed\r\nto six French generals his fears that Joseph was betraying the French\r\ncause by treating with the Spanish national government at Cadiz. He\r\neven warned Clarke of the King's supposed intentions, in a letter\r\nwhich by chance fell into Joseph's hands.[314] The hot blood of the\r\nBonapartes boiled at this underhand dealing, and he at once despatched\r\nColonel Desprez to Napoleon to demand Soult's instant recall. The\r\nEmperor, who was then at Moscow, temporized. Perhaps he was not sorry\r\nto have in Spain so vigilant an informer; and he made the guarded\r\nreply that Soult's suspicions did not much surprise him, that they\r\nwere shared by many other French generals, who thought King Joseph\r\npreferred Spain to France, and that he could not recall Soult, as he\r\nhad \"the only military head in Spain.\" The threatening war-cloud in\r\nCentral Europe led Napoleon to change his resolve. Soult was recalled,\r\nbut not disgraced, and, after the death of Bessières, he received the\r\ncommand of the Imperial Guard.\r\n\r\nThe commander who now bore the brunt of responsibility was Jourdan,\r\nwho acted as major-general at the King's side, a post which he had\r\nheld once before, but had forfeited owing to his blunders in the\r\nsummer of 1809. The victor of Fleurus was now fifty-one years of age,\r\nand his failing health quite unfitted him for the Herculean tasks of\r\nguiding refractory generals, and of propping up a tottering monarchy.\r\nFor Jourdan's talents Napoleon had expressed but scanty esteem,\r\nwhereas on many occasions he extolled the abilities of Suchet, who was\r\nnow holding down Valencia and Catalonia. Certainly Suchet's tenacity\r\nand administrative skill rendered his stay in those rich provinces\r\nhighly desirable. But the best talent was surely needed on\r\nWellington's line of advance, namely, at Valladolid. To the\r\nshortcomings and mishaps of Joseph and Jourdan in that quarter may be\r\nchiefly ascribed the collapse of the French power.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the only part of Spain that now really interested Napoleon\r\nwas the north and north-east. So long as he firmly held the provinces\r\nnorth of the Ebro, he seems to have cared little whether Joseph\r\nreigned, or did not reign, at Madrid. All that concerned him was to\r\nhold the British at bay from the line of the Douro, while French\r\nauthority was established in the north and north-east. This he was\r\ndetermined to keep; and probably he had already formed the design,\r\nlater on to be mooted to Ferdinand VII. at Valençay, of restoring him\r\nto the throne of Spain and of indemnifying him with Portugal for the\r\nloss of the north-eastern provinces. This scheme may even have formed\r\npart of a plan of general pacification; for at Dresden, on May 17th,\r\nhe proposed to Austria the admission of representatives of the Spanish\r\n_insurgents_ to the European Congress. But it is time to turn from the\r\nhaze of conjecture to the sharp outlines of Wellington's\r\ncampaign.[315]\r\n\r\nWhile the French cause in Spain was crumbling to pieces, that of the\r\npatriots was being firmly welded together by the organizing genius of\r\nWellington. By patient efforts, he soon had the Spanish and Portuguese\r\ncontingents in an efficient condition: and, as large reinforcements\r\nhad come from England, he was able early in May to muster 70,000\r\nBritish and Portuguese troops and 30,000 Spaniards for a move\r\neastwards. Murray's force tied Suchet fast to the province of\r\nValencia; Clausel was fully employed in Navarre, and thus Joseph's\r\narmy on the Douro was left far too weak to stem Wellington's tide of\r\nwar. Only some 45,000 French were ready in the districts between\r\nSalamanca and Valladolid. Others remained in the basin of the Tagus in\r\ncase the allies should burst in by that route.\r\n\r\nWellington kept up their illusions by feints at several points, while\r\nhe prepared to thrust a mighty force over the fords of the Tormes and\r\nEsla. He completely succeeded. While Joseph and Jourdan were haltingly\r\nmustering their forces in Leon, the allies began that series of rapid\r\nflanking movements on the north which decided the campaign. Swinging\r\nforward his powerful left wing he manoeuvred the French out of one\r\nstrong position after another. The Tormes, the Esla, the Douro, the\r\nCarrion, the Pisuerga, none of these streams stopped his advance.\r\nJoseph nowhere showed fight; he abandoned even the castle of Burgos,\r\nand, fearing to be cut off from France, retired behind the upper Ebro.\r\n\r\nThe official excuse given for this rapid retreat was the lack of\r\nprovisions: but the diaries of two British officers, Tomkinson and\r\nSimmons, show that they found the country between the Esla and the\r\nEbro for the most part well stocked and fertile. Simmons, who was with\r\nthe famous Light Division, notes that the Rifles did not fire a shot\r\nafter breaking up their winter quarters, until they skirmished with\r\nthe French in the hills near the source of the Ebro. The French\r\nretreat was really necessary in order to bring the King's forces into\r\ntouch with the corps of Generals Clausel and Foy, in Navarre and\r\nBiscay respectively. Joseph had already sent urgent orders to call in\r\nthese corps; for, as he explained to Clarke, the supreme need now was\r\nto beat Wellington; that done, the partisan warfare would collapse.\r\n\r\nBut Clausel and Foy took their orders, not from the King, but from\r\nParis; and up to June 5th, Joseph heard not a word from Clausel. At\r\nlast, on June 15th, that general wrote from Pamplona that he had\r\nreceived Joseph's commands of May 30th and June 7th, and would march\r\nto join him. Had he at once called in his mobile columns and covered\r\nwith all haste the fifty miles that separated him from the King, the\r\nFrench army would have been the stronger by at least 14,000 men. But\r\nhis concentration was a work of some difficulty, and he finally drew\r\nnear to Vittoria on June 22nd, when the French cause was irrecoverably\r\nlost.[316]\r\n\r\nWellington, meanwhile, had foreseen the supreme need of despatch.\r\nEarly in the year he had urged our naval authorities to strengthen our\r\nsquadron on the north of Spain, so that he might in due course make\r\nSantander his base of supplies. Naval support was not forthcoming to\r\nthe extent that he expected;[317] but after leaving Burgos he was able\r\nto make some use of the northern ports, thereby shortening his line of\r\ncommunications. In fact, the Vittoria campaign illustrates the immense\r\nadvantages gained by a leader, who is sure of his rear and of one\r\nflank, over an enemy who is ever nervous about his communications. The\r\nBritish squadron acted like a covering force on the north to\r\nWellington: it fed the guerilla warfare in Biscay, and menaced Joseph\r\nwith real though invisible dangers. This explains, in large measure,\r\nwhy our commander moved forward so rapidly, and pushed forward his\r\nleft wing with such persistent daring. Mountain fastnesses and roaring\r\ntorrents stayed not the advance of his light troops on that side. Near\r\nthe sources of the Ebro, the French again felt their communications\r\nwith France threatened, and falling back from the main stream, up the\r\ndefile carved out by a tributary, the Zadora, they halted wearily in\r\nthe basin of Vittoria.\r\n\r\nThere Joseph and Jourdan determined to fight. As usual, there had been\r\nrecriminations at headquarters. \"Jourdan, ill and angry, kept his\r\nroom; and the King was equally invisible.\"[318] Few orders were given.\r\nThe town was packed with convoys and vehicles of all kinds, and it was\r\nnot till dawn of that fatal midsummer's day that the last convoy set\r\nout for France, under the escort of 3,000 troops. Nevertheless, Joseph\r\nmight hope to hold his own. True, he had but 70,000 troops at hand, or\r\nperhaps even fewer; yet on the evening of the 19th he heard that\r\nClausel had set out from Pamplona.\r\n\r\nAt once he bade him press on his march, but that message fell into the\r\nenemy's hands.[319] Relying, then, on help which was not to arrive,\r\nJoseph confronted the allied army. It numbered, in all, 83,000 men,\r\nthough Napier asserts that not more than 60,000 took part in the\r\nfighting. The French left wing rested on steep hills near Puebla,\r\nwhich tower above the River Zadora, and leave but a narrow defile.\r\nTheir centre held a less precipitous ridge, which trends away to the\r\nnorth parallel to the middle reaches of that stream. Higher up its\r\ncourse, the Zadora describes a sharp curve that protects the ridge on\r\nits northern flank; and if a daring foe drove the defenders away from\r\nthese heights, they could still fall back on two lower ridges nearer\r\nVittoria. But these natural advantages were not utilized to the full.\r\nThe bridges opposite the French front were not broken, and the\r\ndefenders were far too widely spread out. Their right wing, consisting\r\nof the \"Army of Portugal\" under General Reille, guarded the bridge\r\nnorth of Vittoria, and was thus quite out of touch with the main force\r\nthat held the hills five miles away to the west.\r\n\r\nThe dawn broke heavily; the air was thick with rain and driving mists,\r\nunder cover of which Hill's command moved up against the steeps of\r\nPuebla. A Spanish brigade, under General Morillo, nimbly scaled those\r\nslopes on the south-west, gained a footing near the summit, and, when\r\nreinforced, firmly held their ground. Meanwhile the rest of Hill's\r\ntroops threaded their way beneath through the pass of Puebla, and,\r\nafter a tough fight, wrested the village of Subijana from the foe. In\r\nvain did Joseph and Jourdan bring up troops from the centre; the\r\nBritish and Spaniards were not to be driven either from the village or\r\nfrom the heights. Wellington's main array was also advancing to attack\r\nthe French centre occupying the ridge behind the Zadora; and Graham,\r\nafter making a long détour to the north through very broken country,\r\nsought to surprise Reille and drive him from the bridge north of\r\nVittoria. In this advance the guidance of the Spanish irregulars,\r\nunder Colonel Longa, was of priceless value. So well was Graham\r\ncovered by their bands, that, up to the moment of attack, Reille knew\r\nnot that a British division was also at hand. At the centre, too, a\r\nSpanish peasant informed Wellington that the chief bridge of Tres\r\nPuentes was unguarded, and guided Kempt's brigade through rocky ground\r\nto within easy charging distance.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: BATTLE OF VITTORIA]\r\n\r\nThe bridge was seized, Joseph's outposts were completely turned, and\r\ntime was given for the muster of Picton's men. Stoutly they breasted\r\nthe slopes, and unsteadied the weakened French centre, which was also\r\nassailed on its northern flank. At the same time Joseph's left wing\r\nbegan to waver under Hill's repeated onslaughts; and, distracted by\r\nthe distant cannonade, which told of a stubborn fight between Graham\r\nand Reille, the King now began to draw in his lines towards Vittoria.\r\nFor a time the French firmly held the village of Arinez, but Picton's\r\nmen were not to be denied. They burst through the rearguard, and the\r\nbattle now became a running fight, extending over some five miles of\r\nbroken country. At the last slopes, close to Vittoria, the defenders\r\nmade a last heroic stand, and their artillery dealt havoc among the\r\nassailants; but our fourth division, rushing forward into the smoke,\r\ncarried a hill that commanded their left, and the day was won. Nothing\r\nnow remained for the French but a speedy retreat, while the gallant\r\nReille could still hold Graham's superior force at bay.\r\n\r\nThere, too, the fight at last swirled back, albeit with many a\r\nrallying eddy, into Vittoria. That town was no place of refuge, but a\r\ndeath-trap; for Graham had pushed on a detachment to Durana, on the\r\nhigh-road leading direct to France, and thus blocked the main line of\r\nretreat. Joseph's army was now in pitiable plight. Pent up in the\r\nchoked streets of Vittoria, torn by cannon-shot from the English\r\nlines, the wreckage of its three armies for a time surged helplessly\r\nto and fro, and then broke away eastwards towards Pamplona. On that\r\nside only was safety to be found, for British hussars scoured the\r\nplain to the north-east, lending wings to the flight. The narrow\r\ncauseway, leading through marshes, was soon blocked, and panic seized\r\non all: artillerymen cut their traces and fled; carriages crowded with\r\nwomen, once called gay, but now frantic with terror, wagons laden with\r\nammunition, stores, treasure-chests, and the booty amassed by generals\r\nand favourites during five years of warfare and extortion, all were\r\nleft pell-mell. Jourdan's Marshal's baton was taken, and was sent by\r\nWellington to the Prince Regent, who acknowledged it by conferring on\r\nthe victor the title of Field-Marshal.\r\n\r\nRichly was the title deserved. After four years of battling with\r\nsuperior numbers, the British leader at last revealed the full majesty\r\nof his powers now that the omens were favourable. In six weeks he\r\nmarched more than five hundred miles, crossed six rivers, and, using\r\nthe Navarrese revolt as the anvil, dealt the hammer-stroke of\r\nVittoria. It cost Napoleon 151 pieces of cannon, nearly all the stores\r\npiled up for his Peninsular campaigns--and Spain itself.[320]\r\n\r\nAs for Joseph, he left his carriage and fled on horseback towards\r\nFrance, reaching St. Jean de Luz \"with only a napoleon left.\" He there\r\nalso assured his queen that he had always preferred a private station\r\nto the grandeur and agitations of public life.[321] This, indeed, was\r\none of the many weak points of his brother's Spanish policy. It rested\r\non the shoulders of an amiable man who was better suited to the ease\r\nof Naples than to the Herculean toils of Madrid. Napoleon now saw the\r\nmagnitude of his error. On July 1st he bade Soult leave Dresden at\r\nonce for Paris. There he was to call on Clarke, with him repair to\r\nCambacérès; and, as Lieutenant-General, take steps to re-establish the\r\nEmperor's affairs in Spain. A Regency was to govern in place of\r\nJoseph, who was ordered to remain, according to the state of affairs,\r\neither at Burgos(!) or St. Sebastian or Bayonne.\r\n\r\n    \"All the follies in Spain\" (he wrote to Cambacérès on that day)\r\n    \"are due to the mistaken consideration I have shown the King, who\r\n    not only does not know how to command, but does not even know his\r\n    own value enough to leave the military command alone.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to Savary he wrote two days later:\r\n\r\n    \"It is hard to imagine anything so inconceivable as what is now\r\n    going on in Spain. The King could have collected 100,000 picked\r\n    men: _they might have beaten the whole of England_.\"\r\n\r\nReflection, however, showed him that the fault was his own; that if,\r\nas had occurred to him when he left Paris, he had intrusted the\r\nsupreme command in Spain to Soult, the disaster would never have\r\nhappened.[322] His belief in Soult's capacity was justified by the\r\nlast events of the Peninsular War. But neither his splendid rally of\r\nthe scattered French forces, nor the skilful movements of Clausel and\r\nSuchet, nor the stubborn defence of Pamplona and San Sebastian, could\r\nnow save the French cause. The sole result of these last operations\r\nwas to restore the lustre of the French arms and to keep 150,000 men\r\nin Spain when the scales of war were wavering in the plains of Saxony.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's letters betray the agitation which he felt even at the\r\nfirst vague rumours of the disaster of Vittoria. On the first three\r\ndays of July he penned at Dresden seven despatches on that topic in a\r\nstyle so vehement that the compilers of the \"Correspondance de\r\nNapoléon\" have thought it best to omit them. He further enjoined the\r\nutmost reserve, and ordered the official journals merely to state\r\nthat, after a brisk engagement at Vittoria, the French army was\r\nconcentrating in Arragon, and that the British had captured about a\r\nhundred guns and wagons left behind in the town for lack of horses.\r\n\r\nThere was every reason for hiding the truth. He saw how seriously it\r\nmust weaken his chances of browbeating the Eastern Powers, and of\r\npunishing Austria for her armed mediation. Hitherto there seemed every\r\nchance of his succeeding. The French standards flew on all the\r\nfortresses of the Elbe and Oder. Hamburg was fast becoming a great\r\nFrench camp, and Denmark was ranged on the side of France.\r\n\r\nIndeed, on reviewing the situation on June 4th, the German publicist,\r\nGentz, came to the conclusion that the Emperor Francis would probably\r\nend his vacillations by some inglorious compromise. The Kaiser desired\r\npeace; but he also wished to shake off the irksome tutelage of his\r\nson-in-law, and regain Illyria. For the present he wavered. Before the\r\nnews of Lützen reached him, he undoubtedly encouraged the allies: but\r\nthat reverse brought about a half left turn towards Napoleon. \"Boney's\r\nsuccess at Lützen,\" wrote Sir G. Jackson in his Diary, \"has made\r\nFrancis reconsider his half-formed resolutions.\" Here was the chief\r\ndifficulty for the allies. Their fortunes, and the future of Europe,\r\nrested largely on the decision of a man whose natural irresolution of\r\ncharacter had been increased by adversity. Fortunately, the news from\r\nSpain finally helped to incline him towards war; but for some weeks\r\nhis decision remained the unknown quantity in European politics.\r\nFortunately, too, he was amenable to the gentle but determining\r\npressure of the kind which Metternich could so skilfully exert. That\r\nstatesman, as usual, schemed and balanced. He saw that Austria had\r\nmuch to gain by playing the waiting game. Her forces were improving\r\nboth in numbers and efficiency, and under cover of her offer of armed\r\nmediation were holding strong positions in Bohemia. In fact, she was\r\nregaining her prestige, and might hope to impose her will on the\r\ncombatants at the forthcoming European Congress at Prague. Metternich,\r\ntherefore, continued to pose as the well-wisher of both parties and\r\nthe champion of a reasonable and therefore durable compromise.\r\n\r\nHe had acted thus, not only in his choice of measures, but in his\r\nselection of men. He had sent to Napoleon's headquarters at Dresden\r\nCount Bubna, whose sincere and resolute striving for peace served to\r\nlull animosity and suspicions in that place. But to the allied\r\nheadquarters, now at Reichenbach, he had despatched Count Stadion, who\r\nworked no less earnestly for war. While therefore the Courts of St.\r\nPetersburg, Berlin, and London hoped, from Stadion's language, that\r\nAustria meant to draw the sword, Napoleon inclined to the belief that\r\nshe would never do more than rattle her scabbard, and would finally\r\nyield to his demands.\r\n\r\nStadion's letters to Metternich show that he feared this result. He\r\npressed him to end the seesaw policy of the last six months. \"These\r\npeople are beaten owing to our faults, our half wishes, our half\r\nmeasures, and presently they will get out of the scrape and leave us\r\nto pay the price.\" As for Austria's forthcoming demand of Illyria, who\r\nwould guarantee that the French Emperor would let her keep it six\r\nmonths, if he remained master of Germany and Italy? Only by a close\r\nunion with the allies could she be screened from Napoleon's vengeance,\r\nwhich must otherwise lead to her utter destruction. Let, then, all\r\ntimid counsellors be removed from the side of the Emperor Francis. \"I\r\ncling to my oft-expressed conviction that we are no longer masters of\r\nour own affairs, and that the tide of events will carry us\r\nalong.\"[323] If we may judge from Metternich's statements in his\r\n\"Memoirs,\" written many years later, he was all along in secret\r\nsympathy with these views. But his actions and his official despatches\r\nduring the first six weeks of the armistice bore another complexion;\r\nthey were almost colourless, or rather, they were chameleonic. At\r\nDresden they seemed, on the whole, to be favourable to France: at\r\nReichenbach, when coloured by Stadion, they were thought to hold out\r\nthe prospect of another European coalition.\r\n\r\nA new and important development was given to Austrian policy when, on\r\nJune 7th, Metternich drew up the conditions on which Austria would\r\ninsist as the basis of her armed mediation. They were as follows: (1)\r\nDissolution of the Duchy of Warsaw; (2) A consequent reconstruction of\r\nPrussia, with the certainty of recovering Danzig; (3) Restitution of\r\nthe Illyrian provinces, including Dalmatia, to Austria; (4)\r\nRe-establishment of the Hanse Towns, and an eventual arrangement as to\r\nthe cession of the other parts of the 32nd military division [the part\r\nof North Germany annexed by Napoleon in 1810]. To these were added two\r\nother conditions on which Austria would lay great stress, namely: (5)\r\nDissolution of the Confederation of the Rhine; (6) Reconstruction of\r\nPrussia conformably with her territorial extent previous to 1805.\r\n\r\nAt first sight these terms seem favourable to the allied cause; but\r\nthey were much less extensive than the proposals submitted by\r\nAlexander in the middle of May. Therefore, when they were set forth to\r\nthe allies at Reichenbach, they were unfavourably received, and for\r\nsome days suspicion of Austria overclouded the previous goodwill. It\r\nwas removed only by the labours of Stadion and by the tact which\r\nMetternich displayed during an interview with the Czar at Opotschna\r\n(June 17th).\r\n\r\nAlexander came there prejudiced against Metternich as a past master in\r\nthe arts of double-dealing: he went away convinced that he meant well\r\nfor the allies. \"What will become of us,\" asked the Czar, \"if Napoleon\r\naccepts your mediation?\" To which the statesman replied: \"If he\r\nrefuses it, the truce will be at an end, and you will find us in the\r\nranks of your allies. If he accepts it, the negotiations will prove to\r\na certainty that Napoleon is neither wise nor just; and the issue will\r\nbe the same.\" Alexander knew enough of his great enemy's character to\r\ndiscern the sagacity of Metternich's forecast; and both Frederick\r\nWilliam and he agreed to the Austrian terms.[324] Accordingly, on June\r\n27th, a treaty was secretly signed at Reichenbach, wherein Austria\r\npledged herself to an active alliance with Russia and Prussia in case\r\nNapoleon should not, by the end of the armistice, have acceded to her\r\nfour _conditiones sine quibus non._ To these was now added a demand\r\nfor the evacuation of all Polish and Prussian fortresses by French\r\ntroops, a stipulation which it was practically certain that Napoleon\r\nwould refuse.[325]\r\n\r\nThe allies meanwhile were gaining the sinews of war from England. The\r\nCzar had informed Cathcart at Kalisch that, though he did not press\r\nour Government for subsidies, yet he would not be able to wage a long\r\ncampaign without such aid. On June 14th and 15th, our ambassador\r\nsigned treaties with Russia and Prussia, whereby we agreed to aid the\r\nformer by a yearly subsidy of £1,133,334, and the latter by a sum of\r\nhalf that amount, and to meet all the expenses of the Russian fleet\r\nthen in our harbours. The Czar and the King of Prussia bound\r\nthemselves to maintain in the field (exclusive of garrisons) 160,000\r\nand 80,000 men respectively.[326]\r\n\r\nThere was every reason for these preparations. Everything showed that\r\nNapoleon was bent on browbeating the allies. On June 17th Napoleon's\r\ntroops destroyed or captured Lützow's volunteers at Kitzen near\r\nLeipzig. The excuse for this act was that Lützow had violated the\r\narmistice; but he had satisfied Nisas, the French officer there in\r\ncommand, that he was loyally observing it. Nevertheless, his brigade\r\nwas cut to pieces. The protests of the allies received no response\r\nexcept that Lützow's men might be exchanged--as if they had been\r\ncaptured in fair fight. Finally, Napoleon refused to hear the\r\nstatement of Nisas in his own justification, reproached him for\r\ncasting a slur on the conduct of French troops, and deprived him of\r\nhis command.[327]\r\n\r\nBut it was Napoleon's bearing towards Metternich, in an interview held\r\non June 26th at the Marcolini Palace at Dresden, that most clearly\r\nrevealed the inflexibility of his policy. Ostensibly, the interview\r\nwas fixed in order to arrange the forms of the forthcoming Congress\r\nthat was to insure the world's peace. In reality, however, Napoleon\r\nhoped to intimidate the Austrian statesman, and to gather from him the\r\nresults of his recent interview with the Czar. Carrying his sword at\r\nhis side and his hat under his arm, he received Metternich in state.\r\nAfter a few studied phrases about the health of the Emperor Francis,\r\nhis brow clouded and he plunged _in medias res_: \"So you too want war:\r\nwell, you shall have it. I have beaten the Russians at Bautzen: now\r\nyou wish your turn to come. Be it so, the rendezvous shall be in\r\nVienna. Men are incorrigible: experience is lost upon you. Three times\r\nI have replaced the Emperor Francis on his throne. I have promised\r\nalways to live at peace with him: I have married his daughter. At the\r\ntime I said to myself--you are perpetrating a folly; but it was done,\r\nand now I repent of it.\"\r\n\r\nMetternich saw his advantage: his adversary had lost his temper and\r\nforgotten his dignity. He calmly reminded Napoleon that peace depended\r\non him; that his power must be reduced within reasonable limits, or he\r\nwould fall in the ensuing struggle. No matador fluttered the cloak\r\nmore dextrously. Napoleon rushed on. No coalition should daunt him: he\r\ncould overpower any number of men--everything except the cold of\r\nRussia--and the losses of that campaign had been made good. He then\r\ndiverged into stories about that war, varied by digressions as to his\r\nexact knowledge of Austria's armaments, details of which were sent to\r\nhim daily. To end this wandering talk, Metternich reminded him that\r\nhis troops now were not men but boys. Whereupon the Emperor\r\npassionately replied: \"You do not know what goes on in the mind of a\r\nsoldier; a man such as I does not take much heed of the lives of a\r\nmillion of men,\"--and he threw aside his hat. Metternich did not pick\r\nit up.\r\n\r\nNapoleon noticed the unspoken defiance, and wound up by saying: \"When\r\nI married an Archduchess I tried to weld the new with the old, Gothic\r\nprejudices with the institutions of my century: I deceived myself, and\r\nthis day I see the whole extent of my error. It may cost me my throne,\r\nbut I will bury the world beneath its ruins.\" In dismissing\r\nMetternich, the Emperor used the device which, shortly before the\r\nrupture with England in 1803, he had recommended Talleyrand to employ\r\nupon Whitworth, namely, after trying intimidation to resort to\r\ncajolery. Touching the Minister on the shoulder, he said quietly:\r\n\"Well, now, do you know what will happen? You will not make war on\r\nme?\" To which came the quick reply: \"You are lost, Sire; I had the\r\npresentiment of it when I came: now, in going, I have the certainty.\"\r\nIn the anteroom the generals crowded around the illustrious visitor.\r\nBerthier had previously begged him to remember that Europe, and\r\nFrance, urgently needed peace; and now, on conducting him to his\r\ncarriage, he asked him whether he was satisfied with Napoleon. \"Yes,\"\r\nwas the answer, \"he has explained everything to me: it is all over\r\nwith the man.\"[328]\r\n\r\nSubstantially, this was the case. Napoleon's resentment against\r\nAustria, not unnatural under the circumstances, had hurried him into\r\noutbursts that revealed the inner fires of his passion. In a second\r\ninterview, on June 30th, he was far more gracious, and allowed Austria\r\nto hope that she would gain Illyria. He also accepted Austria's\r\nmediation; and it was stipulated that a Congress should meet at Prague\r\nfor the discussion of a general pacification. Metternich appeared\r\nhighly pleased with this condescension, but he knew by experience that\r\nNapoleon's caresses were as dangerous as his wrath; and he remained on\r\nhis guard. The Emperor soon disclosed his real aim. In gracious tones\r\nhe added: \"But this is not all: I must have a prolongation of the\r\narmistice. How can we between July 5th and 20th end a negotiation\r\nwhich ought to embrace the whole world?\" He proposed August 20th as\r\nthe date of its expiration. To this Metternich demurred because the\r\nallies already thought the armistice too long for their interests.\r\nAugust 10th was finally agreed on, but not without much opposition on\r\nthe part of the allied generals, who insisted that such a prolongation\r\nwould greatly embarrass them.\r\n\r\nOutwardly, this new arrangement seemed to portend peace: but it is\r\nsignificant that on June 28th Napoleon wrote to Eugène that all the\r\nprobabilities appeared for war; and on June 30th he wrote his\r\nfather-in-law a cold and almost threatening letter.[329]\r\n\r\nLate on that very evening came to hand the first report of the\r\ndisaster of Vittoria. Despite all Napoleon's precautions, the news\r\nleaked out at Dresden. Bubna's despatches of July 5th, 6th, and 7th\r\nsoon made it known to the Emperor Francis, then at Brandeis in\r\nBohemia. Thence it reached the allied monarchs and Bernadotte on July\r\n12th at Trachenberg in the midst of negotiations which will be\r\ndescribed presently. The effect of the news was very great. The Czar\r\nat once ordered a Te Deum to be sung: \"It is the first instance,\"\r\nwrote Cathcart, \"of a Te Deum having been sung at this Court for a\r\nvictory in which the forces of the Russian Empire were not\r\nengaged.\"[330] But its results were more than ceremonial: they were\r\npractical. Our envoy, Thornton, who followed Bernadotte to\r\nTrachenberg, states that Bubna had learnt that Wellington had\r\ncompletely routed three French corps with a _débandade_ like that of\r\nthe retreat from Moscow. Thornton adds: \"The Prince Royal [Bernadotte]\r\nthinks that the French army will be very soon withdrawn from Silesia\r\nand that Buonaparte must soon commence his retreat nearer the Rhine. I\r\nhave no doubt of its effect upon Austria. This is visible in the\r\nanswer of the Emperor [Francis] to the Prince, which came to-day from\r\nthe Austrian head-quarters.\" That letter, dated July 9th, was indeed\r\nof the most cordial character. It expressed great pleasure at hearing\r\nthat \"the obstacles which seemed to hinder the co-operation of the\r\nforces under your Royal Highness are now removed. I regard this\r\nco-operation as one of the surest supports of the cause which the\r\nPowers may once more be called on to defend by a war which can only\r\noffer chances of success unless sustained by the greatest and most\r\nunanimous measures.\"[331] Further than this Francis could scarcely go\r\nwithout pledging himself unconditionally to an alliance; and doubtless\r\nit was the news of Vittoria that evoked these encouraging assurances.\r\n\r\nIt is even more certain that the compact of Trachenberg also helped to\r\nend the hesitations of Austria. This compact arose out of the urgent\r\nneed of adopting a general plan of campaign, and, above all, of ending\r\nthe disputes between the allied sovereigns and Bernadotte. The Prince\r\nRoyal of Sweden had lost their confidence through his failure to save\r\nHamburg from the French and Danes. Yet, on his side, he had some cause\r\nfor complaint. In the previous summer, Alexander led him to expect the\r\nactive aid of 35,000 Russian troops for a campaign in Norway: but,\r\nmainly at the instance of England, he now landed in Pomerania and left\r\nSweden exposed to a Danish attack on the side of Norway. He therefore\r\nsuggested an interview with the allied sovereigns, a request which was\r\nwarmly seconded by Castlereagh.[332] Accordingly it took place at\r\nTrachenberg, a castle north of Breslau, with the happiest results. The\r\nwarmth of the great Gascon's manner cleared away all clouds, and won\r\nthe approval of Frederick William.\r\n\r\nThere was signed the famous compact, or plan, of Trachenberg (July\r\n12th). It bound the allies to turn their main forces against\r\nNapoleon's chief army, wherever it was: those allied corps that\r\nthreatened his flanks or communications were to act on the line that\r\nmost directly cut into them: and the salient bastion of Bohemia was\r\nexpressly named as offering the greatest advantages for attacking\r\nNapoleon's main force. The first and third of these axioms were\r\ndirectly framed so as to encourage Austria: the second aimed at\r\nconcentrating Bernadotte's force on the main struggle and preventing\r\nhis waging war merely against Denmark.\r\n\r\nThe plan went even further: 100,000 allied troops were to be sent into\r\nBohemia, as soon as the armistice should cease, so as to form in all\r\nan army of 200,000 men. On the north, Bernadotte, after detaching a\r\ncorps towards Hamburg, was to advance with a Russo-Prusso-Swedish army\r\nof 70,000 men towards the middle course of the Elbe, his objective\r\nbeing Leipzig; and the rest of the allied forces, those remaining in\r\nSilesia, were to march towards Torgau, and thus threaten Napoleon's\r\npositions in Saxony from the East. This plan of campaign was an\r\nimmense advance on those of the earlier coalitions. There was no\r\nreliance here on lines and camps: the days of Mack and Phull were\r\npast: the allies had at last learnt from Napoleon the need of seeking\r\nout the enemy's chief army, and of flinging at it all the available\r\nforces. Politically, also, the compact deserves notice. In concerting\r\na plan of offensive operations from Bohemia, the allies were going far\r\nto determine the conduct of Austria.\r\n\r\nOn that same day the peace Congress was opened at Prague. Its\r\nproceedings were farcical from the outset. Only Anstett and Humboldt,\r\nthe Russian and Prussian envoys, were at hand; and at the appointment\r\nof the former, an Alsatian by birth, Napoleon expressed great\r\nannoyance. The difficulties about the armistice also gave him the\r\nopportunity, which he undoubtedly sought, of further delaying\r\nnegotiations. In vain did Metternich point out to the French envoy,\r\nNarbonne, at Prague, that these frivolous delays must lead to war if\r\nmatters were not amicably settled by August 10th, at midnight.[333] In\r\nvain did Narbonne and Caulaincourt beg their master to seize this\r\nopportunity for concluding a safe and honourable peace. It was not\r\ntill the middle of July that he appointed them his plenipotentiaries\r\nat the Congress; and, even then, he retained the latter at Dresden,\r\nwhile the former fretted in forced inaction at Prague. \"I send you\r\nmore _powers_ than _power_,\" wrote Maret to Narbonne with cynical\r\njauntiness: \"you will have your hands tied, but your legs and mouth\r\nfree so that you may walk about and dine.\"[334] At last, on the 26th,\r\nCaulaincourt received his instructions; but what must have been the\r\nanguish of this loyal son of France to see that Napoleon was courting\r\nwar with a united Europe. Austria, said his master, was acting as\r\nmediator: and the mediator ought not to look for gains: she had made\r\nno sacrifice and deserved to gain nothing at all: her claims were\r\nlimitless; and every concession granted by France would encourage her\r\nto ask for more: he was disposed to make peace with Russia on\r\nsatisfactory terms so as to punish Austria for her bad faith in\r\nbreaking the alliance of 1812.[335]\r\n\r\nSuch trifling with the world's peace seems to belong, not to the\r\nsphere of history, but to the sombre domain of Greek tragedy, where\r\nmortals full blown with pride rush blindly on the embossed bucklers of\r\nfate. For what did Austria demand of him? She proposed to leave him\r\nmaster of all the lands from the swamps of the Ems down to the Roman\r\nCampagna: Italy was to be his, along with as much of the Iberian\r\nPeninsula as he could hold. His control of Illyria, North Germany, and\r\nthe Rhenish Confederation he must give up. But France, Belgium,\r\nHolland, and Italy would surely form a noble realm for a man who had\r\nlost half a million of men, and was even now losing Spain. Yet his\r\ncorrespondence proves that, even so, he thought little of his foes,\r\nand, least of all, of the Congress at Prague.\r\n\r\nLeaving his plenipotentiaries tied down to the discussion of matters\r\nof form, he set out from Dresden on July 24th for a visit to Mainz,\r\nwhere he met the Empress and reviewed his reserves. Every item of news\r\nfed his warlike resolve. Soult, with nearly 100,000 men, was about to\r\nrelieve Pamplona (so he wrote to Caulaincourt): the English were\r\nretiring in confusion: 12,000 veteran horsemen from his armies in\r\nSpain would soon be on the Rhine; but they could not be on the Elbe\r\nbefore September. If the allies wanted a longer armistice, he\r\n(Napoleon) would agree to it: if they wished to fight, he was equally\r\nready, even against the Austrians as well.[336]\r\n\r\nTo Davoust, at Hamburg, he expressed himself as if war was certain;\r\nand he ordered Clarke, at Paris, to have 110,000 muskets made by the\r\nend of the year, so that, in all, 400,000 would be ready. Letters\r\nabout the Congress are conspicuous by their absence; and everything\r\nproves that, as he wrote to Clarke at the beginning of the armistice,\r\nhe purposed striking his great blows in September. Little by little we\r\nsee the emergence of his final plan--_to overthrow Russia and Prussia,\r\nwhile, for a week or two, he amused Austria with separate overtures at\r\nPrague_.\r\n\r\nBut, during eight years of adversity, European statesmen had learnt\r\nthat disunion spelt disaster; and it was evident that Napoleon's\r\ndelays were prompted solely by the need of equipping and training his\r\nnew cavalry brigades. As for the Congress, no one took it seriously.\r\nGentz, who was then in close contact with Metternich, saw how this\r\ntragi-comedy would end. \"We believe that on his return to Dresden,\r\nNapoleon will address to this Court a solemn Note in which he will\r\naccuse everybody of the delays which he himself has caused, and will\r\nend up by proclaiming a sort of ultimatum. Our reply will be a\r\ndeclaration of war.\"[337]\r\n\r\nThis was what happened. As July wore on and brought no peaceful\r\novertures, but rather a tightening of Napoleon's coils in Saxony,\r\nBavaria, and Illyria, the Emperor Francis inclined towards war.\r\nAs late as July 18th he wrote to Metternich that he was still for\r\npeace, provided that Illyria could be gained.[338]\r\n\r\nBut the French military preparations decided him, a few days later, to\r\nmake war, unless every one of the Austrian demands should be conceded\r\nby August 10th. His counsellors had already come to that conclusion,\r\nas our records prove. On July 20th Stadion wrote to Cathcart urging\r\nhim to give pecuniary aid to General Nugent, who would wait on him to\r\nconcert means for rousing a revolt against Napoleon in Tyrol and North\r\nItaly; and our envoy agreed to give £5,000 a month for the \"support of\r\n5,000 Austrians acting in communication with our squadron in the\r\nAdriatic.\" This step met with Metternich's approval; and, when writing\r\nto Stadion from Prague (July 25th), he counselled Cathcart to send a\r\ndespatch to Wellington and urge him to make a vigorous move against\r\nthe south of France. He (Metternich) would have the letter sent safely\r\nthrough Switzerland and the south of France direct to our\r\ngeneral.[339]\r\n\r\nWith the solemn triflings of the Congress we need not concern\r\nourselves. The French plenipotentiaries saw clearly that their master\r\n\"would allow of no peace but that which he should himself dictate with\r\nhis foot on the enemy's neck.\" Yet they persevered in their thankless\r\ntask, for \"who could tell whether the Emperor, when he found himself\r\nplaced between highly favourable conditions and the fear of having\r\n200,000 additional troops against him, might not hesitate; whether\r\njust one grain of common sense, one spark of wisdom, might not enter\r\nhis head?\" Alas! That brain was now impervious to advice; and the\r\nyoung De Broglie, from whom we quote this extract, sums up the opinion\r\nof the French plenipotentiaries in the trenchant phrase, \"the devil\r\nwas in him.\"[340]\r\n\r\nBut there was method in his madness. In the Dresden interview he had\r\nwarned Metternich that not till the eleventh hour would he disclose\r\nhis real demands. And now was the opportunity of trying the effect of\r\na final act of intimidation. On August 4th he was back again in\r\nDresden: on the next day he dictated the secret conditions on which he\r\nwould accept Austria's mediation; and, on August 6th, Caulaincourt\r\npaid Metternich a private visit to find out what Austria's terms\r\nreally were. After a flying visit to the Emperor Francis at Brandeis,\r\nthe Minister brought back as an ultimatum the six terms drawn up on\r\nJune 7th (see p. 316); and to these he now added another which\r\nguaranteed the existing possessions of every State, great or small.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was taken aback by this boldness, which he attributed to the\r\ninfluence of Spanish affairs and to English intrigues.[341] On August\r\n9th he summoned Bubna and offered to give up the Duchy of\r\nWarsaw--provided that the King of Saxony gained an indemnity--also the\r\nIllyrian Provinces (but without Istria), as well as Danzig, if its\r\nfortifications were destroyed. As for the Hanse Towns and North\r\nGermany, he would not hear of letting them go. Bubna thought that\r\nAustria would acquiesce. But she had said her last word: she saw that\r\nNapoleon was trifling with her until he had disposed of Russia and\r\nPrussia. And, at midnight of August 10th, beacon fires on the heights\r\nof the Riesengebirge flashed the glad news to the allies in Silesia\r\nthat they might begin to march their columns into Bohemia. The second\r\nand vaster Act in the drama of liberation had begun.\r\n\r\nDid Napoleon remember, in that crisis of his destiny, that it was\r\nexactly twenty-one years since the downfall of the old French\r\nmonarchy, when he looked forth on the collapse of the royalist defence\r\nat the Tuileries and the fruitless bravery of the Swiss Guards?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nDRESDEN AND LEIPZIG\r\n\r\n\r\nThe militant Revolution had now attained its majority. It had to\r\nconfront an embattled Europe. Hitherto the jealousies or fears of the\r\nEastern Powers had prevented any effective union. The Austro-Prussian\r\nleague of 1792 was of the loosest description owing to the astute\r\nneutrality of the Czarina Catherine. In 1798 and 1805 Prussia seemed\r\nto imitate her policy, and only after Austria had been crushed did the\r\narmy of Frederick the Great try conclusions with Napoleon. In the Jena\r\nand Friedland campaigns, the Hapsburgs played the part of the sulking\r\nAchilles, and met their natural reward in 1809. The war of 1812\r\nmarshalled both Austria and Prussia as vassal States in Napoleon's\r\ncrusade against Russia. But it also brought salvation, and Napoleon's\r\nfateful obstinacy during the negotiations at Prague virtually\r\ncompelled his own father-in-law to draw the sword against him.\r\nOstensibly, the points at issue were finally narrowed down to the\r\ncontrol of the Confederation of the Rhine, the ownership of North\r\nGermany, and a few smaller points. But really there was a deeper\r\ncause, the character of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe vindictiveness with which he had trampled on his foes, his almost\r\nsuperhuman lust of domination, and the halting way in which he met all\r\novertures for a compromise--this it was that drove the Hapsburgs into\r\nan alliance with their traditional foes. His conduct may be explained\r\non diverse grounds, as springing from the vendetta instincts of his\r\nrace, or from his still viewing events through the distorting medium\r\nof the Continental System, or from his ingrained conviction that, at\r\nbottom, rulers are influenced only by intimidation.\r\n\r\nIn any case, he had now succeeded in bringing about the very thing\r\nwhich Charles James Fox had declared to be impossible. In opening the\r\nnegotiations for peace with France in April, 1806, our Foreign\r\nMinister had declared to Talleyrand that \"the project of combining the\r\nwhole of Europe against France is to the last degree chimerical.\" Yet\r\nGreat Britain and the Spanish patriots, after struggling alone against\r\nthe conqueror from 1808 to 1812, saw Russia, Sweden, Prussia, and\r\nAustria, successively range themselves on their side. It is true, the\r\nGermans of the Rhenish Confederation, the Italians, Swiss, and Danes\r\nwere still enrolled under the banners of the new Charlemagne; but,\r\nwith the exception of the last, they fought wearily or questioningly,\r\nas for a cause that promised naught but barren triumphs and unending\r\nstrife.\r\n\r\nTruly, the years that witnessed Napoleon's fall were fruitful in\r\nparadox. The greatest political genius of the age, for lack of the\r\nsaving grace of moderation, had banded Europe against him: and the\r\nmost calculating of commanders had also given his enemies time to\r\nframe an effective military combination. The Prussian General von\r\nBoyen has told us in his Memoirs how dismayed ardent patriots were at\r\nthe conclusion of the armistice in June, and how slow even the wiser\r\nheads were to see that it would benefit their cause. If Napoleon\r\nneeded it in order to train his raw conscripts and organize new\r\nbrigades of cavalry, the need of the allies was even greater. Their\r\nresources were far less developed than his own. At Bautzen, their army\r\nwas much smaller; and Boyen states that had the Emperor pushed them\r\nhard, driven the Russians back into Poland and called the Poles once\r\nmore to arms, the allies must have been in the most serious\r\nstraits.[342]\r\n\r\nNapoleon, it is true, gained much by the armistice. His conscripts\r\nprofited immensely by the training of those nine weeks: his forces now\r\nthreatened Austria on the side of Bavaria and Illyria, as well as from\r\nthe newly intrenched camp south of Dresden: his cavalry was\r\nre-recovering its old efficiency: Murat, in answer to his imperious\r\nsummons, ended his long vacillations and joined the army at Dresden on\r\nAugust 14th.\r\n\r\nAbove all, the French now firmly held that great military barrier, the\r\nRiver Elbe. Napoleon's obstinacy during the armistice was undoubtedly\r\nfed by his boundless confidence in the strength of his military\r\nposition. In vain did his Marshals remind him that he was dangerously\r\nfar from France; that, if Austria drew the sword, she could cut him\r\noff from the Rhine, and that the Saale, or even the Rhine itself,\r\nwould be a safer line of defence.--Ten battles lost, he retorted,\r\nwould scarcely force him to that last step. True, he now exposed his\r\nline of communications with France; but if the art of war consisted in\r\nnever running any risk, glory would be the prize of mediocre minds. He\r\nmust have a complete triumph. The question was not of abandoning this\r\nor that province: his political superiority was at stake. At Marengo,\r\nAusterlitz, and Wagram, he was in greater danger. His forces now were\r\nnot _in the air_; they rested on the Elbe, on its fortresses, and on\r\nErfurt. Dresden was the pivot on which all his movements turned. His\r\nenemies were spread out on a circumference stretching from Prague to\r\nBerlin, while he was at the centre; and, operating on interior and\r\ntherefore shorter lines, he could outmarch and outmanoeuvre them.\r\n\"_But_,\" he concluded, \"_where I am not my lieutenants must wait for\r\nme without trusting anything to chance_. The allies cannot long act\r\ntogether on lines so extended, and can I not reasonably hope sooner or\r\nlater to catch them in some false move? If they venture between my\r\nfortified lines of the Elbe and the Rhine, I will enter Bohemia and\r\nthus take them in the rear.\"[343]\r\n\r\nThe plan promised much. The central intrenched camps of Dresden and\r\nPirna, together with the fortresses of Königstein above, and of Torgau\r\nbelow, the Saxon capital, gave great strategic advantages. The corps\r\nof St. Cyr at Königstein and those of Vandamme, Poniatowski, and\r\nVictor further to the east, watched the defiles leading from Bohemia.\r\nThe corps of Macdonald, Lauriston, Ney, and Marmont held in check\r\nBlücher's army of Silesia. On Napoleon's left, and resting on the\r\nfortresses of Wittenberg and Magdeburg, the corps of Oudinot,\r\nBertrand, and Reynier threatened Berlin and Bernadotte's army of the\r\nnorth cantonned in its neighbourhood; while Davoust at Hamburg faced\r\nBernadotte's northern detachments and menaced his communications with\r\nStralsund. Davoust certainly was far away, and the loss of this ablest\r\nof Napoleon's lieutenants was severely to be felt in the subsequent\r\ncomplicated moves; with this exception, however, Napoleon's troops\r\nwere well in hand and had the advantage of the central position, while\r\nthe allies were, as yet, spread out on an extended arc.\r\n\r\nBut Napoleon once more made the mistake of underrating both the\r\nnumbers and the abilities of his foes. By great exertions they now had\r\nclose on half a million of men under arms, near the banks of the Oder\r\nand the Elbe, or advancing from Poland and Hungary. True, many of\r\nthese were reserves or raw recruits, and Colonel Cathcart doubted\r\nwhether the Austrian reserves were then in existence.[344] But the\r\nbest authorities place the total at 496,000 men and 1,443 cannon.\r\nMoreover, as was agreed on at Trachenberg, 77,000 Russians and 49,000\r\nPrussians now marched from Glatz and Schweidnitz into Bohemia, and\r\nspeedily came into touch with the 110,000 Austrians now ranged behind\r\nthe River Eger. The formation of this allied Grand Army was a masterly\r\nstep. Napoleon did not hear of it before August 16th, and it was not\r\nuntil a week later that he realized how vast were the forces that\r\nwould threaten his rear. For the present his plan was to hold the\r\nBohemian passes south of Bautzen and Pirna, so as to hinder any\r\ninvasion of Saxony, while he threw himself in great force on the Army\r\nof Silesia, now 95,000 strong, though he believed it to number only\r\n50,000.[345] While he was crushing Blücher, his lieutenants, Oudinot,\r\nReynier, and Bertrand, were charged to drive Bernadotte's scattered\r\ncorps from Berlin; whereupon Davoust was to cut him off from the sea\r\nand relieve the French garrisons at Stettin and Küstrin. Thus Napoleon\r\nproposed to act on the offensive in the open country towards Berlin\r\nand in Silesia, remaining at first on the defensive at Dresden and in\r\nthe Lusatian mountains. This was against the advice of Marmont, who\r\nurged him to strike first at Prague, and not to intrust his\r\nlieutenants with great undertakings far away from Dresden. The advice\r\nproved to be sound; but it seems certain that Napoleon intended to\r\nopen the campaign by a mighty blow dealt at Blücher, and then to lead\r\na great force through the Lusatian defiles into Bohemia and drive the\r\nallies before him towards Vienna.\r\n\r\nBut what did he presume that the allied forces in Bohemia would be\r\ndoing while he overwhelmed Blücher in Silesia? Would not Dresden and\r\nhis communications with France be left open to their blows? He decided\r\nto run this risk. He had 100,000 men among the Lusatian hills between\r\nBautzen and Zittau. St. Cyr's corps was strongly posted at Pirna and\r\nthe small fortress of Königstein, while his light troops watched the\r\npasses north of Teplitz and Karlsbad. If the allies sought to invade\r\nSaxony, they would, so Napoleon thought, try to force the Zittau road,\r\nwhich presented few natural difficulties. If they threatened Dresden\r\nby the passages further west, Vandamme would march from near Zittau to\r\nreinforce St. Cyr, or, if need be, the Emperor himself would hurry\r\nback from Silesia with his Guards. If the enemy invaded Bavaria,\r\nNapoleon wished them _bon voyage_: they would soon come back faster\r\nthan they went; for, in that case, he would pour his columns down from\r\nZittau towards Prague and Vienna. The thought that he might for a time\r\nbe cut off from France troubled him not: \"400,000 men,\" he said,\r\n\"resting on a system of strongholds, on a river like the Elbe, are not\r\nto be turned.\" In truth, he thought little about the Bohemian army. If\r\n40,000 Russians had entered Bohemia, they would not reach Prague till\r\nthe 25th; so he wrote to St. Cyr On the 17th, the day when hostilities\r\ncould first begin; and he evidently believed that Dresden would be\r\nsafe till September. Its defence seemed assured by the skill of that\r\nmaster of defensive warfare, St. Cyr, by the barrier of the Erz\r\nMountains, and still more by Austrian slowness.\r\n\r\nOf this characteristic of theirs he cherished great hopes. Their\r\nfinances were in dire disorder; and Fouché, who had just returned from\r\na tour in the Hapsburg States, reported that the best way of striking\r\nat that Power would be \"to affect its paper currency, on which all its\r\narmaments depend.\"[346] And truly if the transport of a great army\r\nover a mountain range had depended solely on the almost bankrupt\r\nexchequer at Vienna, Dresden would have been safe until Michaelmas;\r\nbut, beside the material aid brought by the Russians and Prussians\r\ninto Bohemia, England also gave her financial support. In pursuance of\r\nthe secret article agreed on at Reichenbach, Cathcart now advanced\r\n£250,000 at once; and the knowledge that our financial support was\r\ngiven to the federative paper notes issued by the allies enabled the\r\nCourt of Vienna privately to raise loans and to wage war with a vigour\r\nwholly unexpected by Napoleon.[347]\r\n\r\nCertainly the allied Grand Army suffered from no lack of advisers. The\r\nCzar, the Emperor Francis, and the King of Prussia were there; as a\r\ncompliment to Austria, the command was intrusted to Field-Marshal\r\nSchwarzenberg, a man of diplomatic ability rather than of military\r\ngenius. By his side were the Russians, Wittgenstein, Barclay, and\r\nToll, the Prussian Knesebeck, the Swiss Jomini, and, above all,\r\nMoreau.\r\n\r\nThe last-named, as we have seen, came over on the inducement of\r\nBernadotte, and was received with great honour by the allied\r\nsovereigns. Jomini also was welcomed for his knowledge of the art of\r\nwar. This great writer had long served as a French general; but the\r\nill-treatment that he had lately suffered at Berthier's hands led him,\r\non August 14th, to quit the French service and pass over to the\r\nallies. His account of his desertion, however, makes it clear that he\r\nhad not penetrated Napoleon's designs, for the best of all reasons,\r\nbecause the Emperor kept them to himself to the very last moment.[348]\r\n\r\nThe second part of the campaign opens with the curious sight of\r\nimmense forces, commanded by experienced leaders, acting in complete\r\nignorance of the moves of the enemy only some fifty miles away.\r\nLeaving Bautzen on August 17th, Napoleon proceeded eastwards to\r\nGörlitz, turned off thence to Zittau, and hearing a false rumour that\r\nthe Russo-Prussian force in Bohemia was only 40,000 strong, returned\r\nto Görlitz with the aim of crushing Blücher. Disputes about the\r\narmistice had given that enterprising leader the excuse for entering\r\nthe neutral zone before its expiration; and he had had sharp affairs\r\nwith Macdonald and Ney near Löwenberg on the River Bober. Napoleon\r\nhurried up with his Guards, eager to catch Blücher;[349] the French\r\nwere now 140,000 strong, while the allies had barely 95,000 at hand.\r\nBut the Prussian veteran, usually as daring as a lion, was now wily as\r\na fox. Under cover of stiff outpost affairs, he skilfully withdrew to\r\nthe south-east, hoping to lure the French into the depths of Silesia\r\nand so give time to Schwarzenberg to seize Dresden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAMPAIGN OF 1813]\r\n\r\nBut Napoleon was not to be drawn further afield. Seeing that his foes\r\ncould not be forced to a pitched battle, he intrusted the command to\r\nMacdonald, and rapidly withdrew with Ney and his Guard towards\r\nGörlitz; for he now saw the possible danger to Dresden if\r\nSchwarzenberg struck home. If, however, that leader remained on the\r\ndefensive, the Emperor determined to fall back on what had all along\r\nbeen his second plan, and make a rush through the Lusatian defiles on\r\nPrague.[350] But a despatch from St. Cyr, which reached him at Görlitz\r\nlate at night on the 23rd, showed that Dresden was in serious danger\r\nfrom the gathering masses of the allies. This news consigned his\r\nsecond plan to the limbo of vain hopes. Yet, as will appear a little\r\nlater, his determination to defend by taking the offensive soon took\r\nform in yet a third design for the destruction of the allies.\r\n\r\nIt is a proof of the quenchless pugnacity of his mind that he framed\r\nthis plan during the fatigues of the long forced march back towards\r\nDresden, amidst pouring rain and the discouragement of knowing that\r\nhis raid into Silesia had ended merely in the fruitless wearying of\r\nhis choicest troops. Accompanied by the Old Guard, the Young Guard, a\r\ndivision of infantry, and Latour-Maubourg's cavalry, he arrived at\r\nStolpen, south-east of Dresden, before dawn of the 25th. Most of the\r\nbattalions had traversed forty miles in little more than forty-eight\r\nhours, and that, too, after a partial engagement at Löwenberg, and\r\ndespite lack of regular rations. Leaving him for a time, we turn to\r\nglance at the fortunes of the war in Brandenburg and Silesia.\r\n\r\nNapoleon had bidden Oudinot, with his own corps and those of Reynier\r\nand Bertrand, in all about 70,000 men, to fight his way to Berlin,\r\ndisperse the Landwehr and the \"mad rabble\" there, and, if the city\r\nresisted, set it in flames by the fire of fifty howitzers. That\r\nMarshal found that a tough resistance awaited him, although the allied\r\ncommander-in-chief, Bernadotte, moved with the utmost caution, as if\r\nhe were bent on justifying Napoleon's recent sneer that he would \"only\r\nmake a show\" (_piaffer_). It is true that the position of the Swedish\r\nPrince, with Davoust threatening his rear, was far from safe; but he\r\nearned the dislike of the Prussians by playing the _grand\r\nseigneur_.[351] Meanwhile most of the defence was carried out by the\r\nPrussians, who flooded the flat marshy land, thus delaying Oudinot's\r\nadvance and compelling him to divide his corps. Nevertheless, it\r\nseemed that Bernadotte was about to evacuate Berlin.\r\n\r\nAt this there was general indignation, which found vent in the retort\r\nof the Prussian General, von Bülow: \"Our bones shall bleach in front\r\nof Berlin, not behind it.\" Seeing an opportune moment while Oudinot's\r\nother corps were as yet far off, Bülow sharply attacked Reynier's\r\ncorps of Saxons at Grossbeeren, and gained a brilliant success, taking\r\n1,700 prisoners with 26 guns, and thus compelling Oudinot's scattered\r\narray to fall back in confusion on Wittenberg (August 23rd).[352]\r\nThither the Crown Prince cautiously followed him. Four days later, a\r\nPrussian column of Landwehr fought a desperate fight at Hagelberg with\r\nGirard's conscripts, finally rushing on them with wolf-like fury,\r\nstabbing and clubbing them, till the foss and the lanes of the town\r\nwere piled high with dead and wounded. Scarce 1,700 out of Girard's\r\n9,000 made good their flight to Magdeburg. The failures at Grossbeeren\r\nand Hagelberg reacted unfavourably on Davoust. That leader, advancing\r\ninto Mecklenburg, had skirmished with Walmoden's corps of Hanoverians,\r\nBritish, and Hanseatics; but, hearing of the failure of the other\r\nattempts on Berlin, he fell back and confined himself mainly to a\r\ndefensive which had never entered into the Emperor's designs on that\r\nside, or indeed on any side.\r\n\r\nEven when Napoleon left Macdonald facing Blücher in Silesia, his\r\norders were, not merely to keep the allies in check: if possible\r\nMacdonald was to attack him and drive him beyond the town of\r\nJauer.[353] This was what the French Marshal attempted to do on the\r\n26th of August. The conditions seemed favourable to a surprise.\r\nBlücher's army was stationed amidst hilly country deeply furrowed by\r\nthe valleys of the Katzbach and the \"raging Neisse.\"[354] Less than\r\nhalf of the allied army of 95,000 men was composed of Prussians: the\r\nRussians naturally obeyed his orders with some reluctance, and even\r\nhis own countryman, Yorck, grudgingly followed the behests of the\r\n\"hussar general.\"\r\n\r\nMacdonald also hoped to catch the allies while they were sundered by\r\nthe deep valley of the Neisse. The Prussians with the Russian corps\r\nled by Sacken were to the east of the Neisse near the village of\r\nEichholz, the central point of the plateau north of Jauer, which was\r\nthe objective of the French right wing; while Langeron's Russian corps\r\nwas at Hennersdorf, some three miles away and on the west of that\r\ntorrent. On his side, Blücher was planning an attack on Macdonald,\r\nwhen he heard that the French had crossed the Neisse near its\r\nconfluence with the Katzbach, and were struggling up the streaming\r\ngullies that led to Eichholz.\r\n\r\nDriving rain-storms hid the movements on both sides, and as Souham,\r\nwho led the French right, had neglected to throw out flanking scouts,\r\nthe Prussian staff-officer, Muffling, was able to ride within a short\r\ndistance of the enemy's columns and report to his chief that they\r\ncould be assailed before their masses were fully deployed on the\r\nplateau. While Souham's force was still toiling up, Sacken's artillery\r\nbegan to ply it with shot, and had Yorck charged quickly with his\r\ncorps of Prussians, the day might have been won forthwith. But that\r\nopinionated general insisted on leisurely deploying his men. Souham\r\nwas therefore able to gain a foothold on the plateau: Sebastiani's men\r\ndragged up twenty-four light cannon: and at times the devoted bravery\r\nof the French endangered the defence. But the defects in their\r\nposition slowly but surely told against them, and the vigour of their\r\nattack spent itself. Their cavalry was exhausted by the mud: their\r\nmuskets were rendered wellnigh useless by the ceaseless rain; and when\r\nBlücher late in the afternoon headed a dashing charge of Prussian and\r\nRussian horsemen, the wearied conscripts gave way, fled pell-mell down\r\nthe slopes, and made for the fords of the Neisse and the Katzbach,\r\nwhere many were engulfed by the swollen waters. Meanwhile the Russians\r\non the allied left barely kept off Lauriston's onsets, and on that\r\nside the day ended in a drawn fight. Macdonald, however, seeing\r\nLauriston's rear threatened by the advance of the Prussians over the\r\nKatzbach, retreated during the night with all his forces. On the next\r\nfew days, the allies, pressing on his wearied and demoralized troops,\r\ncompleted their discomfiture, so that Blücher, on the 1st of\r\nSeptember, was able thus to sum up the results of the battle and the\r\npursuit--two eagles, 103 cannon, 18,000 men, and a vast quantity of\r\nammunition and stores captured, and Silesia entirely freed from the\r\nfoe.[355]\r\n\r\nWe now return to the events that centred at Dresden. When, on August\r\n21st and 22nd, the allies wound their way through the passes of the\r\nErz, they were wholly ignorant of Napoleon's whereabouts. The\r\ngenerals, Jomini and Toll, who were acquainted with the plan of\r\noperations agree in stating that the aim of the allies was to seize\r\nLeipzig. The latter asserts that they believed Napoleon to be there,\r\nwhile the Swiss strategist saw in this movement merely a means of\r\neffecting a junction with Bernadotte's army, so as to cut off Napoleon\r\nfrom the Rhine.[356] Unaware that the rich prize of Dresden was left\r\nalmost within their grasp by Napoleon's eastward move, the allies\r\nplodded on towards Freiberg and Chemnitz, when, on the 23rd, the\r\ncapture of one of St. Cyr's despatches flashed the truth upon them.\r\n\r\nAt once they turned eastwards towards Dresden; but so slow was their\r\nprogress over the wretched cross-roads now cut up by the rains, that\r\nnot till the early morning of the 25th did the heads of their columns\r\nappear on the heights south-west of the Saxon capital. Yet, even so,\r\nthe omens were all in their favour. On their right, Wittgenstein had\r\nalready carried the French lines at Pirna, and was now driving in St.\r\nCyr's outposts towards Dresden. The daring spirits at Schwarzenberg's\r\nheadquarters therefore begged him to push on the advantage already\r\ngained, while Napoleon was still far away. Everything, they asserted,\r\nproved that the French were surprised; Dresden could not long hold out\r\nagainst an attack by superior numbers: its position in a river valley\r\ndominated by the southern and western slopes, which the allies\r\nstrongly held, was fatal to a prolonged defence: the thirteen redoubts\r\nhastily thrown up by the French could not long keep an army at bay,\r\nand of these only five were on the left side of the Elbe on which the\r\nallies were now encamped.\r\n\r\nAgainst these manly counsels the voice of prudence pleaded for delay.\r\nIt was not known how strong were St. Cyr's forces in Dresden and in\r\nthe intrenched camp south of the city. Would it not therefore be\r\nbetter to await the development of events? Such was the advice of Toll\r\nand Moreau, the latter warning the Czar, with an earnestness which we\r\nmay deem fraught with destiny for himself--\"Sire, if we attack, we\r\nshall lose 20,000 men and break our nose.\"[357] The multitude of\r\ncounsellors did not tend to safety. Distracted by the strife of\r\ntongues, Schwarzenberg finally took refuge in that last resort of weak\r\nminds, a tame compromise. He decided to wait until further corps\r\nreached the front, and at four o'clock of the following afternoon _to\r\npush forward five columns for a general reconnaissance in force_. As\r\nJomini has pointed out, this plan rested on sheer confusion of\r\nthought. If the commander meant merely to find out the strength of the\r\ndefenders, that could be ascertained at once by sending forward light\r\ntroops, screened by skirmishers, at the important points. If he wished\r\nto attack in force, his movement was timed too late in the day safely\r\nto effect a lodgment in a large city held by a resolute foe. Moreover,\r\nthe postponement of the attack for thirty hours gave time for the\r\nFrench Emperor to appear on the scene with his Guards.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, Napoleon reached Stolpen, a town distant some sixteen\r\nmiles from Dresden, very early on the morning of the 25th. His plans\r\npresent a telling contrast to the slow and clumsy arrangements of the\r\nallies. He proposed to hurl his Guards at their rear and cut them off\r\nfrom Bohemia. Crossing the Elbe at Königstein, he would recover the\r\ncamp of Pirna, hold the plateau further west and intercept\r\nSchwarzenberg's retreat.[358] For the success of this plan he needed a\r\nday's rest for his wearied Guards and the knowledge that Dresden could\r\nhold out for a short time. His veterans could perhaps dispense with\r\nrest; where their Emperor went they would follow; but Dresden was the\r\nunknown quantity. Shortly after midnight of the 25th and 26th, he\r\nheard from St. Cyr that Dresden would soon be attacked in such force\r\nthat a successful defence was doubtful.\r\n\r\nAt once he changed his plan and at 1 a.m. sent off four despatches\r\nordering his Guards and all available troops to succour St. Cyr.\r\nVandamme's corps alone was now charged with the task of creeping round\r\nthe enemy's rear, while the Guards long before dawn resumed their\r\nmarch through the rain and mud. The Emperor followed and passed them\r\nat a gallop, reaching the capital at 9 a.m. with Latour-Maubourg's\r\ncuirassiers; and, early in the afternoon, the bearskins of the Guards\r\nwere seen on the heights east of Dresden, while the dark masses of the\r\nallies were gathering on the south and west for their reconnaissance\r\nin force.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF DRESDEN]\r\n\r\nLowering clouds and pitiless rain robbed the scene of all brilliance,\r\nbut wreathed it with a certain sombre majesty. On the one side was the\r\nfair city, the centre of German art and culture, hastily girdled with\r\nredoubts and intrenchments manned now by some 120,000 defenders. Fears\r\nand murmurings had vanished as soon as the Emperor appeared; and\r\nthough in many homes men still longed for the triumph of the allies,\r\nyet loyalty to their King and awe of Napoleon held the great mass of\r\nthe citizens true to his alliance. As for the French soldiery, their\r\nenthusiasm was unbounded. As regiment after regiment tramped in\r\nwearily from the east over the Elbe bridge and the men saw that\r\nwell-known figure in the gray overcoat, fatigues and discomforts were\r\nforgotten; thunderous shouts of \"Vive l'Empereur\" rent the air and\r\nrolled along the stream, carrying inspiration to the defenders, doubt\r\nand dismay to the hostile lines. Yet these too were being\r\nstrengthened, until they finally mustered close on 200,000 men, who\r\ncrowned the slopes south of Dresden with a war-cloud that promised to\r\nsweep away its hasty defences--had not Napoleon been there.\r\n\r\nThe news of his arrival shook the nerves of the Russian Emperor, and\r\nit was reserved for the usually diffident King of Prussia to combat\r\nall notion of retreat. Schwarzenberg's reconnaissance in force\r\ntherefore took place punctually at four o'clock, when the French,\r\nafter a brief rest, were well prepared to meet them. The Prussians had\r\nalready seized the \"Great Garden\" which lines the Pirna road; and from\r\nthis point of vantage they now sought to drive St. Cyr from the works\r\nthrown up on its flank and rear. But their masses were torn by a\r\ndeadly fire and finally fell back shattered. The Russians, on their\r\nright, fared no better. At the allied centre and left, the attack at\r\none time promised success. Under cover of a heavy cannonade from their\r\nslopes, the Austrians carried two redoubts: but, with a desperate\r\ncharge, the Old Guard drove in through the gorges of these works and\r\nbayoneted the victors of an hour. As night fell, the assailants drew\r\noff baffled, after sustaining serious losses.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the miseries of the night, the heavy rains of the\r\ndawning day and the knowledge of the strength of the enemy's position\r\nin front and of Vandamme's movement in their rear, failed to daunt\r\ntheir spirits. If they were determined, Napoleon was radiant with\r\nhope. His force, though smaller, held the inner line and spread over\r\nsome three miles; while the concave front of the allies extended over\r\ndouble that space, and their left wing was separated from the centre\r\nby the stream and defile of Plauen. From his inner position he could\r\ntherefore readily throw an overpowering mass on any part of their\r\nattenuated array. He prepared to do so against their wings. At those\r\npoints everything promised success to his methods of attack.\r\n\r\nNever, perhaps, in all modern warfare has the musket been so useless\r\nas amidst the drenching rains which beat upon the fighters at the\r\nKatzbach and before Dresden. So defective was its firing arrangement\r\nthen that after a heavy storm only a feeble sputter came from whole\r\nbattalions of foot: and on those two eventful days the honours lay\r\nwith the artillery and _l'arme blanche_. As for the infantrymen, they\r\ncould effect little except in some wild snatches of bayonet work at\r\nclose quarters. This explains the course of events both at the\r\nKatzbach on the 26th, and at Dresden on the following day. The allied\r\ncentre was too strongly posted on the slopes south of Dresden to be\r\nassailed with much hope of success. But, against the Russian vanguard\r\non the allied right, Napoleon launched Mortier's corps and Nansouty's\r\ncavalry with complete success, until Wittgenstein's masses on the\r\nheights stayed the French onset. Along the centre, some thousand\r\ncannon thundered against one another, but with no very noteworthy\r\nresult, save that Moreau had his legs carried away by a shot from a\r\nfield battery that suddenly opened upon the Czar's suite. It was the\r\nfirst shot that dealt him this fatal wound, but several other balls\r\nfell among the group until Alexander and his staff moved away.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the great blow was struck by Napoleon at the allied left.\r\nThere the Austrian wing was sundered from the main force by the\r\ndifficult defile of Plauen; and it was crushed by one of the Emperor's\r\nmost brilliant combinations. Directing Victor with 20,000 men of all\r\narms to engage the white-coats in front, he bade Murat, with 10,000\r\nhorsemen, steal round near the bank of the Elbe and charge their flank\r\nand rear. The division of Count Metzko bore the brunt of this terrible\r\nonset. Nobly it resisted. Though not one musket in fifty would fire,\r\nthe footmen in one place beat off two charges of Latour-Maubourg's\r\ncuirassiers, until he headed his line with lancers, who mangled their\r\nranks and opened a way for the sword.[359] Then all was slaughter; and\r\nas Murat's squadrons raged along their broken lines, 10,000 footmen,\r\ncut off from the main body, laid down their arms. News of this\r\ndisaster on the left and the sound of Vandamme's cannon thundering\r\namong the hills west of Pirna decided the allied sovereigns and\r\nSchwarzenberg to prepare for a timely retreat into Bohemia. Yet so\r\nbold a front did they keep at the centre and right that the waning\r\nlight showed the combatants facing each other there on even terms.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, the rumbling of wagons warned Marmont's scouts that\r\nthe enemy were retreating;[360] and the Emperor, coming up at break of\r\nday, ordered that Marshal and St. Cyr to press directly on their rear,\r\nwhile Murat pursued the fugitives along the Freiburg road further to\r\nthe west. The outcome of these two days of fighting was most serious\r\nfor the allies. They lost 35,000 men in killed, wounded and\r\nprisoners--a natural result of their neglect to seize Fortune's\r\nbounteous favours on the 25th; a result, too, of Napoleon's rapid\r\nmovements and unerring sagacity in profiting by the tactical blunders\r\nof his foes.\r\n\r\nIt was the last of his great victories. And even here the golden fruit\r\nwhich he hoped to cull crumbled to bitter dust in his grasp. As has\r\nbeen pointed out, he had charged General Vandamme, one of the sternest\r\nfighters in the French army, to undertake with 38,000 men a task which\r\nhe himself had previously hoped to achieve with more than double that\r\nnumber. This was to seize Pirna and the plateau to the west, which\r\ncommands the three roads leading towards Teplitz in Bohemia. The best\r\nof these roads crosses the Erzgebirge by way of Nollendorf and the\r\ngorge leading down to Kulm, the other by the Zinnwald pass, while\r\nbetween them is a third and yet more difficult track. Vandamme was to\r\ntake up a position west or south-west of Pirna so as to cut off the\r\nretreat of the foe.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, he set out from Stolpen at dawn of the 26th, and on the\r\nnext two days fought his way far round the rear of the allied Grand\r\nArmy. A Russian force of 14,000 men, led by the young Prince Eugène of\r\nWürtemberg and Count Ostermann, sought in vain to stop his progress:\r\nthough roughly handled on the 28th by the French, the Muscovites\r\ndisengaged themselves, fell back ever fighting to the Nollendorf pass,\r\nand took up a strong position behind the village of Kulm. There they\r\nreceived timely support from the forces of the Czar and Frederick\r\nWilliam, who, after crossing by the Zinnwald pass, heard the firing on\r\nthe east and divined the gravity of the crisis. Unless they kept\r\nVandamme at bay, the Grand Army could with difficulty struggle through\r\ninto Bohemia. But now, with the supports hastily sent him, Ostermann\r\nfinally beat back Vandamme's utmost efforts. The defenders little knew\r\nwhat favours Fortune had in store.\r\n\r\nA Prussian corps under Kleist was slowly plodding up the middle of the\r\nthree defiles, when, at noonday of the 29th, an order came from the\r\nKing to hurry over the ridge and turn east to the support of\r\nOstermann. This was impossible: the defile was choked with wagons and\r\nartillery: but one of Kleist's staff-officers proposed the daring plan\r\nof plunging at once into cross tracks and cutting into Vandamme's\r\nrear. This novel and romantic design was carried out. While, then, the\r\nFrench general was showering his blows against the allies below Kulm,\r\nthe Prussians swarmed down from the heights of Nollendorf on his rear.\r\nEven so, the French struggled stoutly for liberty. Their leader,\r\nscorning death or surrender, flung himself with his braves on the\r\nRussians in front, but was borne down and caught, fighting to the\r\nlast. Several squadrons rushed up the steeps against the Prussians and\r\nin part hewed their way through. Four thousand footmen held their own\r\non a natural stronghold until their bullets failed, and the survivors\r\nsurrendered. Many more plunged into the woods and met various fates,\r\nsome escaping through to their comrades, others falling before\r\nKleist's rearguard. Such was the disaster of Kulm. Apart from the\r\nunbending heroism shown by the conquered, it may be called the Caudine\r\nForks of modern war. A force of close on 40,000 men was nearly\r\ndestroyed: it lost all its cannon and survived only in bands of\r\nexhausted stragglers.[361]\r\n\r\nWho is to be blamed for this disaster? Obviously, it could not have\r\noccurred had Vandamme kept in touch with the nearest French divisions:\r\notherwise, these could have closed in on Kleist's rear and captured\r\nhim. Napoleon clearly intended to support Vandamme by the corps of St.\r\nCyr, who, early on the 28th, was charged to co-operate with that\r\ngeneral, while Mortier covered Pirna. But on that same morning the\r\nEmperor rode to Pirna, found that St. Cyr, Marmont, and Murat were\r\nsweeping in crowds of prisoners, and directed Berthier to order\r\nVandamme to \"penetrate into Bohemia and overwhelm the Prince of\r\nWürtemberg.\"[362] Then, without waiting to organize the pursuit, he\r\nforthwith returned to Dresden, either because, as some say, the rains\r\nof the previous days had struck a chill to his system, or as Marmont,\r\nwith more reason, asserts, because of his concern at the news of\r\nMacdonald's disaster on the Katzbach. Certain it is that he recalled\r\nhis Old Guard to Dresden, busied himself with plans for a march on\r\nBerlin, and at 5.30 next morning directed Berthier to order St. Cyr to\r\n\"pursue the foe to Maxen and in all directions that he has taken.\"\r\nThis order led St. Cyr westwards, in pursuit of Barclay's Russians,\r\nwho had diverged sharply in that direction in order to escape\r\nVandamme.\r\n\r\nThe eastern road to Teplitz was thus left comparatively clear, while\r\nthe middle road was thronged with pursuers and pursued.[363] No\r\ndirections were given by Napoleon to warn Vandamme of the gap thus\r\nleft in his rear: neither was Mortier at Pirna told to press on and\r\nkeep in touch with Vandamme now that St. Cyr was some eight miles away\r\nto the west. Doubtless St. Cyr and Mortier ought to have concerted\r\nmeasures for keeping in touch with Vandamme, and they deserve censure\r\nfor their lack of foresight; but it was not usual, even for the\r\nMarshals, to take the initiative when the Emperor was near at hand. To\r\nsum up: the causes of Vandamme's disaster were, firstly, his rapid\r\nrush into Bohemia in quest of the Marshal's baton which was to be his\r\nguerdon of victory: secondly, the divergence of St. Cyr westward in\r\npursuance of Napoleon's order of the 29th to pursue the enemy towards\r\nMaxen: thirdly, the neglect of St. Cyr and Mortier to concert measures\r\nfor the support of Vandamme along the Nollendorf road: but, above all,\r\nthe return of Napoleon to Dresden, and his neglect to secure a timely\r\nco-operation of his forces along the eastern line of pursuit.[364]\r\n\r\nThe disaster at Kulm ruined Napoleon's campaign. While Vandamme was\r\nmaking his last stand, his master at Dresden was drawing up a long\r\nNote as to the respective advantages of a march on Berlin or on\r\nPrague. He decided on the former course, which would crush the\r\nnational movement in Prussia, and bring him into touch with Davoust\r\nand the French garrisons at Küstrin and Stettin. \"Then, if Austria\r\nbegins her follies again, I shall be at Dresden with a united army.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked on Austria as cowed by the blows dealt her south of Dresden,\r\nwhich would probably bring her to sue for peace, and he hoped that one\r\nmore great battle would end the war. The mishaps to Macdonald and\r\nVandamme dispelled these dreams. Still, with indomitable energy, he\r\ncharged Ney to take command of Oudinot's army (a post of which this\r\nunfortunate leader begged to be relieved) and to strike at Berlin. He\r\nordered Friant with a column of the Old Guard to march to Bautzen and\r\ndrive in Macdonald's stragglers with the butt ends of muskets.[365]\r\nThen, hearing how pressing was the danger of this Marshal, he himself\r\nset out secretly with the cavalry of the Guard in hope of crushing\r\nBlücher. But again that leader retreated (September 4th and 5th), and\r\nonce more the allied Grand Army thrust its columns through the Erz and\r\nthreatened Dresden. Hurrying back in the worst of humours to defend\r\nthat city, Napoleon heard bad news from the north. On September 6th\r\nNey had been badly beaten at Dennewitz. In truth, that brave fighter\r\nwas no tactician: his dispositions were worse than those of Oudinot,\r\nand the obstinate bravery of the Prussians, led by Bülow and\r\nTauenzien, wrested a victory from superior numbers. Night alone saved\r\nNey's army from complete dissolution: as it was, he lost some 9,000\r\nkilled and wounded, 15,000 prisoners along with eighty cannon, and\r\nfrankly summed up the situation thus to his master: \"I have been\r\ntotally beaten, and still do not know whether my army has\r\nreassembled.\"[366] Ultimately his army assembled and fell back behind\r\nthe Elbe at Torgau.\r\n\r\nThus, in a fortnight (August 23rd-September 6th), Napoleon had gained\r\na great success at Dresden, while, on the circumference of operations,\r\nhis lieutenants had lost five battles--Grossbeeren, Hagelberg,\r\nKatzbach, Kulm, and Dennewitz. The allies could therefore contract\r\nthat circumference, come into closer touch, and threaten his central\r\nintrenched camps at Pirna and Dresden. Yet still, in pursuance of a\r\npreconcerted plan, they drew back where he advanced in person. Thus,\r\nwhen he sought to drive back Schwarzenberg's columns into Bohemia,\r\nthat leader warily retired to the now impregnable passes; and the\r\nEmperor fell back on Dresden, wearied and perplexed. As he said to\r\nMarmont: \"The chess-board is very confused: it is only I who can know\r\nwhere I am.\" Yet once more he plunged into the Erzgebirge, engaged in\r\na fruitless skirmish in the defile above Kulm, and again had to lead\r\nhis troops back to Pirna and Dresden. A third move against Blücher led\r\nto the same wearisome result.\r\n\r\nThe allies, having worn down the foe, planned a daring move. Blücher\r\npersuaded the allied sovereigns to strike from Bohemia at Leipzig,\r\nthus turning the flank of the defensive works that the French had\r\nthrown up south of Dresden, and cutting their communications with\r\nFrance. He himself would march north-west, join the northern army, and\r\nthereafter meet them at Leipzig. This rendezvous he kept, as later he\r\nstaunchly kept troth with Wellington at Waterloo; and we may detect\r\nhere, as in 1815, the strategic genius of Gneisenau as the prime\r\nmotive force.\r\n\r\nLeaving a small force to screen his former positions at Bautzen, the\r\nveteran, with 65,000 men, stealthily set out on his flank march\r\ntowards Wittenberg, threw two pontoon bridges over the Elbe at\r\nWartenburg, about ten miles above that fortress, drove away Bertrand's\r\nbattalions who hindered the crossing, and threw up earthworks to\r\nprotect the bridges (October 3rd). This done, he began to feel about\r\nfor Bernadotte, and came into touch with him south of Dessau. By this\r\ndaring march he placed two armies, amounting to 160,000 men, on the\r\nnorth of Napoleon's lines; and his personal influence checked, even if\r\nit did not wholly stop, the diplomatic loiterings of the Swedish Crown\r\nPrince.[368] Bernadotte's hesitations were finally overcome by the\r\nnews that Blücher was marching south towards Leipzig. Finally he gave\r\norders to follow him; but we may judge how easy would have been the\r\ntask of overthrowing Bernadotte's discordant array if Napoleon could\r\nhave carried out his project of September 30th.\r\n\r\nAs it was, the disaster of Kulm kept the Emperor tethered for some\r\ndays within a few leagues of Dresden, while Bülow and Blücher saved\r\nthe campaign for the allies in the north, thereby exciting a patriotic\r\nferment which drove Jerome Bonaparte from Cassel and kept Davoust to\r\nthe defensive around Hamburg. There the skilful moves of Walmoden with\r\na force of Russians, British, Swedes, and North Germans kept in check\r\nthe ablest of the French Marshals, and prevented his junction with the\r\nEmperor, for which the latter never ceased to struggle.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Grand Army of the allies, strengthened by the approach\r\nfrom Poland of 50,000 Russians of the Army of Reserve, was creeping\r\nthrough the western passes of the Erz into the plains south of\r\nLeipzig. This move was not unexpected by Napoleon. The importance of\r\nthat city was obvious. Situated in the midst of the fertile Saxon\r\nplain, the centre of a great system ofroads, its position and its\r\nwealth alike marked it out as the place likely to be seized by a\r\ndaring foe who should seek to cut Napoleon off from France.\r\n\r\nAs fortune turned against him, he became ever more nervous about\r\nLeipzig. Yet, for the present, the northward march of Blücher rivetted\r\nhis attention. It puzzled him. Even as late as October 2nd he had not\r\nfathomed Blücher's real aim[369]. But four days later he heard that\r\nthe Prussian leader had crossed the Elbe. At once he hurried\r\nnorth-west with the Guard to crush him, and to resume the favourite\r\nproject of threatening Berlin and join hands with Davoust. Charging\r\nSt-Cyr with the defence of Dresden, and Murat with the defence of\r\nLeipzig, he took his stand at Düben, a small town on the Mulde, nearly\r\nmidway between Leipzig and Wittenberg. Thence he reinforced Ney's\r\narmy, and ordered that Marshal northwards to fall on the rear of\r\nBernadotte and Blücher; while he himself waited in a moated castle at\r\nDüben to learn the issue of events.\r\n\r\nThe saxon Colonel, von Odeleben, has left us a vivid picture of the\r\ngreat man's restlessness during those four days. Surrounded by maps\r\nand despatches, and waited on by watchful geographer and apprehensive\r\nsecretary, he spent much of the time scrawling large letters on a\r\nsheet of paper, uneasily listening for the tramp of a courier. In\r\ntruth, few days of his life were more critical that those spent amidst\r\nthe rains, swamps, and fogs of Düben. Could he have caught Bernadotte\r\nand Blücher far apart, he might have overwhelmed them singly, and then\r\nhave carried the war into the heart of Prussia. But he knows that\r\nDresden and Leipzig are far from safe. The news from that side begins\r\nto alarm him: and though, on the north, Ney, Bertrand, and Reynier cut\r\nup the rearguard of the allies, he learns with some disquiet that\r\nBlücher is withdrawing westwards behind the River Saale, a move which\r\nbetokens a wish to come into touch with Schwarzenberg near Leipzig.\r\n\r\nYet this disconcerting thought spurs him on to one of his most daring\r\ndesigns. \"As a means of upsetting all their plans, I will march to the\r\nElbe. There I have the advantage, since I have Hamburg, Magdeburg,\r\nWittenberg, Torgau, and Dresden.\"[370] What faith he had in the\r\ndefensive capacities of a great river line dotted with fortresses! His\r\nlieutenants did not share it. Caulaincourt tells us that his plan of\r\ndashing at Berlin roused general consternation at headquarters, and\r\nthat the staff came in a body to beg him to give it up, and march back\r\nto protect Leipzig. Reluctantly he abandons it, and then only to\r\nchange it for one equally venturesome. He will crush Bernadotte and\r\nBlücher, or throw them beyond the Elbe, and then, himself crossing the\r\nElbe, ascend its right bank, recross it at Torgau, and strike at\r\nSchwarzenberg's rear near Leipzig.\r\n\r\nThe plan promised well, provided that his men were walking machines,\r\nand that Schwarzenberg did nothing in the interval. But gradually the\r\ntruth dawns on him that, while he sits weaving plans and dictating\r\ndespatches--he sent off six in the small hours of October\r\n12th--Blücher and Schwarzenberg are drawing near to Leipzig. On that\r\nday he prepared to fall back on that city, a resolve strengthened on\r\nthe morrow by the capture of one of the enemy's envoys, who reported\r\nthat they had great hopes of detaching Bavaria from the French cause.\r\n\r\nThe news was correct. Five days earlier, the King of Bavaria had come\r\nto terms with Austria, offering to place 36,000 troops at her\r\ndisposal, while she, in return, guaranteed his complete sovereignty\r\nand a full territorial indemnity for any districts that he might be\r\ncalled on to restore to the Hapsburgs.[371] Napoleon knew not as yet\r\nthe full import of the news, and it is quite incorrect to allege, as\r\nsome heedless admirers have done, that this was the only thing that\r\nstayed his conquering march northwards.[372] His retreat to Leipzig\r\nwas arranged before he heard the first rumour as to Bavaria's\r\ndefection. But the tidings saddened his men on their miry march\r\nsouthwards; and, strange to say, the Emperor published it to all his\r\ntroops at Leipzig on the 15th, giving it as the cause why they were\r\nabout to fall back on the Rhine.\r\n\r\nThere was much to depress the Emperor when, on the 14th, he drew near\r\nto Leipzig. With him came the King and Queen of Saxony, who during the\r\nlast days had resignedly moved along in the tail of this comet, which\r\nhad blasted their once smiling realm. Outside the city they parted,\r\nthe royal pair seeking shelter under its roofs, while the Emperor\r\npressed on to Murat's headquarters near Wachau. There, too the news\r\nwas doubtful. The King of Naples had not, on that day, shown his old\r\nprowess. Though he disposed of larger masses of horsemen than those\r\nwhich the allies sent out to reconnoitre, he chose his ground of\r\nattack badly, and led his brigades in so loose an array that, after\r\nlong swayings to and fro, the fight closed with advantage to the\r\nallies.[373] It was not without reason that Napoleon on that night\r\nreceived his Marshals rather coolly at his modest quarters in the\r\nvillage of Reudnitz. Leaning against the stove, he ran over several\r\nnames of those who were now slack in their duty; and when Augereau was\r\nannounced, he remarked that he was not the Augereau of Castiglione.\r\n\"Ah! give me back the old soldiers of Italy, and I will show you that\r\nI am,\" retorted the testy veteran.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Napoleon was not the old Napoleon, not even the\r\nNapoleon of Dresden. There he had overwhelmed the foe by a rapid\r\nconcentration. Now nothing decisive was done on the 15th, and time was\r\nthereby given the allies to mature their plans. Early on that day\r\nBlücher heard that on the morrow Schwarzenberg would attack Leipzig\r\nfrom the south-east, but would send a corps westwards to threaten it\r\non the side of Lindenau. The Prussian leader therefore hurried on from\r\nthe banks of the Saale, and at night the glare of his watch-fires\r\nwarned Marmont that Leipzig would be assailed also from the\r\nnorth-west. Yet, despite the warnings which Napoleon received from his\r\nMarshal, he refused to believe that the north side was seriously\r\nthreatened; and, as late as the dawn of the 16th, he bade his troops\r\nthere to be ready to march through Leipzig and throw themselves on the\r\nmasses of Schwarzenberg.[374] Had Napoleon given those orders on the\r\n15th, all might have gone well; for all his available forces, except\r\nNey's and Reynier's corps, were near at hand, making a total of nearly\r\n150,000 men, while Schwarzenberg had as yet not many more. But those\r\norders on the 16th were not only belated: they contributed to the\r\ndefeat on the north side.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's thoughts were concentrated on the south. There his lines\r\nstretched in convex front along undulating ground near Wachau and\r\nLiebertwolkwitz, about a league to the south and south-east of the\r\ntown. His right was protected by the marshy ground of the small river\r\nPleisse; his centre stretched across the roads leading towards\r\nDresden, while his left rested on a small stream, the Parthe, which\r\ncurves round towards the north-west and forms a natural defence to the\r\ntown on the north. Yet to cautious minds his position seemed unsafe;\r\nhe had in his rear a town whose old walls were of no military value, a\r\ntown on which several roads converged from the north, east, and south,\r\nbut from which, in case of defeat, he could retire westward only by\r\none road, that leading over the now flooded streams of the Pleisse and\r\nthe Elster. But the great captain himself thought only of victory. He\r\nhad charged Macdonald and Ney to march from Taucha to his support:\r\nMarmont was to do the same; and, with these concentrated forces acting\r\nagainst the far more extended array of Schwarzenberg, he counted on\r\noverthrowing him on the morrow, and then crushing the disunited forces\r\nof Blücher and Bernadotte.[375]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF LEIPZIG]\r\n\r\nThe Emperor and Murat were riding along the ridge near\r\nLiebertwolkwitz, when, at nine o'clock, three shots fired in quick\r\nsuccession from the allies on the opposite heights, opened the series\r\nof battles fitly termed the Battle of the Nations. For six hours a\r\nfurious cannonade shook the earth, and the conflict surged to and fro\r\nwith little decisive result; but when Macdonald's corps struck in from\r\nthe north-east, the allies began to give ground. Thereupon Napoleon\r\nlaunched two cavalry corps, those of Latour-Maubourg and Pajol,\r\nagainst the allied centre.\r\n\r\nThen was seen one of the most superb sights of war. Rising quickly\r\nfrom behind the ridge, 12,000 horsemen rode in two vast masses against\r\na weak point in the opposing lines. They were led by the King of\r\nNaples with all his wonted dash. Panting up the muddy slopes opposite,\r\nthey sabred the gunners, enveloped the Russian squares, and the three\r\nallied sovereigns themselves had to beat a hasty retreat to avoid\r\ncapture. But the horses were soon spent by the furious pace at which\r\nMurat careered along; and a timely charge by Pahlen's Cossacks and the\r\nSilesian cuirassiers, brought up from the allied reserves beyond the\r\nPleisse, drove the French brigades back in great disorder, with the\r\nloss of their able corps leaders. The allies by a final effort\r\nregained all the lost ground, and the day here ended in a drawn fight,\r\nwith the loss of about 20,000 men to either side.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the west side of Leipzig, Bertrand had beaten off the\r\nattack of Giulay's Austrian corps on the village of Lindenau. But,\r\nfurther north, Marmont sustained a serious reverse. In obedience to\r\nNapoleon's order, he was falling back towards Leipzig, when he was\r\nsharply attacked by Yorck's corps at Möckern. Between that village and\r\nEutritzsch further east the French Marshal offered a most obstinate\r\nresistance. Blücher, hoping to capture his whole corps, begged Sir\r\nCharles Stewart to ride back to Bernadotte and request his succour.\r\nThe British envoy found the Swedish Prince at Halle and conjured him\r\nto make every exertion not to be the only leader left out of the\r\nbattle.[376] It was in vain: his army was too far away; and only after\r\nthe village of Möckern had been repeatedly taken and re-taken, was\r\nMarmont finally driven out by Yorck's Prussians.[377]\r\n\r\nIn truth, Marmont lacked the support of Ney's corps, which Berthier\r\nhad led him to expect if he were attacked in force. But the orders\r\nwere vague or contradictory. Ney had been charged to follow Macdonald\r\nand impart irresistible momentum to the onset which was to have\r\ncrushed Schwarzenberg's right wing. He therefore only detached one\r\nweak division to cover Marmont's right flank, and with the other\r\ndivisions marched away south, when an urgent message from Möckern\r\nrecalled him to that side of Leipzig, with the result that his 15,000\r\nmen spent the whole day in useless marches and counter-marches.[378]\r\nThe mishap was most serious. Had he strengthened Macdonald's\r\noutflanking move, the right wing of the allied Grand Army might have\r\nbeen shattered. Had he reinforced Marmont effectively, the position on\r\nthe north might have been held. As it was, the French fell back from\r\nMöckern in confusion, losing 53 cannon; but they had inflicted on\r\nYorck's corps a loss of 8,000 men out of 21,000. Relatively to the\r\nforces engaged, Albuera and Möckern are the bloodiest battles of the\r\nNapoleonic wars.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Napoleon had dealt the allies heavier losses than he had\r\nsustained. But they could replace them. On the morrow Bennigsen was\r\nnear at hand on the east with 41,000 Russians of the Army of Reserve;\r\nColloredo's Austrian corps had also come up; and, in the north,\r\nBernadotte's Army of the North, 60,000 strong, was known to be\r\nmarching from Halle to reinforce Blücher. Napoleon, however, could\r\nonly count on Reynier's corps of 15,000 men, mostly Saxons, who\r\nmarched in from Düben. St. Cyr's corps of 27,000 men was too far away,\r\nat Dresden; and Napoleon must have bitterly rued his rashness in\r\nleaving that Marshal isolated on the south-east, while Davoust was\r\nalso cut off at Hamburg. He now had scarcely 150,000 effectives left\r\nafter the slaughter of the 16th; and of these, the German divisions\r\nwere murmuring at the endless marches and privations. Everything\r\nhelped to depress men's minds. On that Sabbath morning all was sombre\r\ndesolation around Leipzig, while within that city naught was heard but\r\nthe groans of the wounded and the lamentations of the citizens. Still\r\nNapoleon's spirit was unquenched. Amidst the steady rain he paced\r\nrestlessly with Murat along the dykes of the Pleisse. The King assured\r\nhim that the enemy had suffered enormous losses. Then, the dreary walk\r\nended, the Emperor shut himself in his tent. His resolve was taken. He\r\nwould try fortune once more.[379]\r\n\r\nAmong the prisoners was the Austrian General Merveldt, over whom\r\nNapoleon had gained his first diplomatic triumph, that at Leoben. He\r\nit was, too, who had brought the first offers of an armistice after\r\nAusterlitz. These recollections touched the superstitious chords in\r\nthe great Corsican's being; for in times of stress the strongest\r\nnature harks back to early instincts. This harbinger of good fortune\r\nthe Emperor now summoned and talked long and earnestly with him.[380]\r\nFirst, he complimented him on his efforts of the previous day to turn\r\nthe French left at Dölitz; next, he offered to free him on parole in\r\norder to return to the allied headquarters with proposals for an\r\narmistice. Then, after giving out that he had more than 200,000 men\r\nround Leipzig, he turned to the European situation. Why had Austria\r\ndeserted him? At Prague she might have dictated terms to Europe. But\r\nthe English did not want peace. To this Merveldt answered that they\r\nneeded it sorely, but it must be not a truce, but a peace founded on\r\nthe equilibrium of Europe.--\"Well,\" replied Napoleon, \"let them give\r\nme back my isles and I will give them back Hanover; I will also\r\nre-establish the Hanse Towns and the annexed departments [of North\r\nGermany].... But how treat with England, who wishes to bind me not to\r\nbuild more than thirty ships of the line in my ports?\"[381]\r\n\r\nAs for the Confederation of the Rhine, those States might secede that\r\nchose to do so: but never would he cease to protect those that wanted\r\nhis protection. As to giving Holland its independence, he saw a great\r\ndifficulty: that land would then fall under the control of England.\r\nItaly ought to be under one sovereign; that would suit the European\r\nsystem. As he had abandoned Spain, that question was thereby decided.\r\nWhy then should not peace be the result of an armistice?--The allied\r\nsovereigns thought differently, and at once waved aside the proposal.\r\nNo answer was sent.\r\n\r\nIn fact, they had Napoleon in their power, as he surmised. Late on\r\nthat Sunday, he withdrew his drenched and half-starved troops nearer\r\nto Leipzig; for Blücher had gained ground on the north and threatened\r\nthe French line of retreat. Why the Emperor did not retreat during the\r\nnight must remain a mystery. All the peoples of Europe were now\r\nclosing in on him. On the north were Prussians, Russians, Swedes, and\r\na few British troops. To the south-east were the dense masses of the\r\nallied Grand Army drawn from all the lands between the Alps and the\r\nUrals; and among Bennigsen's array on the east of Leipzig were to be\r\nseen the Bashkirs of Siberia, whose bows and arrows gained them from\r\nthe French soldiery the sobriquet of _les Amours_.\r\n\r\nTo this ring of 300,000 fighters Napoleon could oppose scarcely half\r\nas many. Yet the French fought on, if not for victory, yet for honour;\r\nand, under the lead of Prince Poniatowski, whose valour on the 16th\r\nhad gained him the coveted rank of a Marshal of France, the Poles once\r\nmore clutched desperately at the wraith of their national\r\nindependence. Napoleon took his stand with his staff on a hill behind\r\nProbstheyde near a half-ruined windmill, fit emblem of his fortunes;\r\nwhile, further south, the three allied monarchs watched from a higher\r\neminence the vast horse-shoe of smoke slowly draw in towards the city.\r\nIn truth, this immense conflict baffles all description. On the\r\nnorth-east, the Crown Prince of Sweden gradually drove his columns\r\nacross the Parthe, while Blücher hammered at the suburbs.\r\n\r\nNear the village of Paunsdorf, the allies found a weak place in the\r\ndefence, where Reynier's Saxons showed signs of disaffection. Some few\r\nwent over to the Russians in the forenoon, and about 3 p.m. others\r\nmarched over with loud hurrahs. They did not exceed 3,000 men, with 19\r\ncannon, but these pieces were at once effectively used against the\r\nFrench. Napoleon hurried towards the spot with part of his Guards, who\r\nrestored the fight on that side. But it was only for a time. The\r\ndefence was everywhere overmatched.\r\n\r\nEven the inspiration of his presence and the desperate efforts of\r\nMurat, Poniatowski, Victor, Macdonald, and thousands of nameless\r\nheroes, barely held off the masses of the allied Grand Army. On the\r\nnorth and north-east, Marmont and Ney were equally overborne.[382]\r\nWorst of all, the supply of cannon balls was running low. With\r\npardonable exaggeration the Emperor afterwards wrote to Clarke: \"If I\r\nhad then had 30,000 rounds, I should to-day be the master of the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nAt nightfall, the chief returned weary and depressed to the windmill,\r\nand instructed Berthier to order the retreat. Then, beside a\r\nwatch-fire, he sank down on a bench into a deep slumber, while his\r\ngenerals looked on in mournful silence. All around them there surged\r\nin the darkness the last cries of battle, the groans of the wounded,\r\nand the dull rumble of a retreating host. After a quarter of an hour\r\nhe awoke with a start and threw an astonished look on his staff; then,\r\nrecollecting himself, he bade an officer repair to the King of Saxony\r\nand tell him the state of affairs.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning, he withdrew into Leipzig, and, after paying a\r\nbrief visit to the King, rode away towards the western gate. It was\r\nnone too soon. The conflux of his still mighty forces streaming in by\r\nthree high roads, produced in all the streets of the town a crush\r\nwhich thickened every hour. The Prussians and Swedes were breaking\r\ninto the northern suburbs, while the white-coats drove in the\r\ndefenders on the south. Slowly and painfully the throng of fugitives\r\nstruggled through the town towards the western gate. On that side the\r\nconfusion became ever worse, as the shots of the allies began to whiz\r\nacross the arches and causeway that led over the Pleisse and the\r\nElster, while the hurrahs of the Russians drew near on the north.\r\nAmmunition wagons, gendarmes, women, grenadiers and artillery, cavalry\r\nand cattle, the wounded, the dying, Marshals and sutlers, all were\r\nwedged into an indistinguishable throng that fought for a foothold on\r\nthat narrow road of safety; and high above the din came the clash of\r\nmerry bells from the liberated suburbs, bells that three days before\r\nhad rung forced peals of triumph at Napoleon's orders, but now bade\r\nfarewell for ever to French domination. To increase the rout, a\r\ntemporary bridge thrown over the Elster broke down under the crush;\r\nand the rush for the roadway became more furious. In despair of\r\nreaching it, hundreds threw themselves into the flooded stream, but\r\nfew reached the further shore: among the drowned was that flower of\r\nPolish chivalry, Prince Poniatowski.\r\n\r\nBut this mishap was soon to be outdone. A corporal of engineers, in\r\nthe absence of his chief, had received orders to blow up the bridge\r\noutside the western gate, as soon as the pursuers were at hand; but,\r\nalarmed by the volleys of Sacken's Russians, whom Blücher had sent to\r\nwork round by the river courses north-west of the town, the bewildered\r\nsubaltern fired the mine while the rearguard and a great crowd of\r\nstragglers were still on the eastern side.[383] This was the climax of\r\nthis day of disaster, which left in the hands of the allies as many as\r\nthirty generals, including Lauriston and Reynier, and 33,000 of the\r\nrank and file, along with 260 cannon and 870 ammunition wagons. From\r\nthe village of Lindenau Napoleon gazed back at times over the awesome\r\nscene, but in general he busied himself with reducing to order the\r\nmasses that had struggled across. The Old Guard survived, staunch as\r\never, and had saved its 120 cannon, but the Young Guard was reduced to\r\na mere wreck. Amidst all the horrors of that day, the Emperor\r\nmaintained a stolid composure, but observers saw that he was bathed in\r\nsweat. Towards evening, he turned and rode away westwards; and from\r\nthe weary famished files, many a fierce glance and muttered curse shot\r\nforth as he passed by. Men remembered that it was exactly a year since\r\nthe Grand Army broke up from Moscow.\r\n\r\nYet, despite the ravages of typhus, the falling away of the German\r\nStates and the assaults of the allied horse, the retreating host\r\nstruggled stoutly on towards the Rhine. At Hainau it swept aside an\r\narmy of Bavarians and Austrians that sought to bar the road to France;\r\nand, early in November, 40,000 armed men, with a larger number of\r\nunarmed stragglers, filed across the bridge at Mainz. Napoleon had not\r\nonly lost Germany; he left behind in its fortresses as many as 190,000\r\ntroops, of whom nearly all were French; and of the 1,300 cannon with\r\nwhich he began the second part of the campaign, scarce 200 were now at\r\nhand for the defence of his Empire.\r\n\r\nThe causes of this immense disaster are not far to seek. They were\r\nboth political and military. In staking all on the possession of the\r\nline of the Elbe, Napoleon was engulfing himself in a hostile land. At\r\nthe first signs of his overthrow, the national spirit of Germany was\r\ncertain to inflame the Franconians and Westphalians in his rear, and\r\nimperil his communications. In regard to strategy, he committed the\r\nsame blunder as that perpetrated by Mack in 1805. He trusted to a\r\nriver line that could easily be turned by his foes. As soon as Austria\r\ndeclared against him, his position on the Elbe was fully as perilous\r\nas Mack's lines of the Iller at Ulm.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in spite of the obvious danger from the great mountain\r\nbastion of Bohemia that stretched far away in his rear, the Emperor\r\nkept his troops spread out from Königstein to Hamburg, and ventured on\r\nlong and wearying marches into Silesia, and north to Düben, which left\r\nhis positions in Saxony almost at the mercy of the allied Grand\r\nArmy.[384] By emerging from the mighty barrier of the Erzgebirge, that\r\narmy compelled him three times to give up his offensive moves and\r\nhastily to fall back into the heart of Saxony.\r\n\r\nThe plain truth is that he was out-generalled by the allies. The\r\nassertion may seem to savour of profanity. Yet, if words have any\r\nmeaning, the phrase is literally correct. His aim was primarily to\r\nmaintain himself on the line of the Elbe, but also, though in the\r\nsecond place, to keep up his communication with France. Their aim was\r\nto leave him the Elbe line, but to cut him off from France. Even at\r\nthe outset they planned to strike at Leipzig: their attack on Dresden\r\nwas an afterthought, timidly and slowly carried out. As long, however,\r\nas their Grand Army clung to the Erz mountains, they paralyzed his\r\nmovements to the east and north, which merely played into their hands.\r\n\r\nAs regards the execution of the allied plans, the honours must\r\nunquestionably rest with Blücher and Gneisenau. Their tactful retreats\r\nbefore Napoleon in Silesia, their crushing blow at Macdonald, above\r\nall, their daring flank march to Wartenburg and thence to Halle, are\r\nexploits of a very high order; and doubtless it was the emergence of\r\nthis unsuspected volcanic force from the unbroken flats of continental\r\nmediocrity that nonplussed Napoleon and led to the results described\r\nabove. Truly heroic was Blücher's determination to push on to Leipzig,\r\neven when the enemy was seizing the Elbe bridges in his rear. The\r\nveteran saw clearly that a junction with Schwarzenberg near Leipzig\r\nwas the all-important step, and that it must bring back the French to\r\nthat point. His judgment was as sound as his strokes were trenchant;\r\nand, owing to the illusions which Napoleon still cherished as to the\r\nsaving strength of the Elbe line, the French arrived on that mighty\r\nbattlefield half-famished and wearied by fruitless marches and\r\ncountermarches. Of all Napoleon's campaigns, that of the second part\r\nof 1813 must rank as by far the weakest in conception, the most\r\nfertile in blunders, and the most disastrous in its results for\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION.--In order not to overcrowd these chapters\r\nwith diplomatic details, I have made only the briefest reference to\r\nthe Treaties signed at Teplitz on Sept. 9th, 1813, with Russia and\r\nPrussia, which cemented the fourth great Coalition; but it will be\r\nwell to describe them here.\r\n\r\nA way having been paved for a closer union by the Treaty of Kalisch\r\n(see p. 276) and by that of Reichenbach (see p. 317), it was now\r\nagreed (1) that Austria and Prussia should be restored as nearly as\r\npossible to the position which they held in 1805; (2) that the\r\nConfederation of the Rhine should be dissolved; (3) and that \"full and\r\nunconditional independence\" should be accorded to the princes of the\r\nother German States. This last clause was firmly but vainly opposed by\r\nStein and the German Unionist party. Austria's help was so sorely\r\nneeded that she could dictate her terms, and she began to scheme for\r\nthe creation of a sort of _Fürstenbund_, or League of Princes, under\r\nher hegemony. The result was seen in her Treaty of October 7th, 1813,\r\nwith Bavaria, which detached that State from the French alliance and\r\nassured the success of Metternich's plans for Germany (see pp.\r\n354-355). The smaller States soon followed the lead given by Bavaria;\r\nand the reconstruction of Germany on the Austrian plan was further\r\nassured by the Treaty of Chaumont (see pp. 402-403). Thus the dire\r\nneed of Austrian help felt by Russia and Prussia throughout the\r\ncampaigns of 1813-1814 had no small share in moulding the future of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nFROM THE RHINE TO THE SEINE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Emperor Napoleon must become King of France. Up to now all his\r\nwork has been done for the Empire. He lost the Empire when he lost his\r\narmy. When he no longer makes war for the army, he will make peace for\r\nthe French people, and then he will become King of France.\"--Such were\r\nthe words of the most sagacious of French statesmen to Schwarzenberg.\r\nThey were spoken on April 15th, 1813, when it still seemed likely that\r\nNapoleon would meet halfway the wishes of Austria. Such, at least, was\r\nTalleyrand's ardent hope. He saw the innate absurdity of attempting to\r\nbrowbeat Austria, and strangle the infant Hercules of German\r\nnationality, after the Grand Army had been lost in Russia.\r\n\r\nIf this was reasonable in the spring of 1813, it was an imperative\r\nnecessity at the close of the year. Napoleon had in the meantime lost\r\n400,000 men: and he could not now say, as he did to Metternich of his\r\nlosses in Russia, that \"nearly half were Germans.\" The men who had\r\nfallen in Saxony, or who bravely held out in the Polish, German, and\r\nSpanish fortresses, were nearly all French. They were, what the\r\n_triarii_ were to the Roman legion, the reserves of the fighting\r\nmanhood of France. That unhappy land was growing restless under its\r\ndisasters. In Spain, Wellington had blockaded Pamplona, stormed St.\r\nSebastian, thrown Soult back on the Pyrenees in a series of desperate\r\nconflicts, and planted the British flag on the soil of France, eleven\r\ndays before Napoleon was overthrown at Leipzig. Then, pressing\r\nnorthwards, in compliance with the urgent appeals of the allied\r\nsovereigns, our great commander assailed the lines south of the\r\nNivelle, on which the French had been working for three months, drove\r\nthe enemy out of them and back over the river, with a loss of 4,200\r\nmen and 51 guns (November 10th).[385]\r\n\r\nThe same tale was told in the north. The allies were welcomed by the\r\nsecondary German princes, who, in return for compacts guaranteeing\r\ntheir sovereignty, promised to raise contingents that amounted in all\r\nto upwards of a quarter of a million of men. Bernadotte marched\r\nagainst the Danes and cut off Davoust in Hamburg, where that Marshal\r\nbravely held out to the end of the war. Elsewhere in the north\r\nNapoleon's domination quickly mouldered away. Bülow, aided by a small\r\nBritish force, invaded Holland early in November; and, with the old\r\ncry of _Orange boven_, the Dutch tore down the French tricolour and\r\nwelcomed back the Prince of Orange. In Italy, Eugène remained faithful\r\nto his step-father and repulsed all the overtures of the allies: but\r\nMurat, whose allegiance had already been shaken by the secret offers\r\nof the allies, now began to show signs of going over to them, as he\r\ndid at the dawn of the New Year.[386]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Napoleon had arrived at Paris (November 9th). He found his\r\ncapital sunk in depression, and indignant at the author of its\r\nmiseries. Peace was the dearest wish of all. Marie Louise confessed it\r\nby her tears, Cambacérès by his tactful reserve, and the people by\r\ntheir cries, while the sullen demeanour or bitter words of the\r\nMarshals showed that their patience was exhausted. Evidently a\r\nscapegoat was needed: it was found in the person of Maret, Duc de\r\nBassano, whose devotion to Napoleon had reduced the Ministry of\r\nForeign Affairs to a highly paid clerkship. For the crime of not\r\nbending his master's inflexible will at Dresden, he was now cast as a\r\nsop to the peace party; and his portfolio was intrusted to\r\nCaulaincourt, Duc de Vicenza (November 20th). The change was salutary.\r\nThe new Minister, when ambassador at St. Petersburg, had been highly\r\nesteemed by the Czar for his frank, chivalrous demeanour. Our\r\ncountrywoman, Lady Burghersh, afterwards testified to his personal\r\ncharm: \"I never saw a countenance so expressive of kindness,\r\nsweetness, and openness.\"[387] And these gifts were fortified by a\r\nmanly intelligence, a profound love of France, and by devotion to her\r\nhighest interests. The first of her interests was obviously peace; and\r\nthere now seemed some chance of his conferring this boon on her and on\r\nthe world at large.\r\n\r\nOn November the 8th and 9th Metternich had two interviews at Frankfurt\r\nwith Baron St. Aignan, a brother-in-law of Caulaincourt, and formerly\r\nthe French envoy at Weimar. The Austrian Minister assured him of the\r\nmoderation of the allies, especially of England, and of their wish for\r\na lasting peace founded on the principle of the balance of power.\r\nFrance must give up all control of Spain, Italy, and Germany, and\r\nreturn to her natural frontiers, the Rhine, the Alps, and the\r\nPyrenees. Lord Aberdeen, our ambassador to Austria, and Count\r\nNesselrode, the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, were present at\r\nthe second interview, and assented to this statement, the latter\r\npledging his word that it had the approval of Prussia. Aberdeen added\r\nhis assurance that England was prepared to relax her maritime code and\r\nsacrifice many of her conquests in order to attain a durable peace. To\r\nthese Frankfurt overtures Napoleon charged Maret to answer in vaguely\r\nfavourable terms, and to suggest the meeting of a European Congress at\r\nMannheim. The effect of this Note (November 16th) was marred by the\r\nstrange statement--\"a peace based on the independence of all nations,\r\nboth from the continental and the maritime point of view, has always\r\nbeen the constant object of the desires and policy of the Emperor\r\n[Napoleon].\"[388]\r\n\r\nMetternich in reply pointed out that the French Government had not\r\naccepted the proposed terms as a basis for negotiations. The new\r\nForeign Minister, Caulaincourt, sent off (December 2nd) an acceptance\r\nwhich was far more frank and satisfactory; but the day before he\r\npenned it, the allies had virtually withdrawn their offer, as they had\r\ntold him they would do if it was not speedily accepted. They had all\r\nalong decided not to stay the military operations; and, as these were\r\nstill flowing strongly in their favour, they could not be expected to\r\nkeep open an offer which was exceedingly favourable to Napoleon even\r\nat the time when it was made, that is, before the support of the\r\nDutch, of the Swiss, and of Murat was fully assured.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to pause for a moment to inquire what were the views of\r\nthe allied Governments, and of Napoleon himself, at this crisis when\r\nEurope was seething in the political crucible. Had Metternich the full\r\nassent of those Governments when he offered the French Emperor the\r\nnatural frontiers? Here we must separate the views of Lord Aberdeen\r\nfrom those of the British Cabinet, as represented by its Foreign\r\nMinister, Lord Castlereagh: and we must also distinguish between the\r\nEmperor Alexander and his Minister, Nesselrode, a man of weak\r\ncharacter, in whom he had little confidence. Certainly the British\r\nCabinet was not disposed to leave Antwerp in Napoleon's hands.\r\n\r\n    \"This nation,\" wrote Castlereagh to Aberdeen on November 13th, \"is\r\n    likely to view with disfavour any peace which does not confine\r\n    France within her ancient limits.... We are still ready to\r\n    encounter, with our allies, the hazards of peace, if peace can be\r\n    made on the basis proposed, satisfactorily executed [_sic_]; and\r\n    we are not inclined to go out of our way to interfere in the\r\n    internal government of France, however much we might desire to see\r\n    it placed in more pacific hands. But I am satisfied we must not\r\n    encourage our allies to patch up an imperfect arrangement. If they\r\n    will do so, we must submit; but it should appear, in that case, to\r\n    be their own act, and not ours.... I must particularly entreat you\r\n    to keep your attention upon Antwerp. The destruction of that\r\n    arsenal is essential to our safety. To leave it in the hands of\r\n    France is little short of imposing upon Great Britain the charge\r\n    of a perpetual war establishment.\"[389]\r\n\r\nThenceforth British policy inclined, though tentatively and with some\r\nhesitations, to the view that it was needful in the interests of peace\r\nto bring France back to the limits of 1791, that is, of withdrawing\r\nfrom her, not only Holland, the Rhineland and Italy, but also Belgium,\r\nSavoy, and Nice. The Prussian patriots were far more decided. They\r\nwere determined that France should not dominate the Rhineland and\r\noverawe Germany from the fortresses of Mainz, Coblentz, and Wesel. On\r\nthis subject Arndt spoke forth with no uncertain sound in a\r\npamphlet--\"The Rhine, Germany's river, not her boundary\"--which proved\r\nthat the French claim to the Rhine frontier was consonant neither with\r\nthe teachings of history nor the distribution of the two peoples. The\r\npamphlet had an immense effect in stirring up Germans to attack the\r\ncherished French doctrine of the natural frontiers, and it clinched\r\nthe claim which he had put forward in his \"Fatherland\" song of the\r\nyear before. It bade Germans strive for Trèves and Cologne, aye, even\r\nfor Strassburg and Metz. Hardenberg and Stein, differing on most\r\npoints, united in praising this work. Even before it appeared, the\r\nformer chafed at the thought of Napoleon holding the left bank of the\r\nRhine. On hearing of Metternich's Frankfurt offer to the French\r\nEmperor, he wrote in his diary: \"Propositions of peace without my\r\nassent--Rhine, Alps, Pyrenees: a mad business.\"[390]\r\n\r\nFrederick William's views were less pronounced: in fact, his proneness\r\nto see a lion in every path earned for him the _sobriquet_ of\r\nCassandra in his Chancellor's diary. But in the main he was swayed by\r\nthe Czar; and that autocrat was now determined to dictate at Paris a\r\npeace that would rid him of all prospect of his great rival's revenge.\r\nVanity and fear alike prescribed such a course of action. He longed to\r\nlead his magnificent Guards to Paris, there to display his clemency in\r\ncontrast to the action of the French at Moscow; and this sentiment was\r\nfed by fear of Napoleon. The latter motive was concealed, of course,\r\nbut Lord Aberdeen gauged its power during a private interview that he\r\nhad with Alexander at Freiburg (December 24th): \"He talked with great\r\nfreedom: he is more decided than ever as to the necessity of\r\nperseverance, and puts little trust in the fair promises of\r\nBonaparte.--'_So long as he lives there can be no security_'--he\r\nrepeated it two or three times.\"[391] We can therefore understand his\r\nconcern lest the Frankfurt terms should be accepted outright by\r\nNapoleon. Metternich, however, assured him that the French Emperor\r\nwould not assent;[392] and, as in regard to the Prague Congress, he\r\nwas substantially correct.\r\n\r\nHere again we touch on the disputed question whether Metternich played\r\na fair game against Napoleon, or whether he tempted him to play with\r\nloaded dice while his throne was at stake. The latter supposition for\r\na long time held the field; but it is untenable. On several occasions\r\nthe Austrian statesman warned Napoleon, or his trusty advisers, that\r\nthe best course open to him was to sign peace at once. He did so at\r\nDresden, and he did so now. On November 10th he sent Caulaincourt a\r\nletter, of which these are the most important sentences:\r\n\r\n    \" ... M. de St. Aignan will speak to you of my conversations [with\r\n    him]. I expect nothing from them, but I shall have done my duty.\r\n    France will never sign a more fortunate peace than that which the\r\n    Powers will make to-day, and tomorrow if they have reverses. New\r\n    successes may extend their views.... I do not doubt that the\r\n    approach of the allied armies to the frontiers of France may\r\n    facilitate the formation of great armaments by her Government. The\r\n    questions will become problematical for the civilized world; but\r\n    the Emperor Napoleon will not make peace. There is my profession\r\n    of faith, and I shall never be happier than if I am wrong.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter rings true in every part. Metternich made no secret of\r\nsending it, but allowed Lord Aberdeen to see it.[393] And by good\r\nfortune it reached Caulaincourt about the time when he assumed the\r\nportfolio of Foreign Affairs. Its substance must therefore have been\r\nknown to Napoleon; and the tone of the Frankfurt proposals ought to\r\nhave convinced him of the need of speedily making peace while Austria\r\nheld out the olive branch from across the Rhine. But Metternich's\r\ngloomy forecast was only too true. During his sojourn at Paris he had\r\ntested the rigidity of that cast-iron will.\r\n\r\nIn fact, no one who knew the Emperor's devotion to Italy could believe\r\nthat he would give up Piedmont and Liguria. His own despatches show\r\nthat he never contemplated such a surrender. On November 20th he gave\r\norders for the enrolling of 46,000 Frenchmen _of mature age_--\"not\r\nItalians or Belgians\"--who were to reinforce Eugène and help him to\r\ndefend Italy; that, too, at a time when the defence of Champagne and\r\nLanguedoc was about to devolve on lads of eighteen.\r\n\r\nHe was equally determined not to give up Holland. On the possession of\r\nthis maritime and industrious community he had always laid great\r\nstress. He once remarked to Roederer that the ruin of the French\r\nBourbons was due to three events--the Battle of Rossbach, the affair\r\nof the diamond necklace, and the victory of Anglo-Prussian influence\r\nover that of France in Dutch affairs (1787). He even appealed to\r\nNature to prove that that land must form part of the French Empire.\r\n\"Holland,\" said one of his Ministers in 1809, \"is the alluvium of the\r\nRhine, Meuse, and Scheldt--in other words, one of the great arteries\r\nof the Empire.\" Before the last battle at Leipzig he told Merveldt\r\nthat he could not grant Holland its independence, for it would fall\r\nunder the tutelage of England. And even while his Empire was crumbling\r\naway after that disaster, he wrote to his mother: \"Holland is a French\r\ncountry, _and will remain so for ever_.\"[394]\r\n\r\nRussia, Prussia, and Britain were equally determined that the Dutch\r\nshould be independent; and if Metternich wavered on the subject of\r\nDutch independence, his hesitation was at an end by the middle of\r\nDecember, for a memorandum of the Russian diplomatist, Pozzo di Borgo,\r\nstates that Metternich then regarded the Rhine boundary as ending at\r\nDüsseldorf: \"after that town the river takes the name of Waal.\"[395]\r\nSuch juggling with geography was surely superfluous; for by that time\r\nthe Frankfurt terms had virtually lapsed, owing to Napoleon's belated\r\nacceptance; and Metternich had joined the other allied Governments\r\nthat now demanded a more thorough solution of the boundary question.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the allies were now able to make political capital out of\r\ntheir recent moderation.[396] On December 1st they issued an appeal to\r\nthe French nation to the following effect: \"We do not make war on\r\nFrance, but we are casting off the yoke which your Government imposed\r\non our countries. We hoped to have found peace before touching your\r\nsoil: we now go to find it there.\"\r\n\r\nIf the sovereigns hoped by means of this declaration to separate\r\nFrance from Napoleon, they erred. To cross the Rhine was to attack,\r\nnot Napoleon, but the French Revolution. Belgium and the Rhine\r\nboundary had been won by Dumouriez, Jourdain, Pichegru, and Moreau, at\r\na time when Bonaparte's name was unknown outside Corsica and Provence.\r\nFrance had looked on wearily at Napoleon's wars in Germany, Spain, and\r\nRussia: they concerned him, not her. But when the \"sacred soil\" was\r\nthreatened, citizens began to close their ranks: they ceased their\r\ndeclamations against the crushing taxes and youth-slaying\r\nconscription: they submitted to heavier taxes and levies of still\r\nyounger lads. In fact, by doffing the mask of Charlemagne, the Emperor\r\nbecame once more the Bonaparte of the days of Marengo.\r\n\r\nHe counted on some such change in public opinion; and it enabled him\r\nto defy with impunity the beginnings of a Parliamentary opposition.\r\nThe Senate had been puffily obsequious, as usual; but the Corps\r\nLégislatif had mistaken its functions. Summoned to vote new taxes, it\r\npresumed to give advice. A commission of its members agreed to a\r\nreport on the existing situation, drawn up by Lainé, which gave the\r\nEmperor great offence. Its crime lay in its outspoken requests that\r\npeace should be concluded on the basis of the natural frontiers, that\r\nthe rigours of the conscription should be abated, and that the laws\r\nwhich guaranteed the free exercise of political rights should be\r\nmaintained intact. The Emperor was deeply incensed, and, despite the\r\nadvice of his Ministers, determined to dissolve the Chamber forthwith\r\n(December 31st). Not content with this exercise of arbitrary power, he\r\nsubjected its members to a barrack-like rebuke at the official\r\nreception on New Year's Day.--He had convoked them to do good, and\r\nthey had done evil. Two battles lost in Champagne would not have been\r\nso harmful as their last action. What was their mandate compared with\r\nhis? France had twice chosen _him_ by some millions of votes: while\r\n_they_ were nominated only by a few hundreds apiece. They had flung\r\nmud at him: but he was a man who might be slain, never dishonoured. He\r\nwould fight for the nation, hurl back the foe, and conclude an\r\nhonourable peace. Then, for their shame, he would print and circulate\r\ntheir report.--Such was the gist of this diatribe, which he shot forth\r\nin strident tones and with flashing eyes. He had the copies of the\r\nreport destroyed, and dismissed the deputies to their homes throughout\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe country, in the main, took his side; and doubtless the national\r\ninstinct was sound; for the allies had crossed the Rhine, and France\r\nonce more was in danger. As in 1793, when the nation welcomed the\r\ntriumph of the dare-devil Jacobins over the respectable parliamentary\r\nGirondins, as promising a vigorous rule and the expulsion of the\r\nmonarchical invaders, so now the soldiers and peasants, if not the\r\nmiddle classes, rejoiced at the discomfiture of the talkers by the one\r\nnecessary man of action. The general feeling was pithily expressed by\r\nan old peasant: \"It's no longer a question of Bonaparte. Our soil is\r\ninvaded: let us go and fight.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the feeling which the Emperor ruthlessly exploited. He\r\ndecreed the enrolment of a great force of National Guards, exacted\r\nfurther levies for the regular army, and ordered a _levée en masse_\r\nfor the eastern Departments. The difficulties in his way were\r\nenormous. But he flung himself at the task with incomparable _verve_.\r\nSoldiers were wanting: youths were dragged forth, even from the\r\nroyalist districts of the extreme north and west and south. Money was\r\nwanting: it was extorted from all quarters, and Napoleon not only\r\nlavished 55,000,000 francs from his own private hoard, but seized that\r\nof his parsimonious mother.[397] Cannon, muskets, uniforms were\r\nwanting: their manufacture was pushed on with feverish haste: Napoleon\r\nordered his War Office to \"procure all the cloth in France, good and\r\nbad,\" so as to have 200,000 uniforms ready by the end of February; and\r\nhe counted on having half a million of effectives in the field at the\r\nclose of spring.\r\n\r\nAmong these he reckoned--so, at least, he wrote to Melzi--\"nearly\r\n200,000\" French soldiers from Arragon, Catalonia, and at Bayonne. Even\r\nif we allow for his desire to encourage his officials in Italy, the\r\nestimate is curious. Wellington at that time, it is true, had lessened\r\nhis numbers by sending back across the Pyrenees all his Spanish\r\ntroops, whose atrocities endangered that good understanding with the\r\nFrench peasantry which our great leader, for political motives, was\r\ndetermined to cultivate.[398] Yet, despite the shrinkage in numbers,\r\nhe drove the French from the banks of the River Nive, and inflicted on\r\nthem severe losses in desperate conflicts near Bayonne (December\r\n9th-13th). In fact, the intrenched camp in front of that town was now\r\nthe sole barrier to Wellington's advance northwards, and it was with\r\ndifficulty that Soult clung to this position. The peasantry, too,\r\nfinding that they were far better treated by Wellington's troops than\r\nby their own soldiers, began to favour the allied cause, with results\r\nthat will shortly appear. Yet these disquieting symptoms did not daunt\r\nNapoleon; for he now based his hopes of resisting the British advance\r\non a compact which he had concluded with Ferdinand VII., the rightful\r\nKing of Spain.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he returned to St. Cloud after the Leipzig campaign he made\r\nsecret overtures to that unhappy exile;[399] and by the Treaty of\r\nValençay (December 11th, 1813) he agreed to recognize him as King of\r\nthe whole of Spain, provided that British and French troops evacuated\r\nthat land. His imagination ran riot in picturing the results of this\r\ntreaty. Ferdinand was to enter Spain; Suchet, then playing a losing\r\ngame in Catalonia, was quietly to withdraw his columns through the\r\nPyrenees, while Wellington would have his base of operations cut from\r\nunder him, and thenceforth be a negligeable quantity.[400] These\r\npleasing fancies all rested on the acceptance of the new treaty by the\r\nSpanish Regency and Cortès. But, alas for Napoleon! they at once\r\nrejected it, declaring null and void all acts of Ferdinand while he\r\nwas a prisoner, and forbidding all negotiations with France while\r\nFrench troops remained in the Peninsula (January 8th).\r\n\r\nEqually disappointing were affairs in Italy. On the 11th of January,\r\nMurat made an alliance with Austria, and promised to aid her with a\r\ncorps of 30,000 Neapolitans, while she guaranteed him his throne and a\r\nslice of the Roman territory. Napoleon directed Eugène, as soon as\r\nthis bad news was confirmed, to prepare to fall back on the Alps. But,\r\nin order to clog Murat's movements, the Emperor resolved to make use\r\nof the spiritual power, which for six years he had slighted. He gave\r\norders that the aged Pope should be released from his detention at\r\nFontainebleau, and hurried secretly to Rome. \"Let him burst on that\r\nplace like a clap of thunder,\" he wrote to Savary (January 21st). But\r\nthis stagey device was not to succeed. Even now Napoleon insisted on\r\nconditions with which Pius VII. could not conscientiously comply, and\r\nhe was still detained at Tarrascon when his captor was setting out for\r\nElba.\r\n\r\nThree days after Murat's desertion, Denmark fell away from Napoleon.\r\nOverborne by the forces of Bernadotte, the little kingdom made peace\r\nwith England and Sweden, agreeing to yield up Norway to the latter\r\nPower in consideration of recovering an indemnity in Germany. To us\r\nthe Danes ceded Heligoland. Thus, within three months of the disaster\r\nat Leipzig, all Napoleon's allies forsook him, and all but the Danes\r\nwere now about to fight against him--a striking proof of the\r\nartificiality of his domination.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was clear that even France would soon be stricken to\r\nthe heart unless Napoleon speedily concentrated his forces. On the\r\nnorth and east the allies were advancing with a speed that nonplussed\r\nthe Emperor. Accustomed to sluggish movements on their part, he had\r\nnot expected an invasion in force before the spring, and here it was\r\nin the first days of January. Bülow and Graham had overrun Holland.\r\nThe allies, with the exception of the Czar, had no scruples about\r\ninfringing the neutrality of Switzerland, as Napoleon had consistently\r\ndone, and the constitution, which he had imposed upon that land eleven\r\nyears before, now straightway collapsed. Detaching a strong corps\r\nsouthwards to hold the Simplon and Great St. Bernard Passes and\r\nthreaten Lyons, Schwarzenberg led the allied Grand Army into France by\r\nway of Basel, Belfort, and Langres. The prompt seizure of the Plateau\r\nof Langres was an important success. The allies thereby turned the\r\nstrong defensive lines of the Vosges Mountains, and of the Rivers\r\nMoselle and Meuse, so that Blücher, with his \"Army of Silesia,\" was\r\nable rapidly to advance into Lorraine, and drive Victor from Nancy.\r\nToul speedily surrendered, and the sturdy veteran then turned to the\r\nsouth-west, in order to come into touch with Schwarzenberg's columns.\r\nNeither leader delayed before the eastern fortresses. The allies had\r\nlearnt from Napoleon to invest or observe them and press on, a course\r\nwhich their vast superiority of force rendered free from danger.\r\nSchwarzenberg, on the 25th, had 150,000 men between Langres, Chaumont,\r\nand Bar-sur-Aube; while Blücher, with about half those numbers,\r\ncrossed the Marne at St. Dizier, and was drawing near to Brienne. In\r\nfront of them were the weak and disheartened corps of Marmont, Ney,\r\nVictor, and Macdonald, mustering in all about 50,000 men. Desertions\r\nto the allies were frequent, and Blücher, wishing to show that the war\r\nwas practically over, dismissed both deserters and prisoners to their\r\nhomes.[401]\r\n\r\nBut the war was far from over: it had not yet begun. Hitherto Napoleon\r\nhad hurried on the preparations from Paris, but the urgency of the\r\ndanger now beckoned him eastwards. As before, he left the Empress as\r\nRegent of France, but appointed King Joseph as Lieutenant-General of\r\nFrance. On Sunday, January 23rd, he held the last reception. It was in\r\nthe large hall of the Tuileries, where the Parisian rabble had forced\r\nLouis XVI. to don the _bonnet rouge_. Another dynasty was now\r\ntottering to its fall; but none could have read its doom in the faces\r\nof the obsequious courtiers, or of the officers of the Parisian\r\nNational Guards, who offered their homage to the heir of the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nHe came forward with the Empress and the King of Rome, a flaxen-haired\r\nchild of three winters, clad in the uniform of the National Guard.\r\nTaking the boy by the hand into the midst of the circle, he spoke\r\nthese touching words: \"Gentlemen,--I am about to set out for the army.\r\nI intrust to you what I hold dearest in the world--my wife and my son.\r\nLet there be no political divisions.\" He then carried him amidst his\r\ndignitaries and officers, while sobs and shouts bespoke the warmth of\r\nthe feelings kindled by this scene. And never, surely, since the young\r\nMaria Theresa appealed in person to the Hungarian magnates to defend\r\nher against rapacious neighbours, had any monarch spoken so straight\r\nto the hearts of his lieges. The secret of his success is not far to\r\nseek. He had not commanded as Emperor: he had appealed as a father to\r\nfathers and mothers.\r\n\r\nIt is painful to have to add that many who there swore to defend him\r\nwere even then beginning to plot his overthrow. Most painful of all is\r\nit to remember that when, before dawn of the 25th, Marie Louise bade\r\nhim farewell, it was her last farewell: for she, too, deserted him in\r\nhis misfortunes, refused to share his exile, and ultimately degraded\r\nherself by her connection with Count Neipperg.\r\n\r\nHeedless of all that the future might bring, and concentrating his\r\nthoughts on the problems of the present, the great warrior journeyed\r\nrapidly eastwards to Châlons-sur-Marne, and opened the most glorious\r\nof his campaigns. And yet it began with disaster. At Brienne, among\r\nthe scenes of his school-days, he assailed Blücher in the hope of\r\npreventing the junction of the Army of Silesia with that of\r\nSchwarzenberg further south (January 29th). After sharp fighting, the\r\nPrussians were driven from the castle and town. But the success was\r\nillusory. Blücher withdrew towards Bar-sur-Aube, in order to gain\r\nsupport from Schwarzenberg, and, three days later, turned the tables\r\non Napoleon while the latter was indulging in hopes that the allies\r\nwere about to treat seriously for peace.[402] Nevertheless, though\r\nsurprised by greatly superior numbers, the 40,000 French clung\r\nobstinately to the village of La Rothière until their thin lines were\r\neverywhere driven in or outflanked, with the loss of 73 cannon and\r\nmore than 3,000 prisoners. Each side lost about 5,000 killed and\r\nwounded--a mere trifle to the allies, but a grave disaster to the\r\ndefenders.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor was much discouraged. He had put forth his full strength,\r\nexposed his own person to the hottest fire, so as to encourage his\r\nmen, and yet failed to prevent the union of the allied armies, or to\r\nhold the line of the River Aube. Early on the morrow he left the\r\ncastle of Brienne, and took the road for Troyes; while Marmont, with a\r\ncorps now reduced to less than 3,000 men, bravely defended the passage\r\nof the Voire at Rosnay, and, after delaying the pursuit, took post at\r\nArcis-sur-Aube. The means of defence, both moral and material, seemed\r\nwellnigh exhausted. When, on February 3rd, Napoleon entered Troyes,\r\nscarcely a single _vivat_ was heard. Even the old troops were cast\r\ndown by defeat and hunger, while as many as 6,000 conscripts are said\r\nto have deserted. The inhabitants refused to supply the necessaries of\r\nlife except upon requisition. \"The army is perishing of famine,\"\r\nwrites the Emperor at Troyes. Again at Nogent: \"Twelve men have died\r\nof hunger, though we have used fire and sword to get food on our way\r\nhere.\" And, now, into the space left undefended between the Marne and\r\nthe Aube, Blücher began to thrust his triumphant columns, with no\r\nbarrier to check him until he neared the environs of Paris. Once more\r\nthe Prussian and Russian officers looked on the war as over, and\r\ninvited one another to dinner at the Palais-Royal in a week's\r\ntime.[403]\r\n\r\nBut it was on this confidence of the old hussar-general that Napoleon\r\ncounted. He knew his proneness to daring movements, and the strong\r\nbias of Schwarzenberg towards delay: he also divined that they would\r\nnow separate their forces, Blücher making straight for Paris, while\r\nother columns would threaten the capital by way of Troyes and Sens.\r\nThat was why he fell back on Troyes, so as directly to oppose the\r\nlatter movement, \"or so as to return and manoeuvre against Blücher and\r\nstay his march.\"[404] Another motive was his expectation of finding at\r\nNogent the 15,000 veterans whom he had ordered Soult to send\r\nnorthwards. And doubtless the final reason was his determination to\r\nuse the sheltering curve of the Seine, which between Troyes and Nogent\r\nflows within twenty miles of the high-road that Blücher must use if he\r\nstruck at Paris. At many a crisis Napoleon had proved the efficacy of\r\na great river line. From Rivoli to Friedland his career abounds in\r\nexamples of riverine tactics. The war of 1813 was one prolonged\r\nstruggle for the line of the Elbe. He still continued the war because\r\nhe could not yet bring himself to sign away the Rhenish fortresses:\r\nand he now hoped to regain that \"natural boundary\" by blows showered\r\non divided enemies from behind the arc of the Seine.\r\n\r\nWith wonderful prescience he had guessed at the general plan of the\r\nallies. But he could scarcely have dared to hope that on that very day\r\n(February 2nd) they were holding a council of war at Brienne, and\r\nformally resolved that Blücher should march north-west on Paris with\r\nabout 50,000 men, while the allied Grand Army of nearly three times\r\nthose numbers was to diverge south-west towards Bar-sur-Seine and Sens.\r\nSo unequal a partition of forces seemed to court disaster. It is true\r\nthat the allies had no magazines of supplies: they could not march in\r\nan undivided host through a hostile land where the scanty defenders\r\nthemselves were nearly starving. If, however, they decided to move at\r\nall, it was needful to allot the more dangerous task to a powerful\r\nforce. Above all, it was necessary to keep their main armies well in\r\ntouch with one another and with the foe. Yet these obvious precautions\r\nwere not taken. In truth, the separation of the allies was dictated\r\nmore by political jealousy than by military motives. To these political\r\naffairs we must now allude; for they had no small effect in leading\r\nNapoleon on to an illusory triumph and an irretrievable overthrow. We\r\nwill show their influence, first on the conduct of the allies, and\r\nthen on the actions of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe alarm of Austria at the growing power of Russia and Prussia was\r\nbecoming acute. She had drawn the sword only because Napoleon's\r\nresentment was more to be feared than Alexander's ambition. But all\r\nhad changed since then. The warrior who, five months ago, still had\r\nhis sword at the throat of Germany, was now being pursued across the\r\ndreary flats of Champagne. And his eastern rival, who then plaintively\r\nsued for Austria's aid, now showed a desire to establish Russian\r\ncontrol over all the Polish lands, indemnifying Prussia for losses in\r\nthat quarter by the acquisition of Saxony. Both of these changes would\r\npress heavily on Austria from the north; and she was determined to\r\nprevent them as far as possible. Then there was the vexed question of\r\nthe reconstruction of Germany to which we shall recur later on.\r\nSmaller matters, involving the relations of the allies to Bernadotte,\r\nDenmark, and Switzerland further complicated the situation: but, above\r\nall, there was the problem of the future limits and form of government\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nOn that topic there were two chief parties: those who desired merely\r\nto clip Napoleon's wings, and those who sought to bring back France to\r\nher old boundaries. The Emperor Francis was still disposed to leave\r\nhim the \"natural frontiers,\" provided he gave up all control of\r\nGermany, Holland, and Italy. On the other side were the Czar and the\r\nforward wing of the Prussian patriots. Frederick William was more\r\ncautious, but in the main he deferred to the Czar's views on the\r\nboundary question. Still, so powerful was the influence of the Emperor\r\nFrancis, Metternich, and Schwarzenberg, that the two parties were\r\nevenly balanced and beset by many suspicions and fears, until the\r\narrival of the British Foreign Minister, Castlereagh, began to restore\r\nsomething like confidence and concord.\r\n\r\nThe British Cabinet had decided that, as none of our three envoys then\r\nat the allied headquarters had much diplomatic experience, our\r\nMinister should go in person to supervise the course of affairs. He\r\nreached head-quarters in the third week of January, and what Thiers\r\nhas called the proud simplicity of his conduct, contrasting as it did\r\nwith the uneasy finesse of Metternich and Nesselrode, imparted to his\r\ncounsels a weight which they merited from their disinterestedness.\r\nGreat Britain was in a very strong position. She had borne the brunt\r\nof the struggle before the present coalition took shape: apart from\r\nsome modest gains to Hanover, she was about to take no part in the\r\nensuing territorial scramble: she even offered to give up many of her\r\noceanic conquests, provided that the European settlement would be such\r\nas to guarantee a lasting peace.[405] And this, the British Minister\r\ncame to see, could not be attained while Napoleon reigned over a Great\r\nFrance: the only sure pledge of peace would be the return of that\r\ncountry to its old frontiers, and preferably to its ancient dynasty.\r\n\r\nOn the question of boundaries the Czar's views were not clearly\r\ndefined; they were personal rather than territorial. He was determined\r\nto get rid of Napoleon; but he would not, as yet, hear of the\r\nre-establishment of the Bourbons. He disliked that dynasty in general,\r\nand Louis XVIII. in particular. Bernadotte seemed to him a far fitter\r\nsuccessor to Napoleon than the gouty old gentleman who for three and\r\ntwenty years had been morosely flitting about Europe and issuing\r\nuseless proclamations.\r\n\r\nHere, indeed, was Napoleon's great chance: there was no man fit to\r\nsucceed him, and he knew it. Scarcely anyone but Bernadotte himself\r\nagreed with the Czar as to the fitness of the choice just named. To\r\nthe allies the Prince Royal of Sweden was suspect for his loiterings,\r\nand to Frenchmen he seemed a traitor. We find that Stein disagreed\r\nwith the Czar on this point, and declared that the Bourbons were the\r\nonly alternative to Napoleon. Assuredly, this was not because the\r\ngreat German loved that family, but simply because he saw that their\r\nvery mediocrity would be a pledge that France would not again overflow\r\nher old limits and submerge Europe.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was the strength of Castlereagh's position. Amidst the\r\nwarping disputes and underhand intrigues his claims were clear,\r\ndisinterested, and logically tenable. Besides, they were so urged as\r\nto calm the disputants. He quietly assured Metternich that Britain\r\nwould resist the absorption of the whole of Poland and Saxony by\r\nRussia and Prussia; and on his side the Austrian statesman showed that\r\nhe would not oppose the return of the Bourbons to France \"from any\r\nfamily considerations,\" provided that that act came as the act of the\r\nFrench nation.[406] And this was a proviso on which our Government and\r\nWellington already laid great stress.\r\n\r\nCastlereagh's straightforward behaviour had an immense influence in\r\nleading Metternich to favour a more drastic solution of the French\r\nquestion than he had previously advocated. The Frankfurt proposals\r\nwere now quietly waived, and Metternich came to see the need of\r\nwithdrawing Belgium from France and intrusting it to the House of\r\nOrange. Still, the Austrian statesman was for concluding peace with\r\nNapoleon as soon as might be, though he confessed in his private\r\nletters that peace did not depend on the Châtillon parleys. Some\r\npersons, he wrote, wanted the Bourbons back: still more wished for a\r\nRegency (_i.e._, Marie Louise as Regent for Napoleon II.): others\r\nsaid: \"Away with Napoleon, no peace is possible with him\": the masses\r\ncried out for peace, so as to end the whole affair: but added\r\nMetternich: \"The riddle will be solved before or in Paris.\"[407] There\r\nspoke the discreet opportunist, always open to the logic of facts and\r\nthe persuasion of Castlereagh.\r\n\r\nOur Minister found the sovereigns of Russia and Prussia far less\r\ntractable; and he only partially succeeded in lulling their suspicions\r\nthat Metternich was hand and glove with Napoleon. So deep was the\r\nCzar's distrust of the Austrian statesman and commander-in-chief that\r\nhe resolved to brush aside Metternich's diplomatic _pourparlers_, to\r\npush on rapidly to Paris, and there dictate peace.[408]\r\n\r\nBut it was just this eagerness of the Czar and the Prussians to reach\r\nParis which kept alive Austrian fears. A complete triumph to their\r\narms would seal the doom of Poland and Saxony; and it has been thought\r\nthat Schwarzenberg, who himself longed for peace, not only sought to\r\nsave Austrian soldiers by keeping them back, but that at this time he\r\ndid less than his duty in keeping touch with Blücher. Several times\r\nduring the ensuing days the charge of treachery was hurled by the\r\nPrussians against the Austrians, and once at least by Frederick\r\nWilliam himself. But it seems more probable that Metternich and\r\nSchwarzenberg held their men back merely for prudential motives until\r\nthe resumption of the negotiations with France should throw more light\r\non the tangled political jungle through which the allies were groping.\r\nIt is significant that while Schwarzenberg cautiously felt about for\r\nNapoleon's rearguard, of which he lost touch for two whole days,\r\nMetternich insisted that the peace Congress must be opened.\r\nCaulaincourt had for several days been waiting near the allied\r\nhead-quarters; and, said the Austrian Minister, it would be a breach\r\nof faith to put him off any longer now that Castlereagh had arrived.\r\nOnly when Austria threatened to withdraw from the Coalition did\r\nAlexander concede this point, and then with a very bad grace; for the\r\nresumption of the negotiations virtually tied him to the neighbourhood\r\nof Châtillon-sur-Seine, the town fixed for the Congress, while Blücher\r\nwas rapidly moving towards Paris with every prospect of snatching from\r\nthe imperial brow the coveted laurel of a triumphal entry.\r\n\r\nTo prevent this interference with his own pet plans, the susceptible\r\nautocrat sent off from Bar-sur-Seine (February 7th) an order that\r\nBlücher was not to enter Paris, but must await the arrival of the\r\nsovereigns. The order was needless. Napoleon, goaded to fury by the\r\ndemands which the allies on that very day formulated at Châtillon,\r\nflung himself upon Blücher and completely altered the whole military\r\nsituation. But before describing this wonderful effort, we must take a\r\nglance at the diplomatic overtures which spurred him on.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of Châtillon opened on February 5th, and on that day\r\nCastlereagh gained his point, that questions about our maritime code\r\nshould be completely banished from the discussions. Two days later the\r\nallies declared that France must withdraw within the boundaries of\r\n1791, with the exception of certain changes made for mutual\r\nconvenience and of some colonial retrocessions that England would\r\ngrant to France. The French plenipotentiary, Caulaincourt, heard this\r\ndemand with a quiet but strained composure: he reminded them that at\r\nFrankfurt they had proposed to leave France the Rhine and the Alps; he\r\ninquired what colonial sacrifices England was prepared to make if she\r\ncooped up France in her old limits in Europe. To this our\r\nplenipotentiaries Aberdeen, Cathcart, and Stewart refused to reply\r\nuntil he assented to the present demand of the allies. He very\r\nproperly refused to do this; and, despite his eagerness to come to an\r\narrangement and end the misfortunes of France, referred the matter to\r\nhis master.[409]\r\n\r\nWhat were Napoleon's views on these questions? It is difficult to\r\nfollow the workings of his mind before the time when Caulaincourt's\r\ndespatch flashed the horrible truth upon him that he might, after all,\r\nleave France smaller and weaker than he found her. Then the lightnings\r\nof his wrath flash forth, and we see the tumult and anguish of that\r\nmighty soul: but previously the storm-wrack of passion and the\r\ncloud-bank of his clinging will are lit up by few gleams of the\r\nearlier piercing intelligence. On January the 4th he had written to\r\nCaulaincourt that the policy of England and the personal rancour of\r\nthe Czar would drag Austria along. If Fortune betrayed him (Napoleon)\r\nhe would give up the throne: never would he sign any shameful peace.\r\nBut he added: \"You must see what Metternich wants: it is not to\r\nAustria's interest to push matters to the end.\" In the accompanying\r\ninstructions to his plenipotentiary, he seems to assent to the Alpine\r\nand Rhenish frontiers, but advises him to sign the preliminaries as\r\nvaguely as possible, \"_as we have everything to gain by delay_.\" The\r\nRhine frontier must be so described as to leave France the Dutch\r\nfortresses: and Savona and Spezzia must also count as on the French\r\nside of the Alps. These, be it observed, are his notions when he has\r\nnot heard of the defection of Murat, or the rejection of his Spanish\r\nbargain by the Cortès.\r\n\r\nTwelve days later he proposes to Metternich an armistice, and again\r\nsuggests that it is not to Austria's interest to press matters too\r\nfar. But the allies are too wary to leave such a matter to Metternich:\r\nat Teplitz they bound themselves to common action; and the proposal\r\nonly shows them the need of pushing on fast while their foe is still\r\nunprepared. Once more his old optimism asserts itself. The first\r\nFrench success, that at Brienne, leads him to hope that the allies\r\nwill now be ready to make peace. Even after the disaster at La\r\nRothière, he believes that the mere arrival of Caulaincourt at the\r\nallied headquarters will foment the discords which there exist.[410]\r\nThen, writing amidst the unspeakable miseries at Troyes (February\r\n4th), he upbraids Caulaincourt for worrying him about \"powers and\r\ninstructions when it is still doubtful if the enemy wants to\r\nnegotiate. His terms, it seems, are determined on beforehand. As soon\r\nas you have them, you have the power to accept them or to refer them\r\nto me within twenty-four hours.\"\r\n\r\nAfter midnight, he again directs him to accept the terms, if\r\nacceptable: \"in the contrary case we will run the risks of a battle;\r\neven the loss of Paris, and all that will ensue.\" Later on that day he\r\nallows Maret to send a despatch giving Caulaincourt \"carte blanche\" to\r\nconclude peace.[411] But the plenipotentiary dared not take on himself\r\nthe responsibility of accepting the terms offered by the allies two\r\ndays later. The last despatch was too vague to enable him to sign away\r\nmany thousands of square miles of territory: it contradicted the tenor\r\nof Napoleon's letters, which empowered him to assent to nothing less\r\nthan the Frankfurt terms. And thus was to slip away one more chance of\r\nbringing about peace--a peace that would strip the French Empire of\r\nfrontier lands and alien peoples, but leave it to the peasants' ruler,\r\nNapoleon.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the Emperor's words and letters breathed nothing but warlike\r\nresolve. Famine and misery accompany him on his march to Nogent, and\r\nthere, on the 7th, he hears tidings that strike despair to every heart\r\nbut his. An Anglo-German force is besieging the staunch old Carnot in\r\nAntwerp; Bülow has entered Brussels; Belgium is lost: Macdonald's weak\r\ncorps is falling back on Epernay, hard pressed by Yorck, while Blücher\r\nis heading for Paris. Last of all comes on the morrow Caulaincourt's\r\ndespatch announcing that the allies now insist on France returning to\r\nthe limits of 1791.\r\n\r\nNever, surely, since the time of Job did calamity shower her blows so\r\nthickly on the head of mortal man: and never were they met with less\r\nresignation and more undaunted defiance. After receiving the black\r\nbudget of news the Emperor straightway shut himself up. For some time\r\nhis Marshals left him alone: but, as Caulaincourt's courier was\r\nwaiting for the reply, Berthier and Maret ventured to intrude on his\r\ngrief. He tossed them the letter containing the allied terms. A long\r\nsilence ensued, while they awaited his decision. As he spoke not a\r\nword, they begged him to give way and grant peace to France. Then his\r\npent-up feelings burst forth: \"What, you would have me sign a treaty\r\nlike that, and trample under foot my coronation oath! Unheard-of\r\ndisasters may have snatched from me the promise to renounce my\r\nconquests: but, give up those made before me--never! God keep me from\r\nsuch a disgrace. Reply to Caulaincourt since you wish it, but tell him\r\nthat I reject this treaty. I prefer to run the uttermost risks of\r\nwar.\" He threw himself on his camp bed. Maret waited by his side, and\r\ngained from him in calmer moments permission to write to Caulaincourt\r\nin terms that allowed the negotiation to proceed. At dawn on the 9th\r\nMaret came back hoping to gain assent to despatches that he had been\r\ndrawing up during the night. To his surprise he found the Emperor\r\nstretched out over large charts, compass in hand. \"Ah, there you are,\"\r\nwas his greeting; \"now it's a question of very different matters. I am\r\ngoing to beat Blücher: if I succeed, the state of affairs will\r\nentirely change, and then we will see.\"\r\n\r\nThe tension of his feelings at this time, when rage and desperation\r\nfinally gave way to a fixed resolve to stake all on a blow at\r\nBlücher's flank, finds expression in a phrase which has been omitted\r\nfrom the official correspondence.[412] In one of the five letters\r\nwhich he wrote to Joseph on the 9th, he remarked: \"Pray the Madonna of\r\narmies to be for us: Louis, who is a saint, may engage to give her a\r\nlighted candle.\" A curiously sarcastic touch, probably due to his\r\nannoyance at the _Misereres_ and \"prayers forty hours long\" at Paris\r\nwhich he bade his Ministers curtail. Or was it a passing flash of that\r\nreligious sentiment which he professed in his declining years?\r\n\r\nHe certainly counted on victory over Blücher. A week earlier, he had\r\nforeseen the chance that that leader would expose his flank: on the\r\n7th he charged Marmont to occupy Sézanne, where he would be strongly\r\nsupported; on the afternoon of the 9th he set out from Nogent to\r\nreinforce his Marshal; and on the morrow Marmont and Ney fell upon one\r\nof Blücher's scattered columns at Champaubert. It was a corps of\r\nRussians, less than 5,000 strong, with no horsemen and but twenty-four\r\ncannon; the Muscovites offered a stout resistance, but only 1,500\r\nescaped.[413] Blücher's line of march was now cut in twain. He himself\r\nwas at Vertus with the last column; his foremost corps, under Sacken,\r\nwas west of Montmirail, while Yorck was far to the north of that\r\nvillage observing Macdonald's movements along the Château-Thierry\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor with 20,000 men might therefore hope to destroy these\r\ncorps piecemeal. Leaving Marmont along with Grouchy's horse to hold\r\nBlücher in check on the east, he struck westwards against Sacken's\r\nRussians near Montmirail. The shock was terrible; both sides were\r\nweary with night marches on miry roads, along which cannon had to be\r\ndragged by double teams: yet, though footsore and worn with cold and\r\nhunger, the men fought with sustained fury, the French to stamp out\r\nthe barbarous invaders who had wasted their villages, the Russians to\r\nhold their position until Yorck's Prussians should stretch a\r\nsuccouring hand from the north. Many a time did the French rush at the\r\nvillage of Marchais held by Sacken: they were repeatedly repulsed,\r\nuntil, as darkness came on, Ney and Mortier with the Guard stormed a\r\nlarge farmhouse on their left. Then, at last, Sacken's men drew off in\r\nsore plight north-west across the fields, where Yorck's tardy advent\r\nalone saved them from destruction. The next day completed their\r\ndiscomfiture. Napoleon and Mortier pursued both allied corps to\r\nChâteau-Thierry and, after sharp fighting in the streets of that\r\nplace, drove them across the Marne. The townsfolk hailed the advent of\r\ntheir Emperor with unbounded joy: they had believed him to be at\r\nTroyes, beaten and dispirited; and here he was delivering them from\r\nthe brutal licence of the eastern soldiery. Nothing was impossible to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNext it was Blücher's turn. Leaving Mortier to pursue the fugitives of\r\nSacken and Yorck along the Soissons road, Napoleon left\r\nChâteau-Thierry late at night on the 13th, following the mass of his\r\ntroops to reinforce Marmont. That Marshal had yielded ground to\r\nBlücher's desperate efforts, but was standing at bay at Vauchamps,\r\nwhen Napoleon drew near to the scene of the unequal fight. Suddenly a\r\nmighty shout of \"Vive l'Empereur\" warned the assailants that they now\r\nhad to do with Napoleon. Yet no precipitation weakened the Emperor's\r\nblow: not until his cavalry greatly outnumbered that of the allies did\r\nhe begin the chief attack. Stoutly it was beaten off by the allied\r\nsquares: but Drouot's artillery ploughed through their masses, while\r\nswarms of horsemen were ready to open out those ghastly furrows. There\r\nwas nothing for it but retreat, and that across open country, where\r\nthe charges and the pounding still went on. But nothing could break\r\nthat stubborn infantry: animated by their leader, the Prussians and\r\nRussians plodded steadily eastwards, until, as darkness drew on, they\r\nfound Grouchy's horse barring the road before Etoges. \"Forward\" was\r\nstill the veteran's cry: and through the cavalry they cut their way:\r\nthrough hostile footmen that had stolen round to the village they also\r\nburst, and at last found shelter near Bergères. \"Words fail me,\" wrote\r\nColonel Hudson Lowe, \"to express my admiration at their undaunted and\r\nmanly behaviour.\"\r\n\r\nThis gallant retreat shed lustre over the rank and file. But the sins\r\nof the commanders had cost the allies dear. In four days the army of\r\nSilesia lost fully 15,000 men, and its corps were driven far asunder\r\nby Napoleon's incursion. His brilliant moves and trenchant strokes\r\nastonished the world. With less than 30,000 men he had burst into\r\nBlücher's line of march, and scattered in flight 50,000 warriors\r\nadvancing on Paris in full assurance of victory. It was not chance,\r\nbut science, that gave him these successes. Acting from behind the\r\nscreen of the Seine, he had thrown his small but undivided force\r\nagainst scattered portions of a superior force. It was the strategy of\r\nLonato and Castiglione over again; and the enthusiasm of those days\r\nbade fair to revive.\r\n\r\nHis men, who previously had tramped downheartedly over wastes of snow\r\nand miry cross-roads, now marched with head erect as in former days;\r\nthe villagers, far from being cowed by the brutalities of the\r\nCossacks, formed bands to hang upon the enemies' rear and entrap their\r\nforagers. Above all, Paris was herself once more. Before he began\r\nthese brilliant moves, he had to upbraid Cambacérès for his unmanly\r\nconduct. \"I see that instead of sustaining the Empress, you are\r\ndiscouraging her. Why lose your head thus? What mean these _Miserere_\r\nand these prayers of forty hours? Are you going mad at Paris?\" Now the\r\ncapital again breathed defiance to the foe, and sent the Emperor\r\nNational Guards. Many of these from Brittany, it is true, came \"in\r\nround hats and _sabots_\": they had no knapsacks: but they had guns,\r\nand they fought.\r\n\r\nCould he have pursued Blücher on the morrow he might probably have\r\nbroken up even that hardy infantry, now in dire straits for want of\r\nsupplies. But bad news came to hand from the south-west. Under urgent\r\npressure from the Czar, Schwarzenberg had pushed forward two columns\r\nfrom Troyes towards Paris: one of them had seized the bridge over the\r\nSeine at Bray, a day's march below Nogent: the other was nearing\r\nFontainebleau. Napoleon was furious at the neglect of Victor to guard\r\nthe crossing at Bray, and reluctantly turned away from Blücher to\r\ncrush these columns. His men marched or were carried in vehicles, by\r\nway of Meaux and Guignes, to reinforce Victor: on the 17th they drove\r\nback the outposts of Schwarzenberg's centre, while Macdonald and\r\nOudinot marched towards Nogent to threaten his right. These rapid\r\nmoves alarmed the Austrian commander, whose left, swung forward on\r\nFontainebleau, was in some danger of being cut off. He therefore sued\r\nfor an armistice. It was refused; and the request drew from Napoleon a\r\nletter to his brother Joseph full of contempt for the allies (February\r\n18th). \"It is difficult,\" he writes, \"to be so cowardly as that! He\r\n[Schwarzenberg] had constantly, and in the most insulting terms,\r\nrefused a suspension of arms of any kind, ... and yet these wretches\r\nat the first check fall on their knees. I will grant no armistice till\r\nmy territory is clear of them.\" He adds that he now expected to gain\r\nthe \"natural frontiers\" offered by the allies at Frankfurt--the\r\nminimum that he could accept with honour; and he closes with these\r\nmemorable words, which flash a searchlight on his pacific professions\r\nof thirteen months later: \"If I had agreed to the old boundaries, I\r\nshould have rushed to arms two years later, telling the nation that I\r\nhad signed not a peace, but a capitulation.\"[414]\r\n\r\nThe events of the 18th strengthened his resolve. He then attacked the\r\nCrown Prince of Würtemberg on the north side of the Seine, opposite\r\nMontereau, overthrew him by the weight of the artillery of the Guard,\r\nwhereupon a brilliant charge of Pajol's horsemen wrested the bridge\r\nfrom the South Germans and restored to the Emperor the much-needed\r\ncrossing over the river. Napoleon's activity on that day was\r\nmarvellous. He wrote or dictated eleven despatches, six of them long\r\nbefore dawn, gave instructions to an officer who was to encourage\r\nEugène to hold firm in Italy, fought a battle, directed the aim of\r\nseveral cannon, and wound up the day by severe rebukes to Marshal\r\nVictor and two generals for their recent blunders. Thus, on a brief\r\nwinter's day, he fills the _rôle_ of Emperor, organizer, tactician,\r\ncannoneer, and martinet; in fact, he crowns it by pardoning Victor,\r\nwhen that brave man vows that he cannot live away from the army, and\r\nwill fight as a common soldier among the Guards: he then and there\r\nassigns to him two divisions of the Guard. To the artillerymen the\r\n_camaraderie_ of the Emperor gave a new zest: and when they ventured\r\nto reproach him for thus risking his life, he replied with a touch of\r\nthe fatalism which enthralls a soldier's mind: \"Ah! don't fear: the\r\nball is not cast that will kill me.\"\r\n\r\nYes: Napoleon displayed during these last ten days a fertility of\r\nresource, a power to drive back the tide of events, that have dazzled\r\nposterity, as they dismayed his foes. We may seek in vain for a\r\nparallel, save perhaps in the careers of Hannibal and Frederick.\r\nAlexander the Great's victories were won over Asiatics: Cæsar's\r\nmagnificent rally of his wavering bands against the onrush of the\r\nNervii was but one effort of disciplined valour crushing the\r\nimpetuosity of the barbarian. Marlborough and Wellington often\r\ntriumphed over great odds and turned the course of history. But their\r\nstar had never set so low as that of Napoleon's after La Rothière, and\r\nnever did it rush to the zenith with a splendour like that which\r\nblinded the trained hosts of Blücher and Schwarzenberg. Whatever the\r\nmistakes of these leaders, and they were great, there is something\r\nthat defies analysis in Napoleon's sudden transformation of his beaten\r\ndispirited band into a triumphant array before which four times their\r\nnumbers sought refuge in retreat. But it is just this transcendent\r\nquality that adds a charm to the character and career of Napoleon.\r\nWhere analysis fails, there genius begins.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST ABDICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt now remained to be seen whether Napoleon would make a wise use of\r\nhis successes. While the Grand Army drew in its columns behind the\r\nsheltering line of the Seine at Troyes, the French Emperor strove to\r\nreap in diplomacy the fruits of his military prowess. In brief, he\r\nsought to detach Austria from the Coalition. From Nogent he wrote, on\r\nFebruary 21st, to the Emperor Francis, dwelling on the impolicy of\r\nAustria continuing the war. Why should she subordinate her policy to\r\nthat of England and to the personal animosities of the Czar? Why\r\nshould she see her former Belgian provinces handed over to a\r\nProtestant Dutch Prince about to be allied with the House of Brunswick\r\nby marriage? France would never give up Belgium; and he, as French\r\nEmperor, would never sign a peace that would drive her from the Rhine\r\nand exclude her from the circle of the Great Powers. But if Austria\r\nreally wished for the equilibrium of Europe, he (Napoleon) was ready\r\nto forget the past and make peace on the basis of the Frankfurt\r\nterms.[415]\r\n\r\nHad these offers been rather less exacting, and reached the allied\r\nheadquarters a week earlier, they might have led to the break up of\r\nthe Coalition. For the political situation of the allies had been even\r\nmore precarious than that of their armies. The pretensions of the Czar\r\nhad excited indignation and alarm. Swayed to and fro between the\r\ncounsels of his old tutor, Laharpe, now again at his side, and his own\r\nautocratic instincts, he declared that he would push on to Paris,\r\nconsult the will of the French people by a plébiscite, and abide by\r\nits decision, even if it gave a new lease of power to Napoleon. But\r\nside by side with this democratic proposal came another of a more\r\ndespotic type, that the military Governor of Paris must be a Russian\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nThe amusement caused by these odd notions was overshadowed by alarm.\r\nMetternich, Castlereagh, and Hardenberg saw in them a ruse for\r\nfoisting on France either Bernadotte, or an orientalized Republic, or\r\na Muscovite version of the Treaty of Tilsit. Then again, on February\r\n9th, Alexander sent a mandate to the plenipotentiaries at Châtillon,\r\nrequesting that their sessions should be suspended, though he had\r\nrecently agreed at Langres to enter into negotiations with France,\r\nprovided that the military operations were not suspended. Evidently,\r\nthen, he was bent on forcing the hands of his allies, and Austria\r\nfeared that he might at the end of the war insist on her taking\r\nAlsace, as a set-off to the loss of Eastern Galicia which he wished to\r\nabsorb. So keen was the jealousy thus aroused, that at Troyes\r\nMetternich and Hardenberg signed a secret agreement to prevent the\r\nCzar carrying matters with a high hand at Paris (February 14th); and\r\non the same day they sent him a stiff Note requesting the resumption\r\nof the negotiations with Napoleon. Indeed, Austria formally threatened\r\nto withdraw her troops from the war, unless he limited his aims to the\r\nterms propounded by the allies at Châtillon. Alexander at first\r\nrefused; but the news of Blücher's disasters shook his determination,\r\nand he assented on that day, provided that steps were at once taken to\r\nlighten the pressure on the Russian corps serving under Blücher. Thus,\r\nby February 14th, the crisis was over.[416]\r\n\r\nSchwarzenberg cautiously pushed on three columns to attract the\r\nthunderbolts that otherwise would have destroyed the Silesian Army\r\nroot and branch; and he succeeded. True, his vanguard was beaten at\r\nMontereau; but, by drawing Napoleon south and then east of the Seine,\r\nhe gave time to Blücher to strengthen his shattered array and resume\r\nthe offensive. Meanwhile Bülow, with the northern army, began to draw\r\nnear to the scene of action, and on the 23rd the allies took the wise\r\nstep of assigning his corps, along with those of Winzingerode,\r\nWoronzoff, and Strogonoff, to the Prussian veteran. The last three\r\ncorps were withdrawn from the army of Bernadotte, and that prince was\r\napprized of the fact by the Czar in a rather curt letter.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic situation had also cleared up before Napoleon's letter\r\nreached the Emperor Francis. The negotiations with Caulaincourt were\r\nresumed at Châtillon on February the 17th; and there is every reason\r\nto think that Austria, England, Prussia, and perhaps even Russia would\r\nnow gladly have signed peace with Napoleon on the basis of the French\r\nfrontiers of 1791, provided that he renounced all claims to\r\ninterference in the affairs of Europe outside those limits.[417]\r\n\r\nThese demands would certainly have been accepted by the French\r\nplenipotentiary had he listened to his own pacific promptings. But he\r\nwas now in the most painful position. Maret had informed him, the day\r\nafter Montmirail, that Napoleon was set on keeping the Rhenish and\r\nAlpine frontiers.[418] He could, therefore, do nothing but temporize.\r\nHe knew how precarious was the military supremacy just snatched by his\r\nmaster, and trusted that a few days more would bring wisdom before it\r\nwas too late. But his efforts for delay were useless.\r\n\r\nWhile he was marking time, Napoleon was sending him despatches\r\ninstinct with pride. \"I have made 30,000 to 40,000 prisoners,\" he\r\nwrote on the 17th: \"I have taken 200 cannon, a great number of\r\ngenerals, and destroyed several armies, almost without striking a\r\nblow. I yesterday checked Schwarzenberg's army, which I hope to\r\ndestroy before it recrosses my frontier.\" And two days later, after\r\nhearing the allied terms, he wrote that they would make the blood of\r\nevery Frenchman boil with indignation, and that he would dictate _his_\r\nultimatum at Troyes or Châtillon. Of course, Caulaincourt kept these\r\ndiatribes to himself, but his painfully constrained demeanour betrayed\r\nthe secret that he longed for peace and that his hands were tied.\r\n\r\nOn all sides proofs were to be seen that Napoleon would never give up\r\nBelgium and the Rhine frontier. When the allies (at the suggestion of\r\nSchwarzenberg, and _with the approval of the Czar_) sued for an\r\narmistice, he forbade his envoys to enter into any parleys until the\r\nallies agreed to accept the \"natural frontiers\" as the basis for a\r\npeace, and retired in the meantime on Alsace, Lorraine, and\r\nHolland.[419] These last conditions he agreed three days later to\r\nrelax; but on the first point he was inexorable, and he knew that the\r\nmilitary commissioners appointed to arrange the truce had no power to\r\nagree to the _political_ article which he made a _sine quâ non_.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, no armistice was concluded, and his unbending attitude\r\nmade a bad impression on the Emperor Francis, who, on the 27th,\r\nreplied to his son-in-law in terms which showed that his blows were\r\nwelding the Coalition more firmly together.[420]\r\n\r\nIn fact, while the plenipotentiaries at Châtillon were exchanging\r\nempty demands, a most important compact was taking form at Chaumont:\r\nit was dated from the 1st of March, but definitively signed on the\r\n9th. Great Britain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia thereby bound\r\nthemselves not to treat singly with France for peace, but to continue\r\nthe war until France was brought back to her old frontiers, and the\r\ncomplete independence of Germany, Holland, Switzerland, and Spain was\r\nsecured. Each of the four Powers must maintain 150,000 men in the\r\nfield (exclusive of garrisons); and Britain agreed to aid her allies\r\nwith equal yearly subsidies amounting in all to £5,000,000 for the\r\nyear 1814.[421] The treaty would be only defensive if Napoleon\r\naccepted the allied terms formulated at Châtillon: otherwise it would\r\nbe offensive and hold good, if need be, for twenty years.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly this compact was largely the work of Castlereagh, whose\r\ntact and calmness had done wonders in healing schisms; but so intimate\r\na union could never have been formed among previously discordant\r\nallies but for their overmastering fear of Napoleon. Such a treaty was\r\nwithout parallel in European history; and the stringency of its\r\nclauses serves as the measure of the prowess and perversity of the\r\nFrench Emperor. It is puerile to say, as Mollien does, that England\r\nbribed the allies to this last effort. Experiences of the last months\r\nhad shown them that peace could not be durable as long as Napoleon\r\nremained in a position to threaten Germany. Even now they were ready\r\nto conclude it with Napoleon on the basis of the old frontiers of\r\nFrance, provided that he assented before the 11th of March; but the\r\nmost pacific of their leaders saw that the more they showed their\r\ndesire for peace, the more they strengthened Napoleon's resolve to\r\nhave it only on terms which they saw to be fraught with future\r\ndanger.[422]\r\n\r\nWhile the conferences at Châtillon followed one another in fruitless\r\nsuccession, Blücher, with 48,000 effectives, was once more resuming\r\nthe offensive. Napoleon heard the news at Troyes (February 25th). He\r\nwas surprised at the veteran's temerity: he had pictured him crushed\r\nand helpless beyond Chalons, and had cherished the hope of destroying\r\nSchwarzenberg.--\"If,\" he wrote to Clarke on the morrow, \"I had had a\r\npontoon bridge, the war would be over, and Schwarzenberg's army would\r\nno longer exist.... For want of boats, I could not pass the Seine at\r\nthe necessary points. It was not 50 boats that I needed, only\r\n20.\"--With this characteristic outburst against his War Minister,\r\nwhose neglect to send up twenty boats from Paris had changed the\r\nworld's history, the Emperor turned aside to overwhelm Blücher. The\r\nPrussian commander was near the junction of the Seine and the Aube;\r\nand seemed to offer his flank as unguardedly as three weeks before.\r\n\r\nNapoleon sent Ney, Victor, and Arrighi northwards to fall on his rear,\r\nand on the 27th repaired to Arcis-sur-Aube to direct the operations.\r\nWhat, then, was his annoyance when, in pursuance of the allied plan\r\nformed on the 23rd, Blücher skilfully retired northwards, withdrew\r\nbeyond the Marne and broke the bridges behind him. Then after failing\r\nto drive Marmont and Mortier from Meaux and the line of the Ourcq, the\r\nPrussian leader marched towards Soissons, near which town he expected\r\nto meet the northern army of the allies. For some hours he was in\r\ngrave danger: Marmont hung on his rear, and Napoleon with 35,000 hardy\r\ntroops was preparing to turn his right flank. In fact, had he not\r\nbroken the bridge over the Marne at La Ferté-sous-Jouarre, and thereby\r\ndelayed the Emperor thirty-six hours, he would probably have been\r\ncrushed before he could cross the River Aisne. His men were dead beat\r\nby marching night and day over roads first covered by snow and now\r\ndeep in slush: for a week they had had no regular rations, and great\r\nwas their joy when, at the close of the 2nd, they drew near to the\r\n42,000 troops that Bülow and Winzingerode mustered near the banks of\r\nthe Aisne and Vesle.\r\n\r\nOn that day Napoleon, when delayed at La Ferté, conceived the daring\r\nidea of rushing on the morrow after Blücher, who was \"very embarrassed\r\nin the mire,\" and then of carrying the war into Lorraine, rescuing the\r\ngarrisons of Verdun, Toul, and Metz, and rousing the peasantry of the\r\neast of France against the invaders. It mattered not that\r\nSchwarzenberg had dealt Oudinot and Gérard a severe check at\r\nBar-sur-Aube, as soon as Napoleon's back was turned. That cautious\r\nleader would be certain, he thought, to beat a retreat towards the\r\nRhine as soon as his rear was threatened; and Napoleon pictured France\r\nrising as in 1793, shaking off her invaders and dictating a glorious\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nFar different was the actual situation. Blücher was not to be caught;\r\na sharp frost on the 3rd improved the roads; and his complete junction\r\nwith the northern army was facilitated by the surrender of Soissons on\r\nthat same afternoon. This fourth-rate fortress was ill-prepared to\r\nwithstand an attack; and, after a short bombardment by Winzingerode,\r\ntwo allied officers made their way to the Governor, praised his\r\nbravery, pointed out the uselessness of further resistance, and\r\noffered to allow the garrison to march out with the honours of war and\r\nrejoin the Emperor, where they could fight to more advantage. The\r\nGovernor, who bore the ill-starred name of Moreau, finally gave way,\r\nand his troops, nearly all Poles, marched out at 4 p.m., furious at\r\nhis \"treason\"; for the distant thunder of Marmont's cannon was already\r\nheard on the side of Oulchy. Rumour said that they were the Emperor's\r\ncannon, but rumour lied. At dawn Napoleon's troops had begun to cross\r\nthe temporary bridge over the Marne, thirty-five miles away; but by\r\ngreat exertions his outposts on that evening reached Rocourt, only\r\nsome twenty miles south of Soissons.[423]\r\n\r\nThe fact deserves notice: for it disposes of the strange statement of\r\nThiers that the surrender of Soissons was, next to Waterloo, the most\r\nfatal event in the annals of France. The gifted historian, as also, to\r\nsome extent, M. Houssaye, assumed that, had Soissons held out, Blücher\r\nand Bülow could not have united their forces. But Bülow had not relied\r\nsolely on the bridge at Soissons for the union of the armies; on the\r\n2nd he had thrown a bridge over the Aisne at Vailly, some distance\r\nabove that city, and another on the third near to its eastern\r\nsuburb.[424] It is clear, then, that the two armies, numbering in all\r\nover 100,000 men, could have joined long before Napoleon, Marmont, and\r\nMortier were in a position to attack. Before the Emperor heard of the\r\nsurrender, he had marched to Fismes, and had detached Corbineau to\r\noccupy Rheims, evidently with the aim of cutting Blücher's\r\ncommunications with Schwarzenberg, and opening up the way to Verdun\r\nand Metz.\r\n\r\nFor that plan was now his dominant aim, while the repulse of Blücher\r\nwas chiefly of importance because it would enable him to stretch a\r\nhand eastwards to his beleaguered garrisons.[425] But Blücher was not\r\nto be thus disposed of. While withdrawing from Soissons to the natural\r\nfortress of Laon, he heard that Napoleon had crossed the Aisne at\r\nBerry-au-Bac, and was making for Craonne. Above that town there rises\r\na long narrow ridge or plateau, which Blücher ordered his Russian\r\ncorps to occupy. There was fought one of the bloodiest battles of the\r\nwar (March 7th). The aim of the allies was to await the French attack\r\non the plateau, while 10,000 horsemen and sixty guns worked round and\r\nfell on their rear.\r\n\r\nThe plan failed, owing to a mistake in the line of march of this\r\nflanking force: and the battle resolved itself into a soldiers' fight.\r\nFive times did Ney lead his braves up those slopes, only to be hurled\r\nback by the dogged Muscovites. But the Emperor now arrived; a sixth\r\nattack by the cavalry and artillery of the Guard battered in the\r\ndefence; and Blücher, hearing that the flank move had failed, ordered\r\na retreat on Laon. This confused and desperate fight cost both sides\r\nabout 7,000 men, nearly a fourth of the numbers engaged. Victor,\r\nGrouchy, and six French generals were among the wounded.[426]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Napoleon struggled on: he called up Marmont and Mortier,\r\ngave out that he was about to receive other large reinforcements, and\r\nbade his garrisons in Belgium and Lorraine fall on the rear of the\r\nfoe. One more victory, he thought, would end the war, or at least\r\nlower the demands of the allies. It was not to be. Blücher and Bülow\r\nheld the strong natural citadel of Laon; and all Napoleon's efforts on\r\nMarch the 9th and 10th failed to storm the southern approaches.\r\nMarmont fared no better on the east; and when, at nightfall, the weary\r\nFrench fell back, the Prussians resolved to try a night attack on\r\nMarmont's corps, which was far away from the main body. Never was a\r\nsurprise more successful; Marmont was quite off his guard; horse and\r\nfoot fled in wild confusion, leaving 2,500 prisoners and forty-five\r\ncannon in the hands of the victorious Yorck. Could the allies have\r\npressed home their advantage, the result must have been decisive; but\r\nBlücher had fallen ill, and a halt was called.[427]\r\n\r\nAlone, among the leaders in this campaign, the Emperor remained\r\nunbroken. All the allied leaders had at one time or another bent under\r\nhis blows; and the French Marshals seemed doomed, as in 1813, to fail\r\nwherever their Emperor was not. Ney, Victor, and Mortier had again\r\nevinced few of the qualities of a commander, except bravery. Augereau\r\nwas betraying softness and irresolution in the Lyonnais in front of a\r\nsmaller Austrian force. Suchet and Davoust were shut up in Catalonia\r\nand Hamburg. St. Cyr and Vandamme were prisoners. Soult had kept a\r\nbold front near Bayonne: but now news was to hand that Wellington had\r\nsurprised and routed him at Orthez. On the Seine, Macdonald and\r\nOudinot failed to hold Troyes against the masses of Schwarzenberg. Of\r\nall the French Marshals, Marmont had distinguished himself the most in\r\nthis campaign, and now at Laon he had been caught napping. Yet, while\r\nall others failed, Napoleon seemed invincible. Even after Marmont's\r\ndisaster, the allies forbore to attack the chief; and, just as a lion\r\nthat has been beaten off by a herd of buffaloes stalks away, mangled\r\nbut full of fight and unmolested, so the Emperor drew off in peace\r\ntowards Soissons. Thence he marched on Rheims, gained a victory over a\r\nRussian division there, and hoped to succour his Lorraine garrisons,\r\nwhen, on the 17th, the news of Schwarzenberg's advance towards Paris\r\nled him southwards once more.\r\n\r\nYielding to the remonstrances of the Czar, the Austrian leader had\r\npurposed to march on the French capital, if everything went well; but\r\nhe once more drew back on receiving news of Napoleon's advance against\r\nhis right flank. While preparing to retire towards Brienne, he heard\r\nthat his great antagonist had crossed that river at Plancy with less\r\nthan 20,000 troops. To retrace his steps, fall upon this handful of\r\nweary men with 100,000, and drive them into the river, was not a\r\ndaring conception: but so accustomed were the allies to dalliance and\r\ndelay that a thrill of surprise ran through the host when he began to\r\ncall up its retiring columns for a fight.[428]\r\n\r\nNapoleon also was surprised: he believed the Grand Army to be in full\r\nretreat, and purposed then to dash on Vitry and Verdun.[429] But the\r\nallies gave him plenty of time to draw up Macdonald's and Oudinot's\r\ncorps, while they themselves were still so widely sundered as at first\r\nscarcely to stay his onset. The fighting behind Arcis was desperate:\r\nNapoleon exposed his person freely to snatch victory from the\r\ndeepening masses in front. At one time a shell burst in front of him,\r\nand his staff shivered as they saw his figure disappear in the cloud\r\nof smoke and dust; but he arose unhurt, mounted another charger and\r\npressed on the fight. It was in vain: he was compelled to draw back\r\nhis men to the town (March 20th). On the morrow a bold attack by\r\nSchwarzenberg could have overwhelmed Napoleon's 30,000 men; but his\r\nbold front imposed on the Austrian leader, while the French were drawn\r\nacross the river, only the rearguard suffering heavily from the\r\nbelated attack of the allies. With the loss of 4,000 men, Napoleon\r\nfell back northwards into the wasted plains of Sézanne. Hope now\r\nvanished from every breast but his. And surely if human weakness had\r\never found a place in that fiery soul, it might now have tempted him\r\nto sue for peace. He had flung himself first north, then south, in\r\norder to keep for France the natural frontiers that he might have had\r\nas a present last November; he had failed; and now he might with\r\nhonour accept the terms of the victors. But once more he was too late.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations at Châtillon had ended on March 19th, that is, nine\r\ndays later than had been originally fixed by the allies. The extension\r\nof time was due mainly to their regard and pity for Caulaincourt; and,\r\nindeed, he was in the most pitiable position, a plenipotentiary\r\nwithout full powers, a Minister kept partly in the dark by his\r\nsovereign, and a patriot unable to rescue his beloved France from the\r\nabyss towards which Napoleon's infatuation was hurrying her. He knew\r\nthe resolve of the allies far better than his master's intentions. It\r\nwas from Lord Aberdeen that he heard of the failure of the parleys for\r\nan armistice: from him also he learnt that Napoleon had written a\r\n\"passionate\" letter to Kaiser Francis, and he expressed satisfaction\r\nthat the reply was firm and decided.[430] His private intercourse at\r\nChâtillon with the British plenipotentiaries was frank and friendly,\r\nas also with Stadion. He received frequent letters from Metternich,\r\nadvising him quickly to come to terms with the allies;[431] and the\r\nAustrian Minister sent Prince Esterhazy to warn him that the allies\r\nwould never recede from their demand of the old frontiers for France,\r\nnot even if the fortune of war drove them across the Rhine for a time.\r\n\"Is there, then, no means to enlighten Napoleon as to his true\r\nsituation, or to save him if he persists in destroying himself? Has he\r\nirrevocably staked his own and his son's fate on the last\r\ncannon?\"--Let Napoleon, then, accept the allied proposal by sending a\r\ncounter-project, differing only very slightly from theirs, and peace\r\nwould be made.[432] Caulaincourt needed no spur. \"He works tooth and\r\nnail for a peace,\" wrote Stewart, \"as far as depends on him. He dreads\r\nBonaparte's successes even more than ours, lest they should make him\r\nmore impracticable.\"[433]\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately, his latest and most urgent appeal to the Emperor\r\nreached the latter just after the Pyrrhic victory at Craonne, which\r\nleft him more stubborn than ever. Far from meeting the allies halfway,\r\nhe let fall words that bespoke only injured pride: \"If one must\r\nreceive lashes,\" he said within hearing of the courier, \"it is not for\r\nme to offer my back to them.\" On the morrow he charged Maret to reply\r\nto his distressed plenipotentiary that he (Napoleon) knew best what\r\nthe situation demanded; the demand of the allies that France should\r\nretire within her old frontiers was only their _first word:_\r\nCaulaincourt must get to know their ultimatum: if this was their\r\nultimatum, he must reject it. He (Napoleon) would possibly give up\r\nDutch Brabant and the fortresses of Wesel, Castel (opposite Mainz),\r\nand Kehl, but would make no substantial changes on the Frankfurt\r\nterms. Still, Caulaincourt struggled on. When the session of March\r\n10th was closing, he produced a declaration offering to give up all\r\nNapoleon's claims to control lands beyond the natural limits.\r\n\r\nThe others divined that it was his own handiwork, drawn up in order to\r\nspin out the negotiations and leave his master a few days of\r\ngrace.[434] They respected his intentions, and nine days of grace were\r\ngained; but the only answer that Napoleon vouchsafed to Caulaincourt's\r\nappeals was the missive of March 17th from Rheims: \"I have received\r\nyour letters of the 13th. I charge the Duke of Bassano to answer them\r\nin detail. I give you directly the power to make the concessions which\r\nwould be indispensable to keep up the activity of the negotiations,\r\nand to get to know at last the ultimatum of the allies, it being well\r\nunderstood that the treaty would have for result the evacuation of our\r\nterritory and the release of all prisoners on both sides.\" The\r\ninstructions which he charged the Duke of Bassano to send to\r\nCaulaincourt were such as a victor might have dictated. The allies\r\nmust evacuate his territory and give up all the fortresses as soon as\r\nthe preliminaries of peace were signed: if the negotiations were to\r\nbreak off they had better break off on this question. He himself would\r\ncease to control lands beyond the natural frontiers, and would\r\nrecognize the independence of Holland: as regards Belgium, he would\r\nrefuse to cede it to a prince of the House of Orange, but he hinted\r\nthat it might well go to a French prince as an indemnity--evidently\r\nJoseph Bonaparte was meant. If this concession were made, he expected\r\nthat all the French colonies, including the Ile de France, would be\r\nrestored. Nothing definite was said about the Rhine frontier.\r\n\r\nThe courier who carried these proposals from Rheims to Châtillon was\r\ntwice detained by the Russians, and had not reached the town when the\r\nCongress came to an end (March 19th). Their only importance,\r\ntherefore, is to show that, despite all the warnings in which the\r\nPrague negotiations were so fruitful, Napoleon clung to the same\r\nthreatening and dilatory tactics which had then driven Austria into\r\nthe arms of his foes. He still persisted in looking on the time limit\r\nof the allies as meaningless, on their ultimatum as their _first\r\nword_, from which they would soon shuffle away under the pressure of\r\nhis prowess--and this, too, when Caulaincourt was daily warning him\r\nthat the hours were numbered, that nothing would change the resolve of\r\nhis foes, and that their defeats only increased their exasperation\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nIf anything could have increased this exasperation, it was the\r\ndiscovery that he was playing with them all the time. On the 20th the\r\nallied scouts brought to head-quarters a despatch written by Maret the\r\nday before to Caulaincourt which contained this damning sentence: \"The\r\nEmperor's desires remain entirely vague on everything relating to the\r\ndelivering up of the strongholds, Antwerp, Mayence, and Alessandria,\r\nif you should be obliged to consent to these cessions, as he has the\r\nintention, even after the ratification of the treaty, to take counsel\r\nfrom the military situation of affairs. Wait for the last\r\nmoment.\"[435] Peace, then, was to be patched up for Napoleon's\r\nconvenience and broken by him at the first seasonable opportunity. Is\r\nit surprising that on that same day the Ministers of the Powers\r\ndecided to have no more negotiations with Napoleon, and that\r\nMetternich listened not unfavourably to the emissary of the Bourbons,\r\nthe Count de Vitrolles, whom he had previously kept at arm's length?\r\n\r\nIn truth, Napoleon was now about to stake everything on a plan from\r\nwhich other leaders would have recoiled, but which, in his eyes,\r\npromised a signal triumph. This was to rally the French garrisons in\r\nLorraine and throw himself on Schwarzenberg's rear. It was, indeed,\r\nhis only remaining chance. With his band of barely 40,000 men, kept up\r\nto that number by the arrival of levies that impaired its solidity, he\r\ncould scarcely hope to beat back the dense masses now marshalled\r\nbehind the Aube, the Seine, and the Marne.\r\n\r\nA glance at the map will show that behind those rivers the allies\r\ncould creep up within striking distance of Paris, while from his\r\nposition north of the Aube he could attack them only by crossing one\r\nor other of those great streams, the bridges of which were in their\r\nhands. He still held the central position; but it was robbed of its\r\nvalue if he could not attack. Warfare for him was little else than the\r\nart of swift and decisive attack; or, as he tersely phrased it, \"The\r\nart of war is to march twelve leagues, fight a battle, and march\r\ntwelve more in pursuit.\" As this was now impossible against the fronts\r\nand flanks of the allies, it only remained to threaten the rear of the\r\narmy which was most likely to be intimidated by such a manoeuvre. And\r\nthis was clearly the army led by Schwarzenberg. From Blücher and Bülow\r\nnaught but defiance to the death was to be expected, and their rear\r\nwas supported by the Dutch strongholds.\r\n\r\nBut the Austrians had shown themselves as soft in their strategy as in\r\ntheir diplomacy. Everyone at the allied headquarters knew that\r\nSchwarzenberg was unequal to the load of responsibility thrust on him,\r\nthat the incursion of a band of Alsatian peasants on his convoys made\r\nhim nervous, and that he would not move on Paris as long as his\r\n\"communications were exposed to a movement by Chalons and Vitry.\"[436]\r\nWhat an effect, then, would be produced on that timid commander by an\r\n\"Imperial Vendée\" in Alsace, Lorraine, and Franche-Comté!\r\n\r\nAnd such a rising might then have become fierce and widespread. The\r\neast and centre were the strongholds of French democracy, as they had\r\nbeen the hotbed of feudal and monarchical abuses; and at this very\r\ntime the Bourbon princes declared themselves at Nancy and Bordeaux.\r\nThe tactless Comte d'Artois was at Nancy, striving to whip up royalist\r\nfeeling in Lorraine, and his eldest son, the Duc d'Angoulême, entered\r\nBordeaux with the British red-coats (March 12th).\r\n\r\nTo explain how this last event was possible we must retrace our steps.\r\nAfter Soult was driven by Wellington from the mountains at the back of\r\nthe town of Orthez, he drew back his shattered troops over the River\r\nAdour, and then turned sharply to the east in order to join hands with\r\nSuchet's corps. This move, excellent as it was in a military sense,\r\nleft Bordeaux open to the British; and Wellington forthwith sent\r\nBeresford northwards with 12,000 troops to occupy that great city. He\r\nmet with a warm greeting from the French royalists, as also did the\r\nDuc d'Angoulême, who arrived soon after. The young prince at once\r\nproclaimed Louis XVIII. King of France, and allowed the royalist mayor\r\nto declare that the allies were advancing to Paris merely in order to\r\ndestroy Napoleon and replace him by the rightful monarch. Strongly as\r\nWellington's sympathies ran with the aim of this declaration, he\r\nemphatically repudiated it. Etiquette compelled him to do so; for the\r\nallies were still negotiating with Napoleon; and his own tact warned\r\nhim that the Bourbons must never come into France under the cloak of\r\nthe allies.\r\n\r\nThe allied sovereigns had as yet done nothing to favour their cause;\r\nand the wiser heads among the French royalists saw how desirable it\r\nwas that the initiative should come from France. The bad effects of\r\nthe Bordeaux manifesto were soon seen in the rallying of National\r\nGuards and peasants to the tricolour against the hated _fleur-de-lys;_\r\nand Beresford's men could do little more than hold their own.[437] If\r\nthat was the case in the monarchical south, what might not Napoleon\r\nhope to effect in the east, now that the Bourbon \"chimæra\" threatened\r\nto become a fact?\r\n\r\nThe news as to the state of Paris was less satisfactory. That fickle\r\npopulace cheered royalist allusions at the theatres, hissed off an\r\n\"official\" play that represented Cossack marauders,[438] and caused\r\nsuch alarm to Savary that he wrote to warn his master of the inability\r\nof the police to control the public if the war rolled on towards\r\nParis. Whether Savary's advice was honestly stupid, or whether, as\r\nLavalette hints, Talleyrand's intrigues were undermining his loyalty\r\nto Napoleon, it is difficult to say. But certainly the advice gave\r\nNapoleon an additional reason for flinging himself on Schwarzenberg's\r\nrear and drawing him back into Lorraine. He had reason to hope that\r\nAugereau, reinforced by some of Suchet's troops, would march towards\r\nDijon and threaten the Austrians on the south, while he himself\r\npressed on them from the north-east. In that case, would not Austria\r\nmake peace, and leave Alexander and Blücher at his mercy? And might he\r\nnot hope to cut off the Comte d'Artois, and possibly also catch\r\nBernadotte, who had been angling unsuccessfully for popular support in\r\nthe north-east?\r\n\r\nBut, while basing all his hopes on the devotion of the French\r\npeasantry and the pacific leanings of Austria, the French Emperor left\r\nout of count the eager hatred of the Czar and the Prussians. \"Blücher\r\nwould be mad if he attempted any serious movement,\" so Napoleon wrote\r\nto Berthier on the 20th, apparently on the strength of his former\r\nsuggestion that Joseph should persuade Bernadotte to desert the allies\r\nand attack Blücher's rear.[439] At least, it is difficult to find any\r\nother reason for Napoleon's strange belief that Blücher would sit\r\nstill while his allies were being beaten; unless, indeed, we accept\r\nMarmont's explanation that Napoleon's brain now rejected all\r\nunpleasing news and registered wishes as facts.\r\n\r\nFortune seemed to smile on his enterprise. Though he failed to take\r\nVitry from the allied garrison, yet near St. Dizier he fell on a\r\nPrussian convoy, captured 800 men and 400 wagons filled with stores.\r\nEverywhere he ordered the tocsin to proclaim a _levée en masse_, and\r\nsent messengers to warn his Lorraine garrisons to cut their way to his\r\nside. His light troops spread up the valley of the Marne towards\r\nChaumont, capturing stores and couriers; and he seized this\r\nopportunity, when he pictured the Austrians as thoroughly demoralized,\r\nto send Caulaincourt from Doulevant with offers to renew the\r\nnegotiations for peace (March 25th).[440] But while Napoleon awaits\r\nthe result of these proposals, his rear is attacked: he retraces his\r\nsteps, falls on the assailants, and finds that they belong to Blücher.\r\nBut how can Prussians be there in force? Is not Blücher resting on the\r\nbanks of the Aisne? And where is Schwarzenberg? The Emperor pushes a\r\nforce on to Vitry to solve this riddle, and there the horrible truth\r\nunfolds itself little by little that he stands on the brink of ruin.\r\n\r\nIt is a story instinct with an irony like that of the infatuation of\r\nKing Oedipus in the drama of Sophocles. Every step that the warrior\r\nhas taken to snatch at victory increases the completeness of the\r\ndisaster. The Emperor Francis, scared by the approach of the French\r\nhorsemen, and not wishing to fall into the hands of his son-in-law,\r\nhas withdrawn with Metternich to Dijon.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's letter to him is lost.[441] Metternich, well guarded by\r\nCastlereagh, is powerless to meet Caulaincourt's offer, and their\r\nflight leaves Schwarzenberg under the influence of the Czar.[442]\r\nMoreover, Blücher has not been idle. While Napoleon is hurrying\r\neastwards to Vitry, the Prussian leader drives back Marmont's weak\r\ncorps, his vanguard crosses the Marne near Epernay on the 23rd, his\r\nCossacks capture a courier bearing a letter written on that day by\r\nNapoleon to Marie Louise. It ends thus: \"I have decided to march\r\ntowards the Marne, in order to push the enemy's army further from\r\nParis, and to draw near to my fortresses. I shall be this evening at\r\nSt. Dizier. Adieu, my friend! Embrace my son.\" Warned by this letter\r\nof Napoleon's plan, Blücher pushes on; his outposts on the morrow join\r\nhands with those of Schwarzenberg, and send a thrill of vigour into\r\nthe larger force.\r\n\r\nThat leader, held at bay by Macdonald's rearguard, was groping after\r\nNapoleon, when the capture of a French despatch, and the news\r\nforwarded by Blücher, informed him of the French Emperor's eastward\r\nmarch. A council of war was therefore held at Pougy on the afternoon\r\nof the 23rd, when the Czar and the bolder spirits led Schwarzenberg to\r\ngive up his communications with Switzerland, and stake everything on\r\njoining Blücher, and following Napoleon's 40,000 with an array of\r\n180,000 men. But the capture of another French despatch a few hours\r\nlater altered the course of events once more. This time it was a\r\nbudget of official news from Paris to Napoleon, describing the\r\nexhaustion of the finances, the discontent of the populace, and the\r\nsensation caused by Wellington's successes and the capture of\r\nBordeaux. These glad tidings inspired Alexander with a far more\r\nincisive plan--to march on Paris. This suggestion had been pressed on\r\nhim on the 17th by Baron de Vitrolles, a French royalist agent, at the\r\nclose of a long interview; and now its advantages were obvious.\r\nAccordingly, at Sommepuis, on the 24th, he convoked his generals,\r\nBarclay, Volkonski, Toll, and Diebitsch, to seek their advice. Barclay\r\nwas for following Napoleon, but the two last voted for the advance to\r\nParis, Toll maintaining that only 10,000 horsemen need be left behind\r\nto screen their movements. The Czar signified his warm approval of\r\nthis plan; a little later the King of Prussia gave his assent, and\r\nSchwarzenberg rather doubtfully deferred to their wishes. Thus the\r\nresult of Napoleon's incursion on the rear of the allies signally\r\nbelied his expectations. Instead of compelling the enemy to beat a\r\nretreat on the Rhine, it left the road open to his capital.[443]\r\n\r\nAt dawn on the 25th, then, the allied Grand Army turned to the\r\nright-about, while Blücher's men marched joyfully on the parallel road\r\nfrom Chalons. Near La Fère-Champenoise, on that day, a cloud of\r\nRussian and Austrian horse harassed Marmont's and Mortier's corps, and\r\ntook 2,500 prisoners and fifty cannon. Further to the north, Blücher's\r\nCossacks swooped on a division of 4,500 men, mostly National Guards,\r\nthat guarded a large convoy. Stoutly the French formed in squares, and\r\nbeat them off again and again. Thereupon Colonel Hudson Lowe rode away\r\nsouthwards, to beg reinforcements from Wrede's Bavarians.\r\n\r\nThey, too, failed to break that indomitable infantry. The 180 wagons\r\nhad to be left behind; but the recruits plodded on, and seemed likely\r\nto break through to Marmont, when the Czar came on the scene. At once\r\nhe ordered up artillery, riddled their ranks with grapeshot, and when\r\ntheir commander, Pacthod, still refused to surrender, threatened to\r\noverwhelm their battered squares by the cavalry of his Guard. Pacthod\r\nthereupon ordered his square to surrender. Another band also grounded\r\narms; but the men in the last square fought on, reckless of life, and\r\nwere beaten down by a whirlwind of sabring, stabbing horsemen, whose\r\nfury the generous Czar vainly strove to curb. \"I blushed for my very\r\nnature as a man,\" wrote Colonel Lowe, \"at witnessing this scene of\r\ncarnage.\" The day was glorious for France, but it cost her, in all,\r\nmore than 5,000 killed and wounded, 4,000 prisoners, and 80 cannon,\r\nbesides the provisions and stores designed for Napoleon's army.[444]\r\nNothing but the wreck of Marmont's and Mortier's corps, about 12,000\r\nmen in all, now barred the road to Paris. Meeting with no serious\r\nresistance, the allies crossed the Marne at Meaux, and on the 29th\r\nreached Bondy, within striking distance of the French capital.\r\n\r\nIn that city the people were a prey, first to sheer incredulity, then\r\nto the wildest dismay. To them history was but a melodrama and war a\r\nromance. Never since the time of Jeanne d'Arc had a foreign enemy come\r\nwithin sight of their spires. For ramparts they had octroi walls, and\r\nin place of the death-dealing defiance of 1792 they now showed only\r\nthe spasmodic vehemence or ironical resignation of an over-cultivated\r\nstock. As M. Charles de Rémusat finely remarks on their varying moods,\r\n\"The despotism which makes a constant show of prosperity gives men\r\nlittle fortitude to meet adversity.\" Doubtless the royalists, with\r\nTalleyrand as their factotum, worked to paralyze the defence; but they\r\nformed a small minority, and the masses would have fought for Napoleon\r\nhad he been present to direct everything. But he was far away, rushing\r\nback through Champagne to retrieve his blunder, and in his place they\r\nhad Joseph. The ex-King of Spain was not the man for the hour. He was\r\nno hero to breathe defiance into a bewildered crowd, nor was he well\r\nseconded. Clarke, and Moncey, the commander of the 12,000 National\r\nGuards, had not armed one-half of that doubtful militia. Marmont and\r\nMortier were at hand, and, with the garrison and National Guards,\r\nmustered some 42,000 men.\r\n\r\nBut what were these against the trained host of more than 100,000 men\r\nnow marching against the feeble barriers on the north and east?\r\nMoreover, Joseph and the Council of Regency had dispirited the\r\ndefenders by causing the Empress Regent and the infant King of Rome to\r\nleave the capital along with the treasure. In Joseph's defence it\r\nshould be said that Napoleon had twice warned him to transfer the seat\r\nof Government to the south of the Loire if the allies neared Paris,\r\nand in no case to allow the Empress and the King of Rome to be\r\ncaptured. \"Do not leave the side of my son: I had rather know that he\r\nwas in the Seine than in the hands of the enemies of France.\" The\r\nEmperor's views as to the effect of the capture of Paris were also\r\nwell known. In January he remarked to Mollien, the Minister of the\r\nTreasure, \"My dear fellow, if the enemy reaches the gates of Paris,\r\nthe Empire is no more.\"[445]\r\n\r\nOppressed by these gloomy omens, the defenders awaited the onset of\r\nthe allies at Montreuil, Romainville Pantin, and on the northern plain\r\n(March 30th). At some points French valour held up successfully\r\nagainst the dense masses; but in the afternoon Marmont, seeing his\r\nthin lines overlapped, and in imminent danger of being cut off at\r\nBelleville, sent out a request for a truce, as Joseph had empowered\r\nhim to do if affairs proved to be irretrievable. At all points\r\nresistance was hopeless; Mortier was hard pressed on the north-east;\r\nat the Clichy gate Moncey and his National Guards fought only for\r\nhonour; and so, after a whole day of sanguinary conflicts, the great\r\ncity surrendered on honourable terms.\r\n\r\nAnd thus ended the great impulse which had gone forth from Paris since\r\n1789, which had flooded the plains of Germany, the plateaux of Spain,\r\nthe cities of Italy, and the steppes of Russia, levelling the barriers\r\nof castes and creeds, and binding men in a new and solid unity. The\r\nreaction against that great centrifugal and international movement had\r\nnow become centripetal and profoundly national. Thanks to Napoleon's\r\nstatecraft, the peoples of Europe from the Volga to the Tagus were now\r\nembattled in a mighty phalanx, and were about to enter in triumph the\r\ncity that only twenty-five years before had heralded the dawn of their\r\nnascent liberties.\r\n\r\nAnd what of Napoleon, in part the product and in part the cause, of\r\nthis strange reaction? By a strange Nemesis, his military genius and\r\nhis overweening contempt of Schwarzenberg drew him aside at the very\r\ntime when the allies could strike with deadly effect at the heart of\r\nhis centralized despotism. On the 29th he hears of disaffection at\r\nParis, of the disaster at La Fère Champenoise, and of the loss of\r\nLyons by Augereau. He at once sees the enormity of his blunder. His\r\nweary Guards and he seek to annihilate space. They press on by the\r\nunguarded road by way of Troyes and Fontainebleau, thereby cutting off\r\nall chance of the Emperor Francis and Metternich sending messages from\r\nDijon to Paris. By incredible exertions the men cover seventeen\r\nleagues on the 29th and reach Troyes.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, accompanied by Caulaincourt, Drouot, Flahaut, and Lefebvre,\r\nrushes on, wearing out horses at every stage: at Fontainebleau on the\r\n30th he hears that his consort has left Paris; at Essonne, that the\r\nbattle is raging. Late at night, near Athis, he meets a troop of horse\r\nunder General Belliard: eagerly he questions this brave officer, and\r\nlearns that Joseph has left Paris, and that the battle is over.\r\n\"Forward then to Paris: everywhere where I am not they act\r\nstupidly.\"--\"But, sire,\" says the general, \"it is too late: Paris has\r\ncapitulated.\"\r\n\r\nThe indomitable will is not yet broken. He must go on; he will sound\r\nthe tocsin, rouse the populace, tear up the capitulation, and beat the\r\ninsolent enemy. The sight of Mortier's troops, a little further on, at\r\nlast burns the truth into his brain: he sends on Caulaincourt with\r\nfull powers to treat for peace, and then sits up for the rest of the\r\nnight, poring over his maps and measuring the devotion of his Guard\r\nagainst the inexorable bounds of time and space. He is within ten\r\nmiles of Paris, and sees the glare of the enemy's watch-fires all over\r\nthe northern sky.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow he hears that the allied sovereigns are about to enter\r\nParis, and Marmont warns him by letter that public opinion has much\r\nchanged since the withdrawal, first of the Empress, and then of\r\nJoseph, Louis, and Jerome. This was true. The people were disgusted by\r\ntheir flight; Blücher now had eighty cannon planted on the heights of\r\nMontmartre; and men knew that he would not spare Paris if she hazarded\r\na further effort. And thus, when, on that same morning, the Czar, with\r\nthe King of Prussia on his right, and Schwarzenberg on his left, rode\r\ninto Paris at the head of the Russian and Prussian Guards, they met\r\nwith nothing worse than sullen looks on the part of the masses, while\r\nknots of enthusiastic royalists shouted wildly for the Bourbons, and\r\nwomen flung themselves to kiss the boots of the liberating Emperor.\r\nThe Bourbon party, however, was certainly in the minority; but at\r\nplaces along the route their demonstrations were effective enough to\r\ninfluence an impressionable populace, and to delight the\r\nconquerors.--\"The white cockade appeared very universally:\"--wrote\r\nStewart with suspicious emphasis--\"many of the National Guards, whom I\r\nsaw, wore them.\"[446]\r\n\r\nFearing that the Elysée Palace had been mined, the Czar installed\r\nhimself at Talleyrand's mansion, opposite the Place de la Concorde;\r\nand forthwith there took place a most important private Council. The\r\ntwo monarchs were present, along with Nesselrode and Napoleon's\r\nCorsican enemy, Pozzo di Borgo. Princes Schwarzenberg and Lichtenstein\r\nrepresented Austria; while Talleyrand and Dalberg were there to plead\r\nfor the House of Bourbon: De Pradt and Baron Louis were afterwards\r\nsummoned. The Czar opened the deliberations by declaring that there\r\nwere three courses open, to make peace with Napoleon, to accept Marie\r\nLouise as Regent for her son, or to recall the Bourbons.[447] The\r\nfirst he declared to be impossible; the second was beset by the\r\ngravest difficulties; and, while stating the objections to the\r\nBourbons, he let it be seen that he now favoured this solution,\r\nprovided that it really was the will of France. He then called on\r\nTalleyrand to speak; and that pleader set forth the case of the\r\nBourbons with his usual skill. The French army, he said, was more\r\ndevoted to its own glory than to Napoleon. France longed for peace,\r\nand she could only find it with due sureties under her old dynasty. If\r\nthe populace had not as yet declared for the Bourbons, who could\r\nwonder at that, when the allies persisted in negotiating with\r\nNapoleon? But let them declare that they will no more treat with him,\r\nand France would at once show her real desires. For himself, he would\r\nanswer for the Senate. The Czar was satisfied; Frederick William\r\nassented; the Austrian princes said not a word on behalf of the claims\r\nof Marie Louise; and the cause of the House of Bourbon easily\r\ntriumphed.[448]\r\n\r\nOn the morrow appeared in the \"Journal des Débats\" a decisive\r\nproclamation, signed by Alexander _on behalf of all the allied\r\nPowers;_ but we must be permitted to doubt whether the Emperor\r\nFrancis, if present, would have allowed it to appear, especially if\r\nhis daughter were present in Paris as Regent. The proclamation set\r\nforth that the allies would never again treat with \"Napoleon\r\nBonaparte\" or any member of his family; that they would respect the\r\nintegrity of France as it existed under its lawful kings, and would\r\nrecognize and guarantee the constitution which the French nation\r\nshould adopt.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they invited the Senate at once to appoint a Provisional\r\nGovernment. Talleyrand, as Grand Elector of the Empire, had the power\r\nto summon that guardian of the commonwealth, whose vote would clearly\r\nbe far more expeditious than the _plébiscite_ on which Alexander had\r\npreviously set his heart. Of the 140 Senators only 64 assembled, but\r\nover them Talleyrand's influence was supreme. He spake, and they\r\nsilently registered his suggestions. Thus it was that the august body,\r\ntaught by ten years of despotism to bend gracefully before every\r\nbreeze, fulfilled its last function in the Napoleonic _régime_ by\r\noverthrowing the very constitution which it had been expressly charged\r\nto uphold. The date was the 1st of April. Talleyrand, Dalberg,\r\nBeurnonville, Jaucourt, and l'Abbé de Montesquiou at once formed a\r\nProvisional Government; but the soul of it was Talleyrand. The Czar\r\ngave the word, and Talleyrand acted as scene-shifter. The last tableau\r\nof this constitutional farce was reached on the following day, when\r\nthe Senate and the Corps Législatif declared that Napoleon had ceased\r\nto reign.\r\n\r\nSuch was the ex-bishop's revenge for insults borne for many a year\r\nwith courtly tact, but none the less bitterly felt. Napoleon and he\r\nhad come to regard each other with instinctive antipathy; but while\r\nthe diplomatist hid his hatred under the cloak of irony, the soldier\r\nblurted forth his suspicions. Before leaving Paris, the Emperor had\r\nwound up his last Council-meeting by a diatribe against enemies left\r\nin the citadel; and his words became all the hotter when he saw that\r\nTalleyrand, who was then quietly conversing with Joseph in a corner,\r\ntook no notice of the outburst. From Champagne he sent off an order to\r\nSavary to arrest the ex-Minister, but that functionary took upon\r\nhimself to disregard the order. Probably there was some understanding\r\nbetween them. And thus, after steering past many a rock, the patient\r\nschemer at last helped Europe to shipwreck that mighty adventurer when\r\nbut a league or two from port.\r\n\r\nBut all was not over yet. Napoleon had fallen back on Fontainebleau,\r\nin front of which town he was assembling a force of nearly 60,000 men.\r\nMarie Louise, with the Ministers, was at Blois, and desired to make\r\nher way to the side of her consort. Had she done so, and had her\r\nfather been present at Paris, a very interesting and delicate\r\nsituation would have been the result; and we may fancy that it would\r\nhave needed all Metternich's finesse and Castlereagh's common sense to\r\nkeep the three monarchs united. But Francis was still at Dijon; and\r\nMetternich and Castlereagh did not reach Paris until April 10th; so\r\nthat everything in these important days was decided by the Czar and\r\nTalleyrand, both of them irreconcilable foes of Napoleon. It was in\r\nvain that Caulaincourt (April 1st) begged the Czar to grant peace to\r\nNapoleon on the basis of the old frontiers. \"Peace with him would only\r\nbe a truce,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nThe victor did not repulse the idea of a Regency so absolutely, and\r\nthe faithful Minister at once hurried to Fontainebleau to persuade his\r\nmaster to abdicate in favour of his son. Napoleon repulsed the offer\r\nwith disdain: rather than _that_, he would once more try the hazards\r\nof war. He knew that the Old and the Young Guard, still nearly 9,000\r\nstrong in all, burned to revenge the insult to French pride; and at\r\nthe close of a review held on the 3rd in the great court of the\r\npalace, they shouted, \"To Paris!\" and swore to bury themselves under\r\nits ruins. It needed not the acclaim of his veterans to prompt him to\r\nthe like resolve. When, on April 1st, he received a Verbal Note from\r\nAlexander, stating that the allies would no longer treat with him,\r\nexcept on his private and family concerns, he exclaimed to Marmont, at\r\nthe line of the Essonne, that he must fight, for it was a necessity of\r\nhis position. He also proposed to that Marshal to cross the Seine and\r\nattack the allies, forgetting that the Marne, with its bridges held by\r\nthem, was in the way. Marmont, endowed with a keen and sardonic\r\nintelligence, had already seen that his master was more and more the\r\nvictim of illusions, never crediting the existence of difficulties\r\nthat he did not actually witness. And when, on the 3rd, or perhaps\r\nearlier, offers came from the royalists, the Marshal promised to help\r\nthem in the way that will shortly appear.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's last overtures to the Czar came late on the following day.\r\nOn that morning he had a long and heated discussion with Berthier,\r\nNey, Oudinot, and Lefebvre. Caulaincourt and Maret were present as\r\npeacemakers. The Marshals upbraided Napoleon with the folly of\r\nmarching on Paris. Angered by their words Napoleon at last said: \"The\r\narmy will obey me.\" \"No,\" retorted Ney, \"it will obey its commanders.\"\r\n\r\nMacdonald, who had just arrived with his weary corps, took up their\r\ncase with his usual frankness. \"Our horses,\" he said, \"can go no\r\nfurther: we have not enough ammunition for one skirmish, and no means\r\nof procuring more. If we fail, as we probably shall, the whole of\r\nFrance will be destroyed. We can still impose on the enemy: let us\r\nretain our attitude.... We have had enough of war without kindling\r\ncivil war.\" Finally the Emperor gave way, and drew up a declaration\r\ncouched in these terms: \"The allied Powers having proclaimed that the\r\nEmperor Napoleon was the sole obstacle to the re-establishment of\r\npeace in Europe, the Emperor Napoleon, faithful to his oaths, declares\r\nthat he is ready to descend from the throne, to leave France, and even\r\ngive up his life, for the good of the fatherland, inseparable from the\r\nrights of his son, of those of the regency of the Empress and of the\r\nmaintenance of the laws of the Empire.\"[449]\r\n\r\nA careful reading of this document will show that it was not an act of\r\nabdication, but merely a conditional offer to abdicate, which would\r\nsatisfy those undiplomatic soldiers and gain time. Macdonald also\r\nrelates that, after drawing it up, the Emperor threw himself on the\r\nsofa, struck his thigh, and said: \"Nonsense, gentlemen! let us leave\r\nall that alone and march to-morrow, we shall beat them.\" But they held\r\nhim to his promise; and Caulaincourt, Ney, and Macdonald straightway\r\nproceeding to Paris, beset the Czar with many entreaties and some\r\nthreats to recognize the Regency.\r\n\r\nIn their interview, late at night on the 4th, they seemed to make a\r\ngreat impression, especially when they reminded him of his promise not\r\nto force any government on France. Next, the Czar called in the\r\nmembers of the Provisional Government, and heard their arguments that\r\na Regency must speedily give way before the impact of the one\r\nmasterful will. Yet again Alexander listened to the eloquence of\r\nCaulaincourt, and finally to the pleadings of the now anxious\r\nprovisionals. So the night wore on at Talleyrand's mansion, the Czar\r\nfinally stating that, after hearing the Prussian monarch's advice, he\r\nwould give his decision. And shortly before dawn came the news that\r\nMarmont's corps had marched over to the enemy. \"You see,\" said\r\nAlexander to Pozzo di Borgo, \"it is Providence that wills it: no more\r\ndoubt or hesitation now.\"[450]\r\n\r\nOn that same night, in fact, Marmont's corps of 12,000 men was brought\r\nfrom Essonne within the lines of the allies, by the Marshal's\r\ngenerals. Marmont himself was then in Paris, having been induced by\r\nNey and Macdonald to come with them, so as to hinder the carrying out\r\nof his treasonable design; but his generals, who were in the secret,\r\nwere alarmed by the frequency of Napoleon's couriers, and carried out\r\nthe original plan. Thus, at dawn of the 5th, the rank and file found\r\nthemselves amidst the columns and squadrons of the allies. It was now\r\ntoo late to escape; the men swore at their leaders with helpless fury;\r\nand 12,000 men were thus filched from Napoleon's array.[451]\r\n\r\nIf this conduct be viewed from the personal standpoint, it must be\r\njudged a base betrayal of an old friend and benefactor; and it is\r\nusually regarded in that light alone. And yet Marmont might plead that\r\nhis action was necessary to prevent Napoleon sacrificing his troops,\r\nand perhaps also his capital, to a morbid pride and desire for\r\nrevenge. The Marshal owed something to France. The Chambers had\r\npronounced his master's abdication, and Paris seemed to acquiesce in\r\ntheir decision: Bordeaux and Lyons had now definitely hoisted the\r\nwhite flag: Wellington had triumphed in the south; Schwarzenberg\r\nmarshalled 140,000 men around the capital; and Marmont knew, perhaps,\r\nbetter than any of the Marshals, the obstinacy of that terrible will\r\nwhich had strewn the roads between Moscow, Paris, and Lisbon with a\r\nmillion of corpses. Was it not time that this should end? And would it\r\nend as long as Napoleon saw any chance of snatching a temporary\r\nsuccess?\r\n\r\nHowever we may regard Marmont's conduct, there can be no doubt that it\r\nhelped on Napoleon's fall. The Czar was too subtle a diplomatist to\r\nattach much importance to Napoleon's declaration cited above. He must\r\nhave seen in it a device to gain time. But he himself also wished for\r\na few more hours' respite before flinging away the scabbard; and we\r\nmay regard his lengthy balancings between the pleas of Caulaincourt\r\nand Talleyrand as prompted partly by a wish to sip to the full the\r\nsweets of revenge for the occupation of Moscow, but mainly by the\r\nresolve to mark time until Marmont's corps had been brought over.\r\n\r\nNow that the head was struck off Napoleon's lance, the Czar repulsed\r\nall notion of a Regency, but declared that he was ready to grant\r\ngenerous terms to Napoleon if the latter abdicated outright. \"Now,\r\nwhen he is in trouble,\" he said, \"I will become once more his friend\r\nand will forget the past.\" In conferences with Napoleon's\r\nrepresentatives, Alexander decided that Napoleon must keep the title\r\nof Emperor, and receive a suitable pension. The islands of Corfu,\r\nCorsica, and Elba were considered for his future abode: the last\r\noffered the fewest objections; and though Metternich later on\r\nprotested against the choice of Elba, the Czar felt his honour pledged\r\nto this arrangement.[452]\r\n\r\nNapoleon himself now began to yield to the inevitable. On hearing the\r\nnews of Marmont's defection, he sat for some time as if stupefied,\r\nthen sadly remarked: \"The ungrateful man: well! he will be more\r\nunhappy than I.\" But once more, on the 6th, the fighting instinct\r\ncomes uppermost. He plans to retire with his faithful troops beyond\r\nthe Loire, and rally the corps of Augereau, Suchet, and Soult. \"Come,\"\r\nhe cries to his generals, \"let us march to the Alps.\" Not one of them\r\nspeaks in reply. \"Ah,\" replies the Emperor to their unspoken thoughts;\r\n\"you want repose: have it then. Alas! you know not how many\r\ndisappointments and dangers await you on your beds of down.\" He then\r\nwrote his formal abdication:\r\n\r\n    \"The allied Powers having declared that the Emperor was the sole\r\n    obstacle to the re-establishment of peace in Europe, the Emperor,\r\n    faithful to his oaths, declares that he renounces, for himself and\r\n    his heirs, the thrones of France and Italy, and that there is no\r\n    sacrifice, not even that of life, which he is not ready to make\r\n    for the interest of France.\"\r\n\r\nThe allies made haste to finish the affair; for even now they feared\r\nthat the caged lion would burst his bars. Indeed, the trusty secretary\r\nFain asserts that when on Easter Monday, the 11th, Caulaincourt\r\nbrought back the allies' ratification of this deed, Napoleon's first\r\ndemand was to retract the abdication. It would be unjust, however, to\r\nlay too much stress on this strange conduct; for at that time the\r\nEmperor's mind was partly unhinged by maddening tumults.\r\n\r\nHis anguish increased when he heard the final terms of the allies.\r\nThey allotted to him the isle of Elba; to his consort and heir, the\r\nduchies of Parma, Placentia and Guastalla, and two millions of francs\r\nas an annual subsidy, divided equally between himself and her. They\r\nwere to keep the title of Emperor and Empress; but their son would\r\nbear the name of Duke of Parma, etc. The other Bonapartes received an\r\nannual subsidy of 2,500,000 francs, this and the former sum being paid\r\nby France. Four hundred soldiers might accompany him to Elba. A\r\n\"suitable establishment\" was to be provided for Eugène outside of\r\nFrance.[453] For some hours Napoleon refused to ratify this compact.\r\nAll hope of resistance was vain, for Oudinot, Victor, Lefebvre, and,\r\nfinally, Ney and Berthier, had gone over to the royalists: even the\r\nsoldiery began to waver. But a noble pride held back the mighty\r\nconqueror from accepting Elba and signing a money compact. It is not\r\nwithout a struggle that a Cæsar sinks to the level of a Sancho Panza.\r\n\r\nHe then talked to Caulaincourt with the insight that always illumined\r\nhis judgments. Marie Louise ought to have Tuscany, he said: Parma\r\nwould not befit her dignity. Besides, if she had to traverse other\r\nStates to come to him, would she ever do so? He next talked of his\r\nMarshals. Masséna's were the greatest exploits: but Suchet had shown\r\nhimself the wisest both in war and administration. Soult was able, but\r\ntoo ambitious. Berthier was honest, sensible, the model of a chief of\r\nthe staff; and \"yet he has now caused me much pain.\" Not a word\r\nescaped him about Davoust, still manfully struggling at Hamburg. Not\r\none of his Ministers, he complained, had come from Blois to bid him\r\nfarewell. He then spoke of his greatest enemy--England. \"She has done\r\nme much harm, doubtless, but I have left in her flanks a poisoned\r\ndart. It is I who have made this debt, that will ever burden, if not\r\ncrush, future generations.\" Finally, he came back to the hateful\r\ncompact which Caulaincourt pressed him in vain to sign. How could he\r\ntake money from the allies. How could he leave France so small, after\r\nreceiving her so great!\r\n\r\nThat same night he sought to end his life. On February the 8th he had\r\nwarned his brother Joseph that he would do so if Paris were captured.\r\nDuring the retreat from Moscow he had carried about a phial which was\r\nsaid to contain opium, and he now sought to end his miseries. But\r\nCaulaincourt, his valet Constant, and the surgeon Ivan were soon at\r\nhand with such slight cures as were possible. After violent sickness\r\nthe Emperor sank into deep prostration; but, when refreshed by tea,\r\nand by the cool air of dawning day, he gradually revived. \"Fate has\r\ndecided,\" he exclaimed: \"I must live and await all that Providence has\r\nin store for me.\"[454] He then signed the treaty with the allies,\r\npresented Macdonald with the sword of Murad Bey, and calmly began to\r\nprepare for his departure.\r\n\r\nMarie Louise did not come to see him. Her decision to do so was\r\noverruled by her father, in obedience to whose behests she repaired\r\nfrom Blois to Rambouillet.\r\n\r\nThere, guarded by Cossacks, she saw Francis, Alexander, and Frederick\r\nWilliam in turn. What passed between them is not known: but the result\r\nwas that, on April 23rd, she set out for Vienna, whence she finally\r\nrepaired to Parma; she manifested no great desire to see her consort\r\nat Elba, but soon consoled herself with the Count de Neipperg.\r\n\r\nNo doubts as to her future conduct, no qualms of conscience as to the\r\ndestiny of France now ruffled Napoleon's mind. Like a sky cleared by a\r\nthunderstorm, once more it shone forth with clear radiance. Those who\r\nsaw him now were astonished at his calmness, except in some moments\r\nwhen he declaimed at his wife and child being kept from him by\r\nAustrian schemes. Then he stormed and wept and declared that he would\r\nseek refuge in England, which General Köller, the Austrian\r\ncommissioner appointed to escort him to Elba, strongly advised him to\r\ndo. But for the most part he showed remarkable composure. When Bausset\r\nsought to soothe him by remarking that France would still form one of\r\nthe finest of realms, he replied: \"_with remarkable serenity_--'I\r\nabdicate and I yield nothing.'\"[455] The words hide a world of\r\nmeaning: they inclose the secret of the Hundred Days.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th, he bade farewell to his Guard: in thrilling words he told\r\nthem that his mission thenceforth would be to describe to posterity\r\nthe wonders they had achieved: he then embraced General Petit, kissed\r\nthe war-stained banner, and, wafted on his way by the sobs of these\r\nunconquered heroes, set forth for the Mediterranean. In the central\r\ndistricts, and as far as Lyons, he was often greeted by the well-known\r\nshouts, but, further south, the temper of the people changed.\r\n\r\nAt Orange they cursed him to his face, and hurled stones at the\r\nwindows of the carriage; Napoleon, protected by Bertrand, sat huddled\r\nup in the corner, \"apparently very much frightened.\" After forcing a\r\nway through the rabble, the Emperor, when at a safe distance, donned a\r\nplain great coat, a Russian cloak, and a plain round hat with a white\r\ncockade: in this or similar disguises he sought to escape notice at\r\nevery village or town, evincing, says the British Commissioner,\r\nColonel Campbell, \"much anxiety to save his life.\"\r\n\r\nBy a détour he skirted the town of Avignon, where the mob thirsted for\r\nhis blood; and by another device he disappointed the people of Orgon,\r\nwho had prepared an effigy of him in uniform, smeared with blood, and\r\nplacarded with the words: \"Voilà donc l'odieux tyran! Tôt ou tard le\r\ncrime est puni.\"[456] In this humiliating way he hurried on towards\r\nthe coast, where a British frigate, the \"Undaunted,\" was waiting for\r\nhim. There some suspicious delays ensued, which aroused the fears of\r\nthe allied commissioners, especially as bands of French soldiers began\r\nto draw near after the break-up of Eugène's army.[457]\r\n\r\nAt last, on the 28th, accompanied by Counts Bertrand and Drouot, he\r\nset sail from Fréjus. It was less than fifteen years since he had\r\nlanded there crowned with the halo of his oriental adventures.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nELBA AND PARIS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it be an advantage to pause in the midst of the rush of life and\r\ntake one's bearings afresh, then Napoleon was fortunate in being\r\ndrifted to the quiet eddy of Elba. He there had leisure to review his\r\ncareer, to note where he had served his generation and succeeded,\r\nwhere also he had dashed himself fruitlessly against the fundamental\r\ninstincts of mankind. Undoubtedly he did essay this mental\r\nstock-taking. He remarked to the conscientious Drouot that he was\r\nwrong in not making peace at the Congress of Prague; that trust in his\r\nown genius and in his soldiery led him astray; \"but those who blame me\r\nhave never drunk of Fortune's intoxicating cup.\" When a turn of her\r\nwheel brought him uppermost again, he confessed that at Elba he had\r\nheard, as in a tomb, the verdict of posterity; and there are signs\r\nthat his maturer convictions thenceforth strove to curb the old\r\ndomineering instincts that had wrecked his life.\r\n\r\nIntrospection, however, was alien to his being; he was made for the\r\ncamp rather than the study; his critical powers, if turned in for a\r\ntime on himself, quickly swung back to work upon men and affairs; and\r\nthey found the needed exercise in organizing his Liliputian Empire and\r\nsurveying the course of European politics. In the first weeks he was\r\nup at dawn, walking or riding about Porto Ferrajo and its environs,\r\nplanning better defences, or tracing out new roads and avenues of\r\nmulberry trees. \"I have never seen a man,\" wrote Campbell, \"with so\r\nmuch activity and restless perseverance: he appears to take pleasure\r\nin perpetual movement, and in seeing those who accompany him sink\r\nunder fatigue.\" About seven hundred of his Guards were brought over on\r\nBritish transports; and these, along with Corsicans and Tuscans,\r\nguarded him against royalist plotters, real or supposed. In a short\r\ntime he purchased a few small vessels, and annexed the islet of\r\nPianosa. These affairs and the formation of an Imperial Court for the\r\ndelectation of his mother and his sister Pauline, who now joined him,\r\nserved to drive away ennui; but he bitterly resented the Emperor\r\nFrancis's refusal to let his wife and son come to him. Whether Marie\r\nLouise would have come is more than doubtful, for her relations to\r\nCount Neipperg were already notorious; but the detention of his son\r\nwas a heartless action that aroused general sympathy for the lonely\r\nman. The Countess Walewska paid him a visit for some days, bringing\r\nthe son whom she had borne him.[458]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Europe was settling down uneasily on its new political\r\nfoundations. Considering that France had been at the mercy of the\r\nallies, she had few just grounds of complaint against them. The\r\nTreaties of Paris (May 30th, 1814) left her with rather wider bounds\r\nthan those of 1791; and she kept the art treasures reft by Napoleon.\r\nPerfidious Albion yielded up all her French colonial conquests, except\r\nMauritius, Tobago, and St. Lucia. Britons grumbled at the paltry gains\r\nbrought by a war that had cost more than £600,000,000: but Castlereagh\r\njustified the policy of conciliation. \"It is better,\" said he, \"for\r\nFrance to be commercial and pacific than a warlike and conquering\r\nState.\" We insisted on her ceding Belgium to the House of Orange,\r\nwhile we retained the Dutch colonies conquered by us, the Cape,\r\nDemerara, and Curaçoa--paying £6,000,000 for them.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the Netherlands, the Rhineland, and Italy galled French\r\npride. Loud were the murmurs of the throngs of soldiers that came from\r\nthe fortresses of Germany, or the prisons of Spain, Russia, and\r\nEngland--70,000 crossed over from our shores alone--at the harshness\r\nof the allies and the pusillanimity of the Bourbons. The return from\r\nwar to peace is always hard; and now these gaunt warriors came back to\r\na little France that perforce discharged them or placed them on\r\nhalf-pay. Perhaps they might have been won over by a tactful Court:\r\nbut the Bourbons, especially that typical _émigré_, the Comte\r\nd'Artois, were nothing if not tactless, witness their shelving of the\r\nOld Guard and formation of the Maison du Roi, a privileged and highly\r\npaid corps of 6,000 nobles and royalist gentlemen. The peasants, too,\r\nwere uneasy, especially those who held the lands of nobles confiscated\r\nin the Revolution. To indemnify the former owners was impossible in\r\nface of the torrent of exorbitant claims that flowed in. And the year\r\n1814, which began as a soul-stirring epic, ended with sordid squabbles\r\nworthy of a third-rate farce.\r\n\r\nMoreover, at this very time, the former allies seemed on the brink of\r\nwar. The limits of our space admit only of the briefest glance at the\r\ndisputes of the Powers at the Congress of Vienna. The storm centre of\r\nEurope was the figure of the Czar. To our ambassador at Vienna, Sir\r\nCharles Stewart, he declared his resolve to keep western Poland and\r\nnever to give up 7,000,000 of his \"Polish subjects.\"[459] Strange to\r\nsay, he ultimately gained the assent of Prussia to this objectionable\r\nscheme, provided that she acquired the whole of Saxony, while\r\nFrederick Augustus was to be transplanted to the Rhineland with Bonn\r\nas capital. To these proposals Austria, England, and France offered\r\nstern opposition, and framed a secret compact (January 3rd, 1815) to\r\nresist them, if need be, with armies amounting to 450,000 men. But,\r\nthough swords were rattled in their scabbards, they were not drawn.\r\nWhen news reached Vienna of the activity of Bonapartists in France and\r\nof Murat in Italy, the Powers agreed (February 8th) to the\r\nSaxon-Polish compromise which took shape in the map of Eastern Europe.\r\nThe territorial arrangements in the west were evidently inspired by\r\nthe wish to build up bulwarks against France. Belgium was tacked on to\r\nHolland; Germany was huddled into a Confederation, in which the\r\nprinces had complete sovereign powers; and the Kingdom of Sardinia\r\ngrew to more than its former bulk by recovering Savoy and Nice and\r\ngaining Genoa.\r\n\r\nThis piling up of artificial barriers against some future Napoleon was\r\nto serve the designs of the illustrious exile himself. The instinct of\r\nnationality, which his blows had aroused to full vigour, was now\r\noutraged by the sovereigns whom it carried along to victory. Belgians\r\nstrongly objected to Dutch rule, and German \"Unitarians,\" as\r\nMetternich dubbed them, spurned a form of union which subjected the\r\nFatherland to Austria and her henchmen. Hardest of all was the fate of\r\nItaly. After learning the secret of her essential unity under\r\nNapoleon, she was now parcelled out among her former rulers; and\r\nthrills of rage shot through the peninsula when the Hapsburgs settled\r\ndown at Venice and Milan, while their scions took up the reins at\r\nModena, Parma, and Florence.\r\n\r\nIt was on this popular indignation that Murat now built his hopes.\r\nAfter throwing over Napoleon, he had looked to find favour with the\r\nallies; but his movements in 1814 had been so suspicious that the fate\r\nof his kingdom remained hanging in the balance. The Bourbons of Paris\r\nand Madrid strove hard to effect his overthrow; but Austria and\r\nEngland, having tied their hands early in 1814 by treaties with him,\r\ncould only wait and watch in the hope that the impetuous soldier would\r\ntake a false step. He did so in February, 1815, when he levied forces,\r\nsummoned Louis XVIII. to declare whether he was at war with him, and\r\nprepared to march into Northern Italy.\r\n\r\nThe disturbed state of the peninsula caused the Powers much uneasiness\r\nas to the presence of Napoleon at Elba. Louis XVIII. in his\r\ndespatches, and Talleyrand in private conversations, two or three\r\ntimes urged his removal to the Azores; but, with the exception of\r\nCastlereagh, who gave a doubtful assent, the plenipotentiaries scouted\r\nthe thought of it. Metternich entirely opposed it, and the Czar would\r\ncertainly have objected to the reversal of his Elba plan, had\r\nTalleyrand made a formal proposal to that effect. But he did not do\r\nso. The official records of the Congress contain not a word on the\r\nsubject. Equally unfounded were the newspaper rumours that the\r\nCongress was considering the advisability of removing Napoleon to St.\r\nHelena. On this topic the official records are also silent; and we\r\nhave the explicit denial of the Duke of Wellington (who reached Vienna\r\non the 1st of February to relieve Castlereagh) that \"the Congress ever\r\nhad any intention of removing Bonaparte from Elba to St. Helena.\"[460]\r\n\r\nNapoleon's position was certainly one of unstable equilibrium, that\r\ntended towards some daring enterprise or inglorious bankruptcy. The\r\nmaintenance of his troops cost him more than 1,000,000 francs a year,\r\nwhile his revenue was less than half of that sum. He ought to have\r\nreceived 2,000,000 francs a year from Louis XVIII.; but that monarch,\r\nwhile confiscating the property of the Bonapartes in France, paid not\r\na centime of the sums which the allies had pledged him to pay to the\r\nfallen House. Both the Czar and our envoy, Castlereagh, warmly\r\nreproached Talleyrand with his master's shabby conduct; to which the\r\nplenipotentiary replied that it was dangerous to furnish Napoleon with\r\nmoney as long as Italy was in so disturbed a state. Castlereagh, on\r\nhis return to England by way of Paris, again pressed the matter on\r\nLouis XVIII., who promised to take the matter in hand. But he was soon\r\nquit of it: for, as he wrote to Talleyrand on March 7th, Bonaparte's\r\nlanding in France _spared him the trouble_.[461]\r\n\r\nTo assert, however, that Napoleon's escape from Elba was prompted by a\r\ndesire to avoid bankruptcy, is to credit him with respectable\r\n_bourgeois_ scruples by which he was never troubled. Though \"Madame\r\nMère\" and Pauline complained bitterly to Campbell of the lack of funds\r\nat Elba, the Emperor himself was far from depressed. \"His spirits seem\r\nof late,\" wrote Campbell on December 28th, \"rather to rise, and not to\r\nyield in the smallest degree to the pressure of pecuniary\r\ndifficulties.\" Both Campbell and Lord John Russell, who then paid the\r\nEmperor a flying visit, thought that he was planning some great move,\r\nand warned our Ministers.[462] But they shared the view of other\r\nwiseacres, that Italy would be his goal, and that too, when Campbell's\r\ndespatches teemed with remarks made to him by Napoleon as to the\r\ncertainty of an outbreak in France. Here are two of them:\r\n\r\n    He said that there would be a violent outbreak, similar to the\r\n    Revolution, in consequence of their present humiliation: every man\r\n    in France considers the Rhine to be the natural frontier of\r\n    France, and nothing can alter this opinion. If the spirit of the\r\n    nation is roused into action nothing can oppose it. It is like a\r\n    torrent.... The present Government of France is too feeble: the\r\n    Bourbons should make war as soon as possible so as to establish\r\n    themselves upon the throne. It would not be difficult to recover\r\n    Belgium. It is only for the British troops there that the French\r\n    army has the smallest awe\" (_sic_).\r\n\r\nHis final resolve to put everything to the hazard was formed about\r\nFebruary 13th, when, shortly after receiving tidings as to the unrest\r\nin Italy, the discords of the Powers, and the resolve of the allied\r\nsovereigns to leave Vienna on the 20th, he heard news of the highest\r\nimportance from France. On that day one of his former officials,\r\nFleury de Chaboulon, landed in Elba, and informed him of the hatching\r\nof a plot by military malcontents, under the lead of Fouché, for the\r\noverthrow of Louis XVIII.[463] Napoleon at once despatched his\r\ninformant to Naples, and ordered his brig, \"L'Inconstant,\" to be\r\npainted like an English vessel. Most fortunately for him, Campbell on\r\nthe 16th set sail for Tuscany--\"for his health and on private\r\naffairs\"--on the small war-vessel, \"Partridge,\" to which the British\r\nGovernment had intrusted the supervision of Napoleon. Captain Adye, of\r\nthat vessel, promised, after taking Campbell to Leghorn, to return and\r\ncruise off Elba. He called at Porto Ferrajo on the 24th, and to\r\nBertrand's question, when he was to bring Campbell back, returned the\r\nundiplomatic answer that it was fixed for the 26th. The news seems to\r\nhave decided Napoleon to escape on that day, when the \"Partridge\"\r\nwould be absent at Leghorn. Meanwhile Campbell, alarmed by the news of\r\nthe preparations at Elba, was sending off a request to Genoa that\r\nanother British warship should be sent to frustrate the designs of the\r\n\"restless villain.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was now too late. On that Sunday night at 9 p.m., the Emperor,\r\nwith 1,050 officers and men, embarked at Porto Ferrajo on the\r\n\"Inconstant\" and six smaller craft. Favoured by the light airs that\r\ndetained the British vessel, his flotilla glided away northwards; and\r\nnot before the 28th did Adye and Campbell find that the imperial eagle\r\nhad flown. Meanwhile Napoleon had eluded the French guard-ship,\r\n\"Fleur-de-Lys,\" and ordered his vessels to scatter. On doubling the\r\nnorth of Corsica, he fell in with another French cruiser, the\r\n\"Zephyr,\" which hailed his brig and inquired how the great man was.\r\n\"Marvellously well,\" came the reply, suggested by Napoleon himself to\r\nhis captain. The royalist cruiser passed on contented. And thus,\r\nthanks to the imbecility of the old Governments and of their servants,\r\nNapoleon was able to land his little force safely in the Golfe de\r\nJouan on the afternoon of March 1st.[464] Is it surprising that\r\nforeigners, who had not yet fathomed the eccentricities of British\r\nofficialdom, should have believed that we connived at Napoleon's\r\nescape? It needed the blood shed at Waterloo to wipe out the\r\nmisconception.\r\n\r\n\"I shall reach Paris without firing a shot.\" Such was the prophecy of\r\nNapoleon to his rather questioning followers as they neared the coast\r\nof Provence. It seemed the wildest of dreams. Could the man, who had\r\nbeen wellnigh murdered by the rabble of Avignon and Orgon, hope to\r\nmarch in peace through that royalist province? And, if he ever reached\r\nthe central districts where men loved him better, would the soldiery\r\ndare to disobey the commands of Soult, the new Minister of War, of\r\nNey, Berthier, Macdonald, St. Cyr, Suchet, Augereau, and of many more\r\nwho were now honestly serving the Bourbons? The King and his brothers\r\nhad no fears. They laughed at the folly of this rash intruder.\r\n\r\nAt first their confidence seemed justified. Napoleon's overtures to\r\nthe officer and garrison of Antibes were repulsed, and the small\r\ndetachment which he sent there was captured. Undaunted by this check,\r\nhe decided to hurry on by way of Grasse towards Grenoble, thus\r\nforestalling the news of his first failure, and avoiding the royalist\r\ndistricts of the lower Rhone.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was visibly perturbed as he drew near to Grenoble. There the\r\nofficer in command, General Marchand, had threatened to exterminate\r\nthis \"band of brigands\"; and his soldiers as yet showed no signs of\r\ndefection. But, by some bad management, only one battalion held the\r\ndefile of Laffray on the south. As the bear-skins of the Guard came in\r\nsight, the royalist ranks swerved and drew back. Then the Emperor came\r\nforward, and ordered his men to lower their arms. \"There he is: fire\r\non him,\" cried a royalist officer. Not a shot rang out.--\"Soldiers,\"\r\nsaid the well-known voice, \"if there is one among you who wishes to\r\nkill his Emperor, he can do so. Here I am.\" At once a great shout of\r\n\"Vive l'Empereur\" burst forth: and the battalion broke into an\r\nenthusiastic rush towards the idol of the soldiery.\r\n\r\nThat scene decided the whole course of events. A little later, a young\r\nnoble, Labédoyère, leads over his regiment; at Grenoble the garrison\r\nstands looking on and cheering while the Bonapartists batter in the\r\ngates; and the hero is borne in amidst a whirlwind of cheers. At\r\nLyons, the Comte d'Artois and Macdonald seek safety in flight; and\r\nsoldiers and workmen welcome their chief with wild acclaim; but amidst\r\nthe wonted cries are heard threats of \"The Bourbons to the\r\nguillotine,\" \"Down with the priests!\"\r\n\r\nThe shouts were ominous: they showed that the Jacobins meant to use\r\nNapoleon merely as a tool for the overthrow of the Bourbons. The\r\n\"have-nots\" cheered him, but the \"haves\" shivered at his coming, for\r\nevery thinking man knew that it implied war with Europe.[465] Napoleon\r\nsaw the danger of relying merely on malcontents and sought to arouse a\r\ntruly national feeling. He therefore on March 13th issued a series of\r\npopular decrees, that declared the rule of the Bourbons at an end,\r\ndissolved the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, and summoned the\r\n\"electoral colleges\" of the Empire to a great assembly, or Champ de\r\nMai, at Paris. He further proscribed the white flag, ordered the\r\nwearing of the tri-colour cockade, disbanded the hated \"Maison du\r\nRoi,\" abolished feudal titles, and sequestered the domains of the\r\nBourbon princes. In brief, he acted as the Bonaparte of 1799. He then\r\nset forth for Paris, at the head of 14,000 men.\r\n\r\nNey was at the same time marching with 6,000 men from Besançon. He had\r\nlately assured Louis XVIII. that Napoleon deserved to be brought to\r\nParis in an iron cage. But now his soldiers kept a sullen silence. At\r\nBourg the leading regiment deserted; and while beset by difficulties,\r\nthe Marshal received from Napoleon the assurance that he would be\r\nreceived as he was on the day after the Moskwa (Borodino). This was\r\nenough. He drew his troops around him, and, to their lively joy,\r\ndeclared for the Emperor (March 14th). Napoleon was as good as his\r\nword. Never prone to petty malice, he now received with equal\r\ngraciousness those officers who flung themselves at his feet, and\r\nthose who staunchly served the King to the very last. Before this\r\nsunny magnanimity the last hopes of the Bourbons melted away. Greeted\r\non all sides by soldiers and peasants, the enchanter advances on\r\nParis, whence the King and Court beat a hasty retreat towards Lille.\r\n\r\nCrowds of peasants line and almost block the road from Fontainebleau\r\nto catch a glimpse of the gray coat; and, to expedite matters, he\r\ndrives on in a cabriolet with his faithful Caulaincourt. Escorted by a\r\ncavalcade of officers he enters Paris after nightfall; but there the\r\ntone of the public is cool and questioning, until the front of the\r\nTuileries facing the river is reached.[466] Then a mighty shout arises\r\nfrom the throng of jubilant half-pay officers as the well-known figure\r\nalights: he passes in, and is half carried up the grand staircase,\r\n\"his eyes half closed,\" says Lavalette, \"his hands extended before him\r\nlike a blind man, and expressing his joy only by a smile.\" Ladies are\r\nthere also, who have spent the weary hours of waiting in stripping off\r\n_fleurs-de-lys_, and gleefully exposing the N's and golden bees\r\nconcealed by cheap Bourbon upholstery. Anon they fly back to this\r\ntask; the palace wears its wonted look; and the brief spell of Bourbon\r\nrule seems gone for ever.\r\n\r\nTo his contemporaries this triumph of Napoleon appeared a miracle\r\nbefore which the voice of criticism must be dumb. And yet, if we\r\nremember the hollowness of the Bourbon restoration, the tactlessness\r\nof the princes and the greed of their partisans, it seems strange that\r\nthe house of cards reared by the Czar and Talleyrand remained standing\r\neven for eleven months. Napoleon correctly described the condition of\r\nFrance when he said to his comrades on the \"Inconstant\": \"There is no\r\nhistoric example that induces me to venture on this bold enterprise:\r\nbut I have taken into account the surprise that will seize on men, the\r\nstate of public feeling, the resentment against the allies, the love\r\nof my soldiers, in fine, all the Napoleonic elements that still\r\ngerminate in our beautiful France.\"[467]\r\n\r\nStill less was he deceived by the seemingly overwhelming impulse in\r\nhis favour. He looked beyond the hysteria of welcome to the cold and\r\ncritical fit which follows; and he saw danger ahead. When Mollien\r\ncomplimented him on his return, he replied, alluding to the general\r\nindifference at the departure of the Bourbons: \"My dear fellow! People\r\nhave let me come, just as they let the others go.\" The remark reveals\r\nkeen insight into the workings of French public opinion. The whole\r\ncourse of the Revolution had shown how easy it was to destroy a\r\nGovernment, how difficult to rebuild. In truth, the events of March,\r\n1815, may be called the epilogue of the revolutionary drama. The royal\r\nHouse had offended the two most powerful of French interests, the\r\nmilitary and the agrarian, so that soldiers and peasants clutched\r\neagerly at Napoleon as a mighty lever for its overthrow.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor wisely formed his Ministry before the first enthusiasm\r\ncooled down. Maret again became Secretary of State; Decrès took the\r\nNavy; Gaudin the finances; Mollien was coaxed back to the Treasury,\r\nand Davoust reluctantly accepted the Ministry of War. Savary declined\r\nto be burdened with the Police, and Napoleon did not press him: for\r\nthat clever intriguer, Fouché, was pointed out as the only man who\r\ncould rally the Jacobins around the imperial throne: to him, then,\r\nNapoleon assigned this important post, though fully aware that in his\r\nhands it was a two-edged tool. Carnot was finally persuaded to become\r\nMinister for Home Affairs.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's fate, however, was to be decided, not at Paris, but by the\r\nstatesmen assembled at Vienna. There time was hanging somewhat\r\nheavily, and the news of Napoleon's escape was welcomed at first as a\r\ngrateful diversion. Talleyrand asserted that Napoleon would aim at\r\nItaly, but Metternich at once remarked: \"He will make straight for\r\nParis.\" When this prophecy proved to be alarmingly true, a drastic\r\nmethod was adopted to save the Bourbons. The plenipotentiaries drew up\r\na declaration that Bonaparte, having broken the compact which\r\nestablished him at Elba--the only legal title attaching to his\r\nexistence--had placed himself outside the bounds of civil and social\r\nrelations, and, as an enemy and disturber of the peace of the world,\r\nwas consigned to \"public prosecution\" (March 13th).[468] The rigour of\r\nthis decree has been generally condemned. But, after all, it did not\r\nexceed in harshness Napoleon's own act of proscription against Stein;\r\nit was a desperate attempt to stop the flight of the imperial eagle to\r\nParis and to save France from war with Europe.\r\n\r\nPublic considerations were doubtless commingled with the promptings of\r\npersonal hatred. We are assured that Talleyrand was the author of this\r\ndeclaration, which had the complete approval of the Czar. But Napoleon\r\nhad one enemy more powerful than Alexander, more insidious than\r\nTalleyrand, and that was--his own past. Everywhere the spectre of war\r\nrose up before the imagination of men. The merchant pictured his ships\r\nswept off by privateers: the peasant saw his homestead desolate: the\r\nhousewife dreamt of her larder emptied by taxes, and sons carried off\r\nfor the war. At Berlin, wrote Jackson, all was agitation, and\r\neverybody said that _the work of last year would have to be done over\r\nagain_.\r\n\r\nIn England the current of public feeling was somewhat weakened by the\r\ndrifts and eddies of party politics. Many of the Whigs made a popular\r\nhero of Napoleon, some from a desire to overthrow the Liverpool\r\nMinistry that proscribed him; others because they believed, or tried\r\nto believe, that the return of Napoleon concerned only France, and\r\nthat he would leave Europe alone if Europe left him alone. Others\r\nthere were again, as Hazlitt, who could not ignore the patent fact\r\nthat Napoleon was an international personage and had violated a\r\nEuropean compact, yet nevertheless longed for his triumph over the bad\r\nold Governments and did not trouble much as to what would come next.\r\nBut, on the whole, the judgment of well-informed people may be summed\r\nup in the conclusion of that keen lawyer, Crabb Robinson: \"The\r\nquestion is, peace with Bonaparte now, or war with him in Germany two\r\nyears hence.\"[469] The matter came to a test on April 28th, when\r\nWhitbread's motion against war was rejected by 273 to 72.[470]\r\n\r\nIf that was the general opinion in days when Ministers and\r\ndiplomatists alone knew the secrets of the game, it was certain that\r\nthe initiated, who remembered his wrongheaded refusals to make peace\r\neven in the depressing days of 1814, would strive to crush him before\r\nhe could gather all his strength. In vain did he protest that he had\r\nlearnt by sad experience and was a changed man. They interpreted his\r\npacific speeches by their experience of his actions; and thus his\r\noverweening conduct in the past blotted out all hope of his crowning a\r\nromantic career by a peaceful and benignant close. The declaration of\r\noutlawry was followed, on March 25th, by the conclusion of treaties\r\nbetween the Powers, which virtually renewed those framed at Chaumont.\r\nIn quick succession the smaller States gave in their adhesion; and\r\nthus the coalition which tact and diplomacy had dissolved was\r\nrevivified by the fears which the mighty warrior aroused. Napoleon\r\nmade several efforts to sow distrust among the Powers; and chance\r\nplaced in his hands a veritable apple of discord.\r\n\r\nThe Bourbons in their hasty flight from Paris had left behind several\r\nState papers, among them being the recent secret compact against\r\nRussia and Prussia. Napoleon promptly sent this document to the Czar\r\nat Vienna; but his hopes of sundering the allies were soon blighted.\r\nThough Alexander and Metternich had for months refused to exchange a\r\nword or a look, yet the news of Napoleon's adventure brought about a\r\nspeedy reconciliation; and when the compromising paper from Paris was\r\nplaced in the Czar's hands, he took the noble revenge of sending for\r\nMetternich, casting it into the fire, and adjuring the Minister to\r\nforget recent disputes in the presence of their common enemy. Napoleon\r\nstrove to detach Austria from the Coalition, as did also Fouché on his\r\nown account; but the overtures led to no noteworthy result, except\r\nthat Napoleon, on finding out Fouché's intrigue, threatened to have\r\nhim shot--a threat which that necessary tool treated with quiet\r\nderision.\r\n\r\nA few acts of war occurred at once; but Austria and Russia pressed for\r\ndelay, the latter with the view of overthrowing Murat. That potentate\r\nnow drew the sword on behalf of Napoleon, and summoned the Italians to\r\nstruggle for their independence. But he was quickly overpowered at\r\nTolentino (May 3rd), and fled from his kingdom, disguised as a sailor,\r\nto Toulon. There he offered his sword to Napoleon; but the Emperor\r\nrefused his offer and blamed him severely, alleging that he had\r\ncompromised the fortunes of France by rendering peace impossible. The\r\ncharge must be pronounced not proven. The allies had taken their\r\nresolve to destroy Napoleon on March 13th, and Murat's adventure\r\nmerely postponed the final struggle for a month or so.\r\n\r\nNapoleon used this time of respite to form his army and stamp out\r\nopposition in France. The French royalist bands gave him little\r\ntrouble. In the south-west the _fleur-de-lys_ was speedily beaten\r\ndown; but in La Vendée royalism had its roots deep-seated. Headed by\r\nthe two Larochejacqueleins, the peasants made a brave fight; and\r\n20,000 regulars failed to break them up until the month of June was\r\nwearing on. What might not those 20,000 men, detained in La Vendée,\r\nhave effected on the crest of Waterloo?\r\n\r\nNapoleon's preoccupation, however, was the conduct of the Jacobins in\r\nFrance, who had been quickened to immense energy by the absurdities of\r\nthe royalist reaction and felt that they had the new ruler in their\r\npower. A game of skill ensued, which took up the greater part of the\r\n\"Hundred Days\" of Napoleon's second reign. His conduct proved that he\r\nwas not sure of success. He felt out of touch with this new\r\nliberty-loving France, so different from the passively devoted people\r\nwhom he had left in 1814; he bridled his impetuous nature, reasoning\r\nwith men, inviting criticism, and suggesting doubts as to his own\r\nproposals, in a way that contrasted curiously with the old\r\nsledge-hammer methods.\r\n\r\n    \"He seemed,\" writes Mollien, \"habitually calm, pensive, and\r\n    preserved without affectation a serious dignity, with little of\r\n    that old audacity and self-confidence which had never met with\r\n    insuperable obstacles.... As his thoughts were cramped in a narrow\r\n    space girt with precipices instead of soaring freely over a vast\r\n    horizon of power, they became laborious and\r\n\r\nThis Pegasus in harness chafed at the unwonted yoke; and at times the\r\nold instincts showed themselves. On one occasion, when the subject\r\nturned on the new passion for liberty, he said to Lavalette with a\r\nquestion in his voice: \"All this will last two or three years?\" \"Your\r\nMajesty,\" replied the Minister, \"must not believe that. It will last\r\nfor ever.\"\r\n\r\nThe first grave difficulty was to frame a constitution, especially as\r\nhis Lyons decrees led men to believe that it would emanate from the\r\npeople, and be sanctioned by them in a great _Champ de Mai_. Perhaps\r\nthis was impossible. A great part of France was a prey to civil\r\nstrifes; and it was a skilful device to intrust the drafting of a\r\nconstitution to Benjamin Constant.\r\n\r\nThis brilliant writer and talker had now run through the whole gamut\r\nof political professions. A pronounced Jacobin and free-thinker during\r\nthe Consulate, he subsequently retired to Germany, where he unlearnt\r\nhis politics, his religion, and his philosophy. The sight of\r\nNapoleon's devastations made him a supporter of the throne and altar,\r\ncompelled him to recast his treatises, and drove him to consort with\r\nthe quaint circle of pietists who prayed and grovelled with Madame de\r\nKrudener. Returning to France at the Restoration, he wielded his\r\nfacile pen in the cause of the monarchy, and fluttered after the\r\nfading charms of Madame Récamier, confiding to his friend, De Broglie,\r\nthat he knew not whether to trust most to divine or satanic agencies\r\nfor success in this lawless chase. In March, 1815, he thundered in the\r\nPress against the brigand of Elba--until the latter won him over in\r\nthe space of a brief interview, and persuaded him to draft, with a few\r\ncolleagues, the final constitution of the age.\r\n\r\nNot that Constant had a free hand: he worked under imperial\r\ninspiration. The present effort was named the Additional\r\nAct--additional, that is, to the Constitutions of the Empire (April\r\n22nd, 1815). It established a Chamber of Peers nominated by Napoleon,\r\nwith hereditary rights, and a Chamber of Representatives elected on\r\nthe plan devised in August, 1802. The Emperor was to nominate all the\r\njudges, including the _juges de paix;_ the jury system was maintained,\r\nand liberty of the Press was granted. The Chambers also gained\r\nsomewhat wider control over the Ministers.[471]\r\n\r\nThis Act called forth a hail of criticisms. When the Council of State\r\npointed out that there was no guarantee against confiscations,\r\nNapoleon's eyes flashed fire, and he burst forth:\r\n\r\n    \"You are pushing me in a way that is not mine. You are weakening\r\n    and chaining me. France looks for me and does not find me. Public\r\n    opinion was excellent: now it is execrable. France is asking what\r\n    has come to the Emperor's arm, this arm which she needs to master\r\n    Europe. Why speak to me of goodness, abstract justice, and of\r\n    natural laws? The first law is necessity: the first justice is the\r\n    public safety.\"\r\n\r\nThe councillors quailed under this tirade and conceded the\r\npoint--though we may here remark that Napoleon showed a wise clemency\r\ntowards his foes, and confiscated the estates of only thirteen of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion became more and more \"execrable.\" Some historians have\r\nasserted that the decline of Napoleon's popularity was due, not to the\r\nAdditional Act, but to the menaces of war from a united Europe: this\r\nmay be doubted. Miot de Melito, who was working for the Emperor in the\r\nWest, states that \"never had a political error more immediate effects\"\r\nthan that Act; and Lavalette, always a devoted adherent, asserts\r\nThat Frenchmen thenceforth \"saw only a despot in the Emperor and forgot\r\nabout the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nAs a display of military enthusiasm, the _Champ de Mai_, of June 1st,\r\nrecalled the palmy days gone by. Veterans and conscripts hailed their\r\nchief with jubilant acclaim, as with a few burning words he handed\r\nthem their eagles. But the people on the outskirts cheered only when\r\nthe troops cheered. Why should they, or the \"electors\" of France,\r\ncheer? They had hoped to give her a constitution; and they were now\r\nmerely witnesses to Napoleon's oath that he would obey the\r\nconstitution of his own making. As a civic festival, it was a mockery\r\nin the eyes of men who remembered the \"Feast of Pikes,\" and were not\r\nto be dazzled by the waving of banners and the gorgeous costumes of\r\nNapoleon and his brothers. The opening of the Chambers six days later\r\ngave an outlet to the general discontent. The report that Napoleon\r\ndesigned his brother Lucien for the Presidency of the Lower House is\r\nincorrect. That honest democrat Lanjuinais was elected. Everything\r\nportended a constitutional crisis, when the summons to arms rang\r\nforth; and the chief, warning the deputies not to imitate the Greeks\r\nof the late Empire by discussing abstract propositions while the\r\nbattering-ram thundered at their gates, cut short these barren debates\r\nby that appeal to the sword which had rarely belied his hopes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nLIGNY AND QUATRE BRAS\r\n\r\n\r\nA less determined optimist than Napoleon might well have hoped for\r\nsuccess over the forces of the new coalition. True, they seemed\r\noverwhelmingly great. But many a coalition had crumbled away under the\r\nalchemy of his statecraft; and the jealousies that had raged at the\r\nCongress of Vienna inspired the hope that Austria, and perhaps\r\nEngland, might speedily be detached from their present allies. Strange\r\nas it seems to us, the French people opined that Napoleon's escape\r\nfrom Elba was due to the connivance of the British Government; and\r\nCaptain Mercer states that, even at Waterloo, many of the French clung\r\nto the belief that the British resistance would be a matter of form.\r\nNapoleon cherished no such illusion: but he certainly hoped to\r\nsurprise the British and Prussian forces in Belgium, and to sever at\r\none blow an alliance which he judged to be ill cemented. Thereafter he\r\nwould separate Austria from Russia, a task that was certainly possible\r\nif victory crowned the French eagles.[472]\r\n\r\nHis military position was far stronger than it had been since the\r\nMoscow campaign. The loss of Germany and Spain had really added to his\r\npower. No longer were his veterans shut up in the fortresses of Europe\r\nfrom Danzig to Antwerp, from Hamburg to Ragusa; and the Peninsular War\r\nno longer engulfed great armies of his choicest troops. In the eyes of\r\nFrenchmen he was not beaten in 1814; he was only tripped up by a\r\ntraitor when on the point of crushing his foes. And, now that peace\r\nhad brought back garrisons and prisoners of war, as many as 180,000\r\nwell-trained troops were ranged under the imperial eagles. He hoped by\r\nthe end of June to have half a million of devoted soldiers ready for\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties that beset him were enough to daunt any mind but his.\r\nSome of the most experienced Marshals were no longer at his side. St.\r\nCyr, Macdonald, Oudinot, Victor, Marmont, and Augereau remained true\r\nto Louis XVIII. Berthier, on hearing of Napoleon's return from Elba,\r\nforthwith retired into Germany, and, in a fit of frenzy, threw himself\r\nfrom the window of a house in Bamberg while a Russian corps was\r\npassing through that town. Junot had lost his reason. Masséna and\r\nMoncey were too old for campaigning; Mortier fell ill before the first\r\nshots were fired. Worst of all, the unending task of army organization\r\ndetained Davoust at Paris. Certainly he worked wonders there; but, as\r\nin 1813 and 1814, Napoleon had cause to regret the absence of a\r\nlieutenant equally remarkable for his acuteness of perception and\r\ndoggedness of purpose, for a good fortune that rarely failed, and a\r\ndevotion that never faltered. Doubtless it was this last priceless\r\nquality, as well as his organizing gifts, that marked him out as the\r\nideal Minister of War and Governor of Paris. Besides him he left a\r\nCouncil charged with the government during his absence, composed of\r\nPrinces Joseph and Lucien and the Ministers.\r\n\r\nBut, though the French army of 1815 lacked some of the names far famed\r\nin story, numbers of zealous and able officers were ready to take\r\ntheir place. The first and second corps were respectively assigned to\r\nDrouet, Count d'Erlon, and Reille, the former of whom was the son of\r\nthe postmaster of Varennes, who stopped Louis XVI.'s flight. Vandamme\r\ncommanded the third corps; Gérard, the fourth; Rapp, the fifth; while\r\nthe sixth fell to Mouton, better known as Count Lobau. Rapp's corps\r\nwas charged with the defence of Alsace; other forces, led by Brune,\r\nDecaen, and Clausel, protected the southern borders, while Suchet\r\nguarded the Alps; but the rest of these corps were gradually drawn\r\ntogether towards the north of France, and the addition of the Guard,\r\n20,800 strong, brought the total of this army to 125,000 men.\r\n\r\nThere was one post which the Emperor found it most difficult to fill,\r\nthat of Chief of the Staff. There the loss of Berthier was\r\nirreparable. While lacking powers of initiative, he had the faculty of\r\nlucidly and quickly drafting Napoleon's orders, which insures the\r\nsmooth working of the military machine. Who should succeed this\r\nskilful and methodical officer? After long hesitation Napoleon chose\r\nSoult. In a military sense the choice was excellent. The Duke of\r\nDalmatia had a glorious military record; in his nature activity was\r\nblended with caution, ardour with method; but he had little experience\r\nof the special duties now required of him; and his orders were neither\r\ndrafted so clearly nor transmitted so promptly as those of Berthier.\r\n\r\nThe concentration of this great force proceeded with surprising\r\nswiftness; and, in order to lull his foes into confidence, the Emperor\r\ndelayed his departure from Paris to the last moment possible. As dawn\r\nwas flushing the eastern sky, on June 12th, he left his couch, after\r\nfour hours' sleep, entered his landau, and speedily left his\r\nslumbering capital behind. In twelve hours he was at Laon. There he\r\nfound that Grouchy's four cavalry brigades were not sharing in the\r\ngeneral advance owing to Soult's neglect to send the necessary orders.\r\nThe horsemen were at once hurried on, several regiments covering\r\ntwenty leagues at a stretch and exhausting their steeds. On the 14th\r\nthe army was well in hand around Beaumont, within striking distance of\r\nthe Prussian vanguard, from which it was separated by a screen of\r\ndense woods. There the Emperor mounted his charger and rode along the\r\nranks, raising such a storm of cheers that he vainly called out: \"Not\r\nso loud, my children, the enemy will hear you.\" There, too, on this\r\nanniversary of Marengo and Friedland, he inspired his men by a\r\nstirring appeal on behalf of the independence of Poles, Italians, the\r\nsmaller German States, and, above all, of France herself. \"For every\r\nFrenchman of spirit the time has come to conquer or die.\"\r\n\r\nWhat, meanwhile, was the position of the allies? An Austro-Sardinian\r\nforce threatened the south-east of France. Mighty armies of 170,000\r\nRussians and 250,000 Austrians were rolling slowly on towards Lorraine\r\nand Alsace respectively; 120,000 Prussians, under Blücher, were\r\ncantoned between Liège and Charleroi; while Wellington's composite\r\narray of British, German, and Dutch-Belgian troops, about 100,000\r\nstrong, lay between Brussels and Mons.[473] The original plan of these\r\ntwo famous leaders was to push on rapidly into France; but the\r\ncautious influences of the Military Council sitting at Vienna\r\nprevailed, and it was finally decided not to open the campaign until\r\nthe Austrians and Russians should approach the frontiers of France.\r\nEven as late as June 15th we find Wellington writing to the Czar in\r\nterms that assume a co-operation of all the allies in simultaneous\r\nmoves towards Paris--movements which Schwarzenberg had led him to\r\nexpect _would begin about the 20th of June_.[474]\r\n\r\nFrom this prolonged and methodical warfare Europe was saved by\r\nNapoleon's vigorous offensive. His political instincts impelled him to\r\nstrike at Brussels, where he hoped that the populace would declare for\r\nunion with France and severance from the detested Dutch. In this war\r\nhe must not only conquer armies, he must win over public opinion; and\r\nhow could he gain it so well as in the guise of a popular liberator?\r\n\r\nBut there were other advantages to be gained in Belgium. By flinging\r\nhimself on Wellington and the Prussians, and driving them asunder, he\r\nwould compel Louis XVIII. to another undignified flight; and he would\r\ndisorganize the best prepared armies of his foes, and gain the\r\nmaterial resources of the Low Countries. He seems even to have\r\ncherished the hope that a victory over Wellington would dispirit the\r\nBritish Government, unseat the Ministry, and install in power the\r\npeace-loving Whigs.\r\n\r\nAnd this victory was almost within his grasp. While his host drew near\r\nto the Prussian outposts south of Charleroi and Thuin, the allies were\r\nstill spread out in cantonments that extended over one hundred miles,\r\nnamely, from Liège on Blücher's left to Audenarde on Wellington's\r\nright. This wide dispersion of troops, when an enterprising foe was\r\nknown to be almost within striking distance, has been generally\r\ncondemned. Thus General Kennedy, in his admirable description of\r\nWaterloo, admits that there was an \"absurd extension\" of the\r\ncantonments. Wellington, however, was bound to wait and to watch the\r\nthree good high-roads, by any one of which Napoleon might advance,\r\nnamely, those of Tournay, Mons, and Charleroi. The Duke had other\r\ncauses for extending his lines far to the west: he desired to cover\r\nthe roads from Ostend, whence he was expecting reinforcements, and to\r\nstretch a protecting wing over the King of France at Ghent.\r\n\r\nThere are many proofs, however, that Wellington was surprised by\r\nNapoleon. The narratives of Sir Hussey Vivian and Captain Mercer show\r\nthat the final orders for our advance were carried out with a haste\r\nand flurry that would not have happened if the army had been well in\r\nhand, or if Wellington had been fully informed of Napoleon's latest\r\nmoves.[475] There is a wild story that the Duke was duped by Fouché,\r\non whom he was relying for news from Paris. But it seems far more\r\nlikely that he was misled by the tidings sent to Louis XVIII. at Ghent\r\nby zealous royalists in France, the general purport of which was that\r\nNapoleon _would wage a defensive campaign_.[476] On the 13th June,\r\nWellington wrote: \"I have accounts  from Paris of the 10th, on which\r\nday he [Bonaparte] was still there; and I judge from his speech to\r\nthe Legislature that his departure was not likely to be immediate.\r\nI think we are now too strong for him here.\" And, in later years, he\r\ntold Earl Stanhope that Napoleon \"was certainly wrong in attacking\r\nat all\"; for the allied armies must soon have been in great straits\r\nfor want of food if they had advanced into France, exhausted as she\r\nwas by the campaign of 1814. \"But,\" he added, \"the fact is,\r\nBonaparte never in his life had patience for a defensive war.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF THE WATERLOO\r\nCAMPAIGN]\r\n\r\nThe Duke's forces would, at the outset of the campaign, have been in\r\nless danger, if the leaders at the Prussian outposts, Pirch II. and\r\nDörnberg of the King's German Legion, had warned him of the enemy's\r\nmassing near the Sambre early on the 15th. By some mischance this was\r\nnot done; and our leader only heard from Hardinge, at the Prussian\r\nheadquarters, that the enemy seemed about to begin the offensive. He\r\ntherefore waited for more definite news before concentrating upon any\r\none line.\r\n\r\nAbout 6 p.m. on the 15th he ordered his divisions and brigades to\r\nconcentrate at Vilvorde, Brussels, Ninove, Grammont, Ath,\r\nBraine-le-Comte, Hal, and Nivelles--the first four of which were\r\nsomewhat remote, while the others were chosen with a view to defending\r\nthe roads leading northwards from Mons. Not a single British brigade\r\nwas posted on the Waterloo-Charleroi road, which was at that time\r\nguarded only by a Dutch-Belgian division, a fact which supports Mr.\r\nRopes's contention that no definite plan of co-operation had been\r\nformed by the allied leaders. Or, if there was one, the Duke certainly\r\nrefused to act upon it until he had satisfied himself that the chief\r\nattack was not by way of Mons or Ath. More definite news reached\r\nBrussels near midnight of the 15th, whereupon he gave a general left\r\nturn to his advance, namely, _towards Nivelles_.\r\n\r\nClausewitz maintains that he should already have removed his\r\nheadquarters to Nivelles; had he done so and hurried up all available\r\ntroops towards the Soignies-Quatre Bras line, his Waterloo fame would\r\ncertainly have gained in solidity. A dash of romance was added by his\r\nattending the Duchess of Richmond's ball at Brussels on the night of\r\nthe 15th-16th; lovers of the picturesque will always linger over the\r\nscene that followed with its \"hurrying to and fro and tremblings of\r\ndistress\"; but the more prosaic inquirer may doubt whether Wellington\r\nshould not then have been more to the front, feeling every throb of\r\nBellona's pulse.[477]\r\n\r\nBlücher's army, comprising 90,000 men, also covered a great stretch of\r\ncountry. The first corps, that of Ziethen, held the bridges of the\r\nSambre at and near Charleroi; but the corps of Pirch I. and Thielmann\r\nwere at Namur and Ciney; while, owing to a lack of stringency in the\r\norders sent by Gneisenau, chief of the staff, to Bülow, his corps of\r\n32,000 men was still at Liège. Early on the 15th, Pirch I. and\r\nThielmann began hastily to advance towards Sombref; and Ziethen, with\r\n32,000 men, prepared to hold the line of the Sambre as long as\r\npossible. His chief of staff, General Reiche, states that one-third of\r\nthe Prussians were new troops, drafted in from the Landwehr; but all\r\nthe corps gloried in their veteran Field-Marshal, and were eager to\r\nfight.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was the general position. Wellington was unaware of his\r\ndanger; Blücher was straining every nerve to get his army together;\r\nwhile 32,000 Prussians were exposed to the attack of nearly four times\r\ntheir number. It is clear that, had all gone well with the French\r\nadvance, the fortunes of Wellington and Blücher must have been\r\ndesperate. But, though the concentration of 125,000 French troops near\r\nBeaumont and Maubeuge had been effected with masterly skill (except\r\nthat Gérard's and D'Erlon's corps were late), the final moves did not\r\nwork quite smoothly. An accident to the officer who was to order\r\nVandamme's corps to march at 2 a.m. on the 15th caused a long delay to\r\nthat eager fighter.[478] The 4th corps, that of Gérard, was also\r\ndisturbed and delayed by an untoward event. General Bourmont, whose\r\nold Vendéan opinions seemed to have melted away completely before the\r\nsun of Napoleon's glory, rewarded his master by deserting with several\r\nofficers to the Prussians, very early on that morning. The incident\r\nwas really of far less importance than is assigned to it in the St.\r\nHelena Memoirs, which falsely ascribe it to the 14th: the Prussians\r\nwere already on the _qui vive_ before Bourmont's desertion; but it\r\nclogged the advance of Gérard's corps and fostered distrust among the\r\nrank and file. When, on the morrow, Gérard rejoined his chief at the\r\nmill of Fleurus, the latter reminded him that he had answered for\r\nBourmont's fidelity with his own head; and, on the general protesting\r\nthat he had seen Bourmont fight with the utmost devotion, Napoleon\r\nreplied: \"Bah! A man who has been a white will never become a blue:\r\nand a blue will never be a white.\" Significant words, that show the\r\nEmperor's belief in the ineradicable strength of instinct and early\r\ntraining.[479]\r\n\r\nDespite these two mishaps, the French on the morning of the 15th\r\nsucceeded in driving Ziethen's men from the banks of the Sambre about\r\nThuin, while Napoleon in person broke through their line at Charleroi.\r\nAfter suffering rather severely, the defenders fell back on Gilly,\r\nwhither Napoleon and his main force followed them; while the left wing\r\nof the French advance, now intrusted to Ney, was swung forward against\r\nthe all-important position of Quatre Bras.\r\n\r\nWe here approach one of the knotty questions of the campaign. Why did\r\nnot Ney occupy the cross-roads in force on the evening of the 15th? We\r\nmay note first that not till the 11th had Napoleon thought fit to\r\nsummon Ney to the army, so that the Marshal did not come up till the\r\nafternoon of this very day. He at once had an interview with the\r\nEmperor, who, according to General Gourgaud, gave the Marshal verbal\r\norders to take command of the corps of Reille and D'Erlon, to push on\r\nnorthwards, take up a position at Quatre Bras, and throw out advanced\r\nposts beyond on the Brussels and Namur roads; but it seems unlikely\r\nthat the Emperor would have given one of the most venturesome of his\r\nMarshals an absolute order to push on so far in advance, unless the\r\nFrench right wing had driven the Prussians back beyond the Sombref\r\nposition. Otherwise, Ney would have been dangerously far in advance of\r\nthe main body and exposed to blows either from the Prussians or the\r\nBritish.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, Ney certainly felt insecure, and did not push on\r\nwith his wonted dash; while, fortunately for the allies, an officer\r\nwas at hand Prince Bernard of Saxe-Weimar, who saw the need of holding\r\nQuatre Bras at all costs.[480] The young leader imposed on the foe by\r\nmaking the most of his men--they were but 4,500 all told, and had only\r\nten bullets apiece--and he succeeded. For once, Ney was prudent to a\r\nfault, and did not push home the attack. In his excuse it may be said\r\nthat the men of Reille's corps, on whom he had to rely--for D'Erlon's\r\ncorps was still far to the rear--had been marching and fighting ever\r\nsince dawn, and were too weary for another battle. Moreover, the roar\r\nof cannon on the south-east warned him that the right wing of the\r\nFrench advance was hotly engaged between Gilly and Fleurus; until it\r\nbeat back the Prussians, his own position was dangerously \"in the\r\nair\"; and, as but two hours of daylight remained, he drew back on\r\nFrasnes. He is also said to have sent word to the Emperor that \"he was\r\noccupying Quatre Bras by an advanced guard, and that his main body was\r\nclose behind.\" If he deceived his chief by any such report, he\r\ndeserves the severest censure; but the words quoted above were written\r\nlater at St. Helena by General Gourgaud, when Ney had come to figure\r\nas the scapegoat of the campaign.[481] Ney sent in a report on that\r\nevening; but it has been lost.[482] Judging from the orders issued by\r\nNapoleon and Soult early on the 16th, there was much uncertainty as to\r\nNey's position. The Emperor's letter bids him post his first division\r\n\"two leagues in front of les Quatres Chemins\"; but Soult's letter to\r\nGrouchy states that Ney is ordered _to advance to the cross-roads_.\r\nConfusion was to be expected from the circumstances of the case. Ney\r\ndid not know his staff-officers, and he hastily took command of the\r\nleft wing when in the midst of operations whose success, as Janin\r\npoints out, largely depended on that of the right. He therefore played\r\na cautious game, when, as we now know, caution meant failure and\r\ndaring spelt safety.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the French right wing, of which Grouchy had received the\r\ncommand, though Napoleon in person was its moving force, had been\r\npressing the Prussians hard near Gilly. Yet here, too, the assailants\r\nwere weakened by the absence of the corps of Vandamme and Gérard.\r\nIrritated by Ziethen's skilful withdrawal, the Emperor at last\r\nlaunched his cavalry at the Prussian rear battalions, four of which\r\nwere severely handled before they reached the covert of a wood. With\r\nthe loss, on the whole, of nearly 2,000 men, the Prussians fell back\r\ntowards Ligny, while Grouchy's vanguard bivouacked near the village of\r\nFleurus.\r\n\r\nNapoleon might well be satisfied with the work done on June 15th: he\r\nrode back to his headquarters at Charleroi, \"exhausted with fatigue,\"\r\nafter spending wellnigh eighteen hours in the saddle, but confident\r\nthat he had sundered the allies. This was certainly his aim now, as it\r\nhad been in the campaign of 1796. After two decisive blows at their\r\npoints of connection, he purposed driving them on divergent lines of\r\nretreat, just as he had driven the Austrians and Sardinians down the\r\nroads that bifurcate near Montenotte. True, there were in Belgium no\r\nmountain spurs to prevent their reunion; but the roads on which they\r\nwere operating were far more widely divergent.[483] He also thought\r\nlightly of Wellington and Blücher. The former he had pronounced\r\n\"incapable and unwise\"; as for Blücher, he told Campbell at Elba that\r\nhe was \"no general\"; but that he admired the pluck with which \"the old\r\ndevil\" came on again after a thrashing.\r\n\r\nUnclouded confidence is seen in every phrase of the letters that he\r\npenned at Charleroi early on the 16th. He informs Ney that he intends\r\nsoon to attack the Prussians at Sombref, _if he finds them there_, to\r\nclear the road as far as Gembloux, and then to decide on his further\r\nactions as the case demands. Meanwhile Ney is to sweep the road in\r\nfront of Quatre Bras, placing his first division two leagues beyond\r\nthat position, if it seemed desirable, with a view to marching on\r\nBrussels during the night with his whole force of about 50,000 men.\r\nThe Guard is to be kept in reserve as much as possible, so as to\r\nsupport either Napoleon on the Gembloux road, or Ney on the Brussels\r\nroad; and \"if any skirmish takes place with the English, it is\r\npreferable that the work should fall on the Line rather than on the\r\nGuard.\" As for the Prussian resistance, Napoleon rated it almost as\r\nlightly as that of the English; for he regards it as probable that he\r\nwill in the evening _march on Brussels with his Guard_.\r\n\r\nWhile he pictured his enemies hopelessly scattered or in retreat, they\r\nwere beginning to muster at the very points which he believed to be\r\nwithin his grasp. At 11 a.m. only Ziethen's corps, now but 28,000\r\nstrong, was in position at Sombref, but the corps of Pirch I. and\r\nThielmann came up shortly after midday. Had Napoleon pushed on early\r\non the 16th, he must easily have gained the Ligny-Sombref position.\r\nWhat, then, caused the delay in the French attack? It can be traced to\r\nthe slowness of Gérard's advance, to the Emperor's misconception of\r\nthe situation, and to his despatch to Grouchy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF LIGNY.]\r\n\r\nIn this he reckoned the Prussians at\r\n40,000 men, and ordered Grouchy to repair with the French right wing\r\nto Sombref.\r\n\r\n    \" ... I shall be at Fleurus between 10 and 11 a.m.: I shall\r\n    proceed to Sombref, leaving my Guard, both infantry and cavalry,\r\n    at Fleurus: I would not take it to Sombref, unless it should be\r\n    necessary. If the enemy is at Sombref, I mean to attack him: I\r\n    mean to attack him even at Gembloux, and to gain this position\r\n    also, my aim being, after having known about these two positions,\r\n    to set out to-night, and to operate with my left wing, under the\r\n    command of Marshal Ney, against the English.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor did not reach Fleurus until close on 11 a.m., and was\r\nundoubtedly taken aback to find Grouchy still there, held in check by\r\nthe enemy strongly posted around Ligny. Grouchy has been blamed for\r\nnot having already attacked them; but surely his orders bound him to\r\nwait for the Emperor before giving battle: besides, the corps of\r\nGérard, which had been assigned to him was still far away in the rear\r\ntowards Châtelet.[484] The absence of Gérard, and the uncertainty as\r\nto the enemy's aims, annoyed the Emperor. He mounted the windmill\r\nsituated on the outskirts of Fleurus to survey the enemy's position.\r\n\r\nIt was a fair scene that lay before him. Straight in front ran the\r\nhigh-road which joined the Namur-Nivelles _chaussée_, some six miles\r\naway to the north-east. On either side stretched cornfields, whose\r\nrichness bore witness alike to the toils and the warlike passions of\r\nmankind. Further ahead might be seen the dark lines of the enemy\r\nranged along slopes that formed an irregular amphitheatre, dotted with\r\nthe villages of Bry and Sombref. In the middle distance, from out a\r\nhollow that lay concealed, rose the steeples and a few of the higher\r\nroofs of Ligny. Further to the left and on higher ground lay St.\r\nAmand, with its outlying hamlets. All was bathed in the shimmering,\r\nsultry heat of midsummer, the harbinger, as it proved, of a violent\r\nthunderstorm. The Prussian position was really stronger than it\r\nseemed. Napoleon could not fully see either the osier beds that\r\nfringed the Ligny brook, or its steep banks, or the many strong\r\nbuildings of Ligny itself. He saw the Prussians on the slope behind\r\nthe village, and was at first puzzled by their exposed position. \"The\r\nold fox keeps to earth,\" he was heard to mutter. And so he waited\r\nuntil matters should clear up, and Gérard's arrival should give him\r\nstrength to compass Blücher's utter overthrow while in the act of\r\nstretching a feeler towards Wellington. From the time when the Emperor\r\ncame on the scene to the first swell of the battle's roar, there was a\r\nspace of more than four hours.\r\n\r\nThis delay was doubly precious to the allies. It gave Blücher time to\r\nbring up the corps of Pirch I. and Thielmann under cover of the high\r\nground near Sombref, thereby raising his total force to about 87,000\r\nmen; and it enabled the two allied commanders to meet and hastily\r\nconfer on the situation. Wellington had left Brussels that morning at\r\n8 o'clock, and thanks to Ney's inaction, was able to reach the crest\r\nsouth of Quatre Bras a little after 10, long before the enemy showed\r\nany signs of life. There he penned a note to Blücher, asking for news\r\nfrom him before deciding on his operations for the day.[485] He then\r\ngalloped over to the windmill of Bussy to meet Blücher.\r\n\r\nIt was an anxious meeting; the heads of the advancing French columns\r\nwere already in sight; and the Duke saw with dismay the position of\r\nthe Prussians on a slope that must expose them to the full force of\r\nNapoleon's cannon--or, as he whispered to Hardinge, \"they will be\r\ndamnably mauled if they fight here.\"[486] In more decorous terms, but\r\nto the same effect, he warned Gneisenau, and said nothing to encourage\r\nhim to hold fast to his position. Neither did he lead him to expect\r\naid from Quatre Bras. The utmost that Gneisenau could get from him was\r\nthe promise, \"Well! I will come provided I am not attacked myself.\"\r\nDid these words induce the Prussians to accept battle at Ligny? It is\r\nimpossible to think so. Everything tends to show that Blücher had\r\ndetermined to fight there. The risk was great; for, as we learn from\r\nGeneral Reiche, the position was seen to admit of no vigorous\r\noffensive blows against the French. But fortune smiled on the veteran\r\nField-Marshal, and averted what might have been an irretrievable\r\ndisaster.[487]\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the inequalities of the ground hid the strength of\r\nPirch I. and Thielmann; for Napoleon still believed that he had ranged\r\nagainst him at Ligny only a single corps. At 2 p.m. Soult informed Ney\r\nthat the enemy had united a _corps_ between Sombref and Bry, and that\r\nin half an hour Grouchy would attack it. Ney was therefore to beat\r\nback the foes at Quatre-Bras, and then turn to envelop the Prussians.\r\n_But if these were driven in first, the Emperor would move towards Ney\r\nto hasten his operations_.[488] Not until the battle was about to\r\nbegin does the Emperor seem to have realized that he was in presence\r\nof superior forces.[489] But after 2 p.m. their masses drew down over\r\nthe slopes of Bry and Sombref, their foremost troops held the villages\r\nof Ligny and St. Amand, while their left crowned the ridge of\r\nTongrines. Napoleon reformed his lines, which had hitherto been at\r\nright angles to the main road through Fleurus. Vandamme's corps moved\r\noff towards St. Amand; and Gérard, after ranging his corps parallel to\r\nthat road, began to descend towards Ligny, Grouchy meanwhile\r\nmarshalling the cavalry to protect their flank and rear. Behind all\r\nstood the imposing mass of the Imperial Guard on the rising ground\r\nnear Fleurus.\r\n\r\nThe fiercest shock of battle fell upon the corps of Vandamme and\r\nGérard. Three times were Gérard's men driven back by the volleys of\r\nthe Prussians holding Ligny. But the French cannon open fire with\r\nterrific effect. Roofs crumble away, and buildings burst into flame.\r\nOnce more the French rush to the onset, and a furious hand-to-hand\r\nscuffle ensues. Half stifled by heat, smoke, and dust, the rival\r\nnations fight on, until the defenders give way and fall back on the\r\nfurther part of the village behind the brook; but, when reinforced,\r\nthey rally as fiercely as ever, and drive the French over its banks;\r\nlane, garden, and attic once more become the scene of struggles where\r\nno man thinks of giving or taking quarter.\r\n\r\nHigher up the stream, at St. Amand, Vandamme's troops fared no better;\r\nfor Blücher steadily fed that part of his array. In so doing, however,\r\nhe weakened his reserves behind Ligny, thereby unwittingly favouring\r\nNapoleon's design of breaking the Prussian centre, and placing its\r\nwreckage and the whole of their right wing between two fires. The\r\nEmperor expected that, by 6 o'clock, Ney would have driven back the\r\nAnglo-Dutch forces, and would be ready to envelop the Prussian right.\r\nThat was the purport of Soult's despatch of 3.15 p.m. to Ney: \"This\r\narmy [the Prussian] is lost, if you act with vigour. The fate of\r\nFrance is in your hands.\"\r\n\r\nBut at 5.30, when part of the Imperial Guard was about to strengthen\r\nGérard for the decisive blow at the Prussian centre, Vandamme sent\r\nword that a hostile force of some twenty or thirty thousand men was\r\nmarching towards Fleurus. This strange apparition not only unsteadied\r\nthe French left: it greatly perplexed the Emperor. As he had ordered\r\nfirst Ney and then D'Erlon to march, not on Fleurus, but against the\r\nrear of the Prussian right wing, he seems to have concluded that this\r\nnew force must be that of Wellington about to deal the like deadly\r\nblow against the French rear.[490] Accordingly he checked the advance\r\nof the Guard until the riddle could be solved. After the loss of\r\nnearly two hours it was solved by an aide-de-camp, who found that the\r\nforce was D'Erlon's, and that it had retired.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the battle had raged with scarcely a pause, the French guns\r\nworking frightful havoc among the dense masses on the opposite slope.\r\nAnd yet, by withdrawing troops to his right, Blücher had for a time\r\noverborne Vandamme's corps and part of the Young Guard, unconscious\r\nthat his insistence on this side jeopardized the whole Prussian army.\r\nHis great adversary had long marked the immense extension of its\r\nconcave front, the massing of its troops against St. Amand, and the\r\nremoteness of its left wing, which Grouchy's horsemen still held in\r\ncheck; and he now planned that, while Blücher assailed St. Amand and\r\nits hamlets, the Imperial Guard should crush the Prussian centre at\r\nLigny, thrust its fragments back towards St. Amand, and finally shiver\r\nthe greater part of the Prussian army on the anvil which D'Erlon's\r\ncorps would provide further to the west. He now felt assured of\r\nvictory; for the corps of Lobau was nearing Fleurus to take the place\r\nof the Imperial Guard; and the Prussians had no supports. \"They have\r\nno reserve,\" he remarked, as he swept the hostile position with his\r\nglass. This was true: their centre consisted of troops that for four\r\nhours had been either torn by artillery or exhausted by the fiendish\r\nstrife in Ligny.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as if the pent-up powers of Nature sought to cow rebellious\r\nman into awe and penitence, the artillery of the sky pealed forth.\r\nCrash after crash shook the ground; flash upon flash rent the\r\nsulphur-laden rack; darkness as of night stole over the scene; and a\r\ndeluge of rain washed the blood-stained earth. The storm served but to\r\naid the assailants in their last and fiercest efforts. Amidst the\r\ngloom the columns of the Imperial Guard crept swiftly down the slope\r\ntowards Ligny, gave new strength to Gérard's men, and together with\r\nthem broke through the defence. A little higher up the stream,\r\nMilhaud's cuirassiers struggled across, and, animated by the Emperor's\r\npresence, poured upon the shattered Prussian centre. No timely help\r\ncould it now receive either from Blücher or Thielmann; for the\r\ndarkness of the storm had shrouded from view the beginnings of the\r\nonset, and Thielmann had just suffered from a heedless assault on\r\nGrouchy's wing.\r\n\r\nAs the thunder-clouds rolled by, the gleams of the setting sun lit up\r\nthe field and revealed to Blücher the full extent of his error.[491]\r\nHis army was cut in twain. In vain did he call in his troops from St.\r\nAmand: in vain did he gallop back to his squadrons between Bry and\r\nSombref and lead them forward. Their dashing charge was suddenly\r\nchecked at the brink of a hollow way; steady volleys tore away their\r\nfront; and the cuirassiers completed their discomfiture. Blücher's\r\ncharger was struck by a bullet, and in his fall badly bruised the\r\nField-Marshal; but his trusty adjutant, Nostitz, managed to hide him\r\nin the twilight, while the cuirassiers swept onwards up the hill.\r\nOther Prussian squadrons, struggling to save the day, now charged home\r\nand drove back the steel-clad ranks. Some Uhlans and mounted Landwehr\r\nreached the place where the hero lay; and Nostitz was able to save\r\nthat precious life. Sorely battered, but still defiant like their\r\nchief, the Prussian cavalry covered the retreat at the centre; the\r\nwings fell back in good order, the right holding on to the village of\r\nBry till past midnight; but several battalions of disaffected troops\r\nbroke up and did not rejoin their comrades. About 14,000 Prussians and\r\n11,000 French lay dead or wounded on that fatal field.[492]\r\n\r\nNapoleon, as he rode back to Fleurus after nightfall, could claim that\r\nhe had won a great victory. Yet he had not achieved the results\r\nportrayed in Soult's despatch of 3.15 to Ney. This was due partly to\r\nNey's failure to fulfil his part of the programme, and partly to the\r\napparition of D'Erlon's corps, which led to the postponement of\r\nNapoleon's grand attack on Ligny.\r\n\r\nThe mystery as to the movements of D'Erlon and his 20,000 men has\r\nnever been fully cleared up. The evidence collected by Houssaye leaves\r\nlittle doubt that, as soon as the Emperor realized the serious nature\r\nof the conflict at Ligny, he sent orders to D'Erlon, whose vanguard\r\nwas then near Frasnes, to diverge and attack Blücher's exposed flank.\r\nThat is to say, D'Erlon was now called on to deal the decisive blow\r\nwhich had before been assigned to Ney, who was now warned, though very\r\ntardily, not to rely on the help of D'Erlon's corps. Misunderstanding\r\nhis order, D'Erlon made for Fleurus, and thus alarmed Napoleon and\r\ndelayed his final blow for wellnigh two hours. Moreover, at 6 p.m.,\r\nwhen D'Erlon might have assailed Blücher's right with crushing effect,\r\nhe received an urgent command from Ney to return. Assuredly he should\r\nnot have hesitated now that St. Amand was almost within cannon-shot,\r\nwhile Quatre Bras could scarcely be reached before nightfall; but he\r\nwas under Ney's command; and, taking a rather pedantic view of the\r\nsituation, he obeyed his immediate superior. Lastly, no one has\r\nexplained why the Emperor, as soon as he knew the errant corps to be\r\nthat of D'Erlon, did not recall him at once, bidding him fall on the\r\nexposed wing of the Prussians. Doubtless he assumed that D'Erlon would\r\nnow fulfil his instructions and march against Bry; but he gave no\r\norder to this effect, and the unlucky corps vanished.\r\n\r\nAt that time a desperate conflict was drawing to a close at Quatre\r\nBras. Ney had delayed his attack until 2 p.m.; for, firstly, Reille's\r\ncorps alone was at hand--D'Erlon's rearguard early on that morning\r\nbeing still near Thuin--and, secondly, the Marshal heard at 10 a.m.\r\nthat Prussian columns were marching westwards from Sombref, a move\r\nthat would endanger his rear behind Frasnes. Furthermore, the approach\r\nto Quatre Bras was flanked by the extensive Bossu Wood, and by a\r\nspinney to the right of the highway. Reille therefore counselled\r\ncaution, lest the affair should prove to be \"a Spanish battle where\r\nthe English show themselves only when it is time.\" When, however,\r\nReille's corps pushed home the attack, the weakness of the defence was\r\nspeedily revealed. After a stout stand, the 7,000 Dutch-Belgians under\r\nthe Prince of Orange were driven from the farm of Gémioncourt, which\r\nformed the key of the position, and many of them fled from the field.\r\n\r\nBut at this crisis the Iron Duke himself rode up; and the arrival of a\r\nDutch-Belgian brigade and of Picton's division of British infantry,\r\nabout 3 p.m., sufficed to snatch victory from the Marshal's\r\ngrasp.[493] He now opened a destructive artillery fire on our front,\r\nto which the weak Dutch-Belgian batteries could but feebly reply.\r\nNothing, however, could daunt the hardihood of Picton's men. Shaking\r\noff the fatigue of a twelve hours' march from Brussels under a burning\r\nsun, they steadily moved down through the tall crops of rye towards\r\nthe farm and beat off a fierce attack of Piré's horsemen. On the\r\nallied left, the 95th Rifles (now the Rifle Brigade) and Brunswickers\r\nkept a clutch on the Namur road which nothing could loosen. But our\r\ndanger was mainly at the centre. Under cover of the farmhouse, French\r\ncolumns began to drive in our infantry, whose ammunition was already\r\nrunning low. Wellington determined to crush this onset by a\r\ncounter-attack in line of Picton's division, the \"fighting division\"\r\nof the Peninsula. With threatening shouts they advanced to the charge;\r\nand before that moving wall the foe fell back in confusion beyond the\r\nrivulet.\r\n\r\nStill, the French drove back the Dutch in the wood, and the\r\nBrunswickers on its eastern fringe, killing the brave young Duke of\r\nBrunswick as he attempted to rally his raw recruits. Into the gap thus\r\nleft the French horsemen pushed forward, making little impression upon\r\nour footmen, but compelling them to keep in a close formation, which\r\nexposed them in the intervals between the charges to heavy losses from\r\nthe French cannon.\r\n\r\nSo the afternoon wore on. Between 5 and 6 o'clock our weary troops\r\nwere reinforced by Alten's division. A little later, a brigade of\r\nKellermann's heavy cavalry came up from the rear and renewed Ney's\r\nstriking power--but again too late. Already he was maddened by the\r\ntidings that D'Erlon's corps had been ordered off towards Ligny, and\r\nnext by Napoleon's urgent despatch of 3.15 p.m. bidding him envelop\r\nBlücher's right. Blind with indignation at this seeming injustice, he\r\nat once sent an imperative summons to D'Erlon to return towards Quatre\r\nBras, and launched a brigade of Kellermann's cuirassiers at those\r\nstubborn squares.\r\n\r\nThe attack nearly succeeded. The horsemen rushed upon our 69th\r\nRegiment just when the Prince of Orange had foolishly ordered it back\r\ninto line, caught it in confusion, and cut it up badly. Another\r\nregiment, the 33rd, fled into the wood, but afterwards re-formed; the\r\nother squares beat off the onset. The torrent, however, only swerved\r\naside: on it rushed almost to the cross-roads, there to be stopped by\r\na flanking fire from the wood and from the 92nd (Gordon) Highlanders\r\nlining the roadway in front.--\"Ninety-second, don't fire till I tell\r\nyou,\" exclaimed the Duke. The volley rang out when the horsemen were\r\nbut thirty paces off. The effect was magical. Their front was torn\r\nasunder, and the survivors made off in a panic that spread to Foy's\r\nbattalions of foot and disordered the whole array.[494]\r\n\r\nNey still persisted in his isolated assaults; but reinforcements were\r\nnow at hand that brought up Wellington's total to 31,000 men, while\r\nthe French were less than 21,000. At nightfall the Marshal drew back\r\nto Frasnes; and there D'Erlon's errant corps at last appeared. Thanks\r\nto conflicting orders, it had oscillated between two battles and taken\r\npart in neither of them.\r\n\r\nSuch was the bloody fight of Quatre Bras. It cost Wellington 4,600\r\nkilled and wounded, mainly from the flower of the British infantry,\r\nthree Highland regiments losing as many as 878 men. The French losses\r\nwere somewhat lighter. Few conflicts better deserve the name of\r\nsoldiers' battles. On neither side was the generalship brilliant.\r\nTwilight set in before an adequate force of British cavalry and\r\nartillery approached the field where their comrades on foot had for\r\nfive hours held up in unequal contest against cannon, sabre, and\r\nlance. The victory was due to the strange power of the British soldier\r\nto save the situation when it seems past hope.\r\n\r\nStill less did it redound to the glory of Ney. Once more he had\r\nmerited the name of bravest of the brave. At the crisis of the fight,\r\nwhen the red squares in front defied his utmost efforts, he brandished\r\nhis sword in helpless wrath, praying that the bullets that flew by\r\nmight strike him down. The rage of battle had, in fact, partly\r\nobscured his reason. He was now a fighter, scarcely a commander; and\r\nto this cause we may attribute his neglect adequately to support\r\nKellermann's charge. Had this been done, Quatre Bras might have ended\r\nlike Marengo. Far more serious, however, was his action in\r\ncountermanding the Emperor's orders' by recalling D'Erlon to Quatre\r\nBras; for, as we have seen, it robbed his master of the decisive\r\nvictory that he had the right to expect at Ligny. Yet this error must\r\nnot be unduly magnified. It is true that Napoleon at 3.15 sent a\r\ndespatch to Ney bidding him envelop Blücher's flank; but the order did\r\nnot reach him until some time after 5, when the allies were pressing\r\nhim hard, and when he had just heard of D'Erlon's deflection towards\r\nthe Emperor's battle.[495] He must have seen that his master misjudged\r\nthe situation at Quatre Bras; and in such circumstances a Marshal of\r\nFrance was not without excuse when he corrected an order which he saw\r\nto be based on a misunderstanding. Some part of the blame must surely\r\nattach to the slow-paced D'Erlon and to the Emperor himself, who first\r\nunderrated the difficulties both at Ligny and Quatre Bras, and then\r\nchanged his plans when Ney was in the midst of a furious fight.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the general results obtained on June the 16th were\r\nenormously in favour of Napoleon. He had inflicted losses on the\r\nPrussians comparable with those of Jena-Auerstädt; and he retired to\r\nrest at Fleurus with the conviction that they must hastily fall back\r\non their immediate bases of supply, Namur and Liège, leaving\r\nWellington at his mercy. The rules of war and the dictates of humdrum\r\nprudence certainly prescribed this course for a beaten army,\r\nespecially as Bülow's corps was known to be on the Liège road.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the Prussian retreat begun in the darkness, when officers\r\npressed up to Gneisenau, on whom now devolved all responsibility, for\r\ninstructions as to the line of march. At once he gave the order to\r\npush northwards to Tilly. General Reiche thereupon pointed out that\r\nthis village was not marked upon the smaller maps with which colonels\r\nwere provided; whereupon the command was given to march towards the\r\ntown of Wavre, farther distant on the same road. An officer was posted\r\nat the junction of roads to prevent regiments straying towards Namur;\r\nbut some had already gone too far on this side to be recalled--a fact\r\nwhich was to confuse the French pursuers on the morrow. The greater\r\npart of Thielmann's corps had fallen back on Gembloux; but, with these\r\nexceptions, the mass of the Prussians made for Tilly, near which place\r\nthey bivouacked. Early on the next morning their rearguard drew off\r\nfrom Sombref; and, thanks to the inertness of their foes, the line of\r\nretreat remained unknown. During the march to Wavre, their columns\r\nwere cheered by the sight of the dauntless old Field-Marshal, who was\r\nable to sit a horse once more. Thielmann's corps did not leave\r\nGembloux till 2 p.m., but reached Wavre in safety. Meanwhile Bülow's\r\npowerful corps was marching unmolested from the Roman road near Hannut\r\nto a position two miles east of Wavre, where it arrived at nightfall.\r\nEqually fortunate was the reserve ammunition train, which, unnoticed\r\nby the French cavalry, wound northwards by cross-roads through\r\nGembloux, and reached the army by 5 p.m.[496]\r\n\r\nIn his \"Commentaries,\" written at St. Helena, Napoleon sharply\r\ncriticised the action of Gneisenau in retreating northwards to Wavre,\r\nbecause that town is farther distant from Wellington's line of retreat\r\nthan Sombref is from Quatre Bras, and is connected with it only by\r\ndifficult cross-roads. He even asserted that the Prussians ought to\r\nhave made for Quatre Bras, a statement which presumes that Gneisenau\r\ncould have rallied his army sufficiently after Ligny to file away on\r\nthe Quatre Bras _chaussée_ in front of Napoleon's victorious legions.\r\nBut the Prussian army was virtually cut in half, and could not have\r\nreunited so as to attempt the perilous flank march across Napoleon's\r\nfront. We shall, therefore, probably not be far wrong if we say of\r\nthis criticism that the wish was father to the thought. A march on\r\nQuatre Bras would have been a safe means of throwing away the Prussian\r\narmy.[497]\r\n\r\nTo the present writer it seems probable that Gneisenau's action, in\r\nthe first instance, was undertaken as the readiest means of reuniting\r\nthe Prussian wings. But Gneisenau cannot have been blind to the\r\nadvantages of a reunion with Wellington, which a northerly march would\r\nopen out. The report which he sent to his Sovereign from Wavre shows\r\nthat by that time he believed the Prussian position to be \"not\r\ndisadvantageous\"; while in a private letter written at noon on the\r\n17th he expressly states that the Duke will accept battle at Waterloo\r\nif the Prussians help him with two army corps. Gneisenau's only doubts\r\nseem to have been whether Wellington would fight and whether his own\r\nammunition would be to hand in time. Until he was sure on these two\r\npoints caution was certainly necessary.\r\n\r\nThe results of this prompt rally of the Prussians were infinitely\r\nenhanced by the fact that Wellington soon found it out, while Napoleon\r\ndid not grasp its full import until he was in the thick of the battle\r\nof Waterloo. To the final steps that led up to this dramatic finale we\r\nmust now briefly refer.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that Gneisenau, on the night of the 16th, took no steps\r\nto warn his allies of the Prussian retreat, and merely left them to\r\ninfer it from his last message, that he must do so if he were not\r\nsuccoured. Müffling, indeed, says that a Prussian officer was sent,\r\nbut was shot by the French on the British left wing. Seeing, however,\r\nthat Wellington had beaten back Ney's forces before the Prussian\r\nretreat began, the story may be dismissed as a lame excuse of\r\nGneisenau's neglect.[498]\r\n\r\nFrom the risk of being crushed by Napoleon, the Anglo-Dutch forces\r\nwere saved by the vigilance of their leader and the supineness of the\r\nenemy. After a brief rest at Genappe, the Duke was back at the front\r\nat dawn, and despatched two cavalry patrols towards Sombref to find\r\nout the results of the battle. The patrol, which was accompanied by\r\nthe Duke's aide-de-camp, Colonel Gordon, came into touch with the\r\nPrussian rear. On his return soon after 10, the staff-officer, Basil\r\nJackson, was at once sent to bid Picton immediately prepare to fall\r\nback on Waterloo, an order which that veteran received very\r\nsulkily.[499] Shortly after Gordon's return, a Prussian orderly\r\ngalloped up and confirmed the news of their retreat, which drew from\r\nthe Duke the remark: \"Blücher has had a d---- d good licking and gone\r\nback to Wavre.... As he has gone back, we must go too.\" The infantry\r\nnow began to file off by degrees behind hedges or under cover of a\r\nscreen of cavalry and skirmishers, these keeping Ney's men busy in\r\nfront, until the bulk of the army was well through the narrow and\r\ncrowded street of Genappe.\r\n\r\nAnd how came it that Napoleon and Ney missed this golden opportunity?\r\nIn the first case, it was due to their chiefs of staff, who had not\r\nsent overnight any tidings as to the results of their respective\r\nbattles. Until Count Flahaut returned to the Imperial headquarters\r\nabout 8 a.m., Napoleon knew nothing as to the position of affairs at\r\nQuatre Bras; while a similar carelessness on Soult's part left Ney\r\npowerless to attempt anything against Wellington until somewhat later\r\nin the morning.\r\n\r\nBut Napoleon's inaction lasted nearly up to 11.30. How is this to be\r\naccounted for? In reply, some attribute his conduct to illness of body\r\nand torpor of mind--a topic that will engage our attention presently;\r\nothers assert that the army urgently needed rest; but the effective\r\ncause was his belief that the Prussians were retreating eastwards away\r\nfrom Wellington. This was the universal belief at headquarters. He had\r\nordered Grouchy to follow them at dawn; Grouchy's lieutenant, Pajol,\r\nstruck to the south-east, and by 4 a.m. reported that Blücher was\r\nheading for Namur. Such was the news that the Emperor heard from\r\nGrouchy about 8 a.m.--he refused to grant him an audience earlier.\r\nForthwith he dictated a letter to Ney to the following effect: that\r\nthe Prussians had been routed and were being pursued towards Namur;\r\nthat the British could not attack him (Ney) at Quatre Bras, for the\r\nEmperor would in that case march on their flank and destroy them in an\r\ninstant; that he heard with pain how isolated Ney's troops had been on\r\nthe 16th, and ordered him to close up his divisions and occupy Quatre\r\nBras. If he could not effect that task, he must warn the Emperor, who\r\nwould then come. Finally, he warned him that \"the present day is\r\nneeded to finish this operation, to complete the munitions of war, to\r\nrally stragglers and call in detachments.\"\r\n\r\nA singular day's programme this for the man who had trebled the\r\nresults of the victory of Jena by the remorseless energy of the\r\npursuit. After dictating this despatch, he ordered Lobau to take a\r\ndivision of infantry for the support of Pajol on the Namur road. He\r\nthen set out for St. Amand in his carriage. On arriving at the place\r\nof carnage he mounted his horse and rode slowly over the battle-field,\r\nseeing to the needs of the wounded of both nations with kindly care,\r\nand everywhere receiving the enthusiastic acclaim of his soldiery.\r\nThis done, he dismounted and talked long and earnestly with Grouchy,\r\nGérard, and others on the state of political parties at Paris. They\r\nlistened with ill-concealed restlessness. At Fleurus Grouchy asked for\r\ndefinite orders, and received the brusque reply that he must wait. But\r\nnow, towards 11 o'clock, the Emperor hears that Wellington is still at\r\nQuatre Bras, that Pajol has captured eight Prussian guns on the Namur\r\nroad, and that Excelmans has seen masses of the enemy at Gembloux. At\r\nonce he turns from politics to war.\r\n\r\nHis plan is formed. While he himself falls on the British, Grouchy is\r\nto pursue the Prussians with the corps of Gérard and Vandamme, the\r\ndivision of Teste (from Lobau's command), and the cavalry corps of\r\nPajol, Excelmans, and Milhaud. The Marshal begged to be relieved of\r\nthe task, setting forth the danger of pursuing foes that were now\r\nreunited and far away. It was in vain. About 11.30 the Emperor\r\ndeveloped his verbal instructions in a written order penned by\r\nBertrand. It bade Grouchy proceed to Gembloux with the forces stated\r\nabove (except Milhaud's corps and a division of Vandamme's corps,\r\nwhich were to follow Napoleon) to reconnoitre on the roads leading to\r\nNamur and Maestricht, to pursue the enemy, and inform the Emperor as\r\nto their intentions. If they have evacuated Namur, it is to be\r\noccupied by the National Guards. \"It is important to know what Blücher\r\nand Wellington mean to do, and whether they propose reuniting their\r\narmies in order to cover Brussels and Liège, by trying their fortune\r\nin another battle....\"[500]\r\n\r\nAs Napoleon's fate was to depend largely on an intelligent carrying\r\nout of this order, we may point out that it consisted of two chief\r\nparts, the general aim and the means of carrying out that aim. The aim\r\nwas to find out the direction of the Prussians' retreat, and to\r\nprevent them joining Wellington, whether for the defence of Brussels\r\nor of Liège. The means were an advance to Gembloux and scouting along\r\nthe Namur and Maestricht roads. The chance that the allies might\r\nreunite for the defence of Brussels was alluded to, but no measures\r\nwere prescribed as to scouting in that direction: these were left to\r\nGrouchy's discretion. It must be confessed that the order was not\r\nwholly clear. To name the towns of Brussels and Liège (which are sixty\r\nmiles apart) was sufficiently distracting; and to suggest that only\r\nthe eastern and south-eastern roads should be explored was certain to\r\nlimit Grouchy's immediate attention to those roads alone. For he\r\ndistrusted alike his own abilities and the power of the force placed\r\nat his disposal; and an officer thus situated is sure to inclose\r\nhimself in the strict letter of his instructions. This was what he\r\ndid, with disastrous results.\r\n\r\nGrouchy had hitherto held no important command. As a cavalry general\r\nhe had done brilliant service; but now he was launched on a duty that\r\ncalled for strategic insight. His force was scarcely equal to the\r\nwork. True, it was strong for scouting, having nearly 6,000 light\r\nhorse; but the 27,000 footmen of Vandamme's and Gérard's corps had\r\nbeen exhausted by the deadly strife in the villages and were expecting\r\na day's rest. Their commanders also resented being placed under\r\nGrouchy. In fact, leaders and men disliked the task, and set about it\r\nin a questioning, grumbling way. The infantry did not start till about\r\n3 o'clock and only reached Gembloux late that evening--nine miles in\r\nsix hours! The cavalry, too, was so badly handled by Excelmans around\r\nGembloux that Thielmann's corps slipped away northward. The rain fell\r\nin torrents, obscuring the view; but it seems strange that the\r\ndirection of the Prussian retreat was not surmised until about\r\nnightfall.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the French left wing, Ney had been equally lax. He must\r\nhave received Napoleon's order to occupy Quatre Bras, \"if there was\r\nonly a rearguard there,\" a little before 10 a.m.; but he took no steps\r\nbeyond futile skirmishing, and apparently knew not that the British\r\nwere slipping away.\r\n\r\nAbout 2 p.m., when the British cavalry was ready to turn rein, the\r\nDuke and Sir H. Vivian saw the glint of cuirasses along the Sombref\r\nroad. It was the vanguard of the Emperor's advance. Furious that his\r\nfoes were escaping from his clutches, Napoleon had left his carriage\r\nand was pressing on with the foremost horsemen. To Ney he sent an\r\nimperative summons to advance, and when that Marshal came up, greeted\r\nhim with the words \"You have ruined France.\" But it was time for\r\ndeeds, not words; and he now put forth all his strength. At once he\r\nflung his powerful cavalry at the British rear; and even now it might\r\nhave gone hard with Wellington had not the lowering clouds burst in a\r\ndeluge of rain. Quickly the road was ploughed up; and the cornfields\r\nbecame impassable for the French horsemen.\r\n\r\nWhile the pursuers struggled in the mire and aimed wildly through the\r\npelting haze, the British rearguard raced for safety. Says Captain\r\nMercer of the artillery: \"We galloped for our lives through the storm,\r\nstriving to gain the hamlets, Lord Uxbridge urging us on, crying 'Make\r\nhaste; for God's sake gallop, or you will be taken.'\"[501] Gaining on\r\nthe pursuit, they reached Genappe, and, filing over its bridge and up\r\nthe narrow street, prepared to check the French. At this time the\r\nEmperor galloped up, drenched to the skin, his gray overcoat streaming\r\nwith rain, his hat bent out of all shape by the storm.[502] He was\r\nonce more the artillery officer of Toulon. \"Fire on them,\" he shouted\r\nto his gunners, \"they are English.\" A sharp skirmish ensued, in which\r\nour 7th Hussars, charging down into the village, were worsted by the\r\nFrench lancers, \"an arm,\" says Cotton, \"with which we were quite\r\nunacquainted.\" In their retreat they were saved by the Life Guards,\r\nwhose weight and strength carried all before them.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the ridge of Waterloo, Wellington's force turned at bay.\r\nNapoleon, coming up at 6.30 to the brow of the opposite slope, ordered\r\na strong force to advance into the sodden clay of the valley. It was\r\npromptly torn by a heavy cannonade; and the truth was borne in on him\r\nthat the British had escaped him for that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON'S HEALTH IN THE WATERLOO CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\n\r\nAs many writers assert that Napoleon at this time was but the shadow\r\nof his former self, we must briefly review the evidence of\r\ncontemporaries on this subject; for if the assertion be true, the\r\nBattle of Waterloo deserves little notice.\r\n\r\nIt seems that for some time past there had been a slight falling off\r\nin his mental and bodily powers; but when it began and how far it\r\nprogressed is matter of doubt. Some observers, including Chaptal, date\r\nit from the hardships of the retreat from Moscow. This is very\r\ndoubtful. He ended that campaign in a better state of health than he\r\nhad enjoyed during the advance. Besides, in none of his wars did he\r\nshow such vitality and fertility of resource as in the desperate\r\nstruggle of 1814, which Wellington pronounced his masterpiece. After\r\nthis there seems to have been a period of something like relapse at\r\nElba. In September, 1814, Sir Neil Campbell reported: \"Napoleon seems\r\nto have lost all habits of study and sedentary application. He\r\noccasionally falls into a state of inactivity never known before, and\r\nsometimes reposes in his bedroom of late for several hours in the day;\r\ntakes exercise in a carriage and not on horseback. His health\r\nexcellent and his spirits not at all depressed\" (\"F.O.,\" France, No.\r\n114). During his ten months at Elba he became very stout and his\r\ncheeks puffy.\r\n\r\nOn his return to France he displayed his old activity; and the most\r\ncredible witnesses assert that his faculties showed no marked decline.\r\nGuizot, who saw a good deal of him, writes: \"I perceive in the\r\nintellect and conduct of Napoleon during the Hundred Days no sign of\r\nenfeebling: I find in his judgment and actions his accustomed\r\nqualities.\" In a passage quoted above (p. 449) Mollien notes that his\r\nmaster was a prey to lassitude after some hours of work, but he says\r\nnothing on the subject of disease; and in a man of forty-six, who had\r\nlived a hard life and a \"fast\" life, we should not expect to find the\r\ncapacity for the sustained intellectual efforts of the Consulate.\r\nMéneval noticed nothing worse in his master's condition than a\r\ntendency to \"réverie\": he detected no disease. The statement of\r\nPasquier that his genius and his physical powers were in a profound\r\ndecline is a manifest exaggeration, uttered by a man who did not once\r\nsee him before Waterloo, who was driven from Paris by him, and strove\r\nto discourage his supporters. Still less can we accept the following\r\nmelodramatic description, by Thiébault, of Napoleon's appearance on\r\nSunday, June 11th: \"His look, once so formidable and piercing, had\r\nlost its strength and even its steadiness: his face had lost all\r\nexpression and all its force: his mouth, compressed, had none of its\r\nformer witchery: and his gait was as perplexed as his demeanour and\r\ngestures were undecided: the ordinary pallor of his skin was replaced\r\nby a strongly pronounced greenish tinge which struck me.\"\r\n\r\nLet us follow this wreck of a man to the war and see what he\r\naccomplished. At dawn on June 12th he entered his landau and drove to\r\nLaon, a distance of some seventy miles. On the next day he got through\r\nan immense amount of work, and proceeded to Beaumont. On the 15th of\r\nJune he was up at dawn, mounted his horse, and remained on horseback,\r\ndirecting the operations against the Prussians, for nearly eighteen\r\nhours. This time was broken by one spell of rest. Near Charleroi, says\r\nBaudus, an officer of Soult's staff, he was overcome by sleep and\r\nheeded not the cheers of a passing column: at this Baudus was\r\nindignant, but most unjustly so. Napoleon needed these snatches of\r\nsleep as a relief to prolonged mental tension. At night he returned to\r\nCharleroi, \"overcome with fatigue.\" On the next day he was still very\r\nweary, says Ségur; he did not exert himself until the battle of Ligny\r\nbegan at 2.30; but he then rode about till nightfall, through a time\r\nof terrible heat. Fatigue showed itself again early on the morrow,\r\nwhen he declined to see Grouchy before 8 a.m. Yet his review of the\r\ntroops and his long discussions on Parisian politics were clearly due,\r\nnot to torpor, but to the belief that he had sundered the allies, and\r\ncould occupy Brussels at will; for when he found out his mistake, he\r\nshowed all the old energy, riding with the vanguard from Quatre Bras\r\nto La Belle Alliance through the violent rain.\r\n\r\nWhatever, then, were his ailments, they were not incompatible with\r\ngreat and sustained activity. What were those ailments? He is said to\r\nhave suffered from intermittent affections of the lower bowel, of the\r\nbladder, and of the skin, the two last resulting in ischury (Dorsey\r\nGardner's \"Quatre Bras, Ligny, and Waterloo,\" pp. 31-37; O'Connor\r\nMorris, pp. 164-166, note). The list is formidable; but it contains\r\nits own refutation. A man suffering from these diseases, unless in\r\ntheir earliest and mildest stages, could not have done what Napoleon\r\ndid. Ischury, if at all pronounced, is a bar to horse exercise.\r\nDoubtless his long rides aggravated any trouble that he had in this\r\nrespect, for Pétiet, who was attached to the staff, noticed that he\r\noften dismounted and sat before a little table that was brought to him\r\nfor the convenience of examining maps; but Pétiet thought this was\r\ndue, not to ill health (about which he says nothing), but to his\r\ncorpulence (\"Souvenirs militaires,\" pp. 196 and 212). Prince Jerome\r\nand a surgeon of the imperial staff assured Thiers that Napoleon was\r\nsuffering from a disease of the bladder; but this was contradicted by\r\nthe valet, Marchand; and if he really was suffering from all, or any\r\none, of the maladies named above, it is very strange that the surgeon\r\nallowed him to expose himself to the torrential rain of the night of\r\nthe 17th-18th for a purpose which a few trusty officers could equally\r\nwell have discharged (see next chapter). Furthermore, Baron Larrey,\r\nChief Surgeon of the army, who saw Napoleon before the campaign began\r\nand during its course, _says not a word about the Emperor's health_\r\n(\"Relation médicale des Campagnes, 1815-1840,\" pp. 5-11).\r\n\r\nAgain, the intervals of drowsiness on the 15th and 18th of June, on\r\nwhich the theory of physical collapse is largely based, may be\r\nexplained far more simply. Napoleon had long formed the habit of\r\nworking a good deal at night and of seeking repose during a busy day\r\nby brief snatches of slumber. The habit grew on him at Elba; and this,\r\ntogether with his activity since daybreak, accounts for his sleeping\r\nnear Charleroi. The same explanation probably holds good as to his\r\noccasional drowsiness at Waterloo. He scarcely closed his eyes before\r\n3.30 a.m.; and he cannot have been physically fit for the unexpectedly\r\nlong and severe strain of that Sunday. That he began the day well we\r\nknow from a French soldier named Barral (grandfather of the author of\r\n\"L'Epopée de Waterloo\"), who looked at him carefully at 9.30 a.m., and\r\nwrote: \"He seemed to me in very good health, extraordinarily active\r\nand preoccupied.\" Decoster, the peasant guide who was with Napoleon\r\nthe whole day, afterwards told Sir W. Scott that he was calm and\r\nconfident up to the crisis. Gourgaud, who clung to him during the\r\nflight to Paris and thence to Rochefort, notes nothing more serious\r\nthan great fatigue; Captain Maitland, when he received him on board\r\nthe \"Bellerophon,\" thought him \"a remarkably strong, well-built man.\"\r\nDuring the voyage to St. Helena he suffered from nothing worse than\r\n_mal de mer_; he ate meat in exceptional quantity, even in the\r\ntropics.\r\n\r\nVery noteworthy, too, is Lavalette's narrative. When he saw Napoleon\r\nbefore his departure from Paris to the Belgian frontier, he found him\r\nsuffering from depression and a pain in the chest; but he avers that,\r\non the return from Waterloo, apart from one \"frightful epileptic\r\nlaugh,\" Napoleon speedily settled down to his ordinary behaviour: not\r\na word is added as to his health. (Sir W. Scott, \"Life of Napoleon,\"\r\nvol. viii., p. 496; Gourgaud, \"Campagne de 1815,\" and \"Journal de St.\r\nHélène,\" vol. ii., Appendix 32; \"Narrative of Captain Maitland,\" p.\r\n208; Lavalette, \"Mems.,\" ch. xxxiii.; Houssaye ridicules the stories\r\nof his ill-health.)\r\n\r\nWhat is the upshot of it all? The evidence seems to show that,\r\nwhatever was Napoleon's condition before the campaign, he was in his\r\nusual health amidst the stern joys of war. And this is consonant with\r\nhis previous experience: he throve on events which wore ordinary\r\nbeings to the bone: the one thing that he could not endure was the\r\nworry of parliamentary opposition, which aroused a nervous irritation\r\nnot to be controlled and concealed without infinite effort. During the\r\ncampaign we find very few trustworthy proofs of his decline and much\r\nthat points to energy of resolve and great rallying power after\r\nexertion. If he was suffering from three illnesses, they were\r\nassuredly of a highly intermittent nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nWATERLOO\r\n\r\n\r\nWould Wellington hold on to his position? This was the thought that\r\ntroubled the Emperor on the night after the wild chase from Quatre\r\nBras. Before retiring to rest at the Caillou farm, he went to the\r\nfront with Bertrand and a young officer, Gudin by name, and peered at\r\nthe enemy's fires dimly seen through the driving sheets of rain.\r\nSatisfied that the allies were there, he returned to the farm,\r\ndictated a few letters on odious parliamentary topics, and then sought\r\na brief repose. But the same question drove sleep from his eyes. At\r\none o'clock he was up again and with the faithful Bertrand plashed to\r\nthe front through long rows of drenched recumbent forms. Once more\r\nthey strained their ears to catch through the hiss of the rain some\r\nsound of a muffled retirement. Strange thuds came now and again from\r\nthe depths of the wood of Hougoumont: all else was still. At last,\r\nover the slope on the north-east crowned by the St. Lambert Wood there\r\nstole the first glimmer of gray; little by little the murky void\r\nbodied forth dim shapes, and the watch-fires burnt pale against the\r\norient gleams. It was enough. He turned back to the farm. Wellington\r\ncould scarcely escape him now.\r\n\r\nWhile the Emperor was making the round of his outposts, a somewhat\r\ncryptic despatch from Grouchy reached headquarters. The Marshal\r\nreported from Gembloux, at 10 p.m. of the 17th, that part of the\r\nPrussians had retired towards Wavre, seemingly with a view to joining\r\nWellington; that their centre, led by Blücher, had fallen back on\r\nPerwez in the direction of Liège; while a column with artillery had\r\nmade for Namur; if he found the enemy's chief force to be on the Liège\r\n_chaussée_, he would pursue them along that road; if towards Wavre, he\r\nwould follow them thither \"in order that they may not gain Brussels,\r\nand so as to separate them from Wellington.\" This last phrase ought\r\nsurely to have convinced Napoleon that Grouchy had not fully\r\nunderstood his instructions; for to march on Wavre would not stop the\r\nPrussians joining Wellington, if they were in force.[503]\r\n\r\nMoreover, Napoleon now knew, what Grouchy did not know, that the\r\nPrussians were in force at Wavre. It seems strange that the Emperor\r\ndid not send this important news to his Marshal; but perhaps we may\r\nexplain this by his absence at the outposts. As it was, no clear\r\nstatement of the facts of the case was sent off to Grouchy _until 10\r\na.m. of the 18th_. He then informed his Marshal that, according to all\r\nthe reports, three bodies of Prussians had made for Wavre. Grouchy\r\n\"must therefore move thither--in order to approach us, to put yourself\r\nwithin the sphere of our operations, and to keep up your\r\ncommunications with us, pushing before you those bodies of Prussians\r\nwhich have taken this direction and which may have stopped at Wavre,\r\nwhere you ought to arrive as soon as possible.\" Grouchy, however, was\r\nnot to neglect Blücher's troops that were on his right, but must pick\r\nup their stragglers and keep up his communications with Napoleon.\r\n\r\nSuch was the letter; and again we must pronounce it far from clear.\r\nGrouchy was not bidden to throw all his efforts on the side of Wavre;\r\nand he was not told whether he must attack the enemy at that town, or\r\ninterpose a wedge between them and Wellington, or support Napoleon's\r\nright. Now Napoleon would certainly have prescribed an immediate\r\nconcentration of Grouchy's force towards the north-west for one of the\r\nlast two objects, had he believed Blücher about to attempt a flank\r\nmarch against the chief French army. Obviously it had not yet entered\r\nhis thoughts that so daring a step would be taken by a foe whom he\r\npictured as scattered and demoralized by defeat.[504]\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the Prussians were not demoralized; they had not gone\r\noff in three directions; and Blücher was not making for Liège. He was\r\nat Wavre and was planning a master-stroke. At midnight, he had sent to\r\nWellington, through Müffling, a written promise that at dawn he would\r\nset the corps of Bülow in motion against Napoleon's right; that of\r\nPirch I. was to follow; while the other two corps would also be ready\r\nto set out. Wellington received this despatch about 3 a.m. of the\r\n18th, and thereupon definitely resolved to offer battle. A similar\r\nmessage was sent off from Wavre at 9.30 a.m., but with a postscript,\r\nin which we may discern Gneisenau's distrust of Wellington, begging\r\nMüffling to find out accurately whether the Duke really had determined\r\nto fight at Waterloo. Meanwhile Bülow's corps had begun its march from\r\nthe south-east of Wavre, but with extreme slowness, which was due to a\r\nfire at Wavre, to the crowded state of the narrow road, and also to\r\nthe misgivings of Gneisenau. It certainly was not owing to fear of\r\nGrouchy; for at that time the Prussian leaders believed that only\r\n15,000 French were on their track. Not until midday, when the\r\ncannonade on the west grew to a roar, did Gneisenau decide to send\r\nforward Ziethen's corps towards Ohain, on Wellington's left; but\r\nthereafter the defence of the Dyle against Grouchy was left solely to\r\nThielmann's corps.[505]\r\n\r\nWhile this storm was brewing in the east, everything in front of the\r\nEmperor seemed to portend a prosperous day. High as he rated\r\nWellington's numbers, he had no doubt as to the result. \"The enemy's\r\narmy,\" he remarked just after breakfast, \"outnumbers ours by more than\r\na fourth; nevertheless we have ninety chances out of a hundred in our\r\nfavour.\" Ney, who then chanced to come in, quickly remarked: \"No\r\ndoubt, sire, if Wellington were simple enough to wait for you; but I\r\ncome to inform you that he is retreating.\" \"You have seen wrong,\" was\r\nthe retort, \"the time is gone for that.\" Soult did not share his\r\nmaster's assurance of victory, and once more begged him to recall some\r\nof Grouchy's force; to which there came the brutal reply: \"Because you\r\nhave been beaten by Wellington you think him a great general. And I\r\ntell you that Wellington is a bad general, that the English are bad\r\ntroops, and that this will be the affair of a _déjeuner_.\" \"I hope it\r\nmay,\" said Soult. Reille afterwards came in, and, finding how\r\nconfident the Emperor was, mentioned the matter to D'Erlon, who\r\nadvised his colleague to return and caution him. \"What is the use,\"\r\nrejoined Reille; \"he would not listen to us.\"\r\n\r\nIn truth, Napoleon was in no mood to receive advice. He admitted on\r\nthe voyage to St. Helena that \"he had not exactly reconnoitred\r\nWellington's position.\"[506] And, indeed, there seemed to be nothing\r\nmuch to reconnoitre. The Mont St. Jean, or Waterloo, position does not\r\nimpress the beholder with any sense of strength. The so-called valley,\r\nseparating the two arrays, is a very shallow depression, nowhere more\r\nthan fifty feet below the top of the northern slope. It is divided\r\nabout halfway across by an undulation that affords good cover to\r\nassailants about to attack La Haye Sainte. Another slight rise crosses\r\nthe vale halfway between this farm and Hougoumont, and facilitates the\r\napproach to that part of the ridge. In fact, only on their extreme\r\nleft could the defenders feel much security; for there the slope is\r\nsteeper, besides being protected in front by marshy ground, copses,\r\nand the hamlets of Papelotte, La Haye, and Smohain.\r\n\r\nNapoleon paid little attention to the left wing of the allies. The\r\ncentre and right centre were evidently Wellington's weak points, and\r\nthere, especially near the transverse rise, our leader chiefly massed\r\nhis troops. Yet there, too, the defence had some advantages. The front\r\nof the centre was protected by La Haye Sainte, \"a strong stone and\r\nbrick building,\" says Cotton, \"with a narrow orchard in front and a\r\nsmall garden in the rear, both of which were hedged around, except on\r\nthe east side of the garden, where there was a strong wall running\r\nalong the high-road.\" It is generally admitted that Wellington gave\r\ntoo little attention to this farm, which Napoleon saw to be the key of\r\nthe allied position. Loopholes were made in its south and east walls,\r\nbut none in the western wall, and half of the barn-door opening on the\r\nfields had been torn off for firewood by soldiers overnight. The place\r\nwas held at first by 376 men of the King's German Legion, who threw up\r\na barricade at the barn-door, as also on the high-road outside the\r\norchard; but, as the sappers and carpenters were removed to\r\nHougoumont, little could be done.\r\n\r\nFar stronger was the château of Hougoumont, which had been built with\r\na view to defence. The outbuildings were now loopholed, and scaffolds\r\nwere erected to enable our men to fire over the garden walls which\r\ncommanded the orchard. The defence was intrusted to the light\r\ncompanies of the second battalions of Coldstreams and Foot Guards (now\r\nthe Grenadier Guards); while the wood in front was held by Nassauers\r\nand Hanoverians. Chassé's Dutch-Belgians were posted at the village of\r\nBraine la Leud to give further security to Wellington's right.[507]\r\nNapoleon's intention was to pierce the allied centre behind La Haye\r\nSainte, where their lines were thin. But he did not know that behind\r\nthe crest ran a sunken cross-road, which afforded excellent cover, and\r\nthat the ground, sloping away towards Wellington's rear, screened his\r\nsecond line and reserves.\r\n\r\nIt was this peculiarity of the ground, so different from that of the\r\nexposed slope behind Ligny, that helped the great master of defensive\r\ntactics secretly to meet and promptly to foil every onset of his\r\nmighty antagonist.\r\n\r\nWhile under-estimating the strength of Wellington's position Napoleon\r\nover-rated his numbers. As we have seen, he remarked that the allies\r\nexceeded the French by more than a fourth. Now, as his own numbers\r\nwere fully 74,000, he credited the allies with upwards of 92,000. In\r\nreality, they were not more than 67,000, as Wellington had left 17,000\r\nat Hal; but if this powerful detachment had been included, Napoleon's\r\nestimate would not have been far wrong. At St. Helena he gave out that\r\nhis despatch of cavalry towards Hal had induced Wellington to weaken\r\nhis army to this extent; but Houssaye has shown that the statement is\r\nan entire fabrication. The Emperor certainly believed that all\r\nWellington's troops were close at hand.[508]\r\n\r\nThe Duke, on his side, would doubtless have retreated had he known\r\nthat the Prussian advance would be as slow as it was. His composite\r\nforces, in which five languages were spoken, were unfit for a long\r\ncontest with Napoleon's army. The Dutch-Belgian troops, numbering\r\n17,000, were known to be half-hearted; the 2,800 Nassauers, who had\r\nserved under Soult in 1813, were not above suspicion; the 11,000\r\nHanoverians and 5,900 Brunswickers were certain to do their best, but\r\nthey were mostly raw troops. In fact, Wellington could thoroughly rely\r\nonly on his 23,990 British troops and the 5,800 men of the King's\r\nGerman Legion; and among our men there was a large proportion of\r\nrecruits or drafts from militia battalions. Events were to prove that\r\nthis motley gathering could hold its own while at rest; but during the\r\nsubsequent march to Paris Wellington passed the scathing judgment\r\nthat, with the exception of his Peninsular men, it was \"the worst\r\nequipped army, with the worst staff, ever brought together.\"[509] This\r\nwas after he had lost De Lancey, Picton, Ponsonby, and many other able\r\nofficers; but on the morning of the 18th there was no lack of skill in\r\nthe placing of the troops, witness General Kennedy's arrangement of\r\nAlten's division so that it might readily fall into the \"chequer\"\r\npattern, which proved so effective against the French horsemen.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's confidence seemed to be well founded: he had 246 cannon\r\nagainst the allies' 156, and his preponderance in cavalry of the line\r\nwas equally great. Above all, there were the 13,000 footmen of the\r\nImperial Guard, flanked by 3,000 cavaliers. The effective strength of\r\nthe two armies has been reckoned by Kennedy as in the proportion of\r\nfour to seven. Why, then, did he not attack at once? There were two\r\ngood reasons: first that his men had scattered widely overnight in\r\nsearch of food and shelter, and now assembled very slowly on the\r\nplateau; second, that the rain did not abate until 8 a.m., and even\r\nthen slight drizzles came on, leaving the ground totally unfit for the\r\nmovements of horse and artillery. Leaving the troops time to form and\r\nthe ground to improve, the Emperor consulted his charts and took a\r\nbrief snatch of sleep. He then rode to the front; and, as the\r\ngray-coated figure passed along those imposing lines, the enthusiasm\r\nfound vent in one rolling roar of \"Vive l'Empereur,\" which was wafted\r\nthreateningly to the thinner array of the allies. There the leader\r\nreceived no whole-hearted acclaim save from the men who knew him; but\r\namong these there was no misgiving. \"If,\" wrote Major Simmons of the\r\n95th, \"you could have seen the proud and fierce appearance of the\r\nBritish at that tremendous moment, there was not one eye but gleamed\r\nwith joy.\"[510]\r\n\r\nThe first shots were fired at 11.50 to cover the assault on the wood\r\nof Hougoumont by Prince Jerome Bonaparte's division of Reille's corps.\r\nThe Nassauers and Hanoverians briskly replied, and Cleeve's German\r\nbattery opened fire with such effect that the leading column fell\r\nback. Again the assailants came on in greater force under shelter of a\r\ntremendous cannonade: this time they gained a lodgment, and step by\r\nstep drove the defenders back through the copse. Though checked for a\r\ntime by the Guards, they mastered the wood south of the house by about\r\none o'clock. There they should have stopped. Napoleon's orders were\r\nfor them to gain a hold only on the wood and throw out a good line of\r\nskirmishers: all that he wanted on this side was to prevent any\r\nturning movement from Wellington's advanced outposts. Reille also sent\r\norders not to attack the château; but the Prince and his men rushed on\r\nat those massive walls, only to meet with a bloody repulse. A second\r\nattack fared no better; and though some 12,000 of Reille's men\r\nFinally attacked the mansion on three sides, yet our Guards, when\r\nreinforced, beat off every onset of wellnigh ten times their numbers.\r\n\r\nFor some time the Emperor paid little heed to this waste of energy; at\r\n2 p.m. he recalled Jerome to his side. He now saw the need of\r\nhusbanding his resources; for a disaster had overtaken the French\r\nright centre. He had fixed one o'clock for a great attack on La Haye\r\nSainte by D'Erlon's corps of nearly 20,000 men. But a delay occurred\r\nowing to a cause that we must now describe.\r\n\r\nBefore his great battery of eighty guns belched forth at the centre\r\nand blotted out the view, he swept the horizon with his glass, and\r\ndiscerned on the skirts of the St. Lambert wood, six miles away, a\r\ndark object. Was it a spinney, or a body of troops? His staff officers\r\ncould not agree; but his experienced eye detected a military\r\nformation. Thereupon some of the staff asserted that they must be\r\nBlücher's men, others that they were Grouchy's. Here he could scarcely\r\nbe in a doubt. Not long after 10 a.m. he received from Grouchy a\r\ndespatch, dated from Gembloux at 3 a.m., reporting that the Prussians\r\nwere retiring in force on Brussels to concentrate or to join\r\nWellington, and that he (Grouchy) was on the point of starting for\r\nSart-à-Walhain and Wavre. He said nothing as to preventing any flank\r\nmarch that the enemy might make from Wavre with a view to joining\r\ntheir allies straightway. Therefore he was not to be looked for on\r\nthis side of Wavre, and those troops must consequently be\r\nPrussians.[511]\r\n\r\nAll doubts were removed when a Prussian hussar officer, captured by\r\nMarbot's vedettes near Lasne, was brought to Napoleon. He bore a\r\nletter from Bülow to Müffling, stating that the former was on the\r\nmarch to attack the French right wing. In reply to Napoleon's\r\nquestions the captain stated that Bülow's whole corps was in motion,\r\nbut wisely said nothing about the other two corps that were following.\r\nSuch as it was, the news in no way alarmed the Emperor. As Bülow was\r\nabout to march against the French flank, Grouchy must march on his\r\nflank and take his corps _en flagrant délit_. That is the purport of\r\nthe postscript added to a rather belated reply that was about to be\r\nsent off to Grouchy at 1 p.m. It did not reach him till 5 p.m., too\r\nlate to influence the result, even had he desisted from his attack on\r\nWavre, which he did not.[512]\r\n\r\nWe return to the Emperor's actions at half-past one. Dumont's and\r\nSubervie's light horsemen were sent out towards Frischermont to\r\nobserve the Prussians; the great battery of eighty guns, placed on the\r\nintermediate rise, now opened fire; and under cover of its deadly\r\nblasts D'Erlon's four divisions dipped down into the valley. They were\r\nranged in closely packed battalions spread out in a front of some two\r\nhundred men, a formation that Napoleon had not suggested, but did not\r\ncountermand. The left column, that of Alix, was supported by cavalry\r\non its flank. Part of this division gained the orchard of La Haye\r\nSainte, and attacked the farm buildings on all sides. From his\r\nposition hard by a great elm above the farm, Wellington had marked\r\nthis onset, and now sent down a Hanoverian battalion to succour their\r\ncompatriots; but in the cutting of the main road it was charged and\r\nrouted by Milhaud's cuirassiers, who pursued them up the slope until\r\nthe rally sounded. Farther to the east, the French seemed still surer\r\nof victory. Bylandt's Dutch-Belgians, some 3,000 strong, after\r\nsuffering heavily in their cruelly exposed position, wavered at the\r\napproach of Donzelot's column, and finally broke into utter rout,\r\npelted in their flight with undeserved gibes from the British in their\r\nrear. These consisted of Picton's division, the heroes of Quatre Bras.\r\nHere they had as yet sustained little loss, thanks to the shelter of\r\nthe hollow cross-road and a hedge.\r\n\r\nThe French columns now topped the ridge, uttering shouts of triumph,\r\nand began to deploy into line for the final charge. This was the time,\r\nas Picton well knew, to pour in a volley and dash on with the cold\r\nsteel; but as he cheered on his men, a bullet struck him in the temple\r\nand cut short his brilliant career. His tactics were successful at\r\nsome points while at others our thin lines barely held up against the\r\nmasses. Certainly no decisive result could have been gained but for\r\nthe timely onset of Ponsonby's Union Brigade--the 1st Royal Dragoons,\r\nthe Scots Greys, and the Inniskillings.\r\n\r\nAt the time when Lord Uxbridge gave the order, \"Royals and\r\nInniskillings charge, the Greys support,\" Alix's division was passing\r\nthe cross-road. But as the Royals dashed in, \"the head of the column\r\nwas seized with a panic, gave us a fire which brought down about\r\ntwenty men, then went instantly about and endeavoured to regain the\r\nopposite side of the hedges; but we were upon and amongst them, and\r\nhad nothing to do but press them down the slope.\" So wrote Captain\r\nClark Kennedy, who sabred the French colour-bearer and captured the\r\neagle. Equally brilliant was the charge of the Inniskillings, in the\r\ncentre of the brigade. They rode down Donzelot's division, jostled its\r\nranks into a helpless mass, and captured a great number of prisoners.\r\nThe Scots Greys, too, succouring the hard-pressed Gordons, fell\r\nfiercely on Marcognet's division. \"Both regiments,\" wrote Major\r\nWinchester of the 92nd, \"charged together, calling out 'Scotland for\r\never'; the Scots Greys actually walked over this column, and in less\r\nthan three minutes it was totally destroyed. The grass field, which\r\nwas only an instant before as green and smooth as Phoenix Park, was\r\ncovered with killed and wounded, knapsacks, arms, and\r\naccoutrements.\"[513]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the left of the brigade, Vandeleur's horse and some\r\nDutch-Belgian dragoons drove back Durutte's men past Papelotte. On its\r\nright, the 2nd Life Guards cut up the cuirassiers while disordered by\r\nthe sudden dip of the hollow cross-road; and further to the west, the\r\n1st Dragoon Guards and 1st Life Guards met them at the edge of the\r\nplateau, clashed furiously, burst through them, and joined in the wild\r\ncharge of Ponsonby's brigade up the opposite slope, cutting the traces\r\nof forty French cannon and sabring the gunners.\r\n\r\nBut Napoleon was awaiting the moment for revenge, and now sent forward\r\na solid force of lancers and dragoons, who fell on our disordered\r\nbands with resistless force, stabbing the men and overthrowing their\r\nwearied steeds. Here fell the gallant Ponsonby with hundreds of his\r\nmen, and, had not Vandeleur's horse checked the pursuit, very few\r\ncould have escaped. Still, this brigade had saved the day. Two of\r\nD'Erlon's columns had gained a hold on the ridge, until the sudden\r\ncharge of our horsemen turned victory into a disastrous rout that cost\r\nthe French upwards of 5,000 men.\r\n\r\nAs if exhausted by this eager strife, both armies relaxed their\r\nefforts for a space and re-formed their lines. Wellington ordered\r\nLambert's brigade of 2,200 Peninsular veterans, who had only arrived\r\nthat morning, to fill the gaps on his left. The Emperor, too, was\r\nuneasy, as he showed by taking copious pinches of snuff. He mounted\r\nhis horse and rode to the front, receiving there the cheers of his\r\nblood-stained lancers and battered infantry. Having received another\r\ndespatch from Grouchy which gave no hope of his speedy arrival, he\r\nordered his cannon once more to waste the British lines and bombard\r\nHougoumont, while Ney led two of D'Erlon's brigades that were the\r\nleast shaken to resume the attack on La Haye Sainte. Once more they\r\nwere foiled at the farm buildings by the hardy Germans, to whom\r\nWellington had sent a timely reinforcement.[514] At Hougoumont also\r\nthe Guards held firm, despite the fierce conflagration in the barn and\r\npart of the chapel. But while his best troops everywhere stood their\r\nground, the Duke saw with concern the gaps in his fighting line. Many\r\nof the Dutch-Belgians had made off to the rear; and Jackson, when\r\ncarrying an order to a reserve Dutch battery to advance--an order that\r\nwas disobeyed--saw what had become of these malingerers. \"I peeped\r\ninto the skirts of the forest and truly felt astonished: entire\r\ncompanies seemed there with regularly piled arms, fires blazing under\r\ncooking kettles, while the men lay about smoking!\"[515]\r\n\r\nFar different was the scene at the front. There the third act of the\r\ndrama was beginning. After half an hour of the heaviest cannonade ever\r\nknown, Wellington's faithful troops were threatened by an avalanche of\r\ncavalry, and promptly fell into the \"chequer\" disposition previously\r\narranged for the most exposed division, that of Alten. Napoleon\r\ncertainly hoped either to crush Wellington outright by a mighty onset\r\nof horse, or to strip him bare for the _coup de grâce_. At the Caillou\r\nfarm in the morning he said: \"I will use my powerful artillery; my\r\ncavalry shall charge; and I will advance with my Old Guard.\" The use\r\nof cavalry on a grand scale was no new thing in his wars. By it he had\r\nwon notable advantages, above all at Dresden; and he believed that\r\nfootmen, when badly shaken by artillery, could not stand before his\r\nsquadrons. The French cavalry, 15,000 strong at the outset, had as yet\r\nsuffered little, and the way had been partly cleared by the last\r\nassaults on Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte, where the defenders were\r\nwholly occupied in self-defence.\r\n\r\nBut Ney certainly pressed the first charge too soon. Doubtless he was\r\nmisled by the retirement of our first line a little way behind the\r\ncrest to gain some slight shelter from the iron storm. Looking on this\r\nprudent move as a sign of retreat he led forward the cuirassiers of\r\nMilhaud; and as these splendid brigades trotted forward, the\r\n_chasseurs à cheval_ of the Guard and \"red\" lancers joined them. More\r\nthan 5,000 strong, these horsemen rode into the valley, formed at the\r\nfoot of the slope, and then, under cover of their artillery, began to\r\nbreast the slope. At its crest the guns of the allies opened on them\r\npoint-blank; but, despite their horrible losses, they swept on,\r\ncharged through the guns and down the reverse slope towards the\r\nsquares. Volley after volley now tore through with fearful effect, and\r\nthe survivors swerved to the intervals. Their second and third lines\r\nfared little better; astonished at so stout a stand, where they looked\r\nto find only a few last despairing efforts, they fell into faltering\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n    \"As to the so-called charges,\" says Basil Jackson, \"I do not think\r\n    that on a single occasion actual collision occurred. I many times\r\n    saw the cuirassiers come on with boldness to within some twenty or\r\n    thirty yards of a square, when, seeing the steady firmness of our\r\n    men, they invariably edged away and retired. Sometimes they would\r\n    halt and gaze at the triple row of bayonets, when two or three\r\n    brave officers would advance and strive to urge the attack,\r\n    raising their helmets aloft on their sabres--but all in vain, as\r\n    no efforts could make the men close with the terrible bayonets,\r\n    and meet certain destruction.\"[516]\r\n\r\nAfter the fire of the rear squares had done its work, our cavalry fell\r\non the wavering masses; and, as they rode off, the gunners ran forth\r\nfrom the squares and plied them with shot. In a few minutes the\r\nmounted host that seemed to have swallowed up the footmen was gone,\r\nthe red and blue chequers stood forth triumphant, and the guns that\r\nshould have been spiked dealt forth death. Down below, the confused\r\nmass shaped itself for a new charge while its supports routed our\r\nhorsemen.\r\n\r\nIn this second attack Ney received a powerful reinforcement. The\r\nEmperor ordered the advance of Kellermann and of Guyot with the heavy\r\ncavalry of the Guard, thus raising the number of horsemen to about\r\n10,000. At the head of these imposing masses Ney again mounted the\r\nslope. But Wellington had strengthened his line by fresh troops,\r\nordering up also Mercer's battery of six 9-pounders, to support two\r\nBrunswick regiments that wavered ominously as the French cannon-balls\r\ntore through them. Would these bewildered lads stand before the wave\r\nof horsemen already topping the crest? It seemed impossible. But just\r\nthen Mercer's men thundered up between them with the guns, took post\r\nbehind the raised cross-road, and opened on the galloping horsemen\r\nwith case-shot. At once the front was strewn with steeds and men; and\r\ngunners and infantry riddled the successive ranks, that rushed on only\r\nto pile up writhing heaps and bar retreat to the survivors in front.\r\nSome of these sought safety by a dash through the guns, while the\r\ngreater number struggled and even laid about with their sabres to hew\r\ntheir way out of this _battue_.\r\n\r\nElsewhere the British artillery was too exposed to be defended, and\r\nthe gunners again fled back to the squares. Once more the cavalry\r\nsurrounded our footmen, like \"heavy surf breaking on a coast beset\r\nwith isolated rocks, against which the mountainous wave dashes with\r\nfurious uproar, breaks, divides, and runs hissing and boiling far\r\nbeyond.\" Yet, as before, it failed to break those stubborn blocks, and\r\na perplexing pause occurred, varied by partial and spasmodic rushes.\r\n\"Will those English never show us their backs\"--exclaimed the Emperor,\r\nas he strained his eyes to catch the first sign of rout \"I fear,\"\r\nreplied Soult, \"they will be cut to pieces first.\" For the present, it\r\nwas the cavalry that gave way. Foiled by that indomitable infantry,\r\nthey were again charged by British and German hussars and driven into\r\nthe valley.\r\n\r\nOnce more Ney led on his riders, gathering up all his reserves. But\r\nthe Duke had now brought up Adam's brigade and Duplat's King's Germans\r\nto the space behind Hougoumont; their fire took the horsemen in flank:\r\nthe blasts of grape and canister were as deadly as before: one and\r\nall, the squares held firm, beating back onset after onset: and by 6\r\no'clock the French cavalry fell away utterly exhausted.[517]\r\n\r\nWho is to be held responsible for these wasteful attacks, and why was\r\nnot French infantry at hand to hold the ground which the cavaliers\r\nseemed to have won? Undoubtedly, Ney began the first attack somewhat\r\ntoo early; but Napoleon himself strengthened the second great charge\r\nby the addition of Kellermann's and Guyot's brigades, doubtless in the\r\nbelief that the British, of whose tenacity he had never had direct\r\npersonal proof, must give way before so mighty a mass. Moreover, time\r\nafter time it seemed that the attacks were triumphant; the allied guns\r\non the right centre, except Mercer's, were nine or ten times taken,\r\ntheir front squares as often enveloped; and more than once the cry of\r\nvictory was raised by the Emperor's staff.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, was not the attack clinched by infantry? To understand this\r\nwe must review the general situation. Hougoumont still defied the\r\nattacks of nearly the whole of Reille's corps, and the effective part\r\nof D'Erlon's corps was hotly engaged at and near La Haye Sainte. Above\r\nall, the advent of the Prussians on the French right now made itself\r\nfelt. After ceaseless toil, in which the soldiers were cheered on by\r\nBlücher in person, their artillery was got across the valley of the\r\nLasne; and at 4.30 Bülow's vanguard debouched from the wood behind\r\nFrischermont. Lobau's corps of 7,800 men, which, according to Janin,\r\nwas about to support Ney, now swung round to the right to check this\r\nadvance.[518] Towards 5 o'clock the Prussian cannon opened fire on the\r\nhorsemen of Domont and Subervie, who soon fell back on Lobau.\r\n\r\nBülow pressed on with his 30,000 men, and, swinging forward his left\r\nwing, gained a footing in the village of Planchenoit, while Lobau fell\r\nback towards La Belle Alliance. This took place between 5.30 and 6\r\no'clock, and accounts for Napoleon's lack of attention to the great\r\ncavalry charges. To break the British squares was highly desirable;\r\nbut to ward off the Prussians from his rear was an imperative\r\nnecessity. He therefore ordered Duhesme with the 4,000 footmen of the\r\nYoung Guard to regain Planchenoit. Gallantly they advanced at the\r\ncharge, and drove their weary and half-famished opponents out into the\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nSatisfied with this advantage, the Emperor turned his thoughts to the\r\nBritish and bade Ney capture La Haye Sainte at all costs. Never was\r\nduty more welcome. Mistakes and failures could now be atoned by\r\ntriumph or a soldier's death. Both had as yet eluded his search. Three\r\nhorses had been struck to the ground under him, but, dauntless as\r\never, he led Donzelot's men, with engineers, against the farm.\r\nBegrimed with smoke, hoarse with shouting, he breathed the lust of\r\nbattle into those half-despondent ranks; and this time he succeeded.\r\nFor five hours the brave Germans had held out, beating off rush after\r\nrush, until now they had but three or four bullets apiece left. The\r\nordinary British ammunition did not fit their rifles; and their own\r\nreserve supply could not be found at the rear. Still, even when firing\r\nceased, bayonet-thrusts and missiles kept off the assailants for a\r\nspace, even from the half-destroyed barn-door, until Frenchmen mounted\r\nthe roof of the stables and burst through the chief gateway: then\r\nBaring and his brave fellows fled through the house to the garden. \"No\r\npardon to these green devils\" was now the cry, and those who could not\r\nmake off to the ridge were bayoneted to a man.[519]\r\n\r\nThis was a grave misfortune for the allies. French sharpshooters now\r\nlined the walls of the farm and pushed up the ridge, pressing our\r\nfront very hard, so that, for a time, the space behind La Haye Sainte\r\nwas practically bare of defenders. This was the news that Kennedy took\r\nto Wellington. He received it with the calm that bespoke a mighty\r\nsoul; for, as Sir A. Frazer observed, however indifferent or\r\napparently careless he might appear at the beginning of battles, as\r\nthe crisis came he rose superior to all that could be imagined. Such\r\nwas his demeanour now. Riding to the Brunswickers posted in reserve,\r\nhe led them to the post of danger; Kennedy rallied the wrecks of\r\nAlten's division and brought up Germans from the left wing; the\r\ncavalry of Vandeleur and Vivian, moving in from the extreme left, also\r\nhelped to steady the centre; and the approach of Chassé's\r\nDutch-Belgian brigade, lately called in from Braine-la-Leud,\r\nstrengthened our supports.\r\n\r\nHad Napoleon promptly launched his Old and Middle Guard at\r\nWellington's centre, victory might still have crowned the French\r\neagles. But to Ney's request for more troops he returned the petulant\r\nanswer: \"Troops? where do you want me to get them from? Am I to make\r\nthem?\" At this time the Prussians were again masters of Planchenoit.\r\nOnce more, then, he turned on them, and sent in two battalions, one of\r\nthe Old, the other of the Middle Guard. In a single rush with the\r\nbayonet these veterans mastered the place and drove Bülow's men a\r\nquarter of a mile beyond, while Lobau regained ground further north.\r\nBut the head of Pirch's corps was near at hand to strengthen Bülow;\r\nwhile, after long delays caused by miry lanes and an order from\r\nBlücher to make for Planchenoit, Ziethen's corps began to menace the\r\nFrench right at Smohain. Reiche soon opened fire with sixteen cannon,\r\nsomewhat relieving the pressure on Wellington's left.[520]\r\n\r\nStill the Emperor was full of hope. He did not know of the approach of\r\nPirch and Ziethen. Now and again the muttering of Grouchy's guns was\r\nheard on the east, and despite that Marshal's last despatch, Napoleon\r\nstill believed that he would come up and catch the Prussians.\r\nSatisfied, then, with holding off Bülow for a while, he staked all on\r\na last effort with the Old and Middle Guard. Leaving two battalions of\r\nthese in Planchenoit, and three near Rossomme as a last reserve, he\r\nled forward nine battalions formed in hollow squares. A thrill ran\r\nthrough the line regiments, some of whom were falling back, as they\r\nsaw the bearskins move forward; and, to revive their spirits, the\r\nEmperor sent on Labédoyère with the news that Grouchy was at hand.\r\n\r\nThus the tension of hope long deferred, which renders Waterloo unique\r\namong battles, rose to its climax. Each side had striven furiously for\r\neight hours in the belief that the Prussians, or Grouchy, must come;\r\nand now, at the last agony, came the assurance that final triumph was\r\nat hand. The troops of D'Erlon and Reille once more clutched at\r\nvictory on the crest behind La Haye Sainte or beneath the walls of\r\nHougoumont, while the squares of the Guard struck obliquely across the\r\nvale in the track of the great cavalry charges. On the rise south-west\r\nof La Haye Sainte, Napoleon halted one battalion and handed over to\r\nNey the command of the remaining eight, that hailed him as they passed\r\nwith enthusiastic shouts. Two aides-de-camp just then galloped up from\r\nthe right to tell him of the Prussian advance, but he refused to\r\nlisten to them and bent his eyes on the Guards.[521]\r\n\r\nUnder cover of a whirlwind of shot the veterans pressed on. Having\r\nsuffered very little at Ligny, they numbered fully 4,000, and formed\r\nat first one column, some seventy men in width. The front battalions\r\nheaded for a point a little to the west of the present Belgian\r\nmonument, while for some unexplained reason the rear portion diverged\r\nto the left, and breasted the slope later than the others and nearer\r\nHougoumont. Flanked by light guns that opened a brisk fire, and most\r\ngallantly supported by Donzelot's division close on their right, the\r\nleading column struggled on, despite the grape and canister which\r\npoured from the batteries of Bolton and Bean, making it wave \"like\r\ncorn blown by the wind.\" Friant, the Commander of the Old Guard, was\r\nseverely wounded; Ney's horse fell under him, but the gallant fighter\r\nrose undaunted, and waved on his men anew. And now they streamed over\r\nthe ridge and through the British guns in full assurance of triumph.\r\nFew troops seemed to be before them; for Maitland's men (2nd and 3rd\r\nbattalions of the 1st Foot Guards) had lain down behind the bank of\r\nthe cross-road to get some shelter from the awful cannonade. \"Stand\r\nup, Guards, and make ready,\" exclaimed the Duke when the French were\r\nbut sixty paces away. The volley that flashed from their lengthy front\r\nstaggered the column, and seemed to force it bodily back. In vain did\r\nthe French officers wave their swords and attempt to deploy into line.\r\nMangled in front by Maitland's brigade, on its flank by our 33rd and\r\n69th Regiments drawn up in square, and by the deadly salvos of\r\nChassé's Dutch-Belgians,[522] that stately array shrank and shrivelled\r\nup. \"Now's the time, my boys,\" shouted Lord Saltoun; and the thin red\r\nline, closing with the mass, drove it pell-mell down the slope.\r\n\r\nNear the foot the victors fell under the fire of the rear portion of\r\nthe Imperial Guards, who, undaunted by their comrades' repulse, rolled\r\nmajestically upwards. Colborne now wheeled the 52nd (Oxfordshire)\r\nRegiment on the crest in a line nearly parallel to their advance, and\r\nopened a deadly fire on their flank, which was hotly returned;\r\nMaitland's men, re-forming on the crest, gave them a volley in front;\r\nand some Hanoverians at the rear of Hougoumont also galled their rear.\r\nSeizing the favourable moment when the column writhed in anguish,\r\nColborne cheered his men to the charge, and, aided by the second 95th\r\nRifles, utterly overthrew the last hope of France. Continuing his\r\nadvance, and now supported by the 71st Regiment, he swept our front\r\nclear as far as the orchard of La Haye Sainte.[523]\r\n\r\nThe Emperor had at first watched the charge with feelings of buoyant\r\nhope; for Friant, who came back wounded, reported that success was\r\ncertain. As the truth forced itself on him, he turned pale as a\r\ncorpse. \"Why! they are in confusion,\" he exclaimed; \"all is lost for\r\nthe present.\" A thrill of agony also shot through the French lines.\r\nDonzelot's onset had at one time staggered Halkett's brigade; but the\r\nhopes aroused by the charge of the Guard and the rumour of Grouchy's\r\napproach gave place to dismay when the veterans fell back and\r\nZiethen's Prussians debouched from Papelotte. To the cry of \"The Guard\r\ngives way,\" there succeeded shouts of \"treason.\" The Duke, noting the\r\nconfusion, waved on his whole line to the longed-for advance. Menaced\r\nin front by the thin red line, and in rear by Colborne's glorious\r\ncharge, D'Erlon's divisions broke up in general rout. For a time,\r\nthree rocks stood boldly forth above this disastrous ebb. They were\r\nthe battalions of the Guard previously repulsed, and that had rallied\r\naround the Emperor on the rise south of La Haye Sainte. In front of\r\nthem the three regiments of Adam's brigade stopped to re-form; but at\r\nthe Duke's command--\"Go on, go on: they will not stand\"--Colborne\r\ncharged them, and they gave way.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as the sun shot its last gleams over the field, the swords of\r\nthe British horsemen were seen to flash and fall with relentless\r\nvigour. The brigades of Vandeleur and Vivian, well husbanded during\r\nthe day, had been slipped upon the foe. The effect was electrical. The\r\nretreat became a rout that surged wildly around the last squares of\r\nthe Guard. In one of them Napoleon took refuge for a space, still\r\nhoping to effect a rally, while outside Ney rushed from band to band,\r\nbrandishing a broken sword, foaming with fury, and launching at the\r\nrunaways the taunt, \"Cowards! have you forgotten how to die?\"[524]\r\n\r\nBut panic now reigned supreme. Adam's brigade was at hand to support\r\nour horsemen; and shortly after nine there knelled from Planchenoit\r\nthe last stroke of doom, the shouts of Prussians at last victorious\r\nover the stubborn defence. \"The Guard dies and does not\r\nsurrender\"--such are the words attributed by some to Michel, by others\r\nto Cambronne before he was stretched senseless on the ground.[525]\r\nWhether spoken or not, some such thought prompted whole companies to\r\ndie for the honour of their flag. And their chief, why did he not\r\nshare their glorious fate? Gourgaud says that Soult forced him from\r\nthe field. If so (and Houssaye discredits the story) Soult never\r\nserved his master worse. The only dignified course was to act up to\r\nhis recent proclamation that the time had come for every Frenchman of\r\nspirit to conquer or die. To belie those words by an ignominious\r\nflight was to court the worst of sins in French political life,\r\nridicule.\r\n\r\nAnd the flight was ignominious. Wellington's weary troops, after\r\nseveral times mistaking friends for foes in the dusk, halted south of\r\nRossomme and handed over the pursuit to the Prussians, many of whom\r\nhad fought but little and now drank deep the draught of revenge. By\r\nthe light of the rising moon Gneisenau led on his horsemen in a\r\npursuit compared with which that of Jena was tame. At Genappe Napoleon\r\nhoped to make a stand: but the place was packed with wagons and\r\nthronged with men struggling to get at the narrow bridge. At the blare\r\nof the Prussian trumpets, the panic became frightful; the Emperor left\r\nhis carriage and took to horse as the hurrahs drew near. Seven times\r\ndid the French form bivouacs, and seven times were they driven out and\r\naway. At Quatre Bras he once more sought to gather a few troops; but\r\nere he could do so the Uhlans came on. With tears trickling down his\r\npallid cheeks, he resumed his flight over another field of carnage,\r\nwhere ghastly forms glinted on all sides under the pale light of dawn.\r\nAfter further futile efforts at Charleroi, he hurried on towards\r\nParis, followed at some distance by groups amounting to about 10,000\r\nmen, the sorry remnant still under arms of the host that fought at\r\nWaterloo: 25,000 lay dead or wounded there: some thousands were taken\r\nprisoners: the rest were scattering to their homes. Wellington lost\r\n10,360 killed and wounded, of whom 6,344 were British: the Prussian\r\nloss was about 6,000 men.\r\n\r\nThe causes of Napoleon's overthrow are not hard to find. The lack of\r\ntimely pursuit of Blücher and Wellington on the 17th enabled those\r\nleaders to secure posts of vantage and to form an incisive plan which\r\nhe did not fully fathom even at the crisis of the battle. Full of\r\noverweening contempt of Wellington, he began the fight heedlessly and\r\nwastefully. When the Prussians came on, he underrated their strength\r\nand believed to the very end that Grouchy would come up and take them\r\nbetween two fires. But, in the absence of prompt, clear, and detailed\r\ninstructions, that Marshal was left a prey to his fatal notion that\r\nWavre was the one point to be aimed at and attacked. Despite the heavy\r\ncannonade on the west he persisted in this strange course; while\r\nNapoleon staked everything on a supreme effort against Wellington.\r\nThis last was an act of appalling hardihood; but he explained to\r\nCockburn on the voyage to St. Helena that, still confiding in\r\nGrouchy's approach, he felt no uneasiness at the Prussian movements,\r\n\"which were, in fact, already checked, and that he considered the\r\nbattle to have been, on the whole, rather in his favour than\r\notherwise.\" The explanation has every appearance of sincerity. But\r\nwould any other great commander have staked his last reserve and laid\r\nbare his rear solely in reliance on the ability of an almost untried\r\nleader who had sent not a single word that justified the hopes now\r\nplaced in him?\r\n\r\nWe here touch the weak points in Napoleon's intellectual armour.\r\nGifted with almost superhuman insight and energy himself, he too often\r\ncredited his paladins with possessing the same divine afflatus.\r\nFurthermore, he had a supreme contempt for his enemies. Victorious in\r\na hundred fights over second-rate opponents in his youth, he could not\r\nnow school his hardened faculties to the caution needed in a contest\r\nwith Wellington, Gneisenau, and Blücher. Only after he had ruined\r\nhimself and France did he realize his own errors and the worth of the\r\nallied leaders. During the voyage to England he confessed to Bertrand:\r\n\"The Duke of Wellington is fully equal to myself in the management of\r\nan army, _with the advantage of possessing more prudence_.\"[526]\r\n\r\n    NOTE ADDED TO THE FOURTH EDITION.--I have discussed several of the\r\n    vexed questions of the Waterloo Campaign in an Essay, \"The\r\n    Prussian Co-operation at Waterloo,\" in my volume entitled\r\n    \"Napoleonic Studies\" (George Bell and Sons, 1904). In that Essay I\r\n    have pointed out the inaccuracy or exaggeration of the claims put\r\n    forward by some German writers to the effect that (1) Wellington\r\n    played Blücher false at Ligny, (2) that he did not expect Prussian\r\n    help until late in the day at Waterloo, (3) that the share of\r\n    credit for the victory rested in overwhelming measure with Blücher\r\n    and Gneisenau.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nFROM THE ELYSÉE TO ST. HELENA\r\n\r\n\r\nNapoleon was far from accepting Waterloo as a final blow. At\r\nPhilippeville on the day after the battle, he wrote to his brother\r\nJoseph that he would speedily have 300,000 men ready to defend France:\r\nhe would harness his guns with carriage-horses, raise 100,000\r\nconscripts, and arm them with muskets taken from the royalists and\r\nmalcontent National Guards: he would arouse Dauphiné, Lyonnais, and\r\nBurgundy, and overwhelm the enemy. \"But the people must help me and\r\nnot bewilder me.... Write to me what effect this horrible piece of bad\r\nluck has had on the Chamber. I believe the deputies will feel\r\nconvinced that their duty in this crowning moment is to rally round me\r\nand save France.\"[527]\r\n\r\nThe tenacious will, then, is only bent, not broken. Waterloo is merely\r\na greater La Rothière, calling for a mightier defensive effort than\r\nthat of 1814. Such are his intentions, even when he knows not that\r\nGrouchy is escaping from the Prussians. The letter breathes a firm\r\nresolve. He has no scruples as to the wickedness of spurring on a\r\nwearied people to a conflict with Europe. As yet he forms no\r\nmagnanimous resolve to take leave of a nation whom his genius may once\r\nmore excite to a fatal frenzy. He still seems unable to conceive of\r\nFrance happy and prosperous apart from himself. In indissoluble union\r\nthey will struggle on and defy the world.\r\n\r\nSuch was the frame of mind in which he reached the Elysée Palace early\r\non the 21st of June. For a time he was much agitated. \"Oh, my God!\" he\r\nexclaimed to Lavalette, raising his eyes to heaven and walking up and\r\ndown the room. But after taking a warm bath--his unfailing remedy for\r\nfatigue--he became calm and discussed with the Ministers plans of a\r\nnational defence. The more daring advised the prorogation of the\r\nChambers and the declaration of a state of siege in Paris; but others\r\ndemurred to a step that would lead to civil war. The Council dragged\r\non at great length, the Emperor only once rousing himself from his\r\nweariness to declare that all was not lost; that _he_, and not the\r\nChambers, could save France. If so, he should have gone to the\r\ndeputies, thrilled them with that commanding voice, or dissolved them\r\nat once. Montholon states that this course was recommended by\r\nCambacérès, Carnot, and Maret, but that most of the Ministers urged\r\nhim not to expose his wearied frame to the storms of an excited\r\nassembly. At St. Helena he told Gourgaud that, despite his fatigue, he\r\nwould have made the effort had he thought success possible, but he did\r\nnot.[528]\r\n\r\nThe Chamber of Deputies meanwhile was acting with vigour. Agonized by\r\nthe tales of disaster already spread abroad by wounded soldiers, it\r\neagerly assented to Lafayette's proposal to sit in permanence and\r\ndeclare any attempt at dissolution an act of high treason. So\r\nunblenching a defiance, which recalled the Tennis Court Oath of\r\ntwenty-six years before, struck the Emperor almost dumb with\r\nastonishment. Lucien bade him prepare for a _coup d'état_: but\r\nNapoleon saw that the days for such an act were passed. He had\r\nsquandered the physical and moral resources bequeathed by the\r\nRevolution. Its armies were mouldering under the soil of Spain,\r\nRussia, Germany, and Belgium; and a decade of reckless ambition had\r\nworn to tatters Rousseau's serviceable theory of a military\r\ndictatorship. Exhausted France was turning away from him to the prime\r\nsource of liberty, her representatives.\r\n\r\nThese were doubtless the thoughts that coursed through his brain as he\r\npaced with Lucien up and down the garden of the Elysée. A crowd of\r\n_fédérés_ and workmen outside cheered him frantically. He saluted them\r\nwith a smile; but, says Pasquier, \"the expression of his eyes showed\r\nthe sadness that filled his soul.\" True, he might have led that\r\nunthinking rabble against the Chambers; but that would mean civil war,\r\nand from this he shrank. Still Lucien bade him strike. \"Dare,\" he\r\nwhispered with Dantonesque terseness. \"Alas,\" replied his brother, \"I\r\nhave dared only too much already.\" Davoust also opined that it was too\r\nlate now that the deputies had firmly seized the reins and were\r\nprotected by the National Guards of Paris.\r\n\r\nAnd so Napoleon let matters drift. In truth, he was \"bewildered\" by\r\nthe disunion of France. It was a France that he knew not, a land given\r\nover to _idéalogues_ and traitors. His own Minister, Fouché, was\r\nworking to sap his power, and yet he dared not have him shot! What\r\nwonder that the helpless autocrat paced restlessly to and fro, or sat\r\nas in a dream! In the evening Carnot went to the Peers, Lucien to the\r\nDeputies, to appeal for a united national effort against the\r\nCoalition, but the simple earnestness of the one and the fraternal\r\nfervour of the other alike failed. When Lucien finally exclaimed\r\nagainst any desertion of Napoleon, Lafayette fiercely shot at him the\r\nlong tale of costly sacrifices which France had offered up at the\r\nshrine of Napoleon's glory, and concluded: \"We have done enough for\r\nhim: our duty is to save _la patrie_.\"\r\n\r\nOn the morrow came the news that Grouchy had escaped from the\r\nPrussians; and that the relics of Napoleon's host were rallying at\r\nLaon. But would not this encouragement embolden the Emperor to crush\r\nthe contumacious Chambers? Evidently the case was urgent. He must\r\nabdicate, or they would dethrone him--such was the purport of their\r\nmessage to the Elysée; but, as an act of grace, they allowed him _an\r\nhour_ in which to forestall their action. Shortly after midday, on the\r\nadvice of his Ministers, he took the final step of his official\r\ncareer. Lucien and Carnot begged him for some time to abdicate only in\r\nfavour of his son;[529] and he did so, but with the bitter remark: \"My\r\nson! What a chimera! No, it is for the Bourbons that I abdicate! They\r\nat least are not prisoners at Vienna.\"\r\n\r\nThe deputies were of his opinion. Despite frantic efforts of the\r\nBonapartists, they passed over Napoleon II. without any effective\r\nrecognition, and at once appointed an executive Commission of\r\nfive--Carnot, Caulaincourt, Fouché, Grenier, and Quinette. Three of\r\nthem were regicides, and Fouché was chosen their President. We can\r\ngauge Napoleon's wrath at seeing matters thus promptly rolled back to\r\nwhere they were before Brumaire by his biting comment that he had made\r\nway for the King of Rome, not for a Directory which included one\r\ntraitor and two babies. His indignation was just. An abdication forced\r\non by _idéalogues_ was hateful; to be succeeded by Fouché seemed an\r\nunforgivable insult; but he touched the lowest depth of humiliation on\r\nthe 25th, when he received from that despicable schemer an order to\r\nleave Paris.\r\n\r\nHe obeyed on that first Sunday after Waterloo, driving off quietly to\r\nMalmaison, there to be joined by Hortense Beauharnais and a few\r\nfaithful friends. At that ill-omened abode, where Josephine had\r\nbreathed her last shortly after his first abdication, he spent four\r\nuneasy days. At times he was full of fight. He sent to the \"Moniteur\"\r\na proclamation urging the army to make \"some efforts more, and the\r\nCoalition will be dissolved.\" The manifesto was suppressed by Fouché's\r\norders.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the invaders pressed on rapidly towards Compiègne. They met\r\nwith no attempts at a national rising, a fact which proves the welcome\r\naccorded to Napoleon in March to have been mainly the outcome of\r\nmilitary devotion and of the dislike generally felt for the Bourbons.\r\nIt is a libel on the French people to suppose that a truly national\r\nimpulse in his favour would have vanished with a single defeat. In\r\nvain did the Provisional Government sue for an armistice that would\r\nstay the advance. Wellington refused outright; but Blücher declared\r\nthat he would consider the matter if Napoleon were handed over to him,\r\n_dead or alive_. On hearing of this, Wellington at once wrote his ally\r\na private remonstrance, which drew from Gneisenau a declaration that,\r\nas the Duke was held back _by parliamentary considerations and by the\r\nwish to prolong the life of the villain whose career had extended\r\nEngland's power_, the Prussians would see to it that Napoleon was\r\nhanded over to them for execution conformably to the declaration of\r\nthe Congress of Vienna.[530]\r\n\r\nBut the Provisional Government acted honestly towards Napoleon. On the\r\n26th Fouché sent General Becker to watch over him and advise him to\r\nset out for Rochefort, _en route_ to the United States, for which\r\npurpose passports were being asked from Wellington. Becker found the\r\nex-Emperor a prey to quickly varying moods. At one time he seemed\r\n\"sunk into a kind of _mollesse_, and very careful about his ease and\r\ncomfort\": he ate hugely at meals: or again he affected a rather coarse\r\njoviality, showing his regard for Becker by pulling his ear. His plans\r\nvaried with his moods. He declared he would throw himself into the\r\nmiddle of France and fight to the end, or that he would take ship at\r\nRochefort with Bertrand and Savary alone, and steal past the English\r\nsquadron; but when Mme. Bertrand exclaimed that this would be cruel to\r\nher, he readily gave up the scheme.[531]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to gauge his feelings at this time. Apart from one\r\noutburst to Lavalette of pity for France, he seems not to have\r\nrealized how unspeakably disastrous his influence had been on the land\r\nwhich he found in a victoriously expansive phase, and now left\r\nprostrate at the feet of the allies and the Bourbons. Hatred and\r\ncontempt of the upper classes for their \"fickle\" desertion of him,\r\nthese, if we may judge from his frequent allusions to the topic during\r\nthe voyage, were the feelings uppermost in his mind; and this may\r\nexplain why he wavered between the thought of staking all on a last\r\neffort against the allies and the plan of renewing in America the\r\ncareer now closed to him in Europe.\r\n\r\nHe certainly was not a prey to torpor and dumb despair. His brain\r\nstill clutched eagerly at public affairs, as if unable to realize that\r\nthey had slipped beyond his control; and his behaviour showed that he\r\nwas still _un être politique_, with whom power was all in all. He\r\nevinced few signs of deep emotion on bidding farewell to his devoted\r\nfollowers: but whether this resulted from inner hardness, or\r\nresentment at his fall, or a sense of dignified prudence, it is\r\nimpossible to say. When Denon, the designer of his medals, sobbed on\r\nbidding him adieu, he remarked: _Mon cher, ne nous attendrissons pas:\r\nil faut dans les crises comme celle-ci se conduire avec froid_. This\r\nsurely was one source of his power over an emotional people: his\r\nfeelings were the servant, not the master, of his reason.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Prussians were drawing near to Paris. Early on the 29th\r\nthey were at Argenteuil, and Blücher detached a flying column to seize\r\nthe bridge of Chatou over the Seine near Malmaison and carry off\r\nNapoleon on the following night. But Davoust and Fouché warded off the\r\ndanger. While the Marshal had the nearest bridges of the Seine\r\nbarricaded or burnt, Fouché on the night of the 28th-29th sent an\r\norder to Napoleon to leave at once for Rochefort and set sail with two\r\nfrigates, even though the English passports had not arrived.\r\n\r\nHe received the news calmly, and then with unusual animation requested\r\nBecker to submit to the Government a scheme for rapidly rallying the\r\ntroops around Paris, whereupon he, _as General Bonaparte_, would\r\nsurprise first Blücher and then Wellington--they were two days'\r\nmarches apart: then, after routing the foe, he would resume his\r\njourney to the coast. The Commission would have none of it. The\r\nreports showed that the French troops were so demoralized that success\r\nwas not to be hoped for.[532] And if a second Montmirail were snatched\r\nfrom Blücher, would it bring more of glory to Napoleon or of useless\r\nbloodshed to France? Those who look on the world as an arena for the\r\nexploits of heroes at the cost of ordinary mortals may applaud the\r\nscheme. But could men who were responsible to France regard it as\r\nanything but a final proof of Napoleon's perverse optimism, or a flash\r\nof his unquenchable ambition, or a last mad bid for power? He showed\r\nsigns of anger on hearing of their refusal, but set out for Rochefort\r\nat 6 p.m.; and thus the Prussians were cheated of their prey by a few\r\nhours. Bertrand, Savary, Gourgaud, and Becker accompanied him.\r\n\r\nThe cheers of troops and people at Niort, and again at Rochefort,\r\nwhere he arrived on July 3rd, re-awakened his fighting instincts; and\r\nas the westerly winds precluded all hope of the two frigates slipping\r\nquickly down either of the practicable outlets so as to elude the\r\nBritish cruisers, he again sought permission to take command of the\r\nFrench forces, now beginning to fall back from Paris behind the line\r\nof the Loire. Again his offer was refused; and messages came thick and\r\nfast bidding Becker get him away from the mainland. Such was the\r\ndesire of his best friends. Paris capitulated to the allies on July\r\n4th, and both French royalists and Prussians were eager to get hold of\r\nhim. Thus, while he sat weaving plans of a campaign on the Loire, the\r\ntottering Government at Paris pressed on his embarkation, hinting that\r\nforce would be used should further delays ensue. Sadly, then, on July\r\n8th, he went on board the \"Saale,\" moored near L'Ile d'Aix, opposite\r\nthe mouth of the Charente.\r\n\r\nHe was now in sore straits. The orders from Paris expressly forbade\r\nhis setting foot again on the mainland, and most of the great towns\r\nhad already hoisted the white flag. In front of him was the Bay of\r\nBiscay, swept by British cruisers, which the French naval officers had\r\nscant hopes of escaping. There was talk among Napoleon's suite, which\r\nnow included Montholon, Las Cases, and Lallemand, of attempting flight\r\nfrom the Gironde, or in the hold of a small Danish sloop then at\r\nRochefort, or on two fishing boats moored to the north of L'Ile de Ré;\r\nbut these plans were given up in consequence of the close watch kept\r\nby our cruisers at all points. The next day brought with it a despatch\r\nfrom Paris ordering the ex-Emperor to set sail within twenty-four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow Napoleon sent Savary and Las Cases with a letter to\r\nH.M.S. \"Bellerophon,\" then cruising off the main channel--that between\r\nthe islands of Oléron and Ré--asking whether the permits for\r\nNapoleon's voyage to America had arrived, or his departure would be\r\nprevented. Savary also inquired whether his passage on a merchant-ship\r\nwould be stopped. The commander, Captain Maitland, had received strict\r\norders to intercept Napoleon; but, seeking to gain time and to bring\r\nAdmiral Hotham up with other ships, he replied that he would oppose\r\nthe frigates by force: neither could he permit Napoleon to set sail on\r\na merchant-ship until he had the warrant of his admiral for so doing.\r\nThe \"Bellerophon,\" \"Myrmidon,\" and \"Slaney\" now drew closer in to\r\nguard the middle channel, while a corvette watched each of the\r\ndifficult outlets on the north and south.[533]\r\n\r\nThree days of sorrow and suspense now ensued. On the 12th came the\r\nnews of the entry of Louis XVIII. into Paris, the collapse of the\r\nProvisional Government, and the general hoisting of the _fleur-de-lys_\r\nthroughout France. On the 13th Joseph Bonaparte came for a last\r\ninterview with his brother on the Ile d'Aix. Montholon states that the\r\nex-King offered to change places with the ex-Emperor and thus allow\r\nhim the chance of escaping on a neutral ship from the Gironde.\r\nGourgaud does not refer to any such offer, nor does Bertrand in his\r\nletter of July 14th to Joseph. In any case, it was not put to the\r\ntest; for royalism was rampant on the mainland, and two of our\r\ncruisers hovered about the Gironde. Sadly the two brothers parted, and\r\nfor ever. Then the other schemes were again mooted only to be given up\r\nonce more; and late on the 13th Napoleon dictated the following\r\nletter, to be taken by Gourgaud to the Prince Regent:\r\n\r\n    \"Exposed to the factions which distract my country and to the\r\n    enmity of the greatest Powers of Europe, I have closed my\r\n    political career, and I come, like Themistocles, to throw myself\r\n    upon the hospitality of the British people. I put myself under the\r\n    protection of their laws, which I claim from your Royal Highness,\r\n    as the most powerful, the most constant, and the most generous of\r\n    my enemies.\"[534]\r\n\r\nOn the 14th Gourgaud and Las Cases took this letter to the\r\n\"Bellerophon,\" whereupon Maitland assured them that he would convey\r\nNapoleon to England, Gourgaud preceding them on the \"Slaney\"; but that\r\nthe ex-Emperor _would be entirely at the disposal of our Government_.\r\nThis last was made perfectly clear to Las Cases, who understood\r\nEnglish, though at first he feigned not to do so; but, unfortunately,\r\nMaitland did not exact from him a written acknowledgment of this\r\nunderstanding. Gourgaud was transferred to the \"Slaney,\" which soon\r\nset sail for Torbay, while Las Cases reported to Napoleon on L'Ile\r\nd'Aix what had happened. Thereupon Bertrand wrote to Maitland that\r\nNapoleon would come on board on the morrow:\r\n\r\n    \" ... If the Admiral, in consequence of the demand that you have\r\n    addressed to him, sends you the permits for the United States, His\r\n    Majesty will go there with pleasure; but in default of them, he\r\n    will go voluntarily to England as a private individual to enjoy\r\n    the protection of the laws of your country.\"\r\n\r\nNow, either Las Cases misinterpreted Maitland's words and acts, or\r\nNapoleon hoped to impose on the captain by the statements just quoted.\r\nMaitland had not sent to Hotham for permits; he held out no hopes of\r\nNapoleon's going to America; he only promised to take him to England\r\n_to be at the disposal of the Prince Regent_. Napoleon, taking no\r\nnotice of the last stipulation, now promised to go to England, not as\r\nEmperor, but as a private individual. He took this step soon after\r\ndawn on the 15th, when any lingering hopes of his escape were ended by\r\nthe sight of Admiral Hotham's ship, \"Superb,\" in the offing. On\r\nleaving the French brig, \"Epervier,\" he was greeted with the last\r\ncheers of _Vive l'Empereur_, cheers that died away almost in a wail as\r\nhis boat drew near to the \"Bellerophon.\" There he was greeted\r\nrespectfully, but without a salute. He wore the green uniform, with\r\ngold and scarlet facings, of a colonel of the Chasseurs à Cheval of\r\nthe Guard, with white waistcoat and military boots; and Maitland\r\nthought him \"a remarkably strong, well-built man.\" Keeping up a\r\ncheerful demeanour, he asked a number of questions about the ship, and\r\nrequested to be shown round even thus early, while the men were\r\nwashing the decks. He inquired whether the \"Bellerophon\" would have\r\nworsted the two French frigates and acquiesced in Maitland's\r\naffirmative reply. He expressed admiration of all that he saw,\r\nincluding the portrait of Maitland's wife hanging in the cabin; and\r\nthe captain felt the full force of that seductive gift of pleasing,\r\nwhich was not the least important of the great man's powers.\r\n\r\nHe was accompanied by General and Mme. Bertrand, the former a tall,\r\nslim, good-looking man, of refined manners and domestic habits, though\r\nof a sensitive and hasty temper; his wife, a lady of slight figure,\r\nbut stately carriage, the daughter of a Irishman named Dillon, who\r\nlost his life in the Revolution. Her vivacious manners bespoke a warm\r\nimpulsive nature, that had revelled in the splendour of her high\r\nceremonial station and now seemed strained beyond endurance by the\r\ntrials threatening her and her three children. The Bertrands had been\r\nwith Napoleon at Elba, and enjoyed his complete confidence. Younger\r\nthan they were General (Count) Montholon and his wife--he, a short but\r\nhandsome man, his consort, a sweet unassuming woman--who showed their\r\ndevotion to the ex-Emperor by exchanging a life of luxury for exile in\r\nhis service. Count Las Cases, a small man, whose thin eager face and\r\nfurtive glances revealed his bent for intrigue, was the eldest of the\r\nparty. He had been a naval officer, had then lived in England as an\r\n_émigré_, but after the Peace of Amiens took civil service under\r\nNapoleon; he now brought with him his son, a lad of fifteen, fresh\r\nfrom the Lycée. We need not notice the figures of Savary and\r\nLallemand, as they were soon to part company. Maingaud the surgeon,\r\nMarchand the head valet, several servants, and the bright little boy\r\nof the Montholons completed the list.\r\n\r\nThe voyage passed without incident. Napoleon's health and appetite\r\nwere on the whole excellent, and he suffered less than the rest from\r\nsea-sickness. The delicate Las Cases, who had donned his naval\r\nuniform, was in such distress as to move the mirth of the crew,\r\nwhereupon Napoleon sharply bade him appear in plain clothes so as not\r\nto disgrace the French navy. For the great man himself the crew soon\r\nfelt a very real regard, witness the final confession of one of them\r\nto Maitland: \"Well, they may abuse that man as much as they like, but\r\nif the people of England knew him as well as we do, they would not\r\nhurt a hair of his head.\"--What a tribute this to the mysterious power\r\nof genius!\r\n\r\nOn passing Ushant, he remained long upon deck, silent and abstracted,\r\ncasting melancholy looks at the land he was never more to see. As they\r\nneared Torbay, the exile was loud in praise of the beauty of the\r\nscene, which he compared with that of Porto Ferrajo. Whatever\r\nmisgivings he felt before embarking on the \"Bellerophon\" had\r\napparently disappeared. He had been treated with every courtesy and\r\nhad met with only one rebuff. He prompted Mme. Bertrand, who spoke\r\nEnglish well, to sound Maitland as to the acceptance of a box\r\ncontaining his (Napoleon's) portrait set in diamonds. This the captain\r\nvery properly refused.[535]\r\n\r\nIn Torbay troubles began to thicken upon the party. Gourgaud rejoined\r\nthem on the 24th: he had not been allowed to land. Orders came on the\r\n26th for the \"Bellerophon\" to proceed to Plymouth; and the rumour\r\ngained ground that St. Helena would be their destination. It was true.\r\nOn July 31st, Sir Henry Bunbury, Secretary to the Admiralty, and Lord\r\nKeith, Admiral in command at Plymouth, laid before him in writing the\r\ndecision of our Government, that, in order to prevent any further\r\ndisturbance to the peace of Europe, it had been decided to restrain\r\nhis liberty--\"to whatever extent may be necessary for securing that\r\nfirst and paramount object\"--and that St. Helena would be his place of\r\nresidence, as it was healthy, and would admit of a smaller degree of\r\nrestraint than might be necessary elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAgainst this he made a lengthy protest, declaring that he was not a\r\nprisoner of war, that he came as a passenger on the \"Bellerophon\"\r\n\"after a previous negotiation with the commander,\" that he demanded\r\nthe rights of a British citizen, and wished to settle in a country\r\nhouse far from the sea, where he would submit to the surveillance of a\r\ncommissioner over his actions and correspondence. St. Helena would\r\nkill him in three months, for he was wont to ride twenty leagues a\r\nday; he preferred death to St. Helena. Maitland's conduct had been a\r\ndeliberate snare. To deprive him (Napoleon) of his liberty would be an\r\neternal disgrace to England; for in coming to our shores he had\r\noffered the Prince Regent the finest page of his history.--Our\r\nofficials then bowed and withdrew. He recalled Keith, and when the\r\nlatter remarked that to go to St. Helena was better than being sent to\r\nLouis XVIII. or to Russia, the captive exclaimed \"Russia! God keep me\r\nfrom that.\"[536]\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to traverse his statements at length. The foregoing\r\nrecital of facts will have shown that he was completely at the end of\r\nhis resources, and that Maitland had not made a single stipulation as\r\nto his reception in England. Indeed, Napoleon never reproached\r\nMaitland; he left that to Las Cases to do; and the captain easily\r\nrefuted these insinuations, with the approval of Montholon. If there\r\nwas any misunderstanding, it was certainly due to Las Cases.[537]\r\n\r\nIndeed, the thought of Napoleon settling dully down in the Midlands is\r\nludicrous. How could a man who revelled in vast schemes, whose mind\r\npreyed on itself if there were no facts and figures to grind, or\r\ndifficulties to overcome, ever sink to the level of a Justice Shallow?\r\nAnd if he longed for repose, would the Opposition in England and the\r\nmalcontents in France have let him rest? Inevitably he would become a\r\nrallying point for all the malcontents of Europe. Besides, our\r\nengagements to the allies bound us to guard him securely; and we were\r\nunder few personal obligations to a man who, during the Peace of\r\nAmiens, persistently urged us to drive forth the Bourbons from our\r\nland, who at its close forcibly detained 10,000 Britons in defiance of\r\nthe law of nations, and whose ambition added £600,000,000 to our\r\nNational Debt.\r\n\r\nMinisters had decided on St. Helena by July 28th. Their decision was\r\nclinched by a Memorandum of General Beatson, late Governor of the\r\nisland, dated July 29th, recommending St. Helena, because all the\r\nlanding places were protected by batteries, and the semaphores\r\nrecently placed on the lofty cliffs would enable the approach of a\r\nrescue squadron to be descried sixty miles off, and the news to be\r\nspeedily signalled to the Governor's House. Napoleon's appeal and\r\nprotests were accordingly passed over; and, in pursuance of advice\r\njust to hand from Castlereagh at Paris, Ministers decided to treat\r\nhim, not as our prisoner, but as the prisoner of all the Powers. A\r\nConvention was set in hand as to his detention; it was signed on\r\nAugust 2nd at Paris, and bound the other Powers to send Commissioners\r\nas witnesses to the safety of the custody.[538]\r\n\r\nHis departure from Plymouth was hastened by curious incidents. Crowds\r\nof people assembled there to see the great man, and shoals of\r\nboats--Maitland says more than a thousand on fine days--struggled and\r\njostled to get as near the \"Bellerophon\" as the guard-boats would\r\nallow. Two or three persons were drowned; but still the swarm pressed\r\non. Many of the men wore carnations--a hopeful sign this seemed to Las\r\nCases--and the women waved their handkerchiefs when he appeared on the\r\npoop or at the open gangway. Maitland was warned that a rescue would\r\nbe attempted on the night of the 3rd-4th; and certainly the Frenchmen\r\nwere very restless at that time. They believed that if Napoleon could\r\nonly set foot on shore he must gain the rights of Habeas Corpus.[539]\r\nAnd there seemed some chance of his gaining them. Very early on August\r\n4th a man came down from London bringing a subpoena from the Court of\r\nKing's Bench to compel Lord Keith and Captain Maitland to produce the\r\nperson of Napoleon Bonaparte for attendance in London as witness in a\r\ntrial for libel then pending. It appears that some one was to be sued\r\nfor a libel on a naval officer, censuring his conduct in the West\r\nIndies; and it was suggested that if he (the defendant) could get\r\nNapoleon's evidence to prove that the French ships were at that time\r\nunserviceable, his case would be strengthened. An attorney therefore\r\ncame down to Plymouth armed with a subpoena, with which he chased\r\nKeith on land and chased him by sea, until his panting rowers were\r\nfoiled by the stout crew of the Admiral's barge. Keith also found\r\nmeans to let Maitland know how matters stood early on the 4th,\r\nwhereupon the \"Bellerophon\" stood out to sea, her guard-boat keeping\r\nat a distance the importunate man with the writ.\r\n\r\nThe whole affair looks very suspicious. What defendant in a plain\r\nstraightforward case would ever have thought of so far-fetched a\r\ndevice as that of getting the ex-Emperor to declare on oath that his\r\nwarships in the West Indies had been unseaworthy? The tempting thought\r\nthat it was a trick of some enterprising journalist in search of \"copy\r\n\"must also be given up as a glaring anachronism. On the other hand,\r\nit is certain that Napoleon's well-wishers in London and Plymouth were\r\nmoving heaven and earth to get him ashore, or delay his\r\ndeparture.[540] In common with Sieyès, Lavalette, and Las Cases, he\r\nhad hoped much from the peculiarities of English law; and on July 28th\r\nhe dictated to Las Cases a paper, \"suited to serve as a basis to\r\njurists,\" which the latter says he managed to send ashore.[541] If\r\nthis be true, Napoleon himself may have spurred on his friends to the\r\neffort just described. Or else the plan may have occurred to some of\r\nhis English admirers who wished to embarrass the Ministry. If so,\r\ntheir attempt met with the fate that usually befalls the efforts of\r\nour anti-national cliques on behalf of their foreign heroes: it did\r\nthem harm: the authorities acted more promptly than they would\r\notherwise have done: the \"Bellerophon\" put to sea a few days before\r\nthe Frenchmen expected, with the result that they were exposed to a\r\ndisagreeable cruise until the \"Northumberland\" (the ship destined for\r\nthe voyage in place of the glorious old \"Bellerophon\") was ready to\r\nreceive them on board.[542]\r\n\r\nDropping down from Portsmouth, the newer ship met the \"Bellerophon\"\r\nand \"Tonnant,\" Lord Keith's ship, off the Start. The transhipment took\r\nplace on the 7th, under the lee of Berry Head, Torbay. After dictating\r\na solemn protest against the compulsion put upon him, the ex-Emperor\r\nthanked Maitland for his honourable conduct, spoke of his having hoped\r\nto buy a small estate in England where he might end his days in peace,\r\nand declaimed bitterly against the Government.\r\n\r\nRear-Admiral Sir George Cockburn, of the \"Northumberland,\" then came\r\nby official order to search his baggage and that of his suite, so as\r\nto withdraw any large sums of money that might be thereafter used for\r\neffecting an escape. Savary and Marchand were present while this was\r\ndone by Cockburn's secretary with as much delicacy as possible: 4,000\r\ngold Napoleons (80,000 francs) were detained to provide a fund for\r\npart maintenance of the illustrious exile. The diamond necklace which\r\nHortense had handed to him at Malmaison was at that time concealed on\r\nLas Cases, who continued to keep it as a sacred trust. The\r\nex-Emperor's attendants were required to give up their swords during\r\nthe voyage. Montholon states that when the same request was made by\r\nKeith to Napoleon, the only reply was a flash of anger from his eyes,\r\nunder which the Admiral's tall figure shrank away, and his head, white\r\nwith years, fell on his breast. Alas, for the attempt at melodrama!\r\n_Maitland was expressly told by Lord Keith not to proffer any such\r\nrequest to the fallen chief_.\r\n\r\nApart from one or two exclamations that he would commit suicide rather\r\nthan go to St. Helena, Napoleon had behaved with a calm and serenity\r\nthat contrasted with the peevish gloom of his officers and the spasms\r\nof Mme. Bertrand. This unhappy lady, on learning their fate, raved in\r\nturn against Maitland, Gourgaud, Napoleon, and against her husband for\r\naccompanying him, and ended by trying to throw herself from a window.\r\nFrom this she was pulled back, whereupon she calmed down and secretly\r\nurged Maitland to write to Lord Keith to prevent Bertrand accompanying\r\nhis master. The captain did so, but of course the Admiral declined to\r\ninterfere. Her shrill complaints against Napoleon had, however, been\r\nheard on the other side of the thin partition, and fanned the dislike\r\nwhich Montholon and Gourgaud had conceived for her, and in part for\r\nher husband. These were the officers whom he selected as companions of\r\nexile. Las Cases was to go as secretary, and his son as page.\r\n\r\nSavary, Lallemand, and Planat having been proscribed by Louis XVIII.,\r\nwere detained by our Government, and subsequently interned at Malta.\r\nOn taking leave of Napoleon they showed deep emotion, while he\r\nbestowed the farewell embrace with remarkable composure. The surgeon,\r\nMaingaud, now declined to proceed to St. Helena, alleging that he had\r\nwanted to go to America only because his uncle there was to leave him\r\na legacy! At the same time Bertrand asked that O'Meara, the surgeon of\r\nthe \"Bellerophon,\" might accompany Napoleon to St. Helena. As\r\nMaingaud's excuse was very lame, and O'Meara had had one or two talks\r\nwith Napoleon _in Italian_, Keith and Maitland should have seen that\r\nthere was some understanding between them; but the Admiral consented\r\nto the proposed change. As to O'Meara's duplicity, we may quote from\r\nBasil Jackson's \"Waterloo and St. Helena\": \"I _know_ that he [O'Meara]\r\nwas _fully enlisted_ for Napoleon's service during the voyage from\r\nRochefort to England.\" The sequel will show how disastrous it was to\r\nallow this man to go with the ex-Emperor.\r\n\r\nIn the Admiral's barge that took him to the \"Northumberland\" the\r\nex-Emperor \"appeared to be in perfect good humour,\" says Keith,\r\n\"talking of Egypt, St. Helena, of my former name being Elphinstone,\r\nand many other subjects, and joking with the ladies about being\r\nseasick.\"[543] In this firm matter-of-fact way did Napoleon accept the\r\nextraordinary change in his fortunes. At no time of his life, perhaps,\r\nwas he so great as when, forgetting his own headlong fall, he sought\r\nto dispel the smaller griefs of Mmes. Bertrand and Montholon. A hush\r\ncame over the crew as Napoleon mounted the side and set foot on the\r\ndeck of the ship that was to bear him away to a life of exile. It was\r\na sight that none could behold unmoved, as the great man uncovered,\r\nreceived the salute, and said with a firm voice: \"Here I am, General,\r\nat your orders.\"\r\n\r\nThe scene was rich, not only in personal interest and pathos, but also\r\nin historic import. It marks the end of a cataclysmic epoch and the\r\ndawn of a dreary and confused age. We may picture the Muse of History,\r\ndrawn distractedly from her abodes on the banks of the Seine, gazing\r\nin wonder on that event taking place under the lee of Berry Head, her\r\nthoughts flashing back, perchance, to the days when William of Orange\r\nbrought his fleet to shore at that same spot and baffled the designs\r\nof the other great ruler of France. The glory of that land is now once\r\nmore to be shrouded in gloom. For a time, like an uneasy ghost, Clio\r\nwill hover above the scenes of Napoleon's exploits and will find\r\nlittle to record but promises broken and development arrested by his\r\nunteachable successors.\r\n\r\nBut the march of Humanity is only clogged: it is not stayed. Ere long\r\nit breaks away into untrodden paths amidst the busy hives of industry\r\nor in the track of the colonizing peoples. The Muse follows in\r\nperplexity: her course at first seems dull and purposeless: her story,\r\nwhen it bids farewell to Napoleon, suffers a bewildering fall in\r\ndramatic interest: but at length new and varied fields open out to\r\nview. Democracy, embattled for seven sad years by Napoleon against her\r\nsister, Nationality, little by little awakens to a consciousness of\r\nthe mistake that has blighted his fortune and hers, and begins to ally\r\nherself with the ill-used champion of the Kings. Industry, starved by\r\nWar, regains her strength and goes forth on a career of conquest more\r\nenduring than that of the great warrior. And the peoples that come to\r\nthe front are not those of the Latin race, whom his wars have stunted,\r\nbut those of the untamable Teutonic stock, the lords of the sea and\r\nthe leaders of Central Europe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the ex-Emperor henceforth differed widely from that\r\nwhich had been hastily arranged by the Czar for his sojourn at Elba.\r\nIn that case he retained the title of Emperor; he reigned over the\r\nisland, and was free to undertake coasting trips. As these generous\r\narrangements had entailed on Europe the loss of more than 80,000 men\r\nin killed and wounded, it is not surprising that the British Ministers\r\nshould now have insisted on far stricter rules, especially as they and\r\ntheir Commissioner had been branded as accomplices in the former\r\nescape. His comfort and dignity were now subordinated to security. As\r\nthe title of Emperor would enable him to claim privileges incompatible\r\nwith any measure of surveillance, it was firmly and consistently\r\ndenied to him; while he as persistently claimed it, and doubtless for\r\nthe same reason. He was now to rank as a General not on active\r\nservice; and Cockburn received orders, while treating him with\r\ndeference and assigning to him the place of honour at table, to\r\nabstain from any acknowledgment of the imperial dignity. Napoleon soon\r\nput this question to the test by rising from dinner before the others\r\nhad finished; but, with the exception of his suite, the others did not\r\naccompany him on deck. At this he was much piqued, as also at seeing\r\nthat the officers did not uncover in his presence on the quarter-deck;\r\nbut when Cockburn's behaviour in this respect was found to be quietly\r\nconsistent, the anger of the exiles began to wear off--or rather it\r\nwas thrust down.\r\n\r\nOne could wish that the conduct of our Government in this matter had\r\nbeen more chivalrous. It is true that we had only on two occasions\r\nacknowledged the imperial title, namely during the negotiations of\r\n1806 and 1814; and to recognize it after his public outlawry would\r\nhave been rather illogical, besides feeding the Bonapartists with\r\nhopes which, in the interests of France, it was well absolutely to\r\nclose. Ministers might also urge that he himself had offered to live\r\nin England _as a private individual_, and that his transference to St.\r\nHelena, which allowed of greater personal liberty than could be\r\naccorded in England, did not alter the essential character of his\r\ndetention. Nevertheless, their decision is to be regretted. The zeal\r\nof his partisans, far from being quenched, was inflamed by what they\r\nconceived to be a gratuitous insult; and these feelings, artfully\r\nworked upon by tales, medals, and pictures of the modern Prometheus\r\nchained to the rock, had no small share in promoting unrest in France.\r\n\r\nApart from this initial friction, Napoleon's relations to the Admiral\r\nand officers were fairly cordial. He chatted with him at the\r\ndinner-table and during the hour's walk that they afterwards usually\r\ntook on the quarter-deck. His conversations showed no signs of despair\r\nor mental lethargy. They ranged over a great variety of topics,\r\ngeneral and personal. He discussed details of navigation and\r\nshipbuilding with a minuteness of knowledge that surprised the men of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nFrom his political conversations with Cockburn we may cull the\r\nfollowing remarks. He said that he really meant to invade England in\r\n1803-5, and to dictate terms of peace at London. He stoutly defended\r\nhis execution of the Duc d'Enghien, and named none of the paltry\r\nexcuses that his admirers were later on to discover for that crime.\r\nReferring to recent events, he inveighed against the French Liberals,\r\ndeclared that he had humoured the Chambers far too much, and dilated\r\non the danger of representative institutions on the Continent. However\r\nmuch a Parliament might suit England, it was, he declared, highly\r\nperilous in Continental States. With respect to the future of France,\r\nhe expressed the conviction that, as soon as the armies of occupation\r\nwere withdrawn, there would be a general insurrection owing to the\r\nstrong military bias of the people and their hatred of the Bourbons,\r\nnow again brought back by devastating hordes of foreigners.[544]\r\n\r\nThis last observation probably explains the general buoyancy of his\r\nbearing. He did not consider the present settlement as final; and\r\ndoubtless it was his boundless fund of hope that enabled him to\r\ntriumph over the discomforts of the present, which left his companions\r\nmorose and snappish. \"His spirits are even,\" wrote Glover, the\r\nAdmiral's secretary, at the equator, \"and he appears perfectly\r\nunconcerned about his fate.\"[545] His recreations were chess, which he\r\nplayed with more vehemence than skill, and games of hazard, especially\r\n_vingt-et-un_: he began to learn \"le wisth\" from our officers.\r\nSometimes he and Gourgaud amused themselves by extracting the square\r\nand cube roots of numbers; he also began to learn English from Las\r\nCases. On some occasions he diverted his male companions with tales of\r\nhis adventures, both military and amorous. His interest in the ship\r\nand in the events of the voyage did not flag. When a shark was caught\r\nand hauled up, \"Bonaparte with the eagerness of a schoolboy scrambled\r\non the poop to see it.\"\r\n\r\nHis health continued excellent. Despite his avoidance of vegetables\r\nand an excessive consumption of meat, he suffered little from\r\nindigestion, except during a few days of fierce sirocco wind off\r\nMadeira. He breakfasted about 10 on meat and wine, and remained in his\r\ncabin reading, dictating, or learning English, until about 3 p.m.,\r\nwhen he played games and took exercise preparatory to dinner at 5.\r\nAfter a full meal, in which he partook by preference of the most\r\nhighly dressed dishes of meat, he walked the deck for an hour or more.\r\nOn one evening, the Admiral begged to be excused owing to a heavy\r\nequatorial rain-storm; but the ex-Emperor went up as usual, saying\r\nthat the rain would not hurt him any more than the sailors; and it did\r\nnot. The incident claims some notice: for it proves that, whatever\r\nlater writers may say as to his decline of vitality in 1815, he\r\nhimself was unaware of it, and braved with impunity a risk that a\r\nvigorous naval officer preferred to avoid. Moreover, the mere fact\r\nthat he was able to keep up a heavy meat diet all through the tropics\r\nbespeaks a constitution of exceptional strength, unimpaired as yet by\r\nthe internal malady which was to be his doom.\r\n\r\nThat one element of conviviality was not wanting at meals will appear\r\nfrom the official return of the consumption of wine at the Admiral's\r\ntable by his seven French guests and six British officers: Port, 20\r\ndozen; Claret, 45 dozen; Madeira, 22 dozen; Champagne, 13 dozen;\r\nSherry, 7 dozen; Malmsey, 5 dozen.[546] The \"Peruvian\" had been\r\ndetached from the squadron to Guernsey to lay in a stock of French\r\nwines specially for the exiles; and 15 dozen of claret--Napoleon's\r\nfavourite beverage--were afterwards sent on shore at St. Helena for\r\nhis use.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the evenness of his health, which surprised Cockburn,\r\nWarden, and O'Meara alike, was largely due to his iron will. He knew\r\nthat his exile must be disagreeable, but he had that useful faculty of\r\nencasing himself in the present, which dulls the edge of care.\r\nBesides, his tastes were not so exacting, or his temperament so\r\nvolatile, as to shroud him in the gloom that besets weaker natures in\r\ntime of trouble. Alas for him, it was far otherwise with his\r\ncompanions. The impressionable young Gourgaud, the thought-wrinkled\r\nLas Cases, the bright pleasure-loving Montholons, the gloomy Grand\r\nMarshal, Bertrand, and his mercurial consort, over whose face there\r\noften passed \"a gleam of distraction\"--these were not fashioned for a\r\nlife of adversity. Thence came the long spells of _ennui_, broken by\r\nflashes of temper, that marked the voyage and the sojourn at St.\r\nHelena.\r\n\r\nThe storm-centre was generally Mme. Bertrand; her varying moods, that\r\nproclaimed her Irish-Creole parentage, early brought on her the\r\nhostility of the others, including Napoleon; and as the discovery of\r\nher little plot to prevent Bertrand going to St. Helena gave them a\r\nconvenient weapon, the voyage was for her one long struggle against\r\ncovert intrigues, thinly veiled sarcasms, sea-sickness, and despair.\r\nAt last she has to keep to her cabin, owing to some nervous disorder.\r\nOn hearing of this Napoleon remarks that it is better she should\r\ndie--such is Gourgaud's report of his words. Unfortunately, she\r\nrecovers: after ten days she reappears, receives the congratulations\r\nof the officers in the large cabin where Napoleon is playing chess\r\nwith Montholon. He receives her with a stolid stare and goes on with\r\nthe game. After a time the Admiral hands her to her seat at the\r\ndinner-table, on the ex-Emperor's left. Still no recognition from her\r\nchief! But the claret bottle that should be in front of him is not\r\nthere: she reaches over and hands it to him. Then come the looked-for\r\nwords: \"Ah! comment se porte madame?\"--That is all.[547]\r\n\r\nFor Bertrand, even in his less amiable moods, Bonaparte ever had the\r\nfriendly word that feeds the well-spring of devotion. On the\r\n\"Bellerophon,\" when they hotly differed on a trivial subject, Bertrand\r\ntestily replied to his dogmatic statements: \"Oh! if you reply in that\r\nmanner, there is an end of all argument.\" Far from taking offence at\r\nthis retort, Napoleon soothed him and speedily restored him to good\r\ntemper--a good instance of his forbearance to those whom he really\r\nadmired.\r\n\r\nCertainly the exiles were not happy among themselves. Even the amiable\r\nMme. Montholon was the cause of one quarrel at table. After leaving\r\nFunchal, Cockburn states that a Roman Catholic priest there has\r\noffered to accompany the ex-Emperor. Napoleon replies in a way that\r\nproves his utter indifference; but the ladies launch out on the\r\nsubject of religion. The discussion waxes hot, until the impetuous\r\nGourgaud shoots out the remark that Montholon is wanting in respect\r\nfor his wife. Whereupon the Admiral ends the scene by rising from\r\ntable. Sir George Bingham, Colonel of the 53rd Regiment sailing in the\r\nsquadron, passes the comment in his diary: \"It is not difficult to see\r\nthat envy, hatred, and all uncharitableness are firmly rooted in\r\nNapoleon's family, and that their residence in St. Helena will be\r\nrendered very uncomfortable by it.\"[548]\r\n\r\nIntrigues there are of kaleidoscopic complexity, either against the\r\nsuperior Bertrands or the rising influence of Las Cases. This official\r\nhas but yesterday edged his way into the Emperor's inner circle, and\r\nGourgaud frankly reminds him of the fact: \"'If I have come [with the\r\nEmperor] it is because I have followed him for four years, except at\r\nElba. I have saved his life; and one loves those whom one has\r\nobliged.... But you, sir, he did not know you even by sight: then, why\r\nthis great devotion of yours?'--I see around me,\" he continues, \"many\r\nintrigues and deceptions. Poor Gourgaud, _qu'allais-tu faire dans\r\ncette galère_?\"[549]\r\n\r\nThe young aide-de-camp's influence is not allowed to wane for lack of\r\nself-advertisement. Thus, when the battle of Waterloo is mentioned at\r\ntable, he at once gives his version of it, and stoutly maintains that,\r\n_whatever Napoleon may say to the contrary_, he (Napoleon) did mistake\r\nthe Prussian army for Grouchy's force: and, waxing eloquent on this\r\ntheme, he exclaims to his neighbour, Glover, \"that at one time he\r\n[Gourgaud] might have taken the Duke of Wellington prisoner, but he\r\n_desisted from it, knowing the effusion of blood it would have\r\noccasioned_.\"[550]--It is charitable to assume that this utterance was\r\ninspired by some liquid stronger than the alleged \"stale water that\r\nhad been to India and back.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole, was there ever an odder company of shipmates since the\r\ndays of Noah? A cheery solid Admiral, a shadowy Captain Ross who can\r\nnavigate but does not open his lips, a talkative creature of the\r\nsecretary type, the soldierly Bingham, the graceful courtly\r\nMontholons, the young General who out-gascons the Gascons, the\r\nwire-drawn subtle Las Cases, the melancholy Grand Marshal and his\r\nspasmodic consort--all of them there to guard or cheer that pathetic\r\ncentral figure, the world's conqueror and world's exile.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile France was feeling the results of his recent enterprise.\r\nEnormous armies began to hold her down until the Bourbons, whose\r\nnullity was a pledge for peace, should be firmly re-established.\r\nBlücher, baulked of his wish to shoot Bonaparte, was with difficulty\r\ndissuaded by the protests of Wellington and Louis XVIII. from blowing\r\nup the Pont de Jéna at Paris; and the fierce veteran voiced the\r\ngeneral opinion of Germans, including Metternich, that France must be\r\npartitioned, or at least give back Alsace and Lorraine to the\r\nFatherland. Even Lord Liverpool, our cautious Premier, wrote on July\r\n15th that, if Bonaparte remained at large, the allies ought to retain\r\nall the northern fortresses as a security.[551] But the knowledge that\r\nthe warrior was in our power led our statesmen to bear less hardly on\r\nFrance. From the outset Wellington sought to bring the allies to\r\nreason, and on August 11th he wrote a despatch that deserves to rank\r\namong his highest titles to fame. While granting that France was still\r\nleft \"in too great strength for the rest of Europe,\" he pointed out\r\nthat \"revolutionary France is more likely to distress the world, than\r\nFrance, however strong in her frontier, under a regular Government;\r\nand that is the situation in which we ought to endeavour to place\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nThis generous and statesmanlike judgment, consorting with that of the\r\nCzar, prevailed over the German policy of partition; and it was\r\nfinally arranged by the Treaty of Paris of November 20th, 1815, that\r\nFrance should surrender only the frontier strips around Marienburg,\r\nSaarbrücken, Landau, and Chambéry, also paying war indemnities and\r\nrestoring to their lawful owners all the works of art of which\r\nNapoleon had rifled the chief cities of the continent. In one respect\r\nthese terms were extraordinarily lenient. Great Britain, after bearing\r\nthe chief financial strain of the war, might have claimed some of the\r\nFrench colonies which she restored in 1814, or at least have required\r\nthe surrender of the French claims on part of the Newfoundland coast.\r\nEven this last was not done, and alone of the States that had suffered\r\nloss of valuable lives, we exacted no territorial indemnity for the\r\nwar of 1815.[552] In truth, our Ministers were content with placing\r\nFrance and her ancient dynasty in an honourable position, in the hope\r\nthat Europe would thus at last find peace; and the forty years of\r\nalmost unbroken rest that followed justified their magnanimity.\r\n\r\nBut there was one condition fundamental to the Treaty of Paris and\r\nessential to the peace of Europe, namely, that Napoleon should be\r\nsecurely guarded at St. Helena.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nCLOSING YEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a voyage of sixty-seven days the exiles sighted St.\r\nHelena--\"that black wart rising out of the ocean,\" as Surgeon Henry\r\ncalls it. Blank dismay laid hold of the more sensitive as they gazed\r\nat those frowning cliffs. What Napoleon's feelings were we know not.\r\nWatchful curiosity seemed to be uppermost; for as they drew near to\r\nJamestown, he minutely scanned the forts through a glass. Arrangements\r\nhaving been made for his reception, he landed in the evening of the\r\n17th October, so as to elude the gaze of the inhabitants, and entered\r\na house prepared for him in the town.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow he was up at dawn, and rode with Cockburn and Bertrand\r\nto Longwood, the residence of the Lieutenant-Governor. The orders of\r\nour East India Company, to which the island then belonged, forbade his\r\nappropriation of Plantation House, the Governor's residence; and a\r\nglance at the accompanying map will show the reason of this\r\nprohibition. This house is situated not far from creeks that are\r\ncompletely sheltered from the south-east trade winds, whence escape by\r\nboat would be easy; whereas Longwood is nearer the surf-beaten side\r\nand offers far more security. After conferring with Governor Wilks and\r\nothers, Cockburn decided on this residence.\r\n\r\n    \"At Longwood,\" wrote Cockburn, \"an extent of level ground, easily\r\n    to be secured by sentries, presents itself, perfectly adapted for\r\n    horse exercise, carriage exercise, or for pleasant walking, which\r\n    is not to be met with in all the other parts of the island. The\r\n    house is certainly small; but ... I trust the carpenters of the\r\n    'Northumberland' will in a little time be able to make such\r\n    additions to the house as will render it, if not as good as might\r\n    be wished, yet at least as commodious as necessary.\"[553]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. HELENA]\r\n\r\n\"Napoleon,\" wrote Glover, \"seemed well satisfied with the situation of\r\nLongwood, and expressed a desire to occupy it as soon as possible.\" As\r\nhe disliked the publicity of the house in Jamestown, Cockburn\r\nsuggested on their return that he should reside at a pretty little\r\nbungalow, not far from the town, named \"The Briars.\" He readily\r\nassented, and took up his abode there for seven weeks, occupying a\r\nsmall adjoining annexe, while Las Cases and his son established\r\nthemselves in the two garrets. A marquee was erected to serve as\r\ndining-room. It was a narrow space for the lord of the Tuileries, but\r\nhe seems to have been not unhappy. There he dictated Memoranda to Las\r\nCases or Gourgaud in the mornings, and often joined the neighbouring\r\nfamily of the Balcombes for dinner and the evening. Mr. Balcombe, an\r\nelderly merchant, was appointed purveyor to the party; he and his wife\r\nwere most hospitable, and their two daughters, of fifteen and fourteen\r\nyears, frequently beguiled Napoleon's evening hours with games of\r\nwhist or naïve questions. On one supreme occasion, in order to please\r\nthe younger girl, Napoleon played at blindman's buff; at such times\r\nshe ventured to call him \"Boney\"; and, far from taking offence at this\r\nliberty, he delighted in her glee. It is such episodes as these that\r\nreveal the softer traits of his character, which the dictates of\r\npolicy had stunted but not eradicated.[554]\r\n\r\nIn other respects, the time at \"The Briars\" was dull and monotonous,\r\nand he complained bitterly to Cockburn of the inadequate\r\naccommodation. The most exciting times were on the arrival of\r\nnewspapers from Europe. The reports just to hand of riots in England\r\nand royalist excesses in France fed his hopes of general disorders or\r\nrevolutions which might lead to his recall. He believed the Jacobins\r\nwould yet lord it over the Continent. \"It is only I who can tame\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nEqually noteworthy are his comments on the trials of Labédoyère and\r\nNey for their treason to Louis XVIII. He has little pity for them.\r\n\"One ought never to break one's word,\" he remarked to Gourgaud, \"and I\r\ndespise traitors.\" On hearing that Labédoyère was condemned to death,\r\nhe at first shows more feeling: but he comes round to the former view:\r\n\"Labédoyère acted like a man without honour,\" and \"Ney dishonoured\r\nhimself.\"[555]\r\n\r\nWe may hereby gauge the value which Napoleon laid on fidelity. For him\r\nit is the one priceless virtue. He esteems those who staunchly oppose\r\nhim, and seeks to gain them over by generosity: for those who _come\r\nover_ he ever has a secret contempt; for those who desert him, hatred.\r\nDoubtless that is why he heard the news of Ney's execution unmoved.\r\nBrilliantly brave as the Marshal was, he had abandoned him in 1814,\r\nand Louis XVIII. in the Hundred Days. The tidings of Murat's miserable\r\nfate, at the close of his mad expedition to Calabria, leave Napoleon\r\nequally cold.--\"I announce the fatal news,\" writes Gourgaud, \"to His\r\nMajesty, whose expression remains unchanged, and who says that Murat\r\nmust have been mad to attempt a venture like that.\"--Here again his\r\nthoughts seem to fly back to Murat's defection in 1814. Later on, he\r\nsays he loved him for his brilliant bravery, and therefore pardoned\r\nhis numerous follies. But his present demeanour shows that he never\r\nforgave that of 1814.[556]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, thanks to the energy of Cockburn and his sailors, Longwood\r\nwas ready for the party (December 9th, 1815), and the Admiral hoped\r\nthat their complaints would cease. The new abode contained five rooms\r\nfor Napoleon's use, three for the Montholons, two for the Las Cases,\r\nand one for Gourgaud: it was situated on a plateau 1,730 feet above\r\nthe sea: the air there was bracing, and on the farther side of the\r\nplain dotted with gum trees stretched the race-course, a mile and a\r\nhalf of excellent turf. The only obvious drawbacks were the occasional\r\nmists, and the barren precipitous ravines that flank the plateau on\r\nall sides. Seeing, however, that Napoleon disliked the publicity of\r\nJamestown, the isolation of Longwood could hardly be alleged as a\r\nserious grievance. The Bertrands occupied Hutt's Gate, a small villa\r\nabout a mile distant.\r\n\r\nThe limits within which Napoleon might take exercise unaccompanied by\r\na British officer formed a roughly triangular space having a\r\ncircumference of about twelve miles. Outside of those bounds he must\r\nbe so accompanied; and if a strange ship came in sight, he was to\r\nreturn within bounds. The letters of the whole party must be\r\nsupervised by the acting Governor. This is the gist of the official\r\ninstructions. Napoleon's dislike of being accompanied by a British\r\nofficer led him nearly always to restrict himself to the limits and\r\ngenerally to the grounds of Longwood.\r\n\r\nAnd where, we may ask, could a less unpleasant place of detention have\r\nbeen found? In Europe he must inevitably have submitted to far closer\r\nconfinement. For what safeguards could there have been proof against a\r\nsubtle intellect and a personality whose charm fired thousands of\r\nbraves in both hemispheres with the longing to start him once more on\r\nhis adventures? The Tower of London, the eyrie of Dumbarton Castle,\r\neven Fort William itself, were named as possible places of detention.\r\nWere they suited to this child of the Mediterranean? He needed sun; he\r\nneeded exercise; he needed society. All these he could have on the\r\nplateau of Longwood, in a singularly equable climate, where the heat\r\nof the tropics is assuaged by the south-east trade wind, and plants of\r\nthe sub-tropical and temperate zones alike flourish.[557]\r\n\r\nBut nothing pleased the exiles. They moped during the rains; they\r\nshuddered at the yawning ravines; they groaned at the sight of the\r\nred-coats; above all, they realized that escape was hopeless in face\r\nof Cockburn's watchful care. His first steps on arriving at the island\r\nwere to send on to the Cape seventy-five foreigners whose presence was\r\nundesirable. He also despatched the \"Peruvian\" to hoist the British\r\nflag on the uninhabited island, Ascension, in order, as he wrote to\r\nthe Admiralty, \"to prevent America or any other nation from planting\r\nthemselves [_sic_] there ... for the purpose of favouring sooner or\r\nlater the escape of General Bonaparte.\" Four ships of war were also\r\nkept at St. Helena, and no merchantmen but those of the East India\r\nCompany were to touch there except under stress of weather or when in\r\nneed of water.\r\n\r\nThese precautions early provoked protests from the exiles. Bertrand\r\nhad no wish to draw them up in the trenchant style that the ex-Emperor\r\ndesired; but Gourgaud's \"Journal\" shows that he was driven on to the\r\ntask (November 5th). It only led to a lofty rejoinder from Cockburn,\r\nin which he declined to relax his system, but expressed the wish to\r\nrender their situation \"as little disagreeable as possible.\" On\r\nDecember 21st, Montholon returned to the charge with a letter dictated\r\nby Napoleon, complaining that Longwood was the most barren spot on the\r\nisland, always deluged with rain or swathed in mist; that O'Meara was\r\nnot to count as a British officer when they went beyond the limits,\r\nand had been reprimanded by the Admiral for thus acting; and that the\r\ntreatment of the exiles would excite the indignation of all times and\r\nall people. To this the Admiral sent a crushing rejoinder, declining\r\nto explain why he had censured O'Meara or any other British subject:\r\nhe asserted that Longwood was \"the most pleasant as well as the most\r\nhealthy spot of this most healthful island,\" expressed the hope that,\r\nwhen the rains had ceased, the party would change their opinion of\r\nLongwood, and declared that the treatment of the party would \"obtain\r\nthe admiration of future ages, as well as of every unprejudiced person\r\nof the present.\"\r\n\r\nWe now know that the Admiral's trust in the judicial impartiality of\r\nfuture ages was a piece of touching credulity, and that the next\r\ngeneration, like his own, was greedily to swallow sensational slander\r\nand to neglect the prosaic truth. But, arguing from present signs, he\r\nmight well believe that Montholon's letter was a tissue of falsehoods;\r\nfor that officer soon confessed to him that \"it was written in a\r\nmoment of petulance of the General [Bonaparte] ... and that he\r\n[Montholon] considered the party to be in point of fact vastly well\r\noff and to have everything necessary for them, though anxious that\r\nthere should be no restrictions as to the General going unattended by\r\nan officer wherever he pleased throughout the island.\"[558] On the\r\nlast point Cockburn was inflexible.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral's responsibility was now nearly at an end. On April 14th,\r\n1816, there landed at St. Helena Sir Hudson Lowe, the new Governor,\r\nwho was to take over the powers wielded both by Cockburn and Wilks.\r\nThe new arrival, on whom the storms of calumny were thenceforth\r\npersistently to beat, had served with distinction in many parts. Born\r\nin 1769, within one month of Napoleon, he early entered our army, and\r\nwon his commission by service in Corsica and Elba, his linguistic and\r\nmilitary gifts soon raising him to the command of a corps of Corsican\r\nexiles who after 1795 enlisted in our service. With these \"Corsican\r\nRangers\" Lowe campaigned in Egypt and finally at Capri, their devotion\r\nto him nerving them to a gallant but unavailing defence of this islet\r\nagainst a superior force of Murat's troops in 1808.[559] In 1810 Lowe\r\nand his Corsicans captured the Isle of Santa Maura, which he\r\nthereafter governed to the full satisfaction of the inhabitants. Early\r\nin 1813 he was ordered to Russia, and thereafter served as _attaché_\r\non Blücher's staff in the memorable advance to the Rhine and the\r\nSeine. He brought the news of Napoleon's first abdication to England,\r\nwas knighted by the Prince Regent, and received Russian and Prussian\r\norders of distinction for his services. At the close of 1814 he was\r\nappointed Quartermaster-General of our forces in the Netherlands and\r\nreceived flattering letters of congratulation from Blücher and\r\nGneisenau, the latter expressing his appreciation of \"Your rare\r\nmilitary talents, your profound judgment on the great operations of\r\nwar, and your imperturbable _sang froid_ in the day of battle. These\r\nrare qualities and your honourable character will link me to you\r\neternally.\" In 1822, when O'Meara was slandering Lowe's character, the\r\nCzar Alexander met his step-daughter, the Countess Balmain, at Verona,\r\nand in reference to Sir Hudson's painful duties at St. Helena, said of\r\nhim: \"Je l'estime beaucoup. Je l'ai connu dans les temps\r\ncritiques.\"[560]\r\n\r\nLowe's firmness of character, command of foreign languages, and\r\nintimate acquaintance with Corsicans, seemed to mark him out as the\r\nideal Governor of St. Helena in place of the mild and scholarly Wilks.\r\nAnd yet the appointment was in some ways unfortunate. Though a man of\r\nsterling worth, Lowe was reserved, and had little acquaintance with\r\nthe ways of courtiers. Moreover, the superstitious might deem that all\r\nthe salient events of his career proclaimed him an evil genius dogging\r\nthe steps of Napoleon; and, as superstition laid increasing hold on\r\nthe great Corsican in his later years, we may reasonably infer that\r\nthis feeling intensified, if it did not create, the repugnance which\r\nhe ever manifested to _la figure sinistre_ of the Governor. Lowe also\r\nat first shrank from an appointment that must bring on him the\r\nintrigues of Napoleon and of his partisans in England. Only a man of\r\nhigh rank and commanding influence could hope to live down such\r\nattacks; and Lowe had neither rank nor influence. He was the son of an\r\narmy surgeon, and was almost unknown in the country which for\r\ntwenty-eight years he had served abroad.\r\n\r\nHis first visits to Longwood were unfortunate. Cockburn and he\r\narranged to go at 9 a.m., the time when Napoleon frequently went for a\r\ndrive. On their arrival they were informed that the Emperor was\r\nindisposed and could not see them until 4 p.m. of the next day, and it\r\nsoon appeared that the early hour of their call was taken as an act of\r\nrudeness. On the following afternoon Lowe and Cockburn arranged to go\r\nin together to the presence; but as Lowe advanced to the chamber,\r\nBertrand stepped forward, and a valet prevented the Admiral's\r\nentrance, an act of incivility which Lowe did not observe. Proceeding\r\nalone, the new Governor offered his respects in French; but on\r\nNapoleon remarking that he must know Italian, for he had commanded a\r\nregiment of Corsicans, they conversed in Napoleon's mother-tongue. The\r\nex-Emperor's first serious observation, which bore on the character of\r\nthe Corsicans, was accompanied by a quick searching glance: \"They\r\ncarry the stiletto: are they not a bad people?\"--Lowe saw the snare\r\nand evaded it by the reply: \"They do not carry the stiletto, having\r\nabandoned that custom in our service: I was very well satisfied with\r\nthem.\" They then conversed a short time about Egypt and other topics.\r\nNapoleon afterwards contrasted him favourably with Cockburn: \"This new\r\nGovernor is a man of very few words, but he appears to be a polite\r\nman: however, it is only from a man's conduct for some time that you\r\ncan judge of him.\"[561]\r\n\r\nCockburn was indignant at the slight put upon him by Napoleon and\r\nBertrand, which succeeded owing to Lowe's want of ready perception;\r\nbut he knew that the cause of the exiles' annoyance was his recent\r\nfirm refusal to convey Napoleon's letter of complaint direct to the\r\nPrince Regent, without the knowledge of the Ministry. Failing to bend\r\nthe Admiral, they then sought to cajole the retiring Governor, Wilks,\r\nwho, having borne little of the responsibility of their custody, was\r\nproportionately better liked. First Bertrand, and then Napoleon,\r\nrequested him to take this letter _without the knowledge of the new\r\nGovernor_. Wilks at once repelled the request, remarking to Bertrand\r\nthat such attempts at evasion must lead to greater stringency in the\r\nfuture. And this was the case.[562] The incident naturally increased\r\nLowe's suspicion of the ex-Emperor.\r\n\r\nAt first there was an uneasy truce between them. Gourgaud, though cast\r\ndown at the departure of the \"adorable\" Miss Wilks, found strength\r\nenough to chronicle in his \"Journal\" the results of a visit paid by\r\nLas Cases to Lowe at Plantation House (April 26th): the Governor\r\nreceived the secretary very well and put all his library at the\r\ndisposal of the party; but the diarist also notes that Napoleon took\r\namiss the reception of any of his people by the Governor. This had\r\nbeen one of the unconscious crimes of the Admiral. With the hope of\r\nbrightening the sojourn of the exiles, he had given several balls, at\r\nwhich Mmes. Bertrand and Montholon shone resplendent in dresses that\r\ncast into the shade those of the officers' wives. Their triumph was\r\nshort-lived. When _la grande Maréchale_ ventured to desert the\r\nEmperor's table on these and other festive occasions, her growing\r\nfondness for the English drew on her sharp rebukes from the ex-Emperor\r\nand a request not to treat Longwood as if it were an inn.[563] Many\r\njottings in Gourgaud's diary show that the same policy was thenceforth\r\nstrictly maintained. Napoleon kept up the essentials of Tuileries\r\netiquette, required the attendance of his courtiers, and jealously\r\nchecked any familiarity with Plantation House or Jamestown.\r\n\r\nOn some questions Lowe was more pliable than the home Government,\r\nnotably in the matter of the declarations signed by Napoleon's\r\nfollowers. But in one matter he was proof against all requests from\r\nLongwood: this was the extension of the twelve-mile limit. It\r\nafterwards became the custom to speak as if Lowe could have granted\r\nthis. Even the Duke of Wellington declared to Stanhope that he\r\nconsidered Lowe a stupid man, suspicious and jealous, who might very\r\nwell have let Napoleon go freely about the island provided that the\r\nsix or seven landing-places were well guarded and that Napoleon showed\r\nhimself to a British officer every night and morning. Now, it is\r\nfutile to discuss whether such liberty would have enabled Napoleon to\r\npass off as someone else and so escape. What is certain is that our\r\nGovernment, believing he could so escape, _imposed rules which Lowe\r\nwas not free to relax_.\r\n\r\nNapoleon realized this perfectly well, but in the interview of April\r\n30th, 1816, he pressed Lowe for an extension of the limits, saying\r\nthat he hated the sight of our soldiers and longed for closer\r\nintercourse with the inhabitants. Other causes of friction occurred,\r\nsuch as Lowe's withdrawal of the privilege, rather laxly granted by\r\nCockburn to Bertrand, of granting passes for interviews with Napoleon;\r\nor again a tactless invitation that Lowe sent to \"General Bonaparte\"\r\nto meet the wife of the Governor-General of India at dinner at\r\nPlantation House. But in the midst of the diatribe which Napoleon\r\nshortly afterwards shot forth at his would-be host--a diatribe\r\nbesprinkled with taunts that Lowe was sent to be his\r\n_executioner_--there came a sentence which reveals the cause of his\r\nfury: \"If you cannot extend my limits, you can do nothing for\r\nme.\"[564]\r\n\r\nWhy this wish for wider limits? It did not spring from a desire for\r\nlonger drives; for the plateau offered nearly all the best ground in\r\nthe island for such exercise. Neither was it due to a craving for\r\nwider social intercourse. There can be little doubt that he looked on\r\nan extension of limits as a necessary prelude to attempts at escape\r\nand as a means of influencing the slaves at the outlying plantations.\r\nGourgaud names several instances of gold pieces being given to slaves,\r\nand records the glee shown by his master on once slipping away from\r\nthe sentries and the British officer. These feelings and attempts were\r\nperfectly natural on Napoleon's part; but it was equally natural that\r\nthe Governor should regard them as part of a plan of escape or\r\nrescue--a matter that will engage our closer attention presently.\r\n\r\nNapoleon had only two more interviews with Lowe namely, on July 17th\r\nand August 18th. In the former of these he was more conciliatory; but\r\nin the latter, at which Admiral Sir Pulteney Malcolm was present, he\r\nassailed the Governor with the bitterest taunts. Lowe cut short the\r\npainful scene by saying: \"You make me smile, sir.\" \"How smile, sir?\"\r\n\"You force me to smile: your misconception of my character and the\r\nrudeness of your manners excite my pity. I wish you good day.\" The\r\nAdmiral also retired.[565]\r\n\r\nVarious causes have been assigned for the hatred that Napoleon felt\r\nfor Lowe. His frequents taunts that he was no general, but only a\r\nleader of Corsican deserters, suggests one that has already been\r\nreferred to. It has also been suggested that Lowe was not a gentleman,\r\nand references have been approvingly made to comparisons of his\r\nphysiognomy with that of the devil, and of his eye with \"that of a\r\nhyæna caught in a trap.\" As to this we will cite the opinion of\r\nLieutenant (later Colonel) Basil Jackson, who was unknown to Lowe\r\nbefore 1816, and was on friendly terms with the inmates both of\r\nLongwood and of Plantation House:\r\n\r\n    \"He [Lowe] stood five feet seven, spare in make, having good\r\n    features, fair hair, and eyebrows overhanging his eyes: his look\r\n    denoted penetration and firmness, his manner rather abrupt, his\r\n    gait quick, his look and general demeanour indicative of energy\r\n    and decision. He wrote or dictated rapidly, and was fond of\r\n    writing, was well read in military history, spoke French and\r\n    Italian with fluency, was warm and steady in his friendships, and\r\n    popular both with the inhabitants of the isle and the troops. His\r\n    portrait, prefixed to Mr. Forsyth's book, is a perfect\r\n    likeness.\"[566]\r\n\r\nIf overhanging eyebrows, a penetrating glance, and rather abrupt\r\nmanners be thought to justify comparisons with the devil or a hyæna,\r\nthe art of historical portraiture will assuredly have to be learnt\r\nover again in conformity with impressionist methods. That Lowe was a\r\ngentleman is affirmed by Mrs. Smith (_née_ Grant), who, in later\r\nyears, _when prejudiced against him by O'Meara's slanders_, met him at\r\nColombo without at first knowing his name:\r\n\r\n    \"I was taken in to dinner by a grave, particularly gentlemanly\r\n    man, in a General's uniform, whose conversation was as agreeable\r\n    as his manner. He had been over half the world, knew all\r\n    celebrities, and contrived without display to say a great deal one\r\n    was willing to hear.... Years before, with our Whig principles and\r\n    prejudices, we had cultivated in our Highland retirement a horror\r\n    of the great Napoleon's gaoler. The cry of party, the feeling for\r\n    the prisoner, the book of Surgeon O'Meara, had all worked my\r\n    woman's heart to such a pitch of indignation that this maligned\r\n    name [Lowe] was an offence. We were to hold the owner in\r\n    abhorrence. Speak to him, never! Look at him, sit in the same room\r\n    with him, never! None were louder than I, more vehement; yet here\r\n    was I beside my bugbear and perfectly satisfied with my position.\r\n    It was a good lesson.\"[567]\r\n\r\nThe real cause of Napoleon's hatred of Lowe is hinted at by Sir George\r\nBingham in his Diary (April 19th). After mentioning Napoleon's\r\nrudeness to Cockburn on parting with him, he proceeds:\r\n\r\n    \"You have no idea of the dirty little intrigues of himself\r\n    [Napoleon] and his set: if Sir H. Lowe has firmness enough not to\r\n    give way to them, he will in a short time treat him in the same\r\n    manner. For myself, it is said I am a favourite [of Napoleon],\r\n    though I do not understand the claim I have to such.\"[568]\r\n\r\n\r\nYes! Lowe's offence lay not in his manners, not even in his features,\r\nbut in his firmness. Napoleon soon saw that all his efforts to bend\r\nhim were in vain. Neither in regard to the Imperial title, nor the\r\nlimits, nor the transmission of letters to Europe, would the Governor\r\nswerve a hair's breadth from his instructions. At the risk of giving a\r\nsurfeit of quotations, we must cite two more on this topic. Basil\r\nJackson, when at Paris in 1828, chanced to meet Montholon, and was\r\ninvited to his Château de Frémigny; during his stay the conversation\r\nturned upon their sojourn at St. Helena, to the following effect:\r\n\r\n    \"He [Montholon] enlarged upon what he termed _la politique de\r\n    Longwood_, spoke not unkindly of Sir Hudson Lowe, allowing he had\r\n    a difficult task to execute, since an angel from Heaven, as\r\n    Governor, could not have pleased them. When I more than hinted\r\n    that nothing could justify detraction and departure from truth in\r\n    carrying out a policy, he merely shrugged his shoulders and\r\n    reiterated: '_C'était notre politique; et que voulez-vous?_' That\r\n    he and the others respected Sir Hudson Lowe, I had not the shadow\r\n    of a doubt: nay, in a conversation with Montholon at St. Helena,\r\n    when speaking of the Governor, he observed that Sir Hudson was an\r\n    officer who would always have distinguished employment, as all\r\n    Governments were glad of the services of a man of his calibre.\r\n\r\n    \"Happening to mention that, owing to his inability to find an\r\n    officer who could understand and speak French, the Governor was\r\n    disposed to employ me as orderly officer at Longwood, Montholon\r\n    said it was well for me that I was not appointed to the post, as\r\n    they did not want a person in that capacity who could understand\r\n    them; in fact, he said, we should have found means to get rid of\r\n    you, and perhaps ruined you.\"[569]\r\n\r\n\r\nLas Cases also, _in a passage that he found it desirable to suppress\r\nwhen he published his \"Journal\"_ wrote as follows (November 30th,\r\n1815):\r\n\r\n    \"We are possessed of moral arms only: and in order to make the\r\n    most advantageous use of these it was necessary to reduce into _a\r\n    system_ our demeanour, our words, our sentiments, _even our\r\n    privations_, in order that we might thereby excite a lively\r\n    interest in a large portion of the population of Europe, and that\r\n    the Opposition in England might not fail to attack the Ministry on\r\n    the violence of their conduct towards us.\"[570]\r\n\r\nWe are now able to understand the real nature of the struggle that\r\nwent on between Longwood and Plantation House. Napoleon and his\r\nfollowers sought by every means to bring odium upon Lowe, and to\r\nfurnish the Opposition at Westminster with toothsome details that\r\nmight lead to the disgrace of the Governor, the overthrow of the\r\nMinistry, and the triumphant release of the ex-Emperor. On the other\r\nhand, the knowledge of the presence of traitors on the island, and of\r\npossible rescuers hovering about on the horizon, kept Lowe ever at\r\nwork \"unravelling the intricate plotting constantly going on at\r\nLongwood,\" until his face wore the preoccupied worried look that\r\nSurgeon Henry describes.\r\n\r\nThat both antagonists somewhat overacted their parts does not surprise\r\nus when we think of the five years thus spent within a narrow space\r\nand under a tropical sun. Lowe was at times pedantic, witness his\r\nrefusal to forward to Longwood books inscribed to the \"Emperor\r\nNapoleon,\" and his suspicions as to the political significance of\r\ngreen and white beans offered by Montholon to the French Commissioner,\r\nMontchenu. But such incidents can be paralleled from the lives of most\r\nofficials who bear a heavy burden of responsibility. And who has ever\r\nborne a heavier burden?[571]\r\n\r\nNapoleon also, in his calmer moods, regretted the violence of his\r\nlanguage to the Governor. He remarked to Montholon: \"This is the\r\nsecond time in my life that I have spoilt my affairs with the English.\r\nTheir phlegm leads me on, and I say more than I ought. I should have\r\ndone better not to have replied to him.\" This reference to his attack\r\non Whitworth in 1803 flashes a ray of light on the diatribe against\r\nLowe. In both cases, doubtless, the hot southron would have bridled\r\nhis passion sooner, had it produced any visible effect on the colder\r\nman of the north. Nevertheless, the scene of August 18th, 1816, had an\r\nabiding influence on his relations with the Governor. For the rest of\r\nthat weary span of years they never exchanged a word.\r\n\r\nLowe's official reports prove that he did not cease to consult the\r\ncomfort of the exiles as far as it was possible. The building of the\r\nnew house, however, remained in abeyance, as Napoleon refused to give\r\nany directions on the subject: and the much-needed repairs to Longwood\r\nwere stopped owing to his complaints of the noise of the workmen. But\r\nby ordering the claret that the ex-Emperor preferred, and by sending\r\noccasional presents of game to Longwood, Lowe sought to keep up the\r\nordinary civilities of life; and when the home Government sought to\r\nlimit the annual cost of the Longwood household to £8,000, Lowe took\r\nupon himself to increase that sum by one half.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's behaviour in this last affair is noteworthy. On hearing of\r\nthe need for greater economy, he readily assented, sent away seven\r\nservants, and ordered a reduction in the consumption of wine. A day or\r\ntwo later, however, he gave orders that some of his silver plate\r\nshould be sold in order \"to provide those little comforts denied\r\nthem.\" Balcombe was accordingly sent for, and, on expressing regret to\r\nNapoleon at the order for sale, received the reply: \"_What is the use\r\nof plate when you have nothing to eat off it?_\" Lowe quietly directed\r\nBalcombe to seal up the plate sent to him, and to advance money up to\r\nits value (£250); but other portions of the plate were broken and sold\r\nlater on. O'Meara reveals the reason for these proceedings in his\r\nletter of October 10th: \"In this he [Napoleon] has also a wish to\r\nexcite odium against the Governor by saying that he has been obliged\r\nto sell his plate in order to provide against starvation, _as he\r\nhimself told me was his object_.\"[572]\r\n\r\nAnother incident that embittered the relations between Napoleon and\r\nthe Governor was the arrival from England of more stringent\r\nregulations for his custody. The chief changes thus brought about\r\n(October 9th, 1816) were a restriction of the limits from a\r\ntwelve-mile to an eight-mile circumference and the posting of a ring\r\nof sentries at a slight distance from Longwood at sunset instead of at\r\n9 p.m.[573] The latter change is to be regretted; for it marred the\r\npleasure of Napoleon's evening strolls in his garden; but, as the\r\nGovernor pointed out, the three hours after sunset had been the\r\neasiest time for escape. The restriction of limits was needful, not\r\nonly in order to save our troops the labour of watching a wide area\r\nthat was scarcely ever used for exercise, but also to prevent\r\nunderhand intercourse with slaves.\r\n\r\nWas there really any need for these \"nation-degrading\" rules, as\r\nO'Meara called them? Or were they imposed in order to insult the great\r\nman? A reference to the British archives will show that there was some\r\nreason for them. Schemes of rescue were afoot that called for the\r\ngreatest vigilance.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen (page 527, note), a letter had on August 2nd, 1815,\r\nbeen directed to Mme. Bertrand (really for Napoleon) at Plymouth,\r\nstating that the writer had placed sums of money with well-known firms\r\nof Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charlestown on his behalf, and\r\nthat he (Napoleon) had only to make known his wishes \"_avec le thé de\r\nla Chine ou les mousselines de l'Inde_\": for the rest, the writer\r\nhoped much from English merchantmen. This letter, after wide\r\nwanderings, fell into our hands and caused our Government closely to\r\ninspect all letters and merchandise that passed into, or out of, St.\r\nHelena. Its attention was directed specially to the United States.\r\nThere the Napoleonic cult had early taken root, thanks to his\r\noverthrow of the kings and his easy sale of Louisiana; the glorifying\r\nhaze of distance fostered its growth; and now the martyrdom of St.\r\nHelena brought it to full maturity. Enthusiasm and money alike\r\nfavoured schemes of rescue.\r\n\r\nIn our St. Helena Records (No. 4) are reports as to two of them.\r\nForwarded by the Spanish Ambassador at Washington, the first reached\r\nMadrid on May 9th, 1816, and stated that a man named Carpenter had\r\noffered to Joseph Bonaparte (then in the States) to rescue Napoleon,\r\nand had set sail on a ship for that purpose. This was at once made\r\nknown to Lord Bathurst, our Minister for War and the Plantations, who\r\nforwarded it to Lowe. In August of that year our Foreign Office also\r\nreceived news that four schooners and other smaller vessels had set\r\nsail from Baltimore on June 14th with 300 men under an old French\r\nnaval officer, named Fournier, ostensibly to help Bolivar, but really\r\nto rescue Bonaparte. These fast-sailing craft were to lie out of sight\r\nof the island by day, creep up at night to different points, and send\r\nboats to shore; from each of these a man, _in English uniform_, was to\r\nland and proceed to Longwood, warning Napoleon of the points where the\r\nboats would be ready to receive him. The report concludes:\r\n\"Considerable sums in gold and diamonds will be put at his disposal to\r\nbribe those who may be necessary to him. They seem to flatter\r\nthemselves of a certain co-operation on the part of certain\r\nindividuals domiciled or employed at St. Helena.\"[574]\r\n\r\nBathurst sent on to Lowe a copy of this intelligence. Forsyth does not\r\nname the affair, though he refers to other warnings, received at\r\nvarious times by Bathurst and forwarded to the Governor, that there\r\nwere traitors in the island who had been won over by Napoleon's gold\r\nto aid his escape.[575] I cannot find out that the plans described\r\nabove were put to the test, though suspicious vessels sometimes\r\nappeared and were chased away by our cruisers. But when we are\r\nconsidering the question whether Bathurst and Lowe were needlessly\r\nstrict or not, the point at issue is _whether plans of escape or\r\nrescue existed, and if so, whether they knew of them_. As to this\r\nthere cannot be the shadow of doubt; and it is practically certain\r\nthat they were the cause of the new regulations of October 9th, 1816.\r\n\r\nWe have now traced the course of events during the first critical\r\ntwelvemonth; we have seen how friction burst into a flame, how the\r\nchafing of that masterful spirit against all restraint served but to\r\ntighten the inclosing grasp, and how the attempts of his misguided\r\nfriends in America and Europe changed a fairly lax detention into\r\nactual custody. It is a vain thing to toy with the \"might-have-beens\"\r\nof history; but we can fancy a man less untamable than Napoleon\r\nfrankly recognizing that he had done with active life by assuming a\r\nfeigned name (_e.g._, that of Colonel Muiron, which he once thought\r\nof) and settling down in that equable retreat to the congenial task of\r\ncompiling his personal and military Memoirs. If he ever intended to\r\nlive as a country squire in England, there were equal facilities for\r\nsuch a life in St. Helena, with no temptations to stray back into\r\npolitics. The climate was better for him than that of England, and the\r\npossibilities for exercise greater than could there have been allowed.\r\nBooks there were in abundance--2,700 of them at last: he had back\r\nfiles of the \"Moniteur\" for his writings, and copies of \"The Times\"\r\ncame regularly from Plantation House: a piano had been bought in\r\nEngland for £120. Finally there were the six courtiers whose jealous\r\ndevotion, varying moods, and frequent quarrels furnished a daily\r\ncomedietta that still charms posterity.\r\n\r\nWhat then was wanting? Unfortunately everything was wanting. He cared\r\nnot for music, or animals, or, in recent years, for the chase. He\r\nhimself divulged the secret, in words uttered to Gallois in the days\r\nof his power: \"_Je n'aime pas beaucoup les femmes, ni le jeu--enfin\r\nrien: je suis tout à fait un être politique!_\"--He never ceased to\r\nlove politics and power. At St. Helena he pictured himself as winning\r\nover the English, had he settled there. Ah! if I were in England, he\r\nsaid, I should have conquered all hearts.[576] And assuredly he would\r\nhave done so. How could men so commonplace as the Prince Regent,\r\nLiverpool, Castlereagh, and Bathurst have made head against the\r\ninfluence of a truly great and enthralling personality? Or if he had\r\ngone to the United States, who would have competed with him for the\r\nPresidency?\r\n\r\nAs it was, he chose to remain indoors, in order to figure as the\r\nprisoner of Longwood,[577] and spent his time between intrigues\r\nagainst Lowe and dictation of Memoirs. On the subject of Napoleon's\r\nwritings we cannot here enter, save to say that his critiques of\r\nCæsar, Turenne, and Frederick the Great, are of great interest and\r\nvalue; that the records of his own campaigns, though highly\r\nsuggestive, need to be closely checked by the original documents,\r\nseeing that he had not all the needful facts and figures at hand; and\r\nthat his record of political events is in the main untrustworthy: it\r\nis an elaborate device for enhancing the Napoleonic tradition and\r\nassuring the crown to the King of Rome.\r\n\r\nWe turn, then, to take a brief glance at his last years. The first\r\nevent that claims notice is the arrest of Las Cases. This subtle\r\nintriguer had soon earned the hatred of Montholon and Gourgaud, who\r\ndetested \"the little Jesuit\" for his Malvolio-like airs of importance\r\nand the hints of Napoleon that he would have ceremonial precedence\r\nover them. His rapid rise into favour was due to his conversational\r\ngifts, literary ability, and thorough knowledge of the English people\r\nand language. This last was specially important. Napoleon very much\r\nwished to learn our language, as he hoped that any mail might bring\r\nnews of the triumph of the Whigs and an order for his own departure\r\nfor England. His studies with Las Cases were more persevering than\r\nsuccessful, as will be seen from the following curious letter, written\r\napparently in the watches of the night: it has been recently\r\nre-published by M. de Brotonne.\r\n\r\n    \"COUNT LASCASES,\r\n\r\n    \"Since sixt week y learn the English and y do not any progress.\r\n    Sixt week do fourty and two day. If might have learn fivty word,\r\n    for day, i could know it two thousands and two hundred. It is in\r\n    the dictionary more of fourty thousand: even he could most twenty;\r\n    bot much of tems. For know it or hundred and twenty week, which do\r\n    more two years. After this you shall agree that the study one\r\n    tongue is a great labour who it must do into the young aged.\"\r\n\r\nHow much farther Napoleon progressed in his efforts to absorb our\r\nlanguage by these mathematical methods we do not know; for no other\r\nEnglish letter of his seems to be extant. The arrest and departure of\r\nhis tutor soon occurred, and there are good grounds for assigning this\r\nultimately to the jealousy of the less cultured Generals. Thus, we\r\nfind Gourgaud asserting that Las Cases has come to St. Helena solely\r\n\"in order to get talked about, write anecdotes, and make money.\"\r\nMontholon also did his best to render the secretary's life miserable,\r\nand on one occasion predicted to Gourgaud that Las Cases would soon\r\nleave the island.[578]\r\n\r\nThe forecast speedily came true. The secretary intrusted to his\r\nservant, a dubious mulatto named Scott, two letters for Europe sewn up\r\nin a waistcoat: one of them was a long letter to Lucien Bonaparte. The\r\nservant showed the letters to his father, who in some alarm revealed\r\nthe matter to the Governor. It is curious as illustrating the state of\r\nsuspicion then prevalent at St. Helena, that Las Cases accused the\r\nScotts of being tools of the Governor; that Lowe saw in the affair the\r\nfrayed end of a Longwood scheme; while the residents there suspected\r\nLas Cases of arranging matters as a means of departure from the\r\nisland. There was much to justify this last surmise. Las Cases and his\r\nson were unwell; their position in the household was very\r\nuncomfortable; and for a skilled intriguer to intrust an important\r\nletter to a slave, who was already in the Governor's black books, was\r\ntruly a singular proceeding. Besides, after the arrest, when the\r\nGovernor searched Las Cases' papers in his presence, they were found\r\nto be in good order, among them being parts of his \"Journal.\" Napoleon\r\nhimself thought Las Cases guilty of a piece of extraordinary folly,\r\nthough he soon sought to make capital out of the arrest by comparing\r\nthe behaviour of our officers and their orderlies with \"South Sea\r\nsavages dancing around a prisoner that they are about to devour.\"[579]\r\nAfter a short detention at Ross Cottage, _when he declined the\r\nGovernor's offer that he should return to Longwood_, the secretary was\r\nsent to the Cape, and thence made his way to France, where a judicious\r\nediting of his \"Memoirs\" and \"Journal\" gained for their compiler a\r\nrich reward.\r\n\r\nGourgaud is the next to leave. The sensitive young man has long been\r\ntormented by jealousy. His diary becomes the long-drawn sigh of a\r\ngenerous but vain nature, when soured by real or fancied neglect.\r\nThough often unfair to Napoleon, whose egotism the slighted devotee\r\noften magnifies into colossal proportions, the writer unconsciously\r\nbears witness to the wondrous fascination that held the little Court\r\nin awe. The least attention shown to the Montholons costs \"Gogo\" a fit\r\nof spleen or a sleepless night, scarcely to be atoned for on the\r\nmorrow by soothing words, by chess, or reversi, or help at the\r\nmanuscript of \"Waterloo.\" Again and again Napoleon tries to prove to\r\nhim that the Montholons ought to have precedence: it is in vain. At\r\nlast the crisis comes: it is four years since the General saved the\r\nEmperor from a Cossack's lance at Brienne, and the recollection\r\nrenders his present \"humiliations\" intolerable. He challenges\r\nMontholon to a duel; Napoleon strictly forbids it; and the aggrieved\r\nofficer seeks permission to depart.\r\n\r\nNapoleon grants his request. It seems that the chief is weary of his\r\nmoody humours; he further owes him a grudge for writing home to his\r\nmother frank statements of the way in which the Longwood exiles are\r\ntreated. These letters were read by Lowe and Bathurst, and their\r\ngeneral purport seems to have been known in French governmental\r\ncircles, where they served as an antidote to the poisonous stories\r\ncirculated by Napoleon and his more diplomatic followers. Clearly\r\nnothing is to be made of Gourgaud; and so he departs (February 13th,\r\n1818). Bidding a tearful adieu, he goes with Basil Jackson to spend\r\nsix weeks with him at a cottage near Plantation House, when he is\r\nastonished at the delicate reserve shown by the Governor. He then sets\r\nsail for England. The only money he has is _£100_ advanced by Lowe.\r\nNapoleon's money he has refused to accept.[580]\r\n\r\nAnd yet he did not pass out of his master's life. Landing in England\r\non May 1st, he had a few interviews with our officials, in which he\r\nwarned them that Napoleon's escape would be quite easy, and gave a\r\nhint as to O'Meara being the tool of Napoleon. But soon the young\r\nGeneral came into touch with the leaders of the Opposition. No change\r\nin his sentiments is traceable until August 25th, when he indited a\r\nletter to Marie Louise, asserting that Napoleon was dying \"in the\r\ntorments of the longest and most frightful agony,\" a prey to the\r\ncruelty of England! To what are we to attribute this change of front?\r\nThe editors of Gourgaud's \"Journal\" maintain that there was no change;\r\nthey hint that the \"Journal\" may have been an elaborate device for\r\nthrowing dust into Lowe's eyes; and they point to the fact that before\r\nleaving the island Gourgaud received secret instructions from Napoleon\r\nbidding him convey to Europe several small letters sewn into the soles\r\nof his boots. Whether he acted on these instructions may be doubted;\r\nfor at his departure he gave his word of honour to Lowe that he was\r\nnot the bearer of any paper, pamphlet, or letter from Longwood.\r\nFurthermore, we hear nothing of these secret letters afterwards; and\r\nhe allowed nearly four months to elapse in England before he wrote to\r\nMarie Louise. The theory referred to above seems quite untenable in\r\nface of these facts.[581]\r\n\r\nHow, then, are we to explain Gourgaud's conduct at St. Helena and\r\nafterwards? Now, in threading the mendacious labyrinths of St. Helena\r\nliterature it is hard ever to find a wholly satisfactory clue; but\r\nBasil Jackson's \"Waterloo and St. Helena\" (p. 103) seems to supply it\r\nin the following passage:\r\n\r\n    \"To finish about Gourgaud, I may add that on his reaching England,\r\n    after one or two interviews with the Under-Secretary of State, he\r\n    fell into the hands of certain Radicals of note, who represented\r\n    to him the folly of his conduct in turning against Napoleon; that,\r\n    as his adherent, he was really somebody, whereas he was only\r\n    ruining himself by appearing inimical. In short, they so worked\r\n    upon the poor weak man, that he was induced to try and make it\r\n    appear that he was still _l'homme de l'Empereur:_ this he did by\r\n    inditing a letter to Marie Louise, in which he inveighed against\r\n    the treatment of Napoleon at the hands of the Government and Sir\r\n    H. Lowe, which being duly published, Gourgaud fell to zero in the\r\n    opinion of all right-minded persons.\"\r\n\r\nThis seems consonant with what we know of Gourgaud's character: frank,\r\nvolatile, and sensitive, he could never have long sustained a policy\r\nof literary and diplomatic deceit. He was not a compound of Chatterton\r\nand Fouché. His \"Journal\" is the artless outpouring of wounded vanity\r\nand brings us close to the heart of the hero-worshipper and his hero.\r\nAt times the idol falls and is shivered but love places it on the\r\nshrine again and again, until the fourth anniversary of Brienne finds\r\nthe spell broken. Even before he leaves St. Helena the old fascination\r\nis upon him once more; and then Napoleon seeks to utilize his devotion\r\nfor the purpose of a political mission. Gourgaud declines the _rôle_\r\nof agent, pledges his word to the Governor, and keeps it; but, thanks\r\nto British officialism or the seductions of the Opposition,\r\nhero-worship once more gains the day and enrolls him beside Las Cases\r\nand Montholon. This we believe to be the real Gourgaud, a genuine,\r\nlovable, but flighty being, as every page of his \"Journal\" shows.\r\n\r\nOne cannot but notice in passing the extraordinary richness of St.\r\nHelena literature. Nearly all the exiles kept diaries or memoirs, or\r\nwrote them when they returned to Europe. And, on the other hand, of\r\nall the 10,000 Britons whom Napoleon detained in France for eleven\r\nyears, not one has left a record that is ever read to-day.\r\nConsequently, while the woes of Napoleon have been set forth in every\r\ncivilized tongue, the world has forgotten the miseries causelessly\r\ninflicted on 10,000 English families. The advantages possessed by a\r\nmemoir-writing nation over one that is but half articulate could not\r\nbe better illustrated. For the dumb Britons not a single tear is ever\r\nshed; whereas the voluble inmates of Longwood used their pens to such\r\neffect that half the world still believes them to have been bullied\r\ntwice a week by Lowe, plied with gifts of poisoned coffee, and nearly\r\neaten up by rats at night. On this last topic we are treated to tales\r\nof part of a slave's leg being eaten off while he slept at\r\nLongwood--nay, of a horse's leg also being gnawed away at night--so\r\nthat our feelings are divided between pity for the sufferers and envy\r\nat the soundness of their slumbers.\r\n\r\nLongwood was certainly far from being a suitable abode; but a word\r\nfrom Napoleon would have led to the erection of the new house on a\r\nsite that he chose to indicate. The materials had all been brought\r\nfrom England; but the word was not spoken until a much later time; and\r\nthe inference is inevitable that he preferred to remain where he was\r\nso that he could represent himself as lodged in _cette grange\r\ninsalubre._[582] The third of the Longwood household to depart was the\r\nsurgeon, O'Meara. The conduct of this British officer in facilitating\r\nNapoleon's secret correspondence has been so fully exposed by Forsyth\r\nand Seaton that we may refer our readers to their works for proofs of\r\nhis treachery. Gourgaud's \"Journal\" reveals the secret influence that\r\nseduced him. Chancing once to refer to the power of money over\r\nEnglishmen, Napoleon remarked that that was why we did not want him to\r\ndraw sums from Europe, and continued: \"_Le docteur n'est si bien pour\r\nmoi que depuis que je lui donne mon argent. Ah! j'en suis bien sûr, de\r\ncelui-là!\"_[583] This disclosure enables us to understand why the\r\nsurgeon, after being found out and dismissed from the service, sought\r\nto blacken the character of Sir Hudson Lowe by every conceivable\r\ndevice. The wonder is that he succeeded in imposing his version of\r\nfacts on a whole generation.\r\n\r\nThe next physician who resided at Longwood, Dr. Stokoe, was speedily\r\ncajoled into disobeying the British regulations and underwent official\r\ndisgrace. An attempt was then made, through Montholon, to bribe his\r\nsuccessor, Dr. Verling, who indignantly repelled it and withdrew from\r\nhis duty.[584]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that Napoleon found pleasure in these intrigues.\r\nIn his last interview with Stürmer, the Austrian Commissioner at St.\r\nHelena, Gourgaud said, in reference to this topic: \"However unhappy he\r\n[Napoleon] is here, he secretly enjoys the importance attached to his\r\ncustody, the interest that the Powers take in it, and the care taken\r\nto collect his least words.\" Napoleon also once remarked to Gourgaud\r\nthat it was better to be at St. Helena than as he was at Elba.[585] Of\r\nthe same general tenour are his striking remarks, reported by Las\r\nCases at the close of his first volume:\r\n\r\n    \"Our situation here may even have its attractions. The universe is\r\n    looking at us. We remain the martyrs of an immortal cause:\r\n    millions of men weep for us, the fatherland sighs, and Glory is in\r\n    mourning. We struggle here against the oppression of the gods, and\r\n    the longings of the nations are for us.... Adversity was wanting\r\n    to my career. If I had died on the throne amidst the clouds of my\r\n    omnipotence, I should have remained a problem for many men:\r\n    to-day, thanks to misfortune, they can judge of me naked as I am.\"\r\n\r\nIn terseness of phrase, vividness of fancy, and keenness of insight\r\ninto the motives that sway mankind, this passage is worthy of\r\nNapoleon. He knew that his exile at St. Helena would dull the memory\r\nof the wrongs which he had done to the cause of liberty, and that from\r\nthat lonely peak would go forth the legend of the new Prometheus\r\nchained to the rock by the kings and torn every day by the ravening\r\nvulture. The world had rejected his gospel of force; but would it not\r\nthrill responsive to the gospel of pity now to be enlisted in his\r\nbehalf? His surmise was amazingly true. The world was thrilled. The\r\nstory worked wonders, not directly for him, but for his fame and his\r\ndynasty. The fortunes of his race began to revive from the time when\r\nthe popular imagination transfigured Napoleon the Conqueror into\r\nNapoleon the Martyr. Viewed in this light, and thrown up into telling\r\nrelief against the sinister policy of the Holy Alliance of the\r\nmonarchs, the dreary years spent at St. Helena were not the least\r\nsuccessful of his career. Without them there could have been no second\r\nNapoleonic Empire.\r\n\r\nNot that his life there was a \"long-drawn agony.\" His health was\r\nfairly good. There were seasons of something like enjoyment, when he\r\ngave himself up to outdoor recreations. Such a time was the latter\r\npart of 1819 and the first half of 1820: we may call it the Indian\r\nsummer of his life, for he was then possessed with a passion for\r\ngardening. Lightly clad and protected by a broad-brimmed hat, he went\r\nabout, sometimes spade in hand, superintending various changes in the\r\ngrounds at Longwood and around the new house which was being erected\r\nfor him hard by. Or at other times he used the opportunity afforded by\r\nthe excavations to show how infantry might be so disposed on a hastily\r\nraised slope as to bring a terrific fire to bear on attacking cavalry.\r\nMarshalling his followers at dawn by the sound of a bell, he made them\r\nall, counts, valets, and servants, dig trenches as if for the front\r\nranks, and throw up the earth for the rear ranks: then, taking his\r\nstand in front, as the shortest man, and placing the tallest at the\r\nrear (his Swiss valet, Noverraz), he triumphantly showed how the\r\nhorsemen might be laid low by the rolling volleys of ten ranks.[586]\r\nIn May or June he took once more to horse exercise, and for a time his\r\nhealth benefited from all this activity. His relations with the\r\nGovernor were peaceful, if not cordial, and the limits were about this\r\ntime extended.\r\n\r\nIndoors there were recreations other than work at the Memoirs. He\r\noften played chess and billiards, at the latter using his hand instead\r\nof the cue! Dinner was generally at a very late hour, and afterwards\r\nhe took pleasure in reading aloud. Voltaire was the favourite author,\r\nand Montholon afterwards confessed to Lord Holland that the same\r\nplays, especially \"Zaïre,\" were read rather too often.\r\n\r\n    \"Napoleon slept himself when read to, but he was very observant\r\n    and jealous if others slept while he read. He watched his audience\r\n    vigilantly, and _'Mme. Montholon, vous dormez'_ was a frequent\r\n    ejaculation in the course of reading. He was animated with all\r\n    that he read, especially poetry, enthusiastic at beautiful\r\n    passages, impatient of faults, and full of ingenious and lively\r\n    remarks on style.\"[587]\r\n\r\nDuring this same halcyon season two priests, who had been selected by\r\nthe Bonapartes, arrived in the island, as also a Corsican doctor,\r\nAntommarchi. Napoleon was disappointed with all three. The doctor,\r\nthough a learned anatomist, knew little of chemistry, and at an early\r\ninterview with Napoleon passed a catechism on this subject so badly\r\nthat he was all but chased from the room. The priests came off little\r\nbetter. The elder of them, Buonavita by name, had lived in Mexico, and\r\ncould talk of little else: he soon fell ill, and his stay in St.\r\nHelena was short. The other, a Corsican named Vignali, having neither\r\nlearning, culture, nor dialectical skill, was tolerated as a\r\nrespectable adjunct to the household, but had little or no influence\r\nover the master. This is to be regretted on many grounds, and partly\r\nbecause his testimony throws no light on Napoleon's religious views.\r\n\r\nHere we approach a problem that perhaps can never be cleared up.\r\nUnfathomable on many sides of his nature, Napoleon is nowhere more so\r\nthan when he confronts the eternal verities. That he was a convinced\r\nand orthodox Catholic few will venture to assert. At Elba he said to\r\nLord Ebrington: \"_Nous ne savons d'où nous venons, ce que nous\r\ndeviendrons_\": the masses ought to have some \"fixed point of faith\r\nwhereon to rest their thoughts.\"--\"_Je suis Catholique parce que mon\r\npère l'étoit, et parce que c'étoit la religion de la France_.\" He also\r\nonce or twice expressed to Campbell scorn of the popular creed: and\r\nduring his last voyage, as we have seen, he showed not the slightest\r\ninterest in the offer of a priest at Funchal to accompany him. At St.\r\nHelena the party seems to have limited the observances of religion to\r\noccasional reading of the Bible. When Mme. Montholon presented her\r\nbabe to the Emperor, he teasingly remarked that Las Cases was the most\r\nsuitable person to christen the infant; to which the mother at once\r\nreplied that Las Cases was not a good enough Christian for that.\r\n\r\nJudging from the entries in Gourgaud's \"Journal,\" this young General\r\npondered more than the rest on religious questions; and to him\r\nNapoleon unbosomed his thoughts.--Matter, he says, is everywhere and\r\npervades everything; life, thought, and the soul itself are but\r\nproperties of matter, and death ends all. When Gourgaud points to the\r\nmajestic order of the universe as bearing witness to a Creator,\r\nNapoleon admits that he believes in \"superior intelligences\": he avers\r\nthat he would believe in Christianity if it had been the original and\r\nuniversal creed: but then the Mohammedans \"follow a religion simpler\r\nand more adapted to their morality than ours.\" In ten years their\r\nfounder conquered half the world, which Christianity took three\r\nhundred years to accomplish. Or again, he refers to the fact that\r\nLaplace, Monge, Berthollet, and Lagrange were all atheists, though\r\nthey did not proclaim the fact; as for himself, he finds the idea of\r\nGod to be natural; it has existed at all times and among all peoples.\r\nBut once or twice he ends this vague talk with the remarkable\r\nconfession that the sight of myriad deaths in war has made him a\r\nmaterialist. \"Matter is everything.\"--\"Vanity of vanities!\"[588]\r\n\r\nMirrored as these dialogues are in the eddies of Gourgaud's moods,\r\nthey may tinge his master's theology with too much of gloom: but,\r\nafter all, they are by far the most lifelike record of Napoleon's\r\nlater years, and they show us a nature dominated by the tangible. As\r\nfor belief in the divine Christ, there seems not a trace. A report has\r\ncome down to us, enshrined in Newman's prose, that Napoleon once\r\ndiscoursed of the ineffable greatness of Christ, contrasting His\r\nenduring hold on the hearts of men with the evanescent rule of\r\nAlexander and Cæsar. One hopes that the words were uttered; but they\r\nconflict with Napoleon's undoubted statements. Sometimes he spoke in\r\nutter uncertainty; at others, as one who wished to believe in\r\nChristianity and might perhaps be converted. But in the political\r\ntestament designed for his son, the only reference to religion is of\r\nthe diplomatic description that we should expect from the author of\r\nthe \"Concordat\": \"Religious ideas have more influence than certain\r\nnarrow-minded philosophers are willing to believe: they are capable of\r\nrendering great services to Humanity. By standing well with the Pope,\r\nan influence is still maintained over the consciences of a hundred\r\nmillions of men.\"\r\n\r\nEqually vague was Napoleon's own behaviour as his end drew nigh. For\r\nsome time past a sharp internal pain--the stab of a penknife, he\r\ncalled it--had warned him of his doom; in April, 1821, when vomiting\r\nand prostration showed that the dread ancestral malady was drawing on\r\napace, he bade the Abbé Vignali prepare the large dining-room of\r\nLongwood as a _chapelle ardente_; and, observing a smile on\r\nAntommarchi's face, the sick man hotly rebuked his affectation of\r\nsuperiority. Montholon, on his return to England, informed Lord\r\nHolland that extreme unction was administered before the end came,\r\nNapoleon having ordered that this should be done as if solely on\r\nMontholon's responsibility, and that the priest, when questioned on\r\nthe subject, was to reply that he had acted on Montholon's orders,\r\nwithout having any knowledge of the Emperor's wishes. It was\r\naccordingly administered, but apparently he was insensible at the\r\ntime.[589] In his will, also, he declared that he died in communion\r\nwith the Apostolical Roman Church, in whose bosom he was born. There,\r\nthen, we must leave this question, shrouded in the mystery that hangs\r\naround so much of his life.\r\n\r\nThe decease of a great man is always affecting: but the death of the\r\nhero who had soared to the zenith of military glory and civic\r\nachievement seems to touch the very nadir of calamity. Outliving his\r\nmighty Empire, girt around by a thousand miles of imprisoning ocean,\r\nguarded by his most steadfast enemies, his son a captive at the Court\r\nof the Hapsburgs, and his Empress openly faithless, he sinks from\r\nsight like some battered derelict. And Nature is more pitiless than\r\nman. The Governor urges on him the best medical advice: but he will\r\nhave none of it. He feels the grip of cancer, the disease which had\r\ncarried off his father and was to claim the gay Caroline and Pauline.\r\nAt times he surmises the truth: at others he calls out \"_le foie_\"\r\n\"_le foie_.\" Meara had alleged that his pains were due to a liver\r\ncomplaint brought on by his detention at St. Helena; Antommarchi\r\ndescribed the illness as gastric fever (_febbre gastrica pituitosa_);\r\nand not until Dr. Arnott was called in on the 1st of April was the\r\ntruth fully recognized.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the month the symptoms became most distressing,\r\naggravated as they were by the refusal of the patient to take medicine\r\nor food, or to let himself be moved. On May 4th, at Dr. Arnott's\r\ninsistence, some calomel was secretly administered and with beneficial\r\nresults, the patient sleeping and even taking some food. This was his\r\nlast rally: on the morrow, while a storm was sweeping over the island,\r\nand tearing up large trees, his senses began to fail: Montholon\r\nthought he heard the words _France, armée, tête d'armée, Joséphine_:\r\nhe lingered on insensible for some hours: the storm died down: the sun\r\nbathed the island in a flood of glory, and, as it dipped into the\r\nocean, the great man passed away.\r\n\r\nBy the Governor's orders Dr. Arnott remained in the room until the\r\nbody could be medically examined--a precaution which, as Montchenu\r\npointed out, would prevent any malicious attempt on the part of the\r\nLongwood servants to cause death to appear as the result of poisoning.\r\nThe examination, conducted in the presence of seven medical men and\r\nothers, proved that all the organs were sound except the ulcerated\r\nstomach; the liver was rather large, but showed no signs of disease;\r\nthe heart, on the other hand, was rather under the normal size. Far\r\nfrom showing the emaciation that usually results from prolonged\r\ninability to take food, the body was remarkably stout--a fact which\r\nshows that that tenacious will had its roots in an abnormally firm\r\nvitality.[590]\r\n\r\nAfter being embalmed, the body was laid out in state, and all\r\nbeholders were struck with the serene and beautiful expression of the\r\nface: the superfluous flesh sank away after death, leaving the\r\nwell-proportioned features that moved the admiration of men during the\r\nConsulate.\r\n\r\nClad in his favourite green uniform, he fared forth to his\r\nresting-place under two large weeping willow trees in a secluded\r\nvalley: the coffin, surmounted by his sword and the cloak he had worn\r\nat Marengo, was borne with full military honours by grenadiers of the\r\n20th and 66th Regiments before a long line of red-coats; and their\r\nbanners, emblazoned with the names of \"Talavera,\" \"Albuera,\"\r\n\"Pyrenees,\" and \"Orthez,\" were lowered in a last salute to our mighty\r\nfoe. Salvos of artillery and musketry were fired over the grave: the\r\nechoes rattled upwards from ridge to ridge and leaped from the\r\nsplintery peaks far into the wastes of ocean to warn the world beyond\r\nthat the greatest warrior and administrator of all the ages had sunk\r\nto rest.\r\n\r\nHis ashes were not to remain in that desolate nook: in a clause of his\r\nwill he expressed the desire that they should rest by the banks of the\r\nSeine among the people he had loved so well. In 1840 they were\r\ndisinterred in presence of Bertrand, Gourgaud, and Marchand, and borne\r\nto France. Paris opened her arms to receive the mighty dead; and Louis\r\nPhilippe, on whom he had once prophesied that the crown of France\r\nwould one day rest, received the coffin in state under the dome of the\r\n_Invalides_. There he reposes, among the devoted people whom by his\r\nsuperhuman genius he raised to bewildering heights of glory, only to\r\ndash them to the depths of disaster by his monstrous errors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nViewing his career as a whole, it seems just and fair to assert that\r\nthe fundamental cause of his overthrow is to be found, not in the\r\nfailings of the French, for they served him with a fidelity that would\r\nwring tears of pity from Rhadamanthus; not in the treachery of this or\r\nthat general or politician, for that is little when set against the\r\nloyalty of forty millions of men; but in the character of the man and\r\nof his age. Never had mortal man so grand an opportunity of ruling\r\nover a chaotic Continent: never had any great leader antagonists so\r\nfeeble as the rulers who opposed his rush to supremacy. At the dawn of\r\nthe nineteenth century the old monarchies were effete: insanity\r\nreigned in four dynasties, and weak or time-serving counsels swayed\r\nthe remainder. For several years their counsellors and generals were\r\nlittle better. With the exception of Pitt and Nelson, who were carried\r\noff by death, and of Wellington, who had but half an army, Napoleon\r\nnever came face to face with thoroughly able, well-equipped, and\r\nstubborn opponents until the year 1812.\r\n\r\nIt seems a paradox to say that this excess of good fortune largely\r\ncontributed to his ruin: yet it is true. His was one of those\r\nthick-set combative natures that need timely restraint if their best\r\nqualities are to be nurtured and their domineering instincts curbed.\r\nJust as the strongest Ministry prances on to ruin if the Opposition\r\ngives no effective check, so it was with Napoleon. Had he in his early\r\nmanhood taken to heart the lessons of adversity, would he have\r\nventured at the same time to fight Wellington in Spain and the Russian\r\nclimate in the heart of the steppes? Would he have spurned the offers\r\nof an advantageous peace made to him from Prague in 1813? Would he\r\nhave let slip the chance of keeping the \"natural frontiers\" of France\r\nafter Leipzig, and her old boundaries, when brought to bay in\r\nChampagne? Would he have dared the uttermost at all points at\r\nWaterloo? In truth, after his fortieth year was past, the fervid\r\nenergies of youth hardened in the mould of triumph; and thence came\r\nthat fatal obstinacy which was his bane at all those crises of his\r\ncareer. For in the meantime the cause of European independence had\r\nfound worthy champions--smaller men than Napoleon, it is true, but men\r\nwho knew that his determination to hold out everywhere and yield\r\nnothing must work his ruin. Finally, the same clinging to unreal hopes\r\nand the same love of fight characterized his life in St. Helena; so\r\nthat what might have been a time of calm and dignified repose was\r\nmarred by fictitious clamours and petty intrigues altogether unworthy\r\nof his greatness.\r\n\r\nFor, in spite of his prodigious failure, he was superlatively great in\r\nall that pertains to government, the quickening of human energies, and\r\nthe art of war. His greatness lies, not only in the abiding importance\r\nof his best undertakings, but still more in the Titanic force that he\r\nthrew into the inception and accomplishment of all of them--a force\r\nwhich invests the storm-blasted monoliths strewn along the latter\r\nportion of his career with a majesty unapproachable by a tamer race of\r\ntoilers. After all, the verdict of mankind awards the highest\r\ndistinction, not to prudent mediocrity that shuns the chance of\r\nfailure and leaves no lasting mark behind, but to the eager soul that\r\ngrandly dares, mightily achieves, and holds the hearts of millions\r\neven amidst his ruin and theirs. Such a wonder-worker was Napoleon.\r\nThe man who bridled the Revolution and remoulded the life of France,\r\nwho laid broad and deep the foundations of a new life in Italy,\r\nSwitzerland, and Germany, who rolled the West in on the East in the\r\ngreatest movement known since the Crusades and finally drew the\r\nyearning thoughts of myriads to that solitary rock in the South\r\nAtlantic, must ever stand in the very forefront of the immortals of\r\nhuman story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nLIST OF THE CHIEF APPOINTMENTS AND DIGNITIES BESTOWED BY NAPOLEON\r\n\r\n[_An asterisk is affixed to the names of his Marshals_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n   Arrighi.

We now know that\r\nthe Prussian advance was retarded by Gneisenau's deep-rooted suspicion\r\nof Wellington, and that no direct aid was given to the British left\r\nuntil nearly the end of the battle. Napoleon always held that he could\r\nreadily have kept off the Prussians at Planchenoit, that the main\r\nbattle throughout was against Wellington, and that it was decided by\r\nthe final charge of British cavalry. The Prussians did not wholly\r\ncapture Planchenoit until the French opposing Wellington were in full\r\nflight. But, of course, Blücher's advance and onset made the victory\r\nthe overwhelming triumph that it was.\r\n\r\nAn able critic in the \"Saturday Review\" of May 10, 1902, has charged\r\nme with neglecting to say that the French left wing (Foy's and\r\nBachelu's divisions) supported the French cavalry at the close of the\r\ngreat charges. I stated (p. 502) that French infantry was not \"at hand\r\nto hold the ground which the cavaliers seemed to have won.\" Let me\r\ncite the exact words of General Foy, written in his Journal a few days\r\nafter the battle (M. Girod de L'Ain's \"Vie militaire du General Foy,\"\r\np. 278): \"Alors que la cavalerie française faisait cette longue et\r\nterrible charge, le feu de notre artillerie était déjà moins nourri,\r\net notre infanterie ne fit aucun mouvement. Quand la cavalerie fut\r\nrentrée, et que l'artillerie anglaise, qui avait cessé de tirer\r\npendant une demi-heure, eut recommencé son feu, on donna ordre aux\r\ndivisions Foy et Bachelu d'avancer droit aux carrés qui s'y étaient\r\navancés pendant la charge de cavalerie et qui ne s'étaient pas\r\nrepliés. L'attaque fut formée en colonnes par échelons de régiment,\r\nBachelu formant les échelons les plus avancés. Je tenis par ma gauche\r\nà la haie [de Hougoumont]: j'avais sur mon front un bataillon en\r\ntirailleurs. Près de joindre les Anglais, nous avons reçu un feu très\r\nvif de mitraille et de mousqueterie. C'était une grêle de mort. Les\r\ncarrés ennemis avaient le premier rang genoux en terre et présentaient\r\nune haie de baïonettes. Les colonnes de la 1're division ont pris la\r\nfuite les premières: leur mouvement a entraîné celui de mes colonnes.\r\nEn ce moment j'ai été blessé....\"\r\n\r\nThis shows that the advance of the French infantry was far too late to\r\nbe of the slightest use to the cavalry. The British lines had been\r\ncompletely re-formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES TO VOLUME I:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From a French work, \"Moeurs et Coutumes des Corses\"\r\n(Paris, 1802), I take the following incident. A priest, charged with\r\nthe duty of avenging a relative for some fourteen years, met his enemy\r\nat the gate of Ajaccio and forthwith shot him, under the eyes of an\r\nofficial--who did nothing. A relative of the murdered man, happening\r\nto be near, shot the priest. Both victims were quickly buried, the\r\npriest being interred under the altar of the church, \"because of his\r\nsacred character.\" See too Miot de Melito, \"Mémoires,\" vol. i., ch.\r\nxiii., as to the utter collapse of the jury system in 1800-1, because\r\nno Corsican would \"deny his party or desert his blood.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: As to the tenacity of Corsican devotion, I may cite a\r\ncurious proof from the unpublished portion of the \"Memoirs of Sir\r\nHudson Lowe.\" He was colonel in command of the Royal Corsican Rangers,\r\nenrolled during the British occupation of Corsica, and gained the\r\naffections of his men during several years of fighting in Egypt and\r\nelsewhere. When stationed at Capri in 1808 he relied on his Corsican\r\nlevies to defend that island against Murat's attacks; and he did not\r\nrely in vain. Though confronted by a French Corsican regiment, they\r\nremained true to their salt, even during a truce, when they could\r\nrecognize their compatriots. The partisan instinct was proof against\r\nthe promises of Murat's envoys and the shouts even of kith and kin.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The facts as to the family of Napoleon's mother are given\r\nin full detail by M. Masson in his \"Napoléon Inconnu,\" ch. i. They\r\ncorrect the statement often made as to her \"lowly,\" \"peasant\" origin.\r\nMasson also proves that the house at Ajaccio, which is shown as\r\nNapoleon's birthplace, is of later construction, though on the same\r\nsite.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: See Jacobi, \"Hist. de la Corse,\" vol. ii., ch. viii. The\r\nwhole story is told with prudent brevity by French historians, even by\r\nMasson and Chuquet. The few words in which Thiers dismisses this\r\nsubject are altogether misleading.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Much has been written to prove that Napoleon was born in\r\n1768, and was really the eldest surviving son. The reasons, stated\r\nbriefly, are: (1) that the first baptismal name of Joseph Buonaparte\r\nwas merely _Nabulione_ (Italian for _Napoleon_), and that _Joseph_ was\r\na later addition to his name on the baptismal register of January 7th,\r\n1768, at Corte; (2) certain statements that Joseph was born at\r\nAjaccio; (3) Napoleon's own statement at his marriage that he was born\r\nin 1768. To this it maybe replied that: (_a_) other letters and\r\nstatements, still more decisive, prove that Joseph was born at Corte\r\nin 1768 and Napoleon at Ajaccio in 1769; (_b_) Napoleon's entry in the\r\nmarriage register was obviously designed to lessen the disparity of\r\nyears of his bride, who, on her side, subtracted four years from her\r\nage. See Chuquet, \"La Jeunesse de Napoléon,\" p. 65.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Nasica, \"Mémoires,\" p. 192.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Both letters are accepted as authentic by Jung,\r\n\"Bonaparte et son Temps,\" vol. i., pp. 84, 92; but Masson, \"Napoléon\r\nInconnu,\" vol. i., p. 55, tracking them to their source, discredits\r\nthem, as also from internal evidence.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Chaptal, \"Mes Souvenirs sur Napoléon,\" p. 177.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Joseph Buonaparte, \"Mems.,\" vol. i., p. 29. So too Miot\r\nde Melito, \"Mems.,\" vol. i., ch. x.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Chaptal, \"Souvenirs sur Napoléon,\" p. 237. See too\r\nMasson, \"Napoléon Inconnu,\" vol. i., p. 158, note.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: In an after-dinner conversation on January 11th, 1803,\r\nwith Roederer, Buonaparte exalted Voltaire at the expense of Rousseau\r\nin these significant words: \"The more I read Voltaire, the more I like\r\nhim: he is always reasonable, never a charlatan, never a fanatic: he\r\nis made for mature minds. Up to sixteen years of age I would have\r\nfought for Rousseau against all the friends of Voltaire. Now it is the\r\ncontrary. _I have been especially disgusted with Rousseau since I\r\nhave seen the East. Savage man is a dog._\" (\"Oeuvres de Roederer,\"\r\nvol. iii., p. 461.)\r\n\r\nIn 1804 he even denied his indebtedness to Rousseau. During a family\r\ndiscussion, wherein he also belittled Corsica, he called Rousseau \"a\r\nbabbler, or, if you prefer it, an eloquent enough _idéalogue_. I never\r\nliked him, nor indeed well understood him: truly I had not the courage\r\nto read him all, because I thought him for the most part tedious.\"\r\n(Lucien Buonaparte, \"Mémoires,\" vol. ii., ch. xi.)\r\n\r\nHis later views on Rousseau are strikingly set forth by Stanislas\r\nGirardin, who, in his \"Memoirs,\" relates that Buonaparte, on his visit\r\nto the tomb of Rousseau, said: \"'It would have been better for the\r\nrepose of France that this man had never been born.' 'Why, First\r\nConsul?' said I. 'He prepared the French Revolution.' 'I thought it\r\nwas not for you to complain of the Revolution.' 'Well,' he replied,\r\n'the future will show whether it would not have been better for the\r\nrepose of the world that neither I nor Rousseau had existed.'\" Méneval\r\nconfirms this remarkable statement.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Masson, \"Napoléon Inconnu,\" vol. ii., p. 53.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Joseph Buonaparte, \"Mémoires,\" vol. i, p. 44.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: M. Chuquet, in his work \"La Jeunesse de Napoléon\"\r\n(Paris, 1898), gives a different opinion: but I think this passage\r\nshows a veiled hostility to Paoli. Probably we may refer to this time\r\nan incident stated by Napoleon at St. Helena to Lady Malcolm (\"Diary,\"\r\np. 88), namely, that Paoli urged on him the acceptance of a commission\r\nin the British army: \"But I preferred the French, because I spoke the\r\nlanguage, was of their religion, understood and liked their manners,\r\nand I thought the Revolution a fine time for an enterprising young\r\nman. Paoli was angry--we did not speak afterwards.\" It is hard to\r\nreconcile all these statements.\r\n\r\nLucien Buonaparte states that his brother seriously thought for a time\r\nof taking a commission in the forces of the British East India\r\nCompany; but I am assured by our officials that no record of any\r\napplication now exists.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: The whole essay is evidently influenced by the works of\r\nthe democrat Raynal, to whom Buonaparte dedicated his \"Lettres sur la\r\nCorse.\" To the \"Discours de Lyons\" he prefixed as motto the words\r\n\"Morality will exist when governments are free,\" which he modelled on\r\na similar phrase of Raynal. The following sentences are also\r\nnoteworthy: \"Notre organisation animale a des besoins indispensables:\r\nmanger, dormir, engendrer. Une nourriture, une cabane, des vêtements,\r\nune femme, sont donc une stricte nécessité pour le bonheur. Notre\r\norganisation intellectuelle a des appétits non moins impérieux et dont\r\nla satisfaction est beaucoup plus précieuse. C'est dans leur entier\r\ndéveloppement que consiste vraiment le bonheur. Sentir et raisonner,\r\nvoilà proprement le fait de l'homme.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Nasica; Chuquet, p. 248.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: His recantation of Jacobinism was so complete that some\r\npersons have doubted whether he ever sincerely held it. The doubt\r\nargues a singular _naïveté_ it is laid to rest by Buonaparte's own\r\nwritings, by his eagerness to disown or destroy them, by the testimony\r\nof everyone who knew his early career, and by his own confession:\r\n\"There have been good Jacobins.

Being\r\ncompelled to touch at the Ile de France for repairs to his ship, he\r\nwas there seized and detained as a spy by General Decaen, until the\r\nchivalrous intercession of the French explorer, Bougainville, finally\r\navailed to procure his release in the year 1810. The conduct of Decaen\r\nwas the more odious, as the French crews during their stay at Sydney\r\nin the autumn of 1802, when the news of the Peace of Amiens was as yet\r\nunknown, had received not only much help in the repair of their ships,\r\nbut most generous personal attentions, officials and private persons\r\nat Sydney agreeing to put themselves on short rations in that season\r\nof dearth in order that the explorers might have food. Though this\r\nfact was brought to Decaen's knowledge by the brother of Commodore\r\nBaudin, he none the less refused to acknowledge the validity of the\r\npassport which Flinders, as a geographical explorer, had received from\r\nthe French authorities, but detained him in captivity for seven years.\r\nFor the details see \"A Voyage of Discovery to the Australian Isles,\"\r\nby Captain Flinders (London, 1814), vol. ii., chs. vii.-ix.

The\r\nImperial Diet appointed a delegation to consider the whole question;\r\nbut before this body assembled (on August 24th, 1802), a number of\r\ntreaties had been secretly made at Paris, with the approval of Russia,\r\nwhich favoured Prussia and depressed Austria.

Réal received some order, the exact purport of which is\r\nunknown: it was late at night and he postponed going till the morrow.\r\nOn his way he met Savary, who came towards Paris bringing the news of\r\nthe duke's execution. Réal's first words, on hearing this unexpected\r\nnews, were: \"How is that possible? I had so many questions to put to\r\nthe duke: his examination might disclose so much. Another thing gone\r\nwrong; the First Consul will be furious.\" These words were afterwards\r\nrepeated to Pasquier both by Savary and by Real: and, unless Pasquier\r\nlied, the belated order sent to Réal was not a pardon (and Napoleon on\r\nhis last voyage said to Cockburn it was not), but merely an order to\r\nextract such information from the duke as would compromise other\r\nFrenchmen. Besides, if Napoleon had despatched an order for the duke's\r\n_pardon_, why was not that order produced as a sign of his innocence\r\nand Réal's blundering? Why did he shut himself up in his private room\r\non March 20th, so that even Josephine had difficulty in gaining\r\nentrance? And if he really desired to pardon the duke, how came it\r\nthat when, at noon of March 21st, Réal explained that he arrived at\r\nVincennes too late, the only words that escaped Napoleon's lips were\r\n\"C'est bien\"? (See Méneval, vol. i, p. 296.) Why also was his\r\ncountenance the only one that afterwards showed no remorse or grief?\r\nCaulaincourt, when he heard the results of his raid into Baden,\r\nfainted with horror, and when brought to by Bonaparte, overwhelmed him\r\nwith reproaches. Why also had the grave been dug beforehand? Why,\r\nfinally, were Savary and Réal not disgraced? No satisfactory answer to\r\nthese questions has ever been given. The \"Catastrophe du duc\r\nd'Enghien\" and Count Boulay de la Meurthe's \"Les dernières Années du\r\nduc d'Enghien\" and Napoleon's \"Correspondance\" give all the documents\r\nneeded for forming a judgment on this case.

It was further known that the Austrian Government had proposed\r\nto the Czar plans that were hostile to Turkey, and were not decisively\r\nrejected at St. Petersburg; and it is clear from the notes left by\r\nCzartoryski that the prospect of gaining Corfu, Moldavia, parts of\r\nAlbania, and the precious prize of Constantinople was kept in view.\r\nPitt agreed to restore the conquests made from France (Despatch of\r\nApril 22nd).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Garden, \"Traités,\" vol. viii., pp. 328-333.

Knesebeck declared that his mission early in 1812 to the\r\nCzar, which was to persuade him to a peaceful compromise with\r\nNapoleon, was directly controverted by the secret instructions which\r\nhe bore from Frederick William to Alexander. He described several\r\nmidnight interviews with the Czar at the Winter Palace, in which he\r\nconvinced him that by war with Napoleon, and by enticing him into the\r\nheart of Russia, Europe would be saved. Lehmann has shown (\"Knesebeck\r\nund Schön\") that this story is contradicted by all the documentary\r\nevidence. It may be dismissed as the offspring of senile vanity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 259: \"Toll,\" vol. i., pp. 256 _et seq._ Müffling was assured\r\nby Phull in 1819 that the Drissa plan was only part of a grander\r\ndesign which had never had a fair[*Scanner's note: fair is correct]\r\nchance!]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 260: Bernhardi's \"Toll\" (vol. i., p. 231) gives Barclay's\r\nchief \"army of the west\" as really mustering only 127,000 strong,\r\nalong with 9,000 Cossacks; Bagration, with the second \"army of the\r\nwest,\" numbered at first only 35,000, with 4,000 Cossacks; while\r\nTormasov's corps observing Galicia was about as strong.

On July 9th he wrote at Vilna that he\r\nproposed to march _both on Moscow and St. Petersburg_. But that was\r\nwhile he still hoped that Davoust would entrap Bagration, and while\r\nBarclay's retreat on Drissa seemed likely to carry the war into the\r\nnorth. Napoleon always aimed first at the enemy's army; and Barclay's\r\nretreat from Drissa to Vitepsk, and thence to Smolensk, finally\r\ndecided Napoleon's move towards Moscow. If he had any preconceived\r\nscheme--and he always regulated his moves by events rather than by a\r\ncast-iron plan--it was to strike at Moscow. At Dresden he said to De\r\nPradt: \"I must finish the war by the end of September.... I am going\r\nto Moscow: one or two battles will settle the business. I will burn\r\nTula, and Russia will be at my feet. Moscow is the heart of that\r\nEmpire. I will wage war with Polish blood.\" De Pradt's evidence is not\r\nwholly to be trusted; but I am convinced that Napoleon never seriously\r\nthought of taking 200,000 men to the barren tracts of North Russia\r\nlate in the summer, while the English, Swedish, and Russian fleets\r\nwere ready to worry his flank and stop supplies.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 265: Letter of August 24th to Maret; so too Labaume's\r\n\"Narrative,\" and Garden, vol. xiii., p. 418.

The statement will not bear\r\nexamination. Sharp cold usually sets in before November 6th in Russia\r\nat latitude 55°; the severe weather which he then suffered was\r\nsucceeded by alternate thaws and slighter frosts until the beginning\r\nof December, when intense cold is always expected. Moreover, the bulk\r\nof the losses occurred before the first snowstorm. The Grand Army\r\nwhich marched on Smolensk and Moscow may be estimated at 400,000\r\n(including reinforcements). At Viasma, _before severe cold set in_, it\r\nhad dwindled to 55,000. We may note here the curious fact,\r\nsubstantiated by Alison, that the French troops stood the cold better\r\nthan the Poles and North Germans. See too N. Senior's \"Conversations,\"\r\nvol. i., p. 239.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 275: Bausset, \"Cour de Napoléon\"; Wilson, pp. 271-277.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 276: Oudinot, \"Mémoires.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 277: Hereford George, pp. 349-350.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 278: Bourgogne, ch. viii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 279: Pasquier, vol. ii., _ad init._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 280: Colonel Desprez, who accompanied the retreat, thus\r\ndescribed to King Joseph its closing scenes: \"The truth is best\r\nexpressed by saying that _the army is dead_.

The\r\ncorps of Victor and Oudinot numbered 30,000 men when they crossed the\r\nBeresina: two days afterwards they had melted away like the rest of\r\nthe army.

If, however,\r\nthe Powers most immediately concerned should determine, rather than\r\nencounter the risks of a more protracted struggle, to trust for their\r\nown security to a more imperfect arrangement, it never has been the\r\npolicy of the British Government to attempt to dictate to other States\r\na perseverance in war, which they did not themselves recognize to be\r\nessential to their own as well as to the common safety.\" As regards\r\ndetails, we desired to see the restoration of Venetia to Austria, of\r\nthe Papal States to the Pope, of the north-west of Italy to the King\r\nof Sardinia, but trusted that \"a liberal establishment\" might be found\r\nfor Murat in the centre of Italy.

Captain\r\nBogue brought it forward to check the charge of a French column\r\nagainst the Swedes. He was shot down, but Lieutenant Strangways poured\r\nin so hot a fire that the column was \"blown asunder like an ant-heap,\"\r\nthe men rushing back to cover amidst the loud laughter of the allies.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 383: The premature explosion was of course due, not to\r\nNapoleon, but to the flurry of a serjeant and the skilful flanking\r\nmove of Sacken's light troops, for which see Cathcart and Marmont. The\r\nlosses at Leipzig were rendered heavier by Napoleon's humane refusal\r\nto set fire to the suburbs so as to keep off the allies. He rightly\r\nsaid he could have saved many thousand French had he done so. This is\r\ntrue. But it is strange that he had given no order for the\r\nconstruction of other bridges. Pelet and Fain affirm that he gave a\r\nverbal order; but, as Marbot explains, Berthier, the Chief of the\r\nStaff, had adopted the pedantic custom of never acting on anything\r\nless than _a written order_, which was not given. The neglect to\r\nsecure means for retreat is all the stranger as the final miseries at\r\nthe Beresina were largely due to official blundering of the same kind.\r\nWellington's criticism on Napoleon's tactics at Leipzig is severe\r\n(despatch of January 10th, 1814): \"If Bonaparte had not placed himself\r\nin a position that every other officer would have avoided, and\r\nremained in it longer than was consistent with any ideas of prudence,\r\nhe would have retired in such a state that the allies could not have\r\nventured to approach the Rhine.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 384: Sir Charles Stewart wrote (March 22nd, 1814): \"On the\r\nElbe Napoleon was quite insane, and his lengthened stay there was the\r\ncause of the Battle of Leipzig and all his subsequent misfortunes\"\r\n(\"Castlereagh Papers,\" vol. ix., p. 373).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 385: Napier, vol. v., pp. 368-378.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 386: On November 10th Lord Aberdeen, our ambassador at the\r\nAustrian Court, wrote to Castlereagh: \" ... As soon as he [Murat]\r\nreceived the last communication addressed to him by Prince Metternich\r\nand myself at Prague, he wrote to Napoleon and stated that the affairs\r\nof his kingdom absolutely demanded his presence. Without waiting for\r\nany answer, he immediately began his journey, and did not halt a\r\nmoment till he arrived at Basle. While on the road he sent a cyphered\r\ndispatch to Prince Cariati, his Minister at Vienna, in which he\r\ninforms him that he hopes to be at Naples on the 4th of this month:\r\nthat he burns with desire to revenge himself of [_sic_] all the\r\ninjuries he has received from Bonaparte, and to connect himself with\r\nthe cause of the allies in contending for a just and stable peace. He\r\nproposes to declare war on the instant of his arrival.\" Again, on\r\nDecember 19th, Aberdeen writes: \"You may consider the affair of Murat\r\nas settled.... It will probably end in Austria agreeing to his having\r\na change of frontier on the Papal territory, just enough to satisfy\r\nhis vanity and enable him to show something to his people. I doubt\r\nmuch if it will be possible, with the claims of Sicily, Sardinia, and\r\nAustria herself in the north of Italy, to restore to him the three\r\nLegations: but something adequate must be done\" (\"Austria,\" No. 102).\r\nThe disputes between Murat and Napoleon will be cleared up in Baron\r\nLumbroso's forthcoming work, \"Murat.\" Meanwhile see Bignon, vol.\r\nxiii., pp. 181 _et seq._; Desvernois, \"Mems.,\" ch. xx.; and Chaptal\r\n(p. 305), for Fouché's treacherous advice to Murat.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 387: Lady Burghersh's \"Journal,\" p. 182.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 388: Fain, \"Manuscrit de 1814,\" pp. 48-63.

His whole eastward move was motived by them.\r\nEfforts have been made (_e.g._, by M. de Bacourt in Talleyrand's\r\n\"Mems.,\" pt. vii., app. 4) to prove that on the 25th Napoleon was\r\nready to agree to all the allied terms, and thus concede more than was\r\ndone by Louis XVIII. But there is no proof that he meant to do\r\nanything of the sort. The terms of Caulaincourt's note were perfectly\r\nvague. Moreover, even on the 28th, when Napoleon was getting alarmed,\r\nhe had an interview with a captured Austrian diplomatist, Wessenberg,\r\nwhom he set free in order that he might confer with the Emperor\r\nFrancis. He told the envoy that France would yet give him support: he\r\nwanted the natural frontiers, but would probably make peace on less\r\nfavourable terms, as he wished to end the war: \"I am ready to renounce\r\nall the French colonies if I can thereby keep the mouth of the Scheldt\r\nfor France. England will not insist on my sacrificing Antwerp if\r\nAustria does not support her\" (Arneth's \"Wessenberg,\" vol. i., p.\r\n188). This extract shows no great desire to meet the allied terms, but\r\nrather to separate Austria from her allies. According to Lady\r\nBurghersh (\"Journals,\" p. 216), Napoleon admitted to Wessenberg that\r\nhis position was desperate. I think this was a pleasing fiction of\r\nthat envoy. There is no proof that Napoleon was wholly cast down till\r\nthe 29th, when he heard of La Fère Champenoise (Macdonald's\r\n\"Souvenirs\").]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 441: Bignon, vol. xiii., pp. 436, 437.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 442: On hearing of their withdrawal Stein was radiant with\r\njoy: \"Now, he said, the Czar will go on to Paris, and all will soon be\r\nat an end\" (Tourgueneff quoted by Häusser, vol. iv., p. 553).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 443: Bernhardi's \"Toll,\" vol. iv., pp. 737 _et seq._;\r\nHoussaye, pp. 354-362; also Nesselrode's communication published in\r\nTalleyrand's \"Mems.\" Thielen and Radetzky have claimed that the\r\ninitiative in this matter was Schwarzenberg's; and Lord Burghersh, in\r\nhis despatch of March 25th (\"Austria,\" No. 110), agrees with them.\r\nStein supports Toll's claim. I cannot agree with Houssaye (p. 407)\r\nthat \"Napoleon had resigned himself to the sacrifice of Paris.\" His\r\nintercepted letter, and also the official letters, Nos. 21508, 21513,\r\n21516, 21526, 21538, show that he believed the allies would retreat\r\nand that his communications with Paris would be safe.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 444: I take this account largely from Sir Hudson Lowe's\r\nunpublished memoirs. Napoleon blamed Marmont for not marching to\r\nRheims as he was ordered to do.

The story that\r\nWellington rode over to Wavre on the night of the 18th on his horse\r\n\"Copenhagen\" is of course a myth.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 506: \"Blackwood's Magazine,\" October, 1896; \"Cornhill,\"\r\nJanuary, 1901.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 507: Beamish's \"King's German Legion,\" vol. ii., p. 352.

Sir Hudson Lowe then suggested that it should be\r\nfortified: \"Query, in respect to the construction of a work at Mt.\r\nJean, being the commanding point at the junction of two principal\r\nchaussées\" (\"Unpublished Memoirs\").]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 508: Wellington has been censured by Clausewitz, Kennedy and\r\nChesney for leaving so large a force at Hal. Perhaps he desired to\r\nprotect the King of France at Ghent, though he was surely relieved of\r\nresponsibility by his despatch of June 18th, 3 a.m., begging the Duc\r\nde Berri to retire with the King to Antwerp. It seems to me more\r\nlikely that he was so confident of an early advance of the Prussians\r\n(see his other despatch of the same hour and Sir A. Frazer's\r\nstatement--\"Letters,\" p. 553--\"We expected the Prussian co-operation\r\nearly in the day\") as to assume that Napoleon would stake all on an\r\neffort against his right; and in that case the Hal force would have\r\ncrushed the French rear, though it was very far off.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 509: Wellington to Earl Bathurst, June 25th, 1815. The Earl\r\nof Ellesmere, who wrote under the Duke's influence, stated that not\r\nmore than 7,000 of the British troops had seen a shot fired. This is\r\nincorrect. Picton's division, still 5,000 strong, was almost wholly\r\ncomposed of tried troops; and Lambert's brigade counted 2,200\r\nveterans; many of the Guards had seen fire, and the 52nd was a\r\nseasoned regiment. Tomkinson (p. 296) reckons all the 5,220 British\r\nand 1,730 King's German troopers as \"efficient,\" and Wellington\r\nhimself, so Mercer affirms, told Blücher he had 6,000 of the finest\r\ncavalry in the world.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 510: \"A British Rifleman,\" p. 367.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 511: I distrust the story told by Zenowicz, and given by\r\nThiers, that Napoleon at 10 a.m. was awaiting Grouchy with impatience;\r\nalso Marbot's letter referred to in his \"Memoirs,\" _ad fin._, in which\r\nhe says the Emperor bade him push on boldly towards Wavre, as the\r\ntroops near St. Lambert \"could be nothing else than the corps of\r\nGrouchy.\" Grouchy's despatch and the official reply show that Napoleon\r\nknew Grouchy to be somewhere between Gembloux and Wavre. Besides,\r\nBülow's report (Ollech, p. 192) states that, while at St. Lambert, he\r\nsent out two strong patrols to the S.W., and was not observed by the\r\nFrench, \"who appeared to have no idea of our existence.\" This\r\ncompletely disposes of Marbot's story.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 512: Houssaye, ch. vii.

Thiers omits all notice of the second\r\ncolumn; Houssaye limits its force to a single battalion, but his\r\naccount is not convincing. On p. 385 he says nine battalions of the\r\nGuard advanced into the valley, but, on p. 389, he accounts only for\r\nsix. Other authorities agree that eight joined in the attack. As to\r\ntheir formation, Houssaye advances many proofs that it was in hollow\r\nsquares. Here is one more. On the 19th Basil Jackson rode along the\r\nslope and ridge near the back of Hougoumont and talked with some of\r\nthe wounded of the Imperial Guard. \"As they lay they formed large\r\nsquares, of which the centres were hollow\" (p. 57). Maitland\r\n(\"Waterloo Letters,\" p. 244.) says: \"There was one great column at\r\nfirst, which separated into two parts.\" Gawler (p. 292) adds that:\r\n\"The second column was subdivided in two parts, close together, and\r\nthat _its whole flank was much longer than the front of our 52nd\r\nregiment_.\" It is difficult to reconcile all this with the attack in\r\nhollow squares; but probably the squares (or oblongs?) followed each\r\nother so closely as to seem like a serried column. None of our men\r\ncould see whether the masses were solid or hollow, but naturally\r\nassumed them to be solid, and hence greatly over-estimated their\r\nstrength. A column made up of hollow squares is certainly an odd\r\nformation, but perhaps is not unsuitable to withstand cavalry and\r\noverthrow infantry.\r\n\r\nI cannot accept Houssaye's statement (p. 393) that the French squares\r\nattacked our front at four different places, from the 52nd regiment on\r\nour right to the Brunswickers in our centre, a quarter of a mile to\r\nthe east. The only evidence that favours this is Macready's (\"Waterloo\r\nLetters,\" p. 330); he says that the men who attacked his square (30th\r\nand 73rd regiments) were of the Middle Guard; for their wounded said\r\nso; but Kelly, of the same square, thought they were Donzelot's men,\r\nwho certainly attacked there. Siborne, seemingly on the strength of\r\nMacready's statement, says that part of the Guards' column diverged\r\nthither: but this is unlikely. Is it credible that the Guards, less\r\nthan 4,000 strong, should have spread their attacks over a quarter of\r\na mile of front? Was not the column the usual method of attack? I\r\nsubmit, then, that my explanation of the Guard attacking in hollow\r\noblongs, formed in two chief columns, harmonizes the known facts. See\r\nPetit's \"Relation\" in \"Eng. Hist. Rev.,\" April, 1903.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 524: Janin, p. 45.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 525: Bertrand at St. Helena said he _heard_ Michel utter\r\nthese words (Montholon, vol. iii., ch. iv.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 526: Maitland's \"Narrative,\" p. 222.

In our records is a letter of Montholon to his\r\nwife of May 6th, 1821, which admits the contrary: \"C'est dans notre\r\nmalheur une grande consolation pour nous d'avoir acquis la preuve que\r\nsa mort n'est, et n'a pu être, en aucune manière le résultat de sa\r\ncaptivité.\" Yet, on his return to Europe, Montholon stoutly maintained\r\nthat the liver complaint endemic to St. Helena had been the death of\r\nhis master.
