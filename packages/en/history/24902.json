D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an early number of the _International_ we had the satisfaction of\r\nprinting an original and very interesting letter from Dr. Layard, in\r\nwhich, with more fulness and explicitness than in his great work on\r\nNineveh, he discusses the subject of Ancient Art. We have carefully\r\nnoted from time to time his proceedings in the East, and our readers\r\nwill remember that we recently gave engravings of the most remarkable of\r\nthe antiquities he sent home last year to the British Museum. Since that\r\ntime he has proceeded to Bagdad, and he is now pursuing in that\r\nvicinity, with his wonted sagacity and earnestness, researches for the\r\nremains of Babylon, which in turn will furnish material for another\r\nextensive publication from his pen.\r\n\r\nThe first public announcement of the discoveries at Nimroud was made in\r\nthe _Knickerbocker Magazine_ of this city, in a letter from our\r\ncountryman, Minor K. Kellogg, the painter, who was a long time the\r\nintimate friend and travelling companion of Layard in Asia Minor.\r\nIntroducing the letters in which the antiquary disclosed the successful\r\nresult of his investigations, Mr. Kellogg says:\r\n\r\n     \"I can scarcely call to mind a person so admirably qualified in\r\n     all respects for prosecuting such laborious researches. He is\r\n     young, of a hardy and enduring constitution, is acquainted with\r\n     the Oriental languages, and speaks the Persian and Turkish\r\n     fluently. He is enthusiastic and indefatigable in every thing\r\n     he undertakes, and plentifully endowed with courage, prudence,\r\n     and good-nature.\"\r\n\r\nThis was more than two years before Layard himself, in his \"Nineveh and\r\nits Remains,\" exhibited those triumphs of his intelligence and devotion\r\nwhich have secured for him a place among the most famous travellers and\r\nantiquaries in the world.\r\n\r\nWe take the occasion of copying the above portrait from the last number\r\nof _Bentley's Miscellany_ to present, from various authentic sources, a\r\nbrief sketch of Dr. Layard's history. He is descended from the noble\r\nFrench Protestant family of Raymond de Layarde, who accompanied the\r\nPrince of Orange into England. He was born at Paris, during a temporary\r\nvisit of his parents to that metropolis, on the 5th of March, 1817. His\r\nfather, who was the son of the Rev. Dr. Henry Peter John Layard, Dean of\r\nBristol, filled a high civil office in Ceylon, between the years 1820\r\nand 1830, and took great interest in the circulation of the Scriptures\r\namong heathen nations. He was a man of considerable classical learning,\r\nand of refined tastes. During the youth of his son, he lived at\r\nFlorence, where our young antiquary had free access to the stores of the\r\nPitti Palace, and of the Tribune. He thus became familiar from his\r\ninfancy with the language of Tuscany, and formed his taste for the fine\r\narts and literature upon the models of painting and sculpture amid which\r\nhe lived, and in the rich libraries which he frequented. In this manner\r\nhe added a thorough knowledge of modern languages to a competent\r\nacquaintance with those of Greece and Rome. Here, also, he acquired,\r\nalmost involuntarily, a power over his pencil, which, long dormant, was\r\ncalled forth by the sight of slabs with the noblest sculptures and the\r\nfinest inscriptions, crumbling into dust. No draughtsman had been\r\nprovided for his assistance, and had he not instantly determined to\r\narrest by the quickness of his eye, and the skill thus acquired,\r\nimproved subsequently by Mr. Kellogg's companionship, those fleeting\r\nforms which were about to disappear for ever, many of the finest remains\r\nof ancient art would have been irrecoverably lost.\r\n\r\nOn his return from Italy to England, he was urged to choose the\r\nprofession of the law; but his thirst for knowledge, his love of\r\nadventure, and his foreign tastes and habits, led him, after a brief\r\napprenticeship, to travel. He left England, with no very definite\r\nobject, in the summer of 1839, and, accompanied by a friend, visited\r\nRussia and other northern countries, and afterward, living some time in\r\nGermany and the states on the Danube, made himself master of the German\r\nlanguage, and of several of the dialects of Transylvania. From Dalmatia\r\nhe passed into Montenegro, where he remained a considerable time,\r\nassisting an able and active young chief in ameliorating the condition\r\nof his semi-barbarous subjects. Travelling through Albania and Romelia,\r\nwhere he met with numerous adventures, he arrived at Constantinople,\r\nabout the end of 1839. Here he made arrangements for visiting Asia\r\nMinor, and other countries in the East, where he spent some years,\r\nadopting the costume and leading the life of an Arab of the Desert, and\r\nacquiring a thorough knowledge of the manners and languages of Turkey\r\nand Arabia. In 1840 or 1841, he transmitted to the Royal Geographical\r\nSociety, an Itinerary from Constantinople to Aleppo, which does not seem\r\nto have been published; but in the eleventh volume of the Journal of\r\nthat Society, we have an account of the tour which he performed with Mr.\r\nAinsworth, in April, 1840. He travelled in Persia in the same year, and\r\nprojected a journey for the purpose of examining Susa, and some other\r\nplaces of interest in the Baktyari mountains, to which Major Rawlinson\r\nhad drawn the attention of the Geographical Society. With this view, he\r\nleft Ispahan in the middle of September, in company with Schiffeer Khan,\r\na Baktyari chief; and having crossed the highest part of the great chain\r\nof Mungasht, he visited the ruins of Manjanik, which are of considerable\r\nextent, and resemble those of the Susannian cities. He visited also the\r\nruins in the plain of Mel Amir, and copied some of their cuneiform\r\ninscriptions. In crossing the hills to Susan, he was attacked by a tribe\r\nof Dinarunis, and robbed of his watch, compass, &c.; but having\r\ncomplained to the chief, and insisted on the return of every missing\r\narticle, he received back the whole of his property. It had been his\r\npractice to traverse these mountains quite alone, and he was never\r\nattacked or insulted, except on this occasion, when the country was in a\r\nstate of war. He found scarcely any remains at Susan to indicate the\r\nsite of a large city. In 1842 and 1843, he spent a considerable time in\r\nthe province of Khuistan, an elaborate description of which he\r\ncommunicated through Lord Aberdeen to the Royal Geographical Society. It\r\nwas during these various journeys that he prepared himself for the great\r\ntask to which his best and ripest powers were to be devoted. In his\r\nwanderings through Asia Minor and Syria he had scarcely left a spot\r\nuntrodden which tradition hallowed, or a ruin unexamined which was\r\nconsecrated by history. His companion shared his feelings and his zeal.\r\nUnmindful of danger, they rode along with no other protection than their\r\narms. They tended their own horses, and, mixing with the people, they\r\nacquired their manners and their language. He himself says: \"I had\r\ntraversed Asia Minor and Syria, visiting the ancient seats of\r\ncivilization, and the spots which religion had made holy. I now felt an\r\nirresistible desire to penetrate to the regions beyond the Euphrates, to\r\nwhich history and tradition point as the birthplace of the Wisdom of the\r\nWest.\"\r\n\r\nWith these feelings, he looked to the banks of the Tigris, and longed to\r\ndispel the mysterious darkness which hung over Assyria and Babylonia.\r\nHe, accordingly, made preliminary visits to Mosul, inspected the ruins\r\nof Nimroud and Kuyunjik, and, fortunately, obtained an interview with\r\nSir Stratford Canning at Constantinople, then on his way to England.\r\nThis distinguished man, who was formerly minister to the United States,\r\nand is remembered with well-deserved gratitude by nearly every recent\r\ntraveller in the East, immediately discovered and appreciated the\r\ncharacter and talents of Mr. Layard. His knowledge of the East, and of\r\nits manners and languages, recommended him in a peculiar manner to the\r\nnotice of the ambassador, who persuaded him to remain, and employed him\r\non many important public services. Sir Stratford Canning himself took a\r\ndeep interest in the researches which had been made by the French, and\r\nhe promptly aided his young countryman in carrying out the designs of\r\nwhich we now have the histories in his books. In the summer of 1845 Mr.\r\nLayard, Count Perpontier of the Prussian Embassy, and Mr. Kellogg,\r\nquitted Constantinople together, and visited Brusa (where Layard was\r\nsome time dangerously ill from a _coup de soleil_), Mount Olympus, the\r\ncountry of the Ourouks or Wandering Tartars, the valley of the\r\nRhyndacus, the Plain of Toushanloo, Kiutayah, the ruins of Azani, &c.\r\nShortly after he proceeded to Nimroud, and in December, 1847, he\r\nreturned to England with the fruits of his labors. He wrote to Mr.\r\nKellogg, who was now in New-York, under date of\r\n\r\n    \"CHELTENHAM, Jan. 16, 1848.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR KELLOGG:--I was quite delighted to see your\r\n     handwriting again, when a few days ago I received your letter\r\n     of the 15th November, with the diploma of the New-York\r\n     Ethnological Society. I reached home on Christmas day, after\r\n     having been detained three months at Constantinople. As you may\r\n     well conceive, since my return I have not had a moment to\r\n     myself--for what with domestic rejoicings and general honors, I\r\n     have been in one continual movement and excitement. I was\r\n     gratified to find that the results of my labors had created\r\n     much more interest in England than I could possibly have\r\n     expected, and that those connected with art, and interested in\r\n     early history, were really enthusiastic on the subject; so much\r\n     so, indeed, that the Trustees of the British Museum are\r\n     desirous of doing every thing that I think right; and it is\r\n     probable that ere long a very fine work will be published at\r\n     the public expense, containing all the drawings (about 130) and\r\n     inscriptions. I am to write and publish a small descriptive and\r\n     popular work, for my own advantage, just sufficient to satisfy\r\n     the public curiosity about Nineveh and the excavations. It will\r\n     contain an account of the works carried on, a slight sketch of\r\n     the history of Nineveh, a short inquiry into the manners,\r\n     customs and religion of the Assyrians, my own adventures in\r\n     Assyria, and a little information on the language and\r\n     character, with an account of the progress made in deciphering.\r\n     There will be two volumes I presume, and I have already\r\n     advantageous offers from publishers. My reason for entering\r\n     into these details, is to ask you what the law is in America,\r\n     and whether any influential bookseller would be willing to give\r\n     me any thing for the copyright, and if so, how it could be\r\n     managed? If you could do any thing for me in this matter, I\r\n     should really be much obliged to you, and I am willing to abide\r\n     by any arrangement you might think advantageous. I think the\r\n     work will be attractive--particularly in America, where there\r\n     are so many Scripture readers.\r\n\r\n     \"I took Florence on my way, expressly to see you and Powers.\r\n     Although I was disappointed (and very greatly too) in the\r\n     first, I was greatly gratified in seeing Powers, and can assure\r\n     you I left Florence with as high an admiration for his genius\r\n     and character, as you can have, although unfortunately I was\r\n     only able to pass an hour or two with him, my stay being so\r\n     short. I showed him all my drawings, and, as you may suppose,\r\n     passed a very pleasant morning with him, Kirkup, and\r\n     Migliarini--all enthusiastic in seeing my drawings, and persons\r\n     worth showing such things to. Two hours, spent in this way, go\r\n     far towards recompensing one for any labor and sacrifice. I got\r\n     your address from Powers, intending to write to you as soon as\r\n     I reached England. It gave me the sincerest pleasure to hear\r\n     every one uniting in your praise; I regretted the more that you\r\n     were absent, and that I was unable to see your works. I was\r\n     delighted to find that such brilliant prospects were opening to\r\n     Powers, and I learnt from him, what you hint at in your letter,\r\n     that you also were prospering, and that substantial advantages\r\n     were pretty sure. I have only now to get a little money in my\r\n     pocket, and then inshallah (as the Turks say), I'll have my\r\n     picture out of you. To return to business for a moment (pardon\r\n     me for doing so), I think the drawings will be published in\r\n     first rate style and at a very moderate price: about L10--not a\r\n     shilling a drawing. Pray mention this to any of your bookseller\r\n     friends, and perhaps they may be induced to take a few copies.\r\n     It will be a work which no library ought to be without; it\r\n     will, I hope, quite surpass the French publication both in\r\n     execution and subject, and will be sold at one-tenth of the\r\n     price--theirs coming to nearly L100. I inclose a letter of\r\n     thanks for the Secretary of the Ethnological Society, which\r\n     pray send, and also add on my part, many thanks for this honor,\r\n     which I can assure you I particularly appreciate. My names are\r\n     Austen Henry Layard, and my designation simply \"attached to Her\r\n     Britannic Majesty's Embassy, at the Sublime Porte.\" Lady\r\n     Canning and her family are still in England, Sir Stratford at\r\n     Berne. It is doubtful when they will return to Constantinople,\r\n     but I presume ere long. I am ordered out in May, and am named\r\n     commissioner for the settlement of the boundaries between\r\n     Turkey and Persia. I wish I had you with me during my\r\n     commission, for I shall visit a most interesting country,\r\n     totally unknown, and with magnificent subjects for such a\r\n     pencil as yours. I am sorry I did not know of your visit to\r\n     England. I have many influential friends, who would have been\r\n     glad to welcome you, and who might have been useful. I am now\r\n     passing a month or two at Cheltenham, for the benefit of my\r\n     health, which has suffered a little. I will write to you again\r\n     soon with something more interesting. Believe me, my dear\r\n     Kellogg, yours ever sincerely,\r\n\r\n     A. H. LAYARD.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the publication of his great work on Nineveh and its Remains, thus\r\nmodestly announced, and his One Hundred Plates, he went back to the\r\nEast, to renew his researches. Of the results of his recent labors we\r\nhave already written, in the _International_ for December.\r\n\r\nDr. Layard is a person of the most amiable and pleasing character, with\r\nall the social virtues which command affection and respect, and such\r\ncapacities in literature as make him one of the most attractive\r\ntravel-writers in our language. The world may yet look for several\r\nvolumes from his hand, upon the East, and we are sure they will deserve\r\nthe large and permanent popularity to which his first work has attained\r\nin every country where it has been printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASTOR LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe present above an accurate view of the exterior of the ASTOR LIBRARY,\r\nin Lafayette Place, from a drawing made for the _International_ under\r\nthe direction of the architect, Mr. Alexander Saeltzer. It is destined\r\nto be one of the chief attractions of the city, and information\r\nrespecting it will be read with interest by the literary and learned\r\nthroughout the country.\r\n\r\nIt is now three years since John Jacob Astor died, leaving by his will\r\nfour hundred thousand dollars for the establishment of a Public Library\r\nin New-York, and naming as the first trustees, the Mayor of the city of\r\nNew-York and the Chancellor of the state for the time being. Washington\r\nIrving, William B. Astor, Daniel Lord, Jr., James G. King, Joseph G.\r\nCogswell, Fitz-Greene Halleck, Henry Brevoort, Jr., Samuel B. Ruggles,\r\nSamuel Ward, and Charles Bristed. On the twentieth of May the trustees\r\nheld their first meeting, accepted the trust conferred on them, and\r\nappointed Dr. Cogswell, one of their number, superintendent of the\r\nLibrary. Of the bequest, $75,000 was authorized to be applied to the\r\nerection of a building, $120,000 to the purchase of books and other\r\nobjects in the establishment of the Library, and the residue, after\r\npaying for the site, was to be invested as a fund for its maintenance\r\nand increase. In September, 1848, the trustees selected the site for the\r\nedifice. It is convenient for all public purposes, and affords the\r\ncomparative quietude and retirement which are desirable for an\r\ninstitution of constant resort for study and for the consultation of\r\nauthorities. In October, Dr. Cogswell was authorized to go to Europe and\r\npurchase at his discretion books to the value of twenty thousand\r\ndollars. The object of the trustees in sending him abroad at that\r\nparticular time was to avail themselves of the opportunity, afforded by\r\nthe distracted political condition of Europe and the reduction of prices\r\nconsequent upon it, to purchase books at very low rates; and the\r\npurchases were made at prices greatly below the ordinary standard, and\r\nthe execution of his trust in all respects amply vindicated the high\r\nopinion entertained of Dr. Cogswell's fitness for his position.\r\n\r\nThe plans for the edifice submitted by Mr. Saeltzer having been adopted,\r\nthe work was commenced and has been vigorously prosecuted until the\r\npresent time, when the front and nearly all the exterior are completed.\r\nThe Library is of brown stone, and in the Byzantine style, or rather in\r\nthat of the palaces of Florence, and is one hundred and twenty feet\r\nlong, sixty-five feet wide, and sixty-seven feet high. Scarcely a\r\nparticle of wood enters into its composition. No building in the United\r\nStates, of this character, is formed to so large an extent of iron. Its\r\nuses, too, are altogether novel, at least in this country, and\r\ningenious. For instance, the truss beams, supporting the principal\r\nweight of the roof, are constructed of cast iron pipes, in a parabolic\r\nform, on the same plan as the iron bridges in France and other parts of\r\nEurope, with a view to secure lightness and strength. The Library Hall,\r\nwhich occupies the second floor, is one hundred feet high, and sixty\r\nwide, in the clear. The ascent from the front is by a single line of\r\nthirty-eight Italian marble steps, decorated on either side, at the\r\nentrance, by a stone sphinx. Upon nearing the summit of these steps, the\r\nvisitor finds himself near the centre of this immense alcove, surrounded\r\nby fourteen brick piers, plastered and finished in imitation of marble,\r\nand supporting iron galleries, midway between the floor and the ceiling.\r\nThe side walls form one continuous shelving, of a capacity sufficient\r\nfor 100,000 volumes. This is reached by means of the main gallery, in\r\nconnection with which are four iron spiral stairways and an intervening\r\ngallery, of a lighter and smaller description, connected by its eight\r\nstaircases with the main gallery. The whole are very ingeniously\r\narranged and appropriately ornamented, in a style corresponding with the\r\ngeneral architecture of the building. At an elevation of fifty-one feet\r\nabove the floor of the main hall, is the principal skylight, fifty-four\r\nfeet long and fourteen broad, formed of thick glass set in iron. Besides\r\nthis there are circular side skylights of much smaller dimensions. All\r\nneedful light is furnished, by these and by the windows in the front and\r\nrear walls. Free ventilation is also secured by iron fretwork, in\r\nsuitable portions of the ceiling. In the extreme rear are the two rooms\r\nfor the librarian, to which access is had by means of the main\r\ngalleries.\r\n\r\nThe first floor contains lecture and reading-rooms, with accommodations\r\nfor five hundred persons. The latter are on each side of the building,\r\nand separated from the library-hall stairway at the front entrance by\r\ntwo corridors leading to the rear vestibule, and thence to the\r\nlecture-room, still further in the rear. The basement contains the\r\nkeeper's rooms, cellars, coal-vaults, air-furnaces, &c. The floors are\r\nof richly-wrought mosaic work, on iron beams. The building will not be\r\ncompleted, probably, for nearly a year from this time, and the books\r\ncollected, about 27,000, are meanwhile accessible at 32 Bond-street.\r\n\r\nDr. Cogswell has had printed, in an octavo volume of 446 pages, an\r\nalphabetical index to the books now collected, and of the proposed\r\naccessions. This catalogue is not published, and there are but few\r\ncopies of it. The learned librarian, who sailed a few days ago on a new\r\nmission for the library, to Europe, printed it at his own cost,\r\nconvinced that without some such manual it would be extremely difficult,\r\nif not impossible, in making the necessary purchases, to avoid buying\r\nduplicates, and equally difficult to select judiciously so many thousand\r\nvolumes as are required. He remarks that the Astor Library is in his\r\nopinion the first of so considerable an extent that has ever been called\r\nat once into existence. \"That of Gottingen, the nearest parallel, was\r\nfounded more than a century ago, when the whole number of printed books\r\nwas less than half the present number. Should the Astor Library ever\r\nbecome a parallel to that in excellence and completeness, it will be as\r\ngreat an honor to the new world as that to the old.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPER OF WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Lexington Papers_, just published in London, we have some good\r\nanecdotes of society two hundred and fifty years ago. Here is one:\r\n\r\n\"A few days ago two ladies met in a narrow street at ten o'clock in the\r\nmorning. Neither chose to permit her carriage to be drawn back, and they\r\nremained without moving for six hours. A little after twelve o'clock\r\nthey sent for some refreshment for themselves and food for their horses.\r\nEach was firmly resolved to stay the night there rather than go back;\r\nand they would have done so, but a tavern-keeper in the street, who was\r\nprevented by their obstinacy from bringing to his door a cart laden with\r\nwine, went in search of the commissary of the district, who at length,\r\nbut with much trouble, succeeded in effecting an arrangement upon these\r\nterms--that each should retire at the same moment, and that neither\r\nshould pass through the street.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here another, which would versify into a fine horrible ballad--as\r\ngrand and ghastly as Alfred Tennyson's \"Sisters:\"\r\n\r\n\"The Parliament has lately confirmed the sentence of death passed on two\r\ndaughters of a gentleman of Anjou, named Madaillon, for the murder of\r\nthe lover of their younger sister. It appears that he was engaged to be\r\nmarried to the eldest sister, but deserting her, and passing over the\r\nsecond, he transferred his addresses to the youngest. The two eldest\r\nsisters, in revenge, invited him to play at blind man's buff, and while\r\none bound his eyes, the other cut his throat.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this is similar:\r\n\r\n\"In Piedmont a gentleman addressed at the same time one lady who was\r\nrich and plain, and one who was poor and very beautiful; and they, by\r\nchance becoming acquainted, exhibited to each other their correspondence\r\nwith the vacillating lover, and one of them invited him to a meeting, in\r\nwhich after joining in reproaches, they dexterously each deprived him of\r\nan ear.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANDREW MARVEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf this Aristides of the poets, and his homes and haunts. Mrs. S. C.\r\nHALL gives us the following interesting sketches in her \"Pilgrimages to\r\nEnglish Shrines.\" The illustrations are from drawings by F. W. Fairholt,\r\nF.S.A.\r\n\r\nBut a few months ago we had been strolling about Palace-yard, and\r\ninstinctively paused at No. 19 York-street, Westminster. It was evening;\r\nthe lamplighters were running from post to post, but we could still see\r\nthat the house was a plain house to look at, differing little from its\r\nassociate dwellings; a common house, a house you would pass without a\r\nthought, unless the remembrance of thoughts that had been given to you\r\nfrom within the shelter of those plain, ordinary walls, caused you to\r\nreflect; aye, and to thank God, who has left with you the memories and\r\nsympathies which elevate human nature. Here, while Latin secretary to\r\nthe Protector, was JOHN MILTON to be found when \"at home;\" and in his\r\nsociety, at times, were met all the men who with their great originator,\r\nCromwell, astonished Europe. Just think of those who entered that\r\nportal; think of them all if you can--statesmen and warriors; or, if you\r\nare really of a gentle spirit, think of two--but two; either of whom has\r\nleft enough to engross your thoughts and fill your hearts. Think of JOHN\r\nMILTON and ANDREW MARVEL! think of the Protector of England, with two\r\nsuch secretaries!\r\n\r\nEvening had deepened into night; busy hands were closing shutters, and\r\ndrawing curtains, to exclude the dense fog, that crept slowly and\r\nsilently, like an assassin, through the streets; the pavement was\r\nclammy, and the carriages rushing through the mist, like huge-eyed,\r\nmisshapen spectres, proved how eager even the poor horses were to find\r\nshelter; yet for a long while we stood on the steps of this building,\r\nand at length retraced our steps homeward. Our train of thought,\r\nalthough checked, was not changed, when seated by a comfortable fire. We\r\ntook down a volume of Milton; but \"Paradise Lost\" was too sublime for\r\nthe mood of the moment, and we \"got to thinking\" of Andrew Marvel, and\r\ndisplaced a volume of Captain Edward Thompson's edition of his works;\r\nand then it occurred to us to walk to Highgate, and once again enjoy the\r\nsight of his quaint old cottage on the side of the hill just facing\r\n\"Cromwell House,\" and next to that which once owned for its master the\r\ngreat Earl of Lauderdale.\r\n\r\nWe know nothing more invigorating than to breast the breeze up a hill,\r\nwith a bright clear sky above, and the crisp ground under foot. The wind\r\nof March is as pure champagne to a healthy constitution; and let\r\nmountain-men laugh as they will at Highgate-hill, it is no ordinary\r\nlabor to go and look down upon London from its height.\r\n\r\nHere then we are, once more, opposite the house where lived the\r\nsatirist, the poet, the incorruptible patriot.\r\n\r\nIt is, as you will see presently, a peculiar-looking dwelling, just such\r\na one as you might well suppose the chosen of Andrew Marvel--exquisitely\r\nsituated, enjoying abundant natural advantages; and yet altogether\r\ndevoid of pretension; sufficiently beautiful for a poet, sufficiently\r\nhumble for a patriot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARVEL'S HOUSE, FRONT VIEW.]\r\n\r\nIt is an unostentatious home, with simple gables and plain windows, and\r\nis but a story high. In front are some old trees, and a convenient porch\r\nto the door, in which to sit and look forth upon the road, a few paces\r\nin advance of it. The front is of plaster, but the windows are\r\nmodernized, and there are other alterations which the exigencies of\r\ntenancy have made necessary since Marvel's days.\r\n\r\nThe dwelling was evidently inhabited;--the curtains in the deep windows\r\nas white as they were when we visited it some years previous to the\r\nvisit concerning which we now write, and the garden as neat as when in\r\nthose days we asked permission to see the house, and were answered by an\r\nelderly servant, who took in our message; and an old gentleman came into\r\nthe hall, invited us in, and presented us to his wife, a lady of more\r\nthan middle age, and of that species of beauty depending upon\r\nexpression, which it is not in the power of time to wither, because it\r\nis of the spirit rather than the flesh; and we also remembered a green\r\nparrot, in a fine cage, that talked a great deal, and was the only thing\r\nwhich seemed out of place in the house. We had been treated with much\r\ncourtesy; and, emboldened by the memory of that kindness, we now\r\nascended the stone steps, unlatched the little gate, and knocked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARVEL'S HOUSE, BACK VIEW.]\r\n\r\nAgain we were received courteously and kindly by the lady we had\r\nformerly seen; and again she blandly offered to show us the house. We\r\nwent up a little winding stair, and into several neat, clean bedrooms,\r\nwhere every thing was so old-fashioned, that you could fancy Andrew\r\nMarvel himself was still its master.\r\n\r\n\"Look out here,\" said the old lady; \"here's a view! They say this was\r\nAndrew Marvel's writing closet when he wrote _sense_; but when he wrote\r\n_poetry_, he used to sit below in his garden. I have heard there is a\r\nprivate way under the road to Cromwell House, opposite; but surely that\r\ncould not be necessary. So good a man would not want to work in the\r\ndark; for he was a true lover of his country, and a brave man. My\r\nhusband used to say, the patriots of those times were not like the\r\npatriots now;--that then, they acted for their country,--now, they talk\r\nabout it! Alas! the days are passed when you could tell an Englishman\r\nfrom every other man, even by his gait, keeping the middle of the road,\r\nand straight on, as one who knew himself, and made others know him. I am\r\nsure a party of roundheads, in their sober coats, high hats, and heavy\r\nboots, would have walked up Highgate Hill to visit Master Andrew Marvel,\r\nwith a different air from the young men of our own time,--or of their\r\nown time, I should say,--for _my_ time is past, and _yours_ is passing.\"\r\n\r\nThat was quite true; but there is no reason, we thought, why we should\r\nnot look cheerfully towards the future, and pray that it may be a bright\r\nworld for others, if not for ourselves;--the greater our enjoyment in\r\nthe contemplation of the happiness of our fellow-creatures, the nearer\r\nwe approach God.\r\n\r\nIt was too damp for the old lady to venture into the garden; and sweet\r\nand gentle as she was, both in mind and manner, we were glad to be\r\nalone. How pretty and peaceful the house looks from this spot! The\r\nsnowdrops were quite up, and the yellow and purple tips of the crocuses\r\nbursting through the ground in all directions. This, then, was the\r\ngarden the poet loved so well, and to which he alludes so charmingly in\r\nhis poem, where the nymph complains of the death of her fawn--\r\n\r\n    \"I have a garden of my own,\r\n    But so with roses overgrown,\r\n    And lilies, that you would it guess\r\n    To be a little wilderness.\"\r\n\r\nThe garden seems in nothing changed; in fact, the entire appearance of\r\nthe place is what it was in those glorious days when inhabited by the\r\ntruest genius and the most unflinching patriot that ever sprang from the\r\nsterling stuff that Englishmen were made of in those wonder-working\r\ntimes. The genius of Andrew Marvel was as varied as it was\r\nremarkable;--not only was he a tender and exquisite poet, but entitled\r\nto stand _facile princeps_ as an incorruptible patriot, the best of\r\ncontroversialists, and the leading prose wit of England. We have always\r\nconsidered his as the first of the \"sprightly runnings\" of that\r\nbrilliant stream of wit, which will carry with it to the latent\r\nposterity the names of Swift, Steele, and Addison. Before Marvel's time,\r\nto be witty was to be strained, forced, and conceited; from him--whose\r\nmemory consecrates that cottage--wit came sparkling forth, untouched by\r\nbaser matter. It was worthy of him; its main feature was an open\r\nclearness. Detraction or jealousy cast no stain upon it; he turned\r\naside, in the midst of an exalted panegyric to Oliver Cromwell, to say\r\nthe finest things that ever were said of Charles I.\r\n\r\nThe Patriot was the son of Mr. Andrew Marvel, minister and schoolmaster\r\nof Kingston-upon-Hull, where he was born in 1620; his father was also\r\nthe lecturer of Trinity Church in that town, and was celebrated as a\r\nlearned and pious man. The son's abilities at an early age were\r\nremarkable, and his progress so great, that at the age of thirteen, he\r\nwas entered as a student of Trinity College, Cambridge; and it is said\r\nthat the corporation of his natal town furnished him with the means of\r\nentering the college and prosecuting his studies there. His shrewd and\r\ninquiring mind attracted the attention of some of the Jesuit emissaries\r\nwho were at this time lurking about the universities, and sparing no\r\npains to make proselytes. Marvel entered into disputations with them,\r\nand ultimately fell so far into their power, that he consented to\r\nabandon the University and follow one of them to London. Like many other\r\nclever youths, he was inattentive to the mere drudgery of university\r\nattendance, and had been reprimanded in consequence; this, and the news\r\nof his escape from college, reached his father's ears at Hull. That good\r\nand anxious parent followed him to London; and, after a considerable\r\nsearch, at last met with him in a bookseller's shop; he argued with his\r\nson as a prudent and sensible man should do, and prevailed on him to\r\nretrace his steps and return with him to college, where he applied to\r\nhis studies with such good-will and continued assiduity, that he\r\nobtained the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1638. His father lived to see\r\nthe fruits of his wise advice, but was only spared thus long; for he was\r\nunfortunately drowned in crossing the Humber, as he was attending the\r\ndaughter of an intimate female friend, who, by this event becoming\r\nchildless, sent for young Marvel, and by way of making all the return in\r\nher power, added considerably to his fortune.\r\n\r\nThis accession of wealth gave him an opportunity of travelling, and he\r\njourneyed through Holland, France, and Italy. While at Rome he wrote the\r\nfirst of those satirical poems which obtained him so much celebrity. It\r\nwas a satire on an English priest there, a wretched poetaster named\r\nFlecknoe. From an early period of life Marvel appears to have despised\r\nconceit, or impertinence, and he found another chance to exhibit his\r\npowers of satire in the person of an ecclesiastic of Paris, one Joseph\r\nde Maniban, an abbot who pretended to understand the characters of those\r\nhe had never seen, and to prognosticate their good or bad fortune, from\r\nan inspection of their handwriting. Marvel addressed a poem to him,\r\nwhich, if it did not effectually silence his pretensions, at all events\r\nexposed them fully to the thinking portions of the community.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROMWELL HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nBeneath Italian skies his immortal friendship with Milton seems to have\r\ncommenced; it was of rapid growth, but was soon firmly established. They\r\nwere, in many ways, kindred spirits, and their hopes for the after\r\ndestinies of England were alike. In 1653 Marvel returned to England, and\r\nduring the eventful years that followed, we can find no record of his\r\nstrong and earnest thoughts, as they worked upwards into the arena of\r\npublic life. One glorious fact we know, and all who honor virtue must\r\nfeel its force,--that in an age when wealth was never wanting to the\r\nunscrupulous, Marvel, a member of the popular and successful party,\r\ncontinued Poor. Many of those years he is certain to have passed--\r\n\r\n    \"Under the destiny severe\r\n    Of Fairfax, and the starry Vere--\"\r\n\r\nin the humble capacity of tutor of languages to their daughters. It was\r\nmost likely, during this period, that he inhabited the cottage at\r\nHighgate, opposite to the house in which lived part of the family of\r\nCromwell, a house upon which we shall remark presently. In 1657 he was\r\nintroduced by Milton to Bradshaw. The precise words of the introduction\r\nran thus: 'I present to you Mr. Marvel, laying aside those jealousies\r\nand that emulation which mine own condition might suggest to me, by\r\nbringing in such a coadjutor.' His connection with the State took place\r\nin 1657, when he became assistant secretary with Milton in the service\r\nof the Protector. 'I never had,' says Marvel, 'any, not the remotest\r\nrelation to public matters, nor correspondence with the persons then\r\npredominant, until the year 1657.'\r\n\r\nAfter he had been some time fellow-secretary with Milton, even the\r\nthick-sighted burgesses of Hull perceived the merits of their townsman,\r\nand sent him as their representative into the House of Commons. We can\r\nimagine the delight he felt at escaping from the crowded and stormy\r\nCommons to breathe the invigorating air of his favorite hill, to enjoy\r\nthe society of his former pupils, now his friends; and to gather, in\r\n\r\n    '----a garden of his own,'\r\n\r\nthe flowers that had solaced his leisure hours when he was comparatively\r\nunknown. But Cromwell died, Charles returned, and Marvel's energies\r\nsprung into arms at acts which, in accordance with his principles, he\r\nconsidered base, and derogatory to his country. His whole efforts were\r\ndirected to the preservation of civil and religious liberty.\r\n\r\nIt was but a short time previous to the Restoration that Marvel had been\r\nchosen by his native town to sit as its representative in Parliament.\r\nThe Session began at Westminster in April, 1660, and he acquitted\r\nhimself so honorably, that he was again chosen for the one which began\r\nin May, 1661. Whether under Cromwell or Charles, he acted with such\r\nthorough honesty of purpose, and gave such satisfaction to his\r\nconstituents, that they allowed him a handsome pension all the time he\r\ncontinued to represent them, which was till the day of his death. This\r\nwas probably the last borough in England that paid a representative.[A]\r\nHe seldom spoke in Parliament, but had much influence with the members\r\nof both Houses; the spirited Earl of Devonshire called him friend, and\r\nPrince Rupert particularly paid the greatest regard to his councils; and\r\nwhenever he voted according to the sentiments of Marvel, which he often\r\ndid, it used to be said, by the opposite party, that 'he had been with\r\nhis tutor.' Such certainly was the intimacy between the Prince and\r\nMarvel, that when he was obliged to abscond, to avoid falling a\r\nsacrifice to the indignation of those enemies among the governing party\r\nwhom his satirical pen had irritated, the Prince frequently went to see\r\nhim, disguised as a private person.\r\n\r\nThe noted Doctor Samuel Parker published Bishop Bramhall's work, setting\r\nforth the rights of kings over the consciences of their subjects, and\r\nthen came forth Marvel's witty and sarcastic poem, 'The Rehearsal\r\nTransposed.'[B] And yet how brightly did the generosity of his noble\r\nnature shine forth at this very time, when he forsook his own wit in\r\nthat very poem, to praise the wit of Butler, his rival and political\r\nenemy. Fortune seems about this period to have dealt hardly with him.\r\nEven while his political satires rang through the very halls of the\r\npampered and impure Charles, when they were roared forth in every\r\ntavern, shouted in the public streets, and attracted the most envied\r\nattention throughout England, their author was obliged to exchange the\r\nfree air, apt type of the freedom which he loved, for a lodging in a\r\ncourt off the Strand, where, enduring unutterable temptations, flattered\r\nand threatened, he more than realized the stories of Roman virtue.\r\n\r\nThe poet Mason has made Marvel the hero of his 'Ode to Independence,'\r\nand thus alludes to his incorruptible integrity:--\r\n\r\n    'In awful Poverty his honest Muse\r\n      Walks forth Vindictive through a venal land;\r\n    In vain Corruption sheds her golden dews,\r\n      In vain Oppression lifts her iron hand;\r\n    He scorns them both, and arm'd with Truth alone,\r\n    Bids Lust and Folly tremble on the throne.'\r\n\r\nMarvel, by opposing the ministry and its measures, created himself many\r\nenemies,[C] and made himself very obnoxious to the government, yet\r\nCharles II. took great delight in his conversation, and tried all means\r\nto win him over to his side, but in vain; nothing being ever able to\r\nshake his resolution. There were many instances of his firmness in\r\nresisting the offers of the Court, in which he showed himself proof\r\nagainst all temptations.\r\n\r\nWe close our eyes upon this peaceful dwelling of the heroic senator, and\r\nimagine ourselves in the reign of the second Charles, threading our way\r\ninto that 'court off the Strand,' where Marvel ended his days. We enter\r\nthe house, and climbing the stairs even to the second floor, perceive\r\nthe object of our warmest admiration. He is not alone, though there is\r\nno possibility of confounding the poet with the courtier. Andrew Marvel\r\nis plainly dressed, his figure is strong, and about the middle size, his\r\ncountenance open, and his complexion of a ruddy cast; his eyes are of a\r\nsoft hazel color, mild and steady; his eyebrows straight, and so\r\nflexible as to mould without an effort into a satirical curve, if such\r\nbe the mind's desire; his mouth is close, and indicative of firmness;\r\nand his brown hair falls gracefully back from a full and noble forehead.\r\nHe sits in an upright and determined manner upon an uneasy-looking\r\nhigh-backed chair. A somewhat long table intervenes between him and his\r\nvisitor; one end of it is covered with a white cloth, and a dish of cold\r\nmeat is flanked by a loaf of bread and a dark earthenware jug. On the\r\nopposite end is placed a bag of gold, beside which lies the\r\nrichly-embroidered glove which the cavalier with whom he is conversing\r\nhas flung off. There is strange contrast in the attitude of the two men.\r\nLord Danby lounges with the ease of a courtier and the grace of a\r\ngentleman upon a chair of as stiff and uncomfortable an appearance as\r\nthat which is occupied after so upright a fashion by Andrew Marvel.\r\n\r\n\"I have answered you, my lord,\" said the patriot, \"already. Methinks\r\nthere need be no further parley on the subject; it is not my first\r\ntemptation, though I most fervently desire it may be the last.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STAIRCASE.]\r\n\r\nThe nobleman took up his glove and drew it on. \"I again pray you to\r\nconsider,\" he said, \"whether, if with us, the very usefulness you so\r\nmuch prize would not have a more extensive sphere. You would have larger\r\nmeans of being useful.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord, I should certainly have the means of tempting usefulness to\r\nforsake duty.\"\r\n\r\nThe cavalier rose, but the displeasure that flushed his countenance soon\r\nfaded before the serene and holy expression of Milton's friend.\r\n\r\n\"And are you so determined?\" said his lordship, sorrowfully. \"Are you\r\nreally so determined? A thousand English pounds are there, and thrice\r\nthe sum--nay, any thing you ask----\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord! my lord!\" interrupted Marvel, indignantly, \"this perseverance\r\nborders upon insult. Nay, my good lord, you do not so intend it, but\r\nyour master does not understand me. Pray you, note this: two days ago\r\nthat meat was hot; it has remained cold since, and there is enough still\r\nfor to-morrow; and I am well content. A man so easily satisfied is not\r\nlikely to exchange an approving conscience for dross like that!\"\r\n\r\nWe pray God that the sin of Marvel's death did not rest with the great\r\nones of those times; but it was strange and sudden.[D] He did not leave\r\nwherewith to bury the sheath of such a noble spirit, but his\r\nconstituents furnished forth a decent funeral, and would have erected a\r\nmonument to his memory in the church of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, where\r\nhe was interred; but the rector, blinded by the dust of royalty to the\r\nmerits of the man, refused the necessary permission. Marvel's name is\r\nremembered, though the rector's has been long forgotten.[E]\r\n\r\nWood tells us, that Marvel was in his conversation very modest, and of\r\nfew words; and Cooke, the writer of his life, observes that he was very\r\nreserved among those whom he did not know, but a most delightful and\r\nimproving companion among his friends. John Aubrey, who knew him\r\npersonally, thus describes him: 'He was of a middling stature, pretty\r\nstrong set, roundish cherry-checked, hazle-eyed, brown-haired.' He was\r\n(as Wood also says) in conversation very modest, and of a very few\r\nwords. He was wont to say, that he would not drink high or freely with\r\nany one with whom he would not trust his life.\r\n\r\nMarvel lived among friends at Highgate; exactly opposite to his door was\r\nthe residence of General Ireton and his wife Bridget, the eldest\r\ndaughter of Oliver Cromwell; and which house still bears his name, and\r\nis described in 'Prickett's History of Highgate,' one of those local\r\ntopographical works which deserve encouragement:--'Cromwell House is\r\nsupposed to have been built by the Protector, whose name it bears, about\r\nthe year 1630, as a residence for General Ireton, who married his\r\ndaughter and was one of the commanders of his army; it is, however, said\r\nto have been the residence of Oliver Cromwell himself, but no mention is\r\nmade, either in history or in his biography, of his having ever lived at\r\nHighgate. Tradition states, there was a subterraneous passage from this\r\nhouse to the mansion house which stood where the New Church now stands,\r\nbut of its reality no proof has hitherto been adduced. Cromwell House\r\nwas evidently built and internally ornamented in accordance with the\r\ntaste of its military occupant. The staircase, which is of handsome\r\nproportions, is richly decorated with oaken carved figures, supposed to\r\nhave been of persons in the general's army, in their costume; and the\r\nbalustrades filled in with devices emblematical of warfare. On the\r\nceilings of the drawing-room are the arms of General Ireton; this and\r\nthe ceilings of the other principal apartments are enriched in\r\nconformity with the fashion of those days. The proportion of the noble\r\nrooms, as well as the brick-work in front, well deserves the notice and\r\nstudy of the antiquarian and the architect. From the platform on the top\r\nof the mansion may be seen a perfect panorama of the surrounding\r\ncountry.'\r\n\r\nThe staircase above described is here engraved. It is a remarkably\r\nstriking and elegant specimen of internal decoration, of broad and noble\r\nproportion, and of a solid and grand construction suitable to the time\r\nof its erection; the wood-work of the house is every where equally bold\r\nand massive; the door-cases of simple but good design. There are some\r\nceilings in the first story which are in rich plaster work, ornamented\r\nwith the arms of Ireton; and mouldings of fruit and flowers, of a\r\nsumptuous and bold enrichment.\r\n\r\nThe series of figures which stand upon the newels of the staircase are\r\nall engraved below. There are ten remaining out of twelve, the original\r\nnumber; the missing two are said to have been figures of Cromwell and\r\nIreton, destroyed at the Restoration. They stand about a foot in height,\r\nand represent the different soldiers of the army, from the fifer and\r\ndrummer to the captain, and originally, to the commanders. They are\r\ncurious for more reasons than one; their locality, their truthfulness,\r\ntheir history, and the picture they help us to realise of the army of\r\nCromwell are all so many claims on our attention.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] The custom of paying members of the House of Commons for the loss of\r\ntime and travelling expenses, was common in the seventeenth century;\r\nconstituencies believed such equivalents necessary for the attention to\r\ntheir interests and wishes which a Parliamentary agent was expected to\r\ngive. In the old Corporation books of provincial towns are many entries\r\nfor payments to members of Parliament, and in some instances we find\r\nthem petitioning to Government for disfranchisement, because they could\r\nnot afford to pay the expenses of a Member.\r\n\r\n[B] Marvel's first _expose_ of Parker's false logic was in 1672, in the\r\npoem named above, which was immediately answered by Parker, and\r\nre-answered by Marvel, who appears to have had some private threat sent\r\nhim, as he says his pamphlet is occasioned by two letters; one the\r\npublished 'Reproof' of him by Parker in answer to his first attack; 'the\r\nsecond, left for me at a friend's house, dated November 3d, 1673,\r\nsubscribed J. G., and concluding with these words:--If thou darest to\r\nprint any lie or libel against Dr. Parker, by the Eternal--I will cut\r\nthy throat.' This last reply of Marvel's, however, effectually silenced\r\nParker: 'It not only humbled Parker, but the whole party,' says Burnet,\r\nfor, 'from the king down to the tradesman, the book was read with\r\npleasure.'\r\n\r\n[C] 'No stronger satire could be penned than that descriptive of the\r\nCourt of Charles, in the poem called 'Britannia and Raleigh:'--\r\n\r\n    'A colony of French possess the Court,\r\n  Pimps, priests, buffoons, in privy chambers sport;\r\n  Such slimy monsters ne'er approach'd a throne\r\n  Since Pharaoh's days, nor so defil'd a crown;\r\n  In sacred ears tyrannic arts they croak,\r\n  Pervert his mind, and good intentions choak.'\r\n\r\nBut not only do the courtiers feel the lash, for when Raleigh implores\r\nBritannia to urge his duty on the king, and save him from the bad who\r\nsurround him, she interrupts him with--\r\n\r\n  'Raleigh, no more! for long in vain I've try'd\r\n  The Stuart from the tyrant to divide.'\r\n\r\n\r\n[D] 'Marvel died in 1678, in his fifty-eighth year, not without the\r\nstrongest suspicions of having been poisoned; for he was always very\r\ntemperate, and of an healthful and strong constitution to the last.'\r\n\r\n[E] On the death of this rector, however, the monument and inscription\r\nwas placed on the north wall of the church, near the spot where he is\r\nsupposed to lie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NOVELIST'S APPEAL FOR THE CANADAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the new English novels is one entitled _Ellen Clayton, or the\r\nNomades of the West_, by Douglass Huyghue. The author seems to feel for\r\nthe red men the same regard which the adventurous artist and traveller\r\nCatlin has expressed in England, and his work comes in aid of those\r\nappeals which Catlin has so often made on their behalf. Such a motive\r\nentitles the author to respect, and gives an additional value to the\r\nbook; while the talent with which it is written, renders it a narrative\r\nof unusual interest. In nothing but its _theme_ is it like to any of\r\nCooper's novels. Its incidents and its characters are not similar, and\r\nthey lack truthfulness quite as much as they lack similarity. We know\r\nsomething of Indian life; in our youth we saw much of it; and we regard\r\nCooper as its faithfulest delineator in literary art. The time at which\r\nthis romance opens is in the year 1600, when the wars between France and\r\nEngland led to hostilities in Canada, and when an abortive attack was\r\nmade upon Quebec by the British and colonial army. The hero and heroine\r\nare victims to the disasters of that war, and in describing their\r\nadventures, Canada, and the condition of its civilized as well as of its\r\nwild inhabitants, are vividly presented. The incidents justify the\r\nauthor in making this appeal to his English readers when he reminds them\r\nof the associations that should ever be connected with the fortress of\r\nQuebec:--\r\n\r\n     \"Men of England, look not coldly upon the interests of that\r\n     land for the possession of which your fathers fought and bled.\r\n     Quench not irretrievably the flame of loyalty which burns in\r\n     many an earnest heart, loath to contract these new ties which\r\n     the progress of an irresistible destiny would seem to favor, at\r\n     the sacrifice of affection for the fatherland. The blood of the\r\n     greatest and wisest nation since the days of the Romans, flows\r\n     in the veins of the Anglo-Americans, unadulterated by the air\r\n     of another hemisphere, and stimulated into vigorous action by a\r\n     necessity for continual exertion, combined with an entire\r\n     liberty of thought which calls into play every resource of the\r\n     physical and intellectual man. The sturdy and intelligent race\r\n     that treads the virgin soil of Canada, can surely claim\r\n     equality, at the very least, with the denizens of older Europe;\r\n     cramped as they are for want of room, and enervated by an\r\n     ultra-civilization that wrongs nature, and has almost taken the\r\n     sceptre from her hand to put it into that of art. The British\r\n     colonist enjoys a peculiar exemption from those prejudices,\r\n     which, for so many ages, have retarded progress, and are\r\n     successively being overcome by the convictions of a more\r\n     enlightened era. There is a voice in the woods and mountains of\r\n     a great solitude that elevates the soul and fortifies it with\r\n     courage in the time of need. The great torrents and inland seas\r\n     of that noble country have schooled the generation, nurtured by\r\n     their side, into a strong conception of freedom, and the right\r\n     to be justly dealt with, at the hands of those with whom it is\r\n     connected by the double alliance of kindred predilection. A\r\n     pernicious, temporizing policy has of late caused such wounds\r\n     as may not be healed up very easily, we fear. The upright\r\n     colonist has seen an unprincipled faction permitted to ride\r\n     triumphant over those whose intentions are honest, and whose\r\n     loyalty is proven. Let us hope, that ere long something of the\r\n     chivalrous generosity of other days will pervade the councils\r\n     of the state, and rouse the stalwart spirit of the Briton to\r\n     scourge this ignominy from the land; if encouragement be due at\r\n     all, it surely is to those true-hearted provincials who are\r\n     avowedly proud of the great people from whence they derive\r\n     their character, their language, and their laws--and who are as\r\n     able, as they are willing, to preserve unto their beloved\r\n     Sovereign the colony their sires won.\"\r\n\r\nThis is tolerably good rhetoric, but it is not likely to have much\r\neffect when the strong argument and imposing eloquence of statesmen have\r\nfailed to arrest attention. We see notices of another political novel\r\nreferring to Canada, which deals more directly, if with less talent,\r\nwith the disabilities and wishes of the people. It is entitled, _The\r\nFootsteps of Montcalm_, and its hero, descended from a follower of the\r\nbrave Frenchman, contrasts with his ideal of freedom and happiness, the\r\nlaws, institutions, habits, and miseries, which he regards as\r\ninseparable from the colonial relation. As in the rebellion of 1838,\r\nwhatever disaffection now prevails in British America, is probably\r\nshared much less largely by the English than by the French population.\r\nPolitical, religious, or sectarian novels, however, executed never so\r\ncleverly, are but sugared pills at which the appetite revolts as soon as\r\nthe quality is discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. WEBSTER, PRESIDENT OF THE NEW-YORK FREE ACADEMY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the world an extraordinary degree of attention has recently\r\nbeen directed to systems and means of Education, and the truth has at\r\nlength been generally recognized that the stability and glory of nations\r\nmust depend upon the intelligence and virtue of their inhabitants. In\r\nour own country, which is most of all interested in the diffusion of\r\nknowledge, unexampled efforts are being made not only for the general\r\nimprovement of the culture offered in the seminaries, but for that\r\nelevation of the laboring classes which, whatever may be said by\r\nambitious feeble-minds, seeking for reputation as reformers of the\r\nsocial system, is really to be found only in a wise development of\r\nindividual capacities for the strife that has been and must be waged for\r\nindividual well-being.\r\n\r\nThere have been many improvements suggested or realized lately in\r\ncollegiate education. We have been gratified with Professor Sedgwick's\r\nadmirable treatise on the subject, which, at this time, is receiving in\r\nEngland that consideration to which any thing from the mind of one so\r\ndistinguished is entitled. In this country we think no one, upon the\r\nwhole, has written more wisely than Dr. Wayland, whose views are to be\r\nillustrated in the future government of the university over which he has\r\nso long presided. But we shall not be satisfied until we have a great\r\ninstitution, as much above the existing colleges as they are above the\r\ncommon schools in the wards of the city, to which bachelors of arts only\r\nshall be admitted, and to which they, whether coming from Harvard,\r\nOberlin, or Virginia, shall be admitted without charge.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the NEW-YORK FREE ACADEMY is suggestive of many\r\nthings, and of this among them. We suppose a discussion whether our\r\ncolleges supply the _degree_ of education suitable to our general\r\ncondition, could be entertained only by dunces; the point whether they\r\nfurnish the kind and quality of culture to fit men for efficient and\r\njust action, in such public affairs and private occupations as the\r\nhumblest may be called to in a free state, has been amply discussed, and\r\nit is decided against the colleges.\r\n\r\nOur schools, called colleges, have for the most part been fashioned\r\nafter the universities of Europe, but they have in all cases been\r\ninadequately endowed, and without the internal police which is necessary\r\nto their vigorous administration. Nine-tenths of the professors are\r\nincompetent, and quite one half of them, in any thing worthy the name of\r\nuniversity could claim admission only to the class of freshmen; while\r\nthose who are capable of a reputable performance of their duties--so\r\nuncertain are the revenues of the institutions to which they are\r\nattached--are very frequently compelled to modify regulations and relax\r\ndiscipline to such a degree that the colleges become only schools of\r\nvice or nurseries of indolence.\r\n\r\nThe deficiency is of _authority_. It is useless to talk about courses of\r\nstudy, or any thing else, until the discipline of the schools is as\r\nabsolute as that of the camp, the factory, or the counting-room. We are\r\ninclined to believe that the usefulness of the Military Academy at West\r\nPoint,--which has furnished so large a proportion of the best civil\r\nengineers, lawyers, physicians, and divines, as well as the soldiers who\r\nand who _alone_ have conducted our armies to real glory,--we are\r\ninclined to believe that this justly celebrated school owes all its\r\ntriumphs to its rigid laws and independence of popular clamor.\r\n\r\nDiscipline is every thing. Without it a man is but a fair model in wood,\r\nwhich by it is turned to an engine of iron, and by opportunity furnished\r\nwith water and fire to impel it on a resistless course through the\r\nworld. And a man must be governed by others before he will govern\r\nhimself. The silliness about _liberty_ which is sometimes obtruded into\r\ndiscussions of this subject, is fit for very young children and very old\r\nwomen. There is no desirable liberty but in obedience. The cant about it\r\nsometimes illustrates only a pitiable feebleness of intellect, but it\r\nmore frequently discloses some kind or degree of wilful licentiousness.\r\nThe \"voluntary system\" does very well in the churches. It will not do at\r\nall in the colleges. St. Paul is always found even with the wisdom of\r\nthe age in which he is quoted, and he tells us that a youth \"differeth\r\nnothing from a servant, though he be lord of all, but is under tutors\r\nand governors.\" This is the true philosophy. The \"sovereign\" people who\r\ndisregard law, and exult when it is outraged at the cost of an unpopular\r\nparty, have not learned what is necessary to freedom; they are not fit\r\nfor it; they will destroy its fairest fabrics, if the state does not\r\nprepare its children by a thorough discipline for their inheritance. The\r\n_way_ is by free schools and free colleges, supported by public taxes.\r\nSects and parties may have as many seminaries as they choose, and with\r\nrules of study and conduct so easily to be complied with, and\r\nadministrations so lax, that the most contemptible idler or the most\r\nindependent and self-willed simpleton shall see in them nothing to\r\nconflict with his habit or temper; but the graduates of these seminaries\r\nwill not ascend the pinnacles of fame nor direct the affairs of nations:\r\nsuch affairs will be left for those who have learned, with their\r\narithmetic, the self-denial, reverence and obedience, which are the\r\nconditions of the application of addition and division in the high\r\nmathematics.\r\n\r\nIn a free college (and the New-York Free Academy is, in all respects,\r\nmore justly to be considered a college than are most of the schools\r\nwhich confer academical \"honors\"), in a free college, of which the\r\nprofessors are responsible only to a judicious board of directors,\r\nexaminations for admissions and for advancements will be rigid and\r\nimpartial, the administration will be vigilant and firm, the reckless\r\nwho will not and the imbecile who cannot acquire a good education, will\r\nbe dismissed for more congenial pursuits, the rich and the poor will be\r\nupon an equality, and only desert will be honorably distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe New-York Free Academy is eminently fortunate in its officers. HORACE\r\nWEBSTER, LL. D., is, in all respects, admirably fitted for his position\r\nas its President. He perfectly understands the indispensableness of\r\nthorough organization, and absolute and watchful discipline. Dr. Webster\r\nis a native of Vermont, and is of that family which, in various\r\ndepartments, has furnished the country some of its most illustrious\r\nnames. At an early age, he became a student of the Military Academy, and\r\nso has himself experience of the advantages of that system which he\r\nadvocates, and illustrates in his own administration. He graduated with\r\ndistinction, and it is properly mentioned as an indication of his\r\nstanding at West Point that, while he was a cadet of the first class, he\r\nwas selected by the government of the Academy to be temporarily himself\r\nan instructor. In 1818 he joined the army, as a lieutenant, and after\r\npassing one year with his regiment, of which the late General Taylor was\r\nat that time the Major, he was elected Assistant Professor of\r\nMathematics in the Military Academy, and returned to fulfil for six\r\nyears, with constantly increasing reputation, both for scientific\r\nabilities and for personal character, the duties of that office, which\r\nit scarcely need be said are more difficult at West Point than in any\r\nother school in America. Among the distinguished gentlemen who were\r\nassociated with him in teaching or as students during this period, were\r\nGeneral Worth, Colonel Bliss, Colonel Thayer, Colonel Mansfield, and\r\nProfessors Alexander D. Bache, LL. D., Charles Davies, LL. D., E. C.\r\nRoss, LL. D., and John Torrey, LL. D. Resigning his commission, he was\r\nin 1825 made Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in Geneva\r\nCollege, and he filled this place twenty-three years, leaving it in\r\n1848, to accept the Presidency of the New York Free Academy. We conceive\r\nthat nothing could have invested this school with a higher claim to\r\nrespect, or challenged for it a larger degree of confidence, than the\r\nselection of a man of such experience, capacities, and reputation, to be\r\nits chief officer; and for the class of persons likely to come under his\r\ninstruction, no course of study could be more judicious, no training\r\nmore admirably adapted, than may be expected from one who has been so\r\nlong and so successfully engaged in preparing men for the most difficult\r\nand important offices. His attainments needed no illustration, and his\r\nadministrative abilities have been amply vindicated by his government of\r\nthe Free Academy.\r\n\r\nCandidates for admission to the Free Academy must have passed at least\r\none year in the public schools, and they are examined in the common\r\nEnglish studies. The standards for admission are not so high as the\r\ncolleges demand, because the period of instruction is longer. We cannot\r\nenter into any particular statement of the courses of study, but it\r\nwill be interesting if we indicate their character very briefly, and\r\ndescribe the chief teachers. Edward C. Ross, LL. D., the Professor of\r\nMathematics, is, like Dr. Webster, a graduate of the Military Academy,\r\nand was many years a successful teacher in that institution and in\r\nKenyon College. He is assisted by G. B. Docherty, A. M., who was\r\nformerly the Principal of the Flushing Institute. The course embraces\r\nall the studies necessary for the best accomplishment in engineering,\r\nand indeed is as thorough and complete as that pursued at West Point,\r\nwith the modifications appropriate to the prospective pursuits of the\r\npupils. Theodore Irving, A. M., is Professor of History and\r\nBelles-Lettres, assisted by Edward C. Marshall, A. M., and G. W.\r\nHuntsman, A. M. These gentlemen have experience, and we believe their\r\nsystem of instruction is in some respects original and in every way very\r\nexcellent. Mr. Irving is a kinsman of \"Geoffrey Crayon,\" and himself\r\nmaster of a pleasing and classical style. Oliver Wolcott Gibbs, A. M.,\r\nM. D., Professor of Chemistry, Natural Philosophy, Mineralogy, and\r\nGeology, is one of the best practical chemists in this country, having\r\ncompleted his own education under the celebrated Liebig, in Germany, and\r\nsince in many ways evinced such capacities in this department, as made\r\nhis selection for the place he occupies almost a matter of course. John\r\nJ. Owen, D. D., whose scholarship is exhibited in his ably edited series\r\nof the classical authors of these languages, is Professor of Greek and\r\nLatin, and we neither agree with nor have much respect for those who\r\ndeprecate the attention demanded in the Academy for such studies. The\r\nFrench, Spanish and German languages are taught by Professors Roemer,\r\nMorales, and Glaubensklee, all of whom are known to the public for such\r\ntalents as are necessary in their positions. Mr. Paul P. Duggan, a\r\npainter whose works adorn many of our best collections in art, is\r\nProfessor of Drawing.\r\n\r\nThe Free Academy will fulfil the reasonable expectations of its\r\nfounders. It is admirably designed, and its appointments and\r\nadministration have thus far been judicious. We lack yet a University:\r\nthere is no school in America deserving this title; all our colleges\r\nshould be regarded as _gymnasia_, sifting the classes of the common\r\nschools and preparing their more advanced and ingenious pupils for such\r\nan institution; and the Free Academy may be accepted as a model by which\r\nthey can be reshaped for their less ambitious but more appropriate\r\nduties. This is a subject ably and properly treated in Professor\r\nTappan's recent volume on Education, (published by Mr. Putnam,) to which\r\nwe beg attention.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of students now attending the Free Academy is three\r\nhundred and twenty-nine, of whom one hundred and five were admitted at\r\nthe last examination, in February. The number for whom the building is\r\ndesigned is about six hundred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthors and Books.\r\n\r\n\r\nA book which we cannot too highly recommend is the _Briefe ueber\r\nHumboldt's Kosmos_ (Letters on Humboldt's Cosmos), published at Leipzic,\r\nin two octavo volumes, from the pens of Professor COTTA and Professor\r\nSCHALLER. It is intended to serve as a commentary upon that work, which\r\nit is well worthy to accompany. Without attempting an exhaustive\r\ntreatise on the details of the various topics touched on by Humboldt,\r\nthe writers have expanded some of the leading points of his work into\r\nscientific essays, whose practical utility is none the smaller for an\r\nelegant and attractive style, and a genial enthusiasm, of which Humboldt\r\nneed not be ashamed. The first volume, by Professor Cotta, contains\r\nforty letters on the following themes: The enjoyment of nature; matter\r\nand forces, growth and existence; natural philosophy; the fixed stars,\r\ntheir parallaxes, groups, movements, nebulae; double stars, structure of\r\nthe universe, resisting medium; the solar system; the laws of motion,\r\nKepler and Newton; density of the heavenly bodies; our moon, its orbit,\r\nno atmosphere, no water; comets; meteors, and meteoric stones; form of\r\nthe earth; magnetism; volcanic activity; gas-springs; geysers; internal\r\nstructure of the earth; history of organisms, their first origin, and\r\ndevelopments; the surface, its forms, and their influence on animated\r\nlife; the gradual rising and sinking of the surface in Sweden; the\r\ntides; circulation of water on the earth--springs, cold, warm, mineral,\r\nartesian--rivers, seas, ocean currents, evaporation and condensation;\r\nglaciers; the atmosphere, climate, weather, winds, storm-clouds; organic\r\nlife on the earth, its nature, differences, origin of the differences,\r\noriginal production, creation, first appearance; man, his origin, races,\r\nforms, phrenology, &c. These letters offer, as we have already said, in\r\na pleasing and attractive form, a condensed and comprehensive view of\r\nwhat is now known with reference to the sciences treated. The letter\r\nupon Man is especially interesting. Professor Cotta belongs to those who\r\nthink the human race to be \"the gradual perfection, through thousands of\r\ngenerations,\" of a lower order of creatures. \"The human individual,\" he\r\nsays, \"even now, in the embryonic state, passes through the condition of\r\nvarious sorts of animals. The most eminent anatomists have shown that\r\nbefore birth we for a time resemble a polypal animal, then for a time a\r\nfish, next a reptile, till at last appear the characteristics of a\r\nmammalia. This is a fact which bears strongly in favor of our view. The\r\ngenesis and development of the entire species seem to be here condensed\r\nin the growth of the individual.\" But while setting forth this peculiar\r\nview, Professor Cotta, with true German comprehensiveness, takes care to\r\ngive a fair statement of opposing doctrines, and evinces nothing like a\r\nnarrow dogmatism. The second volume, like the second volume of the\r\nCosmos, is that which will most interest and delight the general reader.\r\nIt contains thirty-two letters, mainly on the following subjects: the\r\nview of nature in general; the religious view; the various forms of the\r\nreligious view; the aesthetic view; the inward connection of the aesthetic\r\nenjoyment of nature with its artistic representation; the scientific\r\nview as empirical science and natural philosophy; the relations of the\r\nvarious views of nature to each other; the poetic comprehension of\r\nnature among the Indians; the poetic comprehension of nature among the\r\nJews, the Greeks, and the Romans; the Christian contemplation of nature;\r\nGerman poetry in the middle ages; Italian poetry; the poetic\r\ncomprehension of nature in modern times; the representation of nature by\r\npainting, and its gradual appearance in the history of art; the\r\nphysiognomy of plants in connection with the physiognomy of nature in\r\ngeneral; description of several plant formations; general outlines of\r\nthe animal world; history of the physical view of the universe; natural\r\nscience among the Phenicians, the Greeks, at the time of the Ptolemies,\r\nat the time of the Roman Empire, and in the middle ages; natural history\r\nof modern times, Bacon, Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Newton; the\r\nmechanical doctrine of modern physics; the dynamic view of nature;\r\nFichte's doctrine, and the natural philosophy of Schelling and Hegel.\r\nThis volume, as will be easily understood, gives at once a history of\r\nreligion, philosophy, art, literature, and science, in their relations\r\nto the outward universe. For instance, under the head of natural science\r\namong the Greeks, we have among other things an account of the doctrine\r\nof the Pythagoreans, Plato, and Aristotle; in treating the middle ages,\r\nProfessor Schaller speaks of the Scholastics, Thomas Aquinas, Roger\r\nBacon, Giordano Bruno, and Paracelsus. One of the most interesting parts\r\nof the whole is that on the poetic view of nature among the Hindoos,\r\nJews, Greeks, Romans, Germans, and Italians, the historical statement\r\nbeing every where illustrated by copious quotations of admirable\r\npassages from the poets of those nations. The strictly scientific\r\nportions are illustrated by excellent engravings, and are free from mere\r\ntechnicalities. Sold in New-York by R.

Eusebe-Francois de Salles has just published at\r\nParis an elaborate work on Ethnography, for which he had prepared\r\nhimself by long and careful personal observation of most of the races on\r\nthe globe, his travels having extended into nearly all climes and\r\nregions. He takes the ground of the descent of the entire human family\r\nfrom a single pair, created adult and perfect in mind and body, not by\r\nany simple evolution of nature, but by a direct act of the Divine Being.\r\nThe paradise or home of this pair he places to the north of India and\r\nthe east of Persia. All the varieties of men now existing he attributes\r\nto the influence of climate and circumstances. \"The first light of\r\nhistory,\" he says, \"shows us the human family in possession of a\r\nlanguage, and of a certain degree of science, the inheritance of the\r\npast. Its aptitudes, its passions, and outward circumstances, may\r\nincrease this inheritance, keep it the same, or diminish it. In peoples\r\nenervated by luxury and by doubt, in tribes softened by too favorable a\r\nclimate, or separated too long from the stronger and better educated\r\nmasses,--in a family or a couple exiled by a catastrophe, a\r\nshipwreck,--we are to seek the origin of the decline into the various\r\ndegrees of _corruption, barbarism_, the _savage state_, and _brutality_.\r\nImagine a boat from the coast of America, or from the South Sea Islands,\r\ncast by a tempest on some unknown shore or some desert island. A few\r\nyoung persons, a few children, alone escape from the shipwreck, knowing\r\nimperfectly the language, the arts, and the family traditions of their\r\nparents. Such is the origin of the unfortunates sometimes met with, who\r\nare ignorant even of the use of fire.\" Against the spontaneous\r\ngeneration of the human race in several localities he argues at length\r\nas an utter absurdity, the point of his argument being, that isolated\r\ncouples so produced would be unable to resist the inhospitality of\r\nnature without miraculous aid, and one miracle, he contends, is more\r\nadmissable than ten or a dozen. But the chief grounds upon which he\r\nlabors to establish his doctrine are the similitude of the most ancient\r\ntraditions among all branches of the human species, the affiliation and\r\nanalogy of languages, and the identity of organization and equality of\r\naptitudes. He finds similar traditions among the Hebrews, the Chaldeans,\r\nthe Phoenicians, the Egyptians, the Ethiopians, the Hindoos, the\r\nPersians, the Chinese, the Thibetans, the Scythians, and the Americans.\r\nIn the theogonies and cosmogonies of the Aztecs of America, he says that\r\nthe traditions of ancient Asia are plainly to be found, while some vague\r\ntraces of these primitive narratives are to be found even among the\r\nsavages of Oceanica, and the most barbarous and miserable negroes of\r\nwestern Africa. To the negroes he devotes perhaps the most careful and\r\nlearned portion of the work. Starting from the discovery of M. Flaurens\r\nas to the _pigmentum_ or coloring matter of the skin, he contends with\r\ngreat force that nothing but the gradual influence of climate, giving a\r\ngreater and greater intensity to the action of this coloring matter,\r\nwhich exists in every race and every individual, has caused the\r\nessential difference between whites and blacks. For, he argues, there is\r\nno other difference between them than that of color, all the other\r\nfeatures, such as the prominent mouth, the woolly hair, the facial\r\nangle, being in no wise exclusively peculiar to the Africans. And so,\r\nafter having gone over the entire race in detail, proving the identity\r\nof organization in every division, M. de Salles concludes that the\r\nprimitive complexion was olive, somewhat like the color of unburnt\r\ncoffee, and the original men had red hair. On the affiliation of\r\nlanguages he reasons at great length, with a striking affluence of\r\ncurious and learned detail. Languages, he remarks, become more and more\r\ncomplicated and perfect as we ascend toward their origin. Next he\r\nconsiders the modifications by which the present races of men have\r\ndeparted from the first family, and in so doing he takes up every people\r\nthat has ever been known. America, he thinks, was first settled by\r\nMongol emigration, with religious traditions, between the eighteenth and\r\nthe fifteenth century before our era: then, six or eight hundred years\r\nlater, there was a second emigration of Hindoo races, with traditions of\r\narchitecture. With the Bible and the facts of geology as his starting\r\npoint, he demonstrates the falsity of the Egyptian, Hindoo, Chinese, and\r\nMexican chronologies. The six days of creation he takes as so many great\r\nepochs; the deluge he places at five thousand years before Christ.\r\n\r\nIn our account of this book we have not strictly followed the order of\r\nthe author. Thus he makes the direct miraculous creation of man the\r\nconcluding topic of his book, and treats it not without a certain poetic\r\nelevation as comports with such an event. We have aimed only to give the\r\noutlines of his doctrine, and for the rest recommend those of our\r\nreaders who are interested in such studies to procure and read the work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOACHIM LELEWEL (a name honored by all lovers of liberty,) has just\r\npublished at Breslau a work on the geography of the middle ages, which\r\nis worthy of the warmest admiration.

While the Palatinate and the left bank\r\nof the Rhine were ravaged by the French armies, the fortress of\r\nRheinfels held out obstinately against a siege which was prosecuted with\r\nfury by a much superior force. Amid the scenes of this siege, passes the\r\nlove-story that forms the kernel of the novel, which is written with\r\noriginality and talent. The historical part is equally attractive and\r\n_vraisemblant_. A collection of romances under the title of _Germania_,\r\nhas appeared at Bremen. It is intended to serve as the beginning of an\r\nannual publication. The first number contains seven tales, some of them\r\nby well known romance writers. The first is _Eine Leidenschaft_ (A\r\nPassion), by Louise von G., and is highly praised by the most reliable\r\ncritics; it abounds in arch and graceful humor. Spiller von Hauenschildt\r\nis the least successful of the contributors in respect to the artistic\r\ntreatment of his subject. His novel is socialistic. Adolph Hahr and\r\nAlfred Meissner are also among the contributors. On the whole the book\r\nis a good one.\r\n\r\nLeopold Schefer has published lately in Berlin _The Bishop's Wife, a\r\nTale of the Papacy_, in which the great Napoleon of the church,\r\nHildebrand, figures as the hero. The Germans have never succeeded in the\r\nhistorical novel. With vast resources in materiel, they have always a\r\nvagueness, a want of definite interest, of picturesque arrangement, and\r\nof sustained and disciplined power. Schefer is a scholar, and his\r\ndidactic purpose is plain enough, and well enough managed. The Teutonic\r\ncharacter has always instinctively revolted against the practice of\r\ncelibacy, a form of ascetism quite natural, and sometimes perhaps\r\ninevitable, as a reaction against the unbridled sensualism of the\r\nAfricans and Asiatics, but quite out of place in climes so temperate and\r\nraces so moderate, conscientious, and self-respecting as those of\r\nNorthern Europe. It needed all the genius and determination of\r\nHildebrand himself to enforce the celibacy of the German clergy, and\r\ncertainly they have never ceased more or less covertly to revolt against\r\nit. It is well understood that, at the present time, there is a very\r\ngeneral wish among the Catholics of Germany--more especially of South\r\nGermany, where they are not jealous of Protestant encroachments--to have\r\nmarriage allowed to the parochial clergy; and the clergy themselves are\r\nforemost in this tendency, though it may not accord with their interest\r\nunreservedly to display it. It has, however, betrayed its existence in\r\nvarious ways, especially in anonymous literary productions, in prose and\r\nverse. So general is this feeling, and so profound the conviction that\r\nsomething must be done, that in 1848 it was very generally credited that\r\nthe Pope was prepared to sanction a relaxation of the laws of the church\r\nin this respect. For this belief, however, there could have been no\r\njust foundation, since Pius IX. is the reputed author of the official\r\nreply, made while he was but a priest, to the Brazilian Archbishop\r\nFeijo, upon this very subject, in which it was alleged that such a\r\nrelaxation of discipline would be an abandonment of the \"integrity of\r\nthe church.\" Yet without something of the kind, it is thought that a\r\nvery extensive schism in catholic Germany will be inevitable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Der Mensch im Spiegel der Natur_ (Man in the Mirror of Nature), is an\r\nexcellent little work for popular use, by Mr. E.

He was in the habit of noting every thing that passed\r\naround him, or with which he was connected, whether of a political,\r\nmilitary, or personal nature. His field of service extended throughout\r\nthe entire empire, and embraced the most important events in the reign\r\nof Peter the Great. He participated in the suppression of the corps of\r\nStrelitzes, made two campaigns against the Turks, was active in Peter's\r\nreorganization of the army, &c., &c. The first volume comes down to\r\n1678; the remainder will soon follow. As the whole was written without\r\nany design of being communicated to the world, it is especially valuable\r\nfor its glimpses at the domestic habits of the country at that peculiar\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGEORGE SAND'S NEW DRAMA.--George Sand's _Claudie_ has had a brilliant\r\nfortune at Paris, where it was first performed the second week in\r\nJanuary. It is a drama of peasant life, in three acts, in prose. Jules\r\nJanin says of it: \"The success of Claudie is a true, sincere, and\r\nenergetic success. It has impassioned the calmest souls; it has calmed\r\nthe most agitated. This poem is a veritable festival, full of the rustic\r\ndelights of the country, of the most honorable passions of the human\r\nheart, of the noblest sentiments. Add to this, a charm altogether new, a\r\ncharm both inspired and inspiring, in the style, which is reason and\r\ngood sense in the most delicious costume. Neither effort nor study is\r\nthere, but only that simplicity so much sought for in the most precious\r\npassages of _Daphnis and Chloe_ translated to the Marivaux by Amyot\r\nhimself. The piece was listened to with ravishment. There was universal\r\npraise among the audience, an inexpressible abundance of tears, of\r\nlaughter, of gayety, of sighs, of words fitly spoken, of eloquent\r\nsilence.\" Of the plot we take the following account from an article by\r\nPaul de Musset: From the beginning we feel the air of the country, the\r\nharvest, and the sun of August. Farmer Fauveau is preparing to pay the\r\nharvesters. His employer, Dame Rose, a young and pretty widow, has just\r\nreturned from the city, where she had been for a lawsuit. Fauveau, a\r\nshrewd but good-natured man, skilfully calls her attention to the sad\r\nand agitated air of his son, who is no doubt in love with some one, and\r\nwith whom can it be except his charming mistress? Dame Rose admits that\r\nSylvain Fauveau is a handsome fellow, and a good and intelligent\r\nworkman, who would manage affairs with discretion, but he would be\r\njealous of his wife. Jealousy, replies the old man, is a proof of love,\r\nand so Dame Rose begins to cherish the idea that Sylvain is in love with\r\nher. This is not true, but the old man has said it purposely. He\r\nsuspects Sylvain of being in love with Claudie, a simple laborer in the\r\nharvest field, without a penny, and gaining her living, with no other\r\nrelative than a grandfather of eighty, who may any day become a charge\r\nupon her little earnings. Claudie comes in from work with her\r\ngrandfather, and they ask for their pay, the harvest being finished, and\r\nit being six leagues to their home. They are paid, and Sylvain takes\r\ncare that they shall receive more than his father intends, and that they\r\nshall be invited to the harvest festival. Claudie aids in the\r\npreparations, and Sylvain, reproaching her tenderly for working after a\r\nday so fatiguing, takes from her the severer part of the duties she has\r\nundertaken. But she only replies in monosyllables, and does not turn her\r\neyes from the plates and other utensils she is engaged with. Sylvain,\r\ntroubled by this, withdraws, murmuring at her coldness and indifference.\r\nWe soon see the cause of this. A young peasant appears. It is the\r\nhandsome Denis Ronciat, the beau and cajoler of the village girls, who\r\nutters an exclamation of surprise. A brief explanation informs us that\r\nDenis was betrothed to Claudie when she was fifteen, that he had\r\ndeceived and abandoned her like a villain, leaving her a child, which\r\nhad since died. This explains the gloomy air of Claudie, her\r\nindifference to the advances of Sylvain, and her almost fierce\r\ndetermination never to marry. To complete his outrages, Denis boldly\r\navows his intention to marry Dame Rose, and offers money to her he has\r\nbetrayed, in order to bribe her to silence. The band of harvesters\r\nappears, bearing in triumph the last sheaf, adorned with flowers and\r\nribbons. The grandfather, Remy, full of joy, pronounces a discourse of\r\nrude and simple eloquence on the beneficence of Providence, and of the\r\nsun He causes to shine, after which a collection is proposed in favor of\r\nthe orator and his granddaughter. Every one gives his offering. Dame\r\nRose puts in a new five-franc piece, the father Fauveau a penny, Sylvain\r\nhis watch, wishing that it were his heart, a child brings an apple, and\r\nfinally the last contributor approaches. This is Denis Ronciat: seeing\r\nthe seducer of his child, the indignation of the old man breaks out, he\r\nrejects the offering, and falls as if struck with apoplexy, pronouncing\r\na sort of mysterious malediction, which freezes with horror all who hear\r\nit. In the second act Claudie is still at the farm, her grandfather\r\nhaving been sick there for two months. She has been engaged as a servant\r\nto the farmer Fauveau, but has not given the least hope to Sylvain, who\r\nhas been constant in his attentions. Dame Rose, in the mean time, has\r\nfallen in love with him, and is astonished that he has not declared\r\nhimself. Denis Ronciat, seeing his rival preferred, explains to the rich\r\nwidow why the lover she desires will not present himself, and from\r\nvengeance and vanity divulges the secret of poor Claudie. Here we expect\r\na storm of insults and reproaches to fall on the head of the dishonored\r\ngirl. But, as in the rest of the work, the author has laid aside the\r\nordinary traditions, customs, and conventionalities, to draw from the\r\nresources of her own genius. While all are preparing to expel the\r\ndomestic who has deceived every body by her air of candor and innocence,\r\nthe old man, whose reason has been wandering, listens. He recalls his\r\nrecollections, and his presence of mind returns at the critical moment.\r\nHe rises, throws his arms around his granddaughter, and naively recounts\r\nthe story of the seduction and abandonment of Claudie: how she believed\r\nin Denis, and gave him her heart without distrust; how Denis shamefully\r\nabused her confidence, and abandoned her, when duty obliged him more\r\nthan ever to be faithful. The old man adds that he himself had neither\r\nreproached nor cursed her, but that he consoled her, that he took her\r\nchild upon his knees, and loved it, and despaired when it died. Finally\r\nhe demands who would presume to be severer toward his child, and feel\r\nher wrong more keenly than he. His simplicity, magnanimity, and\r\ngoodness, overpower all who hear him. A more gentle sentiment than even\r\nrespect and pity takes possession of every heart. The devotion of the\r\nold man raises the fallen girl, and in the admiration he inspires the\r\nfault of Claudie is almost forgotten. But it is too late. The old man\r\ntakes the arm of his daughter, and leads her away with him. When the\r\ncurtain rises for the last scene, Dame Rose has retained Claudie and her\r\ngrandfather at the house, a riot in the village having prevented their\r\ndeparture. Denis has come near being stoned to death. Finally he\r\nconsents to repair his crime by marrying her he has betrayed. He is\r\nrefused. Then Sylvain offers himself to Claudie, but she says she is\r\nunworthy of him, and refuses obstinately. Dame Rose, Fauveau, and even\r\nSylvain's mother, try vainly to change her resolution. The old man at\r\nlast decides, by saying that he reads her soul, and knows that she loves\r\nSylvain. His authority makes her give a silent consent, and here the\r\ncurtain falls. _Claudie_ has been brought out in elegant form by a\r\nParisian publisher. Why should not some poet attempt a version into\r\nEnglish?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeveral new Plays and Operas have lately attracted attention in Paris.\r\n_Paillasse_, in five acts, by MM. Dennery and Marc Fournier, produced at\r\nthe _Gaiete_ in November, was one of the greatest hits during the latter\r\npart of 1850. The character of the conventional French mountebank,\r\nPaillasse, the vagabond juggler of fairs and streets, was regarded as\r\none of the finest creations of Frederic Lemaitre, and in one of the\r\nChristmas _revues_ a symbol of the piece passed before the eyes of the\r\naudience as one of the types of the past year. It has since been brought\r\nout in London with quite as much success, Madame Celeste (the quondam\r\nstar of our _Bowery_?) in the character of the wife of the mountebank.\r\nThe musical season at Paris has been signalized by the production of two\r\nsuccessful operas. _L'Enfante Prodigue_ of Auber is running a prosperous\r\ncareer at the _Academie de Musique_. General opinion speaks highly of\r\nthe music, and the piece appears to be one of the most ingenious of M.\r\nScribe. At the _Opera Comique_ another opera by Scribe and Halevy, _La\r\nDame de Pique_, has been brought out with success. The _libretto_, taken\r\nfrom a Russian tale, translated by M. Merimee, is one of the most\r\nfantastic Scribe has constructed. It is founded on an old story about\r\nthe Russian Empress Elizabeth, who had found out the secret of\r\ninvariably winning at play by means of three cards, of which the Queen\r\nof Spades (_la Dame de Pique_) was one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. COMBET, a Protestant clergyman of Cevennes, has just published at\r\nParis in three volumes a work of great interest and value, under the\r\ntitle of _Histoire de France sous le regne de Henry III. par Mazerai_.\r\nIt comprises a full, conscientious and philosophic account of the French\r\nreligious civil wars, from the beginning of the Reformation down to the\r\nestablishment of religious liberty under the Consulate. To the original\r\nwork of Mazerai, M. Combet has prefixed an elaborate introduction, while\r\nhe has added in the form of an appendix whatever relates to more recent\r\nmatters, with copious notes and commentaries. The whole constitutes an\r\ninvaluable contribution to the history of the modern religious movement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome new contributions to the history of labor have just appeared at\r\nParis. The most important is the _Histoire de la Classe ouvriere depuis\r\nl'esclave jusqu'au Proletaire de nos Jours_, by M. Robert (du Var), four\r\nvolumes. Less general and comprehensive in its aim is _Le Livre d'Or des\r\nMetiers, Histoire des Corporations ouvrieres_, by Paul Lacroix and Ferd.\r\nSerre, six volumes. Both these books are written without an intention to\r\nestablish any special theory or system.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE REV. G. R. GLEIG, author of _The Subaltern's Furlough, Saratoga_,\r\n&c., is now Inspector-General of Military Schools, and lives in London.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD RANKE, whose \"Lives of the Popes of Rome\" is familiar to\r\nAmerican readers, has lately discovered in the National Library at Paris\r\nan important long lost MS., by the Cardinal Richelieu. In the MS.\r\nmemoirs of the Cardinal, deposited at the Office for Foreign Affairs, an\r\nimperfection has existed, in the total absence of a series of leaves\r\nfrom the most interesting part of the collection. These appear to have\r\nbeen found accidentally, by M. Ranke, in a bundle of papers, gathered\r\nfrom some of the old mansions in Saint Germains. It has been a disputed\r\nquestion whether Richelieu was the real author of the works under his\r\nname; whether he availed himself of the literary abilities of others,\r\ncontributing no more from his own resources than here and there an\r\nobservation or a fact. These disputes have had reference to the Memoirs,\r\nthe Testament, and the _Histoire de la Mere et du Fils_; for there seems\r\nto be good reason for believing that the books published previous to his\r\npolitical elevation, such as the _De la Perfection du Chretien_, the\r\ntheological tracts, and his political treatise of 1614, were written by\r\nhim with no more than the ordinary aids of authorship. It is possible\r\nthat the fragment, discovered by M. Ranke, may afford additional\r\nevidence on this curious subject, which was lately debated in the\r\nAcademy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf _bad spelling_ George Sand writes, _apropos_ of some newspaper\r\ncontroversy in Paris, that so far from bad spelling being a proof of\r\nwant of capacity, she has a letter of Jean Jacques Rousseau, in which\r\nthere are ten faults of spelling in three lines. Moreover, she assures\r\nus, that she herself frequently makes a _lapsus pennae_ for which a\r\nschool-boy would be chastised.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLOLA MONTES has made her _debut_ in the literary arena, by the\r\npublication in the _feuilleton_ of a daily newspaper of the first\r\nportion of what she calls her \"Memoirs:\" a _quasi_-impertinent epistle\r\nto the ex-king of Bavaria. Since, the publication has been suspended. It\r\npromised merely scandal, without wit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE COUNT DE MONTALEMBERT has been elected a member of the French\r\nAcademy, in place of M. Droz. The election gives little satisfaction\r\noutside the Institute; but the Count is not without eminence as a man of\r\nletters. Some of his religious tracts are written with great eloquence\r\nand pungency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe seventh and last volume of the _Glossarium Mediae et Infimae\r\nLatinitatis_ has just been published by the Didots at Paris. It is a\r\nperfect repertory of information as to the middle ages, and cannot be\r\ndispensed with by any one who aims to study the institutions, history,\r\nand monuments of that period.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA complete grammar of the Coptic language has been brought out at\r\nBerlin, by Professor SCHWARTZE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIAN REVOLUTION.--Books relating to the late revolution in Italy\r\nand the events which preceded it are now published in that country in\r\nconsiderable numbers. One by Farini, _Lo Stato Romano dall' anno 1815\r\nall' anno 1850_, not yet completed, only two volumes having been\r\npublished, will be found valuable to the future historian. Its author is\r\na constitutionalist, and treats the reign of Pius IX. strictly from that\r\nstand-point. His book must therefore be read with discretion. With the\r\nthird volume, which will soon appear, will be issued a second edition of\r\nthe first two volumes. Marquis F. A. Gualtiero of Orvieto has just\r\nbrought out at Florence the first volume of a large work, _Gli Ultimenti\r\nRivolgimenti Italiani, Memorie Storiche con Documenti Inediti_. This is\r\nexcellent in respect to the pre-revolutionary events, giving a great\r\nvariety of information as to persons as well as circumstances, in\r\nconsiderable detail. It is to be followed by an account of the\r\nrevolution itself, treated of course in the same manner. It hardly need\r\nbe said that the Marquis must fail to do justice to Mazzini and the\r\nrepublicans. An elaborate and able article reviewing the whole question\r\nhas lately appeared in the _Rivista Italiana_, from the pen of Signor\r\nBerti. One of the best books yet produced on the revolutionary side is\r\nGeneral Pepe's _Guerres d'Italie_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe noticed last month the anniversary meeting of the Archaeological\r\nInstitute at Rome. The same society has just published its Annals, or\r\nAnnual Memoirs, for 1850, a volume of great value and interest. It\r\ncontains Lanza's report on the excavations at Salona, continued down to\r\nthe year 1848. An essay is contributed by Canina upon the three temples\r\nof Pietas, Spes, and Juno Sospita, on whose ruins is built the church of\r\nSan Nicola _in carcere_, new remains of the temples having been\r\ndiscovered in 1848. The statue of Apoxyomenos, found a year since at\r\nTrastavere, as well as the series of Amazons _in relievo_ now in the\r\nBritish Museum, which Emil Braun takes to be relics of the famous\r\nMausoleum, are treated at length. A little triangular candelabra, found\r\nin the Baths of Titus, is made interesting from the relation of the\r\nfigures upon it to the worship of Apollo. The series of Etruscan\r\nfrescoes has been greatly enriched by the pictures in two tombs, one of\r\nwhich was discovered in 1846 by A. Francois, while the other was then\r\nfor the first time copied and rescued from entire oblivion. These\r\npictures, which, like most monumental works, represent funeral feasts\r\nand games, according to Braun, are valuable for a mass of details\r\nrelating to antique athletic art, which were before unknown. A Pompeiian\r\nfresco, representing the twelve gods, hitherto little esteemed, is made\r\nthe subject of a profound investigation by E. Gerhard. Among the essays\r\non vases, a long one by Welcker deserves especial mention. It discusses\r\nall the known representations of the Death of Troilus. The sphere of\r\nnumismatics is filled by a long essay by Cavedoni on the Roman coins of\r\nthe time of Augustus. There are also many other articles of no less\r\ninterest to scholars, antiquaries, and artists.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM.

Abbadie's journey has just appeared in\r\nLondon, from the hand of Dr. Charles T. Beke, and it is not impossible\r\nthat the traveller will turn out a Damburger or a Hunter. Dr. Beke is an\r\nEnglishman; D'Abbadie, an Irishman by birth, but a Frenchman by name,\r\neducation and allegiance. The latter professes to have been the first\r\nEuropean who ever put foot in the African Kingdom of Kaffa; the former\r\ngives reasons for doubting his statements entirely, and does not believe\r\nthe Frenchman has even been in the country he describes at all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe great oriental scholar Monsignore MOLSA has been appointed to the\r\noffice of Chief Guardian of the Vatican Library, in the room of M.\r\nLaureani, whose melancholy death occurred a few months ago; and the\r\nAbate Martinucci has been nominated to fill the office of sub-chief,\r\nwhich is one of very considerable importance, and has hitherto been\r\nfilled by some of the most eminent of Italian scholars.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are to have from Paris a hitherto unpublished ode of PIRON, the\r\nwell-known author of _La Metromanie_.

His\r\nfather is proprietor of the _Nottingham Mercury_, and the editorial\r\ndepartment rests with him. He is a heavy, thick set sort of man; of a\r\nstature below the middle size; complexion dark; and, in years about\r\neight and thirty. His physiognomy would be clownish in expression, if\r\nhis eyes did not redeem his other features. He spoke of 'Festus,' and of\r\nits fame in America, of which he seemed very proud. In England, it has\r\nonly reached the third edition, while eight or nine have been published\r\nin the States. You know my opinion of the work. It is as far from being\r\na great poem as the Thames, compared with the Mississippi or the Ohio,\r\nis from being a great river. Anxiously, anxiously have I sought one\r\nstriking original idea in the whole poem (appalling in its length), but\r\nto no purpose. The transcendental literature of Germany absorbs all\r\nthat, at first glance, arrests the attention. Without learning,\r\nimagination, or the attraction of a beautiful metre (like that of\r\nTennyson's 'Princess'), I am at a loss to know what has given this poem\r\nits notoriety. Not its daring speculation, surely, for it is but a timid\r\ncompromise between Orthodoxy and Universalism.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nH. F.

Du Barry, U. S. N., has been\r\npublished in a large octavo of about five hundred pages, by Lippencott,\r\nGrambo, & Co., of Philadelphia. We take the opportunity to give some\r\naccount of the author.\r\n\r\nGuillaume Tell Poussin was born in the autumn of the year 1796 in the\r\ndepartment of the Seine and Oise, in France. His father was a painter of\r\nsome celebrity, who has left many fine works in the galleries of\r\nVersailles and Rouen. Introduced, while a child, to the favor of\r\nNapoleon, it was ordered by a special decree that, as a descendant of\r\nthe great Nicholas Poussin, whose works are among the chief glories of\r\nFrench art, William Tell Poussin should be educated at the imperial\r\nschool of Rouen. There he spent seven years, and passed his examination\r\nfor admission to the Polytechnic school. He entered this national\r\nacademy of engineering, and in 1814, while yet a youth, distinguished\r\nhimself by his patriotic spirit, which prompted him to join his comrades\r\nin the defence of the walls of Paris against an invading enemy. He was\r\nwounded at the village of Aubervilliers, in an attack against the\r\ncombined force of British and Russian troops who occupied that position;\r\nand after the surrender of Paris his feelings were so excited that he\r\ncould not bring himself to acts of submission to the Bourbon family, but\r\nwas arrested on account of his opinions, and released only on the\r\nintervention of powerful friends. He soon embarked for America, and\r\narrived at New-York in November, 1815, having for recommendation his\r\nardent desire to be useful and a decided love of liberty. After a short\r\nresidence in New-York he proceeded to Philadelphia, where he expected to\r\nmeet with some encouragement in his profession as an engineer. Here he\r\nbecame acquainted with Mr. Fairman, the engraver, and worked for him a\r\nfew months with advantage, boarding meanwhile at a French house, into\r\nwhich the landlady received him in consideration of the devotion of his\r\nleisure to the instruction of her children. The next spring he removed\r\nto Washington, where he had heard that he could be profitably employed\r\nin the rebuilding of the capitol, which the British army had destroyed\r\nin the late war. He now worked as an architect for about a year, when,\r\nseveral leading senators and representatives having become acquainted\r\nwith him, and, taking a particular interest in him for his earnest and\r\nmanly character and the remarkable abilities he had evinced as an\r\nengineer, in the incidental opportunities presented by his employment as\r\nan architect, they signed a petition to President Madison for his\r\nadmission to the corps of Topographical Engineers, which was then to be\r\norganized, and he was at once transferred to the United States Army. A\r\nshort time after, General Bernard, whom Mr. Crawford, the American\r\nMinister at Paris, had engaged to be the chief of the Topographical\r\nEngineers, arrived in Washington, and assuming his office proceeded to\r\nthe necessary preparations for that survey of the physical resources of\r\nour territory for national defence, and for tracing the lines required\r\nto form a complete base of operations in time of war, on the assailable\r\nportions of our frontier, for which the service had been instituted.\r\nBefore leaving France, General Bernard had received especial\r\nrecommendations from the friends of young Poussin to look after his\r\ninterests, and when they met, therefore, their acquaintance was made on\r\nthe most intimate and agreeable terms on both sides. Upon the\r\napplication of General Bernard to the Secretary of War, Poussin was\r\nattached to his person as an aid-de-camp, and left Washington with him\r\nfor a military reconnaissance of the coast on the Gulf of Mexico, and of\r\nthe delta of the Mississippi. They spent a year and a half upon their\r\nimportant duties, in New Orleans and its vicinity, regardless of the\r\ndangers of that climate, and in 1817 returned to the seat of government\r\nand submitted to the President a particular and elaborate memoir of\r\ntheir operations. It was upon this first report, presented by the\r\nExecutive, on the Military Defences of the United States,--a report\r\ndrawn up in a very large degree by the hand of M. Poussin, and\r\nillustrated throughout with his discovery and suggestion,--that\r\nCongress, by an almost unanimous vote, authorized the erection of the\r\ngreat line of our military defences, adopting the recommendations of the\r\ncommissioner without even the slightest alteration. The Board of\r\nMilitary Engineers entered subsequently on the yearly execution of their\r\nimportant duty of examining the coast previous to determining the actual\r\nsites and descriptions of the works of defence which they afterwards\r\ndelineated. The young topographical engineer continued in his arduous\r\nscientific labors, and thus contributed largely in the perfecting of\r\nthat great national scheme. It was in these military operations, and\r\nafterwards in the surveys for roads and canals, which, under the\r\nsupervision of a Board of Internal Improvements, where confided to a\r\nportion of the same officers, assisted by civil engineers, that Poussin\r\nrendered himself so efficient as a practical and scientific surveyor,\r\nand became so perfectly familiar with all the internal resources of our\r\nextensive country, which he had thus most remarkable opportunities to\r\nstudy and appreciate, by crossing it in all directions, and, in fact, by\r\nvisiting every state, and by following up and down every valley and\r\nriver of the eastern half of the continent. Few men have had such\r\noccasion of studying _de visu_ the extent and resources of the republic;\r\nand the intelligent readers of the volume before us will acknowledge,\r\nthat few persons have shown themselves more conversant with its\r\nastonishing advancement. His first publication was a description of the\r\nworks to which he had contributed, under the title of \"A History of the\r\nInternal Improvements of the United States;\" his second, an account of\r\nall the railroads in this country, which had considerable influence in\r\ndeveloping in Europe a disposition toward our policy in this respect,\r\nand entitles Major Poussin to the gratitude of all lovers of rapid and\r\nsafe communication. It was reproduced in Belgium and Germany, and has\r\nlong been a textbook upon its subject in those countries, as well as in\r\nFrance. His third work was the one now translated, _La Puissance\r\nAmericaine_, in which he has displayed, most emphatically, his\r\nadmiration of our institutions, and offered them as examples to\r\ncommunities aspiring after rational liberty. It may be said of it, that\r\nit is the American system rendered popular by practical and convincing\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\nMajor Poussin returned to France early in 1832, in the hope to cooeperate\r\nin rendering popular in his own country some of the political\r\ninstitutions of the United States, to which he always attributed our\r\ngreat prosperity; but he was not fortunate enough to be admitted to\r\nactive official life. He employed himself in his profession of surveyor,\r\nand superintended several important public works, and frequently in\r\npamphlets and in contributions to the journals, labored for the\r\ndissemination of American ideas. At last, when the Revolution of\r\nFebruary, 1848, broke out, he was chosen, with the greatest unanimity by\r\nthe Provisional Government, to be the Representative of Republican\r\nFrance near the Government of the United States. It was deemed the\r\nhighest compliment of which France was capable, that she sent as her\r\nminister the citizen most conversant with our affairs, and most eminent\r\nfor admiration of our institutions. His arrival in this country, and the\r\nmisunderstanding with the cabinet at Washington, which resulted in his\r\nrecall by President Bonaparte, cannot have been forgotten by the\r\nobservant reader. We believe that few who have carefully studied the\r\nconduct of Major Poussin in that affair, will be disposed, in the\r\nslightest degree, to censure him, while the entire history will readily\r\nbe consigned to oblivion by the American who is in any degree sensitive\r\nupon the subject of our national honor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGUILLAUMIN ET CIE, the well known Parisian publishers, are about to add\r\nto their _Collection des Principaux Economistes_ several American works\r\nin this department. One volume, at least, will be devoted to Henry C.\r\nCarey's masterly compositions, with a preface and commentaries; another\r\nvolume will be given to the Free Trade party, and will embrace the best\r\nthings of Mr. Walker, Mr. Raguet, Mr. Cardozo, Henry Middleton, Dr.\r\nWayland, &c.; and essays by Mr. Phillips, Horace Greeley, and other\r\nProtectionists, will probably constitute another. The _Collection_ now\r\nembraces Quesnay, Turgot, Dupont Nemours, Le Tronne, the Says, Galliani,\r\nde Montyon, Condillac, Lavoisier, Adam Smith, Hume, Ricardo, Malthus,\r\nBentham, and a dozen more. The only American name in the list is that of\r\nFranklin quoted in the first volume of the _Melanges_, edited by Daire\r\nand Molinari.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOSEPH GALES, of the _National Intelligencer_, has lately published\r\nseveral leading articles of such compactness and completeness, such\r\nweight and dignity, as distinguish only the greatest compositions in\r\nphilosophy and upon affairs. The intellectual force acting through the\r\npress of this country is habitually underrated. There are a dozen\r\njournals here which may be advantageously compared with any in Europe,\r\nwith the single exception of the _Times_. It would perhaps seem\r\ninvidious to point them out, from the greater number that are conducted\r\nwith ability and energy; but it will not be objected by any one who has\r\nthe right to express an opinion in the case, if we say that Mr. Gales is\r\nof the first rank of public men who have ever influenced or illustrated\r\nthe course of events by written eloquence or argument. The leading\r\narticles from his hand which in the last twenty-five years have appeared\r\nin the National Intelligencer, would fill many volumes; and if collected\r\nand so submitted to one view, they would astonish by their variety, by\r\nthe extraordinary resources of information which they evince, by their\r\nsoundness of logic, elevation of sentiment, and uniform adaptation to\r\ntheir several purposes. If they lack the pungent wit, and fiery energy\r\nof phrase, and adroitly venomous spirit of \"Junius,\" they have, with\r\ntheir nobler calmness and uniform candor, a far wider sweep, a subtler\r\napprehension of consequences, and a more statesmanlike aim and capacity.\r\nThe diction of \"Junius\" was calculated to arrest attention, by its\r\nglitter and strength, and by its freshness; for it was in style, after\r\nall, that he was most creative, and since his style has by imitation\r\nbecome familiar, it is for the mystery of their authorship only that his\r\nworks have continued eminence. As materials for history, and as\r\nsuggestive guides of policy, we have in American literature very few\r\nworks so important as the leading articles of Joseph Gales would\r\nconstitute, fitly arranged, and illustrated by such notes as he could\r\nreadily furnish, necessary now on account of the time since some of them\r\nwere originally printed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe REV. HENRY T. CHEEVER'S \"Whale and his Captors,\" (published last\r\nyear by the Harpers,) has been reprinted in London under the title of\r\n\"The Whaleman's Adventures in the Northern Ocean,\" with a highly and\r\njustly commendatory introduction by the Rev. W. Scoresby, D.D. F.R.S. We\r\nhave great pleasure in recording evidences of the popularity of such\r\nworks as Mr. Cheever's. They have a manly as well as a Christian spirit,\r\nand are needed to counteract the influences of the many infidel books in\r\nwhich the effects of the Christian civilization in the Island World are\r\nsystematically misrepresented. We learn that Mr. Cheever is now engaged\r\nupon \"The Autobiography of Captain Obadiah Conger,\" who was fifty years\r\na mariner from the port of New-York. He is editing the MS. of the\r\ndeceased sailor for the Harpers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. JOB R. TYSON, whose careful researches respecting the colonial\r\nhistory of Pennsylvania have illustrated his abilities and his\r\npredilections in this line, is about to proceed to Europe, for the\r\nconsultation of certain documents connected with the subject,\r\npreparatory to the publication of his \"History of the American\r\nColonies,\" a work in which, doubtless, he will not be liable to the\r\nreproach of histories written by New-Englanders, that they exaggerate\r\nthe virtues and the influence of the Puritans. Mr. Tyson is of the best\r\nstock of the Philadelphia Quakers, and the traditional fame of his party\r\nwill not suffer in his hands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. HENRY JAMES, the author of \"Moralism and Christianity,\" must\r\ncertainly be regarded by all who come into his fit audience as one of\r\nthe greatest living masters of metaphysics. Mr. James has never been\r\nmentioned in the _North American Review_; but then, that peculiarly\r\nnational work has not in all its seventy volumes an article upon\r\nJonathan Edwards, whom Robert Hall, Dr. Chalmers, Dugald Stuart, Sir\r\nJames Mackintosh, Kant, Cousin, and a hundred others scarcely less\r\nfamous, have regarded as the chief glory in our intellectual firmament;\r\nit has never let its light shine upon the pages of Legare; it has\r\npreserved the most profound silence respecting Henry Carey, William R.\r\nWilliams, and Addison Alexander; so that it must not be considered\r\naltogether conclusive as to Mr. James's merits that he has not had the\r\nseal of the _North American's_ approval. We regard him as one of the\r\ngreat metaphysicians of the time, not because, like Comte, he has\r\nevolved with irresistible power and majestic order any grand and\r\ncomplete system, but because he has brought to the discussion of the few\r\nquestions he has attempted, so independent a spirit, so pure a method,\r\nsuch expansive humanity, and such ample resources of learning, as\r\nseparately claim admiration, and combined, constitute a teacher of the\r\nmost dignified rank, who can and will influence the world. We do not\r\naltogether agree with Mr. James; on the contrary, we have been regarded\r\nas particularly grim in our conservatism; but we are none the less\r\nsensible of Mr. James's surpassing merits as a writer upon the\r\nphilosophy of society. We dedicate this paragraph to him on account of\r\nthe series of lectures he has just delivered in New-York, upon \"The\r\nSymbolism of Property,\" \"Democracy and its Issues,\" \"The Harmony of\r\nNature and Revelation,\" \"The Past and Future Churches,\" &c. We\r\nunderstand that these splendid dissertations will be given to the public\r\nin the more acceptable form of a volume. The popular lecture is not a\r\nsuitable medium for such discussions, or certainly not for such\r\nthinking: one of Mr. James's sentences, diluted to the lecture standard,\r\nwould serve for an entire discourse, which by those who should\r\nunderstand it, would be deemed of a singularly compact body, as compared\r\nwith the average of such performances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR TORREY, of the University of Vermont, is one of the few\r\ncontemporary scholars, whose names are likely to survive with those of\r\nthe great teachers of past ages. He has translated Schilling's Discourse\r\non Fine Arts, and other shorter compositions from the German; but his\r\nchief labor in this way is, a most laborious and admirably executed\r\nversion of Neander's History of the Christian Religion and Church,\r\npublished in Boston, and now being republished in London, by Bonn, with\r\nNotes, &c., by the Rev. A. T. W. Morison, of Trinity College, Cambridge.\r\n\r\nNeander has sometimes been called, but with scarcely sufficient reason,\r\nthe Niebuhr of ecclesiastical history. The only point in which he\r\nresembles the historian of Rome, is in that vast range of complete\r\nerudition which makes the Past in its minutest details as familiar as\r\nthe Present, which is never content with derivative information, but\r\ntraces back every tributary of the great stream of History to its\r\nremotest accessible source. In this respect the two eminent historians\r\nwere alike, but with this point of resemblance the similarity ends.\r\nNeander is entirely free from that necessity under which Niebuhr\r\nlabored, of regarding every recorded aggregate of facts as a mass of\r\nerror which the modern philosophy of history was either to decompose\r\ninto a myth, or reconstruct into a new form more consistent with\r\npreconceived theory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Works of JOHN C. CALHOUN will soon, through the wise munificence of\r\nthe state of South Carolina, be accessible by the students of political\r\nphilosophy and history in a complete and suitable edition, with such\r\nmemoirs as are necessary for their illustration, and for the\r\nsatisfaction of the natural curiosity respecting their illustrious\r\nauthor. The first volume will comprise Mr. Calhoun's elaborate\r\n_Disquisition on Government, and a Discourse on the Constitution and\r\nGovernment of the United States_, in which are displayed in a systematic\r\nmanner the author's opinions upon the whole subject of the philosophy of\r\ngovernment. These treatises were begun many years ago, and though they\r\nhad not received the ultimate revision which was intended, they are very\r\ncomplete, and by the careful and judicious editing of Mr. Cralle, his\r\nintimate friend and confidential secretary, will perhaps appear as\r\nperfect in all their parts as if re-written by Mr. Calhoun himself.\r\nThese are now nearly stereotyped; and to correct some misapprehensions\r\nwhich seem to prevail in South Carolina, we state that only the\r\nstereotype plates are made in New-York, there being no foundries for\r\nstereotyping in Charleston, where the book will be printed and\r\npublished. For this purpose the Legislature has appropriated $10,000,\r\nwhich will meet the expenses for fifteen thousand copies of the first\r\nvolume, all but five hundred of which, printed on large paper, for\r\npublic libraries, will be sold for the benefit of Mr. Calhoun's family.\r\nAnother volume will contain Mr. Calhoun's official papers, and another\r\nhis Letters upon Public Affairs. This, we think, will be the most\r\ninteresting of the series. Mr. Calhoun wrote always with sincerity and\r\nfrankness, and his communications to his friends contain, much more than\r\nhis speeches and state papers, the exhibitions of his feeling, his\r\nregrets, fears, expectations, and ambitions. His speeches will probably\r\nmake three volumes; the collection formerly printed by the Harpers did\r\nnot embrace half of them; many of them have never been printed at all,\r\nbut (particularly some of his most elaborate performances previous to\r\n1817) exist in carefully prepared manuscript reports. All these speeches\r\nwill be revised and illustrated by Mr. Cralle: and the series will be\r\ncompleted with the memoirs of the great senator, for which that\r\ngentleman has the most ample and interesting materials.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nARCHBISHOP WHATELEY'S very ingenious _Historical Doubts Respecting\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte_, is the cleverest book of the kind yet written, not\r\nexcepting the high church pamphlet treating of the Archbishop's own\r\nexistence in the same way. But the idea was not original with Whateley:\r\nMr. William Biglow of Boston wrote half a century ago, _The Age of\r\nFreedom, being an Investigation of Good and Bad Government, in Imitation\r\nof Mr. Paine's Age of Reason_, and intended, by a similar style of\r\nargument respecting the Discovery of America, &c., to expose that\r\ninfidel's sophistries. We perceive that the _Life of Jesus_, by Dr.\r\nStrauss, has been met by another such performance in England, under the\r\ntitle of _Historical Certainties respecting the Early History of\r\nAmerica, developed in a Critical Examination of the Book of the\r\nChronicles of the Land of Ecnarf; By the Rev. Aristarchus Newlight,\r\nDoctor of Philosophy of the University of Giessen, Corresponding Member\r\nof the Theophilanthropic and Pantisocratical Societies of Leipsig, late\r\nProfessor of all Religions in several distinguished Academies at Home\r\nand Abroad, &c_. The author very satisfactorily disposes of the events\r\nbetween the first French Revolution and the Battle of Waterloo, by\r\nputting them through the \"mythic\" circle invented by Dr. Strauss. The\r\njoke is carried out with remarkable ingenuity, and with the most\r\nwhimsical resources of learning. The good doctor finds, _a la Strauss, a\r\nnucleus_, for here and there a great tradition, but remorselessly wipes\r\nout as altogether incredible many of the most striking and familiar\r\nfacts in modern history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf Mr. SCHOOLCRAFT'S great work, which we have heretofore announced, the\r\nfirst part has just appeared from the press of Lippencott, Grambo & Co.,\r\nin the most splendid quarto volume that has yet been printed in America.\r\nWe shall take an early opportunity to do justice to this truly national\r\nperformance and to its author.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDR. ROBERT KNOX--whose book of infidel rigmarole, _The Races of Men_,\r\nwas lately reprinted by an American house which was never before and we\r\ntrust will never again be guilty of such an indiscretion,--we understand\r\nis coming to New-York to lecture upon Ethnology. He has the \"gift\" of\r\ntalking, and is said to have been popular as a demonstrator in anatomy;\r\nbut we think it will be best for him to remain a while longer in\r\nEngland; the sham science of which his last book is a specimen is no\r\nlonger, we believe, _profitable_ in this country. The last _Princeton\r\nReview_ says of _The Races of Men_:\r\n\r\n     \"This book is fairly beneath argument or criticism. It is a\r\n     curious medley of vanity, ignorance, malice, and fanaticism. At\r\n     first it provoked our indignation, by the boldness and\r\n     effrontery of its pretensions; but their very extravagance soon\r\n     began to render them comical. It claims to originate views\r\n     which are to overturn 'long received doctrines, national\r\n     prejudices, stereotyped delusions,' &c., while any tolerable\r\n     scholar in this department is perfectly familiar with them all\r\n     in the works of Virey, Courtet, Bory de St. Vincent, Edwards,\r\n     La Marck, Quetelet, &c. It has not the slightest claim to\r\n     originality, except for the ridiculous ingenuity, with which it\r\n     carries out the more cautious follies of these infidel\r\n     philosophers, into the most glaring absurdities; and sets their\r\n     ingenious physiological speculations, in broad contradiction to\r\n     the most authentic and unquestioned truths of history. We\r\n     certainly should not have noticed this thing at all, but for\r\n     two reasons. In the first place, this subject is now rendered\r\n     so interesting by the important bearings of modern ethnological\r\n     researches, that some of our readers might be cheated by the\r\n     mere title, and by newspaper puffs, out of the market price for\r\n     the book; and in the second place, we wish to express our\r\n     surprise and lift up our remonstrance against such issues from\r\n     a quarter so respectable as that which has given this reprint\r\n     to the American public. Whatever may be the social or\r\n     scientific standing of any influential publishing house, we\r\n     must say, that in our judgment they merit a deliberate rebuke\r\n     from the true science of the country, for reprinting so crude\r\n     and wretched a performance, to say nothing of the low malignity\r\n     which it vents against the Christian sentiment and enterprise\r\n     of an age like the present,--and even against men, who stand in\r\n     the front ranks of science, because they happen to believe that\r\n     the scriptures are entitled to some respect, as authentic\r\n     records; or that other races of men are capable of being\r\n     Christianized, beside the Teutonic. Cuvier was an ignorant and\r\n     stubborn dogmatist, whose era is now past for ever. Buckland\r\n     was an ingenious priest and Jesuit; and even Newton's brain was\r\n     turned by chronology.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR.

The _Literary World_ does not, we\r\nbelieve, pretend to be an authority in such matters, but that a\r\n\"historical society\" should receive such a gross imposition is somewhat\r\nsurprising. The letter is as much a forgery and imposture as the\r\n\"exceedingly interesting letter from General Washington to his wife,\"\r\npublished a few months ago in the _Day Book_. Without going into any\r\nfurther statement or argument on this subject, it may be sufficient to\r\nremark, that Washington was not within two hundred miles of Cambridge on\r\nthe 24th of June, 1776.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE REV.

WILLIAM W. LORD, then a\r\nresident graduate at Princeton College, published the volume of poems by\r\nwhich he was introduced to the literary world. That book had various and\r\nstriking merits, and though it had many defects in an artistic point of\r\nview, upon the whole it illustrated a just apprehension of the poetic\r\nprinciple, and such capacities for execution as justified the sanguine\r\nhopes it occasioned among his friends of his future eminence in the\r\nhighest and finest of the arts. From that time until the present, Mr.\r\nLord has not appeared as an author; but the leisure that could be\r\nwithdrawn from professional study has been devoted to the composition of\r\n\"_Christ in Hades_,\" (Appleton & Co.) a poem displaying his best\r\nabilities in art, while it is a suitable offering to religion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"It was my purpose,\" he says, \"in undertaking this work, to give poetic\r\nform, design, and history to the descent of Christ into hell; a fact\r\nthat has for so many ages attracted the curiosity of the human mind, as\r\nto furnish occasion for surprise that the attempt has not hitherto been\r\nmade. As regards the end for which He descended, I have adhered to the\r\nChristian tradition that it was to free the souls of the ancient saints\r\nconfined in the temporal paradise of the Under-world, embracing also in\r\nmy design the less general opinion, that it was to demonstrate His\r\nuniversal supremacy by appearing among the damned.\r\n\r\n\"A source of additional human interest was suggested by the relation\r\nwhich men, as a distinct order of beings, might be supposed to sustain\r\nto demons in the place of their common doom, and under new conditions of\r\nexistence; such, I conceived, as would make it possible in some degree\r\nto realize even the divine fictions of the Greek mythology, under the\r\nforms and with the attributes accorded them by ancient religions, and by\r\nthe poetry of all time. This could not fail to suggest the further\r\nconception of introducing the divinities of our forefathers, and of\r\nother great families of mankind, thus bringing together in action and\r\ncontrast the deified men, or various representatives of an heroic\r\nhumanity, among different races: nor did it seem too great a stretch of\r\nimaginative probability to conceive that their general characteristics\r\nmight be adopted and imitated by beings already invested by the human\r\nmind with an indefinite power, and inhabiting a world in which the\r\nwonderful becomes the probable.\r\n\r\n\"But it is, after all, the general purpose of exhibiting the triumph of\r\nmoral power over all physical and inferior spiritual force, in the\r\ndescent of Christ into hell, which gives my design the complex character\r\nof a mythic, heroic, and Christian poem, and, at the same time,\r\nconstitutes the unity of its parts. The ancients, whose representative\r\ntypes I introduce, knew and appreciated but two kinds of power, brute or\r\nphysical, and spiritual, including all occult and supernatural efficacy,\r\nand strength of intellect and will. Virtue, triumphant by the aid of\r\nadventitious force, or relying upon unconquerable pride and disdain to\r\nresist it, was the highest reach of their dynamic conceptions. Moral\r\npower is properly a Christian idea. It is not, therefore, without what I\r\nconceive to be a true as well as a poetic apprehension of the design of\r\nthe Descent into Hell, that the heroes of profane, and the not fabulous\r\nTitans of sacred antiquity, by their rivalries and contentions, brought\r\ntogether in arms for a trial of their comparative strength, are suddenly\r\nconfronted with a common and dissimilar antagonist, and 'all strength,\r\nall terror, single or in bands, that ever was put forth' opposed to that\r\nnovel, and, save in the Temptation, hitherto untested power, represented\r\nby Christ, the author of the theory and master of the example.\r\n\r\n\"He is not supposed to appear among them 'grasping in his hand ten\r\nthousand thunders,' but endued with an equal power, the result and\r\nexpression of perfect virtue and rightful authority. His triumph is\r\nattributed neither to natural, nor to supernatural power; but to moral\r\nsuperiority, evincing itself in His aspect, and exercising its\r\nomnipotence upon the soul and conscience. That in the conception of a\r\ngreat Christian poet, His appearance among the rebel angels in Heaven\r\nwas distinguished by the former attributes, is due, perhaps, to the\r\nheroic prejudice of a mind thoroughly imbued with the spirit of pagan\r\nwriters, and of the Hebrew Scriptures.\"\r\n\r\nThe volume opens with this noble invocation, in which there is fit\r\nrecognition of Dante and Milton, whose lips aforetime for such song had\r\nbeen touched by the divinest fire:\r\n\r\n      Thou of the darkness and the fire, and fame\r\n    Avenged by misery and the Orphic doom,\r\n    Bard of the tyrant-lay! whom dreadless wrongs,\r\n    Impatient, and pale thirst for justice drove,\r\n    A visionary exile, from the earth,\r\n    To seek it in its iron reign--O stern!\r\n    And not accepting sympathy, accept\r\n    A not presumptious offering, that joins\r\n    That region with a greater name: And thou,\r\n    Of my own native language, O dread bard!\r\n    Who, amid heaven's unshadowed light, by thee\r\n    Supremely sung, abidest--shouldst thou know\r\n    Who on earth with thoughts of thee erects\r\n    And purifies his mind, and, but by thee,\r\n    Awed by no fame, boldened by thee, and awed--\r\n    Not with thy breadth of wing, yet with the power\r\n    To breathe the region air--attempts the height\r\n    Where never Scio's singing eagle towered,\r\n    Nor that high-soaring Theban moulted plume,\r\n    Hear thou my song! hear, or be deaf, who may.\r\n\r\n      And if not rashly, or too soon, I heed\r\n    The impulse, but have waited on my heart\r\n    With patience, and its utterance stilled with awe\r\n    Oh what inspired it, till I felt it beat\r\n    True cadence to unconquerable strains;\r\n    Oh, then may she first wooed from heaven by prayer\r\n    From thy pure lips, and sympathy austere\r\n    With suffering, and the sight of solemn age,\r\n    And thy gray Homer's head, with darkness bound,\r\n    To me descend, more near, as I am far\r\n    Beneath thee, and more need her aiding wing.\r\n\r\n      Oh, not again invoked in vain, descend,\r\n    Urania! and eyes with common light\r\n    More blinded than were his by Heaven's hand\r\n    Imposed to intercept distracting rays,\r\n    Bathe in the vision of transcendent day;\r\n    And of the human senses (the dark veil\r\n    Before the world of spirit drawn) remove\r\n    The dim material hindrance, and illume;\r\n    That human thought again may dare behold\r\n    The shape and port of spirits, and once more\r\n    Hear voices in that distant, shadowy world,\r\n    To which ourselves, and this, are shadows, they\r\n    The substance, immaterial essence pure--\r\n    Souls that have freed their slave, and given back\r\n    Its force unto the elements, the dread\r\n    Manes, or the more dread Archetypes of men:\r\n    Like whom in featured reason's shape--like whom\r\n    Created in the mould of God--they fell,\r\n    And mixed with them in common ruin, made\r\n    One vast and many-realmed world, and shared\r\n    Their deep abodes--their endless exile, some,--\r\n    Some to return to the ethereous light\r\n    When one of human form, a Savior-Man\r\n    Almighty, not in deity alone,\r\n    But mightier than all angels in the might\r\n    And guard of human innocence preserved,\r\n    Should freely enter their dark empire--these\r\n    To loose, o'er those to triumph; this the theme,\r\n    The adventure, and the triumph of my song.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fine Arts.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEUTZE'S WASHINGTON CROSSING THE DELAWARE.--Our readers are aware of the\r\naccident by fire which happened some months since to Leutze's\r\nnearly-finished picture of Washington Crossing the Delaware, in\r\nconsequence of which he abandoned it to the underwriters, intending to\r\ncommence the work anew for the party from which he had received the\r\norder to paint it. The underwriters have accordingly paid the insurance,\r\nand are now exhibiting the picture in its incomplete state to the public\r\nof Cologne, where it meets with high approval. The _Koelnische Zeitung_\r\nsays of it: \"In this picture the artist has depicted the events of the\r\nhour in which the destiny of the Free States of North America was\r\ndecided for centuries through the boldness of their courageous and\r\nprudent leader. The means of continuing the war were almost exhausted;\r\nthe army threatened in a few days to dissolve itself; the cause of\r\nfreedom for that continent, with its inestimable consequences for\r\nancient Europe, would have been postponed, no one can tell how long,\r\nperhaps for ever. Then the great mind of Washington conceived what the\r\nmorally debased, reposing enemy thought impossible. He crossed the\r\nDelaware with his army in the night, amid masses of floating ice, and,\r\nin the twilight of morning, assailed the inactive camp on the other\r\nside. The picture reproduces the moment when the great general,--ahead\r\nof the mass of the army, which had also just embarked, and part of which\r\nare passing off from the shore, and part already struggling with the\r\ndriving ice,--is steering to the opposite shore in a small boat,\r\nsurrounded by eleven heroic figures, officers, farmers, soldiers, and\r\nboatmen. The tall and majestic form of the man in whose hands at that\r\nhour lay the fate of millions, rises from the group, standing slightly\r\nbent, forward, with one foot on the bottom of the boat, the other on the\r\nforward bench. His mild yet serious and commanding glance seems seeking\r\nto pierce the mist of the farther shore and discover the enemy, while\r\nintimations of the future grandeur of his country rise upon his mind.\r\nNothing of youthful rashness appears in the expression of this figure,\r\nbut the thoughtful artist has depicted the 'heart for any fate' of the\r\ngeneral and statesman in noble, vigorous, and faithful traits. And what\r\nan impulse moves through the group of his companions! Their thought is,\r\n'Forward, invincibly forward, for our country!' This is expressed in\r\ntheir whole bearing, in every movement, in the eyes and features of all.\r\nUnder the influence of this thought they command the raging elements, so\r\nthat the masses of ice seem to dissolve before the will and energy of\r\nthese men. This is a picture by the sight of which, in this weary and\r\nexhausted time, one can recover health and strength. Let none miss a\r\ndraught from such a goblet of nectar. And while we are writing this, it\r\noccurs to us that it was at this very hour seventy-four years ago, in\r\nthe ice-cold night, Washington crossed the Delaware. And amid the\r\nominous concatenation of events which the weak mind calls accident, but\r\nwhich the clear spirit, whose eye rests on the whole world, regards as\r\nthe movement of nature according to eternal laws, there rises from our\r\nsoul the ardent prayer that Germany may soon find her Washington! Honor\r\nand fame to the artist whose production has power to work upon the\r\nhearts and inflame the spirits of all that behold it!\"\r\n\r\nMessrs. Goupil & Co. have purchased the duplicate of this work, to be\r\ncompleted on the first of July, for seven thousand dollars. The picture\r\ndescribed was unfinished, and has been exhibited by the underwriters, to\r\nwhom it was given up after the fire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn Italian picture dealer in London named Campanari, lately bought for a\r\ntrifle a portrait which has proved to be a genuine Michel Angelo. It\r\nrepresents the famous Vittoria Colonna, wife of the Marchese Pescara,\r\nthe General of Charles V. She was herself distinguished as a poetess as\r\nwell as by the impassioned love and adoration of the great painter, who\r\nnot only took her portrait, but left behind him several sonnets in her\r\nhonor. Campanari, though himself confident of the genuineness of the\r\npicture, could not procure it to be recognized in England. Accordingly\r\nhe sent it to Rome, where the Academy of San Luca, with Minardi at its\r\nhead, unanimously decided in its favor. In fact, it contains a grandeur\r\nand sublimity which could be ascribed to nobody but the author of the\r\nprophets and sibyls of the Sistine Chapel. An antique repose is\r\ndisplayed in the whole work, perfectly agreeing with the character of\r\nthe lady as described by Michel Angelo, and which suits the advanced age\r\nat which she is painted. The execution is like that of the picture in\r\nthe Florentine Tribune, in the wonderful facility of its execution. In\r\nthe coloring a carnation hue is remarkable, like that in Michel Angelo's\r\nRoman works. The hands of the figure are thought to be by some other\r\nartist. Only the head and part of the person seem to be by the author.\r\nThe picture has suffered little from time, some parts having apparently\r\nbeen repaired by a later pencil. It is valued at $30,000.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE MUNICH ART-UNION gives to its subscribers for the next year a\r\n_galvanograph_ of Rubens' Columbus. This is the first time that\r\ngalvanography has been applied to such a purpose. The plate from which\r\nthe print is taken has been copied by the galvanoplastic process, so\r\nthat it can serve for other art-unions also. For 1851 the Munich Union\r\nhas decided on engraving four Greek landscapes by C. Rottman. These\r\nplates will also be copied by the same process, and may be had at much\r\nless than the cost of original plates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOETHE'S OPINION OF BYRON, SCOTT, AND CARLYLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. John Oxenford, who has shown remarkable capacities for\r\nappropriation, in the use he has made of the labors of William Peter,\r\nParke Godwin, and others, in his various \"translations\" from the German,\r\nhas recently fallen in with Margaret Fuller d'Ossoli's version of the\r\n_Conversations of Goethe with Eckermann_, published many years ago by\r\nMr. Ripley in his \"Specimens of Foreign Literature;\" and the result is\r\ntwo volumes, embracing, with what Margaret Fuller translated, the great\r\npoet's conversations with Soret. Among the chief notable men who existed\r\nat the time of the conversations, and to whom reference is made, are\r\nScott and Byron. The first, whose _Fair Maid of Perth_ is read as a new\r\nbook, is praised for his \"objective\" qualities. The second is pronounced\r\nthe greatest modern poet of England, but censured for his polemic\r\ntendency. Goethe's rapture is kindled when he speaks of him:\r\n\r\n     \"'Lord Byron,' said Goethe, 'is to be regarded as a man, as an\r\n     Englishman, and as a great talent. His good qualities belong\r\n     chiefly to the man, his bad to the Englishman and the peer, his\r\n     talent is incommensurable. All Englishmen are, as such, without\r\n     reflection, properly so called; distractions and party spirit\r\n     will not permit them to unfold themselves in quiet. But they\r\n     are great as practical men. Thus, Lord Byron could never attain\r\n     reflection on himself, and on this account the maxims in\r\n     general are not successful, as is shown by his creed, 'much\r\n     money, no authority,' for much money always paralyzes\r\n     authority. But where he will create, he always succeeds; and we\r\n     may truly say that with him inspiration supplies the place of\r\n     reflection. He was always obliged to go on poetizing, and then\r\n     every thing that came from the man, especially from his heart,\r\n     was excellent. He produced his best things, as women do pretty\r\n     children, without thinking about it or knowing how it was done.\r\n     He is a great talent, a born talent, and I never saw the true\r\n     poetical power greater in any man than in him. In the\r\n     apprehension of external objects, and a clear penetration into\r\n     past situations, he is quite as great as Shakspeare. But as a\r\n     pure individuality, Shakspeare is his superior. This was felt\r\n     by Byron, and on this account he does not say much of\r\n     Shakspeare, although he knows whole passages by heart. He would\r\n     willingly have denied him altogether, for Shakspeare's\r\n     cheerfulness is in his way, and he feels that he is no match\r\n     for it. Pope he does not deny, for he had no cause to fear him.\r\n     On the contrary, he mentions him, and shows him respect when he\r\n     can, for he knows well enough that Pope is a mere foil to\r\n     himself.'...\r\n\r\n     \"Goethe seemed inexhaustible on the subject of Byron, and I\r\n     felt that I could not listen enough. After a few digressions,\r\n     he proceeded thus: 'His high rank as an English peer was very\r\n     injurious to Byron; for every talent is oppressed by the outer\r\n     world,--how much more, then, when there are such high birth and\r\n     so great a fortune. A certain middle rank is much more\r\n     favorable to talent, on which account we find all great artists\r\n     and poets in the middle classes. Byron's predilection for the\r\n     unbounded could not have been nearly so dangerous with more\r\n     humble birth and smaller means. But as it was, he was able to\r\n     put every fancy into practice, and this involved him in\r\n     innumerable scrapes. Besides, how could one of such high rank\r\n     be inspired with awe and respect by any rank whatever? He spoke\r\n     out whatever he felt, and this brought him into ceaseless\r\n     conflict with the world. It is surprising to remark,' continued\r\n     Goethe, 'how large a portion of the life of a rich Englishman\r\n     of rank is passed in duels and elopements. Lord Byron himself\r\n     says, that his father carried off three ladies. And let any man\r\n     be a steady son after that. Properly speaking, he lived\r\n     perpetually in a state of nature, and with his mode of\r\n     existence the necessity for self-defence floated daily before\r\n     his eyes. Hence his constant pistol-shooting. Every moment he\r\n     expected to be called out. He could not live alone. Hence, with\r\n     all his oddities, he was very indulgent to his associates. He\r\n     one evening read his fine poem on the Death of Sir John Moore,\r\n     and his noble friends did not know what to make of it. This did\r\n     not move him, but he put it away again. As a poet, he really\r\n     showed himself a lamb. Another would have commended them to the\r\n     devil.'\"\r\n\r\nYet Goethe had a curious theory in respect to criticism, and believed it\r\npossible for a foreigner to understand the achievements of a language\r\nnot his own better than those to whom it is native--in which we think he\r\nwas partially correct. In the following he criticises CARLYLE.\r\n\r\n     \"'Sit down,' said he, 'and let us talk awhile. A new\r\n     translation of Sophocles has just arrived. It reads well, and\r\n     seems to be excellent; I will compare it with Solgar. Now, what\r\n     say you to Carlyle?' I told him what I had been reading upon\r\n     Fonque. 'Is not that very good?' said Goethe. 'Aye, there are\r\n     clever people over the sea, who know us and can appreciate\r\n     us?... We are weakest in the aesthetic department, and may wait\r\n     long before we meet such a man as Carlyle. It is pleasant to\r\n     see that intercourse is now so close between the French,\r\n     English, and Germans, that we shall be able to correct one\r\n     another. This is the greatest use of a world-literature, which\r\n     will show itself more and more. Carlyle has written a life of\r\n     Schiller, and judged him as it would be difficult for a German\r\n     to judge him. On the other hand, we are clear about Shakspeare\r\n     and Byron, and can, perhaps, appreciate their merits better\r\n     than the English themselves.\"\r\n\r\nCarlyle is frequently referred to, and always thus. The clear-sighted,\r\ngreat old man, already perceives how much his fame will owe to such an\r\napostle and preacher of his faith--for he sees also what Carlyle himself\r\nwill become. The mention of Lockhart is also very interesting.\r\n\r\n     \"I asked about Lockhart, and whether he still recollected him.\r\n     'Perfectly well!' returned Goethe. 'His personal appearance\r\n     makes so decided an impression that one cannot easily forget\r\n     him. From all I hear from Englishmen, and from my\r\n     daughter-in-law, he must be a young man from whom great things\r\n     in literature are to be expected. I almost wonder that Walter\r\n     Scott does not say a word about Carlyle, who has so decided a\r\n     German tendency that he must certainly be known to him. It is\r\n     admirable in Carlyle that, in his judgment of our German\r\n     authors, he has especially in view the mental and moral core\r\n     as that which is really influential. Carlyle is a moral force\r\n     of great importance. There is in him much for the future, and\r\n     we cannot foresee what he will produce and effect.'\"\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n     \"'It is pleasant to see,' said Goethe, 'how the earlier\r\n     pedantry of the Scotch has changed into earnestness and\r\n     profundity. When I recollect how the 'Edinburgh Reviewers'\r\n     treated my works not many years since, and when I now consider\r\n     Carlyle's merits with respect to German literature, I am\r\n     astonished at the important step for the better. In Carlyle,'\r\n     said he, 'I venerate most of all the mind and the character\r\n     which lie at the foundation of his tendencies. The chief point\r\n     with him is the culture of his own nation; and, in the literary\r\n     productions of other countries, which he wishes to make known\r\n     to his contemporaries, he pays less attention to the arts of\r\n     talent, than to the moral elevation which can be attained\r\n     through such works. Yes,' said Goethe, 'the temper in which he\r\n     works is always admirable. What an earnest man he is! and how\r\n     he has studied us Germans! He is always more at home in our\r\n     literature than ourselves. At any rate we cannot vie with him\r\n     in our researches in English literature.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. KELLOGG'S EXPLORATION OF MT. SINAI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last volume of _Bohn's Illustrated Library_ (published in New-York\r\nby Bangs & Brother), is \"Scripture Lands, Described in a Series of\r\nHistorical, Geographical, and Topographical Sketches,\" by JOHN KITTO,\r\nD.D., F.S.A., the well-known author of the Dictionary of the Bible, &c.\r\nIt embraces, in a convenient and condensed form, results of the most\r\nimportant recent investigations by travellers and scholars in the\r\ncountries sacred for their connection with the history of true religion.\r\nWith other things by Americans, Dr. Kitto gives a prominent place to Mr.\r\nMINER K. KELLOGG'S account of Mt. Sinai, which we reprint below; and we\r\ncannot let the opportunity pass unimproved, of expressing a hope that\r\nMr. Kellogg will prepare for the press the voluminous notes which we\r\nknow him to possess of his various and interesting travels in the\r\nancient world, which he saw with the eye of an artist, the head of a\r\nscholar, and the heart of a Christian. If he would, he might give us a\r\nmost delightful and instructive book upon the East, and one that would\r\nbe eminently popular, though Asia has been of all the continents the\r\nmost frequently described. Dr. Kitto says:\r\n\r\n\"At the foot of the pass which leads up to the sacred shrine beneath the\r\nawful mount, from whose summit Jehovah proclaimed his law to the\r\ntrembling hosts of Israel, Dr. Robinson says,--'We commenced the slow\r\nand toilsome ascent along the narrow defile, about south by east,\r\nbetween blackened, shattered cliffs of granite, some eight hundred feet\r\nhigh, and not more than two hundred and fifty yards apart, which every\r\nmoment threatened to send down their ruins on our heads. Nor is this at\r\nall times an empty threat; for the whole pass is filled with large\r\nstones and rocks, the _debris_ of these cliffs. The bottom is a deep and\r\nnarrow water-course, where the wintry torrent sweeps down with fearful\r\nviolence. A path has been made for camels, along the shelving rocks,\r\npartly by removing the topmost blocks, sometimes in the manner of a\r\nSwiss mountain-road. But though I had crossed the most rugged passes of\r\nthe Alps, and made from Chamouni the whole circuit of Mont Blanc, I had\r\nnever found a path so rude and difficult as that we were now ascending.'\r\n\r\n\"After toiling along for nearly two hours, our travellers continue their\r\nnarrative:\r\n\r\n\"'Here the interior and lofty peaks of the great circle of Sinai began\r\nto open upon us--black, rugged, desolate summits; and, as we advanced,\r\nthe dark and frowning front of Sinai itself (the present Horeb of the\r\nmonks) began to appear. We were gradually ascending, and the valley\r\ngradually opening; but as yet all was a naked desert. Afterwards, a few\r\nshrubs were sprinkled round about, and a small encampment of black tents\r\nwas seen on our right, with camels and goats browsing, and a few donkeys\r\nbelonging to the convent. The scenery through which we had now passed\r\nreminded me strongly of the mountains around the Mer de Glace in\r\nSwitzerland. I had never seen a spot more wild and desolate.\r\n\r\n\"'As we advanced, the valley still opened wider and wider with a gentle\r\nascent, and became full of shrubs and tufts of herbs, shut in on each\r\nside by lofty granite ridges, and rugged, shattered peaks, a thousand\r\nfeet high, while the face of Horeb rose directly before us. Both my\r\ncompanion and myself involuntarily exclaimed, \"here is room enough for a\r\nlarge encampment!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Reaching the top of the ascent or watershed, a fine broad plain lay\r\nbefore us, sloping down gently towards the south-south-east, inclosed by\r\nrugged and venerable mountains of dark granite, stern, naked, splintered\r\npeaks, and ridges of indescribable grandeur; and terminated, at a\r\ndistance of more than a mile, by the bold and awful front of Horeb,\r\nrising perpendicularly in frowning majesty, from twelve to fifteen\r\nhundred feet in height. It was a scene of solemn grandeur, wholly\r\nunexpected, and such as we had never seen; and the associations which at\r\nthe moment rushed upon our minds were almost overwhelming.'\r\n\r\n\"They subsequently ascended the frowning summit of Horeb, and sketched\r\nthe scene from that point:--'The whole plain, er-Rahah, lay spread out\r\nbeneath our feet, with the adjacent wadys and mountains; while Wady\r\nesh-Sheikh on the right, and the recess on the left, both connected with\r\nand opening broadly from er-Rahah, presented an area which serves nearly\r\nto double that of the plain.\r\n\r\n\"'Our conviction was strengthened that here, or on some of the adjacent\r\ncliffs, was the spot where the Lord \"descended in fire,\" and proclaimed\r\nthe law. Here lay the plain where the whole congregation might be\r\nassembled; here was the mount that could be approached, if not\r\nforbidden; and here the mountain brow, where alone the lightning and the\r\nthick cloud would be visible, and the thunders and the voice of the\r\ntrump be heard, when the Lord \"came down in the sight of all the people\r\nupon Mount Sinai.\"\r\n\r\n\"'We gave ourselves up to the impressions of the awful scene; and read,\r\nwith a feeling that will never be forgotten, the sublime account of the\r\ntransactions, and the commandments there promulgated, in the original\r\nwords as recorded by the great Hebrew legislator.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Other travellers have explored a valley on the southern base of Sinai,\r\nwhich was shut out from the view of Dr. Robinson in his ascent by a long\r\nridge of rocks, and which has been found, by measurement of Krafft and\r\nStrauss, and others, to be even greater than the valley of er-Rahah on\r\nthe north. This, it is supposed by Ritter and others, may have been\r\noccupied by the Israelites at the giving of the Law. The locality of\r\nthis tremendous scene may perhaps be determined by future researches.\r\n\r\n\"An American artist and scholar, Mr. M. K. Kellogg, has lately given an\r\ninteresting account of this valley, which appears to be much more\r\nextensive than er-Rahah, and better suited for the accommodation of the\r\nimmense camp of Israel. To reach this station, the Israelites must have\r\ncontinued their march much further down the coast than on the other\r\nsupposition, and turned at a bolder angle up into the mountains near the\r\nmodern town of Tur or Tor. Dophkah, Alush, and Rephidim, must also, on\r\nthis supposition, be transferred to other localities corresponding with\r\nthis supposed line of march.\r\n\r\n\"If there be such a valley at the southern base of Sinai, it seems very\r\nextraordinary that it should have escaped the notice of travellers. It\r\nmust be visible from the summit of Sinai (Jebel Musa); but, seen only\r\nfrom that lofty summit, and running in an irregular line at the very\r\nbase of the mountain, they must have overlooked it in their brief survey\r\nof the scenery, so grand, so gloomy and peculiar, which there engaged\r\ntheir contemplation. The subject, however, is so curious and\r\ninteresting, that we insert in some detail the narrative of the American\r\ntraveller to which these remarks refer.\r\n\r\n\"'Having read a letter which appeared in the _Literary World_[F] of the\r\n20th November, from Dr. Ritter to Dr. Robinson, in which it is said that\r\nLaborde, in his _Commentary_ \"has now for the first time established the\r\nplain of Wady Sebaiyeh at the southern base of Sinai;\" and that this\r\n\"furnishes an important point for the elucidation of the giving of the\r\nLaw,\" I have been induced to submit to the consideration of the public,\r\nsome of the notes from a journal which I kept during my travels in that\r\nregion in the spring of 1844.[G]\r\n\r\n\"'Although I have not yet seen the Commentaries of Laborde, and\r\ntherefore cannot judge of their correctness in regard to this plain, yet\r\nI am happy in being able to furnish some testimony as to its existence\r\nand extent. Within the last few years a question has arisen as to the\r\nexistence of a plain in front of Mount Sinai, capable of containing the\r\nmultitude of Israelites who were to receive the commandments.\r\n\r\n\"'Dr. Robinson is the first, I believe, who has attempted to prove that\r\nno such plain exists. In his _Researches_ he finds a plain at the\r\nnorth-east extremity of the mountain called er-Rahah, which he says was\r\n\"the plain where the congregation of Israel were assembled,\" and that\r\nthe mountain impending over it, the present Horeb, was \"the scene of the\r\nawful phenomena in which the Law was proclaimed.\"\r\n\r\n\"'He says he was satisfied, after much inquiry, \"that in no other\r\nquarter of the peninsula, and certainly not around any of the higher\r\npeaks, is there a spot corresponding in any degree, so fully as this, to\r\nthe historical account, and to the circumstances of the case.\" Starting\r\nupon the hypothesis that there is no other plain than the one he\r\ndescribes, he has been obliged to give the name of Sinai to one of the\r\npeaks which overlook this plain, in order that the Israelites might\r\nwitness the awful ceremonies attending the promulgation of the Law which\r\ntook place upon the holy mountain. If this hypothesis is founded on\r\ntruth, then tradition is at fault, which has given to another part of\r\nthis region the name of Sinai, and a capacious plain beneath it; we must\r\nthrow aside all our faith in such tradition, and commence investigations\r\nwhich shall elicit the whole truth upon the subject.\r\n\r\n\"'As many late travellers have been led into error respecting the\r\ntopography of this district, by adopting, without investigation, the\r\nconclusions of Dr. Robinson, I feel it to be a duty to lay before you\r\nsuch facts as may be of service to those who shall hereafter journey\r\ninto the wilderness of Sinai.\r\n\r\n\"'On the 6th day of March, 1844, my two companions set out from the\r\nconvent at Mount Sinai, for the purpose of ascending the mountain St.\r\nCatharine. I declined going with them, partly through indisposition, and\r\npartly because I thought I could spend the day more usefully in making\r\nsketches in the neighboring convent. After my friend's departure with\r\nthe guides, I took a little Arab boy with me to carry my sketch-book and\r\nwater-bottle, and walked up Wady Shueib, until I came to the little\r\nMountain of the Cross (Neja), which almost shuts up the passage into\r\nWady Sebaiyeh, and where I had, for the first time, a view of the\r\nsouthern face of Mount Sinai. Here opened an extended picture of the\r\nmountains lying to the south of the Sinaite range, for I was now some\r\nthree hundred feet above the adjacent valleys.\r\n\r\n\"'After much difficulty, I succeeded in climbing over immense masses of\r\ngranite, to the side of the Mountain of the Cross, which I ascended\r\nabout five hundred feet on its south-western face, in order to obtain a\r\ngood view of the peak of Sinai, which I was anxious to sketch. Here,\r\nclose at my right, arose, almost perpendicularly, the Holy Mountain; its\r\nshattered pyramidal peak towering above me some 1400 feet, of a brownish\r\ntint, presenting vertical strata of granite, which threw off the\r\nglittering rays of the morning sun. Clinging around its base was a range\r\nof sharp, upheaving crags, from one hundred to two hundred feet in\r\nheight, which formed an almost impassable barrier to the mountain itself\r\nfrom the valley adjoining. These crags were separated from the mountain\r\nby a deep and narrow gorge, yet they must be considered as forming the\r\nprojecting base of Sinai.\r\n\r\n\"'Directly in front of me was a level valley, stretching onward to the\r\nsouth for two or three miles, and inclosed on the east, west, and south\r\nby low mountains of various altitudes, all much less, however, than that\r\nof Sinai. This valley passed behind the Mountain of the Cross to my\r\nleft, and out of view, so that I could not calculate its northern extent\r\nfrom where I stood. The whole scene was one of inexpressible grandeur\r\nand solemnity, and I seated myself to transfer some of its remarkable\r\nfeatures to the pages of my portfolio.\r\n\r\n\"'I remained at work until nearly sunset, when I discovered people\r\ncoming towards me through the dark ravine between the mountain of Sinai\r\nand the craggy spurs which shoot up around its base. I feared they might\r\nprove to be unfriendly Arabs; but, as they came nearer I discovered them\r\nto be my companions and their guides, who were returning from Mount St.\r\nCatharine. As the shades of evening were approaching, I shut up my\r\nportfolio, and descending the hillside, I joined my friends, and we\r\nreturned together to the convent. After dinner, they desired to see what\r\nI had done during the day, and my sketch-book was opened to them. They\r\nremarked, on seeing the drawing I had made, that as there was no plain\r\non the southern border of the mountain, I might as well have left out\r\nthe one seen in the drawing. After my assurance that I had copied what\r\nwas before me, they laughed, and remarked that none but a painter's\r\nimagination could have seen the plain in question, for they had passed\r\nentirely around the mountain that day, and could assert _positively_\r\nthat there was no such plain. Here was a difference of opinion\r\ncertainly, and one that I did not relish much, as it might at some\r\nfuture time be the means of creating a doubt as to the faithfulness of\r\nmy eastern drawings. I begged them, therefore, to accompany me the next\r\nday to that side of the mountain, and be convinced of what I told them.\r\nThey remarked that all authority was against me, and time was too\r\nprecious to go over the same ground twice.'\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems that one of them, however, accompanied the writer in his\r\nfurther exploration of the ensuing day, for he uses the plural number,\r\nand speaks of his 'friend.' We thus condense his statements: One day\r\n(7th March) is described as having been spent in Wady es-Sabaiyeh, or\r\nthe plain before Mount Sinai. After having penetrated into this wady, he\r\nsays: 'We took our course along the base of Jebel Deir, until we came to\r\na point whence the peak of Sinai was no longer visible, because of the\r\nintervening point of Jebel Deir; then striking across Sebaiyeh to the\r\nright, keeping Sinai in view, we stopped to contemplate the scene. Here\r\nthe plain is very wide, and forms one with Wady Sedout, which enters it\r\nfrom the south-east at a very acute angle, and in the whole of which\r\nSinai is plainly visible. These two wadys make a width of at least the\r\nthird of a mile. The hills rising from the east and south of Sebaiyeh,\r\nin front of Sinai, are of gentle ascent, upon which flocks might feed,\r\nand the people stand in full view of Sinai. For many miles, perhaps six\r\nor more, on the eastern border of this plain, are seen many small plains\r\nhigh up among the hills, from all of which Sinai is plainly visible.\r\nNear where we stood, a high, rocky platform of granite arose from the\r\nplain, upon which I seated myself, and took a sketch of the valley to\r\nits junction with Wady esh-Sheikh on the north, where stands _Jebel\r\nFureia_, a very conspicuous and singular mountain. At this point, Wady\r\nSheikh turns from its eastern course, after leaving Wady Rahah, and runs\r\nnorth around Jebel Fureia, where it receives Sebaiyeh from the south,\r\nand with it forms one unbroken plain for about twelve miles to the north\r\nof the place where I was seated. Turning back now to the south, we\r\ntraversed the plain towards the base of Sinai. The wady grew gently\r\nnarrower as we approached Neja, whose base projected far into the plain,\r\nand whose head shuts off the view of Sinai for a distance of about\r\none-half the width of the plain at its base.\r\n\r\n\"'As we passed its foot, Sinai again appeared, and we measured the plain\r\nnear the pathway which leads up towards Sinai on the southern border of\r\nNeja, and which appears to be the only entrance to the Holy Mountain.\r\nThe measured width here was four hundred and thirty feet. Passing on\r\nthree hundred and forty-five paces, we arrived at the narrowest part of\r\nthe plain, some few yards narrower than where we had measured it. This\r\nmay be considered as an entrance-door to the plain, which lies directly\r\nin front of Sinai, which now spreads out level, clear, and broad, going\r\non to the south with varied widths for about three miles on gently\r\nascending ground, where it passes between two sloping hills and enters\r\nanother wady which descends beyond, from which it is most probable Sinai\r\nmay yet be clearly seen.\r\n\r\n\"'On the east, this plain of Sebaiyeh is bounded by mountains having\r\nlong, sloping bases, and covered with wild thyme and other herbs,\r\naffording a good tenting-ground immediately fronting Sinai, which forms,\r\nas it were, a grand pyramidal pulpit to the magnificent amphitheatre\r\nbelow. The width of the plain immediately in front of Sinai is about\r\n1600 feet, but further south the width is much increased, so that on an\r\naverage the plain may be considered as being nearly one-third of a mile\r\nwide, and its length, in view of Mount Sinai, between five and six\r\nmiles. The good tenting-ground on the mountain sides mentioned above,\r\nwould give much more space for the multitude on the great occasion for\r\nwhich they were assembled. This estimate does not include that part of\r\nthe plain to the north, and Wady esh-Sheikh, from which the peak of\r\nSinai is not visible; for this space would contain three or four times\r\nthe number of people which Sebaiyeh would hold.\r\n\r\n\"'From Wady Sebaiyeh we crossed over the granite spurs, in order to pass\r\naround the southern border of Sinai into Wady Lejah. These spurs are of\r\nsufficient size to have separate names among the Arabs. Around them were\r\ngenerally deep and rugged gorges and ravines, or water-courses, whose\r\nsides were formed of ledges of granite nearly perpendicular, of a pink\r\ncolor, and fine texture. There are no _gravel_ hills, as mentioned by\r\nDr. Robinson, but a series of low granite hills, much broken up, and of\r\ndifferent colors, principally of a greenish-gray and brown. The plain is\r\ncovered with a fine _debris_ of granite. Whilst crossing over these low\r\nhills, my friend pointed out the path between them and Sinai, in the\r\nravine, through which he had passed yesterday on his return from St.\r\nCatharine; and it was seen that no plain would be visible from any part\r\nof it, owing to the height of the spurs which separated the ravine from\r\nSebaiyeh, and we concluded that most travellers had been led into false\r\nviews concerning this part of the mountain from having taken the same\r\npath, and hence it was that no account has been given respecting the\r\nplain of Sebaiyeh. This ravine around Sinai becomes a deep impassable\r\ngorge, with perpendicular walls, as it enters Wady Lejah, passing\r\nthrough the high neck connecting with the mountain on the south.\r\n\r\n\"'Descending into Lejah, under the rocky precipice of Sinai, we found\r\nthe wady narrow and choked up with huge blocks of granite which had\r\ntumbled from the sides of the adjacent mountains. We could now see the\r\nolive-ground of the deserted convent of _el-Arbain_, situated in the\r\nbottom of the narrow valley. Passing through this garden, we found a\r\nfine running stream of crystal water, of which we partook freely, for\r\nour thirst was great. The garden was walled, and well irrigated by many\r\nsmall canals, but nothing seemed to flourish but the olive.\r\n\r\n\"'Continuing down the valley, amidst loose rocks of granite, upon some\r\nof which were inscriptions in the Sinaite, Greek, and Arabic characters,\r\nand enjoying the wildness of the scene, and the gloomy grandeur of the\r\nlofty mountains of naked rocks which almost overhung our path, we saw\r\nHoreb on our right, and soon entered upon the plain before it called\r\n_Wady Rahah_. After taking a view of Horeb as the sun was setting, we\r\nmade our way to the convent, to pass the night within its hospitable\r\nwalls. Thus was completed a walk around the whole mountain of Sinai.\r\n\r\n\"'The results of these investigations, together with the information\r\nafforded by Burckhardt and other travellers, have served to convince my\r\nown mind that this district is every way adapted to the circumstances\r\nattending the encampment of the Israelites during the promulgation of\r\nthe law upon Mount Sinai Though other mountains in this vicinity may\r\nanswer as well as that of Jebel Musa for this great purpose, still I\r\ncannot see any good reason for taking from this mountain that holy\r\ncharacter with which tradition has invested it for the last fifteen\r\ncenturies.'\r\n\r\n\"Thus,\" says Dr. Kitto, \"it seems that the question as to the\r\ncamping-ground of the Israelites, which seemed to have been settled by\r\nthe researches of Dr. Robinson and others, must now be regarded as\r\nre-opened for further investigations. The fact is, that a complete and\r\ncareful survey of the whole of this central mountain region yet remains\r\nto be taken.\"\r\n\r\nThe friend of Mr. Kellogg alluded to in the preceding pages was an\r\nEnglish gentleman, Mr. Ackanth, (of the East India Service,) whose notes\r\nwill amply vindicate Mr. Kellogg's conclusions.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[F] The _Literary World_ at that period was edited by the able, candid,\r\nand universally beloved C.F. Hoffman.--(Ed. Int.)\r\n\r\n[G] \"The writer seems not to have been aware that this still leaves the\r\npriority to Laborde--whose journey was undertaken even earlier than that\r\nof Robinson, and whose really valuable work, _Commentaire Geographique\r\nsur l'Exode et les Nombres_, which now lies before us, was _published_\r\nin the very year of Mr. Kellogg's journey, 1844. This work certainly\r\nforms the best _literary_ result of Laborde's celebrated journey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAFAYETTE, TALLEYRAND, METTERNICH, AND NAPOLEON.\r\n\r\nSketched By Lord Holland.[H]\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Holland, says the _Examiner_, has been induced by \"the recent\r\nevents on the Continent\" to publish what his father had written on\r\nforeign politics. \"If not wholly impartial,\" the present Lord Holland\r\nremarks of his father, \"he is acknowledged by all who knew him to have\r\nbeen as candid as he was benevolent.\" He might have said more than\r\nthis--indeed far more than it might have been quite becoming in a son to\r\nsay. The late Lord Holland was a noble example of the highest and best\r\ntraits of the English character. Throughout his public life he was the\r\nchampion of all just causes; the friend of all who fairly sought\r\nredress; the fearless advocate of liberty, religious and civil, in days\r\ndisastrous to both; a statesman of singular courage and consistency, a\r\nmost accomplished gentleman and scholar. He had learning without\r\npedantry, and wit without ill-nature. His sweetness of temper and\r\nfascinating grace of manner had been commemorated by many distinguished\r\nmen who had felt their winning potency and charm. But above all he had a\r\nstore of observation and anecdote of the richest kind, and a power of\r\napplying it with surprising felicity to whatever subject might be under\r\ndiscussion. This book is a delightful surviving proof of that quality in\r\nhis character. Its anecdotes are told with a charming ease and fulness\r\nof knowledge. No one so quickly as Lord Holland detected the notable\r\npoints, whether of a book or a man, or turned them to such happy\r\naccount. We do not read a page of this volume without feeling that a\r\nsupreme master of that exquisite art is speaking to us. It comprises\r\nrecollections of the scenes and actors in the stirring drama which was\r\nplayed out on the Continent between 1791 and 1815. It opens with the\r\ndeath of Mirabeau and closes with the death of Napoleon. France,\r\nDenmark, Prussia, and Spain are the countries principally treated of.\r\nLord Holland's first visit to France was in 1791, just after the death\r\nof Mirabeau and the disastrous flight to Varennes. LAFAYETTE seems to\r\nhave been more disposed than any other public actor in the revolution to\r\nput faith in the king even after that incident, and his confidence won\r\nover the young English traveller. But the weakness as well as strength\r\nof Lafayette is well hit off.\r\n\r\n\"Lafayette was, however, then as always, a pure disinterested man, full\r\nof private affection and public virtue, and not devoid of such talents\r\nas firmness of purpose, sense of honor, and earnestness of zeal will, on\r\ngreat occasions, supply. He was indeed accessible to flattery, somewhat\r\ntoo credulous, and apt to mistake the forms, or, if I may so phrase it,\r\nthe pedantry of liberty for the substance, as if men could not enjoy any\r\nfreedom without subscribing to certain abstract principles and arbitrary\r\ntests, or as if the profession and subscription, nay, the technical\r\nobservance of such tests and principles, were not, on the other hand,\r\noften compatible with practical oppression and tyranny.\"\r\n\r\nMARIE ANTOINETTE is treated almost as badly as by Mr. Geffeson, who\r\nthought her a devil, far less tenderly than we should have expected. Her\r\n\"amours\" are spoken of, though with the limitation that \"they were not\r\nnumerous, scandalous, or degrading.\" We gather that Talleyrand believed\r\nher to have been guilty in a special instance named, and that Madame\r\nChampan had confessed it to him. At the same time her person is not very\r\nflatteringly described.\r\n\r\n\"As I was not presented at Court, I never saw the Queen but at the\r\nplay-house. She was then in affliction, and her countenance was, no\r\ndoubt, disfigured by long suffering and resentment. I should not,\r\nhowever, suppose that the habitual expression of it, even in happier\r\nseasons, had ever been very agreeable. Her beauty, however extolled,\r\nconsisted, I suspect, exclusively in a fair skin, a straight person, and\r\na stately air, which her admirers termed dignity, and her enemies pride\r\nand disdain. Her total want of judgment and temper no doubt contributed\r\nto the disasters of the Royal Family, but there was no member of it to\r\nwhom the public was uniformly so harsh and unjust, and her trial and\r\ndeath were among the most revolting parts of the whole catastrophe. She\r\nwas indeed insensible when led to the scaffold; but the previous\r\npersecution which she underwent was base, unmanly, cruel, and ungenerous\r\nto the last degree.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a better case is made out for Egalite than any writer\r\nhas yet been bold enough, or informed enough, to attempt. His false\r\nposition with the Court is shown not to have been of his own seeking,\r\nand to have ultimately driven him reluctantly into the ranks of the\r\nextreme party. His courage is vindicated successfully, his sincerity and\r\ntruthfulness less so. Lord Holland retained his regard for the Orleans\r\nfamily to the close of his life. He was one of the warmest defenders of\r\nthe late King of the French. There are some capital notices of\r\nTALLYRAND.\r\n\r\n\"It was in this visit to Paris in 1791, that I first formed acquaintance\r\nwith M. Talleyrand. I have seen him in most of his vicissitudes of\r\nfortune; from his conversation I have derived much of the little\r\nknowledge I possess of the leading characters in France before and\r\nduring the Revolution. He was then still a bishop. He had, I believe,\r\nbeen originally forced into holy orders, in consequence of his lameness,\r\nby his family, who, on that account, treated him with an indifference\r\nand unkindness shameful and shocking. He was for some time _aumonier_ to\r\nhis uncle, the Archbishop of Rheims; and when Mr. Pitt went to that town\r\nto learn French, after the peace of 1782, he lodged him in an apartment\r\nin the abbey of St. Thierry, where he was then residing with his uncle,\r\nand constantly accompanied him for six weeks, a circumstance to which,\r\nas I have heard M. Talleyrand remark with some asperity, Mr. Pitt never\r\nhad the grace to allude either during his embassy, or his emigration, or\r\nin 1794, when he refused to recall the cruel order by which he was sent\r\naway from England under the alien bill. Talleyrand was initiated into\r\npublic affairs under M. de Calonne, and learnt from that lively minister\r\nthe happy facility of transacting business without effort and without\r\nceremony in the corner of a drawing-room, or in the recess of a window.\"\r\n\r\nAgain--of Talleyrand's bon-mots. The bit at Chateaubriand is one of the\r\nhappiest we can remember.\r\n\r\n\"'Il faut avoir aime Mme. de Stael pour connaitre tout le bonheur\r\nd'aimer une bete,' was a saying of his much quoted at Paris at that\r\ntime, in explanation of his passion for Mme. Grand, who certainly did\r\nnot win him or any one else by the fascination of her wit or\r\nconversation. For thirty or forty years, the bon-mots of M. de\r\nTalleyrand were more frequently repeated and more generally admired\r\nthan those of any living man. The reason was obvious. Few men uttered so\r\nmany, and yet fewer any equally good. By a happy combination of neatness\r\nin language and ease and suavity of manner, with archness and sagacity\r\nof thought, his sarcasms assumed a garb at once so courtly and so\r\ncareless, that they often diverted almost as much as they could mortify\r\neven their immediate objects. His humorous reproof to a gentleman\r\nvaunting with self-complacency the extreme beauty of his mother, and\r\napparently implying that it might account for advantages in person in\r\nher descendants, is well known: 'Cetait donc,' said he, 'Monsieur votre\r\npere qui n'etait pas si bien.' The following is more recent, but the\r\nhumor of it hardly less arch or less refined. The celebrity of M. de\r\nChateaubriand, the vainest of mortals, was on the wane. About the same\r\ntime, it happened to be casually mentioned in conversation that\r\nChateaubriand was affected with deafness, and complained bitterly of\r\nthat infirmity. 'Je compends,' said Talleyrand; 'dequis qu'on a cesse de\r\nparler de lui, il se croit sourd.'\"\r\n\r\nWe find a long portrait gallery of ministers, and princes, and\r\nprincesses, one more imbecile, ignorant, and corrupt than another. One\r\nminister did not know the difference between Russia and Prussia; another\r\nalways wrote Asiatic for Henseatic, and thought his correction\r\nnecessary. Much light is thrown on the first quarrel between Ferdinand\r\nand his father; and the narrow escape of the Duke of Infantado is well\r\ntold. Godoy, like all who had the honor of Lord Holland's acquaintance,\r\nwas in some degree a favorite of his, his good qualities being brought\r\nout to neutralize his many bad ones. Jovellanos and Arguelles appear the\r\nonly honest characters in the midst of such a mass of vice, and even\r\nthey were pedantic, impracticable, and prejudiced. No history,\r\nnarrative, or memoir can be so disgusting as those of Spain and its\r\ncourt under the dominion of the House of Bourbon. The imagination of no\r\nnovelist has ever attained that _acme_ of duplicity, cruelty, villany,\r\nand cowardice, which made up the character of Ferdinand. The general\r\nopinion of PRINCE METTERNICH, since he has become familiar to London\r\ncircles, has been rather to diminish former opinion of his superior\r\nwisdom. Lord Holland's early opinion of the prince is thus recorded:\r\n\r\n\"He seems hardly qualified by any superior genius to assume the\r\nascendency in the councils of his own and neighboring nations, which\r\ncommon rumor has for some years attributed to him. He appeared to me, in\r\nthe short intercourse I had with him, little superior to the common run\r\nof continental politicians and courtiers, and clearly inferior to the\r\nEmperor of Russia in those qualities which secure an influence in great\r\naffairs. Some who admit the degrading but too prevalent opinion that a\r\ndisregard to truth is useful and necessary in the government of mankind,\r\nhave on that score maintained the contrary proposition. His manners are\r\nreckoned insinuating. In my slight acquaintance with him in London I was\r\nnot struck with them; they seemed such as might have been expected from\r\na German who had studied French vivacity in the fashionable novels of\r\nthe day. I saw little of a sagacious and observant statesman, or of a\r\ncourtier accustomed to very refined and enlightened society.\"\r\n\r\nBut the statesman who sustained Austria and procured for it the alliance\r\nof France was not Metternich. Napoleon is known to have long wavered as\r\nto whether he would build his European system on a close alliance with\r\nPrussia or with Austria. Bignon we believe it is that gives the reasons\r\nin the imperial mind for and against. Prussia was the preferable ally,\r\nbeing a new country, untrammelled by aristocratic ideas, ambitious,\r\nmilitary, and eager for domination. But Napoleon had humiliated Prussia\r\ntoo deeply to be forgiven. And then Napoleon had in those around him\r\npoliticians who revered Austria for its antiquity and prestige, and who,\r\nlike Lord Aberdeen, made the Caesar of Vienna the pivot on which their\r\nideas of policy turned. Talleyrand was one of them. He worshipped\r\nAustria, opposed all his master's plans for crushing her, and even dared\r\nto thwart those plans by revealing them to Alexander, and prompting him\r\nsecretly to oppose them. Such treachery fully warrants all the suspicion\r\nand harshness with which Napoleon treated Talleyrand. The latter's\r\nconduct is fully revealed in this volume by Lord Holland. In fact, the\r\nway in which Napoleon found his policy most seriously counteracted, and\r\nhis projects foiled, was his weakness in employing the men of the\r\n_ancien regime_, the nobles, whom he preferred for their pleasing and\r\ngood manners, but who invariably betrayed the _parvenu_ master, who\r\nemployed and courted them. By an instance of this grievously misplaced\r\nconfidence Napoleon lost his throne. In the last events and negotiations\r\nof 1814 Napoleon employed Caulaincourt, who, had he had full power,\r\nmight have made an arrangement. Talleyrand and his party at the same\r\ntime employed M. de Vitrolles, and sent him to the Emperor of Austria to\r\nlearn on what terms he would be induced either to support Napoleon or\r\nabandon him. The Emperor of Austria was naturally most unwilling to\r\nproceed to the latter extreme. But M. Vitrolles, a secret agent of the\r\nBourbons, so falsified and misrepresented everything to the Emperor that\r\nthe sacrifice of Napoleon was assented to.\r\n\r\nOur last extract relates some traits of the great NAPOLEON which seem\r\nmore than ordinarily worth his nephew's attention just now. They are\r\ntaken from a somewhat elaborate character of the Emperor which occupies\r\nnearly a third of the volume.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing could exceed the order and regularity with which his household\r\nboth as Consul and Emperor was conducted. The great things he\r\naccomplished, and the savings he made, without even the imputation of\r\navarice or meanness, with the sum comparatively inconsiderable of\r\nfifteen millions of francs a year, are marvellous, and expose his\r\nsuccessors, and indeed all European Princes, to the reproach of\r\nnegligence or incapacity. In this branch of his government he owed much\r\nto Duroc. It is said that they often visited the markets of Paris (les\r\nhalles) dressed in plain clothes and early in the morning. When any\r\ngreat accounts were to be submitted to the Emperor, Duroc would apprize\r\nhim in secret of some of the minutest details. By an adroit allusion to\r\nthem or a careless remark on the points upon which he had received such\r\nrecent and accurate information, Napoleon contrived to impress his\r\naudience with a notion that the master's eye was every where. For\r\ninstance, when the Tuileries were furnished, the upholsterer's charges\r\nthough not very exorbitant, were suspected by the Emperor to be higher\r\nthan the usual profit of that trade would have warranted. He suddenly\r\nasked some minister who was with him how much the egg at the end of the\r\nbell-rope should cost? 'J'ignore,' was the answer.--'Eh bien! nous\r\nverrons,' said he, and then cut off the ivory handle, called for a\r\nvalet, and bidding him dress himself in plain and ordinary clothes, and\r\nneither divulge his immediate commission or general employment to any\r\nliving soul, directed him to inquire the price of such articles at\r\nseveral shops in Paris, and to order a dozen as for himself. They were\r\none-third less dear than those furnished to the palace. The Emperor,\r\ninferring that the same advantage had been taken in the other articles,\r\nstruck a third off the whole charge, and directed the tradesman to be\r\ninformed that it was done at his express command, because on\r\n_inspection_ he had himself discovered the charges to be by one-third\r\ntoo exorbitant. When afterwards in the height of his glory he visited\r\nCaen with the Empress Maria Louisa, and a train of crowned heads and\r\nprinces, his old friend, M. Mechin, the Prefect, aware of his taste for\r\ndetail, waited upon him with five statistical tables of the expenditure,\r\nrevenue, prices, produce, and commerce of the departments. 'C'est bon,'\r\nsaid he, when he received them the evening of his arrival, 'vous et moi\r\nnous ferous bien de l'esprit sur tout cela demain au Conseil.'\r\nAccordingly, he astonished all the leading proprietors of the department\r\nat the meeting next day, by his minute knowledge of the prices of good\r\nand bad cyder, and of the produce and other circumstances of the various\r\ndistricts of the department. Even the Royalist gentry were impressed\r\nwith a respect for his person, which gratitude for the restitution of\r\ntheir lands had failed to inspire, and which, it must be acknowledged,\r\nthe first faint hope of vengeance against their enemies entirely\r\nobliterated in almost every member of that intolerant faction. Other\r\nprinces have shown an equal fondness for minute details with Napoleon,\r\nbut here is the difference. The use they made of their knowledge was to\r\ntorment their inferiors and weary their company: the purpose to which\r\nNapoleon applied it was to confine the expanses of the State to the\r\nobjects and interests of the community.\"\r\n\r\nLord Holland dwells at some length on the treatment to which Napoleon\r\nwas subjected by the English Government, and on the generous attempts of\r\nLady Holland to alleviate his captivity. This part of the volume has\r\nmuch present interest, and will be read with great eagerness by all. Of\r\nthe Emperor's temper, he says:\r\n\r\n\"Napoleon, even in the plenitude of his power, seldom gratified his\r\nrevenge by resorting to any act either illegal or unjust, though he\r\nfrequently indulged his ill-humor by speaking both of and to those who\r\nhad displeased him in a manner mortifying to their feelings and their\r\npride. The instances of his love of vengeance are very few: they are\r\ngenerally of an insolent rather than a sanguinary character, more\r\ndiscreditable to his head than his heart, and a proof of his want of\r\nmanners, taste, and possibly feeling, but not of a dye to affect his\r\nhumanity. Of what man, possessed of such extended yet such disputed\r\nauthority, can so much be said? Of Washington? Of Cromwell? But\r\nWashington, if he had ever equal provocation and motives for revenge,\r\ncertainly never possessed such power to gratify it. His glory, greater\r\nin truth than that of Caesar, Cromwell, and Bonaparte, was that he never\r\naspired: but he disdained such power; he never had it, and cannot\r\ntherefore deserve immoderate praise for not exerting what he did not\r\npossess. In the affair of General Lee, he did not, if I recollect, show\r\nmuch inclination to forgive. Even Cromwell did not possess the power of\r\nrevenge to the same extent as Napoleon. There is reason, however, to\r\ninfer from his moderation and forbearance that he would have used it as\r\nsparingly. But Cromwell is less irreproachable, on the score of another\r\nvice, viz., ingratitude. Napoleon not only never forgot a favor, but,\r\nunlike most ambitious characters, never allowed subsequent injuries to\r\ncancel his recollection of services. He was uniformly indulgent to the\r\nfaults of those whom he had once distinguished. He saw them, he\r\nsometimes exposed and rectified, but he never punished or revenged them.\r\nMany have blamed him for this on the score of policy; but if it was not\r\nsense and calculation, it should be ascribed to good-nature. None, I\r\npresume, will impute it to weakness or want of discernment.\"\r\n\r\nThis account of Napoleon's ideas on religion is curious, and we think\r\nnew.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever were the religious sentiments of this extraordinary man, such\r\ncompanions were likely neither to fix nor to shake, to sway nor to alter\r\nthem. I have been at some pains to ascertain the little that can be\r\nknown of his thoughts on such subjects, and, though it is not very\r\nsatisfactory, it appears to me worth recording.\r\n\r\n\"In the early periods of the Revolution, he, in common with many of his\r\ncountrymen, conformed to the fashion of treating all such matters, both\r\nin conversation and action, with levity and even derision. In his\r\nsubsequent career, like most men exposed to wonderful vicissitudes, he\r\nprofessed, half in jest and half in earnest, a sort of confidence in\r\nfatalism and predestination. But on some solemn public occasions, and\r\nyet more in private and sober discussion, he not only gravely disclaimed\r\nand reproved infidelity, but both by actions and words implied his\r\nconviction that a conversion to religious enthusiasm might befal\r\nhimself, or any other man. He had more than tolerance--he had indulgence\r\nand respect for extravagant and ascetic notions of religious duty. He\r\ngrounded that feeling not on their soundness or their truth, but on the\r\nuncertainty of what our minds may be reserved for, on the possibility of\r\nour being prevailed upon to admit and even to devote ourselves to tenets\r\nwhich at first excite our derision. It has been observed that there was\r\na tincture of Italian superstition in his character; a sort of\r\nconviction from reason that the doctrines of revelation were not true,\r\nand yet a persuasion, or at least an apprehension, that he might live to\r\nthink them so. He was satisfied that the seeds of belief were deeply\r\nsown in the human heart. It was on that principle that he permitted and\r\njustified, though he did not dare to authorize, the revival of La Trappe\r\nand other austere orders. He contended that they might operate as a\r\nsafety-valve for the fanatical and visionary ferment which would\r\notherwise burst forth and disturb society. In his remarks on the death\r\nof Duroc, and in the reasons he alleged against suicide, both in calm\r\nand speculative discussion and in moments of strong emotion, (such as\r\noccurred at Fontainbleau in 1814,) he implied a belief both in fatality\r\nand Providence.\r\n\r\n\"In the programme of his coronation, a part of the ceremony was to\r\nconsist in his taking the communion. But when the plan was submitted to\r\nhim, he, to the surprise of those who had drawn it, was absolutely\r\nindignant at the suggestion. 'No man,' he said, 'had the means of\r\nknowing, or had the right to say, when or where he would take the\r\nsacrament, or whether he would or not.' On this occasion, he added, that\r\nhe would not; nor did he.\r\n\r\n\"There is some mystery about his conduct in similar respects at St.\r\nHelena, and during the last days of his life. He certainly had mass\r\ncelebrated in his chapel while he was well, and in his bedroom when ill.\r\nBut though I have reason to believe that the last sacraments were\r\nactually administered to him privately a few days before his death, and\r\nprobably after confession, yet Count Montholon, from whom I derive\r\nindirectly my information, also stated that he received Napoleon's\r\nearnest and distinct directions to conceal all the preliminary\r\npreparations for that melancholy ceremony from all his other companions,\r\nand even to enjoin the priest, if questioned, to say he acted by Count\r\nMontholon's orders, but had no knowledge of the Emperor's wishes.\r\n\r\n\"It seems as if he had some desire for such assurance as the Church\r\ncould give, but yet was ashamed to own it. He knew that some at St.\r\nHelena, and more in France, would deem his recourse to such consolation\r\ninfirmity; perhaps he deemed it so himself. Religion may sing her\r\ntriumph, philosophy exclaim 'pauvre humanite,' more impartial scepticism\r\ndespair of discovering the motive, but truth and history must, I\r\nbelieve, acknowledge the fact.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[H] _Foreign Reminiscences._ By Henry Richard Lord Holland.

Griswold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Formerly,\" said Baron Cuvier, in a report to the Royal Academy of\r\nSciences in Paris, \"European naturalists had to make known her own\r\ntreasures to America; but now her Mitchells, Harlans, and Charles\r\nBonapartes, have repaid with interest the debt which she owed to Europe.\r\nThe history of the American birds by Wilson, already equals in elegance\r\nour most beautiful works in ornithology, and if ever that of Audubon be\r\ncompleted, it will have to be confessed that in magnificence of\r\nexecution the Old World is surpassed by the New.\" The work of the\r\n\"American backwoodsman\" thus alluded to, has long been completed; the\r\ngreat Cuvier subsequently acknowledged it to be \"the most splendid\r\nmonument which art has erected in honor of ornithology;\" and the\r\njudgment of mankind has placed the name of our countryman first in the\r\nlist of authors and artists who have illustrated the beautiful branch of\r\nnatural history to which he has devoted so large a portion of his long\r\nand heroic life.\r\n\r\nJOHN JAMES AUDUBON was born in Louisiana about the year 1782. He was of\r\nFrench descent, and his parents perceiving early the bent of his genius\r\nsent him to Paris to pursue his education. While there he attended\r\nschools of natural history and the arts, and in drawing took lessons\r\nfrom the celebrated David. He returned in his eighteenth year, and his\r\nfather soon after gave him a farm near Philadelphia, where the\r\nPerkioming creek falls into the Schuylkill. Its fine woods offered him\r\nnumerous subjects for his pencil, and he here commenced that series of\r\ndrawings which ultimately swelled into the magnificent collection of The\r\nBirds of America. Here too he was married, and here was born his eldest\r\nson. He engaged in commercial speculations, but was not successful. His\r\nlove for the fields and flowers, the forests and their winged\r\ninhabitants, we readily suppose unfitted him for trade. At the end of\r\nten years he removed to the west. There were then no steamboats on the\r\nOhio, and few villages and no cities on its shores. Reaching that noble\r\nriver in the warm days of autumn, he purchased a small boat in which,\r\nwith his wife and child and two rowers, he leisurely pursued his way\r\ndown to Henderson, in Kentucky, where his family resided several years.\r\nHe appears at first to have engaged in commerce, for he mentions his\r\nmeeting with Wilson, of whom till then he had never heard, as having\r\noccurred in his counting-room in Louisville in the spring of 1810. His\r\ngreat predecessor was procuring subscriptions for his work. He called on\r\nAudubon, explained the nature of his occupations, and requested his\r\npatronage. The merchant was surprised and gratified at the sight of his\r\nvolumes, and had taken a pen to add his name to the list of subscribers,\r\nwhen his partner abruptly said to him in French, \"My dear Audubon, what\r\ninduces you to do so? your own drawings are certainly far better, and\r\nyou must know as much of the habits of American birds as this gentleman.\r\n\"Wilson probably understood the remark, for he appeared not to be\r\npleased, and inquired whether Audubon had any drawings of birds. A large\r\nportfolio was placed upon the table, and all its contents exhibited by\r\nthe amateur ornithologist. Wilson was surprised; he had supposed he was\r\nhimself the only person engaged in forming such a collection; and asked\r\nif it was intended to publish them. Audubon replied in the negative: he\r\nhad never thought of presenting the fruits of his labors to the world.\r\nWilson was still more surprised; he lost his cheerfulness; and though\r\nbefore he left Louisville Audubon explored with him the neighboring\r\nwoods, loaned him his drawings, and in other ways essayed to promote his\r\ninterests and happiness, he shook the dust from his feet when he\r\ndeparted, and wrote in his diary that \"literature or art had not a\r\nfriend in the place.\" Far be it from me to write a word in dispraise of\r\nAlexander Wilson. He was a man of genius, enthusiasm, and patient\r\nendurance; an honor to the country of his birth, and a glory to that of\r\nhis adoption; but he evidently could not bear the thought of being\r\nexcelled. With all his merits he was even then greatly inferior to\r\nAudubon, and his heart failed him when he contrasted the performances\r\nwhich had won fame for him with those of the unknown lover of the same\r\nmistress, Nature, whom he thus encountered.\r\n\r\nAudubon must soon have abandoned or neglected his day-books and ledgers,\r\nfor in 1811 we find him with his rifle and drawing paper among the\r\nbayous of Florida, and in the following years making long and tedious\r\njourneys, searching the forests and prairies, the shores of rivers,\r\nlakes, gulfs, and seas, for the subjects of his immortal work, of the\r\npublication of which, however, he had never yet had a thought.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth of April, 1824, he visited Philadelphia, where the late Dr.\r\nMease, whom he had known on his first arrival in Pennsylvania, presented\r\nhim to Charles Lucien Bonaparte, who in his turn introduced him to the\r\nLyceum of Natural History. He perceived that he could look for no\r\npatronage in this city, and so proceeded to New-York, where he was\r\nreceived with a kindness well suited to elevate his depressed spirits,\r\nand afterwards ascending the Hudson, went westward to the great lakes,\r\nand in the wildest solitudes of the pathless forests renewed his labors.\r\nHe now began to think of visiting Europe; the number of his drawings had\r\ngreatly increased notwithstanding a misfortune by which two hundred of\r\nthem, representing nearly a thousand birds, had been destroyed; and he\r\nfancied his work under the hands of the engraver. \"Happy days and nights\r\nof pleasing dreams\" followed, as he retired farther from the haunts of\r\nmen, determined to leave nothing undone which could be accomplished by\r\ntime or toil. Another year and a half passed by; he returned to his\r\nfamily, then in Louisiana; and having explored the woods of that state,\r\nat last sailed for England, where he arrived in 1826. In Liverpool and\r\nManchester his works procured him a generous reception from the most\r\ndistinguished men of science and letters; and when he proceeded to\r\nEdinburgh and exhibited there his four hundred paintings, \"the hearts of\r\nall warmed toward Audubon,\" says Professor Wilson, \"who were capable of\r\nconceiving the difficulties, dangers, and sacrifices that must have been\r\nencountered, endured, and overcome before genius could have embodied\r\nthese, the glory of its innumerable triumphs.\"[I] \"The man himself,\" at\r\nthis period writes the same eloquent author in another work, \"is just\r\nwhat you would expect from his productions; full of fine enthusiasm and\r\nintelligence, most interesting in his looks and manners, a perfect\r\ngentleman, and esteemed by all who know him for the simplicity and\r\nfrankness of his nature.\"[J]\r\n\r\nHis reception encouraged him to proceed immediately with his plans of\r\npublication. It was a vast undertaking which it would take probably\r\nsixteen years to accomplish, and when his first drawings were delivered\r\nto the engraver he had not a single subscriber. His friends pointed out\r\nthe rashness of the project and urged him to abandon it. \"But my heart\r\nwas nerved,\" he exclaims, \"and my reliance on that Power on whom all\r\nmust depend brought bright anticipations of success.\" Leaving his work\r\nin the care of his engravers and agents, in the summer of 1828 he\r\nvisited Paris, and received the homage of the most distinguished men of\r\nscience in that capital. Humboldt too, whose gigantic intelligence arose\r\nabove all others in central Europe, became his warm friend, and remained\r\nuntil his death a sympathizing correspondent.\r\n\r\nThe ensuing winter was passed in London, and in April, 1829, he returned\r\nto America to explore anew the woods of the middle and southern states.\r\nAccompanied by his wife he left New Orleans on the eighth of January,\r\n1830, for New-York, and on the twenty-fifth of April, just a year from\r\nthe time of his departure, he was again in the Great Metropolis. Before\r\nthe close of 1830, he had issued his first volume, containing one\r\nhundred plates, representing ninety-nine species of birds, every figure\r\nof the size and colors of life. The applause with which it was received\r\nwas enthusiastic and universal. The kings of England and France had\r\nplaced their names at the head of his subscription list; he was made a\r\nfellow of the Royal Societies of London and Edinburgh; a member of the\r\nNatural History Society of Paris, and other celebrated institutions; and\r\nCuvier, Swainson, and indeed the great ornithologists of every country,\r\nexhausted the words of panegyric in his praise.\r\n\r\nOn the first of August, 1831, Audubon arrived once more in New-York, and\r\nhaving passed a few days with his friends there and in Philadelphia,\r\nproceeded to Washington, where the President and other principal\r\nofficers of the government gave him letters of assistance and protection\r\nto be used all along the coasts and inland frontiers where there were\r\ncollectors of revenue or military or naval forces. He had previously\r\nreceived similar letters from the king's ministers to the authorities of\r\nthe British colonies.\r\n\r\nThe next winter and spring were passed in the Floridas and in\r\nCharleston; and early in the summer, bending his course northward to\r\nkeep pace with the birds in their migrations, he arrived in\r\nPhiladelphia, where he was joined by his family. The cholera was then\r\nspreading death and terror through the country, and on reaching Boston\r\nhe was himself arrested by sickness and detained until the middle of\r\nAugust. \"Although I have been happy in forming many valuable friendships\r\nin various parts of the world, all dearly cherished by me,\" he says,\r\n\"the outpouring of kindness which I experienced in Boston far exceeded\r\nall that I have ever met with;\"[K] and he tells us, with characteristic\r\nenthusiasm, of his gratitude to the Appletons, Everetts, Quincys,\r\nPickerings, Parkmans, and other eminent gentlemen and scholars of that\r\nbeautiful and hospitable city.\r\n\r\nProceeding at length upon his mission, he explored the forests of Maine\r\nand New Brunswick, and the shores of the Bay of Fundy, and chartering a\r\nvessel at Eastport, sailed for the gulf of St. Lawrence, the Magdalen\r\nIslands, and the coast of Labrador. Returning as the cold season\r\napproached, he visited Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, and rejoining his\r\nfamily proceeded to Charleston, where he spent the winter, and in the\r\nspring, after nearly three years' travel and research, sailed a third\r\ntime for England.\r\n\r\nAmong the warmest of his British friends, was always the congenial\r\nWilson, great as a poet, greater as critic, and greatest of all as the\r\nauthor of the _Noctes Ambrosianae_, which contain more wit and humor,\r\nmore sound theology, philosophy, and politics, and better and more\r\nvarious literature, than any other man now living has furnished in a\r\nsingle work. This almost universal genius, whose relish for the rod and\r\ngun and wild wood was scarcely less than that he felt for the best\r\nsuppers of Ambrose, or the sharpest onslaught on the Whigs in\r\nParliament, thoroughly appreciated and heartily loved our illustrious\r\ncountryman, and in Blackwood's Magazine for January, 1835, he gives us\r\nthe following admirable sketch of the visit he now made to Edinburgh:\r\n\r\n     \"We were sitting one night, lately, all alone by ourselves,\r\n     almost unconsciously eyeing the members, fire without flame, in\r\n     the many-visioned grate, but at times aware of the symbols and\r\n     emblems there beautifully built up, of the ongoings of human\r\n     life, when a knocking, not loud but resolute, came to the front\r\n     door, followed by the rustling thrill of the bell-wire, and\r\n     then by a tinkling far below, too gentle to waken the house\r\n     that continued to enjoy the undisturbed dream of its repose. At\r\n     first we supposed it might be but some late-home-going\r\n     knight-errant from a feast of shells, in a mood, 'between\r\n     malice and true-love,' seeking to disquiet the slumbers of Old\r\n     Christopher, in expectation of seeing his night-cap (which he\r\n     never wears) popped out of the window, and of hearing his voice\r\n     (of which he is charry in the open air) simulating a scold upon\r\n     the audacious sleep-breaker. So we benevolently laid back our\r\n     head on our easy-chair, and pursued our speculations on the\r\n     state of affairs in general--and more particularly on the\r\n     floundering fall of that inexplicable people--the Whigs. We had\r\n     been wondering, and of our wondering found no end, what could\r\n     have been their chief reasons for committing suicide. It\r\n     appeared a case of very singular _felo-de-se_--for they had so\r\n     timed the 'rash act,' as to excite strong suspicions in the\r\n     public mind that his Majesty had committed murder.\r\n     Circumstances, however, had soon come to light, that proved to\r\n     demonstration, that the wretched Ministry had laid violent\r\n     hands on itself, and effected its purpose by strangulation.\r\n     There--was the fatal black ring visible round the neck--through\r\n     a mere thread; there--were the blood-shot eyes protruding from\r\n     the sockets; there--the lip-biting teeth clenched in the last\r\n     convulsions; and there--sorriest sight of all--was the ghastly\r\n     suicidical smile, last relic of the laughter of despair. But\r\n     the knocking would not leave the door--and listening to its\r\n     character, we were assured that it came from the fist of a\r\n     friend, who saw light through the chinks of the shutter, and\r\n     knew, moreover, that we never put on the shroud of death's\r\n     pleasant brother sleep, till 'ae wee short hour ayont the\r\n     twal,' and often not till earliest cock-crow, which chanticleer\r\n     utters somewhat drowsily, and then replaces his head beneath\r\n     his wing, supported on one side by a partlet, on the other by a\r\n     hen. So we gathered up our slippered feet from the rug, lamp in\r\n     hand stalked along the lobbies, unchained and unlocked the oak\r\n     which our faithful night porter Somnus had sported--and lo! a\r\n     figure muffled up in a cloak, and furred like a Russ, who\r\n     advanced familiarly into the hall, extended both hands and then\r\n     embracing us, bade God bless us, and pronounced, with somewhat\r\n     of a foreign accent, the name in which we and the world\r\n     rejoice--Christopher North!' We were not slow in returning the\r\n     hug fraternal--for who was it but the 'American\r\n     Woodsman?'--even Audubon himself--fresh from the Floridas--and\r\n     breathing of the pure air of far-off Labrador!\r\n\r\n     \"Three years and upwards had fled since we had taken farewell\r\n     of the illustrious Ornithologist--on the same spot--at the same\r\n     hour; and there was something ghostlike in such return of a\r\n     dear friend from a distant region--almost as if from the land\r\n     of spirits. It seemed as if the same moon again looked at\r\n     us--but then she was wan and somewhat sad--now clear as a\r\n     diamond, and all the starry heavens wore a smile. \"Our words\r\n     they were na mony feck'--but in less time than we have taken to\r\n     write it--we two were sitting cheek by jowl, and hand in hand,\r\n     by that essential fire--while we showed by our looks that we\r\n     both felt, now they were over, that three years were but as one\r\n     day! The cane coal-scuttle, instinct with spirit, beeted the\r\n     fire of its own accord, without word or beck of ours, as if\r\n     placed there by the hands of one of our wakeful Lares; in globe\r\n     of purest crystal the Glenlivet shone; unasked the bright brass\r\n     kettle began to whisper its sweet 'under song;' and a centenary\r\n     of the fairest oysters native to our isle turned towards us\r\n     their languishing eyes, unseen the Nereid that had on the\r\n     instant wafted them from the procreant cradle beds of\r\n     Prestonpans. Grace said, we drew in to supper, and hobnobbing,\r\n     from elegant long-shank, down each naturalist's gullet\r\n     graciously descended, with a gurgle, the mildest, the meekest,\r\n     the very Moses of Ales.\r\n\r\n     \"Audubon, ere half an hour had elapsed, found an opportunity of\r\n     telling us that he had never seen us in a higher state of\r\n     preservation--and in a low voice whispered something about the\r\n     eagle renewing his youth. We acknowledged the kindness by a\r\n     remark on bold bright birds of passage that find the seasons\r\n     obedient to their will, and wing their way through worlds still\r\n     rejoicing in the perfect year. But too true friends were we not\r\n     to be sincere in all we seriously said; and while Audubon\r\n     confessed that he saw rather more plainly than when we parted\r\n     the crowfeet in the corners of our eyes, we did not deny that\r\n     we saw in him an image of the Falco Lencocephalus, for that,\r\n     looking on his 'carum caput,' it answered his own description\r\n     of that handsome and powerful bird, viz. 'the general color of\r\n     the plumage above is dull hair-brown, the lower parts being\r\n     deeply brown, broadly margined with greyish white.' But here he\r\n     corrected us: for 'surely, my dear friend,' quoth he, 'you must\r\n     admit I am a living specimen of the Adult Bird, and you\r\n     remember my description of him in my First Volume.' And thus\r\n     blending our gravities and our gayeties, we sat facing one\r\n     another, each with his last oyster on the prong of his trident,\r\n     which disappeared, like all mortal joys, between a smile and a\r\n     sigh.\r\n\r\n     \"How similar--in much--our dispositions--yet in almost all how\r\n     dissimilar our lives! Since last we parted, 'we scarcely heard\r\n     of half a mile from home'--he tanned by the suns and beaten by\r\n     the storms of many latitudes--we like a ship laid up in\r\n     ordinary, or anchored close in shore within the same sheltering\r\n     bay--with sails unfurled and flags flying but for sake of show\r\n     on some holyday--he like a ship that every morning had been\r\n     dashing through a new world of waves--often close-reefed or\r\n     under bare poles--but oftener affronting the heavens with a\r\n     whiter and swifter cloud than any hoisted by the combined\r\n     fleets in the sky. And now, with canvas unrent, and masts\r\n     unsprung, returned to the very buoy she left. Somewhat faded,\r\n     indeed, in her apparelling--but her hull sound as ever--not a\r\n     speck of dry rot in her timbers--her keel unscathed by\r\n     rock--her cut-water yet sharp as new-whetted scythe ere the\r\n     mower renews his toil--her figure-head, that had so often\r\n     looked out for squalls, now 'patient as the brooding dove'--and\r\n     her bowsprit--but let us man the main-brace; nor is there purer\r\n     spirit--my trusty frere--in the Old World or the New.\r\n\r\n     \"It was quite a Noctes. Audubon told us--by snatches--all his\r\n     travels, history, with many an anecdote interspersed of the\r\n     dwellers among the woods--bird, beast, and man.\r\n\r\n     \"All this and more he told us, with a cheerful voice and\r\n     animated eyes, while the dusky hours were noiselessly wheeling\r\n     the chariot of Night along the star-losing sky; and we too had\r\n     something to tell him of our own home-loving obscurity, not\r\n     ungladdened by studies sweet in the Forest--till Dawn yoked her\r\n     dappled coursers for one single slow stage--and then jocund\r\n     Morn leaping up on the box, took the ribbons in her rosy\r\n     fingers, and, after a dram of dew, blew her bugle, and drove\r\n     like blazes right on towards the gates of Day.\"\r\n\r\n     \"His great work,\" says Wilson, elsewhere, \"was indeed a\r\n     perilous undertaking for a stranger in Britain, without the\r\n     patronage of powerful friends, and with no very great means of\r\n     his own--all of which he embarked in the enterprise dearest to\r\n     is heart. Had it failed, Audubon would have been a ruined\r\n     man--and that fear must have sometimes dismally disturbed him,\r\n     for he is not alone in life, and is a man of strong family\r\n     affections. But happily those nearest his breast are as\r\n     enthusiastic in the love of natural science as himself--and\r\n     were all willing to sink or swim with the beloved husband and\r\n     venerated father. America may well be proud of him--and he\r\n     gratefully records the kindness he has experienced from so many\r\n     of her most distinguished sons. In his own fame he is just and\r\n     generous to all who excel in the same studies; not a particle\r\n     of jealousy is in his composition; a sin, that, alas! seems too\r\n     easily to beset too many of the most gifted spirits in\r\n     literature and in science; nor is the happiest\r\n     genius--imaginative or intellectual--such is the frailty of\r\n     poor human nature at the best--safe from the access of that\r\n     dishonouring passion.\"\r\n\r\nThe second volume of The Birds of America was finished in 1834, and in\r\nDecember of that year he published in Edinburgh the second volume of the\r\nOrnithological Biography. Soon after, while he was in London, a nobleman\r\ncalled upon him, with his family, and on examining some of his original\r\ndrawings, and being told that it would still require eight years to\r\ncomplete the work, subscribed for it, saying, \"I may not see it\r\nfinished, but my children will.\" The words made a deep impression on\r\nAudubon. \"The solemnity of his manner I could not forget for several\r\ndays,\" he writes in the introduction to his third volume; \"I often\r\nthought that neither might I see the work completed, but at length\r\nexclaimed, 'My sons may;' and now that another volume, both of my\r\nillustrations and of my biographies, is finished, my trust in Providence\r\nis augmented, and I cannot but hope that myself and my family together\r\nmay be permitted to see the completion of my labors.\" When this was\r\nwritten, ten years had elapsed since the publication of his first plate.\r\nIn the next three years, among other excursions he made one to the\r\nwestern coast of the Floridas and to Texas, in a vessel placed at his\r\ndisposal by our government; and at the end of this time appeared the\r\nfourth and concluding volume of his engravings, and the fifth of his\r\ndescriptions. The whole comprised four hundred and thirty-five plates,\r\ncontaining one thousand and sixty-five figures, from the Bird of\r\nWashington to the Humming Bird, of the size of life, and a great variety\r\nof land and marine views, and coral and other productions, of different\r\nclimates and seasons, all carefully drawn and colored after nature. Well\r\nmight the great naturalist felicitate himself upon the completion of his\r\ngigantic task. He had spent nearly half a century \"amid the tall grass\r\nof the far-extended prairies of the west, in the solemn forests of the\r\nnorth, on the heights of the midland mountains, by the shores of the\r\nboundless ocean, and on the bosoms of our vast bays, lakes and rivers,\r\nsearching for things hidden since the creation of this wondrous world\r\nfrom all but the Indian who has roamed in the gorgeous but melancholy\r\nwilderness.\" And speaking from the depth of his heart he says, \"Once\r\nmore surrounded by all the members of my dear family, enjoying the\r\ncountenance of numerous friends who have never deserted me, and\r\npossessing a competent share of all that can render life agreeable, I\r\nlook up with gratitude to the Supreme Being, and feel that I am happy.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1839, having returned for the last time to his native country and\r\nestablished himself with his family near the city of New-York, Audubon\r\ncommenced the publication of The Birds of America in imperial octavo\r\nvolumes, of which the seventh and last was issued in the summer of 1844.\r\nThe plates in this edition, reduced from his larger illustrations, were\r\nengraved and colored in the most admirable manner by Mr. Bowen of\r\nPhiladelphia, under the direction of the author, and excepting The Birds\r\nof America in folio, there has never been published so magnificent a\r\nwork on ornithology.\r\n\r\nAudubon was too sincere a worshipper of nature to be content with\r\ninglorious repose, even after having accomplished in action more than\r\nwas ever dreamed of by any other naturalist; and while the \"edition for\r\nthe people\" of his Birds of America was in course of publication, he was\r\nbusy amid the forests and prairies, the reedy swamps of our southern\r\nshores, the cliffs that protect our eastern coasts, by the currents of\r\nthe Mexican gulf and the tide streams of the Bay of Fundy, with his\r\nsons, Victor Gifford and John Woodhouse, making the drawings and writing\r\nthe biographies of the _Quadrupeds of America_, a work in no respect\r\ninferior to that on our birds, which he began to publish about five\r\nyears ago. The plates, on double imperial folio paper, engraved and\r\ncolored by Mr. Bowen after the original drawings made from nature by\r\nAudubon and his sons, are even more magnificent than those of the Birds\r\nof America, which twenty years ago delighted and astonished the\r\nnaturalists of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Biography of American Quadrupeds, accompanying these plates, and of\r\nwhich the first volume appeared in New-York in 1846, was written\r\nprincipally by the Rev. John Bachman, D.D., of Charleston, a long-tried\r\nand enthusiastic friend, of whose introduction to him Audubon thus\r\nspeaks in the preface of the second volume of his Ornithological\r\nBiography:\r\n\r\n     \"It was late in the afternoon when we took our lodgings in\r\n     Charleston. Being fatigued, and having written the substance of\r\n     my journey to my family, and delivered a letter to the Rev. Mr.\r\n     Gilman, I retired to rest. At the first glimpse of day the\r\n     following morning, my assistants and myself were already\r\n     several miles from the city, commencing our search in the\r\n     fields and woods, and having procured abundance of subjects\r\n     both for the pencil and the scalpel, we returned home, covered\r\n     with mud, and so accoutred as to draw towards us the attention\r\n     of every person in the streets. As we approached the\r\n     boarding-house, I observed a gentleman on horseback close to\r\n     our door. He looked at me, came up, inquired if my name was\r\n     Audubon, and on being answered in the affirmative, instantly\r\n     leaped from his saddle, shook me most cordially by the\r\n     hand--there is much to be expressed and understood by a shake\r\n     of the hand--and questioned me in so kind a manner, that I for\r\n     a while felt doubtful how to reply. At his urgent desire, I\r\n     removed to his house, as did my assistants. Suitable apartments\r\n     were assigned to us; and once introduced to the lovely and\r\n     interesting group that composed his family, I seldom passed a\r\n     day without enjoying their society. Servants, carriages,\r\n     horses, and dogs were all at our command, and friends\r\n     accompanied us to the woods and plantations, and formed parties\r\n     for water excursions. Before I left Charleston, I was truly\r\n     sensible of the noble and generous spirit of the hospitable\r\n     Carolinians.\"\r\n\r\nAudubon and Bachman (the same Bachman who recently refuted the heresies\r\nof Agassiz respecting the unity of the human race) were from this time\r\ndevoted friends and co-workers. For several years the health of the hero\r\nnaturalist had declined, and he was rarely if ever seen beyond the\r\nlimits of his beautiful estate on the banks of the Hudson, near this\r\ncity, where, on the twenty-seventh of January, 1851, he died, full of\r\nyears, and illustrious with the most desirable glory.\r\n\r\nAudubon's highest claim to admiration is founded upon his drawings in\r\nnatural history, in which he has exhibited a perfection never before\r\nattempted. In all our climates--in the clear atmosphere, by the dashing\r\nwaters, amid the grand old forests with their peculiar and many-tinted\r\nfoliage, by him first made known to art--he has represented our\r\nfeathered tribes, building their nests and fostering their young, poised\r\non the tip of the spray and hovering over the sedgy margin of the lake,\r\nflying in the clouds in quest of prey or from pursuit, in love, enraged,\r\nindeed in all the varieties of their motion and repose and modes of\r\nlife, so perfectly that all other works of the kind are to his as\r\nstuffed skins to the living birds.\r\n\r\nBut he has also indisputable claims to a high rank as a man of letters.\r\nSome of his written pictures of birds, so graceful, clearly defined,\r\nand brilliantly colored, are scarcely inferior to the productions of his\r\npencil. His powers of general description are not less remarkable. The\r\nwaters seem to dance to his words as to music, and the lights and shades\r\nof his landscapes show the practised hand of a master. The evanescent\r\nshades of manners, also, upon the extreme frontiers, where the\r\nfootprints of civilization have hardly crushed the green leaves, have\r\nbeen sketched with graphic fidelity in his journals.\r\n\r\nNo author has more individuality. The enthusiastic, trustful and loving\r\nspirit which breathes through his works distinguished the man. From the\r\nbeginning he surrendered himself entirely to his favorite pursuit, and\r\nwas intent to learn every thing from the prime teacher, Nature. His\r\nstyle as well as his knowledge was a fruit of his experiences. He had\r\nnever written for the press until after the age at which most authors\r\nhave established their reputation; and when he did write, his page\r\nglowed like the rich wild landscape in the spring, when Nature, then\r\nmost beautiful, \"bathes herself in her own dewy waters.\" We seem to hear\r\nhis expressions of wondering admiration, as unknown mountains, valleys\r\nand lakes burst upon his view, as the deer at his approach leaped from\r\nhis ambush into the deeper solitudes, as the startled bird with rushing\r\nwings darted from his feet into the sky; or his pious thanksgiving, as\r\nat the end of a weary day the song of the sparrow or the robin relieved\r\nhis mind from the heavy melancholy that bore it down.\r\n\r\nWhen the celebrated Buffon had completed the ornithological portion of\r\nhis great work on natural history, he announced with unhesitating\r\nassurance that he had \"finished the history of the birds of the world.\"\r\nTwenty centuries had served for the discovery of only eight hundred\r\nspecies, but this number seemed immense, and the short-sighted\r\nnaturalist declared that the list would admit of \"no material\r\naugmentation\" which embraced hardly a sixteenth of those now known to\r\nexist. To this astonishing advance of the science of ornithology, no one\r\nhas contributed more than Audubon, by his magnificent painting and\r\nfascinating history.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon left unpublished a voluminous autobiography, which we hope\r\nwill be published with as little delay as possible.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[I] Wilson's Miscellanies, vol. ii. p. 118.\r\n\r\n[J] Noctes Ambrosianae, vol. ii. p. 103.\r\n\r\n[K] Introduction to the second volume of Ornithological Biography, p.\r\nxvii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD AGE.\r\n\r\nBy Alfred B.

Then outburst the gleams\r\n      At sunset; nature shone in flashing white,\r\n      And the last rays tinged all with rosy light.\r\n      So Life's bland Autumn o'er, may old age come\r\n    In muffling peace, and death display hope's radiant bloom.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CASTLE IN THE AIR.[L]\r\n\r\nBy R. H. Stoddard.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I.\r\n\r\n          We have two lives about us,\r\n          Within us, and without us;\r\n          Two worlds in which we dwell,\r\n          Alternate Heaven and Hell:\r\n          Without, the sombre Real,\r\n    Within our heart of hearts, the beautiful Ideal!\r\n      I stand between the thresholds of the two,\r\n      Fettered and bound with many a heavy chain;\r\n      I strive to rend their links, but all in vain;\r\n      The False is strong, and holds me from the True.\r\n      Only in dreams my spirit wanders o'er\r\n      The starry portal of the world of bliss,\r\n      And lives the life which Fate denies in this,\r\n    Which may have once been mind, but will be, nevermore.\r\n\r\n    II.\r\n\r\n          My Castle stands alone,\r\n          Away from Earth and Time,\r\n          In some diviner clime,\r\n          In Fancy's tropic zone,\r\n          Beneath its summer skies,\r\n    Where all the live-long year the summer never dies!\r\n      A stately marble pile whose pillars rise,\r\n      From sculptured bases, fluted to the dome,\r\n      With wreathed friezes crowned, all carven nice\r\n      With pendant leaves, like ragged rims of foam;\r\n      A thousand windows front the rising sun,\r\n      Deep-set between the columns, many paned,\r\n      Tri-arched, emblazoned, gorgeously stained,\r\n      Crimson and purple, green and blue, and dun,\r\n      And all their wedded colors fall below,\r\n      Like rainbows shattered on a field of snow;\r\n      A bordering gallery runs along the roof,\r\n      Topt by a cupola, whose glittering spire\r\n      Pierces the brooding clouds, a glowing woof,\r\n    With golden spindles wove in Morning's loom of fire!\r\n\r\n    III.\r\n\r\n          What fine and rare domains\r\n          Untold for leagues around;\r\n          Green parks, and meads, and plains,\r\n          And bosky woods profound,--\r\n    A realm of leafiness, and sweet enchanted ground!\r\n      Before the palace lies a shaven lawn,\r\n      Sloping and shining in the dews of dawn,\r\n      With turfy terraces, and garden bowers,\r\n      Where rows of slender urns are full of flowers;\r\n      Broad oaks o'erarch the winding avenues,\r\n      Edged round with evergreens of fadeless bloom,\r\n      And pour a thousand intermingling hues,\r\n      A many tinted flood of golden gloom;\r\n      Far-seen through twinkling leaves,\r\n      The fountains gush aloft like silver sheaves,\r\n      Drooping with shining ears, and crests of spray,\r\n      And foamy tassels blowing every way,\r\n      Shaking in marble basins white and cold,\r\n      A bright and drainless shower of beaded grain,\r\n      Which winnows off, in sun-illumined rain\r\n      The dusty chaff, a cloud of misty gold;\r\n      Around their volumes, down the plashy tide,\r\n      The swans are sailing mixed in lilies white,\r\n      Like virgin queens in soft disdain and pride,\r\n      Sweeping amid their maids with trains of light;\r\n      A little herd of deer with startled looks,\r\n      In shady parks where all the year they browse,\r\n      Head-down are drinking at the lucid brooks,\r\n      Their antlers mirrored with the tangled boughs;\r\n      My rivers flow beyond, with guardant ranks\r\n      Of silver-liveried poplars, on their banks;\r\n      Barges are fretting at the castle piers,\r\n      Rocking with every ripple in the tide;\r\n      And bridges span the stream with arches wide,\r\n      Their stony 'butments mossed and gray with years;\r\n      An undulating range of vales, and bowers,\r\n      And columned palaces, and distant towers,\r\n      And on the welkin mountains bar the view,\r\n    Shooting their jagged peaks sublimely up the blue!\r\n\r\n    IV.\r\n\r\n          I saunter up the walks;\r\n          My sandals wetted through\r\n          With dripping flowers and stalks,\r\n          That line the avenue;\r\n    My broidered mantle all bedabbled with the dew!\r\n      I climb a flight of steps with regal pride,\r\n      And stroll along an echoing colonnade,\r\n      Sweeping against its pillared balustrade,\r\n      Adown a porch, and through a portal wide,\r\n      And I am in my Castle, Lord of all;\r\n      My faithful groom is standing in the hall\r\n      To doff my shining robe, while servitors,\r\n      And cringing chamberlains beside the doors\r\n      Waving their gilded wands, obsequious wait,\r\n    And bow me on my way in royal pomp and state!\r\n\r\n    V.\r\n\r\n          My chamber lies apart,\r\n          The Castle's very heart,\r\n          And all things rich and rare,\r\n          From land, and sea, and air,\r\n    Are lavished with a wild and waste profusion there!\r\n      The carpeting was woven in Turkish looms,\r\n      From softest wool of fine Circassian sheep;\r\n      Tufted like springy moss in forests deep,\r\n      Illuminate with all its autumn blooms;\r\n      The antique chairs are made of cedar trees,\r\n      Veined with the rings of vanished cennturies\r\n      And touched with winter's frost, and summer's sun;\r\n      Sofas and couches, stuffed with cygnet's fleece,\r\n      Loll round inviting dreaminess and ease;\r\n      The gorgeous window curtains, damask red,\r\n      Suspended, silver-ringed, on bars of gold,\r\n      Droop heavily, in many a fluted fold,\r\n      And, rounding outward, intercept, and shed\r\n      The prisoned daylight o'er the slumbrous room,\r\n      In streams of rosy dimness, purple gloom;\r\n      Hard by are cabinets of curious shells,\r\n      Twisted and jointed, horned, wreathed, and curled,\r\n      And some like moons in rosy mist impearled,\r\n      With coral boughs from ocean's deepest cells;\r\n      Cases of rare medallions, coins antique,\r\n      Found in the dust of cities, Roman, Greek;\r\n      Etruscan urns, transparent, soft, and bright,\r\n      With fawns and dancing shepherds on their sides;\r\n      And costly marble vases dug from night\r\n      In Pompeii, beneath its lava tides:\r\n      Clusters of arms, the spoil of ancient wars;\r\n      Old scimitars of true Damascus brand,\r\n      Short swords with basket hilts to guard the hand,\r\n      And iron casques with rusty visor bars;\r\n      Lances, and spears, and battle axes keen,\r\n      With crescent edges, shields with studded thorns,\r\n      Yew bows, and shafts, and curved bugle horns,\r\n      With tasseled baldricks of the Lincoln green:\r\n      And on the walls with lifted curtains, see!\r\n      The portraits of my noble ancestry;\r\n      Thin featured, stately dames with powdered locks,\r\n      And courtly shepherdesses tending flocks;\r\n      Stiff lords in wigs, and ruffles white as snow,\r\n      Haught peers, and princes centuries ago,\r\n      And dark Sir Hugh, the bravest of the line,\r\n    With all the knightly scars he won in Palestine!\r\n\r\n    VI.\r\n\r\n          My gallery sleeps aloof,\r\n          Soft-lighted through the roof,\r\n          Enshrining pictures old,\r\n          And groups of statues cold,\r\n    The gems of Art, when Art was in her Age of Gold!\r\n      Not picked from any single age or clime,\r\n      Nor one peculiar master, school, or tone;\r\n      Select of all, the best of all alone,\r\n      The spoil and largesse of the Earth and Time;\r\n      Food for all thoughts and fancies, grave or gay;\r\n      Suggestive of old lore, and poets' themes;\r\n      These filled with shapes of waking life, and day,\r\n      And those with spirits and the world of dreams;\r\n      Let me draw back the curtains, one by one,\r\n      And give their muffled brightness to the sun:\r\n\r\n    THE PICTURES.\r\n\r\n      Helen and Paris on their bridal night,\r\n      Under the swinging cressets' starry light,\r\n      With Priam and his fifty sons around,\r\n      Feasting in all their majesty and bloom,\r\n\r\n      Filling their golden cups with eager hands,\r\n      To drink a health, while pale Cassandra stands\r\n      With all her raven tresses unbound,\r\n      Her soul o'ershadowed by the coming doom.\r\n\r\n      Andromache, with all her tearful charms,\r\n      Folded upon the mighty Hector's breast,\r\n      And the babe shrinking in its Nurse's arms,\r\n      Affrightened by the nodding of his crest.\r\n\r\n      The giant Cyclops, sitting in his cave,\r\n      Helped by the diving Ulysses, old and wise,\r\n      Spilling the wine in rivers down his beard,\r\n      Shaggy and grim,--his shoulder overleered\r\n      By swart Silenus, sly and cunning knave,\r\n      Who steals a puffy skin with twinkling eyes.\r\n\r\n      Anacreon, lolling in the myrtle shades,\r\n      Bibbing his Teian draughts with rich delight,\r\n      Pledging the dancing girls and Cyprian maids,\r\n      Pinching their little ears, and shoulders white.\r\n\r\n      A cloudless sunrise on the glittering Nile,\r\n      A bronzed Sphinx, and temple on the shore,\r\n      And robed priests that toss their censers while\r\n      Abased in dust, the populace adore;\r\n\r\n      A beaked galley fretting at its curb,\r\n      With reedy oars, and masts, and silken sails,\r\n      And Cleopatra walks the deck superb,\r\n      Slow-followed by her court in spangled veils.\r\n\r\n      The Virgin Mother, and the Holy Child,\r\n      Holding a globe and sceptre, sweet and mild;\r\n      The Magi bring their gifts with reverent looks,\r\n      And the rapt Shepherds lean upon their crooks.\r\n\r\n      A summer fete, a party on a lawn;\r\n      Bowing gallants, with plumed caps in hand,\r\n      And ladies with guitars, and, far withdrawn,\r\n      The rustic people dancing in a band.\r\n\r\n      A bleak defile, a pass in mountains deep,\r\n      Whose whitened summits wear their morning glow,\r\n      And dark banditti winding down the steep\r\n      Of shelvy rocks, pointing their guns below.\r\n\r\n      A harvest scene, a vineyard on the Rhine;\r\n      Arbors, and wreathed pales, and laughing swains\r\n      Pouring their crowded baskets into wains,\r\n      And vats, and trodden presses gushing wine.\r\n\r\n      A Flemish Tavern: boors and burghers hale\r\n      Drawn round a table, o'er a board of chess,\r\n      Smoking their heavy pipes, and drinking ale,\r\n      Blowing from tankard brims the frothiness.\r\n\r\n      A picture of Cathay, a justice scene;\r\n      Pagodas, statues, and a group around;\r\n      And, in his sedan chair, the Mandarin,\r\n      Reading the scroll of laws to prisoners bound,\r\n      Bambooed with canes, and writhing on the ground;\r\n      And many more whose veils I will undraw\r\n      Some other day, exceeding fresh and fine;\r\n      And statues of the Grecian gods divine,\r\n      In all their various moods of love and awe:\r\n      The Phidean Jove, with calm creative face,\r\n      Like Heaven brooding o'er the deeps of Space;\r\n      Imperial Juno, Mercury, winged-heeled,\r\n      Lit with a message. Mars with helm and shield,\r\n      Apollo with the discus, bent to throw,\r\n      The piping Pan, and Dian with her bow,\r\n      And Cytherca just risen from the swell\r\n      Of crudded foam, half-stooping on her knee,\r\n      Wringing her dripping tresses in the sea\r\n      Whose loving billows climb the curved shell\r\n      Tumultuously, and o'er its edges flow,\r\n    And kiss with pallid lips her nakedness of snow!\r\n\r\n    VII.\r\n\r\n          My boots may lie and mould,\r\n          However rare and old;\r\n          I cannot read to-day,\r\n          Away! with books, away!\r\n          Full-fed with sweets of sense,\r\n    I sink upon my couch in honied indolence!\r\n      Here are rich salvers full of nectarines,\r\n      Dead-ripe pomegranates, sweet Arabian dates,\r\n      Peaches and plums, and clusters fresh from vines,\r\n      And all imaginable sweets, and cakes,\r\n      And here are drinking-cups, and long-necked flasks\r\n      In wicker mail, and bottles broached from casks,\r\n      In cellars delved deep, and winter cold,\r\n      Select, superlative, and centuries old.\r\n      What more can I desire? what book can be\r\n      As rich as Idleness and Luxury?\r\n      What lore can fill my heart with joy divine,\r\n      Like luscious fruitage, and enchanted wine?\r\n      Brimming with Helicon I dash the cup;\r\n      Why should I waste my years in hoarding up\r\n      The thoughts of eld? Let dust to dust return:\r\n      No more for me,--my heart is not an urn!\r\n      I will no longer sip from little flasks,\r\n      Covered with damp and mould, when Nature yields,\r\n      And Earth is full of purple vintage fields;\r\n      Nor peer at Beauty dimmed with mortal masks,\r\n      When I at will may have them all withdrawn,\r\n      And freely gaze in her transfigured face;\r\n      Nor limp in fetters in a weary race,\r\n      When I may fly unbound, like Mercury's fawn;\r\n      No more contented with the sweets of old,\r\n      Albeit embalmed in nectar, since the trees,\r\n      The Eden bowers, the rich Hesperides,\r\n    Droop all around my path, with living fruits of gold!\r\n\r\n    VIII.\r\n\r\n          Oh what a life is mine,\r\n          A life of joy and mirth,\r\n          The sensuous life of Earth,\r\n          Forever fresh and fine.\r\n    A heavenly worldliness, mortality divine!\r\n      When eastern skies, the sea, and misty plain,\r\n      Illumined slowly, doff their nightly shrouds,\r\n      And Heaven's bright archer Morn begins to rain\r\n      His golden arrows through the banded clouds,\r\n      I rise and tramp away the jocund hours,\r\n      Knee-deep in dewy grass, and beds of flowers;\r\n      I race my eager greyhound on the hills,\r\n      And climb with bounding feet the craggy steeps,\r\n      Peak-lifted, gazing down the cloven deeps,\r\n      Where mighty rivers shrink to threaded rills;\r\n      The ramparts of the mountains loom around,\r\n      Like splintery fragments of a ruined world;\r\n      The cliff-bound dashing cataracts, downward hurled\r\n      In thunderous volumes, shake the chasms profound:\r\n      The imperial eagle, with a dauntless eye\r\n      Wheels round the sun, the monarch of the sky;\r\n      I pluck his eyrie in the blasted wood\r\n      Of ragged pines, and when the vulture screams,\r\n      I track his flight along the solitude,\r\n      Like some dark spirit in the world of dreams!\r\n      When Noon in golden armor, travel spent,\r\n      Climbing the azure plains of Heaven, alone,\r\n      Pitches upon its topmost steep his tent,\r\n      And looks o'er Nature from his burning throne,\r\n      I loose my little shallop from its quay,\r\n      And down the winding rivers slowly float,\r\n      And steer in many a shady cove and bay,\r\n      Where birds are warbling with melodious note;\r\n      I listen to the humming of the bees,\r\n      The water's flow, the winds, the wavy trees,\r\n      And take my lute and touch its silver chords,\r\n      And set the Summer's melody to words;\r\n      Sometimes I rove beside the lonely shore,\r\n      Margined and flanked by slanting shelvy ledges,\r\n      And caverns echoing Ocean's sullen roar;\r\n      Threading the bladdery weeds, and paven shells,\r\n      Beyond the line of foam, the jewelled chain,\r\n      The largesse of the ever giving main.\r\n      Tossed at the feet of Earth with surgy swells,\r\n      I plunge into the waves, and strike away,\r\n      Breasting with vigorous strokes the snowy spray;\r\n      Sometimes I lounge in arbors hung with vines,\r\n      The which I sip, and sip, with pleasure mute,\r\n      O'er mouthful bites of golden-rinded fruit;\r\n      When evening comes, I lie in dreamy rest,\r\n      Where lifted casements front the glowing west,\r\n      And watch the clouds, like banners wide unfurled,\r\n      Hung o'er the flaming threshold of the world:\r\n      Its mission done, the holy Day recedes,\r\n      Borne Heavenward in its car, with fiery steeds,\r\n      Leaving behind a lingering flush of light,\r\n      Its mantle fallen at the feet of Night;\r\n      The flocks are penned, the earth is growing dim;\r\n      The moon comes rounding up the welkin's rim,\r\n      Glowing through thinnest mist, an argent shell,\r\n      Washed up the sky from Night's profoundest cell;\r\n      One after one the stars begin to shine\r\n      In drifted beds, like pearls through shallow brine;\r\n      And lo! through clouds that part before the chase\r\n      Of silent winds--a belt of milky white,\r\n      The Galaxy, a crested surge of light,\r\n      A reef of worlds along the sea of Space:\r\n      I hear my sweet musicians far withdrawn,\r\n      Below my wreathed lattice, on the lawn,\r\n      With harp, and lute, and lyre,\r\n      And passionate voices full of tears and fire;\r\n      And envious nightingales with rich disdain\r\n      Filling the pauses of the languid strain;\r\n      My soul is tranced and bound,\r\n      Drifting along the magic sea of sound,\r\n      Driving in a barque of bliss from deep to deep,\r\n    And piloted at last into the ports of Sleep!\r\n\r\n    IX.\r\n\r\n       Nor only this, though this\r\n          Might seal a life of bliss,\r\n          But something more divine,\r\n          For which I once did pine,\r\n          The crown of worlds above,\r\n    The heart of every heart, the Soul of Being--Love!\r\n      I bow obedient to my Lady's sway,\r\n      The sovereignty that won my soul of yore,\r\n      And linger in her presence night and day,\r\n      And feel a heaven around her evermore;\r\n      I sit beside her couch in chambers lone,\r\n      And soft unbraid, and lay her locks apart,\r\n      And take her taper fingers in my own,\r\n      And press them to my lips with leaps of heart;\r\n      Sometimes I kneel to her with cups of wine,\r\n      With pleading eyes, beseeching her to taste,\r\n      With long-delaying lips, the draught divine;\r\n      And when she sips thereof, I clasp her waist,\r\n      And kiss her mouth, and shake her hanging curls,\r\n      And in her coy despite unloose her zone of pearls!\r\n      I live for Love, for Love alone, and who\r\n      Dare chide me for it? who dare call it folly?\r\n      It is a holy thing, if aught is holy,\r\n      And true indeed, if Truth herself is true:\r\n      Earth cleaves to earth, its sensuous life is dear,\r\n      Mortals should love mortality while here,\r\n      And seize the glowing hours before they fly:\r\n      Bright eyes should answer eyes, warm lips should meet,\r\n      And hearts enlocked to kindred hearts should beat,\r\n    And every soul that lives, in love should live and die!\r\n\r\n    X.\r\n\r\n          My dear and gentle wife,\r\n          The Angel of my life,\r\n          Oppressed with sweetest things,\r\n          Has folded up her wings,\r\n          And lies in slumber deep,\r\n    Like some divinest Dream upon the couch of Sleep!\r\n\r\n      Nor sound, nor stir profanes the stilly room,\r\n      Haunted by Sleep and Silence, linked pair;\r\n      The very light itself muffled in gloom,\r\n      Steals in, and melts the enamored air\r\n      Where Love doth brood and dream, while Passion dies,\r\n      Breathing his soul out in a mist of sighs!\r\n      Lo! where she lies behind the curtains white,\r\n      Pillowed on clouds of down,--her golden hair\r\n      Braided around her forehead smooth and fair,\r\n      Like a celestial diadem of light:--\r\n      Her soft voluptuous lips are drawn apart,\r\n      Curving in fine repose, and maiden pride;\r\n      Her creamy breast,--its mantle brushed aside\r\n      Swells with the long pulsation of her heart:\r\n      One languid arm rests on the coverlid,\r\n      And one beneath the crumpled sheet is hid,\r\n      (Ah happy sheets! to hide an arm so sweet!)\r\n      Nor all concealed amid their folds of snow,\r\n      The soft perfection of her shape below,\r\n      Rounded and tapering to her little feet!\r\n      Oh Love! if Beauty ever left her sphere,\r\n      And sovereign sisters, Art and Poesy,\r\n      Moulded in loveliness she slumbers here,\r\n      Slumbers, dear love, in thee!\r\n      It is thy smile that makes the chamber still;\r\n      It is thy breath that fills the scented air;\r\n      The light around is borrowed from thy hair,\r\n      And all things else are subject to thy will,\r\n      And I am so bewildered in this deep\r\n      Ambrosial calm, and passionate atmosphere,\r\n      I know not whether I am dreaming here,\r\n          Or in the world of Sleep!\r\n\r\n    XI.\r\n\r\n          My eyes are full of tears,\r\n          My heart is full of pain,\r\n          To wake, as now, again,\r\n    And walk, as in my youth, the wilderness of Years!\r\n      No more!

OAKEY HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n     _How the Brooklet was born; and lodged; and wandered off one\r\n     rainy day._\r\n\r\nThere was once a Brooklet born of a modest spring that circled through a\r\nsmiling meadow. All the hours of the Spring, and the Summer, and the\r\nAutumn, kept she her musical round; greeting the sun at his rising,\r\ntogether with the meadow-larks which came to dip their beaks in the\r\nsparkling water-drops; and singing to the moon and stars all night, as\r\nshe bore their features within her bosom, in grateful remembrance of\r\ntheir beauty. The laborer in the field hard by often came to visit her,\r\nand wet his honest, toil-browned brow with her cooling drops; and often,\r\ntoo, the laborer's daughter came at sunset time to sit by a mossy stone,\r\nwith so lovely a face that the Brooklet, as she mirrored the features of\r\nthe beautiful visitor, leaped about the pebbles with ripplings of\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nAnd so this Brooklet lived on, only ceasing her merry flow and circling\r\njourney when the bushes by her side became white with snow, and when the\r\nrabbits from the brushwood fence at her head came out to stand upon the\r\nslippery casing that the Brooklet often saw spreading over her, and\r\nshutting out the warm sunshine by day, and at nightfall blurring the\r\nradiance of moon and stars.\r\n\r\nOne stormy spring day the Brooklet seemed to rise higher among the twigs\r\nof the alder-bushes than ever before; the rain came down faster and\r\nheavier, and beat into her bosom, until her tiny waves were rough and\r\nsore with pain, and she was fain to nestle closer to the sedgy grass\r\nthat now bent lowly to the pebbles at the roots. Growing higher every\r\nminute was the Brooklet; and frightened somewhat, and longing for the\r\nsunlight, or the laborer, and for the lovely daughter's face to cheer\r\nher up, she looked off over a track of country wider and greener than\r\nshe had ever seen before. And so the Brooklet, all frightened as she\r\nwas, said to herself, \"I'll run along a bit into this country spot, so\r\nwide and green, and maybe I shall find the sunlight and the lovely\r\nface.\"\r\n\r\nFaster came the rain; and so the Brooklet, leaping wildly over a rock\r\nwhose top until then her eyes had never seen, went flowing on upon this\r\ncountry spot, so wide and green. The new sights coming in view at every\r\nbound quite made the Brooklet forget her terrors from the beating rain;\r\nshe was pained no longer by the heavy drops, but soothed herself among\r\nthe velvet grass; and turned between little flowers scarcely above the\r\nground, and which, as she passed them, seemed to be as frightened by the\r\nwind and rain as herself had been before the meadow was left behind.\r\n\r\nThe Brooklet had thus run on until she saw the country spot so wide and\r\ngreen was well passed over, and trees and bushes, darker and thicker\r\nthan she had ever known before, were close at hand. And while she\r\nthought of stopping in her way and going back, she heard not far before\r\nan echo of a sound most like unto her own; and so kept on to find it\r\nout. Clearer and louder increased the sound, as now through mouldy\r\nleaves and dark thickets, and under decayed logs and insect-burrowed\r\nmoss, she kept a course, until presently, over a fallen tree, she saw a\r\nBrooklet, larger, wider, and evidently much older than herself, which,\r\non her near approach, ran by the fallen tree's side, and said, \"Good\r\nmorning, sister: what is so delicate a being, as you seem to be, doing\r\nin this dark forest?\"\r\n\r\nThe wanderer Brooklet became silent with wonder. She had never been\r\naddressed before, though often trying to talk with the laborer, and to\r\nthe lovely face of her meadow acquaintance, without the slightest notice\r\nupon their part of the overtures.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, sister, I say,\" was repeated over the fallen tree. \"Where\r\nare you going at so slow a pace? Come over, and let us talk a bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot, for I am terribly frightened, and I've lost my way. I want to\r\nquit this dark place, and go where I can hear the lark again, and see\r\nthe pretty face which used to look at mine when I was circling in yonder\r\nmeadow, now, I fear, far, far behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Larks and pretty faces, indeed! Why what a spooney sister, you are, to\r\nbe sure. I'll show you more birds than ever you heard sing before, and\r\nprettier faces than ever you saw before.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, I must go back,\" replied the wanderer; \"I have come too far\r\nalready, and see, the rain has almost ceased.\"\r\n\r\n\"More's the pity for that,\" returned the other; \"the faster it rains the\r\nfaster I go, and that is what I want. I have left my family brooks a\r\nlong time since, and I'm going on my travels to be somebody. I'm tired\r\nof my lonesome life among the meadows. I'm the _ambitious Brooklet_.\r\nCome over, then, and go along; we'll travel the faster in company.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not ambitious; and as you may see, I cannot come.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're almost to the log top now. I'll kiss you soon,\" triumphed the\r\nambitious Brooklet, circling gayly round a tuft of green.\r\n\r\nIt must have been the terrible rain, or the fright of her dark\r\njourneying place, that had taken her strength away:--the wandering\r\nBrooklet felt that it must be: for now her strength of will was almost\r\ngone. Nearer the log top came in view, until with a bound she swept its\r\npolished surface, and with a dash came over upon the ambitious Brooklet.\r\n\r\n\"Good! that's the way to do it; now we shall journey gayly on,\" said the\r\nlatter, \"I have lost much time in stopping here, and there are such rare\r\nsights ahead!\"\r\n\r\nThe wanderer felt the oddest sensations she had ever known, and said,\r\n\"Sister--ambitious sister--how much warmer than I are you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you are young, I suppose--fresh from the icy spring. But journey\r\non more southward yet, away from these dark trees, and you'll be warmer\r\nyet; come, I say.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like your feel; but then I shall be lost, I know I shall; and so I'll\r\nstay behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"You cannot; for, ambitious as I am, I want your help. See how much\r\nfaster we travel together when your strength is joined to mine; and I'm\r\nthe strongest, and you can't go back.\"\r\n\r\nThe wandering Brooklet looked fearfully around, and saw indeed that the\r\nlog she had leaped was now fast fading away, and felt that her strength\r\nbecame less and less as the ambitious Brooklet clung closer to her side.\r\n\r\nPresently they came in sight of a ledge of rocks. \"Oh, this is rare\r\nindeed!\" said the stronger sister Brooklet, \"Let us pause a bit for\r\nbreath, and then for a merry leap adown the valley of pines you see\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\nThe Brooklets stopped, and became stronger, and leaped over the rocks;\r\nthe one with an exulting bound--the other carried tremblingly along.\r\n\r\nThe leap was a long one, and a hard one; for there were craggy rocks\r\nbeneath, which they had not seen. And the ambitious Brooklet cried\r\nsharply and loudly--foaming in her rage as she went between the stony\r\npoints, and quite forgetting her weaker sister in her pain. The latter\r\nwas sorely injured too, and cut into little foam-bits; but she kept her\r\nwits about her, looking around everywhere for a place to rest. Soon she\r\nespied one--a little bowl of marshy ground, hemmed in by rocks, into\r\nwhich a straggling dropping from the chasm above slowly came.\r\n\r\n\"Here will I go and rest,\" she said. So waiting for the ambitious\r\nBrooklet to get far out of sight, she collected all her strength for a\r\njump into the bowl, where the drops came sparkling in. There was no need\r\nfor fear of the sister on before; her she heard going over rock after\r\nrock, crying and wailing in her craggy journey. Then the tired wanderer,\r\nwith a violent effort of her exhausted strength, jumped a rock and fell\r\npanting into the marshy bowl.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n     _How the Brooklet lived on in her new quarters; and how\r\n     misfortune made her discontented._\r\n\r\nThe dropping of the water from the rocks above her new abode, was cold\r\nand grateful to the Brooklet in her fevered state. It made her think of\r\nthe spring she came from; and so of the meadow; and the alder-bushes;\r\nand the lovely face a weary way off now she knew, and fenced away from\r\nher return by cruel jagged rocks.\r\n\r\nDays passed by; and the sun came out all brightly. And the moon and\r\nstars were seen again; and larger and sweeter birds than she had heard\r\nbefore, now perched upon the trees about, warbling and chirruping from\r\nday-break to twilight. So the time passed on. The wanderer began to feel\r\nunsettled in her solitude. But there was no return by the path she came;\r\nstill were the sharp rocks seen above; and still she felt a twinge of\r\npain when thinking of her weary journey on that rainy day. Often too she\r\nthought of her ambitious sister, wondering where she was now and what\r\nshe was about; and sometimes she almost fancied she would have been\r\nhappier had she gone along. It was quite evident to herself that she was\r\ngetting discontented.\r\n\r\nThere was one pleasure she prized much. Following in the train of the\r\nambitious Brooklet had been a score of fishes, which, frightened by the\r\nleap upon the jagged rocks, had staid behind with the timid wanderer,\r\nuntil they became part of her family in the new retreat. Overlooking,\r\nand enjoying the gambols of these fish, the discontented Brooklet often\r\namused herself. Observing how when the sun came slanting through the\r\nsides of the foliage about, they would dart out from their hiding-places\r\nin the old dead leaves at the feet of the Brooklet, and so jump up to\r\ngreet the warming rays: or how, when a fly fell down from the\r\noverhanging boughs, and tried to swim away, they would jump to nab a bit\r\nof lunch, scrabbling and tugging as they went; or how, when the largest\r\nfish of all threw off his dignity, and played with them at hide and seek\r\nunder the foot-deep bottom of mud, they would all shoot about her\r\nlife-blood drops without regard to the angles of pain their fins would\r\nleave behind!\r\n\r\nThus the summer-time came on, and was passing by, when one day the\r\nBrooklet felt a shadow upon her, and looked up to see the cause--when\r\nhigh upon the rocks above, there stood a bright-eyed boy, with curling\r\nlocks that blew about in golden beauty with the breeze. In his hand he\r\nheld a little stick, which he turned over from time to time, and would\r\ntake up and then lay it down, as if preparing for something wonderful.\r\nThe curiosity of the Brooklet was aroused to know what he could mean,\r\nwhen presently she saw him sit upon the rock, and from the stick drop\r\ndown upon her face a worm, which when the fishes saw they darted out to\r\neat.\r\n\r\n\"It is a beautiful boy; and a kind boy,\" said the artless Brook unto\r\nherself; \"and he has come to feed the little fishes with a worm. I have\r\nnot seen one since I left my little meadow on that rainy day. How like\r\nthe lovely face I used to see, is his which now looks down.\"\r\n\r\nWhile thus the Brook was soliloquizing, a fish more cunning than the\r\nrest, had seized the worm within his mouth, and was swimming away to his\r\nfavorite hole by an old willow stump to there complete a meal. He was\r\njust entering it, when the Brook saw him suddenly flash from her\r\nembrace, floundering and pulling as he went up, up through the air, unto\r\nthe mossy bank above the rock from which fell the shadow of the boy. And\r\nnow the Brook, more curious than ever, saw the face so like the\r\nlaborer's daughter overspread with smiles as the tiny hands grasped the\r\nfish, and with a wrench tore out the worm from his gills, a piece of\r\nwhich fell on the Brook athwart the shadow of the laugher.\r\n\r\n\"What a fine one!\" said the boy, and started up;--started up to slip\r\nagainst a smooth worn stone, and fall over the rock into the Brook,\r\nclose by the willow stump; the captive fish held tightly as he went, but\r\nslipping from the falling grasp into its welcome element once more.\r\n\r\nThe Brook had never felt so hard a blow before. The rain and hail were\r\nnothing to this. It made her splash and leap and swell against the rocky\r\nbank, until she could have called with pain.\r\n\r\nHow still the boy laid on her breast! his head against the willow stump,\r\nover which there trickled a tiny purple stream smaller than the\r\nspring-drops from the rock! How richly his golden locks floated upon the\r\nBrook! but how widely strained his bright blue eyes glaring at the sky\r\nand tree-tops above, and how he gasped from his mouth; a mouth so like\r\nthe one the laborer had often prest in harvest-time to the Brook, when\r\nit was yet circling in the meadow! The Brook said to herself, \"I will\r\nput some of my ripples into this mouth, as I have seen the laborer do;\r\nperhaps, like him, it will make his eye sparkle, and send him away\r\nagain; for he lies heavy on my breast.\" And so the ripples went into the\r\nopened mouth by dozens; but the blue sky and tree-tops faded from his\r\neyes, and the lips lost their bright color, and the purple trickling on\r\nthe willow stump grew thick and settled into a dark pool.\r\n\r\nAll night the dead boy lay upon the breast of the Brook; and the fishes\r\nplayed around him, wondering what it was; and the little insects hopped\r\nover him at early sunlight; until the purple pool dried up, and only\r\nleft a stain behind.\r\n\r\nAnd soon the Brook heard the hum of voices sounding over the rocks, as\r\nshe listened from her solitude; and soon more shadows fell upon her\r\nface. Then looking up she saw the laborer once again; and the Brook\r\nrejoiced to think perhaps she was going back again into her pleasant\r\nmeadow. He had taken up the stick the boy had used; and was looking down\r\nbelow upon the Brook, as the face--the lovely face, with more of the old\r\nsorrow in it--of the laborer's daughter, raised itself above his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"My brother!--drowned and dead!--and no more to come home alive to share\r\nhis sister's home.\"\r\n\r\nThis the Brook heard, and the fishes swam away into their holes, as\r\npiercing, sorrowful human tones mingled with the passing breeze; and\r\nthey struck deeper into the willow roots as a pair of brawny arms\r\nreadied out and caught the dead boy, and carried him away.\r\n\r\nThe boy was gone, but the stain was there; and still a weight remained\r\nupon the Brook. For still day after day a shadow fell upon her, and the\r\nBrook looking up beheld the lovely but mournful face of the sorrowing\r\nsister, who would sit upon the mossy bank and sigh a sob; kissing a lock\r\nof golden hair the while. And heavier grew the weight on the breast of\r\nthe Brook, as scalding tears fell from the rock above upon her face.\r\n\r\nAnd now the Brook again became discontented: and thought of her\r\nambitious sister; and what might have happened had she followed after on\r\na weary round of travels. The old meadow and the alders were out of the\r\nquestion now: for the winter was coming on, and the laborer and the\r\nlovely face would no more come to her side; and if they did they would\r\nsing no more, but sigh and sob, and look so sad, as now, upon the mossy\r\nrock above.\r\n\r\nThe summer weather was long over; and the leaves were showering down,\r\nand had quite hidden the clouds and blue sky, and moon and stars from\r\nthe sight of the Brook. The birds had ceased to sit and warble on the\r\ntrees above. The breezes ceased their music, and instead were heard the\r\nhoarse notes of the Autumn wind.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     _How the Brooklet and the Mountain-Torrent met._\r\n\r\nOne day the leaves thickened more than ever over the Brook, and, as she\r\npeeped between, she saw the clouds were heavier and darker than usual.\r\nThe wind roared louder, and the trees which grew so high above her bent\r\ndown their branches until they brushed her face with their trailing. And\r\nsoon the rain began to fall in torrents; and it fell and fell all day;\r\nall night too. Then the Brook rejoiced to think the leaves which she had\r\nbeen angry with before for choking her, protected from the pattering\r\nstrokes. And soon the Brook heard a sound, like that made by her\r\nambitious sister in the spring-time;--nearer and nearer it came; through\r\nthe trees; over the rocks; tearing, splashing, dashing, and foaming at a\r\ndireful rate.\r\n\r\n\"It is my ambitious sister come for me. I'm glad,\" said the discontented\r\nBrook.\r\n\r\n\"Glad of what?\" exclaimed a roaring voice, coming over the rock, and\r\nsweeping away the leaves as if they had been a mere handful; and\r\ncovering up the ugly purple stain upon the willow stump. \"Ain't I a\r\nfamous fellow, though? When once my blood is up, can't I go on and\r\nfrighten people? Can't I mine out the earth, and sweep along big trees\r\nlike boats? Can't I tumble down the rocks that dare to stop my path?\r\nCan't I drown men and boys, and all the cattle in the land? I've\r\nswallowed a dozen haystacks for my breakfast, and killed the finest\r\nmill-dam over the world this morning. I said I would as soon as winter\r\ncame, when they dammed me up last spring, so many miles away! Oh, such a\r\nmass of stone and timber which they put up to fret me in my path; and\r\nwhat a joke to think this solid mass is scattered through the land since\r\nyesternight, and I am free once more.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is not my ambitious sister! no indeed,\" murmured the Brook.\r\n\r\n\"Why here is a little Brook,\" continued the voice, \"a dainty, prudish,\r\nmodest Brook, collected in a hole to die! Come out, my fair one! I will\r\nwed thee, as I have wedded fifty thousand of your sex in my short day!\r\nCome out; no fear; if I am the Mountain-Torrent, I'm not so great a\r\nmonster as they say, especially to hurt a modest Brook.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying the Mountain-Torrent caught up the shrinking Brook in his\r\npowerful embrace, and away they hurried through the very heart of the\r\nforest, miles and miles below.\r\n\r\n\"This, this is life indeed,\" said the wedded Brook, once more a wanderer\r\nover the land, as with a thousand other Brooks they travelled on for\r\nmany hours with impetuous speed, making dreadful havoc everywhere they\r\ntouched. Havoc among the farmers and the villagers, who fought them inch\r\nby inch, with sticks and trees, and mounds of stone and clay, all which\r\nthey licked up and swallowed, as if they had been pebbles and clumps of\r\nleaves. Havoc with the Creeks upon the route, who dared to scorn their\r\novertures, and wed the Torrent, willingly; for spurning the placid,\r\nhumble Creeks one side, they tore along their paths, and vented their\r\nfury on the bridges overhead, bringing down in general destruction,\r\nturnpikes and railroads with their pressing weight of travel.\r\n\r\nHavoc to themselves!\r\n\r\nFor, tearing on so madly, the Mountain-Torrent, after a while, perceived\r\nhis strength to fail, and his endurance to give out. But still he\r\nhurried on, though feebly, in hopes to meet more Brooks, perhaps a Lake,\r\nand so recruit himself the while. The wedded Brook was wearied too--a\r\nlittle; not much; at first the Mountain-Torrent had held her tightly in\r\nembrace, and carried her along with scarcely an effort; but as he\r\nwearied himself, much of the toil was thrown upon the Brook, and she was\r\ncompelled to help herself. On went the Torrent, weaker every step, until\r\nat last he stopped and said:\r\n\r\n\"Oh wedded Brook! my strength is gone; here must I pause; but you go on.\r\nPerhaps before long I shall meet you again. Go slowly; over the meadows\r\nand through the villages make me a path; I'll know which way you went.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so they parted; and so the lonely Brook meandered on, and finding\r\nout a bubbling spring, was well recruited for the journey. As she went\r\nshe heard, across a little knoll, a remembered voice, and stopped. \"I\r\nknow you, sister Brook,\" cried out the voice, \"go on a bit and turn\r\ntowards your left, and there I'll meet you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd towards the left the lonely Brook met her ambitious sister. She was\r\nviolent no more; but sober and sedate; calm as the evening sky reflected\r\nfrom her face.\r\n\r\n\"I'm the 'ambitious one,'\" said she, \"ambitious yet, though all my\r\nstrength has departed. Here on this spot was I caught and fastened up.\r\nThey darkened my daylight with that smoking monster yonder, and killed\r\nmy peace of mind with such a horrid din and clang, I've not a morsel of\r\nenergy left. I'm a factory slave; and so are you, too, for that matter,\r\nnow! Don't start; it's not my fault--the way that you were going on, you\r\nwould have brought up in the Pond below, where there is yet another\r\nsmoking monster; only worse than this of mine. The Pond there is a\r\nhorrid fellow; poisoning with some horrid purple dye: I've seen him\r\noften when I venture near the dam and look below.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sister, take courage,\" cried the other Brook. \"I'm glad I met you. I'm\r\nambitious too, for I was lately wedded to a glorious fellow, and have\r\nbeen on such a glorious tour: scampering over all the land. He calls\r\nhimself the 'Mountain-Torrent.' He is now behind a mile or so, and may\r\nbe down upon us before long, to free us from this distressing\r\nimprisonment you speak of.\"\r\n\r\nThe monster smoked on; and the clanging din about maddened all the air.\r\nHuge wheels went racking and rumbling under huge brick walls. And day by\r\nday, a minute at a time, some youthful faces, pale and shadowy, looked\r\nwistfully upon the landscape below. But little knew the monster, and the\r\nclanging din, and racking wheels; and little hoped the shadowy faces of\r\nwhat the Brooklets plotted at the very factory door.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n     _How the Mountain-Torrent freed the Brooks; and their fate._\r\n\r\nThe frost dropped on the Brooks, and once more blurred the moon and\r\nstars, and shut the sunlight out; and starred a thousand jewels on the\r\nmill-dam's brow; and sparkled a myriad icicles from the rumbling wheels.\r\nFar away into the country it spread a white mantle, and froze into the\r\nvery heart of all the Ponds and Creeks above. And then the sun came out\r\nand shone so brightly; and then the clouds over-covered it, and the rain\r\ncame pattering down as of the olden time, when first its peltings stung\r\nthe meadow Brook and tempted her to roam. And higher swelled the Brooks\r\nbehind their mill-dam prison, and sent more of their life-blood to\r\nrefresh the poisoned Pond below.\r\n\r\n\"I am getting stronger; I am very strong to-day, sister Brook,\" said the\r\nambitious one. \"I think that with our efforts now united, we can push\r\nthis mill-dam over and escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait for my darling Mountain-Torrent. I hear him on his way; he follows\r\nafter us. And see down yonder hill-side how he tears along; and hark!\r\nhow gladly, as he sees us from his rocky bed, he roars a song of\r\ncourage.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the sister Brooks triumphed together as they saw the keepers of the\r\nsmoking monster cease their clanging din, and rush for timbers to uphold\r\nthe dam; and fly about with tools that were but baby toys for what was\r\ncoming now.\r\n\r\n\"Bring trees; bring stones; bring every thing,\" cried out the Brooks,\r\nas they saw the Mountain-Torrent come rushing nearer on, sweeping away\r\nthe fences, and ploughing out a path more fitting for his travels than\r\nthe brookside one he kept in view.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome, my fair ones,\" roared he, as with heavy timbers in his maw he\r\ncaught the Brooks again in strong embrace, and dashing at the smoking\r\nmonster, knocked him down at once. Down came the mill-dam with an\r\nearthquake noise; the din upon the air was not of clanging tools and\r\nhammer stroke; the wheels were racking and rumbling, not beneath brick\r\nwalls, but over the rocks and ruined factories below; while the pale and\r\nshadowy faces looked no longer wistfully on the landscape, but madly\r\nrushed about to spread the tale of ruin through the land.\r\n\r\nThe same old thing! The same old journey over the country. The same old\r\nhavoc as they went. But the strength of a thousand Brooks seemed given\r\nto the Mountain-Torrent as, looking miles away, he saw a wide expanse of\r\nwater fringed with brown and bluish lines. \"It is the Ocean, fair ones,\"\r\ncried he; \"when your feeble sights shall see it, bless my power, for at\r\nlength we reach a home no art of man can invade to fetter us or bind us\r\ndown. Ten millions of our species mingle there; in small harmony it is\r\ntrue, but better fight among ourselves than ever thus to wage a war with\r\nman. Now too approaches the time of our revenge: we'll take his life;\r\nwe'll sink his ships; we'll break his boasted wealth into uncounted\r\natoms, and scatter it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Brooks trembled in the strong grasp of the Mountain-Torrent to hear\r\nthe vehemence with which he spoke these threatening words; but lost\r\ntheir fears in greater astonishment, as now they neared the ocean waste,\r\nfringed with the lines of brown and blue of which he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Why, sister, what a noise!\" cried one of the Brooks, \"our own is not to\r\nbe heard.\"\r\n\r\n\"See what a dreadful wall appears to rise and fall as we approach,\"\r\nanswered the other. And they both clung closer to the embrace of the\r\nTorrent as he crossed the beach they reached at last, and plunged, with\r\nsticks and stones and all, upon the wall of foam and sand, which parted\r\nas the Mountain-Torrent and the Brooks joined forces with old _Ocean's_\r\nsolemn waste.\r\n\r\nIn an instant the meadow-born Brook writhed in pain, pressed on by\r\nthousands of Mountain-Torrents every way at once. She foamed and fought,\r\nand fought and foamed; under and over, up and below she plunged, but no\r\nescape; one weary work for ages yet to come!\r\n\r\n\"Revenge once more! Gather and rage! Dash to ruin ships and sailors!\"\r\ngrowled a tone which made the writhing Brook tremble into a million\r\nfoam-beads, as simultaneously a roaring Tempest clattered by with\r\nthunder and lightning in its train, while a clashing hiss, as of\r\nsomething rushing madly through the water, bade the Brook--the sea-slave\r\nBrook--look up.\r\n\r\nNo time for thought; for still the tone was heard, \"Revenge once more!\r\ngather and rage! dash to ruin ship and sailors!\" And still the tempest\r\nclattered, and still the hissing of the gallant ship's prow was heard\r\ncleaving the maddened waves. On, on! a dash; a crash; a march of\r\nmaddening waves; a stunning tempest howl, and then the hiss was heard no\r\nmore. But far and wide were hurried and mashed in one chaotic mass the\r\nfragments of the gallant ship.\r\n\r\n\"How wise he is; how true my Mountain-Torrent spoke,\" thought the\r\nfrightened sea-slave Brook, as the clattering tempest, with thunder and\r\nlightning in its train, passed out of sight and hearing leagues beyond.\r\n\"And now I'll rest me on this sandy beach, for this ambitious life is\r\nwearisome indeed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she nestled closely to a rock, and so crept into grateful rest. But\r\nas she lay, she looked beyond her sandy bed to see the lovely face of\r\nher early meadow life, when she was but a humble Brook. Pale and ghastly\r\nit lay upon a rounded stone; the hair floating out like fairy circles\r\nfrom the marked brow, and on the temple such a purple thickened stain as\r\nonce had been upon the willow stump.\r\n\r\nThe Brook came by her side and watched her gently as she lay. Then going\r\nfarther out, the Brook brought strings of sea-weed, and strung them\r\ngayly and softly round her form, and watched her thus again. \"Here will\r\nI stay,\" thought the Brook, \"and fancy I am still in the sunlight meadow\r\nbefore I wandered forth into ambitious company. There's nought but\r\ntrouble and pain crossed my path since the rainy days of the latest\r\nspring-time. Here will I stay, and ever mourn that I listened to\r\nambitious counselling.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAST CASE OF THE SUPERNATURAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nA writer in the January number of _Fraser's Magazine_, at the conclusion\r\nof a tale crammed with the intensest horrors, presents us with one\r\ninstance in which the architect of such machinery was foiled.\r\n\r\nWhen the recital was finished, and the company were well-nigh breathless\r\nwith its skilfully cumulative terror, cried Tremenheere--\r\n\r\n\"Humph! that is rather an uncomfortable story to go to bed upon.\"\r\n\r\nAnd presently--\r\n\r\n\"You have been lately in Spain, Melton; what news from Seville?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" replied Melton, \"you must have heard of Don Juan de Murana, of\r\nterrible memory?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not we,\" said they.\r\n\r\n\"One gloomy evening Don Juan de Murana was returning along the quay\r\nwhere the Golden Tower looks down upon the Guadalquivir, so lost in\r\nthought that it was some time before he perceived that his cigar had\r\ngone out, though he was one of the most determined smokers in Spain. He\r\nlooked about him, and beheld on the other side of the broad river an\r\nindividual whose brilliant cigar sparkled like a star of the first\r\nmagnitude at every aspiration.\r\n\r\n\"Don Juan, who, thanks to the terror which he had inspired, was\r\naccustomed to see all the world obedient to his caprices, shouted to the\r\nsmoker to come across the river and give him a light.\r\n\r\n\"The smoker, without taking that trouble, stretched out his arm towards\r\nthe Don, and so effectually that it traversed the river like a bridge,\r\nand presented to Don Juan a glowing cigar, which smelt most abominably\r\nof sulphur.\r\n\r\n\"If Don Juan felt something like a rising shudder, he suppressed it,\r\ncoolly lighted his own cigar at that of the smoker, and went on his way,\r\nsinging, _Los Toros a la puerta_.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who was the smoker?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who could he be, but the Prince of Darkness in person, who had laid a\r\nwager with Pluto that he would frighten Don Juan De Murana, and went\r\nback to his place furious at having lost?\r\n\r\n\"If you would learn more of Don Juan de Murana, how he went to his own\r\nfuneral, and died at last in the odor of sanctity, read that most\r\nspirited series of letters, _De Paris a Cadix_, wherein Alexander Dumas\r\nhas surpassed himself. And now, Good night!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STORY WITHOUT A NAME[M]\r\n\r\nWritten For The International Monthly Magazine\r\n\r\nBY G. P. R. JAMES, ESQ.\r\n\r\n_Continued from Page 348._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nOccasionally in the life of man, as in the life of the\r\nworld--History--or in the course of a stream towards the sea, come quiet\r\nlapses, sunny and calm, reflecting nothing but the still motionless\r\nobjects around, or the blue sky and moving clouds above. Often too we\r\nfind that this tranquil expanse of silent water follows quickly after\r\nsome more rapid movement, comes close upon some spot where a dashing\r\nrapid has diversified the scene, or a cataract, in roar and confusion\r\nand sparkling terror, has broken the course of the stream.\r\n\r\nSuch a still pause, silent of action--if I may use the term--followed\r\nthe events which I have related in the last chapter, extending over a\r\nperiod of nearly six months. Nothing happened worthy of any minute\r\ndetail. Peace and tranquillity dwelt in the various households which I\r\nhave noticed in the course of this story, enlivened in that of Sir\r\nPhilip Hastings by the gay spirit of Emily Hastings, although somewhat\r\nshadowed by the sterner character of her father; and in the household of\r\nMrs. Hazleton brightened by the light of hope, and the fair prospect of\r\nsuccess in all her schemes which for a certain time continued to open\r\nbefore her.\r\n\r\nMr. Marlow only spent two days at her house, and then went away to\r\nLondon, but whatever effect her beauty might have produced upon him, his\r\nsociety, brief as it was, served but to confirm her feelings towards\r\nhim, and before he left her, she had made up her mind fully and\r\nentirely, with her characteristic vigor and strength of resolution, that\r\nher marriage with Mr. Marlow was an event which must and should be.\r\nThere was under this conviction, but not the less strong, not the less\r\nenergetic, not the less vehement, for being concealed even from\r\nherself--a resolution that no sacrifice, no fear, no hesitation at any\r\ncourse, should stand in the way of her purpose. She did not anticipate\r\nmany difficulties certainly; for Mr. Marlow clearly admired her; but the\r\nresolution was, that if difficulties should arise, she would overcome\r\nthem at all cost. Hers was one of those characters of which the world\r\nmakes its tragedies, having within itself passions too strong and deep\r\nto be frequently excited--as the more profound waters which rise into\r\nmountains when once in motion require a hurricane to still\r\nthem--together with that energetic will, that fixed unbending\r\ndetermination, which like the outburst of a torrent from the hills,\r\nsweeps away all before it. But let it be ever remembered that her\r\nenergies were exerted upon herself as well as upon others, not in\r\nchecking passion, not in limiting desire, but in guarding scrupulously\r\nevery external appearance, guiding every thought and act with careful\r\nart towards its destined object. Mrs. Hazleton suffered Mr. Marlow to be\r\nin London more than a month before she followed to conclude the mere\r\nmatters of business between them. It cost her a great struggle with\r\nherself, but in that struggle she was successful, and when at length she\r\nwent, she had several interviews with him. Circumstances--that great\r\nenemy of schemes, was against her. Sometimes lawyers were present at\r\ntheir interviews, sometimes impertinent friends; but Mrs. Hazleton did\r\nnot much care: she trusted to the time he was speedily about to pass in\r\nthe country, for the full effect, and in the meantime took care that\r\nnothing but the golden side of the shield should be presented to her\r\nknight.\r\n\r\nThe continent was at that time open to Englishmen for a short period,\r\nand Mr. Marlow expressed his determination of going to the Court of\r\nVersailles for a month or six weeks before he came down to take\r\npossession of Hartwell place, everything now having been settled between\r\nthem in regard to business.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton did not like his determination, yet she did not much fear\r\nthe result; for Mr. Marlow was preeminently English, and never likely to\r\nweal a French woman. Still she resolved that he should see her under\r\nanother aspect before he went. She was a great favorite of the Court of\r\nthose days; her station, her wealth, her beauty, and her grace rendered\r\nher a brightness and an ornament wherever she came. She was invited to\r\none of the more private though not less splendid assemblies at the\r\nPalace, and she contrived that Mr. Marlow should be invited also, though\r\nneither by nature or habit a courtier. She obtained the invitation for\r\nhim skilfully, saying to the Royal Personage of whom she asked it, that\r\nas he won a lawsuit against her, she wished to show him that she bore no\r\nmalice. He went, and found her the brightest in the brilliant scene; the\r\ngreat and the proud, the handsome and the gay, all bending down and\r\nworshipping, all striving for a smile, and obtaining it but scantily.\r\nShe smiled upon _him_, however, not sufficiently to attract remark from\r\nothers, but quite sufficiently to mark a strong distinction for his own\r\neyes, if he had chosen to use them. He went away to France, and Mrs.\r\nHazleton returned to the country; the winter passed with her in\r\narranging his house for him; and, in so doing, she often had to write to\r\nhim. His replies were always prompt, kind, and grateful; and at length\r\ncame the spring, and the pleasant tidings that he was on his way back to\r\nhis beloved England.\r\n\r\nAlas for human expectation! Alas for the gay day-dream of\r\nyouth--maturity--middle age--old age--for they have all their daydreams!\r\nEvery passion which besets man from the cradle to the grave has its own\r\nvisionary expectations. Each creature, each animal, from the tiger to\r\nthe beetle, has its besetting insect, which preys upon it, gnaws it,\r\nirritates it, and so have all the ages of the soul and of the heart.\r\nAlas for human speculation of all kinds! Alas for every hope and\r\naspiration! for those that are pure and high, but, growing out of earth,\r\nbear within themselves the bitter seeds of disappointment; and those\r\nthat are dark or low produce the germ of the most poisonous hybrid,\r\nwhere disappointment is united with remorse.\r\n\r\nHappy is the man that expecteth nothing, for verily he shall not be\r\ndisappointed! It is a quaint old saying; and could philosophy ever stem\r\nthe course of God's will, it would be one which, well followed, might\r\nsecure to man some greater portion of mortal peace than he possesses.\r\nBut to aspire was the ordinance of God; and, viewed rightly, the\r\nwithering of the flowers upon each footstep we have taken upwards, is no\r\ndiscouragement; for if we shape our path aright, there is a wreath of\r\nbright blossoms crowning each craggy peak before us, as we ascend to\r\nsnatch the garland of immortal glory, placed just beyond the last awful\r\nleap of death.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton's aspirations, however, were all earthly. She thought of\r\nlittle beyond this life. She had never been taught so to think. There\r\nare some who are led astray from the path of noble daring, to others as\r\ndifficult and more intricate, by some loud shout of passion on the right\r\nor on the left--and seek in vain to return; some who, misled by an\r\napparent similarity in the course of two paths, although the finger post\r\nsays, \"Thus shalt thou go!\" think that the way so plainly beaten, and so\r\nseemingly easy, must surely lead them to the same point. Others again\r\nnever learn to read the right path from the wrong (and she was one),\r\nwhile others shut their eyes to all direction, fix their gaze upon the\r\nsummit, and strain up, now amidst flowers and now amidst thorns, till\r\nthey are cast back from the face of some steep precipice, to perish in\r\nthe descent or at the foot.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton's aspirations were all earthly; and that was the secret of\r\nher only want in beauty. That divine form, that resplendent face, beamed\r\nwith every earthly grace: sparkled forth mind and intellect in every\r\nglance, but they were wanting in soul, in spirit, and in heart. Life was\r\nthere, but the life of life, the intense flame of immortal, over-earthly\r\nintelligence, was wanting. She might be the grandest animal that ever\r\nwas seen, the most bright and capable intellect that ever dealt with\r\nmortal things; but the fine golden chain which leads on the electric\r\nfire from intellectual eminence to spiritual preeminence, from mind to\r\nsoul, from earth to heaven, was wanting, or had been broken. Her\r\nloveliness none could doubt, her charm of manner none could deny, her\r\nintellectual superiority all admitted, her womanly softness added a\r\ngrace beyond them all; but there was one grace wanting--the grace of a\r\nhigh, holy soul, which, in those who have it, be they fair, be they\r\nugly, pours forth as an emanation from every look and every action, and\r\nsurrounds them with a cloud of radiance, faintly imaged by the artist's\r\nglory round a saint.\r\n\r\nAlas for human aspirations! Alas for the expectations of this fair frail\r\ncreature! How eagerly she thought of Mr. Marlow's return! how she had\r\nanticipated their meeting again! How she had calculated upon all that\r\nwould be said and done during the next few weeks! The first news she\r\nreceived was that he had arrived, and with a few servants had taken\r\npossession of his new dwelling. She remained all day in her own house;\r\nshe ordered no carriage; she took no walk: she tried to read; she played\r\nupon various instruments of music; she thought each instant he would\r\ncome, at least for a few minutes, to thank her for all the care she had\r\nbestowed to make his habitation comfortable. The sun gilded the west;\r\nthe melancholy moon rose up in solemn splendor; the hours passed by, and\r\nhe came not.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, she heard that he had ridden over to the house of Sir\r\nPhilip Hastings, and indignation warred with love in her bosom. She\r\nthought he must certainly come that day, and she resolved angrily to\r\nupbraid him for his want of courtesy. Luckily, however, for her, he did\r\nnot come that day; and a sort of melancholy took possession of her.\r\nLuckily, I say; for when passion takes hold of a scheme it is generally\r\nsure to shake it to pieces, and that melancholy loosens the grasp of\r\npassion for a time. The next day he did come, and with an air so easy\r\nand unconscious of offence as almost to provoke her into vehemence\r\nagain. He knew not what she felt--he had no idea of how he had been\r\nlooked for. He was as ignorant that she had ever thought of him as a\r\nhusband, as she was that he had ever compared her in his mind to his\r\nown mother.\r\n\r\nHe talked quietly, indifferently, of his having been over to the house\r\nof Sir Philip Hastings, adding merely--not as an excuse, but as a simple\r\nfact--that he had been unable to call there as he had promised before\r\nleaving the country. He dilated upon the kind reception he had met with\r\nfrom Lady Hastings, for Sir Philip was absent upon business; and he went\r\non to dwell rather largely upon the exceeding beauty and great grace of\r\nEmily Hastings.\r\n\r\nOh how Mrs. Hazleton hated her! It requires but a few drops of poison to\r\nenvenom a whole well.\r\n\r\nHe did worse: he proceeded to descant upon her character--upon the\r\nblended brightness and deep thought--upon the high-souled emotions and\r\nchild-like sparkle of her disposition--upon the simplicity and\r\ncomplexity, upon the many-sided splendor of her character, which, like\r\nthe cut diamond, reflected each ray of light in a thousand varied and\r\ndazzling hues. Oh how Mrs. Hazleton hated her--hated, because for the\r\nfirst time she began to fear. He had spoken to her in praise of another\r\nwoman--with loud encomiums too, with a brightened eye, and a look which\r\ntold her more than his words. These were signs not to be mistaken. They\r\ndid not show in the least that he loved Emily Hastings, and that she\r\nknew right well; but they showed that he did not love her; and there was\r\nthe poison in the cup.\r\n\r\nSo painful, so terrible was the sensation, that, with all her mastery\r\nover herself, she could not conceal the agony under which she writhed.\r\nShe became silent, grave, fell into fits of thought, which clouded the\r\nbroad brow, and made the fine-cut lip quiver. Mr. Marlow was surprised\r\nand grieved. He asked himself what could be the matter. Something had\r\nevidently made her sorrowful, and he could not trace the sorrow to its\r\nsource; for she carefully avoided uttering one word in depreciation of\r\nEmily Hastings. In this she showed no woman's spirit. She could have\r\nstabbed her, had the girl been there in her presence; but she would not\r\nscratch her. Petty spite was too low for her, too small for the\r\ncharacter of her mind. Hers was a heart capable of revenge, and would be\r\nsatisfied with nothing less.\r\n\r\nMr. Marlow soothed her, spoke to her kindly, tenderly, tried to lead her\r\nmind away, to amuse, to entertain her. Oh, it was all gall and\r\nbitterness to her. He might have cursed, abused, insulted her, without,\r\nperhaps--diminishing her love--certainly without inflicting half the\r\nanguish that was caused by his gentle words. It is impossible to tell\r\nall the varied emotions that went on in her heart--at least for me.\r\nShakspeare could have done it, but none less than Shakspeare. For a\r\nmoment she knew not whether she loved or hated him; but she soon felt\r\nand knew it was love; and the hate, like lightning striking a rock, and\r\nglancing from the solid stone to rend a sapling, all turned away from\r\nhim, to fall upon the head of poor unconscious Emily Hastings.\r\n\r\nThough she could not recover from the blow she had received, yet she\r\nsoon regained command over herself, conversed, smiled, banished\r\nabsorbing thoughts, answered calmly, pertinently, even spoke in her own\r\nbright, brilliant way, with a few more figures and ornaments of speech\r\nthan usual; for figures are things rather of the head than of the heart,\r\nand it was from the head that she was now speaking.\r\n\r\nAt length Mr. Marlow took his leave, and for the first time in life she\r\nwas glad he was gone.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton gave way to no burst of passion: she shed not a tear; she\r\nuttered no exclamation. That which was within her heart, was too intense\r\nfor any such ordinary expression. She seated herself at a table, leaned\r\nher head upon her hand, and fixed her eyes upon one bright spot in the\r\nmarquetry. There she sat for more than an entire hour, without a motion,\r\nand in the meantime what were the thoughts that passed through her\r\nbrain? We have shown the feelings of her heart enough.\r\n\r\nShe formed plans; she determined her course; she looked around for\r\nmeans. Various persons suggested themselves to her mind as instruments.\r\nThe three women, I have mentioned in a preceding chapter--the good sort\r\nof friends. But it was an agent she wanted, not a confidant. No, no,\r\nMrs. Hazleton knew better than to have a confidant. She was her own best\r\ncouncil-keeper, and she knew it. Nevertheless, these good ladies might\r\nserve to act in subordinate parts, and she assigned to each of them\r\ntheir position in her scheme with wonderful accuracy and skill. As she\r\ndid so, however, she remembered that it was by the advice of Mrs.\r\nWarmington that she had brought Mr. Marlow to Hartwell Place; and in her\r\nheart's secret chamber she gave her fair friend a goodly benediction.\r\nShe resolved to use her nevertheless--to use her as far as she could be\r\nserviceable; and she forgot not that she herself had been art and part\r\nin the scheme that had failed. She was not one to shelter herself from\r\nblame by casting the whole storm of disappointment upon another. She\r\ntook her own full share. \"If she was a fool so to advise,\" said Mrs.\r\nHazleton, \"'twas a greater fool to follow her advice.\"\r\n\r\nShe then turned to seek for the agent. No name presented itself but that\r\nof Shanks, the attorney; and she smiled bitterly when she thought of\r\nhim. She recollected that Sir Philip Hastings had thrown him\r\nhead-foremost down the steps of the terrace, and that was very\r\nsatisfactory to her; for, although Mr. Shanks was a man who sometimes\r\nbore injuries very meekly, he never forgot them.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she had somewhat a difficult part to play, for most agents\r\nhave a desire of becoming confidants also, and that Mrs. Hazleton\r\ndetermined her attorney should not be. The task was to insinuate her\r\npurposes rather than to speak them--to act, without betraying the\r\nmotive of action--to make another act, without committing herself by\r\ngiving directions.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Mrs. Hazleton arranged it all to her own satisfaction; and\r\nas she did so, amongst the apparently extinct ashes of former schemes,\r\none small spark of hope began to glow, giving promise for the time to\r\ncome. What did she propose? At first, nothing more than to drive Sir\r\nPhilip Hastings and his family from the country, mingling the\r\ngratification of personal hatred with efforts for the accomplishment of\r\nher own purposes. It was a bold attempt, but Mrs. Hazleton had her plan;\r\nand she sat down and wrote for Mr. Shanks, the attorney.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nDecorum came in with the house of Hanover. I know not whether men and\r\nwomen in England were more virtuous before--I think not--but they\r\ncertainly were more frank in both their virtues and their vices. There\r\nwere fewer of those vices of conventionality thrown around the human\r\nheart--fewer I mean to say of those cold restraints, those gilded chains\r\nof society, which, like the ornaments that ladies wear upon their necks\r\nand arms, seem like fetters; but, I fear me, restrain but little human\r\naction, curb not passion, and are to the strong will but as the green\r\nrushes round the limbs of the Hebrew giant. Decorum came into England\r\nwith the house of Hanover; but I am speaking of a period before that,\r\nwhen ladies were less fearful of the tongue of scandal, when scandal\r\nitself was fearful of assailing virtue, when honesty of purpose and\r\npurity of heart could walk free in the broad day, and men did not\r\nventure to suppose evil acts perpetrated whenever, by a possibility,\r\nthey could be committed.\r\n\r\nEmily Hastings walked quietly along by the side of Mr. Marlow, through\r\nher father's park. There was no one with him, no keen matron's ear to\r\nlisten to and weigh their words, no brother to pretend to accompany\r\nthem, and either feel himself weary with the task or lighten it by\r\nseeking his own amusement apart. They were alone together, and they\r\ntalked without restraint. Ye gods, how they did talk! The dear girl was\r\nin one of her brightest, gayest moods. There was nothing that did not\r\nmove her fancy or become a servant to it. The clouds as they shot across\r\nthe sky, the blue fixed hills in the distance, the red and yellow and\r\ngreen coloring of the young budding oaks, the dancing of The stream, the\r\nsong of the bird, the whisper of the wind, the misty spring light which\r\nspread over the morning distance, all had illustrations for her\r\nthoughts. It seemed that day as if she could not speak without a\r\nfigure--as if she revelled in the flowers of imagination, like a child\r\ntossing about the new mown grass in a hay-field. And he, with joyous\r\nsport, took pleasure in furnishing her at every moment with new material\r\nfor the bounding play of fancy.\r\n\r\nThey had not known each other long; but there was something in the young\r\nman's manner--nay, let me go farther--in his character, which invited\r\nconfidence, which besought the hearts around to throw off all strange\r\ndisguise, and promised that he would take no base advantage of their\r\nopenness. That something was perhaps his earnestness: one felt that he\r\nwas true in all he said or did or looked: that his words were but his\r\nspoken feelings: his countenance a paper on which the heart at once\r\nrecorded its sensations. But let me not be mistaken. Do not let it be\r\nsupposed that when I say he was earnest, I mean that he was even grave.\r\nOh no! Earnestness can exist as well in the merriest as in the soberest\r\nheart. One can be as earnest, as truthful, even as eager in joy or\r\nsport, as in sorrow or sternness. But he was earnest in all things, and\r\nit was this earnestness which probably found a way for him to so many\r\ndissimilar hearts.\r\n\r\nEmily knew not at all what it was doing with hers; but she felt that he\r\nwas one before whom she had no need to hide a thought: that if she were\r\ngay, she might be gay in safety: that if she were inclined to muse, she\r\nmight muse on in peace.\r\n\r\nOnward they walked, talking of every thing on earth but love. It was in\r\nthe thoughts of neither. Emily knew nothing about it: the tranquil\r\nexpanse of life had never for her been even rippled by the wing of\r\npassion. Marlow might know more; but for the time he was lost in the\r\nenjoyment of the moment. The little enemy might be carrying on the war\r\nagainst the fortress of each unconscious bosom; but if so, it was by the\r\nsilent sap and mine, more potent far than the fierce assault or\r\nthundering cannonade--at least in this sort of warfare.\r\n\r\nThey were wending their way towards a gate, at the very extreme limit of\r\nthe park, which opened upon a path leading by a much shorter way to Mr.\r\nMarlow's own dwelling than the road he usually pursued. He had that\r\nmorning come to spend but an hour at the house of Sir Philip Hastings,\r\nand he had an engagement at his own house at noon. He had spent two\r\nhours instead of one with Emily and her mother, and therefore short\r\npaths were preferable to long ones for his purpose, Emily had offered to\r\nshow him the way to the gate, and her company was sure to shorten the\r\nroad, though it might lengthen the time it took to travel.\r\n\r\nNow in describing the park of Sir Philip Hastings, I have said that\r\nthere was a wide open space around the mansion; but I have also said,\r\nthat at some distance the trees gathered thick and sombre. Those nearest\r\nthe house gathered together in clumps, confusing the eye in a wilderness\r\nof hawthorns, and bushes, and evergreen oaks, while beyond appeared a\r\ndense mass of wood; and, through the scattered tufts of trees and thick\r\nwoodland at the extreme of the park ran several paths traced by deer,\r\nand park-keepers, and country folk. Thus for various reasons some\r\nguidance was needful to Marlow on his way, and for more reasons still he\r\nwas well pleased that the guide should be Emily Hastings. In the course\r\nof their walk, amongst many other subjects they spoke of Mrs. Hazleton,\r\nand Marlow expatiated warmly on her beauty, and grace, and kindness of\r\nheart. How different was the effect of all this upon Emily Hastings from\r\nthat which his words in her praise had produced upon her of whom he\r\nspoke! Emily's heart was free. Emily had no schemes, no plans, no\r\npurposes. She knew not that there was one feeling in her bosom with\r\nwhich praise of Mrs. Hazleton could ever jar. She loved her well. Such\r\neyes as hers are not practised in seeing into darkness. She had divined\r\nthe Italian singer--perhaps by instinct, perhaps by some distinct trait,\r\nwhich occasionally will betray the most wily. But Mrs. Hazleton was a\r\nfellow-woman--a woman of great brightness and many fine qualities.\r\nNeither had she any superficial defects to indicate a baser metal or a\r\nharder within. If she was not all gold, she was doubly gilt.\r\n\r\nEmily praised her too, warmed with the theme; and eagerly exclaimed,\r\n\"She always seems to me like one of those dames of fairy tales, upon\r\nwhom some enchanter has bestowed a charm that no one can resist. It is\r\nnot her beauty; for I feel the same when I hear her voice and shut my\r\neyes. It is not her conversation; for I feel the same when I look at her\r\nand she is silent. It seems to breathe from her presence like the odor\r\nof a flower. It is the same when she is grave as when she is gay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, and when she is melancholy,\" replied Marlow. \"I never felt it more\r\npowerfully than a few days ago when I spent an hour with her, and she\r\nwas not only grave but sad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Melancholy!\" exclaimed Emily. \"I never saw her so. Grave I have seen\r\nher--thoughtful, silent--but never sad; and I do not know that she has\r\nnot seemed more charming to me in those grave, stiller moods, than in\r\nmore cheerful ones. Do you know that in looking at the beautiful statues\r\nwhich I have seen in London, I have often thought they might lose half\r\ntheir charm if they would move and speak? Thus, too, with Mrs. Hazleton;\r\nshe seems to me even more lovely, more full of grace, in perfect\r\nstillness than at any other time. My father,\" she added, after a\r\nmoment's pause, \"is the only one who in her presence seems spell-proof.\"\r\n\r\nHer words threw Marlow into a momentary fit of thought. \"Why,\" he asked\r\nhimself, \"was Sir Philip Hastings spell-proof when all others were\r\ncharmed?\"\r\n\r\nMen have a habit of depending much upon men's judgment, whether justly\r\nor unjustly I will not stop to inquire. They rely less upon woman's\r\njudgment in such matters; and yet women are amongst the keenest\r\ndiscerners--when they are unbiassed by passion. But are they often so?\r\nPerhaps it is from a conviction that men judge less frequently from\r\nimpulse, decide more generally from cause, that this presumption of\r\ntheir accuracy exists. Woman--perhaps from seclusion, perhaps from\r\nnature--is more a creature of instincts than man. They are given her for\r\ndefence where reason would act too slowly; and where they do act\r\nstrongly, they are almost invariably right. Man goes through the slower\r\nprocess, and naturally relies more firmly on the result; for reason\r\ndemonstrates where instinct leads blindfold. Marlow judged Sir Philip\r\nHastings by himself, and fancied that he must have some cause for being\r\nspell-proof against the fascinations of Mrs. Hazleton. This roused the\r\nfirst doubt in his mind as to her being all that she seemed. He repelled\r\nthe doubt as injurious, but it returned from time to time in after days,\r\nand at length gave him a clue to an intricate labyrinth.\r\n\r\nThe walk came to an end, too soon he thought. Emily pointed out the gate\r\nas soon as it appeared in sight, shook hands with him and returned\r\nhomeward. He thought more of her after they had parted, than when she\r\nwas with him. There are times when the most thoughtful do not\r\nthink--when they enjoy. But now, every word, every look of her who had\r\njust left him, came back to memory. Not that he would admit to himself\r\nthat there was the least touch of love in his feelings. Oh no! He had\r\nknown her too short a time for such a serious passion as love to have\r\nany thing to do with his sensations. He only thought of\r\nher--mused--pondered--recalled all she had said and done, because she\r\nwas so unlike any thing he had seen or heard of before--a something\r\nnew--a something to be studied.\r\n\r\nShe was but a girl--a mere child, he said; and yet there was something\r\nmore than childish grace in that light, but rounded form, where beauty\r\nwas more than budding, but not quite blossomed, like a moss-rose in its\r\nloveliest state of loveliness. And her mind too; there was nothing\r\nchildish in her thoughts except their playfulness. The morning dew-drops\r\nhad not yet exhaled; but the day-star of the mind was well up in the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nShe was one of those, on whom it is dangerous for a man afraid of love\r\nto meditate too long. She was one the effect of whose looks and words is\r\nnot evanescent. That of mere beauty passes away. How many a face do we\r\nsee and think it the loveliest in the world; yet shut the eyes an hour\r\nafter, and try to recall the features--to paint them to the mind's eye.\r\nYou cannot. But there are others that link themselves with every feeling\r\nof the heart, that twine themselves with constantly recurring thoughts,\r\nthat never can be effaced--never forgotten--on which age or time,\r\ndisease or death, may do its work without effecting one change in the\r\nreality embalmed in memory. Destroy the die, break the mould, you may;\r\nbut the medal and the cast remain. Had Marlow lived a hundred years--had\r\nhe never seen Emily Hastings again, not one line of her bright face, not\r\none speaking look, would have passed from his memory. He could have\r\npainted a portrait of her had he been an artist. Did you ever gaze long\r\nat the sun, trying your eyes against the eagle's? If so, you have had\r\nthe bright orb floating before your eyes the whole day after. And so it\r\nwas with Marlow: throughout the long hours that followed, he had Emily\r\nHastings ever before him. But yet he did not love her. Oh dear no, not\r\nin the least. Love he thought was very different from mere admiration.\r\nIt was a plant of slower growth. He was no believer in love at first\r\nsight. He was an infidel as to Romeo and Juliet, and he had firmly\r\nresolved if ever he did fall in love, it should be done cautiously.\r\n\r\nPoor man! he little knew how deep he was in already.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Emily walked onward. She was heart-whole at least. She\r\nhad never dreamed of love. It had not been one of her studies. Her\r\nfather had never presented the idea to her. Her mother had often talked\r\nof marriage, and marriages good and bad; but always put them in the\r\nlight of alliances--compacts--negotiated treaties. Although Lady\r\nHastings knew what love is as well as any one, and had felt it as\r\ndeeply, yet she did not wish her daughter to be as romantic as she had\r\nbeen, and therefore the subject was avoided. Emily thought a good deal\r\nof Mr. Marlow, it is true. She thought him handsome, graceful,\r\nwinning--one of the pleasantest companions she had ever known. She liked\r\nhim better than any one she had ever seen; and his words rang in her\r\nears long after they were spoken. But even imagination, wicked spinner\r\nof golden threads as she is, never drew one link between his fate and\r\nhers. The time had not yet come, if it was to come.\r\n\r\nShe walked on, however, through the wood; and just when she was emerging\r\nfrom the thicker part into the clumps and scattered trees, she saw a\r\nstranger before her, leaning against the stump of an old hawthorn, and\r\nseeming to suffer pain. He was young, handsome, well-dressed, and there\r\nwas a gun lying at his feet. But as Emily drew nearer, she saw blood\r\nslowly trickling from his arm, and falling on the gray sand of the path.\r\n\r\nShe was not one to suffer shyness to curb humanity; and she exclaimed at\r\nonce, with a look of alarm, \"I am afraid you are hurt, sir. Had you not\r\nbetter come up to the house?\"\r\n\r\nThe young man looked at her, fainted, and answered in a low tone, \"The\r\ngun has gone off, caught by a branch, and has shattered my arm. I\r\nthought I could reach the cottage by the park gates, but I feel faint.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay, stay a moment,\" cried Emily, \"I will run to the hall and bring\r\nassistance--people to assist you upon a carriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" answered the stranger quickly, \"I cannot go there--I will not\r\ngo there! The cottage is nearer,\" he continued more calmly; \"I think\r\nwith a little help I could reach it, if I could staunch the blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me try,\" exclaimed Emily; and with ready zeal, she tied her\r\nhandkerchief round his arm, not without a shaking hand indeed, but with\r\nfirmness and some skill.\r\n\r\n\"Now lean upon me,\" she said, when she had done; \"the cottage is indeed\r\nnearer, but you would have better tendance if you could reach the hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, the cottage,\" replied the stranger, \"I shall do well there.\"\r\n\r\nThe cottage was perhaps two hundred yards nearer to the spot on which\r\nthey stood than the hall; but there was an eagerness about the young\r\nman's refusal to go to the latter, which Emily remarked. Suspicion\r\nindeed was alive to her mind; but those were days when laws concerning\r\ngame, which have every year been becoming less and less strict, were\r\nhardly less severe than in the time of William Rufus. Every day, in the\r\ncountry life which she led, she heard some tale of poaching or its\r\npunishment. The stranger had a gun with him; she had found him in her\r\nfather's park; he was unwilling even in suffering and need of help to go\r\nup to the hall for succor; and she could not but fancy that for some\r\nfrolic, perhaps some jest, or some wild whim, he had been trespassing\r\nupon the manor in pursuit of game. That he was an ordinary poacher she\r\ncould not suppose; his dress, his appearance forbade such a supposition.\r\n\r\nBut there was something more.\r\n\r\nIn the young man's face--more in its expression than its features\r\nperhaps--more in certain marking lines and sudden glances than in the\r\ngeneral whole--there was something familiar to her--something that\r\nseemed akin to her. He was handsomer than her father; of a more perfect\r\nthough less lofty character of beauty; and yet there was a strange\r\nlikeness, not constant, but flashing occasionally upon her brow, in\r\nwhat, when, she could hardly determine.\r\n\r\nIt roused another sort of sympathy from any she had felt before; and\r\nonce more she asked him to go up to the hall.\r\n\r\n\"If you have been taking your sport,\" she said, \"where perhaps you ought\r\nnot, I am sure my father will look over it without a word, when he sees\r\nhow you are hurt. Although people sometimes think he is stern and\r\nsevere, that is all a mistake. He is kind and gentle, I assure you, when\r\nhe does not feel that duty requires him to be rigid.\"\r\n\r\nThe stranger gave a quick start, and replied in a tone which would have\r\nbeen haughty and fierce, had not weakness subdued it, \"I have been\r\nshooting only where I have a right to shoot. But I will not go up to the\r\nhall, till--but I dare say I can get down to the cottage without help,\r\nMistress Emily. I have been accustomed to do without help in the world;\"\r\nand he withdrew his arm from that which supported him. The next moment,\r\nhowever, he tottered, and seemed ready to fall, and Emily again hurried\r\nto help him. There were no more words spoken. She thought his manner\r\nsomewhat uncivil; she would not leave him, and the necessity for her\r\nkindness was soon apparent. Ere they were within a hundred yards of the\r\ncottage, he sunk slowly down. His face grew pale and death-like, and his\r\neyes closed faintly as he lay upon the turf. Emily ran on like lightning\r\nto the cottage, and called out the old man who lived there. The old man\r\ncalled his son from the little garden, and with his and other help,\r\ncarried the fainting man in.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, master John, master John,\" exclaimed the old cottager, as he laid\r\nhim in his own bed; \"one of your wild pranks, I warrant!\"\r\n\r\nHis wife, his son, and he himself tended the young man with care; and a\r\nyoung boy was sent off for a surgeon.\r\n\r\nEmily did not know what to do; but compassion kept her in the cottage\r\ntill the stranger recovered his consciousness, and then after inquiring\r\nhow he felt, she was about to withdraw, intending to send down further\r\naid from the hall. But the stranger beckoned her faintly to come nearer,\r\nand said in tones of real gratitude, \"Thank you a thousand times,\r\nMistress Emily; I never thought to need such kindness at your hands. But\r\nnow do me another, and say not a word to any one at the mansion of what\r\nhas happened. It will be better for me, for you, for your father, that\r\nyou should not speak of this business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not! do not! Mistress Emily!\" cried the old man, who was standing\r\nnear. \"It will only make mischief and bring about evil.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke evidently under strong apprehension, and Emily was much\r\nsurprised, both to find that one quite a stranger to her knew her at\r\nonce, and to find the old cottager, a long dependant upon her family,\r\nsecond so eagerly his strange injunction.\r\n\r\n\"I will say nothing unless questions are asked me,\" she replied; \"then\r\nof course I must tell the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better not,\" replied the young man gloomily.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot speak falsely,\" replied the beautiful girl, \"I cannot deal\r\ndoubly with my parents or any one,\" and she was turning away.\r\n\r\nBut the stranger besought her to stop one moment, and said, \"I have not\r\nstrength to explain all now; but I shall see you again, and then I will\r\ntell you why I have spoken as you think strangely. I shall see you\r\nagain. In common charity you will come to ask if I am alive or dead. If\r\nyou knew how near we are to each other, I am sure you would promise!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can make no such promise,\" replied Emily; but the old cottager seemed\r\neager to end the interview; and speaking for her, he exclaimed, \"Oh, she\r\nwill come, I am sure, Mistress Emily will come;\" and hurried her away,\r\nseeing her back to the little gate in the park wall.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton found Mr. Shanks, the attorney, the most difficult person\r\nto deal with whom she had ever met in her life. She had remarked that he\r\nwas keen, active, intelligent, unscrupulous, confident in his own\r\npowers, bold as a lion in the wars of quill, parchment, and red tape;\r\nwithout fear, without hesitation, without remorse. There was nothing\r\nthat he scrupled to do, nothing that he ever repented having done. She\r\nhad fancied that the only difficulty which she could have to encounter\r\nwas that of concealing from him, at least in a degree, the ultimate\r\nobjects and designs which she herself had in view.\r\n\r\nSo shrewd people often deceive themselves as to the character of other\r\nshrewd people. The difficulty was quite different. It was a peculiar\r\nsort of stolidity on the part of Mr. Shanks, for which she was utterly\r\nunprepared.\r\n\r\nNow the attorney was ready to do any thing on earth which his fair\r\npatroness wished. He would have perilled his name on the roll in her\r\nservice; and was only eager to understand what were her desires, even\r\nwithout giving her the trouble of explaining them. Moreover, there was\r\nno point of law or equity, no manner of roguery or chicanery, no object\r\nof avarice, covetousness, or ambition, which he could not have\r\ncomprehended at once. They were things within his own ken and scope, to\r\nwhich the intellect and resources of his mind were always open. But to\r\nother passions, to deeper, more remote motives and emotions, Mr. Shanks\r\nwas as stolid as a door-post. It required to hew a way as it were to his\r\nperceptions, to tunnel his mind for the passage of a new conception.\r\n\r\nThe only passion which afforded the slightest cranny of an opening was\r\nrevenge; and after having tried a dozen other ways of making him\r\ncomprehend what she wished without committing herself, Mrs. Hazleton got\r\nhim to understand that she thought Sir Philip Hastings had injured--at\r\nall events, that he had offended--her, and that she sought vengeance.\r\nFrom that moment all was easy. Mr. Shanks could understand the feeling,\r\nthough not its extent. He would himself have given ten pounds out of his\r\nown pocket--the largest sum he had ever given in life for any thing but\r\nan advantage--to be revenged upon the same man for the insult he had\r\nreceived; and he could perceive that Mrs. Hazleton would go much\r\nfurther, without, indeed, being able to conceive, or even dream of, the\r\nextent to which she was prepared to go.\r\n\r\nHowever, when he had once got the clue, he was prepared to run along the\r\nroad with all celerity; and now she found him every thing she had\r\nexpected. He was a man copious in resources, prolific of schemes. His\r\nimagination had exercised itself through life in devising crooked paths;\r\nbut in this instance the road was straight-forward before him. He would\r\nrather it had been tortuous, it is true; but for the sake of his dear\r\nlady he was ready to follow even a plain path, and he explained to her\r\nthat Sir Philip Hastings stood in a somewhat dangerous position.\r\n\r\nHe was proceeding to enter into the details, but Mrs. Hazleton\r\ninterrupted him, and, to his surprise, not only told him, but showed\r\nhim, that she knew all the particulars.\r\n\r\n\"The only question is, Mr. Shanks,\" she said, \"can you prove the\r\nmarriage of his elder brother to this woman before the birth of the\r\nchild?\"\r\n\r\n\"We think we can, madam,\" replied the attorney, \"we think we can. There\r\nis a very strong letter, and there has been evidently----\"\r\n\r\nHe paused and hesitated, and Mrs. Hazleton demanded, \"There has been\r\nwhat, Mr. Shanks?\"\r\n\r\n\"There has been evidently a leaf torn out of the register,\" replied the\r\nlawyer.\r\n\r\nThere was something in his manner which made the lady gaze keenly in his\r\nface; but she would ask no questions on that subject, and she merely\r\nsaid, \"Then why has not the case gone on, as it was put in your hands\r\nsix months ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you see, my dear madam,\" replied Shanks, \"law is at best\r\nuncertain. One wants two or three great lawyers to make a case. Money\r\nwas short; John and his mother had spent all last year's annuity.\r\nBarristers won't plead without fees, and besides----\"\r\n\r\nHe paused again, but an impatient gesture from the lady urged him on.\r\n\"Besides,\" he said, \"I had devised a little scheme, which, of course, I\r\nshall abandon now, for marrying him to Mistress Emily Hastings. He is a\r\nvery handsome young fellow, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"I have seen him,\" said Mrs. Hazleton thoughtfully, \"but why should you\r\nabandon this scheme, Mr. Shanks? It seems to me by no means a bad one.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor lawyer was now all at sea again and fancied himself as wide of\r\nthe lady's aim as ever.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton suffered him to remain in this dull suspense for some\r\ntime. Wrapped up in her own thoughts, and busy with her own\r\ncalculations, she suffered several minutes to elapse without adding a\r\nword to that which had so much surprised the attorney. Then, however,\r\nshe said, in a meditative tone, \"There is only one way by which it can\r\nbe accomplished. If you allow it to be conducted in a formal manner, you\r\nwill fail utterly. Sir Philip will never consent. She will never even\r\nyield.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if Sir Philip is made to see that it will save him a tremendous\r\nlawsuit, and perhaps his whole estate,\" suggested Mr. Shanks.\r\n\r\n\"He will resist the more firmly,\" answered the lady; \"if it saved his\r\nlife, he would reject it with scorn--no! But there is a way. If you can\r\npersuade her--if you can show her that her father's safety, his position\r\nin life, depends upon her conduct, perhaps you may bring her by degrees\r\nto consent to a private marriage. She is young, inexperienced,\r\nenthusiastic, romantic. She loves her father devotedly, and would make\r\nany sacrifice for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No great sacrifice, I should think, madam,\" replied Mr. Shanks, \"to\r\nmarry a handsome young man who has a just claim to a large fortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is as people may judge,\" replied the lady; \"but at all events this\r\nclaim gives us a hold upon her which we must not fail to use, and that\r\ndirectly. I will contrive means of bringing them together. I will make\r\nopportunity for the lad, but you must instruct him how to use it\r\nproperly. All I can do is to co-operate without appearing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear madam, I really do not fully understand,\" said Mr. Shanks.\r\n\"I had a fancy--a sort of imagination like, that you wished--that you\r\ndesired----\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated; but Mrs. Hazleton would not help him by a single word, and\r\nat last he added, \"I had a fancy that you wished this suit to go on\r\nagainst Sir Philip Hastings, and now--but that does not matter--only do\r\nyou really wish to bring it all to an end, to settle it by a marriage\r\nbetween John and Mistress Emily?'\r\n\r\n\"That will be the pleasantest, the easiest way of settling it, sir,\"\r\nreplied Mrs. Hazleton, coolly; \"and I do not at all desire to injure,\r\nbut rather to serve Sir Philip and his family.\"\r\n\r\nThat was false, for though to marry Emily Hastings to any one but Mr.\r\nMarlow was what the lady did very sincerely desire; yet there was a long\r\naccount to be settled with Sir Philip Hastings which could not well be\r\ndischarged without a certain amount of injury to him and his. The lady\r\nwas well aware, too, that she had told a lie, and moreover that it was\r\none which Mr. Shanks was not at all likely to believe. Perhaps even she\r\ndid not quite wish him to believe it, and at all events she knew that\r\nher actions must soon give it contradiction. But men make strange\r\ndistinctions between speech and action, not to be accounted for without\r\nlong investigation and disquisition. There are cases where people shrink\r\nfrom defining in words their purposes, or giving voice to their\r\nfeelings, even when they are prepared by acts to stamp them for\r\neternity. There are cases where men do acts which they dare not cover by\r\na lie.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton sought for no less than the ruin of Sir Philip Hastings;\r\nshe had determined it in her own heart, and yet she would not own it to\r\nher agent--perhaps she would not own it to herself. There is a dark\r\nsecret chamber in the breast of every one, at the door of which the eyes\r\nof the spirit are blindfolded, that it may not see the things to which\r\nit is consenting. Conscience records them silently, and sooner or later\r\nher book is to be opened; it may be in this world: it may be in the\r\nnext: but for the time that book is in the keeping of passion, who\r\nrarely suffers the pages to be seen till purpose has been ratified by\r\nact, and remorse stands ready to pronounce the doom.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause after Mrs. Hazleton had spoken, for the attorney was\r\nbusy also with thoughts he wished to utter, yet dared not speak. The\r\nfirst prospect of a lawsuit--the only sort of the picturesque in which\r\nhe could find pleasure--a long, intricate, expensive lawsuit, was fading\r\nbefore his eyes as if a mist were coming over the scene. Where were his\r\nconsultations, his letters, his briefs, his pleas, his rejoinders, his\r\ndemurrers, his appeals? Where were the fees, the bright golden fees?\r\nTrue, in the hopelessness of his young client's fortunes, he had urged\r\nthe marriage with a proviso, that if it took place by his skilful\r\nmanagement, a handsome bonus was to be his share of the spoil. But then\r\nMrs. Hazleton's first communication had raised brighter hopes, had put\r\nhim more in his own element, had opened to him a scene of achievements\r\nas glorious to his notions as those of the listed field to knights of\r\nold; and now all was vanishing away. Yet he did not venture to tell her\r\nhow much he was disappointed, still less to show her why and how.\r\n\r\nIt was the lady who spoke first; and she did so in as calm, deliberate,\r\npassionless a tone as if she had been devising the fashion of a new\r\nMantua.\r\n\r\n\"It may be as well, Mr. Shanks,\" she said, \"in order to produce the\r\neffect we wish upon dear Emily's mind\"--dear Emily!--\"to commence the\r\nsuit against Sir Philip--I mean to take those first steps which may\r\ncreate some alarm. I cannot of course judge what they ought to be, but\r\nyou must know; and if not, you must seek advice from counsel learned in\r\nthe law. You understand what I mean, doubtless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, certainly, madam, certainly,\" replied Mr. Shanks, with a profound\r\nsigh of relief. \"First steps commit us to nothing: but they must be\r\ndevised cautiously, and I am very much afraid that--that----\"\r\n\r\n\"Afraid of what, sir?\" asked Mrs. Hazleton, in a tone somewhat stern.\r\n\r\n\"Only that the expense will be greater than my young client can afford,\"\r\nanswered the lawyer, seeing that he must come to the point.\r\n\r\n\"Let not that stand in the way,\" said Mrs. Hazleton at once; \"I will\r\nsupply the means. What will be the expense?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you object to say five hundred pounds?\" asked the lawyer,\r\ncautiously.\r\n\r\n\"A thousand,\" replied the lady, with a slight inclination of the head;\r\nand then, weary of circumlocution, she added in a bolder tone than she\r\nhad yet used, \"only remember, sir, that what is done must be done\r\neffectually; no mistakes, no errors, no flaws! See that you use all your\r\neyes--see that you bend every nerve to the task. I will have no\r\nprocrastination for the sake of fresh fees--nothing omitted one day to\r\nbe remembered the next--no blunders to be corrected after long delays\r\nand longer correspondence. I know you lawyers and your ways right well;\r\nand if I find that for the sake of swelling a bill to the bursting, you\r\nattempt to procrastinate, the cause will be taken at once from your\r\nhands and placed in those who will do their work more speedily. You can\r\npractise those tricks upon those who are more or less in your power; but\r\nyou shall not play them upon me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I declare, my dear madam, I can assure you,\" said Mr. Shanks; but Mrs.\r\nHazleton cut him short. \"There, there,\" she said, waving her fair hand,\r\n\"do not declare--do not assure me of any thing. Let your actions speak,\r\nMr. Shanks. I am too much accustomed to declarations and assurances to\r\nset much value upon them. Now tell me, but in as few words and with as\r\nfew cant terms as possible, what are the chances of success in this\r\nsuit? How does the young man's case really stand?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Shanks would gladly have been excused such explanations. He never\r\nliked to speak clearly upon such delicate questions, but he would not\r\nventure to refuse any demand of Mrs. Hazleton's, and therefore he began\r\nwith a circumlocution in regard to the uncertainty of law, and to the\r\nimpossibility of giving any exact assurances of success.\r\n\r\nThe lady would not be driven from her point, however. \"That is not what\r\nI sought to know,\" she said. \"I am as well aware of the law's\r\nuncertainty--of its iniquity, as you. But I ask you what grounds you\r\nhave to go upon? Were they ever really married? Is this son legitimate?\"\r\n\r\n\"The lady says they were married,\" replied Mr. Shanks cautiously, \"and I\r\nhave good hope we can prove the legitimacy. There is a letter in which\r\nthe late Mr. John Hastings calls her 'my dear little wife;' and then\r\nthere is clearly a leaf torn out of the marriage register about that\r\nvery time.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Shanks spoke the last words slowly and with some hesitation; but\r\nafter a pause he went on more boldly and rapidly. \"Then we have a\r\ndeposition of the old woman Danby that they were married. This is clear\r\nand precise,\" he continued with a grin: \"she wanted to put in something\r\nabout 'in the eyes of God,' but I left that out as beside the question;\r\nand she did the swearing very well. She might have broken down under\r\ncross-examination, it is true; and therefore it was well to put off the\r\ntrial till she was gone. We can prove, moreover, that the late Sir John\r\nalways paid an annuity to both mother and child, in order to make them\r\nkeep secret--nay more, that he bribed the old woman Danby. This is our\r\nstrong point; but it is beyond doubt--I can prove it, madam--I can prove\r\nit. All I fear is the mother; she is weak--very weak; I wish to heaven\r\nshe were out of the way till the trial is over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Send her out of the way,\" cried Mrs. Hazleton, decidedly; \"send her to\r\nFrance;\" and then she added, with a bitter smile, \"she may still figure\r\namongst the beauties of Versailles.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she will not go,\" replied Mr. Shanks. \"Madam, she will not go. I\r\nhinted at such a step--mentioned Cornwall or Ireland--any where she\r\ncould be concealed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cornwall or Ireland!\" exclaimed Mrs. Hazleton, \"of course she would not\r\ngo. Why did not you propose Africa or the plantations? She shall go, Mr.\r\nShanks. Leave her to me. She shall go. And now, set to work at\r\nonce--immediately, I say--this very day. Send the youth to-morrow, and\r\nlet him bring me word that some step is taken. I will instruct him how\r\nto act, while you deal with the law.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Shanks promised to obey, and retired overawed by all he had seen and\r\nheard. There had, it is true, been no vehement demonstration of passion;\r\nno fierce blaze; no violent flash; but there had been indications enough\r\nto show the man of law all that was raging within. It had been for him\r\nlike gazing at a fine building on fire at that period of the\r\nconflagration where dense smoke and heavy darkness brood over the\r\nfearful scene, while dull, suddenly-smothered flashes break across the\r\ngloom, and tell how terrible will be the flame when it does burst freely\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nHe had never known Mrs. Hazleton before--he had never comprehended her\r\nfully. But now he knew her--now, though perhaps the depths were still\r\nunfathomable to his eyes, he felt that there was a strong commanding\r\nwill within that beautiful form which would bear no trifling. He had\r\noften treated her with easy lightness--with no want of apparent respect\r\nindeed--but with the persuasions and arguments such as men of business\r\noften address to women as beings inferior to themselves either in\r\nintellect or experience. Now Mr. Shanks wondered how he had escaped so\r\nlong and so well, and he resolved that for the future his conduct should\r\nbe very different.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton, when he left her, sat down to rest--yes, to rest; for she\r\nwas very weary. There had been the fatiguing strife of strong passions\r\nin the heart--hopes--expectations--schemes-contrivances; and, above all,\r\nthere had been a wrestling with herself to deal calmly and softly where\r\nshe felt fiercely. It had exhausted her; and for some minutes she sat\r\nlistlessly, with her eyes half shut, like one utterly tired out. Ere a\r\nquarter of an hour had passed, wheels rolled up to the door; a\r\ncarriage-step was let down, and there was a foot-fall in the hall.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Mrs. Warmington, delighted to see you!\" said Mrs. Hazleton, with a\r\nsmile sweet and gentle as the dawn of a summer morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nCircumstance will always have its finger in the pie with the best-laid\r\nschemes; but it does not always happen that thereby the pie is spoiled.\r\nOn the contrary, circumstance is sometimes a very powerful auxiliary,\r\nand it happened so in the present instance with the arrangements of Mrs.\r\nHazleton. Before that lady could bring any part of her scheme for\r\nintroducing Emily to the man whom she intended to drive her into taking\r\nas a husband, to bear, the introduction had already taken place, as we\r\nhave seen, by an accident.\r\n\r\nIt was likely, indeed, to go no further; for Emily thought over what had\r\noccurred, before she gave way to her native kindness of heart. She\r\nremembered how tenacious all country gentlemen of that day were of their\r\nsporting rights, and especially of what she had often heard her father\r\ndeclare, that he looked upon any body who took his game off his\r\nproperty, according to every principle of equity and justice, as no\r\nbetter than a common robber.\r\n\r\n\"If the only excuse be that it is more exposed to depredation than other\r\nproperty,\" said Sir Philip, \"it only shows that the plunderer of it is a\r\ncoward as well as a villain, and should be punished the more severely.\"\r\nSuch, and many such speeches she had heard from her father at various\r\ntimes, and it became a case of conscience, which puzzled the poor girl\r\nmuch, whether she ought or ought not to have promised not to mention\r\nwhat had occurred in the park. She loved no concealment, and nothing\r\nwould have induced her to tell a falsehood; but she knew that if she\r\nmentioned the facts, especially while the young man whom she had seen\r\ncrossing the park with a gun lay wounded at the cottage, great evil\r\nmight have resulted; and though she somewhat reproached herself for\r\nrashly giving her word, she would not break it when given.\r\n\r\nAs to seeing him again, however--as to visiting him at the cottage, even\r\nto inquire after his health, when he had refused all aid from her\r\nfather's house, that was an act she never dreamed of. His last words,\r\nindeed, had puzzled her; and there was something in his face, too, which\r\nset her fancy wandering. It was not exactly what she liked; but yet\r\nthere was a resemblance, she thought, to some one she knew and was\r\nattached to. It could not be to her father, she said to herself, and yet\r\nher father's face recurred to her mind more frequently than any other\r\nwhen she thought of that of the young man she had seen; and from that\r\nfact a sort of prepossession in the youth's favor took possession of\r\nher, making her long to know who he really was.\r\n\r\nFor some days Emily did not go near the cottage, but at length she\r\nventured on the road which passed it--not without a hope, indeed, that\r\nshe might meet one of the old people who tenanted it, and have an\r\nopportunity of inquiring after his health--but certainly not, as some\r\ngood-natured reader may suppose, with any expectation of seeing him\r\nherself. As she approached, however, she perceived him sitting on a\r\nbench at the cottage-door, and, by a natural impulse, she turned at once\r\ninto another path, which led back by a way nearly as short to the hall.\r\nThe young man instantly rose, and followed her, addressing her by name,\r\nin a voice still weak, in truth, but too loud for her not to hear, or to\r\naffect not to hear.\r\n\r\nShe paused, rather provoked than otherwise, and slightly inclined her\r\nhead, while the young man approached, with every appearance of respect,\r\nand thanked her for the assistance she had rendered him.\r\n\r\nHe had had his lesson in the mean time, and he played his part not\r\namiss. All coarse swagger, all vulgar assumption was gone from his\r\nmanner; and referring himself to some words he had spoken when last they\r\nhad met, he said: \"Pardon me, Miss Hastings, for what I said some days\r\nago, which might seem both strange and mysterious, and for pressing to\r\nsee you again; but at that time I was faint with loss of blood, and knew\r\nnot how this might end. I wished to tell you something I thought you\r\nought to hear; but now I am better; and I will find a more fitting\r\nopportunity ere long.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be better to say any thing you think fit to my father,\" replied\r\nEmily. \"I am not accustomed to deal with any matters of importance; and\r\nany thing of so much moment as you seem to think this is, would, of\r\ncourse, be told by me to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" replied the other, with a mysterious smile; \"but of that\r\nyou will judge when you have heard all I have to say. Your father is the\r\nlast person to whom I would mention it myself, because I believe,\r\nnotwithstanding all his ability, he is the last person who would judge\r\nsanely of it, as he would of most other matters; but, of course, you\r\nwill speak of it or not, as you think proper. At present,\" he added, \"I\r\nam too weak to attempt the detail, even if I could venture to detain you\r\nhere. I only wished to return you my best thanks, and assure you of my\r\ngratitude,\" and bowing low, he left her to pursue her way homeward.\r\n\r\nEmily went on musing. No woman's breast is without curiosity--nor any\r\nman's, either--and she asked herself what could be the meaning of the\r\nstranger's words, at least a dozen times. What could he have to tell\r\nher, and why was there so much mystery? She did not like mystery,\r\nhowever; and though she felt interested in the young man--felt _pity_,\r\nin fact--yet it was by no means the interest that leads to, nor the pity\r\nwhich is akin to love. On the contrary, she liked him less than the\r\nfirst time she saw him. There was a certain degree of cunning in his\r\nmysterious smile, a look of self-confidence, almost of triumph in his\r\nface, which, in spite of his respectful demeanor, did not please her.\r\n\r\nEmily's father was absent from home at this time; but he returned two or\r\nthree days after this last interview, and remarked that his daughter was\r\nunusually grave. To her, and to all that affected her in any way, his\r\neyes were always open, though he often failed to comprehend that which\r\nhe observed. Lady Hastings, too, had noticed Emily's unusual gravity,\r\nand as she had no clue to that which made her thoughtful, she concluded\r\nthat the solitude of the country had a depressing influence upon her\r\nspirits, as it frequently had upon her own; and she determined to speak\r\nto her husband upon the matter. To him she represented that the place\r\nwas very dull; that they had but few visitors; that even Mr. Marlow had\r\nnot called for a week; and that Emily really required some variety of\r\nscene and amusement.\r\n\r\nShe reasoned well according to her notions, and though Sir Philip could\r\nnot quite comprehend them, though he abhorred great cities, and loved\r\nthe country, she had made some impression at least by reiteration, when\r\nsuddenly a letter arrived from Mrs. Hazleton, petitioning that Emily\r\nmight be permitted to spend a few days with her.\r\n\r\n\"I am quite alone,\" she said, \"and not very well (she never was better\r\nin her life), and I propose next week to make some excursions to all the\r\nbeautiful and interesting spots in the neighborhood. But you know, dear\r\nLady Hastings, there is but small pleasure in such expeditions when they\r\nmust be solitary; but with such a mind as that of your dear Emily for my\r\ncompanion, every object will possess a double interest.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader has perceived that the letter was addressed to Lady Hastings;\r\nbut it was written for the eye of Sir Philip, and to him it was shown.\r\nLady Hastings observed, as she put the note into her husband's hand,\r\nthat it would be much better to go to London. The change from their own\r\nhouse to Mrs. Hazleton's was not enough to do Emily any good; and that,\r\nas to these expeditions to neighboring places, she had always found them\r\nthe dullest things imaginable.\r\n\r\nSir Philip thought differently, however. He had been brought to the\r\npoint of believing that Emily did want change, but not to the conviction\r\nthat London would afford the best change for her. He inquired of Emily,\r\nhowever, which she would like best, a visit of a week to Mrs.\r\nHazleton's, or a short visit to the metropolis. Much to his\r\nsatisfaction, Emily decided at once in favor of the former, and Mrs.\r\nHazleton's letter was answered, accepting her invitation.\r\n\r\nThe day before Emily went, Mr. Marlow spent nearly two hours with her\r\nand her father in the sort of musy, wandering conversation which is so\r\ndelightful to imaginative minds. He paid Emily herself no marked or\r\nparticular attention; but he never suffered her to doubt that even while\r\ntalking with her father, he was fully conscious of her presence, and\r\npleased with it. Sometimes his conversation was addressed to her\r\ndirectly, and when it was not, by a word or look he would invite her to\r\njoin in, and listened to her words as if they were very sweet to his\r\near.\r\n\r\nShe loved to listen to him, however, better than to speak herself, and\r\nhe contrived to please and interest her in all he said, gently moving\r\nall sorts of various feelings, sometimes making her smile gayly,\r\nsometimes muse thoughtfully, and sometimes rendering her almost sad. If\r\nhe had been the most practiced love-maker in the world, he could not\r\nhave done better with a mind like that of Emily Hastings.\r\n\r\nHe heard of her proposed visit to Mrs. Hazleton with pleasure, and\r\nexpressed it. \"I am very glad to hear you are to be with her,\" he said,\r\n\"for I do not think Mrs. Hazleton is well. She has lost her usual\r\nspirits, and has been very grave and thoughtful when I have seen her\r\nlately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if I can cheer and soothe her,\" cried Emily eagerly, \"how\r\ndelightful my visit will be to me. Mrs. Hazleton says in her letter that\r\nshe is unwell; and that decided me to go to her, rather than to London.\"\r\n\r\n\"To London!\" exclaimed Mr. Marlow, \"I had no idea that you proposed such\r\na journey. Oh, Sir Philip, do not take your daughter to London. Friends\r\nof mine there are often in the habit of bringing in fresh and beautiful\r\nflowers from the country; but I always see that first they become dull\r\nand dingy with the smoke and heavy air, and then wither away and perish;\r\nand often in gay parties, I have thought that I saw in the young and\r\nbeautiful around me the same dulling influence, the same withering, both\r\nof the body and the heart.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hastings smiled pleasantly, and assured his young friend that\r\nhe had no desire or intention of going to the capital except for one\r\nmonth in the winter, and Emily looked up brightly, saying, \"For my part,\r\nI only wish that even then I could be left behind. When last I was\r\nthere, I was so tired of the blue velvet lining of the gilt _vis-a-vis_,\r\nthat I used to try and paint fancy pictures of the country upon it as I\r\ndrove through the streets with mamma.\"\r\n\r\nAt length Emily set out in the heavy family coach, with her maid and Sir\r\nPhilip for her escort. Progression was slow in those days compared with\r\nour own, when a man can get as much event into fifty years as Methuselah\r\ndid into a thousand. The journey took three hours at the least; but it\r\nseemed short to Emily, for at the end of the first hour they were\r\novertaken by Mr. Marlow on horseback, and he rode along with them to the\r\ngate of Mrs. Hazleton's house. He was an admirable horseman, for he had\r\nnot only a good but a graceful seat, and his handsome figure and fine\r\ngentlemanly carriage never appeared to greater advantage than when he\r\ndid his best to be a centaur. The slow progress of the lumbering vehicle\r\nmight have been of some inconvenience, but his horse was trained to\r\ncanter to a walk when he pleased, and, leaning to the window of the\r\ncarriage, and sometimes resting his hand upon it, he contrived to carry\r\non the conversation with those within almost as easily as in a\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\nJust as the carriage was approaching the gate, Marlow said: \"I think I\r\nshall not go in with you, Sir Philip; for I have a little business\r\nfarther on, and I have ridden more slowly than I thought;\" but before\r\nthe sentence was well concluded, the gates of the park were opened by\r\nthe porter, and Mrs. Hazleton herself appeared within, leaning on the\r\narm of her maid. She had calculated well the period of Emily's arrival,\r\nand had gone out to the gate for the purpose of giving her an extremely\r\nhospitable welcome. Probably, had she not hated her as warmly and\r\nsincerely as she did, she would have stayed at home; our attention is\r\never doubtful.\r\n\r\nBut what were Mrs. Hazleton's feelings when she saw Mr. Marlow riding by\r\nthe side of the carriage? I will not attempt to describe them; but for\r\none instant a strange dark cloud passed over her beautiful face. It was\r\nbanished in an instant; but not before Marlow had remarked both the\r\nexpression itself and the sudden glance of the lady's eyes from him to\r\nEmily. For the first time a doubt, a suspicion, a something he did not\r\nlike to fathom, came over his mind; and he resolved to watch. Neither\r\nEmily nor her father perceived that look, and as the next moment the\r\nbeautiful face was once more as bright as ever, they felt pleased with\r\nher kind eagerness to meet them; and alighting from the carriage, walked\r\non with her to the house, while Marlow, dismounted, accompanied them,\r\nleading his horse.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to see you, Mr. Marlow,\" said Mrs. Hazleton, in a tone from\r\nwhich she could not do what she would--banish all bitterness. \"I suppose\r\nI owe the pleasure of your visit to that which you yourself feel in\r\nescorting a fair lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must not, I fear, pretend to such gallantry,\" replied Marlow. \"I\r\novertook the carriage accidentally as I was riding to Mr. Cornelius\r\nBrown's; and to say the truth, I did not intend to come in, for I am\r\nsomewhat late.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cold comfort for my vanity,\" replied the lady, \"that you would not have\r\npaid me a visit unless you had met me at the gate.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke in a tone rather of sadness than of anger; but Marlow did not\r\nchoose to perceive any thing serious in her words, and he replied,\r\nlaughing: \"Nay, dear Mrs. Hazleton, you do not read the riddle aright.\r\nIt shows, when rightly interpreted, that your society is so charming\r\nthat I cannot resist its influence when once within the spell, even for\r\nthe sake of the Englishman's god--Business.\"\r\n\r\n\"A man always succeeds in drawing some flattery for woman's ear out of\r\nthe least flattering conduct,\" answered Mrs. Hazleton.\r\n\r\nThe conversation then took another turn; and after walking with the rest\r\nof the party up to the house, Marlow again mounted and rode away. As\r\nsoon as the horses had obtained some food and repose, Sir Philip also\r\nreturned, and Emily was left, with a woman who felt at her heart that\r\nshe could have poniarded her not an hour before.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Hazleton was all gentle sweetness, and calm, thoughtful,\r\ndignified ease. She did not suffer her attention to be diverted for one\r\nmoment from her fair guest: there were no reveries, no absence of mind;\r\nand Emily--poor Emily--thought her more charming than ever.\r\nNevertheless, while speaking upon many subjects, and brightly and\r\nintelligently upon all, there was an under-current of thought going on\r\nunceasingly in Mrs. Hazleton's mind, different from that upon the\r\nsurface. She was trying to read Marlow's conduct towards Emily--to judge\r\nwhether he loved her or not. She asked herself whether his having\r\nescorted her to that house was in reality purely accidental, and she\r\nwished that she could have seen them together but for a few moments\r\nlonger, though every moment had been a dagger to her heart. Nay, she did\r\nmore: she strove by many a dexterous turn of the conversation, to lure\r\nout her fair unconscious guest's inmost thoughts--to induce her, not to\r\ntell all, for that she knew was hopeless, but to betray all. Emily,\r\nhowever, happily for herself, was unconscious; she knew not that there\r\nwas any thing to betray. Fortunately, most fortunately, she knew not\r\nwhat was in her own breast; or perhaps I should say, knew not what it\r\nmeant. Her answers were all simple, natural and true; and plain candor,\r\nas often happens, disappointed art.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton retired for the night with the conviction that whatever\r\nmight be Marlow's feelings towards Emily, Emily was not in love with\r\nMarlow; and that was something gained.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" she said, with a pride in her own discernment, \"a woman who\r\nknows something of the world can never be long deceived in regard to\r\nanother woman's heart.\" She should have added, \"except by its\r\nsimplicity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" she continued, mentally, \"to-morrow for the first great stop. If\r\nthis youth can but demean himself wisely, and will follow the advice I\r\nhave given him, he has a fair field to act in. He seems prompt and ready\r\nenough: he is assuredly handsome, and what between his good looks, kind\r\npersuasion by others, and her father's dangerous position, this girl\r\nmethinks may be easily driven--or led into his arms; and that\r\nstumbling-block removed. He will punish her enough hereafter, or I am\r\nmistaken.\"\r\n\r\nPunish her for what, Mrs. Hazleton?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[M] Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1850, by G. P. R.\r\nJames, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States\r\nfor the Southern District of New-York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRIENDSHIP OF JOSEPHUS AND ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Princeton Review_, the _Church of England Quarterly_, and other\r\nperiodicals, there have appeared recently several very interesting\r\narticles upon the Voyage of St. Paul to Rome; and in a work entitled\r\n\"Gleanings on the Overland Route,\" by the author of \"Forty Days in the\r\nDesert,\" just published in London, we find a dissertation \"On the\r\nShipwreck of the Apostle Paul, and the historian Josephus,\" which goes\r\nfar to prove that Josephus accompanied the apostle to Rome, and that he\r\nwas in some measure the means of procuring the introduction of the\r\nChristians into \"Caesar's household.\" After a summary account of the\r\nshipwreck as narrated by St. Luke, aided by such elucidatory particulars\r\nas have been supplied by Mr. James Smith in his \"Voyage and Shipwreck of\r\nSt. Paul,\" the author says:--\r\n\r\n\"The only real difference between the two accounts of St. Luke and of\r\nJosephus is, that Josephus does not mention the stay of three months on\r\nthe island of Malta. He writes as if the ship were wrecked in the open\r\nsea, and he was saved by being at once taken up into the second ship.\r\nThis very great disagreement in the two narratives we must set to the\r\naccount of Josephus's inaccuracy. The second ship he rightly calls a\r\nship of Cyrene, for the Alexandrian vessel, in a favorable voyage, may\r\nhave touched at that port. He adds to the apostolic history the\r\ninteresting information, that it was through the Jewish actor,\r\nAlituries, that he, and, we may add, the Apostle and Christianity,\r\ngained an introduction into 'Caesar's household.' That Josephus sailed\r\nin the same ship with Paul, we may hold for certain. No Jews born in\r\nJudea had the privilege of Roman citizenship; of Jews who had that\r\nprivilege, the number was so small, that it is not probable that two\r\nsuch appeals to Rome, by Jews from the province of Judea, should have\r\nbeen allowed in the reign of Nero. That two ships, carrying such Hebrew\r\napplicants from Judea, should have been wrecked in the Adriatic, from\r\nboth of which the passengers should have been saved, and landed at\r\nPuteoli, and that within the space of three years, we may pronounce\r\nimpossible. So then the Jewish historian Josephus, when a young man,\r\nmade the voyage from Caesarea to Italy with the Apostle Paul, the\r\nEvangelist Luke, and their friend Aristarchus, and, for part of the way,\r\nwith the young Titus. He calls the Apostle his friend, though worldly\r\nprudence forbade his naming him. From these fellow-travellers he must\r\nhave heard the opinions of the Christians. He was able to contradict or\r\nconfirm all that they said of the founder of our religion, for he was\r\nborn only eight years after the crucifixion. But Josephus, when he wrote\r\nhis history and life, was a courtier, and even a traitor to his\r\ncountry--he wanted moral courage, he did not mean to be a martyr, and\r\nany testimony in favor of a despised sect is not to be expected from\r\nhim. The passage in his Antiquities in which Jesus is praised we may\r\ngive up as a forgery of the third century: it is enough for us to\r\nremark, that after having lived for five months with Paul on the voyage\r\nfrom Judea to Italy, he does not write against this earnest teacher of\r\nChristianity, as either a weak enthusiast or a crafty impostor. But he\r\npraises his piety and virtues, and boasts that he was of use in\r\nobtaining his release from prison.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Smith, to whom allusion is made above, is said to be a gentleman of\r\nliberal fortune, and to have carefully studied navigation, and in\r\nnumerous voyages in his yacht through these seas to have practised it,\r\nfor the especial purpose of investigating and illustrating the points\r\nembraced in this interesting portion of the sacred history. He has\r\npretty satisfactorily established the precise route of the Apostle on\r\nthis famous journey, which is the most universally familiar of all in\r\nancient or modern life. The curious suggestion of such personal\r\nrelations between Paul and Josephus is not new; it was made some time in\r\nthe seventh century in the Reflections of Bernardin Pastouret, and\r\nperhaps at an earlier time by others. The author whose words are here\r\nquoted, is Mr. John Sharpe, and he has very clearly presented the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNT MONTE-LEONE: OR, THE SPY IN SOCIETY.[N]\r\n\r\nTranslated For The International Monthly Magazine From the French of H.\r\nDe St. Georges.\r\n\r\n_Continued from page 359._\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. EXPLANATION OF THE ENIGMA.\r\n\r\nWhile the events we have described are taking place at Sorrento, we will\r\nretrace our steps to the Etruscan House, where we left Monte-Leone and\r\nTaddeo when the latter placed in the hands of the former the letter of\r\nLa Felina. The Count opened the letter, and read:\r\n\r\n\"Taddeo--You told me in the prison of the palace of the Dukes of Palma,\r\nwhither I went to find you, '_Love which speculates is not love. Mine\r\nwill obey you for obedience' sake. Try, however, to ask something grand\r\nand difficult, that you may judge it by its fruits._'\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you love her?\" said Monte-Leone, interrupting himself.\r\n\r\n\"Read on,\" said Taddeo.\r\n\r\n\"'Your heart, Taddeo, is noble,' replied I. 'I have faith in it. May God\r\ngrant that your strength do not betray your courage. In four days you\r\nwill learn what I expect from you.' I write down what I expect, for I\r\nhave not courage to tell you. I cannot crush your hopes, though I know\r\nthat they cannot be realized. The feelings you have avowed to me,\r\nTaddeo, demand entire confidence: for it would be a crime to deceive a\r\nheart like yours. I will therefore tell you the truth, painful as it may\r\nbe. It is a year since I came to Naples, having been attracted thither\r\nby a brilliant engagement at San Carlo. My success was as great as it\r\nhad been in the other capitals of Italy. After the applause and ovations\r\nof the public--the truest and most discriminating of all--came\r\nprivileged admirers; those, who, from their rank, birth, and fortune,\r\nhave a right to pass the curtain of the sanctuary, and cast incense at\r\nthe very foot of the idol; who can compliment the artiste on the stage,\r\nand follow her with their commonplaces to her very box. There was no\r\nscarcity of sacrificers. The noblest of Naples overwhelmed me with\r\nadulations; from compliments they came to declaration, and there, as at\r\nRome, Venice, and elsewhere, I was persecuted by the insipid gallantries\r\nof suitors, to which every successful artiste possessed of any personal\r\nattraction must submit. To all these advances my heart remained cold,\r\nand my insensibility cost me nothing; for I neither loved nor wished to.\r\nA strange event, however, changed my plans. It was an evening of last\r\nautumn, and the air was as sultry as possible. Exhausted by the heat of\r\nthe theatre, after the performance was over I sent my carriage home, and\r\nresolved, in company with my _confidante_, to return on foot. I avoided\r\nmy many suitors, and escaped from the theatre by a back-door. The air\r\nwas so pure, and the night so beautiful, that I walked for some time on\r\nthe _chiaja_. It was late when I returned homeward. Crossing an isolated\r\nstreet, which I had taken to shorten the walk, my _confidante_ and\r\nmyself were unexpectedly attacked by a party of men who stood beneath\r\nthe portico of a palace. They had well-nigh stifled our cries with\r\nscarfs, which had been thrown over our heads, and we should possibly\r\nhave been murdered, when a man, rushing sword in hand, I know not\r\nwhence, attacked our aggressors, disarmed three of them, whom he put to\r\nflight, and killed the fourth by a dagger-thrust. Rapidly as possible,\r\nhe then took off the bandages from our faces, and gave me, half dead\r\nwith terror, his arm.\r\n\r\n\"A carriage passed, the stranger called to it, placed us in it, and\r\nsaid: 'A lady, signora, of your appearance, met in the streets of Naples\r\nat such an hour, doubtless is under the influence of some secret motive\r\nshe would be unwilling to expose. My services to you have been too\r\nslight to warrant my questioning you. Now you have nothing to fear, and\r\nthis carriage will take you any where you please. I will inquire into no\r\norders which you may give.' 'But your name, signore?' said I. 'Count\r\nMonte-Leone,' said he, as he disappeared.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" said the Count. \"I never knew, though, whom I had\r\nrescued from the hands of bandits.\"\r\n\r\nHe then began again to read:\r\n\r\n\"From that time the Count was, in spite of myself, the object of my\r\nconstant thoughts and secret meditations. I was very anxious, at least,\r\nto know the features of the man, whom I had only seen in the dark; for\r\nthe services he had rendered me, the courage he had displayed, even the\r\nsound of his voice, spoke both to my head and heart. One day, as I was\r\ncrossing the street of Toledo, some young persons pointed out to me a\r\ncavalier, mounted on a noble horse. 'No one but Monte-Leone can ride\r\nsuch an animal as that. No one else rides so well.' 'He is the\r\nhandsomest and most brilliant of our young nobles,' said another. 'What\r\na pity he gives himself so completely to the people,' said a third. The\r\nCount, whom I saw then for the first time, was the realization of all my\r\nyouthful dreams and illusions. I loved the Count, though I did not know\r\nit. From the moment I saw him, my heart and soul were consecrated to\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nA painful sigh, uttered near Monte-Leone, made the Count look at young\r\nRovero, the pallor of whom indicated intense suffering.\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" said the Count, taking his hand, \"what matters it if Felina\r\nlove me, provided I do not love her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some day you may love her,\" said Taddeo.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Count.\r\n\r\n\"And why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I have but one heart, and that is another's.\"\r\n\r\nA happy smile lighted up the face of Rovero, and Monte-Leone continued\r\nto read, with as much _sang-froid_ as if another were the subject of the\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n\"You wished to know which of the four I loved; excuse me, Taddeo, but\r\nnow I have told you all. From that time I conceived an ardent devotion\r\nto Monte-Leone. My passion was, however, of that kind which only demands\r\nthe gratification of the soul. All I had heard of the Count's character,\r\nof his errors, follies, and numerous passions, far from alienating,\r\nrendered him still dearer to me. It seemed that his lofty, generous\r\ndisposition, full of courage and honor, had wanted nothing but a guide,\r\nor rather an angel, to wrest him from the torment of the life he had\r\nprepared for himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count paused, and reflected for a few moments, which seemed\r\ncenturies to Rovero. He then began again to read:\r\n\r\n\"Ah, had I met Monte-Leone in the days of my innocence, in the days when\r\nI also looked for some one to guide my early steps, with my hand in his,\r\nwith my heart beating against his, I should, perhaps, have avoided the\r\nrocks on which I have been wrecked? To the Count, however, I could be\r\nnow but an ordinary woman, whose attractions might, perhaps, for the\r\nmoment fascinate him, but whom he would soon cast aside, as he has his\r\nother conquests: then I feel _I should have killed him!_\"\r\n\r\nThe Count quietly read on:\r\n\r\n\"I loved him too fondly to become his mistress; yet his image pursued me\r\nby night and day. At last my heart, in its immense and pure love,\r\ninspired me with the noblest and purest idea: 'Be more than a woman, be\r\nmore than a mistress to him,' said I to myself, 'be a providence, a\r\nsecret and protecting providence which preserves him in all dangers, and\r\nprovides all his happiness.' Alas! I fancied that I had to defend\r\nMonte-Leone only against the ordinary perils of life, against the\r\nrivalry excited by his triumphs, and not against the serious dangers to\r\nwhich his opinions subjected him. I soon heard the rumors which were\r\nbeing circulated about the Count, learned of his danger, and the\r\nperilous part he had to play in relation to the secret societies. I\r\nlearned all this from public rumor, but I needed other aid and\r\ninformation to guide me in the defence of him I loved. Among those most\r\ncarried away by my talent, and if I must say so, most captivated by my\r\nbeauty, was the Duke of Palma, minister of police. I received the\r\nminister kindly, and without yielding to his persuasions, conferred\r\ntrifling favors on him. His confidence in me was immense. When I was\r\nstern to him he became desperate, but he professed there was such a\r\ncharm in my company that he sought constantly to see me. Minister as he\r\nwas, he became not my _sicisbeo_, for that I would consent to at no\r\nprice, but my _cavaliero sirviente_, thus occupying the second grand\r\nhierarchy of love. I learned from the minister himself the snares\r\nprepared for Monte-Leone, twenty times I informed your friend of them,\r\nand enabled him to avoid them. In the same manner I heard of your\r\nimprudent folly at the ball of San-Carlo, and you know what I did to\r\navert its consequences. A certain Lippiani, a skilful officer placed by\r\nmeans of my influence in the Neapolitan police, while paying a visit of\r\ninspection to the jailor of the Castle _Del Uovo_, contrived to\r\nintroduce into the prisoner's loaf the mysterious information he\r\nreceived. The imagination, or rather the genius of the Count, inspired\r\nhim with a design to secure his liberty. To assure the success of this\r\nruse, the Count escaped for some hours from his prison, and amid that\r\nseason of trouble, energy, and anguish, Monte-Leone lost the famous ring\r\nhe always wears. This loss again placed his life and liberty in danger.\r\nThen I conceived a hardy and bold plan, which cannot succeed without\r\nyour aid and devotion. On that, however, for you so promised me, I rely.\r\nI learned that you were a prisoner, but were about to be released. You\r\ncan then aid me, but it is necessary to awake no suspicion. Aware of\r\nevery outlet to the palace, which had often been shown to me by the Duke\r\nof Palma, I remembered a certain secret passage and door hidden in a\r\npillar, whither the Duke often comes, to hear, unseen, the examinations\r\nof prisoners. Thither I sought to come. The porter admitted me at night;\r\ndoubtless, fancying I was come to keep an appointment with his master.\r\nOf what value, however, were honor and reputation to me compared with\r\nhis danger. Now, Taddeo, read with attention the lines I am about to\r\nwrite; follow my advice exactly, or Monte-Leone is lost.\r\n\r\n\"I obtained possession for a few days of the emerald lost by the Count,\r\nand which had been sent by his enemies to the Duke of Palma. At a great\r\ncost I caused a similar one to be made by one of the most skilful\r\nworkmen of Naples. The copy will be easily recognized: _that is what I\r\nwish_. I have substituted it for the original, and placed it myself in\r\nthe minister's jewel case, the key of which he had given to me to take\r\nan antique _cameo_, the design of which I wished. The false ring will be\r\ngiven to the Count, instead of the true one, which is in the _coffret_ I\r\nhave placed by you. Go to Monte-Leone's house, during the night after\r\nyour release. I am too closely watched now, to dare go thither myself.\r\nGive this ring to the old servant, tell him to deliver it to the judges,\r\nbut not till the trial. The enemies of whom I spoke will be overcome by\r\nthis pretended proof of their imposition, and the safety of the Count\r\nwill be sure. I have told you all. Now, Taddeo, excuse me for having\r\npained you by my disclosure. Excuse me for having unfolded all my heart\r\nto you, excuse me for having permitted you to read my most secret\r\nsentiments. Your love deserves something better than mine; but if it\r\ninspire you with any pity for me, rescue the Count from the executioner,\r\nand know that to save Monte-Leone is to save La Felina.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a woman!\" said the Count, as he let fall the letter; \"what passion\r\nand devotion!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Taddeo, who looked anxiously into the eyes of the Count, to\r\ndivine the effect produced by the singer's letter, \"you see her devotion\r\npleases and touches you:--that you love her----\"\r\n\r\n\"Taddeo,\" said the Count, with great emotion, \"that woman was my\r\nprovidence, and defended me against my accusers.... She saved my\r\nlife.... It is a noble heart that thus hopelessly devotes itself. Let me\r\ngive her all my gratitude.... A poor and sterile recompense for such\r\ndevotion. The other sentiments of my heart you shall also know!\"\r\n\r\nRising up with the dignified and lofty air of a noble, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Taddeo Rovero, Count Monte-Leone asks of you the hand of Aminta Rovero,\r\nyour sister.\"\r\n\r\nJust then a painful exclamation was heard in the next room. Monte-Leone\r\nseized his dagger and rushed to the door. He threw it open, and a\r\nstrange spectacle presented itself to him. A woman, pale and trembling,\r\nleaned on the arm of an old man. Her eyes, fixed and tearful, seemed to\r\nlook without seeing, and her ears appeared to catch no sound. It was La\r\nFelina. She was sustained by old Giacomo.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, Monsignore, she was permitted to come in; for Signor Rovero,\r\nwhen he brought your ring, said you owed your safety to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Felina!\" said Taddeo. He fell at the singer's feet.\r\n\r\nShe remained motionless as a statue whose lips only were living.\r\n\r\n\"Signore Monte-Leone,\" said she, \"I leave Naples to-night, and for ever.\r\nBefore I did so, however, I wished to see and give you a piece of\r\nadvice. Death menaces you from all sides, and your most insignificant\r\nactions are observed. Escape from the country, for here you will no\r\nlonger find the faithful friends who have watched over you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, Signora, the _faithful friend_, the generous providence who saved\r\nme from the axe of the executioner.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know all, Signor,\" said La Felina; and she looked at Taddeo--\"my\r\nsecret has been revealed to you--for blushing, however, I now\r\nacknowledge with pride that it is true, for it has won for me the\r\nexpressions you uttered just now. Alas!\" said she bitterly, \"I should\r\nhave fled and have heard no more.\"\r\n\r\nTears filled her eyes; overcoming her emotion, however, she said:\r\n\r\n\"My mission is fulfilled, Count Monte-Leone, for you will live and be\r\nhappy. If misfortune, though, befall you, do not forget that one heart\r\nin the world will taste of all your sorrow.--Taddeo,\" said she, giving\r\nthe young man her hand, \"time and reason will exert their influence on\r\nso noble a heart, and ere long you will find one worthy of you. Forget\r\nme,\" she added, when she saw him about to reply, \"do not speak to me of\r\nsentiments the intensity of which I know--and I will assist you to\r\ntriumph. To-morrow you will love me less. I know so. To-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow!\" said Taddeo.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Felina, \"and in a little time I shall be but the shadow of a\r\ndream, which some reality will expel from your heart.\"\r\n\r\nShe went towards the door.\r\n\r\n\"Signori,\" said she, when she saw Monte-Leone and Taddeo preparing to\r\nfollow her, \"I came hither with confidence in the honor of two\r\ngentlemen, who, I am sure, will not leave the room until I shall have\r\nleft. Do not be afraid,\" she continued, with a faint smile on her lips,\r\n\"a carriage awaits, but not to convey me to the Castle _Del Uovo_.\"\r\n\r\nThen casting on the Count a glance instinct with sadness and regret, she\r\noffered her hand to Taddeo, who covered it with kisses, and preceded by\r\nGiacomo left the room. For some moments the two friends looked at each\r\nother in silence. Taddeo then went towards the door, saying:\r\n\r\n\"But I am a fool to let her escape thus.\"\r\n\r\nHe crossed the court and went to the door of the room. The carriage,\r\nhowever, was gone, and far in the distance he heard the sound of the\r\nwheels.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--A LAST APPEARANCE.\r\n\r\nThe hearts of Monte-Leone and of Taddeo Rovero were, after the departure\r\nof the singer, in very different conditions. Monte-Leone, delighted with\r\nthe present, and with the prospect of future success, to be attained as\r\nthe husband of Aminta, forgot all else--even the terrible responsibility\r\nwhich weighed on him as the chief of a faction of forbidden societies,\r\nand the perpetual dangers with which it menaced him. Monte-Leone had an\r\nenergetic heart but a volatile mind, over which the accidents of life\r\nglide like the runner of a sleigh over polished ice, almost without\r\nleaving traces.\r\n\r\nA circumstance of which we will speak of by and by, aroused the Count\r\nfrom his peace of soul to cast him in the waves of that sea of politics\r\nwhere shipwrecks are so common and tempests so usual. The only idea\r\nwhich occupied Taddeo was to see La Felina again. He said rightly enough\r\nthat the rays of such a star could not long be concealed; that its glory\r\nand success would always betray it, and that the farewell token of\r\nMonte-Leone in the Etruscan house would not be for ever.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence, then, of very different sentiments, the two friends\r\nreturned to the Count's hotel at Naples. Less beautiful than the\r\nmagnificent palace of Monte-Leone, it did not, like the latter, render\r\nindispensable the numerous and imposing array of servants, of which his\r\nsomewhat restricted fortune deprived Monte-Leone. Descried by its master\r\nduring the whole time of his seclusion, this hotel had been the scene of\r\nthe ruinous pleasures of the Count. Splendid festivals had been given\r\nthere; joyous suppers had been proposed, and the shadow of more than\r\none graceful dame, wrapped in silken folds, had been traced at midnight\r\non the great white marble wall of the portico.\r\n\r\nGiacomo, who had left the Etruscan house at an early hour, had\r\nsuperintended the preparation of the hotel for its master, and the\r\nunfolding of the tall wide windows made the house seem to stare on the\r\nsunlight, like blind persons who but recently have recovered their\r\nsight. The resuscitation of the hotel of Monte-Leone, as people in the\r\nToledo-street said, created a great sensation in that quarter. The Count\r\nand Taddeo had been there but a short time, when Giacomo, evidently in a\r\nvery bad humor, announced Signor Pignana. Many of the Count's friends\r\nwho had heard of his return came to see him and crowded around him. They\r\narose to leave when the new-comer was announced; but they paused when\r\nthey saw the strange person introduced.\r\n\r\n\"_Buon giorno caro mio Pignana_,\"[O] said the Count, advancing to meet\r\nhim. \"You are not the last to visit me, and I am deeply touched by your\r\nvisit. He is my landlord, Signori, an excellent man. Something of an\r\nArab, it is true, in money matters; but as he is an old tradesman, you\r\nsee it is impossible for him to change his habits. For twenty years he\r\nfurnished the family liveries, and the result is that now he is richer\r\nthan me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my Lord,\" said Pignana, \"you flatter me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, Signor,\" said Monte-Leone. \"Now you can yourself have\r\nliveries with the Pignana arms, '_Two winged shears on a field argent_,'\r\na regular tailor's escutcheon.\"\r\n\r\n\"How then,\" asked one of the young men, \"is Signor Pignana your\r\nlandlord--is it of this hotel or of your beautiful palace?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said the Count, \"he is not exactly my landlord yet, but he will be\r\nif my friend and creditor, Signor Pignana, continues to lend me money at\r\ncent. per cent. At present, however, the excellent man only owns my\r\nEtruscan house, a very gem of a thing, which he rents to me, and for\r\nwhich I am much obliged.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is I who am obliged,\" muttered Pignana.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said the Count, with a smile, \"I believe you. That house had\r\nnearly become historical. If the executioner of Naples, the father of a\r\nfamily, and passionately fond of flowers,\" continued the Count to his\r\nfriends, \"with whom I passed a fortnight at the Castle _Del Uovo_, had\r\nbeen forced to arrange matters for me, the house in which Monte-Leone\r\nwas arrested would have become historical. Pignana could have let it out\r\nto tourists, and could have retailed the stores for the London museums.\r\nInstead of this piece of good fortune, which I am very glad was not\r\nPignana's, he possesses a good tenant, who will some day pay him\r\npunctually, when he has himself been paid all that is due him; for you\r\ncan fancy how the arrest of one man discourages the business of others.\r\nAll his debtors, all the friends of his purse, leap with joy; he seems\r\nat once outlawed, especially to those who are indebted to him. The most\r\nhonest merely pray that his imprisonment may be prolonged; the least\r\ndelicate pray that the executioner may send them a receipt.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the Count also has some true friends who would be distressed at his\r\ndeath,\" said Pignana. \"Monsignore counts me among them.\"\r\n\r\nPignana probably uttered these words under the influence of great\r\nemotion, for a tear hung on the lid of his eye above an aquiline nose of\r\nimmense size.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Pignana,\" said the Count, \"I know how far I can depend on you,\r\nfor _I know you_.\"\r\n\r\nMonte-Leone accented this word, the significance of which to Pignana was\r\nvery expressive, for he looked proudly around, as if the Count had given\r\nhim a certificate of valor and courage.\r\n\r\n\"I am about to give you the list of our men--that is to say of our\r\ntransactions,\"[P] said the old man, eagerly correcting himself.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Monte-Leone, who had glanced sternly at him, \"the list of\r\nour transactions. Go on, Pignana, go on, prove your account and diminish\r\nthe total, contrary to your wont; above all, exhibit your vouchers; that\r\nis especially important.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not trouble yourself, Monsignore: I have all regular, and now you\r\nmust pay in person.\"\r\n\r\n\"In person,\" replied the Count. \"Yes, Pignana, I will thus discharge my\r\nobligations without having recourse to a third party. Go thither,\r\nhowever, at once,\" said he, and he pushed the tailor into the next room.\r\n\"You will find writing materials,\" he added, aside, \"and no one to\r\nlisten to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, Signori,\" said he, speaking to his friends; \"you have seen\r\none of the greatest misfortunes of our rank, the necessity of civility\r\nto a fool who is a creditor.\"\r\n\r\nJust then Taddeo Rovero, who had gone out when Pignana entered, came in,\r\nintroducing a handsome lad of about eighteen.\r\n\r\n\"Count,\" said he, to Monte-Leone, \"let me introduce you to Signor\r\nGaetano Brignoli, a friend of my family.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, Signor,\" said the Count, \"you are a friend of mine; for all whom\r\nthey love are dear to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Count,\" said Gaetano, \"how much uneasiness your trial has caused\r\nall at Sorrento! Especially to myself, who was particularly charged by\r\nthe charming Aminta to inform her of all the details of the trial. I set\r\nout on the night before your trial to be one of the first in the hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"I scarcely dare,\" said the Count, with an expression of great pleasure,\r\n\"to think the Signorina entertains such interest in my behalf.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not precisely of yourself that she spoke,\" replied Gaetano,\r\n\"but of my friend Taddeo, her brother, who was known to be compromised\r\nwith you, and about whom she, naturally enough, was interested.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count grew slightly pale as he saw this gratification wrested from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"By-the-by, Signori,\" said Gaetano, \"you have heard the news with which\r\nall the city and suburbs echo, and which makes almost as much noise as\r\nthe trial of the Count Monte-Leone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust,\" said the Count, bitterly, \"that the news is more pleasant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Infinitely more so,\" continued Gaetano. \"Every one is talking of it,\r\nand crazed with it--especially myself, who am a _pazzo per la musica_,\r\nlike the here of Fioravanti. You know, Signori, nothing is more pleasant\r\nthan to win again a pleasure we fancy to have been lost to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" said Taddeo, who had a presentiment that something pleasant was\r\nabout to be related. The very mention of music made him quiver.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Signori,\" said Gaetano, \"the Sicilian siren, the fairy _La\r\nFelina_, sings to-night at San Carlo.\"\r\n\r\n\"La Felina?\" said all the listeners at once.\r\n\r\n\"La Felina! impossible!\" said Rovero. \"She left Naples last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly she did,\" said Gaetano; \"and that makes the matter more\r\ncharming and pleasant. _La Felina_ has her caprices as all pretty women,\r\nand singers especially. That is the condition and very qualification of\r\ntalent. A _prima donna_ who did not keep the public uneasy about her\r\nhealth, her business, or her amours, one who did not outrage the\r\nmanager, would not be a complete woman. How could she? One does not earn\r\na hundred thousand francs a year for acting as if the salary was only a\r\nthousand crowns. It would be vulgar and common and altogether unbecoming\r\na fine lady. La Felina, therefore, annoyed by the effect produced on the\r\npublic mind by the drama of the Trial of Count Monte-Leone, which\r\noccupied the attention she thought should be engrossed by her own\r\nperformances, would not appear while the trial was going on. She was\r\nabout to throw up her engagement, and actually did so, when she was at\r\nthe Porta-Capuana. The patrons of the opera, with the empresario at\r\ntheir head, accompanied by the orchestra and troupe, not wanting an\r\nenormous crowd of other admirers of _la Diva_, and they are many,\r\nprevented the carriage from passing. She was surrounded, pressed, and\r\nbesought to such a degree that she was dragged back to her hotel, and\r\npromised to sing once more in the Griselda of the _Maestro Paer_, the\r\nbest of all her characters. You can fancy the enthusiasm thus excited,\r\nand how all struggle to secure seats. I paid for mine thrice the usual\r\nprice, and think I am very fortunate.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment Taddeo said nothing, he saw nothing, and scarcely breathed.\r\nHe was half stifled with joy and surprise. To see one again, from whom\r\nhe had expected to be separated for so long a time, and perhaps for\r\never, seemed to him a dream from which he seemed afraid to awake. The\r\nfriends of the Count left: all hurried to the theatre to secure an\r\nopportunity of being present at the solemnity.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come,\" said Taddeo, hurrying young Brignoli away. \"I must go to\r\nSan Carlo to-night at any price, even at that of my life!\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" said Gaetano, \"I did not think you so passionate a dilettante.\r\nYou exceed me--to pay for music with gold is well enough, but with\r\nlife--ah, that is altogether a different thing; mine is valuable, and I\r\nkeep it for greater occasions.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count stopped Rovero just as he was about to leave.\r\n\r\n\"What,\" said he, with an air of deep concern, \"will you not go with me\r\nto-morrow to Sorrento?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, to-morrow, for pity's sake,\" said Taddeo in a low tone. \"Let\r\nme be happy to-day, and I will devote all my life to you.\"\r\n\r\nHe left with Gaetano.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Monte-Leone, \"I will not wait a day, not an hour, before\r\nI see Aminta,--even if I go to Sorrento alone. I will go thither at\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible,\" said a grave voice behind the Count.\r\n\r\nThe latter turned around and saw Pignana, who had glided unseen from the\r\nroom as soon as he heard the young people leave.\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\" said the Count.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Monsignore?\" replied Pignana, who, casting aside the air and\r\nmanner of a retired tradesman, became a dry and cold old man with a\r\ndignified bearing. \"Because our brothers, terrified at your arrest, were\r\non the point of dissolving the _vente_.--Because, it has been reported\r\nthat your excellency was on the point of abandoning the cause, and\r\nlaying aside the functions of supreme chief:--Because, the principal\r\n_Carbonari_, the agent of whom I am, wish to be informed of your\r\nintentions, and to be assured by you personally that you will not\r\nabandon them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the Count, with a gesture of ill-restrained temper, for\r\nthese political embarrassments came in conflict with ideas which were\r\nfar dearer to him, \"that is the meaning of what you said just now. How\r\ncan I restore confidence to our associates? The Neapolitan police\r\nwatches over me; the least imprudence, the slightest exhibition of the\r\nexistence of our association, would revive all, and endanger the fate\r\nand future success of the society, and also my life. You have few men of\r\nenergy among you; you, who are one of the most devoted, trembled _in the\r\npresence of my friends_. You deserve to be hissed like a bad actor in a\r\ngood part! Listen to me, Pignana: I wish to be your chief; I wish to\r\nrisk a heavy stake in your cause; but now, especially when heavy matters\r\nweigh on me, I do not purpose to appear in _political comedy_. I wish\r\nto play a serious part, the theories of which are actions, with many\r\ndeeds and few words. I will do all that is necessary to serve our cause,\r\nbut nothing more. Remember this. The Castle _Del Uovo_, dungeons beneath\r\nthe sea, the executioner and conversations with the Grand-Judge, warn me\r\nto be careful and prudent. Ask me, then, nothing more. In eight days our\r\ngreat general _venta_ will be held at the monastery of San Paola, fifty\r\nleagues from Naples. I will be there, and will tell you what our\r\nbrethren in France and Germany have informed me of. Until then, however,\r\nquestion me about nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"We do not, Monsignore,\" replied Pignana, who was aware of the firmness\r\nof the Count, and saw at once that he had mistaken his course. \"The\r\nassociation, which admires your excellency, especially since the trial,\r\nwhich looks on your excellency as a martyr, asks nothing except one\r\nfavor, which will overwhelm it with gratitude and joy.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is that favor?\" rejoined the Count.\r\n\r\n\"That Monsignore will appear to-night at San Carlo in a box, the key of\r\nwhich I have with me. This box may be seen from every part of the house.\r\nAll of our principal men will be present, and if Monsignore will\r\nadvance, during the interlude, to the front of the box, _placing his\r\nhand on his heart_, all our friends will know that they may rely on\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"By my faith, shrewd as the Duke of Palma is, suspicious as the police\r\nmay be, I do not think this can be construed into an act of treason. It\r\npledges me to nothing. The ladies to whom we make the gesture understand\r\nit. I will then make this exhibition of my person, as the English say,\r\nand I will increase the interest of the performance by my presence. In a\r\nword, I will appear for the benefit of La Felina. The brave girl and\r\nmyself will not even then be quits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Count,\" said Pignana, as he left--\"and now, adieu, until we\r\nmeet at San Carlo.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few hours after the scene we have described, an immense crowd thronged\r\nevery entry to the theatre of San Carlo. It was not, however, the joyous\r\ncrowd intoxicated with folly which we have seen hurry into its precincts\r\nat the commencement of this story. On this occasion the public seemed\r\nrather busy than in search of pleasure. It was a matter of importance,\r\nindeed, to be present at the last appearance of La Felina. The keys of\r\nthe boxes, therefore, according to the Italian custom, were sold at the\r\ndoor of the theatre, and at double the usual price. I speak only of the\r\nsmall number of boxes, the proprietors of which were absent from Naples.\r\nWe may also as well add, that in Naples a box is often _property_. All\r\nthe other boxes were occupied by illustrious personages, or by the\r\nwealthiest inhabitants of the great city. San Carlo on that night was\r\nbrilliant as possible. The Count had just come. The women glittered with\r\nflowers and diamonds. As on the occasion of the masked ball, the theatre\r\nwas illuminated _a giorno_. No detail of the festival, no beauty present\r\ncould escape observation. Count Monte-Leone appeared in the box which\r\nhad been reserved for him, which soon became the object of every\r\nlorgnette and the theme of every conversation. He bore this annoying\r\nattention with icy _sang-froid_, seeming even not to observe it. His\r\nvanity, however, was secretly gratified, and we have said that this was\r\nhis weak point. The overture began, and the curtain was finally raised.\r\nDuring this time, and the first scenes of the opera, the private\r\nconversation was so loud and animated that the singers and orchestra\r\nwere almost overpowered. Suddenly silence was restored--admiration as\r\nrespectful as that which precedes a sovereign's arrival pervaded all.\r\n\r\nThe true Queen of Naples, at this moment, was La Felina. This complete\r\ncalmness was soon succeeded by a thunder of applause. A thousand voices\r\nuttered a long shout of commingled bravos and hurras. La Felina was on\r\nthe stage. This delirium produced by a single person, this passionate\r\nworship expressed by an almost furious admiration, those thousand hearts\r\nhung to the lips of a single person, is found only on the stage, and was\r\none of the triumphs which Naples decreed to the greatest artist in\r\nItaly. A report was in circulation, also, which added to this almost\r\nfurious admiration. It was said, that she was about to retire for ever,\r\nand that this was her last appearance. The eyes of love have a secret\r\nand admirable instinct, enabling them to see what persons who are\r\nindifferent cannot discover. Among this eager and compact crowd, the\r\nglances of La Felina were immediately attracted to a point of the hall,\r\nto a single box in which Monte-Leone sat. To him Felina acted and sang,\r\nand she was sublime. At the moment when Paer's heroine appeared, a\r\nsingle voice was heard above all others, and the person who had uttered\r\nit, having exhausted all the powers of his soul, during the whole time\r\nFelina was on the stage, stood with his eyes fixed on her, as if he had\r\nbeen fascinated by some charm he could not shake off.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Taddeo,\" said the Count, when he saw him, \"why does she not love\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\nThe first act was concluded by a torrent of bouquets, which the audience\r\nthrew at the feet of their favorite actress. The curtain fell. This was\r\nthe moment expected by the associate of Monte-Leone. Faithful to his\r\npromise, the Count leaned forward in his box, naturally as possible, and\r\nlooked around the brilliant assembly. He then placed his hand on his\r\nheart, and disappeared in the recess of his box. Before, however, he\r\nleft, he heard a confused and joyous murmur, which rose from the parquet\r\nto the boxes, and became lost in the arch of the gilded ceiling.\r\n\r\n\"_They were there_,\" said Monte-Leone, \"and Pignana must be satisfied. I\r\nhave done all he asked literally.\"\r\n\r\nA few friends joined the Count in his box.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, dear Monte-Leone,\" said one of these, with whom he was most\r\nintimate, a friend of his childhood, \"You have resumed your old habits.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"That, scarcely out of prison, I saw you from my box beginning a new\r\nintrigue by exchanging signs with some fair unknown. This, too, at San\r\nCarlo. This is bold, indeed, unless the hand on your heart is the\r\nresumption of an old intrigue, interrupted, perhaps, by your\r\nimprisonment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand you, Barberini,\" said the Count, not a little\r\nannoyed. \"I made no sign to any one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps so: if you please, I was mistaken. But if I am, it is all the\r\nbetter; for it proves to me that you no longer adhere to the plans you\r\nonce confided to me. I was delighted, too, at what I heard yesterday\r\nevening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what plans do you speak?\" replied the Count, moved, in spite of\r\nhimself, by this half-confidence.\r\n\r\n\"Mon Dieu! of your own. Did you not tell me that you were passionately\r\nfond of the sister of Taddeo de Sorrento, of the beautiful Aminta\r\nRovero, daughter of the old minister of finances of Murat?\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said the Count.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" continued Barberini, \"I hope you are cured of that love, for you\r\nhave a rival.\"\r\n\r\n\"A rival!\" said the Count.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and perhaps a happy one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Signor,\" said Monte-Leone, restraining himself with difficulty, \"let me\r\ntell you I purpose to make that lady my wife. All that touches her\r\nhonor, touches mine also.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say nothing derogatory to it, but merely repeat what I have heard.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you heard?\" said Monte-Leone, and the blood rushed to his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"One of my young relations,\" continued Count Barberini, \"was at an\r\nentertainment given on the recurrence of her daughter's birthday by\r\nSignora Rovero. He spoke to me of a Frenchman who is with them, and who\r\nseems passionately fond of the young Aminta.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\" said Monte-Leone, with the same tone in which he would have\r\nasked the executioner to strike him with certainty.\r\n\r\n\"And then! why that is all,\" said Barberini, who had become terrified at\r\nMonte-Leone's manner. \"I heard nothing more.... If I did, I would take\r\ncare to be silent when you look so furiously. All this interests me very\r\nslightly. One's own love affairs are too troublesome to enable us to\r\noccupy ourselves with those of others.... There, too, is the Countess\r\nd'Oliviero, waving her bouquet so impatiently to and fro that I see she\r\nwill break it to pieces unless I go. I must leave you, to save her\r\nflowers.\" The young man left.\r\n\r\n\"I was right,\" said he, \"not to tell the story of the night affair of\r\nwhich my kinsman was a witness. I think he would have killed me at\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. A PATERNAL LETTER\r\n\r\nOn the day after the terrible night during which Aminta had strayed in\r\nher sleep to the room of Maulear, two ladies met at about nine in the\r\nmorning in the saloon of the villa of Sorrento, and were locked in each\r\nother's arms.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my child,\" said one of them, \"your sleep has given an\r\ninterpretation to all that has passed, and I understand all. Your honor\r\ncannot suffer, for you are chaste and pure.\"\r\n\r\n\"In your eyes, dear mother, I am; but in those of the world, which they\r\ntell me is so envious and malicious! Even last night, when every eye was\r\nfixed on me, I fancied that I read suspicion and contempt in the\r\nexpression of more than one.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my child,\" replied Signora Rovero, clasping her to her heart, \"I\r\nsaw almost all our guests this morning, immediately before they left.\r\nThey had already heard of your somnambulism, and our servants had told\r\nhow you suffered with it from your childhood. All are convinced of your\r\ninnocence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear mother, do not think so. They spoke to you only with their lips,\r\nbut believe me guilty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother,\" added she, with that strange emotion to which she was\r\nsometimes a victim, \"I think that this unfortunate affair is but the\r\nbeginning of the realization of the unfortunate fate which I know is\r\nreserved for me. It seems to me that on yesterday our evil days began.\"\r\n\r\nShe hid her head in her mother's bosom to conceal her tears, and to find\r\na refuge against the misfortunes she feared.\r\n\r\nA servant came in, and said, \"The Marquis de Maulear wishes to wait on\r\nthe ladies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother, mother,\" said Aminta, \"how can I refrain from blushing before\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\nSignora Rovero bade the servant show the Marquis in. Then arranging\r\nAminta's beautiful hair, she kissed her forehead, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Daughter, one never blushes in the presence of a husband.\"\r\n\r\nAminta, with great surprise, looked at her mother.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, ah!\" said Madame Rovero, with a smile, \"a parent's eyes see much.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Aminta had time to speak, the Marquis entered. He was pale and\r\nexcited.\r\n\r\n\"Signora,\" said he to Aminta's mother, \"I come to beg you to pardon me\r\nfor a great fault.\"\r\n\r\n\"To what, Signor, do you refer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of the greatest of all faults, after the manner in which I have been\r\nreceived, and your kindness towards me--for not having confided in you,\r\nand said yesterday what I wish to say to-day. Yet only from you have I\r\nkept my secret. Yesterday, nothing obliged you to grant me the favor I\r\nam about to solicit: yesterday, you might have refused it. To-day,\r\nperhaps, it will be less difficult. A circumstance favorable only to\r\nmyself,\" added he, with a timid glance at Aminta, \"marks out my\r\nconduct, which assumes now the aspect of an obligation. It fulfils all\r\nmy wishes, and makes me the happiest of men. In one word, signora, I\r\ncome to beg that you will suffer me to become allied to your family.\"\r\n\r\n\"Marquis,\" said Signora Rovero, \"I expected to hear you speak thus, for\r\nI was sure of your honor. But far from wishing that now for the first\r\ntime you had informed my daughter of the sentiments with which she has\r\ninspired you, I rejoice that your course has been different. Without\r\nthis motive, signor, neither my daughter nor I would accept the alliance\r\nyou wish to offer us. _No reparation can be exacted, where no fault has\r\nbeen committed._ I wish to strengthen your conscience, by assuring you,\r\nthat in my opinion nothing obliges you to the course you have adopted,\r\nif it interferes with your prospects and success.\"\r\n\r\nThe last expressions of Signora Rovero produced a deep sensation on\r\nMaulear, and a shadow of uneasiness passed over his brow. She had\r\nignorantly touched a sensitive chord of the heart of the young lover.\r\nLed astray by his heart, seduced invincibly by charms which were so new\r\nto him, Maulear, under the influence of passion, had entered on the\r\nflowery route, at the end of which he caught a glimpse of happiness. In\r\nthe delirium of passion, he had forgotten that a severe judge, that the\r\nimperious master of his destiny, that a father, with principles\r\neminently aristocratic, like all fathers in 1768, awaited to absolve or\r\nacquit him, to receive or repel him, to unite or to sever--in one word,\r\nto make him happy or miserable. All these important ideas were at once\r\nevoked in the mind of Maulear by the last sentence Signora Rovero had\r\nuttered. It was this hidden and sombre apparition which arose between\r\nMaulear and her he loved, the sinister aspect of which was reflected in\r\na manner by the expression of Aminta's lover.\r\n\r\nSignorina Rovero perceived it, and with the acute discrimination she\r\npossessed to so high a degree, said, in the melodious tones which\r\ntouched all who heard them:\r\n\r\n\"Marquis, my mother has spoken for her family, I will speak for myself.\r\nYou have informed us of the noble family to which you belong. I know\r\nthat your wife one day will be a princess, and I wish you to remember,\r\nthat she, to whom you offer this title, is the daughter of 'a noble of\r\nyesterday;' the glory of whom is derived from her daughter's virtues.\r\nThis, Marquis, I say not for you, but for others. Excuse me, too, for\r\nwhat you are about to hear. If I have need of courage to own it to you,\r\nperhaps you will require all your generosity to hearken to it.\" With a\r\ntrembling voice she added: \"As yet, I do not reciprocate the sentiments\r\nyou have expressed. To the hope, though, which I permitted you to\r\nentertain yesterday, let me add, that I am additionally gratified by the\r\noffer of your hand; for in the eyes of many persons, signor, in the eyes\r\nof those who were witnesses of our presence together last night, you\r\nwould not now marry her you were anxious to espouse yesterday.\r\n\r\n\"I shall marry an angel!\" said Maulear, falling on his knees before\r\nAminta, \"an angel of candor and virtue. If your heart does not yet\r\nreciprocate the love you inspire, my care and tenderness will so delight\r\nyou, that some day you will love me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said she to Maulear, \"grant me one favor. Suffer me to\r\nawait that day. Take pity on a poor girl full of terror and\r\napprehension, at a tie she has always feared. Grant her heart time to\r\nmake itself worthy of you, Marquis, and remember that until then you are\r\nfree. As my mother has told you, nothing binds you to me. Now you owe me\r\nnothing, nor will you, until I shall confide my destiny to your hands,\r\nwhen you will owe me the happiness you promise me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not consent? Then, Signorina, I will wait. Henceforth, however,\r\nI am pledged _to you_; and my hand and heart are yours.\"\r\n\r\nJust then a servant told Maulear that a courier from Naples had brought\r\nhim important letters. The Marquis bade adieu to the two ladies, and\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n\"My child,\" said Signora Rovero, in a tone of affectionate reproach,\r\n\"what must a man do to win your love?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know; I am certainly foolish, but I am afraid!\"\r\n\r\nMaulear found the courier of the French embassy in his room. \"An urgent\r\nletter from France,\" said he, to Maulear.\r\n\r\nHenri read the direction and shuddered. It was from the Prince de\r\nMaulear. The Prince wrote rarely. What did he ask? The son who felt that\r\nhe had acted incorrectly in disposing of his hand, without consulting\r\nthe head of his family, trembled before he broke the seal. The character\r\nof Maulear was weak, as we have said, and, like people of this kind, the\r\nprospect of danger and misfortune annoyed him more than the reality\r\nitself. At last he resolved to know all, and with a trembling hand\r\nopened the letter. He read as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Paris, April 10, 1816.\r\n\r\n\"MY SON:--I often hear of you, not through your own letters, for you\r\nwrite rarely, but through other friends, whom I have requested to keep\r\nme _au fait_. I know what kind of life you lead at Naples, and am\r\ndissatisfied with you. The son of a shop-keeper and a banker would act\r\nmore like a gentleman than you. People talk of you here no better than\r\nthey do of the deputy of the hangman. I had hoped the Marquis de Maulear\r\nwould behave more correctly in a foreign country. I was no older than\r\nyou are, when I went as secretary of legation to Madrid. Three months\r\nafterwards I was recalled. I had run away with three women, fought four\r\nduels, and lost at cards fifty thousand crowns. That was something to be\r\nrecalled for. It was an assurance that in future I would be reasonable.\r\nWhen our youth reasons, and does not laugh, things go wrong. The King\r\nspoke to me yesterday about you. He asked me, if you found any thing to\r\namuse you at Naples. I replied that you found too much to amuse you. 'I\r\nam glad of it,' said the King, 'so our family honor at least is saved.'\r\nSince, however, you are most ignobly virtuous, I have tried to turn the\r\naffair to the best advantage. I have brought about a magnificent match\r\nfor you, to supersede one I have heard you were making for yourself. The\r\nlady is rich, noble, and beautiful. She is the daughter of the Duke\r\nd'Harcourt, one of the gentlemen in waiting of his majesty. You may,\r\nperhaps, at Naples have seen Rene d'Harcourt, the brother of the lady.\r\nThe marriage will take place three months hence. I trust I have\r\nsurprised you not unpleasantly. Adieu, my son. Your aunt, the Countess,\r\nsends her love to you, and amuses herself with the preparation of your\r\n_corbeille_.\r\n\r\n    \"LE PRINCE DE MAULEAR.\r\n\r\n\"P.S. You have three months' more folly before you, and for the rest of\r\nyour life you must be prudent. I have opened a credit of one hundred\r\nthousand livres in your favor, with the banker Antonio Lamberti.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter fell from the hands of the Marquis, and he sank on his chair\r\ncompletely overwhelmed. Like a thunder-bolt, it aroused him from a happy\r\ndream. There are, in fact, in all love matters, certain moments of\r\nintoxication, when men, ordinarily sensible, become blunderers. For a\r\nmonth the Marquis had been in this condition, half reasonable, half mad.\r\nLiving with one thought prominent, all others were indistinct to him. To\r\nhim love was every thing. His father, with his antiquated obstinacy,\r\nimbued with retrograde principles, disappeared like a ghost before the\r\nbrilliant reality of passion. Besides, fear of a rival, dread of the\r\nbrilliant Count Monte-Leone, who, full of love, as Henri had heard,\r\naspired to nothing more than to become the husband of Aminta left him no\r\nother alternative, than to do what another was about to--make an\r\noffering of his hand and faith. Lovers, too, see nothing but the object\r\nof their passion; and Henri sometimes thought his father would agree\r\nwith him. The strange epistle of the Prince had however reversed all his\r\ndreams. The anger of the Prince when he should learn that a marriage had\r\nbeen contracted, contrary to his wishes, and in spite of his orders,\r\nmight possibly exert a terrible influence on the fortune and future fate\r\nof the young couple; without regarding the chagrin and humiliation to\r\nwhich he would subject Aminta by bringing her into a family without the\r\nconsent of its head.\r\n\r\nMaulear passed three days in this cruel perplexity, sometimes hoping and\r\nthen fearing that Aminta would yield to his prayer. His heart wished.\r\nHis mind feared. If Signorina Rovero should accept his hand, it would be\r\nnecessary for him to decide, to act; and then, from the weakness of his\r\ncharacter, Maulear would be subjected to cruel uncertainty.\r\n\r\nA few days after the scene which had occurred in his room, Maulear and\r\nthe ladies sat together in a boudoir near the _salon_, which opened on\r\nthe park, a view of which Aminta was taking. The Marquis had been\r\nreading to the ladies the trial of Count Monte-Leone from the _Diario di\r\nNapoli_. This curious story, full of surprises, the noble energy, the\r\nwonderful _sang-froid_ of the Count, the remarks of the journalist on\r\nthe character of the prisoner, and the unjust accusation to which he had\r\nbeen subjected, and which he had so completely refuted, and to which he\r\nhad submitted with such nobleness and heroism, all was listened to with\r\nthe greatest interest. Maulear had read all this much to his own\r\ndissatisfaction, because Signora Rovero had requested it. The praises of\r\nMonte-Leone were most unpleasant to him.\r\n\r\nAminta heard every word. Every detail of the Count's daring, every\r\nchange of character in this judicial drama, awakened an inexplicable\r\nemotion in her. It seemed that Count Monte-Leone, to whose singular\r\nstory she had listened, was a far different man from the one she had\r\nimagined him to be. His powerful mind, his exalted soul, all the powers\r\nof which had been developed by the trial, conferred on Monte-Leone new\r\nproportions hitherto not realized by her. Count Monte-Leone, whom she\r\nhad seen at home, almost timid in the presence of her he adored, annoyed\r\nby his false position as a refugee, suffering from a passion he dared\r\nnot own, was not the person of whom she had heard for the past month.\r\nLooking down on her drawing, which her increasing absence of mind made\r\nalmost invisible to her, Aminta sought to recall the features of the\r\nCount which had been nearly effaced from her memory. Gradually, however,\r\nthey arose before her. Had her mother then spoken, had her glances been\r\ndiverted from the album on which they were fixed, a strange trouble and\r\nconfusion would have been visible, when aroused from this meditation.\r\nThe sound of wheels entering the court yard of the villa broke the charm\r\nwhich entranced Aminta, and made Signora Rovero utter a cry of joy.\r\n\r\n\"It is he,\" cried she. \"It is he who returns, my son Taddeo. Daughter,\r\nlet us hurry to meet him. Let us be the first to embrace him.\"\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Maulear, the two ladies hurried into the vestibule, which\r\nthey crossed, standing at the villa-door just as the carriage stopped. A\r\nman left it and bowed respectfully to Signora Rovero and her daughter.\r\nThis man was MONTE-LEONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--TWO RIVALS.\r\n\r\nMuch had passed since Count Barberini had told Monte-Leone of the love\r\nof Maulear for Aminta Rovero. Monte-Leone felt all the furies of hell\r\nglide into his heart at this revelation. The idea that Aminta could love\r\nany one had never entered his mind. Whether from confidence in her, or\r\nfrom that error so common to lovers that they are entitled to love\r\nbecause they love themselves, Monte-Leone flattered himself that he had\r\nleft a pleasant recollection in Aminta's mind. We may therefore imagine\r\nhow painfully the Count was disturbed by the half-confidence of\r\nBarberini. Yet Taddeo, his friend, whom, he loved as a brother, could\r\nnot have deceived him, and have concealed what had taken place at\r\nSorrento, when he had received so cordially the hand of his sister.\r\nTaddeo, then, was ignorant of it. Monte-Leone, a prey to a thousand\r\nthoughts, left his box, forgetful of the opera, his friends and\r\ncompanions, with but one object and wish. He was determined to see\r\nTaddeo, to question him and find out who was the rival that menaced his\r\nhappiness, and whom Aminta probably loved. The Count went to that part\r\nof the theatre in which he had seen Aminta. The second act, however, was\r\nabout to begin; and the efforts of Monte-Leone to get near his friend\r\ncreated such murmurs, complaints, and anger, that he was obliged to wait\r\nfor a more favorable opportunity. La Griselda was singing the _andante_\r\nof her cavatina, and the artist's magnificent, powerful, and tender\r\nvoice, echoing through the vastness of the hall, fell in pearly notes\r\nlike a shower of diamonds on the ears of the spectators. After the\r\n_andante_ came the _caballeta_, and then the _coda-finale_. For a while\r\none might have thought the four thousand spectators had but one breath,\r\nand were animated by a single heart, that they restrained the first to\r\nprevent the pulsations of the other from being disturbed. This gem of\r\nthe opera was at last concluded, and mad applause rose from every part\r\nof the room. We are constrained, however, to say, that from this time\r\nthe accents of La Felina were less passionate and brilliant, and that a\r\nveil, as it were, was extended over all the rest of the representation,\r\nso that a person who had heard only the second act of La Griselda would\r\nhave asked with surprise, if it was really the wonderful prima donna,\r\nthe songs of whom were purchased with gold, and the wonderful talent of\r\nwhom, had enslaved the audiences of the great Italian theatres. The\r\nreason was, that, after the second act, the star which shone on La\r\nFelina had become eclipsed. Monte-Leone had left his box--the box which\r\nhad been the source of Griselda's inspiration from the commencement of\r\nthe first act. Hope had sustained the singer during the cavatina, at the\r\nbeginning of the second act. She fancied that he whom she loved possibly\r\nheard her from the recess of some other box. When, however, she was\r\nsatisfied that he was gone, despair took possession of her. \"Nothing\r\ntouches his heart,\" said she, with pain. \"Neither my love nor my talent\r\nare able to captivate him--to attach him to me for a time.\" Thenceforth,\r\nas she sang for him alone, she sang for no one. The holy fire was\r\nextinguished. Genius unfurled its wings and flew to the unknown regions\r\nof art, whence passion had won it. La Felina finished the opera, as a\r\nprima donna should, rendering the music precisely and distinctly, note\r\nfor note, and as her score required. She neither added a single\r\n_fioritura_ nor a single ornament which had not been noted by the\r\ncomposer. In one word, the audience at San Carlo on that day heard the\r\nopera of the _Maestro_ Paer and not La Felina. During this, Monte-Leone,\r\nwho had given up all hopes of reaching Taddeo, and whom Taddeo, paying\r\nattention only to the _artiste_, had neither heard nor seen, Monte-Leone\r\nwalked in front of the opera-house, a prey to the greatest agitation,\r\nimpatiently waiting for the conclusion of the representation, to see his\r\nfriend and hear from him what he had to hope or fear at Sorrento.\r\n\r\nThe opera ended. The crowd slowly dispersed, and Monte-Leone, wrapped up\r\nin his cloak, watched with anxiety every spectator who left the theatre.\r\nTaddeo did not come. The doors of the theatre were closed, and the Count\r\nstill waited. Surprised and impatient he went to his hotel, where Taddeo\r\nalso lived, but he was not there. Night passed away, and he did not\r\ncome. About three in the morning a stranger was shown in, and gave\r\nMonte-Leone three letters. One of them was addressed to the Count: he\r\nopened it anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, my dear friend, at quitting you thus. Excuse me, especially\r\nthe uneasiness I have created in your mind\"--wrote Taddeo--\"I have\r\nlearned that she left Naples to-night, and if I leave her I shall die. I\r\nwill follow her by post and on horseback, without stopping, until I\r\nshall learn whither she has gone. What will I do then! I do not\r\nknow,--but at least I will know where she is, and I will not fancy that\r\nshe is lost to me for ever. 'To-morrow,' said she, when she left us,\r\n'you will love me less.' She was mistaken, my friend, or she has\r\ndeceived me; for to-day I love her better than I did yesterday. My heart\r\nsuffers too much for me not to sympathize with yours, and I understand\r\nhow impatient you are to go to Sorrento. I send a letter to my good\r\nmother--give it yourself to her. I beg her to receive you as a friend,\r\nand as she would receive a brother of mine. Stay with her until I come\r\nback. Say that in three days I will come back to ask her to give you\r\nAminta's hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has the person who gave you these letters gone?\" asked Monte-Leone of\r\nthe messenger.\r\n\r\n\"He went an hour since from the post-house, on one of our best horses,\"\r\nsaid the messenger.\r\n\r\nMonte-Leone gave him a piece of gold and dismissed him.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Taddeo!\" said he, \"to suffer as well as I do--no no, not so much\r\nas I do; for earthly love cannot be compared with heavenly passion.\r\nJealousy such as I suffer can be compared to nothing; and all is derived\r\nfrom the serpent's stings, with which Barberini pricked my heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe time until day seemed interminable to Monte-Leone. It came at last.\r\nThe Count rang for Giacomo and dressed himself elegantly. The old man\r\non this occasion assisted him cheerfully and zealously, as he had\r\npreviously shown repugnance on the night of the terrible expedition at\r\nTorre-del-Greco. Monte-Leone ordered his handsomest equipage. A few\r\nminutes afterwards the horses pawed impatiently in the court-yard, so\r\nthat the driver could with difficulty restrain them. When the Count came\r\ndown, he found Giacomo standing in the door of the saloon so as to bar\r\nhis egress. Pale and agitated, the old man restrained the Count, and in\r\na stern, quarrelsome voice said:\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter now? what new folly are you about to commit?\"\r\n\r\n\"What the devil do you mean?\" asked the Count, taking hold of the\r\nintendant's hand.\r\n\r\n\"No, Monsignore, you shall not go,\" said Giacomo, extending his arms so\r\nas completely to shut the door, \"unless you serve me as you did Stenio\r\nSalvatori. Is it not a shame that the noblest of the gentlemen of\r\nNaples, that the son of my master, should walk abroad armed like the\r\nbravo of Venice--with a sword, poniard and pistol in his bosom? What, if\r\nyou please, was that box of pistols, placed by little Jack, your groom,\r\nas those animals are called in England, in your carriage?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it to you?\" said the Count, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"What is it to me?\" asked the old man with tears in his eyes. \"Are you\r\nnot again about to risk your life against I know not whom nor why? What\r\nis it to me? That you may live, that my last days may not be passed in\r\nuneasiness and despair, like those which have gone by--for I love you.\r\nCount,\" said the old man, kneeling before his master, \"I love you as a\r\nfather loves his son. I held you in my arms when you were a child. For\r\nheaven's sake renounce your dangerous plans, renounce the acquaintance\r\nof those rascally mysterious looking men who come so often to see you.\r\nHave nothing to say to that rascally Signor Pignana, whom I would so\r\ngladly see hung. Be again happy, gay, and joyous, as you used to he.\r\nTrue, we were ruining ourselves, but we were not conspirators.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count gave his hand to Giacomo.\r\n\r\n\"Giacomo, my good fellow,\" said he, \"I am about to engage in no\r\nconspiracy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am about to marry,\" said Monte-Leone, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Marry! with a case of pistols as a wedding present?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why!\" said the Count, moodily, \"I may perhaps meet enemies on the road.\r\nNow I have more than life to protect: I have my honor.\"\r\n\r\nMonte-Leone, making an affectionate gesture to the old man, descended\r\ngayly and sprang into the coach, which bore him rapidly towards\r\nSorrento, and stopped at the door of Signora Rovero's house, as we have\r\npreviously said.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw Monte-Leone, instead of Taddeo, Signora Rovero trembled.\r\n\r\n\"Signor,\" said she to the Count, \"for heaven's sake tell me what evil\r\ntidings you bear. What misfortune has befallen Taddeo?\"\r\n\r\n\"In two days, Signora, Taddeo will be here, and I have the difficult\r\nduty to excuse his absence. He has, however, asked me to deliver you his\r\nletter, which explains all.\"\r\n\r\nSignora Rovero took the letter and opened it with eagerness.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, Signor,\" said she to the Count, \"but you must make allowance\r\nfor a mother's anxiety.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it,\" she observed, after having read it. \"Taddeo is in no danger\r\nif we except that his fortune may be bad. A hunting party in the\r\nmountains will detain him for two days from us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Count,\" said Signora Rovero, \"my son speaks so affectionately of you\r\nthat I am led to offer you my own love.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have the advantage in that respect, Signora, for the kindness with\r\nwhich you treated me while here, and the memories I bore away, have ever\r\nsince inspired the deepest affection for you.\"\r\n\r\nThey entered the saloon, and Signora Rovero introduced Maulear to\r\nMonte-Leone. They saluted each other with the most exquisite politeness,\r\nbut without exchanging a glance.\r\n\r\nBetween love and hate there is this in common: it sees without the eye;\r\nit hears without the ear. Love has a presentiment of love, and hatred of\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\nMonte-Leone approached Aminta. All his power and energy were\r\ninsufficient to triumph over the violent agitation which took possession\r\nof him when he spoke to the young girl. His loving heart offered but\r\nfaint opposition to the torrent of passion, which had been so long\r\nrepressed that it was ready to bear away every obstacle. Aminta blushed\r\nand became troubled when she recognized in the vibration of his voice\r\nall the emotion Monte-Leone experienced. The conversation became\r\ngeneral. Signora Rovero spoke to the Count of his trial, the incidents\r\nof which the Marquis had been kind enough to read. The Count bowed to\r\nthe Marquis as if to acknowledge a favor. Maulear looked away to avoid\r\nthe necessity of acknowledging it. The Count seemed not to perceive it.\r\nAminta became aware that if he kept silent longer the circumstance would\r\nbe remarked.\r\n\r\n\"During your imprisonment, Count, in the Castle _Del Uovo_, I have heard\r\nthat a terrible episode occurred, the details of which the _Diaro_ does\r\nnot give.\"\r\n\r\n\"The reason was the _Diario_ did not know them. True, like other\r\njournalists he might have invented them, but he did not do so; and,\r\nperhaps, acted well, for his fancies could not have equalled the truth.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count then simply, without exaggeration, and especially without that\r\npetition for pity which is so frequently met with, told the story of the\r\nterrible scene in the prison.\r\n\r\nAminta listened to every word. She suffered with the prisoner, hoped\r\nwith him, and followed all the details of the story, exhibiting the most\r\nprofound pity for the occurrence. Signora Rovero sympathized with her\r\ndaughter, and, for the time, Monte-Leone was the hero of the villa. All\r\nthe prejudices of Aminta disappeared in a moment in the presence of\r\nMonte-Leone, as the morning vapors are dispersed by the first rays of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nMaulear, in icy silence, listened to the Count and looked at Aminta. As\r\nhe did so, his brow became covered with clouds precisely as that of\r\nAminta began to grow bright. The latter, perceiving the painful\r\nimpressions of the Marquis, extended every attention to him, so that\r\nMonte-Leone began to grow moody. The two rivals passed the whole day in\r\nalternations of hope and fear, happiness and suffering. The state of\r\nthings, however, was too tense to be of long duration. These few hours\r\nseemed centuries to the adorers of Aminta, and if any one had been able\r\nto look into the depths of their ulcerated hearts, he would have seen\r\nthat a spark would have produced an explosion. Many of the neighbors of\r\nSignora Rovero, who had not visited her since the ball, ventured to\r\nreturn. Among others present was Gaetano Brignoli. All loved him for his\r\nfrank and pleasant off-hand speeches, and all received him with good\r\nhumor and confidence. Maulear, who had laid aside his dislike, received\r\nhim kindly, as he had previously done distantly. The _Rose of Sorrento_\r\nreproached Gaetano with having forgotten his promise.\r\n\r\n\"You should yourself on the next day,\" said she, \"have given me news of\r\nTaddeo and of Monte-Leone's trial. You, however, only wrote. Friends\r\nlike you, and brothers like mine, are unworthy of the affection bestowed\r\non them.\" Then, like a child _making friends_ with a playmate, she took\r\nGaetano into the embrasure of a meadow, and began to talk with him in a\r\nlow tone. The night promised to be brilliant and serene, and the air to\r\nbe soft and pleasant. The evening breeze penetrated into the saloon,\r\nrefreshing the atmosphere with the respiration of the sea. \"What a\r\nmagnificent evening, Marquis,\" said Monte-Leone to Maulear, as he\r\napproached him, and looked at the stars which had begun to dot the sky.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time the Count had spoken to the Marquis directly. The\r\nlatter trembled as a soldier who hears the sound of the first battle\r\nsignal. His emotion was short, and saluting the Count affably as\r\npossible, he replied:\r\n\r\n\"It, is a winter evening in Italy, Count, but in France it would be one\r\nof summer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you not think,\" said Monte-Leone, \"that this is the proper hour for\r\nexercise, in this country? The complete repose of nature, the eloquent\r\nsilence of night, all invite us to confidence, and make us wish for\r\nisolation and solitude--\"\r\n\r\n\"Count,\" said Maulear, \"do you wish for a half solitude; a desert\r\ninhabited by two persons?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, that is what I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I, and would participate in yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, then, I never saw a more beautiful night, and I shall be charmed\r\nto enjoy it with you.\"\r\n\r\nThese two men, with rage in their hearts, each being an impregnable\r\nbarrier to the happiness of the other, loving the same woman in the same\r\nway, resolved to contend for her, to their last breath;--these two men\r\nleft the saloon, with smiles on their lips, like friends about to listen\r\nto the secret thoughts of each other beneath the shadow of some\r\nbeautiful landscape, in happiness and pleasure.\r\n\r\nAminta saw them go out. She grew pale, and suffered so that she leaned\r\nagainst the window-case.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THREE RIVALS.\r\n\r\nCount Monte-Leone and the Marquis de Maulear entered together a vast and\r\nbeautiful avenue, silvered over by a brilliant moon.\r\n\r\n\"Signor,\" said the Count to Maulear, \"do you ever have waking dreams?\r\nCan you, by the power of your imagination, transport yourself into the\r\nfuture, and, as it were, read your destiny, with all its prosperous and\r\nunfortunate incidents, its pleasures and chagrins? This often happens to\r\nme, especially by day and when I am unhappy. For a long time, too, I\r\nhave been unhappy. For instance, not long ago, when shut up in a dark\r\nprison, with no prospect before me but that of an unjust death, and the\r\nheadsman's axe bringing to a close my sad and eventful career, my good\r\nangel certainly, for I believe in such beings, sent, two hundred feet\r\nbelow the surface of the earth, a vision of dazzling light and beauty. I\r\nwas transported beneath the green shadows of myrtles and orange-trees; I\r\nbreathed an atmosphere impregnated with intoxicating and balsamic\r\nperfumes, while near me, with her hand in mine, and her heart beating on\r\nmy bosom, was a young girl, destined to be my guide through this life of\r\nmisery; the angel, in fact, of whom I spoke just now. Sorrows,\r\nsuffering, injustice, the dungeon, and the executioner, all disappeared,\r\nand I enjoyed all the luxury of this heavenly revelation; and I said,\r\nfor the realization of this heavenly revelation, the heart's blood would\r\nnot be too dear a price. Do you not think so, Marquis?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do, Count,\" said Maulear, \"and especially so, because what your rich\r\nimagination has created for you, chance, or my good genius--for I too\r\nhave faith in them--has displayed before me, not in the delirium of a\r\ndream, but in reality. I have seen the myrtle groves of which you\r\ndreamed: I have breathed the perfumes you describe so well: I have found\r\nthe woman your imagination has shadowed to me. I found her one day when\r\nI did not expect to do so. I found one more beautiful than I had fancied\r\nwoman could be, gifted with such charms, grace, and virtue, that I ask\r\nmyself frequently whether such a being can belong to earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Marquis,\" said Monte-Leone, and as he spoke he led the Count towards a\r\ndarker alley, lighted up only by a few rays of the moon, which\r\npenetrated the interstices of the branches, \"would it not be best to\r\nconclude this conversation rather in the dark than in the light? Our\r\nwords need not any light, and neither you nor I pay any attention to the\r\nexpression of our faces.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it,\" said Maulear, and they entered the dark alley.\r\n\r\n\"Marquis,\" said Monte-Leone, \"the divinity of my dream and the object of\r\nyour passion are so alike, that I am sure we worship the same idol, and\r\nkneel before the same altar. Fortune has led two men of soul and honor\r\ninto the same route. We both struggle for an object which one only can\r\nreach. One of us must tread on a carcass, which must be either yours or\r\nmine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Count,\" said Maulear, \"we understand each other. We adore the same\r\nidol, but you are not ignorant that our rights to offer it homage are\r\ndifferent; that I have rights which you have not.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count trembled. A word might crush all his hopes. For a few moments\r\nhe hesitated, and then in a calm voice said,\r\n\r\n\"Does she love you?\"\r\n\r\nWithout replying to the question, the Marquis said,\r\n\r\n\"Signora Rovero, for her name is too deeply engraven on our hearts for\r\nit not to spring to our lips, is aware of my sentiments, of which I have\r\nalready told her.\"\r\n\r\n\"And has accepted them?\" said Monte-Leone, in yet greater trouble.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Marquis, honorably; \"but bade me hope that some day she\r\nwould.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the Count, with joy, \"nothing is lost. Marquis, the past is\r\nyours, but the future is mine. Had I the mind and grace of a French\r\nnobleman, I would, perhaps, propose to you a contest of courtesy, and\r\nmight rely on my hope, my love, my attention, to triumph. But the\r\ncontest must be of a different kind; for I will expose myself to no\r\nrisks.\" Lowering his voice, he continued: \"Not one and the other can\r\npresent his love to the Signorina Rovero, but _one without the other_.\r\nYou or I alone; and, as I told you just now, there is a life too many.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, signor,--you wage your life against mine. I consent,--but\r\nmust observe that this duel should, at least, accrue to the interest of\r\none or the other of us; and yet I do not think that Signorina Rovero\r\nwould touch a blood-stained hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Signor,\" said Monte-Leone, \"from the moment you accept my challenge,\r\nthe mystery and secrecy with which it must be shrouded shall be my\r\naffair; and, if you please, I will tell you of my plans.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do so, signor,\" said Maulear, coldly.\r\n\r\n\"Let us leave this alley, and go towards that group of trees in that\r\ndirection.\"\r\n\r\nHe led Maulear towards the sea. When they stood on the shore, he said,\r\n\"Below there is a kind of cove, and in it a gondola like those of\r\nVenice--a pleasure-skiff--built formerly by the minister Rovero for his\r\nfamily. At this hour to-morrow, we will meet in this wood and go to the\r\nboat-house. We will then put to sea, and with no witness but the sea and\r\nsky, we will settle our affair. Two men will steer the bark to sea, and\r\none wilt guide it back----\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of his courage, Maulear could not but shudder at one who\r\ndetailed with such coolness so horrible a plan. The manner of death\r\nfrequently enhances our terror, and he who in a forest would bare his\r\nbosom to his adversary's ball, would shrink from it on the immensity of\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Maulear, \"is all this romantic preparation, is this naval\r\ndrama in which you insist on appearing, necessary to our purpose? Any\r\nother secret encounter would have the same effect, and would eventuate\r\nequally satisfactorily. At the distance of a few days' travel, would we\r\nnot be able to fight more safely than here?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Marquis, I must remain in this villa until Taddeo de Sorrento shall\r\nhave returned. Neither I nor you can leave it without arousing\r\nsuspicions, and in two days hence, we would no longer be equals; for\r\nhonor compels me to say that Taddeo has promised me his sister's hand,\r\nand that the influence he exerts over his mother will without doubt\r\ninduce her to decide in my favor. If, however, you prefer to run that\r\nrisk, I will not oppose you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No no,\" said Maulear, who remembered what Taddeo had said to him in\r\nrelation to his sister, \"I will fight for her I love at the very foot of\r\nthe altar--\"\r\n\r\n\"Signor,\" said Monte-Leone, \"let us avoid all scandal. The death of him\r\nwho falls may be easily accounted for; and as you said, we must never\r\nsuffer her we love to think that the happiness of one of us has cost the\r\nother his life.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it,\" said Maulear, \"I accept your offer.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow we will meet,\" said the Count.\r\n\r\nThe two enemies returned to the villa calm, and apparently undisturbed,\r\nas if they had been the best friends possible. When they came into the\r\nroom again, Aminta sat by her mother. The eyes of the young girl,\r\nhowever, turning constantly towards the door, seemed to expect the\r\nreturn of the two young men with anxiety. Her cheeks became slightly\r\nflushed when they entered. The Count approached her and besought her to\r\nsing as he had often heard her. Aminta sat at the piano. Scarcely,\r\nhowever, had she sung the first bar, than the door of the saloon opened\r\nand Scorpione glided in and sat at the feet of the young girl, where he\r\nlaid down as he used to do; not, however, daring to look at her. Since\r\nthe scandal he had caused, he had been in disgrace with all the family,\r\nand his mistress did not speak to him. The Count, who had become\r\nacquainted with Tonio during his first visit to Sorrento, could not\r\nrepress a movement of horror at the appearance of the wretch. Far,\r\nhowever, from being angry, Tonio seemed glad to see him, and testified\r\nhis pleasure by various affectionate signs. Gaetano, who was absent from\r\nthe room, just then returned, and at the request of Signora Rovero sang\r\nseveral duets with Aminta. An extraordinary feeling seemed to influence\r\nthe young man, and only with the greatest difficulty could he get\r\nthrough his part. When the evening was over, all retired. The next day\r\nrolled by in embarrassing constraint to all the inhabitants of the\r\nvilla. An atmosphere of sadness surrounded them, like the dark clouds\r\nwhich seem at the approach of a storm to overhang the earth. Count\r\nMonte-Leone alone seemed master of himself, and sought to cure the\r\ngeneral _atony_ in which even Maulear was involved. A sensible\r\ndifference was remarked between the two men, each of whom loved the same\r\nwoman, while one of them must lose her forever. The Count did not take\r\nhis eyes from her, and seemed thus to lay in a provision of pleasure for\r\neternity, which seemed ready to open before him. Maulear, on the other\r\nhand, was sad and pensive, and scarcely dared to lift his eyes to\r\nAminta, fearing, beyond doubt, that he would thus increase his sorrow\r\nand distress, and diminish his courage when the crisis came. As the day\r\nwore on. Aminta, feeling unwell, retired to her room. Signora Rovero,\r\naccustomed to see her daughter have similar attacks, sat to play\r\n_reversis_ with Count Brignoli and two other persons. Monte-Leone and\r\nMaulear exchanged a mysterious sign and left the room nearly at the same\r\ntime. The night was not so beautiful as the preceding one had been. The\r\ndisk of the moon sometimes was clouded, and the wind whistled among the\r\ntrees of the park; all nature, deeply agitated, seemed to sympathize\r\nwith the thoughts which agitated the minds of the two enemies. The dark\r\nand cloudy sky was a meet back-ground for such a picture.\r\n\r\nNine o'clock was struck by the bell of the Church at Sorrento, when two\r\nmen met at the cove we have described. One of them wrapped in a cloak\r\nhad a case under his arm. They went towards the bank and found the\r\ngondola there. This boat was long, like those of Venice, in imitation of\r\nwhich it had been made--had a little cabin in its stern, which now was\r\nclosed. In it the ladies used to take refuge when bad weather interfered\r\nwith their pleasure. The two men used all their strength to detach the\r\ngondola from the shore. At last they succeeded. The most robust then\r\ntook one of the oars and pushed the boat from the bank. Just as they\r\nwere about to put off, a burst of demoniac laughter rung in their ears.\r\nA very demon, a breathing spirit of evil, had witnessed all their\r\npreparations, and had learned, from its shape, the contents of the box;\r\nthe idea of what they meditated caused him to utter this shout of\r\nlaughter. This demon was Scorpione. This deformity was the rival of\r\nMonte-Leone and Maulear.\r\n\r\nThe blue and azure waves of the sea of Naples on that night seemed dark\r\nas ink. The wind agitated them. Calm as they usually are, and like a\r\nvast cemetery, the tombs of which open to receive the dead, they opened\r\nbefore the prow of the boat like a grave, as they were intended to be.\r\nAt a distance of about three hundred fathoms the two adversaries ceased\r\nto row and replaced the oars in the gondola. Without speaking, they took\r\nout the pistols, examined their locks, and opened them.\r\n\r\n\"Signor,\" said Monte-Leone, \"I thank you for the honor you have done me\r\nin deigning to use my arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"The arms of Count Monte-Leone are not to be refused.\"\r\n\r\n\"A true hand gives them.\"\r\n\r\n\"A true hand receives them.\"\r\n\r\nNothing more was said. They then proceeded to place themselves at the\r\nseveral ends of the boat. The Count uncovered himself. Maulear did also.\r\nThey let fall their cloaks and opened the linen which covered their\r\nbosoms. They raised their pistols, took aim, and were about to fire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe door of the cabin was thrown open, and Aminta rushed to the centre\r\nof the gondola. Gaetano followed her. The weapons fell from the hands of\r\nthe rivals; and in terror and surprise they looked on this apparition.\r\nNot a cry escaped from their lips. Pale and motionless, they looked at\r\neach other without, at first, recognizing Aminta. Not a word passed\r\ntheir lips. Terror-stricken, they fancied themselves in the presence of\r\nsome heavenly being, sent, like the angel of peace, to rescue them from\r\ndeath. The voice of Aminta, full of trouble and terror, echoed over the\r\nwaves, like that of an angel, and alone aroused them from the ecstatic\r\nstate in which they were plunged.\r\n\r\n\"Signori,\" said she, \"I might sooner have put a stop to this atrocious\r\nduel, the very idea of which terrifies me; had it not have been so near\r\nits completion, you would, perhaps, have denied the intention to fight\r\nafter all, within a few days. Thanks to the assistance of Gaetano, my\r\nchildhood's friend, who yesterday evening became acquainted with your\r\nintention, I have by God's aid been able to prevent it. I wished my\r\npresence to be grave and solemn, that you might never renew the attempt;\r\nin order that, as it were, in the presence of God and of death, you\r\nmight know my fixed determination. I would not be burdened with an\r\nexistence which had cost the life of a fellow-being: you, Signor\r\nMonte-Leone, by the revered manes of your father; and you, Marquis de\r\nMaulear, by all you love, I conjure to swear that you will respect the\r\nlife of him I shall accept as my husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impose no such oath on me,\" said Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\n\"Let me die first,\" said Maulear.\r\n\r\n\"Not you only, but I will die also. If I do not hear you swear, I will\r\nthrow myself into the sea.\"\r\n\r\nShe placed her foot on the gunwale of the boat.\r\n\r\n\"We swear,\" said the rivals, rushing towards her.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Signori, I will trust your oath. Count Monte-Leone,\" said she,\r\n\"the Marquis de Maulear saved my life; you will also learn, hereafter,\r\nhow generously he resolved to save my honor when it was compromised. My\r\nheart is de Maulear's, and I give him my hand.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marquis fell at Aminta's feet.\r\n\r\n\"To you,\" she continued, \"Count Monte-Leone, I can offer only my respect\r\nand esteem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Signorina,\" said Monte-Leone, with a voice full of dignity and despair,\r\n\"I accept even the boon you offer me; and henceforth he whom you love is\r\nsacred to me.\"\r\n\r\nBy a violent effort over himself he extended his hand to Maulear. The\r\nwaves had borne the bark towards the shore, and all who had participated\r\nin this scene returned safely to the villa. Signora Rovero, who did not\r\nknow what had passed, on the next day received a letter from\r\nMonte-Leone, who, during the night, had left the villa.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\nNothing can describe the intensity of Count Monte-Leone's grief when he\r\nwas again in the carriage, which, on the evening before, had borne him\r\nto happiness, and now took him back to Naples, sad and despairing. The\r\nCount had overcome his own nature, and this was a great victory to one\r\nwho usually yielded to every prompting of passion. On this occasion he\r\nhad restrained himself and overcome his rage at his rival's triumph. He\r\novercame his agony at the wreck of his hopes. When he left Sorrento, and\r\nawoke, so to say, from the stupefaction into which he had plunged, the\r\nexcitable brain and fiery heart again re-opened.\r\n\r\n\"I was a fool,\" said he, \"I was a fool when I yielded my happiness to\r\nanother. I was yet more mad when I swore to respect his life, when\r\nsomething far more violent than mine is wrested from me. Has he not\r\ncrushed and tortured my heart? I regret even my place of imprisonment,\"\r\ncontinued he. \"There I had dreams of love; and had death reached me in\r\nthat abyss, I should have borne away hopes of the future which now are\r\ncrushed for ever.\"\r\n\r\nTwo torrents of tears rolled down the cheeks of this iron-hearted man,\r\nover which they had rarely flown before.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after Monte-Leone's return to his hotel, he might have\r\nbeen observed sitting before the portrait of the victim of Carlo III.,\r\nthe holy martyr of conscience, as he called his father, looking on his\r\nnoble brow with the most tender respect. We have spoken of the almost\r\nsuperstitious faith of the Count in the fact that his father protected\r\nhim in all the events of his life. We have heard him call on his father\r\nwhen about to be buried in the waves of the sea, and then become\r\nresigned to death in the pious faith that his father waited for him.\r\nWhenever danger menaced Monte-Leone; whenever he was unexpectedly\r\nprosperous, or was involved in misfortune; whenever his life was lighted\r\nup with prosperity, or misfortune overwhelmed him, he always looked to\r\nthis parent. He thought his pure spirit hovered above him; and\r\nencouraged by this celestial aid, he trusted to the mutations of fortune\r\nwithout fear or apprehension. When he looked at this adored image,\r\nconsolation seemed always to descend on his soul. Overcome by the\r\nboundless love Aminta had inspired, he had forgotten the political\r\nduties to which he was devoted. It seemed to him that this cause, to\r\nwhich he had consecrated his life, had wonderfully diminished in\r\nimportance since his trial.\r\n\r\n\"Can it be, oh my father, that you were unwilling for my love to\r\ninterfere with the prospects of the duties imposed on me by your death?\r\nOr, is it that in your pity you have feared that, in my dangers, the\r\nangel to whom I have devoted my existence would be overwhelmed. If, oh\r\nmy father, it be thy will that I suffer these cruel torments; if I am to\r\nreserve my energy for the cause I defend, be rejoiced at my sufferings,\r\nfor I am able to bear them. Ere long I will again see those who have\r\ntrusted me with their fate, and the suspicions of whom offend and wound\r\nme. They will know my resolutions, and I shall know whether I shall\r\nremain their leader or tread my weary way alone.\"\r\n\r\nJust then the door of his cabinet opened, and a man appeared, or rather\r\na spectre, so much had his appearance been changed by fatigue and\r\nsuffering. He rushed into the arms of Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\n\"Taddeo,\" said he, \"my God! what has happened? How pale you are! Why are\r\nthese tears in your eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend, La Felina has deceived me only by a day. She was, however,\r\nmistaken herself. To-morrow, said she, you will _love me less_. To-day I\r\nlove her no more. You see I have done better than she even hoped.\"\r\n\r\nHe fell, with his heart crushed, on a chair, and sobbed.\r\n\r\n\"Speak, speak to me,\" said Monte-Leone, forgetful of his friend's\r\nsuffering in his own.\r\n\r\n\"As I wrote to you,\" said Taddeo, \"I determined to follow her, and find\r\nout her retreat at all events. Had it been necessary, I would have\r\nfollowed her to the end of the world. Leaving the horse I had in a\r\nstreet near the theatre, I went to the door whence I supposed La Felina\r\nwould come. I had been there an hour when I saw a post-carriage\r\napproach. A few moments had elapsed when a woman, accompanied by a\r\nservant, left the theatre, and after looking anxiously around, to be\r\nsure that she was unobserved, entered the carriage. The valet got up\r\nbehind, and the postillion, who had not left the saddle, whipped up his\r\nhorses and left in a gallop. I mounted my horse and followed the\r\ncarriage, keeping just two hundred yards behind it. The carriage was\r\ndriven towards Rome, and at every post-house the horses were changed, on\r\nwhich occasions I kept out of sight, and then resumed my pursuit. Thus\r\nwe travelled about fifteen leagues; when, however, we reached the eighth\r\npost-house, the carriage spring became broken and the body was thrown\r\ninto a ditch. I rushed towards it, opened the door, and, in a fainting\r\ncondition, received the person it contained. I bore her to the road,\r\nand, to give her air, threw aside her veil. I uttered a cry of rage and\r\nagony. The woman in my arms was not La Felina. The sound of my voice\r\naroused the stranger's attention, and she looked at me as if she were\r\nafraid. 'Who are you?' said she, trembling. 'What do you wish?' 'To save\r\nLa Felina, whom I thought was here.' 'La Felina! You were in search of\r\nLa Felina!' 'Certainly.' 'And you are the horseman whom Giuseppe, the\r\ncourier, told me at the last relay, followed us, are you?' 'Certainly I\r\nam.' The woman examined her arms, etc., to see that she was not hurt,\r\nlooked at me most ironically, and then bursting into laughter, said:\r\n'Well, after all, the trick was well played.' 'What trick?' 'The one La\r\nFelina has played on all her lovers, the most ardent of whom you are.' I\r\nlooked at the woman so earnestly, and sorrow seemed so deeply marked on\r\nmy countenance, that I saw an expression of pity steal over her face.\r\n'Poor young man!' said she, 'then you really loved her?' 'I did, and if\r\nI lose her I shall die.' 'Come,' said she, 'you will not die. If all who\r\nhave told me the same thing died, Naples would be like the catacombs of\r\nRome. Come with me,' she continued, 'to the post-house, for now I feel\r\nby the pain I suffer that my arm is out of place. There I will tell you\r\nall.' I went with the woman to the post-house, when a few drops of\r\ncordial soon invigorated her. 'This is the explanation of what is a\r\nmatter of so much surprise to you. Perhaps I should be silent; but you\r\nseem to love La Felina so truly, and a young man who really loves is so\r\ninteresting that I will tell you all.' The circumlocution of this woman\r\nalmost ran me mad! She finally said: 'My mistress was afraid some of her\r\nlovers would follow her, and wishing to conceal the route she had gone,\r\ntook the idea of substituting me for herself, and sent me to Rome, where\r\nshe is to write me her destination. You followed me instead of her. She\r\nwas right, and had good reason to act as she did.' 'Then she has not yet\r\nleft,' asked I, thinking of a means to rejoin her. 'She was to leave\r\nNaples,' said the woman, 'an hour after me, and is, no doubt, now far\r\nfrom the city.' 'And does she travel alone on these dangerous roads?'\r\nsaid I. 'Oh, no, she travels with him.' 'With him! of whom, for heaven's\r\nsake, do you speak?' 'Ah,' said the woman, 'La Felina would never\r\nforgive me if I told you. He, too, might make me pay dearly for my\r\nindiscretion.' I begged, I besought the woman to conceal nothing from\r\nme, and gave her all the money I had, promising to increase the sum\r\ntenfold. She yielded at last, and told me that _La Felina_ had left\r\nNaples with her lover. Her lover! do you hear?\" continued Taddeo, in a\r\ndelirium of rage, \"and her lover is the minister of police, the Duke of\r\nPalma.\"\r\n\r\n\"More perfidious than the water!\" said Monte-Leone, contemptuously.\r\n\"Poor Taddeo!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not pity me,\" said the latter, in a paroxysm of terrible rage. \"I\r\nwas to be pitied when I loved her, when a divinity dwelt in my soul,\r\nwhen my love was ecstatic and endowed her with an innocence, which my\r\nreason told me she did not possess. I was fool enough to deceive myself.\r\nNow this woman to be sure is but a woman; she is less than feminine, as\r\nthe mistress of a rich and powerful noble, the Duke of Palmo. Love might\r\nhave killed me, but contempt has stifled love.\"\r\n\r\nHis head fell on his chest, and he wept. He wept as man weeps for a\r\ndeparted passion, which has vivified his heart, but which yields to\r\ndeath, or worse still, another passion.\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" said Monte-Leone, \"your grief is cruel, but I suffer more\r\nintensely!\" Monte-Leone told Taddeo what had taken place at Sorrento.\r\n\r\nThe friends were again locked in the arms of each other, and mingled\r\ntheir tears--the one for the loss of an _earthly passion_, and the other\r\nfor a _celestial affection_, as Monte-Leone characterized the two\r\nsentiments when he read a letter of Rovero's. Taddeo had appointed the\r\nfollowing day for his return to Sorrento, and faithful to his promise he\r\nleft Naples for the villa of his mother. The farewell of the two men was\r\nsad and touching, for a long time must elapse before they met again.\r\nMonte-Leone had resolved to leave Naples for some time. The proximity of\r\nSorrento lacerated his heart, and to see her he loved the wife of\r\nanother would to him be insupportable. Taddeo was aware of the reasons\r\nwhy the Count had determined to travel, and had he no mother he would\r\nalso have been anxious to leave the country.\r\n\r\n\"Taddeo,\" said Monte-Leone to his friend, when the former was about to\r\nset out, \"I have a favor to ask of you on which I place an immense\r\nestimate, and for which I must be indebted to your love. Here,\" said he,\r\npresenting the magnificent emerald wrought by Benvenuto Cellini, \"take\r\nthis ring, and beg your sister to accept it. Tell her, as she offered me\r\nher friendship, I have a right to send a testimonial to her of my\r\ndevotion.\" Then with a voice trembling with emotion, he added, \"Say this\r\nring preserved my life. This will not add to its value in her eyes; but\r\ntell her in confidence the history of this ring, and some day,\" said he,\r\nwith a bitter smile, \"it may be looked on as a curious relic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so, not so,\" said Taddeo, kissing the ring. \"To us it cannot but be\r\na precious treasure.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps while he acted thus, Taddeo thought not only of his friend, but\r\nof the woman who had preserved him from death.\r\n\r\nTaddeo left.\r\n\r\nFifteen days after his reaching home, all Sorrento put on its holiday\r\nattire. The church of the town, splendidly decorated, the lighted\r\ntorches, the people in their gala dresses, all announced that some\r\nremarkable event was about to take place in the village. The bells rung\r\nloud peals, and young girls dressed in white, with flowers in their\r\nhands, stood on the church portico. Certainly a great event was about to\r\ntake place. The _White Rose of Sorrento_ was about to be married to a\r\nFrench nobleman of high rank, _Henri Marquis de Maulear_.\r\n\r\nAbout noon there was a rumor among the crowd in front of the church that\r\nthe bridal party were near. All hurried to meet them, and Aminta was\r\nseen leaning on her brother's arm, while the Marquis escorted Signora\r\nRovero.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the beautiful young girl, whiter than her veil, paler\r\nthan the flowers which adorned her brow, produced a general sensation of\r\nadmiration. Mingled with this, however, was a kind of sadness, when the\r\nmelancholy on her brow was observed. The Marquis seemed also to be ill\r\nat ease, and to suffer under the influence of feelings which on such a\r\nday were strange indeed. All care, all anxiety should be lost in the\r\nintoxication of love. Maulear had purchased his happiness by an error,\r\nand this oppressed him. After the noble decision of Aminta, and the\r\npreference she had so heroically expressed at the time of his purposed\r\nduel with Monte-Leone, Maulear had not dared to mention the letter of\r\nhis father. He had simply told Signora Rovero, that he was master of his\r\nown actions, and sure of his father's consent and approbation to the\r\nmarriage he was about to contract. The Signora, who was credulous, was\r\nconfident that a brilliant match was secured for Aminta, and suffered\r\nherself to be easily persuaded. Maulear, too, became daily more\r\ninfatuated; and, listening to passion alone, had informed his father,\r\nnot that he was about to marry, but that when the letter reached him he\r\nwould be married. Yet when he had sent the letter, and the time was\r\ncome, all his fears were aroused, and he shuddered at the apprehension\r\nof the consequences of what he was about to do. In this state of mind he\r\nwent to the altar, and nothing but the beauty of his bride and the\r\nsolemnity of the ceremony could efface the sombre clouds which obscured\r\nhis brow. The priest blessed the pair, and a few minutes after the young\r\nMarquis of Maulear, with his beautiful _Marquise_, left the village.\r\n\r\nJust when the venerable village priest, in God's name, placed Aminta's\r\nhand in Henri's, the terrible cry we have already heard twice echoed\r\nthrough the arches of the church, and a man was seen to rush towards the\r\nsea. The shout, though it filled the church, was uttered in the portico,\r\nand had not interrupted the service. Thenceforth _Scorpione_ was never\r\nseen at Sorrento.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[N] Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1850, by Stringer\r\n& Townsend, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United\r\nStates for the Southern District of New York.\r\n\r\n[O] _Anglice._ Good day, my dear Pignana.\r\n\r\n[P] The original of this sentence is _Je vais vous donner la liste ...\r\nc'est a dire le compte de_ NOS HOMMES ... _non de_ NOS SOMMES, _etc.,\r\netc._ It is scarcely probably that MONTE-LEONE and Pignana, speaking\r\nItalian, indulged in French _jeux des mots_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ABBE DE VOISENON AND HIS TIMES.\r\n\r\nFrom Frazer's Magazine\r\n\r\n\r\nThe province of Brie, in France, divided and subdivided since the\r\nRevolution of 1789, into departments, arondissements, and cantons, is\r\nfilled with chateaux, which, in the reign of Louis XV., were inhabited\r\nby those gold-be-spangled marquises, those idle, godless abbes, and\r\nthose obese financiers, whom the secret memoirs of Grimm and Bachaumont,\r\nand the letters of the Marquis de Lauraguais, have held up to such\r\nunsparing ridicule and contempt. This milky and cheese-producing Brie,\r\nthis inexhaustible Io, was, at the epoch of the regent Orleans and his\r\ndeplorable successor, a literal cavern of pleasures, in the most impure\r\nacceptation of the term; every chateau which the Black Band has not\r\ndemolished is, as it were, a half-volume of memoirs in which may be read\r\nthe entire history of the times. Here is the spot where formerly stood\r\nthe chateau of Samuel Bernard, the prodigal, it is true, of an anterior\r\nage, but worthy of the succeeding one; there is the pavilion of Bourei,\r\nanother financier, another Jupiter of all the Danaes of the Theatre\r\nItalien: on this side we see Vaux, the residence of that most princely\r\nof finance ministers, whose suddenly acquired power and wealth, and as\r\nsudden downfall, may surely point a moral for all ministers present and\r\nto come; on that side we have the chateau of Law, the trigonometrical\r\nthief; and Brunoy, the residence of the greatest eccentric perhaps in\r\nthe annals of French history: in a word, wherever the foot is placed,\r\nthere arises a sort of lamentation of the eighteenth century--that\r\ncelebrated century, whose limits we do not pretend to circumscribe as\r\nthe astronomers would, but whose beginning may be dated from the decline\r\nof the reign of Louis XIV., its career closing with Barras, whose\r\nimmodest chateau still displays at the present day its restored\r\nfoundations on the soil upon which Vaux, Brunoy, and Voisenon, shone so\r\nfatally.\r\n\r\nIt was in this last named little chateau that was born and educated the\r\ncelebrated abbe, the friend of Voltaire, of Madame Favart, and of the\r\nDuc de la Valliere; and here it was, also, that in manhood its possessor\r\nwould occasionally resort, though not the least in the world a man who\r\ncould appreciate rural enjoyments, for the purpose of reposing from the\r\nfatigues of some of his epicurean pilgrimages to his friends at Paris or\r\nMontrouge, and which was his final sojourn when age and infirmities\r\nrendered it imperatively necessary for him to breathe the pure air of\r\nhis native place, far away from the heating _petits soupers_ of the\r\ncapital, and the various other dearly cherished scenes of his earlier\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nClaude Henri Fusee de Voisenon, Abbe of Jard, and Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary of the Prince-Bishop of Spire, was born at Voisenon on\r\nthe 8th of June, 1708. Biographers have, perhaps, laid too much stress\r\non the debility of constitution which he brought with him into the\r\nworld, inherited, they say, from his mother, an exceedingly delicate\r\nwoman. Since the examples of longevity given by Fontenelle and Voltaire,\r\nof whom the first lived to the use of a hundred, and the second to\r\nupwards of four-score years, and yet both of whom came into the world\r\nwith very doubtful chances of existence, it is become a very hazardous\r\ntask to determine, or even to foretell, length of days by the state of\r\nhealth at birth. They add, that an unhealthy nurse, aggravating the\r\nhereditary weakness of the child, infused with her milk into his blood\r\nthe germs of that asthma from which he suffered all his life, and of\r\nwhich he eventually died. These facts accepted--a delicate mother, an\r\nunhealthy nurse, an asthma, and constant spittings of blood--it follows\r\nthat, even with these serious disadvantages to contend with, a man may\r\nlive and even enjoy life up to the age of sixty-eight. How many healthy\r\nmen there are who would be content to attain this age! And if the Abbe\r\nde Voisenon did not exceed the bounds of an age of very fair\r\nproportions, we must bear in mind that, though even an invalid, he\r\nconstantly trifled with his health with the imprudence of a man of\r\nvigorous constitution; eating beyond measure, drinking freely, presiding\r\nat all the _petits soupers_--_petit_ only in name--of the capital,\r\npassing the nights in running from _salon_ to _salon_, and seldom\r\nretiring to rest before morning: a worthy pupil of that Hercules of\r\ndebauchery, Richelieu, his master and his executioner. Terrified at the\r\ndelicate appearance of his child, his father dared not send him to\r\nschool, but had him brought up under his own eye, with all the patience\r\nof an indulgent parent and the solicitude of a physician. Five years'\r\ncares were sufficient to develop the intellectual capacities of a mind\r\nat once lively and clear, and marvellously fitted by nature to receive\r\nand retain the lessons of preceptors. At eleven years of age he\r\naddressed a rhyming epistle to Voltaire, who replied,--\r\n\r\n\"You love verses, and I predict that you will make charming ones. Come\r\nand see me, and be my pupil.\"\r\n\r\nIf Voisenon justified the prediction, he scarcely surpassed the\r\nfavorable sense which it incloses. Verbose, incorrect, poor in form,\r\npale and washy as diluted Indian ink, his verses occasionally display\r\nwitty touches, because every one was witty in the eighteenth century;\r\nbut to class them with the works of the poets of his day as _poetry_ is\r\nimpossible--they merit only being considered in the light of lemonade\r\nmade from Voltaire's well-squeezed lemons.\r\n\r\nIn many respects the prose of the eighteenth century, not being an art,\r\nbut rather the resource of unsuccessful poets, lent itself better than\r\ndid the muse to the idle fantasies of the Abbe de Voisenon. His facetiae,\r\nhis historiettes, his Oriental tales, reunited later (at least in part)\r\nwith the works of the Comte de Caylus, and with the libertine tales of\r\nDuclos and the younger Crebillon, prove the facility with which he could\r\nimitate Voltaire, while his lucubrations must be considered as far\r\ninferior to the short tales of the latter author. For the most part too\r\nfree, too indecent, in short, to show their faces beside some\r\nelaborately serious fragments which form what are called his works, they\r\nfigure in the work we have just named under the title of _Recueil de ces\r\nMessieurs; Aventures des Bals des Bois; Etrennes de la St. Jean; Les\r\nEcosseuses; les Oeufs de Paques_, &c. We know, by the memoirs of the\r\ntime, that a society of men of letters, formed by Mademoiselle Quinaut\r\ndu Frene, and composed of fourteen members chosen by her, had proposed\r\nto itself the high and difficult mission of supping well at stated\r\nintervals, and of being immensely witty and extravagantly gay. At the\r\nend of the half-year these effusions of wit and gayety were printed by\r\nthe society at the mutual expense of its members, and given to the world\r\nunder the title of _Recueil de ces Messieurs_.[Q] Deprived of the\r\nillusive accompaniments of the lights, the sparkling eyes, the tinkling\r\nglasses, and the indulgent good-nature engendered by an excellent\r\ndinner, good wines, and an ample dessert, these table libertinages, when\r\nread nearly a century afterwards, lose all their piquancy of flavor and\r\nbecome simply nauseous. The readings, and consequently the dinners, took\r\nplace sometimes at the house of Mademoiselle Quinaut, sometimes at that\r\nof the Comte de Caylus.\r\n\r\nHaving conceived a disgust for the profession of arms--for which he had\r\nbeen originally intended--in consequence of having fought with and\r\nwounded a young officer in a duel, he determined upon embracing the\r\necclesiastical state; and shortly after taking orders was inducted by\r\nCardinal Fleury to the royal abbey of Jard--an easy government, the seat\r\nof which was his own chateau of Voisenon.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was actually a dignitary of the Church, he turned his\r\nthoughts entirely to the stage! In compliance with the request of\r\nMademoiselle Quinaut, the new Abbe of Jard wrote a series of dramatic\r\npieces, among which may be cited, _La Coquette fixee_, _Le Reveil de\r\nThalie_, _Les Mariages assortis_, and _Le Jeune Grecque_, little\r\ndrawing-room comedies, which have not kept possession of the stage, and\r\nto which French literature knows not where to give a place at the\r\npresent day, so far are they from offering a single recommendable\r\nquality. The only style of composition in which the Abbe de Voisenon\r\nmight have, perhaps, distinguished himself, had he been seconded by an\r\nintelligent musician, was the operatic. In this _baladin_ talent of his\r\nthere was something of the freedom and sparkle of the Italian abbes; and\r\nyet the Abbe de Voisenon enjoyed during his life-time a high degree of\r\ncelebrity. Seeing the utter impossibility of justifying this celebrity\r\nby his works, we must presume that it proceeded chiefly from his amiable\r\ncharacter, his pointed epigrammatical conversation, and in a great\r\nmeasure, also, from his brilliant position in the world. And, after all,\r\ndid celebrity require other causes at a time when a man's success was\r\nestablished, not by the publicity of the press, but from the words\r\ndropped from his lips in the \"world,\" and from the occasional\r\nenunciation of a sparkling _bon mot_ quickly caught up and for a length\r\nof time repeated? Were we to protest against this species of\r\n_illustration_, as the French call it, we should be in the wrong: each\r\nepoch has its own; since then times are altered: now-a-days, in France,\r\na man obtains celebrity through the medium of the press, formerly it was\r\nby the _salons_. In general, the French _litterateurs_, especially the\r\njournalists, may be said to write better now than they did then; but\r\nwhere, we should like to know, is there now to be found a young writer\r\nof thirty capable of creating and sustaining a conversation in a society\r\nconsisting of upwards of a hundred distinguished persons? The lackeys of\r\nM. de Boufflers were, in all probability, more in their place in a\r\n_salon_ than would be the most learned or witty writers of the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIf the Abbe de Voisenon was not exactly an eagle as regards common sense\r\nand intellectual attainments, what are we to think of M. de Choiseul,\r\nwho wished to appoint him minister of France at some foreign court? The\r\nAbbe de Voisenon a minister! that man whom M. de Lauraguais called _a\r\nhandful of fleas_! But if he became not minister of France, it was\r\ndecreed by fate that he should be minister of somebody or other; he was\r\ntoo incapable to escape this honor. Some years after the failure of this\r\nridiculous project of M. de Choiseul, the Prince-bishop of Spire\r\nappointed him his minister plenipotentiary at the Court of France. His\r\nadmission into the bosom of the French Academy was all that was now\r\nrequired to complete his happiness, and this honor was shortly\r\nafterwards conferred upon him, for he was duly elected to the chair\r\nvacated by the death of Crebillon.\r\n\r\nAt the age of fifty-two, with the intention of getting rid of his\r\nasthma, his constant companion through life, he determined to try the\r\neffect of mineral waters upon his enfeebled constitution. His journey\r\nfrom Paris to Cautarets, and his sojourn in this head-quarters of\r\nbitumen and sulphur, as related by himself in his letters to his\r\nfriends, may be considered as an historical portraiture of the method of\r\ntravelling, as pursued by the grandees of the time, as well as being the\r\ntruest pages of the idle, epicurean, pleasure-loving, yet infirm,\r\nexistence of the narrator.\r\n\r\n     \"We passed through Tours yesterday (writes he to his friend\r\n     Favart, in his first letter, dated from Chatelherault the 8th\r\n     day of June, 1761), where Madame la Duchess de Choiseul\r\n     received all the honors due to the _gouvernante_ of the\r\n     province: we entered by the Mall, which is planted with trees\r\n     as beautiful as those of the Parisian Boulevards. Here we found\r\n     a mayor, who came to harangue the duchess. It happened that M.\r\n     Sainfrais, during the harangue, had posted himself directly\r\n     behind the speaker, so that every now and then his horse, which\r\n     kept constantly tossing its head, as horses will do, would give\r\n     him a little tap on the back--a circumstance which cut his\r\n     phrases in half in the most ludicrous manner possible; because\r\n     at every blow the orator would turn round to see what was the\r\n     matter, after which he would gravely resume his discourse,\r\n     while I was ready to burst with laughter the whole time. Two\r\n     leagues further on we had another rich scene; an ecclesiastic\r\n     stopped the carriage, and commenced a pompous harangue\r\n     addressed to M. Poisonnier, whom he kept calling _mon Prince_.\r\n     M. Poisonnier replied, that he was more than a prince, and that\r\n     in fact the lives of all princes depended upon him, for he was\r\n     a physician. 'What!' exclaimed the priest, 'you are not M. le\r\n     Prince de Talmont?' 'He has been dead these two years,' replied\r\n     the Duchesse de Choiseul. 'But who, then, is in this carriage?'\r\n     'It is Madame la Duchesse de Choiseul,' replied some one.\r\n     Forthwith, not a whit disconcerted, he commenced another\r\n     harangue, in which he lauded to the skies the excellent\r\n     education she had bestowed on her son. 'But I have no son,\r\n     monsieur,' replied the duchess quietly. 'Ah! you have no son; I\r\n     am very sorry for that;' and so saying his reverence put his\r\n     harangue in his pocket, and walked off.\r\n\r\n     \"Adieu, my worthy friend. We shall reach Bordeaux on Thursday.\r\n     I intend to feed well when I get there.\"\r\n\r\nWhat an edifying picture of the state of the high and low clergy of\r\nFrance at this epoch is presented to us! The Abbe de Voisenon rolling\r\nalong in his carriage, indulging in the anticipatory delights of some\r\ngood 'feeds' when he shall get to Bordeaux; and a hungry priest\r\nharanguing right and left the first comers who may present themselves,\r\nin order to obtain the wherewithal to procure a dinner.\r\n\r\nIt is to Madame Favart that Voisenon writes from Bordeaux:--\r\n\r\n     \"We arrived here at ten o'clock yesterday evening, and found\r\n     Marshal de Richelieu, who had crossed the Garonne to meet the\r\n     Duchesse de Choiseul. This city is beautiful viewed at a\r\n     distance--all that appertains to the exterior is of the best;\r\n     but what afflicts me most of all, is the sad fact that there\r\n     are no sardines to be had on account of the war. I was not\r\n     aware that the sardines had taken part against; however, I\r\n     revenged myself upon two ortolans, which I devoured for supper,\r\n     along with a _pate_ of red partridges _aux truffes_, which,\r\n     though made as long back as November last--as Marshal de\r\n     Richelieu assured me--was as fresh and as _parfume_ as if it\r\n     had been made but the night before.\"\r\n\r\nIf the reader should feel astonished that an asthmatical patient could\r\neat partridges and truffles without being horribly ill, his astonishment\r\nwill not be of long continuance. The following day Voisenon wrote to\r\nFavart:--\r\n\r\n     \"Oh, my dear friend, I have passed a frightful night. I was\r\n     obliged to smoke and take my _kermes_. I shall not be able to\r\n     see any of the 'lions' of the place. If I am three days\r\n     following in this state after I get to Cauterets, you will have\r\n     me back again with you by the end of the month.\"\r\n\r\nOne would suppose that after this gentle hint our abbe would be more\r\nprudent; not a bit of it. In the same letter he adds:--\r\n\r\n     \"The dinner-table yesterday was covered with sardines. At the\r\n     very first start I eat six in as many mouthfuls--a truly\r\n     delicious _morceau_; despite my _kermes_, I reckon upon eating\r\n     as many to-day, along with my two ortolans. We leave to-morrow,\r\n     and on Wednesday we shall reach Cauterets.\"\r\n\r\nThus, ill on the 11th in consequence of a monstrous supper taken on the\r\n10th, we find him, for all that, on the following day devouring sardines\r\nby the half-dozen, and ortolans again! On the 18th he writes from\r\nCauterets to his friend Favart:--\r\n\r\n     \"I arrived yesterday in good health, but have slept badly,\r\n     because the house in which I lodge is situated over a torrent,\r\n     which makes a frightful noise. This country I can only compare\r\n     to an icy horror, like the tragedy of _Teree_.\"\r\n\r\nTwelve days afterwards, Voisenon writes to Madame Favart:--\r\n\r\n     \"Madame de Choiseul's uncle, who paid you so many compliments\r\n     in the green-room, arrived yesterday: he lodges in the same\r\n     house with me.... I introduced him this morning into one of the\r\n     best houses in Cauterets--indeed the very best house--where, I\r\n     must confess, I myself spend three parts of the entire day; in\r\n     a word, it is the pastry-cook's. This learned individual\r\n     compounds admirable tartlets, as well as some little cakes of\r\n     singular lightness; but above all, certain delicious little\r\n     puffs composed of cream and millet-flour, which he calls\r\n     _millassons_. I stuff them all day long. This makes the waters\r\n     turn sour on my stomach, and myself turn very yellow; but I am\r\n     tolerably well notwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\nThis gormandizing Abbe de Voisenon, ever hanging, as it were, between\r\n_pates_ and his grave, becomes now a rather interesting subject of\r\nstudy. We begin to speculate upon what it is that will finally carry him\r\noff: his asthma, or the confectionary he daily swallows.\r\n\r\nHe writes to Favart:--\r\n\r\n     \"I bathe every morning, and during this operation I bear a\r\n     striking resemblance to a match dipped in sulphur. I keep my\r\n     health, however, tolerably well, though still suffering from my\r\n     asthma, of which I fear I shall never be cured.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be a wonder if he should be cured, with his unfortunate table\r\nexcesses, which would have killed half-a-dozen healthy men. In vain do\r\nwe seek in his correspondence with Favart and his wife, a single thought\r\nunconnected with the pleasures of the stomach. We have read with what\r\ndelight he sings the praises of a pastry-cook established at Cauterets,\r\nfamous for his millet-cakes and cream-puffs. His happiness did not stop\r\nhere:--\r\n\r\n\"A second pastry-cook (he cries), upon my reputation, has set up here.\r\nThere is a daily trial of skill between the two artists; I eat and\r\njudge, and it is my stomach that pays the cost. I go to the bath, and\r\nreturn to the oven. I shall come here again in the thrush season. We\r\nhave red partridges, which are brought here from all parts; they are\r\ndelicious.\"\r\n\r\nIn short, he remained so long stuffing confectionary at Cauterets, where\r\nhe had gone solely to take care of himself, and to live with the\r\nstrictest regularity, that on the eve of his departure he wrote sadly to\r\nMadame Favart:--'I am just the same as when you saw me last: sometimes\r\nasthmatical, and always gormandizing.' The sufferings which he\r\nexperienced during his sojourn at, Bareges, previous to his final return\r\nto Paris, are proofs of the deplorable effects of the mineral waters\r\nupon his health:--\r\n\r\n     \"I am suffering dreadfully; and am now, while I write, laboring\r\n     under so violent an attack of asthma, that I cannot doubt but\r\n     that the air of this country is as bad for me as that of\r\n     Montrouge. If I am as bad to-morrow, I shall return to pass the\r\n     week at Cauterets, and on Saturday go on to Pau, where I shall\r\n     wait for the ladies who are to pass through on Monday, on their\r\n     way to Bayonne. I know I shall be in a miserable state during\r\n     the journey.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the benefits derived by the Abbe de Voisenon from his four\r\nmonths' sojourn at the baths of Cauterets and Bareges. He returned to\r\nVoisenon infinitely worse than when he left it. On the eve of his\r\ndeparture for home, where, as he said some time afterwards, he wished\r\n_to be on the same floor with the tombs of his ancestors_, he devoured a\r\nmonstrous dinner on the Bareges mountains.\r\n\r\nFinding that the mineral waters of the Pyrenees had failed in\r\nreestablishing his health--that is, if he ever had health--the Abbe de\r\nVoisenon abandoned physicians and their fruitless prescriptions, to seek\r\nelsewhere remedies for the cure of his asthma, which became more and\r\nmore troublesome as he began to get into years. As he was constantly\r\nspeaking of his disease to everybody, and as everybody--at least all\r\nthose who wished to get into his good graces--spoke of it to him, he\r\nlearned one day that there existed in some garret of Paris a certain\r\nabbe deeply learned in all the mysteries of occult chemistry, an adept\r\nof the great Albert, the master of masters in empirical art. Like all\r\nsorcerers, and all _savants_ of the eighteenth century, this abbe was\r\nrepresented as being in a state of frightful misery and destitution. He\r\nwho possessed the secrets of plants and minerals, of fire and light, of\r\nthe generation of beings, had not the wherewithal to procure himself a\r\ndecent _soutane_, nor even a morsel of bread. Though, by the efforts of\r\nhis magic, he had reached a dizzy height on the paths of knowledge, it\r\nwas, alas! a fact but too true, that he was unable to maintain himself\r\nmore than a month in the same apartment--perhaps on account of his\r\nindifference to the interests of his landlords. For all that he was a\r\nmarvellous being, inventing specifics for the cure of all diseases, and\r\nconsequently of asthma among the rest. It was even whispered, but\r\nsecretly and mysteriously, and with a sort of awe--for they were very\r\nsuperstitious, though very atheistical, in the eighteenth century--that\r\nall these specifics were comprised in one remedy, namely, the\r\ncelebrated AURUM POTABILE, or fluid gold. Now every one knows, or at\r\nleast ought to know, that potable gold, that is, gold in a cold and\r\nfluid state, like wine, triumphs over every malady to which the human\r\nframe is subject: it is health itself, perpetual youth, and would be no\r\nless than immortality had not Paracelsus, who, they say, also possessed\r\nthe secret of potable gold, unfortunately died at the age of\r\nthirty-three, or thirty-five: thus establishing a fatal argument against\r\nits virtues in this respect. But one thought now possessed\r\nVoisenon--that of getting hold, somehow or other, of this magic abbe,\r\nand of enticing him to his chateau; but an insensate and monstrous\r\ndesire was this--a desire almost impossible to be satisfied, for it was\r\nstated that this Prometheus repelled all advances. Persecuted by the\r\nfaculty, censured by the ecclesiastical tribunal, maltreated by the\r\npolice, who would not suffer anything in the shape of gold-making, he\r\nhad, in his savage misanthropy, renounced all further thoughts of\r\nalleviating the pains of humanity at the cost of his repose and safety.\r\nHere was a terrible state of perplexity for our asthmatical abbe, who,\r\nfor all that, did not lose courage, but set to work with all his might\r\nto discover the great physician.\r\n\r\nBut where, or how, was he to discover a sorcerer in Paris? To whom could\r\nhe decently address himself? To what professional class? There are so\r\nmany people in the world ready to ridicule even the most respectable\r\nthings. Every time that Voisenon elbowed at the Tuileries, or in the\r\nPalais Royal, an individual in a seedy cassock, he fancied that he had\r\ndiscovered his man. Forthwith he would enter into conversation with him,\r\nhis heart fluttering with hope, until the moment came which would\r\nconvince him that he had been deceived. Though for the moment cast into\r\ndespair, he did not lose hope, but would the next day recommence his\r\nvoyages of discovery in search of potable gold. One morning he had a\r\nsudden illumination:--\"Since the archbishop,\" thought he, \"has censured\r\nthe conduct of the abbe I have been so long in search of, the archbishop\r\nmust know where he lodges.\" Just as if sorcerers had lodgings! That very\r\nday he repaired to the archbishop's court. If the reader wonders why our\r\nabbe did not give the clerks whom he interrogated the name of his\r\nmysterious priest, the answer is easy: it is simply because he did not\r\nknow his name; magicians seldom make themselves known but by their\r\nworks. This name, however, to his great and inexpressible joy, he was\r\nsoon to learn. After some researches made in the register of the\r\nepiscopal court, the clerk informed him that this abbe (a deplorable\r\nsubject by all accounts) was called Boiviel, and, at the period when the\r\nacts of censure were passed upon him, lodged in the Rue de Versailles,\r\nFaubourg Saint Marceau. Voisenon was there almost as soon as the words\r\nwere out of the clerk's mouth.\r\n\r\nVoisenon knocked at every kennel of this deplorable street; not even a\r\nbark replied to the name of the Abbe Boiviel. At length, at a seventh\r\nfloor above the mud, an old woman, who resided in a loft, to which\r\naccess was obtained by means of a rope-ladder, informed him that the\r\nAbbe Boiviel had quitted the apartment about six months before, with the\r\navowed intention of going to lodge at Menilmontant; she added, that this\r\ndelay gave fair grounds for supposing that he must necessarily have\r\nchanged his quarters at least five or six times in the course of these\r\nsix months. Disappointed, but not discouraged, Voisenon descended from\r\nthe dizzy height, reflecting upon the sad distress to which a man might\r\nbe reduced, although possessing the secret of potable gold.\r\n\r\nAn almost incredible chance had so willed it, that the Abbe Boiviel had\r\nchanged his abode but three times since his descent from the garret of\r\nthe Rue de Versailles. From Menilmontant he had removed to Passy, and\r\nfrom Passy to La Chapelle, where he now resided.\r\n\r\nAt length the two abbes met; but to what delicate manoeuvres the\r\nseigneur of Voisenon was obliged to have recourse in accosting his\r\nrugged _comfrere_, who was at that moment engaged in eating his\r\nbreakfast off a chair. He had sense enough to put off as long as\r\npossible the true subject of his visit; besides, what cared he for\r\ndelays? He had found him at last, he was face to face with the\r\nmysterious, infallible physician, the successor of the great Albert.\r\nBoiviel was even more savage and morose than the Abbe de Voisenon had\r\nanticipated. He spoke of offering his services to the Missionary Society\r\nin order to get appointed to preach the Gospel in Japan, although, to\r\ntell the truth, he did not believe over-much in Christianity. \"And I do\r\nnot believe in Japan,\" might have perhaps replied the Abbe de Voisenon,\r\nhad he been in a joking humor: but the fact is, he was thunderstruck at\r\nthe enunciation of such a project. It was too provoking, when he, had at\r\nlength found the Abbe Boiviel, to hear that the Abbe Boiviel was going\r\nto immolate himself in Japan.\r\n\r\nInspired by circumstance, that tenth muse which is worth all the nine\r\nput together, Voisenon said to Boiviel, that he was aware of all the\r\npersecutions which the clergy of Paris had made him endure for causes\r\nwhich he did not desire to know; he refrained also from entering on the\r\nsubject of fluid gold. Touched by the exhibition of so much constancy in\r\nmisfortune, he had come, he said, to propose to the Abbe Boiviel to\r\ninhabit his chateau of Voisenon, where, in the calm and repose of a\r\npeaceful existence, and with a mind freed from the harassing cares of\r\nthe world, he would have leisure to meditate and write; that this\r\nproceeding of his, though strange in appearance, was excusable, and to\r\nbe judged with an indulgent eye; he, the Abbe de Voisenon, was happy,\r\nrich, powerful even. The Abbe Boiviel would be quite at home at the\r\nchateau de Voisenon; his feelings of independence would not be\r\noutraged; when he should be tired of sojourning there, he might quit the\r\nchateau, remain absent as long as it pleased him, and return when it\r\nsuited his fancy. It is hardly necessary to say that the wild boar\r\nallowed itself to be muzzled; that very evening a hired carriage\r\nconducted the chemist, the sorcerer, the magician Boiviel, to the\r\nChateau de Voisenon. \"I shall have my potable gold at last,\" thought the\r\ntriumphant Abbe, radiant with hope and exultation.\r\n\r\nInstalled at the chateau, the Abbe Boiviel conformed himself with a very\r\ngood grace to the monachal existence led by its inmates. The good\r\nregimen of the house tended also to considerably soften the former\r\nasperities of his demeanor; he spoke no more of Japan, but neither did\r\nhe speak of the potable gold, although Voisenon on several occasions\r\nendeavored to obtain from him an explanation on this essential point.\r\nWhenever our asthmatical abbe would lead the conversation towards\r\nsubjects relating to chemistry or alchemy, Boiviel would either avoid a\r\ndirect reply or else fall into a state of profound taciturnity: and yet\r\nall his debts had been paid, including the various outstanding accounts\r\ndue to his numerous landlords, and his dinners at the Croix de\r\nLorraine--that memorable tavern, where all the abbes who received\r\nfifteen sous for every mass said at St. Sulpice were accustomed to feed\r\ndaily. Several cassocks had also been purchased for him, several pairs\r\nof stockings, and many shirts.\r\n\r\nAfter a three months' residence at the chateau he had become fat, fresh,\r\nand rosy, such as he had never before been at any previous epoch of his\r\nlife. Emboldened by the friendship he had shown to his guest, Voisenon\r\nventured one day to say to the Abbe Boiviel, that, skeptical and\r\natheistical as they falsely imagined him to be in the world, he\r\npossessed, nevertheless, an absolute faith in alchemy; he denied neither\r\nthe philosopher's stone, nor the universal panacea, nor even the potable\r\ngold. Now did he, or did he not, believe in potable gold? This was a\r\nhome-thrust Boiviel could no longer recoil; he _did_ believe in it; but\r\naccording to his idea the audacious chemist committed a great sin in\r\ncomposing it: it was, so to speak, as though attacking the decrees of\r\ncreation to change into liquid what had been ordained a metal. A\r\nsorcerer troubled with religious scruples appeared a strange spectacle\r\nto the Abbe de Voisenon and one, too, that rather embarrassed him. He\r\ndid not, however, entirely renounce his conquest of the potable gold; he\r\nwaited three months longer, and during these three months fresh favors\r\nwere lavished on Boiviel, who habituated himself to these proceedings\r\nwith praiseworthy resignation.\r\n\r\nTreated as a friend, called also by that title, Boiviel justified the\r\nAbbe de Voisenon in saying to him one day, that he had no longer a hope\r\nin any remedy whatsoever, save the potable gold, for the cure of his\r\nasthma. Without the specific, as much above other remedies as the sun is\r\nabove fire, the only course left him was to die. Boiviel was moved, his\r\niron resolves were shaken, and his qualms of conscience ceded to the\r\nvoice of friendship. He warned his friend, however, that in order to\r\ncompose a little fluid gold much solid gold would be required. The first\r\nessay would cost ten thousand livres at the very least. Voisenon, who\r\nwould have given twenty thousand to be cured, consented to the\r\nsacrifice, thanking heartily his future liberator, who, on the following\r\nday, commenced the great work. What sage deliberation did he bring to\r\nthe task! and how slowly did the work proceed! Day followed day, month\r\nfollowed month, but as yet no gold, except that which the Abbe de\r\nVoisenon himself contributed in pieces of twenty-four livres each. The\r\nday at length arrived in which, the ten thousand livres being exhausted,\r\nBoiviel informed his patient that the fluid gold was in flasks, and\r\nwould be ready for use in a month.\r\n\r\nIt was during this month that the alchemist Boiviel took leave of the\r\nAbbe de Voisenon, on the pretext of going to see his old father, who\r\nresided in Flanders. Before two months were out he would return to the\r\nchateau, in order to observe the beneficial effects of the liquified\r\nmetal. Warmly embraced by his friend, overwhelmed with presents,\r\nsolicited to return as speedily as possible, Boiviel quitted the Chateau\r\nde Voisenon, where he had lived for nearly a year, and in what manner we\r\nhave seen.\r\n\r\nAfter the time allowed by Boiviel for the fluid gold to be fit for use\r\nhad elapsed, the Abbe de Voisenon began his course of the medicine. He\r\nemptied the first, the second, and the third flask, awaiting the result\r\nwith exemplary patience; but an asthma is not to be cured in a week,\r\nespecially an asthma of forty years' standing.\r\n\r\nBoiviel had not yet returned; he had now been four months in Flanders;\r\nto these four months succeeded another four, but no Boiviel; the year\r\nrevolved, the flasks diminished, but still no Boiviel.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that the Abbe Boiviel never reappeared,\r\nand that he was nothing better than a charlatan and a thief. But the\r\nsingular part of the matter is, that the Abbe de Voisenon found his\r\nasthma considerably relieved after a course of the fluid gold composed\r\nby Boiviel; and his sole regret at the end of his days was, not having\r\nforeseen the death, or disappearance--a matter quite as disastrous--of\r\nhis alchemist, who could have furnished him with the means of\r\ncompounding the elixir for himself as it might be wanted.\r\n\r\nIn order to show himself superior to the assaults of his enemy, our Abbe\r\nwould often endeavor to persuade himself that he was every whit as\r\nactive as he had formerly been; more active even than he had been in\r\nhis youth. On these occasions he would jump up from his easy-chair,\r\nwhere he had been sitting groaning under an attack of the asthma; he\r\nwould cast his pillows on one side, his night-cap on the other, would\r\npitch his slippers to the other end of the room, and call loudly for his\r\ndomestics. In one of these deceitful triumphs of his will over his\r\nfeeble constitution, he rang one cold winter's morning for his _valet de\r\nchambre_.\r\n\r\n\"My thick cloth trousers!\" cried he, \"my thick cloth trousers!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Monsieur l'Abbe,\" timidly objected his faithful servitor, \"what\r\ncan you be thinking of? you were very bad yesterday evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's very probable; I have nothing to do with what I was yesterday\r\nevening. My thick cloth trousers, I tell you--now, my furred waistcoat!\r\nCome, look sharp!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Monsieur l'Abbe, why quit your warm room, your snug arm-chair? You\r\nare so pale.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pale, am I! that's better than ever, for I have been as yellow as a\r\nquince all my life! Good, I have my trousers and waistcoat; fetch me my\r\nredingote!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your redingote! that you only put on when you are going out?\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is precisely because I am going out that I ask for it. You argue\r\nto-day like a true stage valet. Why should I not put on my redingote?\r\nAre you afraid of it becoming shabby? Do you wish to steal it from me\r\nwhile it is new?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that you will increase your cough if you don't keep the\r\nhouse to-day. It is very cold this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very cold, is it, eh? so much the better. I like cold weather.\"\r\n\r\n\"It snows even very much, Monsieur l'Abbe.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, my large Polish boots.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your large Polish boots! And for what purpose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to write a poem in, probably; for if Boileau very sensibly\r\nremarked, that in order to write a good poem time and taste were\r\nnecessary, he did not add that boots were indispensable. Once for all, I\r\nwant my Polish boots to go out shooting in. Is not that plain enough,\r\nMonsieur Mascarille?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cough shooting, Monsieur l'Abbe?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Maraud!_ wolf-shooting--in the wood. Come, quick, my boots, and no\r\nchattering.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here are your boots, Monsieur l'Abbe. Truly you have no thought for\r\nyour health.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you a design upon my boots, also? Be so good, most discursive\r\nvalet, as to fetch me my deer-skin gloves, my hat, and gun.\"\r\n\r\nThe Abbe de Voisenon was soon equipped with the aid of his valet, who,\r\nduring the operation of dressing, never ceased repeating to him:\r\n\r\n\"It is fearfully cold this morning. Dogs have been found frozen to death\r\nin their kennels, fish dead in the fish-ponds, cattle dead in the\r\nstables, birds dead on the trees, and even wolves dead in the forest.\"\r\n\r\n\"My good friend,\" replied the Abbe de Voisenon, \"you have said too much;\r\nyour story of the wolves prevents me believing the rest: upon this I\r\nstart. Now listen to me. On my return from shooting I expect to find my\r\npoultices ready, my asses-milk properly warmed, and my _tisanes_ mixed;\r\ngive directions about all this in the kitchen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Monsieur l'Abbe. He'll never return, that's certain,\" murmured the\r\nvalet, as he packed up his master in his great-coat, and drew his fur\r\ncap well down over his ears.\r\n\r\nFollowed by three of his dogs, our abbe started on his shooting\r\nexcursion. At the very first step he took on leaving the court-yard, he\r\nfell; but he was up in an instant, and brushed speedily along. It must\r\nhave been a strange spectacle to see this old man, as black as a mute at\r\na funeral, with his black gloves, black boots, black coat, all black in\r\nshort, tripping gayly along over the snow with three dogs at his heels,\r\nsometimes whistling and shouting aloud, sometimes cracking his\r\npocket-whip, and occasionally pointing his fowling-piece in the\r\ndirection of a flight of crows.\r\n\r\nHe had passed through the village of Voisenon, and had just gained the\r\nopen country, when he was stopped at the entrance of a lane of small\r\ncottages by a young girl, who, the instant she perceived him, cried out,\r\n\r\n\"Ah, monseigneur\" (for many people styled him monseigneur), \"it is\r\nsurely Providence that has sent you to us!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" inquired the abbe.\r\n\r\n\"Our grandfather is dying, and he is unwilling to die without\r\nconfession.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have nothing to do with that, my child; that is the priest's\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"But are you not a priest, monseigneur?\"\r\n\r\n\"Almost,\" replied our abbe, rather taken aback by this home-thrust, and\r\nin a very bad humor besides at the interruption, \"almost; but address\r\nyourself in preference to the prior of the convent. Run to the chateau,\r\nring at the convent-gate; ring loudly, and reserve me for a better\r\noccasion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monseigneur,\" repeated the girl, \"our grandfather has not time to wait;\r\nhe is dying--you must come.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you,\" replied the abbe, confused within himself at his refusal,\r\n\"I cannot go. I am, as you see, out shooting: the thing is utterly\r\nimpossible.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words he sought to pursue his way; but the young girl, who\r\ncould not comprehend the bad arguments made use of by the abbe, clung\r\nobstinately to his coat skirts, and compelled him to turn round. Aroused\r\nby the noise of this altercation, a few of the male population appeared\r\non the thresholds of their doors, others at their windows; and as a\r\nvillage resembles a bundle of dry hay, which a spark will set in a\r\nblaze, the wives joined their husbands, the children their mothers, and\r\nsoon the entire population flocked into the street to see what was the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe Abbe du Jard, seigneur of Voisenon, king of the country, felt deeply\r\nhumiliated amid the crowd which surrounded him, and which had already\r\nbegun to murmur at this refusal, as irreligious as it was inhuman.\r\n\r\nBut our poor abbe was not inhuman. The fact was, he had completely\r\nforgotten the formula used on such occasions; and if the truth must be\r\ntold, as he was careless and indifferent in religious matters, rather\r\nthan hypocritical, his conscience reproached him for going to absolve or\r\ncondemn a fellow-creature when he inwardly felt how utterly unworthy he\r\nwas himself of judging others at the tribunal of the confessional.\r\n\r\nNecessity, however, prevailed over his just scruples; which scruples,\r\nhowever, be it said, could not be made use of as excuses to his vassals:\r\nso, with downcast eyes and his reversed fowling-piece under his arm, he\r\npermitted himself to be led to the cottage where lay the old man, who\r\nwas unwilling to render his last sigh without having made the official\r\navowal of his sins.\r\n\r\nThe villagers knelt in a circle before the door, whilst the abbe seated\r\nhimself by the side of the dying man, in order the better to receive his\r\nconfession.\r\n\r\nSince the unlucky moment in which the Abbe de Voisenon had been balked\r\nof his morning's sport, he had lost--for he had at times his intervals\r\nof superstitious terror--the proud determination he had formed of not\r\nbelieving himself ill on that day. But then, what signs of evil augury\r\nhad greeted him! He had tripped and fallen on leaving home; he had seen\r\nflocks of crows; a weeping girl had dragged him to the bedside of a\r\nterrified sinner--even now they were repeating the prayers for the dying\r\naround him. The Abbe de Voisenon was overcome; his former temerity oozed\r\npalpably away, he felt sick at heart, his ears tingled, his asthma\r\ngroaned within his chest.\r\n\r\n\"I am ill,\" thought he. \"I was in the wrong to come out; why did I not\r\ntake my old servant's advice, and remain at home?\"\r\n\r\nFinally he lent an ear to the old man's confession.\r\n\r\n\"You were born the same day as myself!\" exclaimed the abbe, at the\r\npatient's first confidential communication; \"you were born the same day\r\nas myself!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man continued, and here a new terror arose for our abbe.\r\n\r\n\"You have never heard mass to the end! And I,\" thought he, \"have never\r\nheard even the beginning for these last thirty years!\"\r\n\r\nThe penitent continued:--\r\n\r\n\"I have committed, monseigneur, the great sin that you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"The great sin that I know! I know so many,\" thought the abbe. \"What\r\nsin, my friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yea, the great sin--although married--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I understand!\" Then, _sotto voce_, \"My great sin, although a\r\npriest.\"\r\n\r\nA deplorable fatality, if it was a fatality, had so willed it that the\r\nvassal should have fallen into the same snares as had his lord, who was\r\nnow called to judge him at his last hour.\r\n\r\nWhen the confession was ended, the Abbe de Voisenon consulted his own\r\nheart with inward terror, and after some hesitation he remitted his\r\npenitent's sins, inwardly avowing to himself that the dying man ought,\r\nat least, out of gratitude, to render him the same service.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony over, the abbe rose to depart: but his limbs failed him,\r\nand they were actually obliged to carry him home, where he arrived in a\r\nstate of prostration that seriously alarmed his household. During the\r\nremainder of that day he spoke to no one; wrapped up in the silence of\r\nhis own melancholy thoughts, he opened his lips only to cough. The night\r\nwas bad; icy shiverings passed over his frame: the image of this man, of\r\nthe same age, and burdened with the same sins as he himself had\r\ncommitted, would not leave his memory. By daylight his trouble of mind\r\nand body was at its height; he desired his valet to summon his physician\r\nand the prior of the convent. \"And immediately,\" added he,\r\n\"immediately.\"\r\n\r\nComprehending better this time the wishes of his master, the domestic\r\nhastened to arouse the prior, whose convent almost adjoined the chateau,\r\nand the physician, who had apartments in the chateau itself. This\r\nphysician was a young man, chosen by the celebrated Tronchin from among\r\nhis cleverest pupils at the express desire of the Abbe de Voisenon.\r\n\r\nSeriously alarmed at the danger of the abbe, both prior and physician\r\nhastened to obey the summons. M. de Voisenon was so ill last night.\r\nShould they arrive in time? So equal and so prompt was their zeal that\r\nboth reached the abbe's bedroom door together. But when they opened it,\r\nwhat was their astonishment to find that the bird had flown; our abbe\r\nhad got over his little fright, and had gone out shooting again.\r\n\r\nThe end of that fatal eighteenth century was now approaching; undermined\r\nby years and debauchery, it was now like a ruined spend-thrift moving\r\naway from the calendar of the world in rags; it was hideously old, but\r\nits years inspired not respect. Old king, old ministers, old\r\ngenerals--if indeed there were generals,--old courtiers, old mistresses,\r\nold poets, old musicians, old opera dancers, broken down with _ennui_,\r\npleasure, and idleness--toothless, faded, rouged, and wrinkled--were\r\ndescending slowly to the tomb. Louis XV. formed one of the funeral\r\nprocession; he was taken to St. Denis between two lines of _cabarets_\r\nfilled with drunken revellers, madly rejoicing at being rid of this\r\nplague, which another plague had carried off to the grave. Crebillon was\r\ndead; the son of the great Racine, honored by the famous title of Member\r\nof the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres, was taken off by a\r\nmalignant fever, and obtained from the grateful publicity of the day\r\nthe following necrological eulogium, as brief as it was eloquent: \"M.\r\nRacine, last of the name, died yesterday of a malignant fever; as a man\r\nof letters he was long dead, having become stupefied by wine and\r\ndevotion.\" Twelve days afterwards Marivaux followed Racine to the grave.\r\nThe Abbe Prevost died of a tenth attack of apoplexy in the forest of\r\nChantilly. In the following spring the celebrated Madame de Pompadour\r\ndescended, at the age of forty-four, into the grave, after having\r\nexhaled a _bon mot_ in guise of confession. Desirous, as it would\r\nappear, of leaving this world like the rest of his worthy _comperes_,\r\nthe composer Rameau cried furiously to his confessor, whose lugubrious\r\nnote while intoning the service at his bedside offended the delicacy of\r\nhis ear, 'What the devil are you muttering there, Monsieur le Cure? you\r\nare horribly out of tune!' And thereupon Master Rameau expired of a\r\nputrid fever. And what think you, worthy reader, occupied the public the\r\nday following the death of the most celebrated musician in Europe, the\r\nking of the French school? Why, nothing less than this wonderful piece\r\nof news: \"Mademoiselle Mire, of the Opera, more celebrated as a\r\ncourtesan than as a _danseuse_, has interred her lover; on his tomb are\r\nengraven these words:\r\n\r\n    MI RE LA MI LA.\"\r\n\r\nA touching funeral oration, truly, for poor Rameau! Panard, the father\r\nof the French vaudeville, died some days after Rameau; and the Parisian\r\npublic, with its national tenderness of heart, merely remarked, that\r\n\"the words could not be separated from the accompaniment.\"\r\n\r\nYou see, reader, how the ranks were thinning, how all these old candles\r\nwere expiring in their sockets, how the ball was approaching its end.\r\n\r\n\"Piron died yesterday,\" writes a journalist; and he adds, \"They say he\r\nreceived the cure of St. Roche very badly.\" What an admirable piece of\r\nbuffoonery! these cures going in turn to shrive the writers of the\r\neighteenth century, and having flung at their heads epigrams composed\r\nfor the occasion, perhaps, ten years before.\r\n\r\nLouis XV. died soon after Piron. A few hours before his death he said to\r\nCardinal de la Roche-Aymon: \"Although the king is answerable to God\r\nalone for his conduct, you can say that he is sorry for having caused\r\nany scandal to his subjects, and that from henceforth he desires to live\r\nbut for the support of faith and religion, and for the happiness of his\r\npeople!\"\r\n\r\nLike Rameau, Piron, Helvetius, and Pompadour, this good little king\r\nLouis XV. must have his _bon mot_; he was sorry for having caused any\r\nscandal to his subjects, and at his last moment of existence would live\r\nfrom henceforth for the sole happiness of his people! \"Can any thing be\r\nfiner than this?\"\r\n\r\nFinally came the Abbe de Voisenon's turn. Witty to his last hour, when\r\nthey brought home the leaden coffin, the exact form and dimensions of\r\nwhich he had himself arranged and ordered beforehand, he said to one of\r\nhis domestics,--\r\n\r\n\"There is a great-coat, any how, that you will not be tempted to steal\r\nfrom me.\"\r\n\r\nHe died on the 22d of November, 1775, aged sixty-eight.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Q] This was the celebrated society called the _Academie de ces\r\nMessieurs_: it numbered among its members all the more celebrated wits\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRELAND IN THE LAST AGE.\r\n\r\nRecollections of Curran.\r\n\r\nFrom the London Times\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the work of Mr. Charles Phillips were a description of the Roman bar\r\nin the time of Hadrian, it would scarcely be more completely than at\r\npresent the picture of a time and system entirely passed away; yet he\r\nprofesses to give us--and performs his promise--a somewhat gossipping\r\nand very amusing description of the Irish bar, and the great men\r\nbelonging to it, very little more than half a century since. But we\r\ntravel and change quickly in these days of steam and railroads; even\r\nTime himself appears now to have attached his travelling carriage to a\r\nlocomotive, and in the space of one man's life performs a journey that\r\nin staid and ancient days would have occupied the years of many\r\ngenerations, and, as if in illustration of the fleeting nature of men\r\nand things and systems at this time, here we find a contemporary (at\r\nthis moment hardly past the prime of life) giving us portraits, and\r\nrelating anecdotes of men with whom he, in his youth, lived in intimate\r\nand professional relations, but who seem now as absolutely to belong to\r\na bygone order of things, as if they had wrangled before the Dikasts of\r\nAthens, or pleaded before the Praetor at Rome. Mr. Phillips seems to feel\r\nthis, and, as the gay days of his sanguine youth flit by his memory, the\r\nretrospect brings, as it will ever bring, melancholy, and even sadness,\r\nwith it. Yielding himself up to the dominion of feeling, in place of\r\nkeeping his reason predominant, he mourns over the past, as if, in\r\ncomparison with the present, it were greatly more worthy. Forgetting\r\nthat there is a change also in himself; that the capacity for enjoyment\r\nis largely diminished; that hope has been fulfilled, or is for ever\r\nfrustrate; he tests the present by his own emotions, instead of weighing\r\nwith philosophic _indifference_ the relative merits of the system that\r\nhe describes, and of that in which he lives. We are told--\r\n\r\n    \"'Tis distance lends enchantment to the view;\"\r\n\r\nbut, when age comes upon us, we must turn and look back, if we desire to\r\nenjoy this pleasing hallucination.\r\n\r\nBut in what is the present of Ireland so different from the past, in\r\nwhich our fathers lived? And what do these repinings mean? What is the\r\ncharm that has for ever faded? The answer to this question, if complete,\r\nwould occupy a volume, for the composition of which that of Mr. Phillips\r\nmight well serve in the character of _une piece historique_, abounding,\r\nas it does, in apt and instructive illustration, and giving, by its\r\naggregation of anecdotes and descriptions, a somewhat confused but\r\nstill interesting and lively picture of a very curious and stirring\r\nperiod. There lies, indeed, at the bottom of this inquiry a question\r\nwith which the practical statesman has now little reason to trouble\r\nhimself, but which, nevertheless, to the speculative philosopher, cannot\r\nfail to be a subject of never-failing interest.\r\n\r\nThe great physical discoveries of modern times, by which the powers of\r\nnature are made to act in subservience to the use and comfort of\r\nmankind, steadily tend to one great political result, viz., the\r\npermanently uniting and knitting together of much larger numbers of men\r\ninto one and the same community, and subjecting them to one and the same\r\nGovernment, and that Government one of law and not of force, than was\r\never known or possible during the early days of man's history. This\r\nresult, as regards the peace of the world and all the material comforts\r\nof life, is highly favorable. Whether the same can be said, of the\r\nmental vigor and moral excellence of the human race is a question upon\r\nwhich men may speculate, but which time alone can satisfactorily answer.\r\n\r\nThe small, contentious, and active communities of Greece; the little,\r\nill-governed, yet vigorous Republics of modern Italy, stand out in the\r\nhistory of mankind bright and illustrious beyond all hope of comparison;\r\nand, from the wondrous intellects that appeared among them, they have\r\nproved to all succeeding times a never-failing subject of admiration,\r\nenvy, and despair. Just in proportion to our own advancement in art,\r\nliterature, and science, is the intensity of our astonishment, of our\r\nenvy, and of our despondency. We endeavor to compete with, but can never\r\nequal them; we imitate, but, like all imitators, we are condemned to\r\nmediocrity; it is only when we attempt to explore some new and untrod\r\nregion of art or science that we can pretend to the dignity even of\r\ncomparison. And these regions are rare indeed.\r\n\r\nBut, if we compare our own social condition with that of the Greeks or\r\nthe Italians--if we look into their houses, their cities, and their\r\nfields,--if we acquire an accurate and vivid conception of the\r\ninsecurity of life, of property, and of peace among them,--and if we\r\nmeasure the happiness of life by the comforts of every day existence,\r\nthen, indeed, the superiority belongs to ourselves; and we may be led to\r\nask, whether the advantages of both conditions of political and social\r\nexistence may not be united; and to that end seek to learn what it was\r\nthat brought out into such vigorous relief the wonderful mental activity\r\nof the two periods, which form such peculiar and hitherto unequalled\r\nepocha in the history of mankind. We shall find, if we pursue this\r\ninquiry into other times and among other people, that there was one\r\ncircumstance, among many others indeed, of peculiar weight and\r\nimportance, which then exercised and has never failed to exercise,\r\nwheresoever it has existed, a vast influence upon the mental and moral\r\ncharacter of the people--we mean a feeling of intense _nationality_.\r\nThis feeling is not all that is required; without it no great\r\noriginality or vigor in a people is probable, and where it has been\r\nstrongly manifest, it has generally led to great deeds, and much mental\r\nactivity. The character of this manifestation will, indeed, greatly\r\ndepend upon the natural character of the people--upon the peculiar state\r\nof their civilization, and upon their political condition. If these be\r\nall favorable, the spirit of nationality is divine, and manifest in\r\ngreat and ennobling deeds and thoughts; but, if adverse, then the spirit\r\nwill be destructive, and vice will be quickened into fatal activity.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, at the end of the eighteenth century, a remarkable series of\r\nevents cherished, if it did not indeed produce, this sentiment of a\r\nseparate nationality and independence. Conquerors and conquered, in\r\nspite of social and religious distinctions, had long since coalesced\r\ninto one people; and the successful revolt of our American colonies,\r\ninduced the people of Ireland to demand for themselves freedom and\r\nindependence also. With arms in their hands the Volunteers wrung from\r\nEngland an independent Parliament in 1782; and in the eighteen years\r\nwhich followed, all that is really great in the history of Ireland, is\r\ncomprised. The Volunteers, indeed, obtained independence, but that was\r\nall. The constitution of the Irish was, as before, narrow and\r\nmischievous, oppressive and corrupt; but it was Irish, and independent\r\nof the Parliament of England. And the struggles of an independent\r\npeople, endeavoring, by their own efforts, to reform their own\r\ninstitutions, led to the rising of that brilliant galaxy of statesmen,\r\norators, wits, and lawyers, to which Irishmen of the present day, almost\r\nwithout exception, refer with grief and despondency, not unmixed with\r\nindignation, when wishing to make the world appreciate the evils their\r\ncountry has suffered in consequence of its union with England. But,\r\nunhappily, the great spirit of freedom was awakened in evil times.\r\nGreat, vigorous, and almost glorious was this wonderful manifestation of\r\nits power; but eventually the horrible corruption and vice of the period\r\nbore all before it, and extinguished every chance of benefit from the\r\nacquisition of independence. Great men appeared, but they were\r\npowerless. Of the remarkable period in which they lived, however, every\r\nmemorial is of interest. With the society of which they formed a part,\r\nso different from our own--with the character and manners of the men\r\nthemselves, their history, their good sayings and wild deeds, every\r\nstudent of history wishes to become acquainted, and seizes with avidity\r\nupon every piece of evidence from which authentic information respecting\r\nthem may be gathered--and, as a portion of this evidence, the work of\r\nMr. Phillips deserves consideration.\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable of the many distinguished characters of this\r\nstirring period was John Philpot Curran,--among Irish advocates, as was\r\nErskine among those of England, _facile princeps_. With him, when on\r\nthe bench as Master of the Rolls in Ireland, Mr. Phillips, himself then\r\na junior at the Irish bar, became acquainted. Acquaintance became\r\nintimacy, and intimacy led to friendship, which lasted without\r\ninterruption to the day of Curran's death. Admiration and affection\r\ninduced Mr. Phillips to gather together memorials of his deceased\r\nfriend, round whose portrait he has grouped sketches of many of his\r\ncelebrated cotemporaries. He says in his preface--\r\n\r\n\"My object has been, touching as lightly as possible on the politics of\r\nthe time, to give merely personal sketches of the characters as they\r\nappeared upon the scene to me. Many of them were my acquaintances--some\r\nof them my intimates; and the aim throughout has been a verisimilitude\r\nin the portraiture;--in short, to make the reader as familiar with the\r\noriginals as I was myself.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a more curious collection of likenesses was never crowded into one\r\ncanvas. They all, indeed, have a strong family resemblance, but\r\ncertainly they are like nothing else in nature; and to us, living in\r\ngrave, and possibly dull and prosaic England--and in this our matter of\r\nfact and decorous age--the doings of the society which they have made\r\nillustrious, appear more like a mad _saturnalia_ than the sober and\r\ncommonplace procedure of rational men. The whole people--every class,\r\nprofession, and degree--seemed to consider life but a species of\r\ndelirious dance, and a wild and frantic excitement the one sole\r\npleasure. Repose, thoughtfulness, and calm, they must have considered a\r\npremature death. Every emotion was sought for in its extreme, and a\r\nrapid variation from merriment to misery, from impassioned love to\r\nviolent hate, was the ordinary (if in such an existence any thing could\r\nbe deemed ordinary)--the common and ordinary condition of life.\r\nLaughter, that was ever on the brink of tears--a wild joy, that might in\r\nan instant be followed by hopeless despondency--alternations from\r\nsanguine and eager hope to blank and apparently crushing despair,--such\r\nwas Irish life, in which every one appeared to be acting a part, and\r\nstriving to appear original by means of a strained and laborious\r\naffectation. Steady, continued, and rational industry, was either\r\nunknown or despised; economy was looked upon as meanness--thrift was\r\ncalled avarice--and the paying a just debt, except upon compulsion, was\r\ndeemed conduct wholly unworthy of a gentleman. Take the account Mr.\r\nPhillips himself gives. He speaks of the Irish squire; but the Irish\r\nsquire was the raw material out of which so-called Irish gentlemen were\r\nmade. \"The Irish squire of half a century ago _scorned_ not to be in\r\ndebt; it would be beneath his dignity to live within his income; and\r\nnext to not incurring a debt, the greatest degradation would have been\r\nvoluntarily to _pay one_.\" And yet was there great pretension to\r\n_honor_, but a man of honor of those days would in our time be\r\nconsidered a ruffian certainly, and probably a blackleg or a swindler.\r\n\"It was a favorite boast of his (the first Lord Norbury) that he began\r\nlife with fifty pounds, and a pair of hair-trigger pistols.\" \"They\r\nserved his purpose well.... The luck of the hair-triggers triumphed, and\r\nToler not only became Chief Justice, but the founder of two peerages,\r\nand the testator of an enormous fortune. After his promotion, the code\r\nof honor became, as it were, engrafted on that of the Common Pleas; the\r\nnoble chief not unfrequently announcing that he considered himself a\r\njudge only while he wore his robes.\" The sort of law dispensed by this\r\nfire-eating judge might be easily conceived even without the aid of such\r\nan anecdote as the following: \"A nonsuit was never heard of in his time.\r\nIll-natured people said it was to draw suitors to his court.\" Toler's\r\nreason for it was that he was too _constitutional_ to interfere with a\r\njury, Be that as it may, a nonsuit was a nonentity, 'I hope, my Lord,'\r\nsaid counsel in a case actually commanding one, 'your Lordship will, for\r\nonce, have the courage to nonsuit? In a moment the hair-triggers were\r\nuppermost. 'Courage! I tell you what, Mr. Wallace, there are two sorts\r\nof courage--courage to shoot, and courage to nonshoot--and I have both;\r\nbut nonshoot now I certainly will not; and argument is only a waste of\r\ntime.' \"I remember well,\" says Mr. Phillips, when speaking of another\r\njudge, Mr. Justice Fletcher, \"at the Sligo summer assizes for 1812,\r\nbeing counsel in the case of 'The King _v._ Fenton,' for the murder of\r\nMajor Hillas in a duel, when old Judge Fletcher thus capped his summing\r\nup to the jury: 'Gentlemen, it's my business to lay down the law to you,\r\nand I will. The law says, the killing a man in a duel is murder, and I\r\nam bound to tell you it is murder; therefore, in the discharge of my\r\nduty, I tell you so; but I tell you at the same time, a _fairer duel_\r\nthan this I never heard of in the whole _coorse_ of my life.' It is\r\nscarcely necessary to add that there was an immediate acquittal.\" By way\r\nof giving some idea of the character of society then, the following\r\nenumeration is supplied by the memory of Mr. Phillips:--\r\n\r\n     \"Lord Clare, afterwards Lord Chancellor, fought Curran,\r\n     afterwards Master of the Rolls. So much for equity; but common\r\n     law also sustained its reputation. Clonmel, afterwards Chief\r\n     Justice, fought two Lords and two Commoners,--to show his\r\n     impartiality, no doubt. Medge, afterwards Baron, fought his own\r\n     brother-in-law, and two others. Toler, afterwards Chief Justice\r\n     of the Common Pleas, fought three persons, one of whom was\r\n     Fitzgerald, even in Ireland the 'fire-eater,' _par excellence_.\r\n     Patterson, also afterwards Chief Justice of the same court,\r\n     fought three country gentlemen, one of them with guns, another\r\n     with swords, and wounded them all! Corry, Chancellor of the\r\n     Exchequer, fought Mr. Grattan. The Provost of Dublin\r\n     University, a Privy Councillor, fought Mr. Doyle, a Master in\r\n     Chancery, and several others. His brother, collector of\r\n     Customs, fought Lord Mountmorris. Harry Deane Grady, counsel to\r\n     the Revenue, fought several duels; and 'all hits,' adds\r\n     Barrington, with unction. Curran fought four persons, one of\r\n     whom was Egan, Chairman of Kilmainham; afterwards his friend,\r\n     with Lord Buckinghamshire. A duel in these days was often a\r\n     prelude to intimacy.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite, nevertheless, of this rude, nay, almost wild condition of\r\nsociety,--in spite of a most fantastic affectation attending nearly\r\nevery act and thought and word,--yet were Curran and his cotemporaries\r\nmen of great and vigorous ability. Grattan, Curran, and Flood, deserve\r\nindeed to take rank among the foremost class of their own age,--among\r\nthe men of genius of every age and country. If we speak of them as\r\norators, and wish to judge of their excellence with relation to the\r\ngreat orators of our own country, we must bear in mind the character of\r\nthe society in which they lived, and of the assemblies they addressed.\r\nIt would be unjust to try them by the rules of our fastidious taste and\r\nundemonstrative manners. They addressed Irishmen, and Irishmen just when\r\nmost excited, and indulging in all the wild sallies of a dearly-prized\r\nand lately acquired independence. What to us would appear offensive rant\r\nand disgusting affectation, would, in the Irish House of Commons, have\r\nbeen but the usual manifestation of strong feeling, and was absolutely\r\nrequired, if the speaker desired to move as well as convince his\r\nauditory.\r\n\r\nIf, however, we seek to know what was the virtue of these men, more\r\nespecially that of Curran, we must probe to the bottom the corruptions\r\nand baseness of that society, which deserves to be branded as among the\r\nmost base and the most corrupt that history has hitherto described. The\r\ntemptations which England employed, the horrible corruption and\r\nprofligacy she fostered, must be fully known, if we desire to do justice\r\nto the men who came out undefiled from that filthy ordeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOST LETTER.\r\n\r\nFrom Chambers' Papers for the People.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nOne night, between twenty and thirty years ago, a party were assembled\r\nin the drawing-rooms of a house situated in one of the most spacious\r\nsquares of the great metropolis. The brightly lighted lamps lent an\r\nadditional lustre to yet brighter eyes, and the sprightly tones of\r\nvarious instruments accompanied the graceful evolutions of the dancers,\r\nas they threaded the mazes of the country-dance, cotillon, or quadrille;\r\nfor waltz, polka, and schottish, were then unknown in our ball-rooms.\r\nHere and there sat a couple in a quiet corner, evidently enjoying the\r\npleasures of a flirtation, while one pair, more romantic or more serious\r\nthan the others, had strayed out upon the balcony, to indulge more\r\nunrestrainedly in the conversation, which, to judge by their low and\r\nearnest tones, and abstracted air, seemed deeply interesting to both.\r\n\r\nIt was now long past the hour 'of night's black arch, the keystone,' and\r\nthe early dawn of a midsummer morning was already bestowing its first\r\ncalm sweet smile on the smoke-begrimed streets and world-worn\r\nthoroughfares of mighty London, as well as on the dewy hay-fields, shady\r\nlanes, green hedgerows, and quiet country homes of rural England. The\r\nmorning star, large, mild, and lustrous, was declining in the clear sky;\r\nand on the left of the lovely planet lay a soft purple cloud, tinged on\r\nthe edge with the lucid amber of the dawning day. A light breeze just\r\nstirred the leaves of the trees in the square garden, and fanned the\r\nwarm cheeks of the two spectators, as, suddenly silent, they stood\r\nfeasting their eyes and hearts on the surpassingly beautiful scene\r\nbefore them, and marvelling at the remarkable purity of the atmosphere,\r\nwhich, in the foggy metropolis of Britain, seemed almost to realize the\r\nVenetian transparency of the pictures of Canaletti. Perhaps it may be as\r\nwell to take advantage of the pause to describe the two lovers, for that\r\nthey were lovers you have of course already guessed.\r\n\r\nA handsomer pair, I am sure, you would never wish to see! The well-knit,\r\nwell-proportioned figure of the gentleman bespoke at once activity and\r\nease, while the spirited, intelligent expression of his\r\ncountenance--dark-complexioned as that of an Andalusian--would have\r\ngiven interest to far plainer features. The glance of his dark eye, as\r\nit rested fondly on his fair companion, or was turned abroad on the\r\nworld, told alternately of a loving heart and a proud spirit. Philip\r\nHayforth was one who would have scorned to commit an ignoble action, or\r\nto stain his soul with the shadow of a falsehood for all the treasures\r\nand the blessings the earth has to bestow; but he was quick to resent an\r\ninjury, and slow to forget it, and not for all the world would he have\r\nbeen the first to sue for a reconciliation. Like many other proud\r\npeople, however, he was open-hearted and generous, and ready to forgive\r\nwhen forgiveness was asked; the reason of which might be, that a\r\npetition for pardon is, to the spirit of a proud man, a sort of homage\r\nfar more gratifying than the most skilful flattery, since it establishes\r\nat once his own superiority. But to his Emily, Philip was all\r\nconsideration and tenderness, and she, poor girl, with the simple faith\r\nof youth and love, believed him to be perfection, and admired even his\r\npride. A very lovely girl was Emily Sherwood--gifted with a beauty of a\r\nrare and intellectual cast. As she now stood leaning on the arm of her\r\ncompanion, her tall yet pliant and graceful figure enveloped in the airy\r\ndrapery of her white dress, with her eyes turned in mute admiration\r\ntowards the dawning day, it would have required but a slight stretch of\r\nthe imagination to have beheld in her a priestess of the sun, awaiting\r\nin reverent adoration the appearance of her fire-god. Her complexion and\r\nfeatures, too, would have helped to strengthen the fantasy, for the one\r\nwas singularly fair, pale, and transparent, and the other characterized\r\nby delicacy, refinement, and a sort of earnest yet still enthusiasm. Her\r\nhair, of the softest and palest brown, was arranged in simple yet\r\nmassive plaits around her finely-shaped head, and crowned with a wreath\r\nof 'starry jessamine.' From the absence of color, one might have\r\nimagined that her beauty would have been cold and statue-like; but you\r\nhad only to glance at her soft, intellectual mouth, or to look into her\r\nlarge, clear, hazel eyes, which seemed to have borrowed their sweet,\r\nthoughtful, chastened radiance from the star whose beams were now fast\r\npaling in the brightening sky, to learn that Emily Sherwood could both\r\nthink and love.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Philip,\" she said at last, in that low tone which is the natural\r\nexpression of all the finer and deeper emotions, \"is it not beautiful? I\r\nfeel at this moment as if I were almost oppressed with happiness--as if\r\nthis were but an intense dream of love and beauty, that must, as\r\nsentimental people say, 'be too bright to last.' I never felt as I do\r\nnow in all my life before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I neither, my Emily, my sweet little poetess; but I suppose it is\r\nbecause we love, for love intensifies all the feelings.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the best feelings.\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole nature, I think. It is, for instance, more difficult to bear\r\na slight from those we love than from a comparatively indifferent\r\nperson.\"\r\n\r\n\"A slight! but there can be no such thing as a slight between those who\r\nlove perfectly--as we do. Are we not all in all to each other? Is not\r\nour happiness indivisible?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my pride and joy to believe so, my sweet Emily. I know in my own\r\nheart that the needle is not more true to the magnet than my thoughts\r\nand feelings are to you. It shall be the chief care of my life to save\r\nyou from all uneasiness; but, Emily, I expect the same devotion I give:\r\nunkindness from you, of all the world, I could not and would not\r\nendure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Philip, Philip!\" she said, half tenderly, half reproachfully, \"why\r\nshould you say this? I do not doubt _you_, dear Philip, for I judge your\r\nlove by my own.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked into the truthful and affectionate eyes which were raised so\r\ntrustingly to his face, and replied, in a voice tremulous with emotion,\r\n\"Forgive me, Emily. I trust you entirely; but I had started an idea, the\r\nbarest contemplation of which was insupportable--maddening, because of\r\nthe very excess of my affection. In short, Emily, I know--that is, I\r\nsuspect--your father looked for a higher match for you than I am. Report\r\nsays that his prejudices are strong in favor of birth, and that he is\r\nvery proud of his ancient blood; and the idea did cross me for a moment,\r\nthat when you were with him he might influence you to despise me.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father _is_ proud; but, dear Philip, is nobody proud but he? And\r\nnotwithstanding his prejudices, as you call them, I can assure you, you\r\nare not more honorable yourself in every act and thought than he is. He\r\nhas consented to our marriage, and therefore you need not fear him, even\r\nif you cannot trust me alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Emily, pardon me! And so you think me proud. Well, perhaps I am;\r\nand it is better that you should know it, as you will bear with it, I\r\nknow, for my sake, my best, my truest Emily; and I shall repay your\r\ngoodness with the most fervent gratitude. Yes, I feel with you that no\r\ncloud can ever come between us two.\"\r\n\r\nEmily Sherwood was the eldest daughter of Colonel Sherwood, a cadet of\r\none of the proudest families in England; and which, though it had never\r\nbeen adorned with a title, looked down with something like contempt on\r\nthe abundant growth of mushroom nobility which had sprung up around it,\r\nlong after it had already obtained the dignity which, in the opinion of\r\nthe Sherwoods, generations alone could bestow. Colonel Sherwood\r\ninherited all the pride of his race--nay, in him it had been increased\r\nby poverty; for poverty, except in minds of the highest class--that rare\r\nclass who estimate justly the true value of human life, and the true\r\nnature of human dignity--is generally allied either with pride or\r\nmeanness. Of course when I speak of poverty I mean comparative\r\npoverty--I allude to those who are poorer than their station. In a\r\nretired part of one of the eastern counties, Colonel Sherwood struggled\r\nupon his half-pay to support a wife and seven children, and as far as\r\npossible to keep up the appearance he considered due to his birth and\r\nrank in society. Emily had been for two seasons the belle of the country\r\nballs; and the admiration her beauty and manners had everywhere excited,\r\nhad created in the hearts of her parents a hope that she was destined to\r\nform an alliance calculated to shed a lustre on the fading glory of the\r\nSherwoods. But, alas! as Burns sings--\r\n\r\n    \"The best laid schemes of mice and men\r\n       Gang aft ajee.\"\r\n\r\nDuring a visit to some relatives in London, Emily became acquainted with\r\nPhilip Hayforth; and his agreeable manners and person, his intelligent\r\nconversation and devotion to herself, had quickly made an impression\r\nupon feelings which, though susceptible, were fastidious, and therefore\r\nstill untouched. Then, too, the romantic ardor with which his attachment\r\nwas expressed, the enthusiasm he manifested for whatever was great,\r\ngood, or beautiful, aroused in Emily all the latent poetry of her\r\nnature. Naturally imaginative, and full even of passionate tenderness,\r\nbut diffident and sensitive, she had hitherto, from an instinctive\r\nconsciousness that they would be misunderstood or disapproved,\r\nstudiously concealed her deeper feelings. Hence had been generated in\r\nher character a degree of thoughtfulness and reserve unusual in one of\r\nher years. Now, however, that she beheld the ideas and aspirations she\r\nhad so long deemed singular, perhaps reprehensible, shadowed forth more\r\npowerfully and definitely by a mind more mature and a spirit more\r\ndaring than her own, her heart responded to its more vigorous\r\ncounterpart; and at the magic touch of sympathy, the long pent-up waters\r\nflowed freely. She loved, was beloved, and asked no more of destiny. It\r\nwas not, it may be supposed, without some reluctance that Colonel\r\nSherwood consented to the demolition of the aerial castles of which his\r\nbeautiful Emily had so long been the subject and the tenant, and made up\r\nhis mind to see her the wife of a man who, though of respectable\r\nparentage, could boast neither title nor pedigree, and was only the\r\njunior partner in a mercantile firm. But then young Hayforth bore the\r\nmost honorable character; his prospects were said to be good, and his\r\nmanners unexceptionable; and, above all, Emily was evidently much\r\nattached to him; and remembering the days of his own early love, the\r\nfather's heart of the aristocratic old colonel was fairly melted, and he\r\nconsented to receive the young merchant as his son-in-law. The marriage,\r\nhowever, was not to take place till the spring of the following year.\r\nMeanwhile the lovers agreed to solace the period of their separation by\r\nlong and frequent letters. Philip's last words to Emily, as he handed\r\nher into the postchaise in which she was to commence her homeward\r\njourney, were, \"Now write to me very often, my own dearest Emily, for I\r\nshall never be happy but when hearing from you or writing to you; and if\r\nyou are long answering my letters, I shall be miserable, and perhaps\r\njealous.\" She could only answer by a mute sign, and the carriage drove\r\naway. Poor, agitated Emily, half happy, half sad, leaned back in it, and\r\nindulged in that feminine luxury--a hearty fit of tears. As for Philip,\r\nhe took a few turns in the park, walking as if for a wager, and feeling\r\nsensible of a sort of coldness and dreariness about every object which\r\nhe had never remarked before. Then he suddenly recollected that he must\r\ngo to the counting-house, as he was \"very busy.\" He did not, however,\r\nmake much progress with his business that day, as somehow or other he\r\nfell into a reverie over every thing he attempted.\r\n\r\nNothing could exceed the regularity of the lovers' correspondence for\r\nthe first two or three months, while their letters were written on the\r\nlargest orthodox sheets to be had from the stationer's--post-office\r\nregulations in those days not admitting of the volumes of little notes\r\nnow so much in vogue. At last Emily bethought herself of working a purse\r\nfor Philip, in acknowledgment of a locket he had lately sent her from\r\nLondon. Generally speaking, Emily was not very fond of work; but somehow\r\nor other no occupation, not even the perusal of a favorite poem or\r\nnovel, had ever afforded her half the pleasure that she derived from the\r\nmanufacture of this purse. Each stitch she netted, each bead she strung,\r\nwas a new source of delight--for she was working for Philip. Love is the\r\ntrue magic of life, effecting more strange metamorphoses than ever did\r\nthe spells of Archimago, or the arts of Armida--the moral alchemy which\r\ncan transmute the basest things into the most precious. It is true of\r\nall circumstances, as well as of personal qualities, that\r\n\r\n    \"Things base and vile, holding no quantity,\r\n    Love can transpose to form and dignity.\"\r\n\r\nThe purse was quickly finished, and dispatched to Philip, together with\r\na letter. Emily was in high spirits at the prospect of the answer. She\r\ndanced about the house, singing snatches of songs and ballads, and\r\ndisplaying an unusual amount of gayety; for, though generally cheerful,\r\nshe was of too thoughtful a disposition to be often merry. Philip, she\r\nwas sure, would write by return of post. How she wished the time were\r\ncome! She knew pretty well, to be sure, what he would say; but what did\r\nthat signify? She longed to feast her eyes on the words his hand had\r\ntraced, and to fancy the tones and the looks which would have\r\naccompanied them had they been spoken instead of written. The expected\r\nday came at last, but the post-bag contained no letter for Emily. At\r\nfirst she could hardly believe it; her countenance fell, and for a few\r\nminutes she seemed much disappointed; but never mind, the letter would\r\ncome to-morrow, and she soon began to trip about and to sing almost as\r\ngayly as before. But another day passed, and another and another, and\r\nstill no letter! Poor Emily's blithe voice was mute now, and her light\r\nstep rarely heard. Sometimes she tried to read, or to play on the piano,\r\nbut without much success; while her anxious looks, and the tear which\r\noccasionally might be seen to glisten in her eye, betrayed the trouble\r\nwithin. A whole week elapsed, a longer period than had ever passed\r\nbefore without a letter from Philip Hayforth--a fortnight--a month--and\r\nthe poor girl's appetite failed, her nights were sleepless, and her\r\ndrooping figure and pining looks told of that anxious suffering, that\r\nweary life-gnawing suspense, which is ten times more hard to bear than\r\nany evil, however great, of which we can ascertain the nature and\r\ndiscern the limits. Could Philip be ill? Could he--No, he could not be\r\ninconstant. Ought she to write to him again? But to this question her\r\nparents answered \"No. It would be unfeminine, unladylike, undignified.\r\nIf Mr. Hayforth were ill, he would doubtless write as soon as he was\r\nable; and if he were well, his conduct was inexcusable, and on Emily's\r\npart rendered any advance impossible.\" Poor Emily shrank from\r\ntransgressing what her parents represented as the limits due to delicacy\r\nand decorum, and she would have died rather than have been guilty of a\r\nreal impropriety, or have appeared unfeminine in the eyes of Philip\r\nHayforth; and yet it did often suggest itself to her mind--rather,\r\nhowever, in the shape of an undefined feeling than of a conscious\r\nthought--that the shortest, best, most straight-forward way of\r\nproceeding, was to write at once to Mr. Hayforth, and ask an\r\nexplanation. She could not herself see clearly how this could be wrong;\r\nbut she supposed it must be so, and she acknowledged her own ignorance\r\nand inexperience. Emily was scarcely twenty; just at the age when an\r\ninquiring and thoughtful mind can no longer rely with the unquestioning\r\nfaith of childhood on assertions sanctioned merely by authority, and\r\nwhen a diffident one is too timid to venture to trust to its own\r\nsuggestions. It is only after much experience, or one of those bitter\r\nmistakes, which are the great lessons of life, that such a character\r\nlearns that self-reliance, exercised with deliberation and humility, is\r\nthe only safeguard for individual rectitude. Emily, therefore, did not\r\nwrite, but lived on in the silent, wasting agony of constant expectation\r\nand perpetual disappointment. Her mother, in the hope of affording her\r\nsome relief, inquired in a letter she was writing to her relative in\r\nLondon, if the latter had lately seen Mr. Hayforth. The answer was like\r\na death-blow to poor Emily. Her mother's correspondent had \"met Mr.\r\nHayforth walking with a lady. He had passed her with a very stiff bow,\r\nand seemed inclined to avoid her. He had not called for a long time. She\r\ncould not at all understand it.\" Colonel Sherwood could now no longer\r\ncontain his indignation. He forbade the mention of Philip Hayforth's\r\nname, declaring that \"his Emily was far too good and beautiful for the\r\nwife of a low-born tradesman, and that he deserved the indignity now\r\nthrown upon his family for ever having thought of degrading it by the\r\npermission of such a union. And his darling child would, he knew, bear\r\nup with the spirit of the Sherwoods.\" Poor Emily had, it is to be\r\nfeared, little of the spirit of the Sherwoods, but she tried to bear up\r\nfrom perhaps as good a motive. But it was a difficult task, for she was\r\nwell-nigh broken-hearted. She now never mentioned Philip Hayforth, and\r\nto all appearance her connection with him was as if it had never been;\r\nbut, waking or sleeping, he was ever present to her thoughts. Oh! was it\r\nindeed possible that she should never, _never_ see him again? No, it\r\ncould not be; he would seek her, claim her yet, her heart said; but\r\nreason whispered that it was madness to think so, and bade her at once\r\nmake up her mind to her inevitable fate. But this she could not do--not\r\nyet at all events. Month after month of the long dreary winter dragged\r\nslowly on; her kind parents tried to dissipate her melancholy by taking\r\nher to every amusement within reach, and she went, partly from\r\nindifference as to what became of her, partly out of gratitude for their\r\nkindness. At last the days began to lengthen, and the weather to\r\nbrighten; but spring flowers and sunny skies brought no corresponding\r\nbloom to the faded hopes and the joyless life of Emily Sherwood. The\r\nonly hope she felt was \"the hope which keeps alive despair.\"\r\n\r\nOne May morning, as she was listlessly looking over in a newspaper the\r\nlist of marriages, her eye fell upon a well-known name--the name of one\r\nwho at that very time ought to have knelt at the altar with her. She\r\nuttered neither scream nor cry, but clasping her hands with one upward\r\nlook of mute despair, fell down in a dead faint. For many days she was\r\nvery ill, and sometimes quite delirious; but her mother tended her with\r\nthe most assiduous affection, while her comfort and recreation seemed\r\nher father's sole care. They were repaid at last by her recovery, and\r\nfrom that time forth she was less miserable. In such a case as Emily's,\r\nthere is not only the shock to the affections, but the terrible wrench\r\nof all the faculties to be overcome, which ensues on the divorce of the\r\nthoughts from those objects and that future to which they have so long\r\nbeen wedded. There is not only the breaking heart to be healed, but the\r\nwhole mental current to be forcibly turned into a different channel from\r\nthat which alone habit has made easy or pleasant. \"The worst,\" as it is\r\ncalled, is, however, easier to be endured than suspense; and if Emily's\r\nspirits did not regain their former elasticity, she ere long became\r\nquite resigned, and comparatively cheerful.\r\n\r\nMore than a year had elapsed since that bright spring morning on which\r\nshe had beheld the irrefragable proof of her lover's perfidy, when she\r\nreceived an offer of marriage from a gentleman, of good family and large\r\nproperty. He had been struck by her beauty at a party where he had seen\r\nher; and after a few meetings, made formal proposals to her father\r\nalmost ere she was aware that he admired her. Much averse to form a new\r\nengagement, she would at once have declined receiving his addresses, had\r\nher parents not earnestly pressed the match as one in every respect\r\nhighly eligible. Overcome at last by their importunities, and having, as\r\nshe thought, no object in existence save to give pleasure to them, she\r\nyielded so far to their wishes as to consent to receive Mr. Beauchamp as\r\nher future husband, on condition that he should be made acquainted with\r\nthe history of her previous engagement, and the present state of her\r\nfeelings. She secretly hoped that when he learned that she had no heart\r\nto give with her hand, he would withdraw his suit. But she was mistaken.\r\nMr. Beauchamp, it is true, knew that there was such a word as _heart_,\r\nhad a notion that it was a term much in vogue with novel-writers, and\r\nwas sometimes mentioned by parsons in their sermons; but that _the\r\nheart_ could have any thing to do with the serious affairs of life never\r\nonce entered into his head to suppose. He therefore testified as much\r\nsatisfaction at Emily's answer, as if she had avowed for him the deepest\r\naffection. They were shortly afterwards married, and the pensive bride\r\naccompanied her husband to her new home--Woodthorpe Hall; an ancient,\r\ncastellated edifice, situated in an extensive and finely-wooded park on\r\nan estate in the East Riding of Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nBut I have too long neglected Philip Hayforth--too long permitted a\r\ncloud to rest upon his honor and constancy. He was not, in truth, the\r\nheartless, light-minded wretch that I fear you may think him. Pride,\r\nnot falsehood or levity, was the blemish in his otherwise fine\r\ncharacter; but it was a very plague-spot, tainting his whole moral\r\nnature, and frequently neutralizing the effect of his best qualities. He\r\nhad been quite as much charmed with Emily's present and Emily's letter,\r\nas she had ever ventured to hope, and had lost not a moment in writing\r\nto her in return a long epistle full of the fervent love and gratitude\r\nwith which his heart was overflowing. He had also mentioned several\r\naffairs of mutual interest and of a pressing nature, but about which he\r\nwas unwilling to take any steps without the concurrence of \"his own\r\ndearest and kindest Emily.\" He therefore entreated her to write\r\nimmediately; \"to write by return of post, if she loved him.\" But this\r\nletter never reached its destination: it was lost--a rare occurrence\r\ncertainly, but, as most of us are aware from our own experience, not\r\nunknown. And now began with Philip Hayforth the same agony which Emily\r\nwas enduring--nay, a greater agony; for there was not only the same\r\ndisappointed affection, the same heart-sickness, the same weary\r\nexpectation, but there was the stronger suffering of a more passionate\r\nand less disciplined temper; and, above all, there was the incessant\r\nstruggle between pride and love--the same fearful strife which, we are\r\ntold, once made war in Heaven.\r\n\r\nSometimes he thought that Emily might be ill; but then that did not seem\r\nlikely, as her health was generally good; and she was, when she had last\r\nwritten, perfectly well, and apparently in excellent spirits. Should he\r\nwrite to her again? No, she owed him a letter, and if she loved him,\r\nwould doubtless answer it as soon as circumstances would permit; and he\r\n'would let that haughty old aristocrat, her father, see that Philip\r\nHayforth, the merchant, had more of the spirit of a man in him than to\r\ncringe to the proudest blood in England. And as for Emily, she was his\r\nbetrothed bride--the same as his wife; and if he was not more to her\r\nthan any father on earth, she was unworthy of the love he had given her.\r\nLet her only be true to him, and he was ready to devote his life to\r\nher--to die for her.' As the time wore slowly away, he became more and\r\nmore exasperated, fevered, wretched. Sometimes it seemed to him that he\r\ncould no longer endure such torment; that life itself was a burthen too\r\nintolerable to be borne. But here pride came to the aid of a better\r\nprinciple. His cheek tinged at the thought of being spoken of as the\r\nslighted lover, and his blood boiled at the bare idea of Colonel\r\nSherwood's contemptuous pity for the vain plebeian who had dared to\r\nraise his thoughts to an alliance with his beautiful, high-born\r\ndaughter. He 'would show the world that he was no love-sick, despairing\r\nswain; and Miss Sherwood's vanity should never be gratified by the\r\ndisplay of the wounds her falsehood had inflicted. He would very soon,\r\nhe knew, forget the fair coquette who had trampled thus upon his most\r\nsacred feelings.' So he tried to persuade himself, but his heart misgave\r\nhim. No: he could not forget her--it was in vain to attempt it; but the\r\nmore his feelings acknowledged her power, even the more the pride she\r\nhad wounded in its tenderest point rose up in wrath against her; and he\r\nchafed at his own powerlessness to testify towards her his scorn and\r\ncontempt. At such times as these he seemed even to himself on the verge\r\nof madness. But he had saner moments--moments when his better nature\r\ntriumphed, and pride resigned for a brief space her stormy empire to the\r\nbenigner sway of the contending passion.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of those terrific tornados, which in the West Indies and\r\nelsewhere carry in their path, over immense districts, ruin and\r\ndesolation, there is a pause, often of considerable duration, caused,\r\nthe scientific inform us, by the calm in the centre of the atmospheric\r\nvortex of which they are composed. Such a calm would occasionally rest\r\nupon the mind of Philip Hayforth, over the length and breadth of which\r\nthe whirlwind of passion had lately been tearing. One night, after one\r\nof those hidden transports, which the proud man would have died rather\r\nthan any mortal eye should have scanned, he threw himself upon his bed\r\n(for he rarely _went to bed_ now, in the accepted sense of the phrase)\r\nin a state approaching exhaustion, mental and bodily. By degrees a sort\r\nof dream-like peace fell upon his spirit; the present vanished away, and\r\nthe past became, as it were, once more a living reality. He thought of\r\nEmily Sherwood as he had first seen her--a vision of loveliness and\r\ngrace. He thought of her as he had beheld her almost the last time on\r\nthat clear summer morning, and like refreshing dew on his scorched and\r\ndesolated heart fell the remembrance of her gentle words and loving\r\nlooks. Could they have deceived? Ah no! and his whole nature seemed\r\nsuddenly softened. He seemed to see her before him now, with her angel\r\nface and her floating white robes; he seemed even yet to be looking into\r\nthose soft, bright eyes, and to read there again, as he had read before,\r\nlove unspeakable, truth unchangeable. His heart was filled with a\r\nyearning tenderness, an intense and longing fondness, and he extended\r\nhis arms, as if to embrace that white-robed image of truth and\r\ngentleness: but she was not there; it was but her spirit which had come\r\nto still his angry passions with the calm of trust and love. And in the\r\nfond superstition that so it was, he sprang from his couch, seized a\r\npen, and wrote to her a passionate, incoherent epistle, telling her that\r\nshe had tried him almost beyond his strength, but that he loved and\r\nbelieved in her still, and if she answered immediately, that he was\r\nready to forgive her for all the pain she had caused him. This letter\r\nfinished, he threw himself upon his bed once again, and after a space,\r\nslept more soundly than he had done for many a long night before. When\r\nhe rose in the morning he read over his letter, and felt, as he read,\r\nsome faint misgivings; but these were put to flight by the recollection\r\nof Emily, as she had appeared to him in the vision of the previous\r\nnight. As the post, however, did not go out till evening, he would keep\r\nthe letter till then. Alas for the delay! It changed for ever his own\r\nfate and that of Emily Sherwood. It chanced that very afternoon that,\r\ntaking up a provincial newspaper in a coffee-room into which he had\r\nstrolled, on his way to the post-office, the following paragraph met his\r\neye:--'We understand that there is a matrimonial alliance in\r\ncontemplation between J---- R----, Esq., eldest son of Sir J---- R----,\r\nBart., and the lovely and accomplished Miss Sherwood, daughter of\r\nColonel Sherwood, late of the --th dragoons, and granddaughter of the\r\nlate R. Sherwood, Esq., of ---- Park.' On reading this most unfounded\r\nrumor, Philip Hayforth waited not another moment, but rushed home as if\r\ndriven by the furies; and tearing his letter in a thousand pieces, threw\r\nit and the purse, Emily's gift, into the fire, and vowed to bestow not\r\nanother thought on the heartless woman who had perjured her own faith\r\nand sold his true and fervent love for riches and title. Oh how he\r\nscorned her! how he felt in his own true heart that all the wealth and\r\ngrandeur of the earth would have been powerless to tempt one thought of\r\nhis from her!\r\n\r\nTo conceal all suspicion of his sufferings from the world, and, if\r\npossible, banish their remembrance from his own mind, he now went even\r\nmore than formerly into society; and when there, simulated a gayety of\r\nmanner that had hitherto distinguished his most vivacious moments. He\r\nhad always been a general favorite, and now his company was more sought\r\nafter than ever. Among the young persons of the opposite sex with whom\r\nhis engagements most frequently brought him in contact, was a young girl\r\nof the name of Fanny Hartley, pretty, gentle, excessively amiable, but\r\nwithout much mind, and with no literary taste whatever. She had nothing\r\nto say, but she listened to him, and he felt in her society a sort of\r\nrepose, which was at present peculiarly grateful to his angry, troubled\r\nspirit. Her very silence soothed him, while the absorbing nature of his\r\nown feelings prevented him at first from thinking of hers. Philip\r\nHayforth had certainly not more than an average share of human vanity,\r\nbut he did at last suspect, partly from an accidental circumstance which\r\nhad first drawn his attention to the subject, that he had created in the\r\nheart of the innocent Fanny a deeper interest than he had ever intended.\r\nHe was touched, grateful, but at first grieved, for _he_ \"could never\r\nlove again.\" But the charm of being loved soon began to work: his heart\r\nwas less desolate, his feelings were less bitter, when he thought of\r\nFanny Hartley, and began to ask himself if he were wise to reject the\r\nconsolation which Providence seemed to offer him in the affection of\r\nthis amiable and artless young creature. And when he thought of the pain\r\nshe might perchance be suffering on his account, all hesitation upon the\r\nsubject was removed at once. If she loved him, as he believed, his\r\nconduct, it seemed to his really kind heart, had already been barbarous.\r\nHe ought not to delay another day. And accordingly that very evening he\r\noffered his hand to Fanny Hartley, and was accepted with trembling joy.\r\n\r\nTheir marriage proved a happy one. Fanny was as amiable as she had\r\nappeared, and in the conduct of the commoner affairs of life,\r\ngood-feeling with her supplied in a great measure any deficiency of\r\nstrong sense. Philip did perhaps occasionally heave a gentle sigh, and\r\nthink for a moment of Emily Sherwood, when he found how incapable his\r\nwife was of responding to a lofty or poetic thought, or of appreciating\r\nthe points of an argument, unless it were upon some such subject as the\r\nmerits of a new dress or the seasoning of a pudding. But he quickly\r\nchecked the rising discontent, for Fanny was so pure in heart, and so\r\nunselfish in disposition, that it was impossible not to respect as well\r\nas to love her. In short, Philip Hayforth was a fortunate man, and what\r\nis more surprising, knew himself to be so. And when, after twenty years\r\nof married life, he saw his faithful, gentle Fanny laid in her grave, he\r\nfelt bereaved indeed. It seemed to him then, as perhaps, at such a time,\r\nit always does to a tender heart, that he had never done her justice,\r\nnever loved her as her surpassing goodness deserved. And yet a kinder\r\nhusband never lived than he had been; and Fanny had died blessing him,\r\nand thanking him, as she said, \"for twenty years of happiness.\" \"How\r\ninfinitely superior,\" he now daily and hourly thought, \"was her sweet\r\ntemper and loving disposition to all the intellect and all the poetry\r\nthat ever were enshrined in the most beautiful form.\" And yet Philip\r\nHayforth certainly was not sorry that his eldest daughter--his pretty,\r\nlively Fanny--should have turned out not only amiable and affectionate,\r\nbut clever and witty. He was, in truth, very proud of Fanny. He loved\r\nall his children most dearly; but Fanny was the apple of his eye--the\r\nvery delight of his existence. He had now almost forgotten Emily\r\nSherwood; but when he did think of her, it was with indifference rather\r\nthan forgiveness. He had not heard of her since his marriage, having,\r\nsome time previous to that event, completely broken off the slight\r\nacquaintance he had formed with her relations; while a short absence\r\nabroad, at the time of her union with Mr. Beauchamp, had prevented him\r\nfrom seeing its announcement in the papers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile poor Emily's married life had not been so happy as that of her\r\nformer lover. Mr. Beauchamp was of a pompous, tyrannical disposition,\r\nand had a small, mean mind. He was constantly worrying about trifles,\r\nperpetually taking offence with nothing, and would spend whole days in\r\ndiscussing some trivial point of etiquette, in the breach of which, he\r\nconceived himself aggrieved. A very miserable woman was his wife amid\r\nall the cold magnificence of her stately home. Often, very often, in\r\nher hours of loneliness and depression, her thoughts would revert to the\r\nbrief, bright days of her early love, and her spirit would be rapt away\r\nby the recollection of that scene on the balcony, when Philip Hayforth\r\nand she had stood with locked hands and full hearts gazing at the\r\nsinking star and the sweetly breaking day, and loving, feeling,\r\nthinking, as if they had but one mind between them, till the present\r\nseemed all a fevered dream, and the past alone reality. She could not\r\nhave been deceived then: then, at least, he had loved her. Oh, had she\r\nnot wronged him? had there not been a mistake--some incident\r\nunexplained? He had warned her that his temper was proud and jealous,\r\nand she felt now that she ought to have written and asked an\r\nexplanation. She had thrown away her happiness, and deserved her fate.\r\nThen she recollected that such thoughts in her, the wife of Mr.\r\nBeauchamp, were worse than foolish--they were sinful; and the\r\nupbraidings of her conscience added to her misery.\r\n\r\nBut Emily had a strong mind, and a lofty sense of right; and in those\r\nsolitary struggles was first developed the depth and strength of her\r\ncharacter. Partly to divert her thoughts from subjects dangerous to her\r\npeace, and partly from the natural bent of her inclinations, she sought\r\nassiduously to cultivate the powers of her mind, while her affections\r\nfound ample scope for their exercise in the love of her infant son, and\r\nin considerate care for her many dependants, by all of whom she was\r\nloved and reverenced in no common degree. She learned thus the grand\r\nlessons--'to suffer and be strong,' and to make the best of destiny; and\r\nshe felt that if she were a sadder woman, she was also a wiser one, and\r\nat any price wisdom, she knew, is a purchase not to be despised.\r\n\r\nMrs. Beauchamp had been married little more than five years when her\r\nhusband died. His will showed, that however unhappy he had made her\r\nduring his life, he had not been insensible to her merit, for he left\r\nher the sole guardian of their only son, and, while she should remain\r\nunmarried, the mistress of Woodthorpe Hall. In the childish affection\r\nand opening mind of her little boy poor Emily at last found\r\nhappiness--unspeakable happiness, although it was of course qualified by\r\nthe anxiety inseparable from parental love. She doted upon him; but her\r\nlove was of too wise and unselfish a nature to permit her to spoil him,\r\nwhile her maternal affection furnished her with another motive for the\r\ncultivation of her own mind and the improvement of her own character.\r\nShe was fired with the noble ambition of being the mother of her child's\r\nmind, as well as of that mind's mere perishable shrine.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years have passed away, with all their changes--their many\r\nchanges; and now,\r\n\r\n    'Gone are the heads of silvery hair,\r\n    And the young that were have a brow of care:'\r\n\r\nAnd the babe of twenty-five years ago is now a man, ready to rush into\r\nthe thickest and the hottest of the great battle of life.\r\n\r\nIt was Christmas time; the trees were bare on Woodthorpe Chase; the\r\nlawns were whitened by a recent shower of snow, and crisped by a sharp\r\nfrost; the stars were coming out in the cold cloudless sky; and two\r\nenormous fires, high piled with Christmas logs, blazed, crackled, and\r\nroared in the huge oaken chimneys of the great oak hall. Mrs. Beauchamp\r\nand her son sat together in the drawing-room, in momentary expectation\r\nof the arrival of their Christmas guests--a party of cousins, who lived\r\nat about ten miles' distance from Woodthorpe Hall. Edmund Beauchamp was\r\nnow a very promising young man, having hitherto fulfilled the hopes and\r\nanswered the cares of his fond and anxious mother. He had already reaped\r\nlaurels at school and college, and his enlightened and liberal views,\r\nand generous, enthusiastic mind, gave earnest of a career alike\r\nhonourable and useful. In person and features, though both were\r\nagreeable, he did not much resemble his mother; but he had the same\r\nlarge, soft, thoughtful eyes, the same outward tranquillity of demeanour\r\nhiding the same earnest spirit. At present he was silent, and seemed\r\nmeditative. Mrs. Beauchamp gazed at him long and fondly, and as she\r\ngazed, her mother's heart swelled with love and pride, and her eyes\r\nglistened with heartfelt joy. At last she remarked, \"I hope the\r\nSharpes's new governess is as nice a person as the old one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, much nicer!\" cried Edmund suddenly, and as if awakening from a\r\nreverie.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! I used to think Miss Smith a very nice person.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, so she was--very good-natured and obliging; but Miss Dalton is\r\naltogether a different sort of person.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder you never told me you found her so agreeable.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--Oh, I did not----That is, you never asked me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she young?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--not much above twenty I should think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she pretty?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I don't exactly know,\" he said, hesitating and colouring; \"I\r\nsuppose--most persons----I should think she is.\" \"How foolish I am!\"\r\nthought Edmund. \"What will my mother think of all this?\" He then\r\ncontinued in a more composed manner--\"She is a very excellent girl at\r\nleast. She is the daughter of a London merchant--a remarkably honourable\r\nman--who has been ruined by these bad times; and though brought up in\r\nluxury, and with the expectation of large fortune, she has conformed to\r\nher circumstances in the most cheerful manner, and supports, it seems,\r\nwith the fruits of her talents and industry, two little sisters at\r\nschool. The Sharpes are all so fond of her, and she is the greatest\r\nfavorite imaginable with the children.\" Edmund spoke with unwonted\r\nwarmth. His mother looked at him half-sympathisingly, half-anxiously.\r\nShe seemed about to speak, when the sound of carriage wheels, and the\r\nloud knock of a footman at the hall-door, announced the arrival of the\r\nSharpes, and Mrs. Beauchamp and her son hastened into the hall to\r\nwelcome their guests. Mrs. Beauchamp's eye sought for the stranger,\r\npartly because she was a stranger, and partly from the interest in her\r\nher son's conversation had created. But Miss Dalton was the last to\r\nenter.\r\n\r\nEdmund had not erred in saying she was a pretty girl. Even beneath the\r\ncumbrous load of cloaks and furs in which she was now enveloped, you\r\ncould detect the exquisite proportions of her _petite_ figure, and the\r\nsprightly grace of her carriage; while a pretty winter bonnet set off to\r\nadvantage a face remarkable for the intelligence and vivacity of its\r\nexpression. Her features, though not regular, were small, while the\r\nbrilliancy of her colour, though her complexion was that of a brunette,\r\nlent a yet brighter glow to her sparkling dark eyes, and contrasted well\r\nwith the glossy black ringlets which shaded her animated countenance. At\r\nthis moment, however, her little head was carried somewhat haughtily,\r\nand there was a sort of something not unlike bashfulness or awkwardness\r\nin her manner which seemed hardly natural to it. The truth was, Miss\r\nDalton had come very unwillingly to share in the festivities of\r\nWoodthorpe Hall. She was not acquainted with Mrs. Beauchamp, and report\r\nsaid she was a very dignified lady, which Fanny Dalton interpreted to\r\nmean a very proud one; and from her change of circumstances, rendered\r\nunduly sensitive, she dreaded in her hostess the haughty neglect or\r\nstill haughtier condescension by which vulgar and shallow minds mark out\r\ntheir sense of another's social inferiority. And therefore it was that\r\nshe held her head so high, and exhibited the constraint of manner to\r\nwhich I have alluded. But all her pride and shyness quickly melted\r\nbefore the benign presence and true heart-politeness of Mrs. Beauchamp.\r\nDignified the latter certainly was; but her dignity was tempered with\r\nthe utmost benevolence of expression, and the most winning sweetness of\r\nmanner; and when she took the hand of her little stranger-guest between\r\nboth of hers, and holding it kindly, said, \"You are the only stranger\r\nhere, Miss Dalton; but for my sake you must try to feel at home,\" an\r\naffection for Mrs. Beauchamp entered into the heart of the young girl,\r\nwhich has continued ever since steadily to increase. That she should\r\nconceive such an affection was not unnatural, for there was something in\r\nthe appearance and manners of Mrs. Beauchamp, combined with her position\r\nin life, calculated to strike the imagination and touch the feelings of\r\na warm-hearted and romantic girl such as Fanny Dalton, more especially\r\none circumstanced as she was. Even her previous prejudice, with the\r\nreaction natural to a generous mind, was likely to heighten her\r\nsubsequent admiration. But it is not so easy to account for the sudden\r\ninterest the pretty governess created at first sight in the heart of her\r\nhostess. Many girls as pretty and as intelligent looking as Miss Dalton\r\nshe had seen before, without their having inspired a spark of the\r\ntenderness she felt towards this unknown stranger. She could not\r\ncomprehend it herself. She was not prone \"to take fancies,\" as the\r\nphrase is; and yet, whatever might be the case, certain it was that\r\nthere was a nameless something about this girl, which seemed to touch\r\none of the deepest chords of her nature, and to cause her heart to yearn\r\ntowards her with something like a mother's love. She felt that if Miss\r\nDalton were all that she had heard, and that if she should really prove\r\nher son's choice, he should not be gainsaid by her.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas party at Woodthorpe Hall was generally a merry one; and\r\nthis year it was even merrier than usual. Fanny Dalton was the life of\r\nthe party; her disposition was naturally a lively one, and this hour of\r\nsunshine in her clouded day called forth all its vivacity. But Fanny was\r\nnot only clever, lively, and amiable; her conduct and manners\r\noccasionally displayed traits of spirit--nay, of pride; the latter,\r\nhowever, of a generous rather than an egotistical description. Nothing\r\nwas so certain to call it forth as any tale of meanness or oppression.\r\nOne morning Miss Sharpe had been relating an anecdote of a gentleman in\r\nthe neighborhood who had jilted (odious word!) an amiable and highly\r\nestimable young lady, to whom he had long been engaged, in order to\r\nmarry a wealthy and titled widow. There were many aggravating\r\ncircumstances attending the whole affair, which had contributed to\r\nexcite still more against the offender the indignation of all\r\nright-thinking persons. The unfortunate young lady was reported to be\r\ndying of a broken heart.\r\n\r\nFanny, who had been all along listening to the narration with an eager\r\nand interested countenance, now exclaimed--\"Dying of a broken heart!\r\nPoor thing! But if I were she, _I_ would not break my heart--I would\r\nscorn him as something far beneath me, poor and unimportant as I am. No,\r\nI might break my heart for the loss of a true lover, but never for the\r\nloss of a false one!\" As Fanny's eyes shone, and her lip curled with a\r\nlofty contempt, as her naturally clear, merry tones grew deeper and\r\nstronger with the indignation she expressed, a mist seemed suddenly to\r\nbe cleared away from the eyes of Mrs. Beauchamp, and in that slight\r\nyoung girl she beheld the breathing image of one whom she had once\r\nintimately known and dearly loved--in those indignant accents she seemed\r\nto recognize the tones of a voice long since heard, but the echoes of\r\nwhich yet lingered in her heart. Why she had so loved Fanny Dalton was\r\nno mystery now--she saw in her but the gentler type of him whom she had\r\nonce believed the master of her destiny--even of Philip Hayforth, long\r\nunheard of, but never forgotten. But what connection could there be\r\nbetween Philip Hayforth and Fanny Dalton? and whence this strange\r\nresemblance, which lay not so much in form or in feature, as in that\r\nnameless, intangible similarity of expression, gesture, manner, and\r\nvoice, so frequently exhibited by members of the same family.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mrs. Beauchamp could quit the table, she withdrew to her own\r\nroom, where she remained for some time in deep meditation, the result of\r\nwhich was a determination to fathom the mystery, if mystery there was.\r\nIt was just possible, too, that the attempt might assist her to find a\r\nkey to the riddle of her own destiny.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the afternoon of the same day, she took an opportunity\r\nof being alone with Miss Dalton and her son, to say to the former--\"I\r\nthink you told me, my dear, that your father was alive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, thank God, _he_ is alive! How I wish you knew him, Mrs.\r\nBeauchamp! I think you would like him, and I am _sure_ he would like and\r\nadmire you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does your father at all resemble you in appearance?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not sure. I have been told that I was like him, and I always\r\nconsider it a great compliment; for papa is still a very handsome man,\r\nand was of course even handsomer when he was young, and before his hair\r\nbecame grey. I have a miniature likeness of him, taken before his\r\nmarriage, which I have with me, and will show you, if you will so far\r\nindulge my vanity.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Beauchamp having replied that she should like exceedingly to see\r\nit, Fanny tripped away, and returned in a few minutes, carrying in her\r\nhand a handsome, but old-fashioned, morocco case. Mrs. Beauchamp had\r\nnever seen it before, but she well remembered having given directions\r\nfor the making of a case of that very size, shape, and color, for a\r\nminiature which was to have been painted for her. Her heart began to\r\nbeat. She seemed upon the brink of a discovery. Fanny now opened the\r\ncase, and placing it before Mrs. Beauchamp, exclaimed, \"Now, isn't he a\r\nhandsome man?\" But Mrs. Beauchamp could not answer. One glance had been\r\nsufficient. A cold mist gathered before her eyes, and she was obliged to\r\nlean for support, upon the back of a chair.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Mrs. Beauchamp, are you ill?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear mother!\" cried Edmund.\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing,\" she answered, quickly recovering herself; \"only a\r\nlittle faintness.\" And then with the self-command which long habit had\r\nmade easy, she sat down and continued with her usual calm sweetness--\"I\r\ncould almost fancy I had seen your father; but I do not remember ever\r\nknowing any one of the name of Dalton but yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but perhaps you might have seen him before he changed his name; and\r\nyet it seems hardly likely. His name used to be Hayforth; but by the\r\nwill of his former partner, who, dying without near relations, left papa\r\nall his money, he took the name of Dalton. The money is all gone now, to\r\nbe sure,\" she continued with the faintest possible sigh; \"but we all\r\nloved the dear old man, and so we still keep his name.\"\r\n\r\nFanny had seated herself beside Mrs. Beauchamp, and as she finished\r\nspeaking, the latter, obeying the impulse of her heart, drew her towards\r\nher and kissed her. Fanny, whose feelings were not only easily touched,\r\nand very strong, but even unusually demonstrative, threw her arms round\r\nMrs. Beauchamp, and cried, with tears in her eyes, \"How kind you are to\r\nme, Mrs. Beauchamp! You could hardly be kinder, if you were my mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear Fanny,\" she answered in a low and affectionate tone, \"I wish,\r\nindeed, I were your mother!\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, Edmund, who had been standing in a window apart, made a\r\nsudden movement towards the two ladies, but as suddenly checked himself.\r\nAt this moment his eyes encountered those of his mother, and colouring\r\nviolently, he abruptly quitted the room. This little scene passed quite\r\nunnoticed by Fanny, who at the instant was thinking only of Mrs.\r\nBeauchamp, and of her own gentle mother, now beneath the sod.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of Philip Hayforth became a frequent guest at Woodthorpe\r\nHall, spending most of her Sundays with Mrs. Beauchamp, who would\r\nfrequently drive over to the Sharpes's for her of a Saturday afternoon,\r\nand send her back on the Monday morning. She was invited to spend the\r\nEaster holidays at the Hall--a most welcome invitation, as she was not\r\nto return home till the midsummer vacation. A most agreeable time were\r\nthese Easter holidays! Never had Fanny seemed more bright and joyous.\r\nHer presence operated as perpetual sunshine on the more pensive natures\r\nof the mother and son. It was therefore a great surprise to Mrs.\r\nBeauchamp when, one day at luncheon, about a week before the time fixed\r\nfor the termination of her visit, Fanny announced her intention of\r\nleaving Woodthorpe that afternoon, if her friend could spare her the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n\"I can certainly spare it, Fanny; but I should like to know the reason\r\nof this sudden determination?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must excuse my telling you, Mrs. Beauchamp; but I hope you will\r\nbelieve me when I say that it is from a sense of duty.\" As she spoke,\r\nshe raised her head with a proud look, her eyes flashed, and she spoke\r\nin the haughty tone which always brought before Mrs. Beauchamp the image\r\nof her early lover; for it was in her proud moments that Fanny most\r\nresembled her father.\r\n\r\n\"Far be it from me, Fanny,\" she replied, with her wonted sweetness and\r\nbenignity, \"to ask any one to tamper with duty; but, my child, our\r\nfaults, our _pride_ frequently mislead us. You shall go to-night, if you\r\nplease; but I wish, for my sake, you could stay at least till to-morrow\r\nmorning. I have not offended you, Fanny?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dearest Mrs. Beauchamp!\" and the poor girl burst into tears. \"I\r\nwish--I _wish_ I could only show you how I love you--how grateful I am\r\nfor all your goodness; but you will never, never know.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Beauchamp looked anxiously at her, and began, \"Fanny\"----But\r\nsuddenly stopped, as if she knew not how to proceed. Immediately\r\nafterwards the young girl left the room, silently and passionately\r\nkissing Mrs. Beauchamp's hand as she passed her on her way to the door.\r\n\r\nA few hours later in the day, as Mrs. Beauchamp sat reading in her\r\nboudoir, according to her custom at that particular hour, Edmund\r\nabruptly entered the little room in a state of agitation quite foreign\r\nto his ordinary disposition and habits.\r\n\r\n\"Mother!\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"My love! what is the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother! I love Fanny Dalton--I love her with all my soul. I think her\r\nnot only the loveliest and most charming of women, but the best and\r\ntruest! I feel that she might make my life not only happier, but better.\r\nOh, mother! is not love as real a thing as either wealth or station? Is\r\nit not as sufficient for all noble works? Is it not in some shape the\r\nonly motive for all real improvement? It seems to me that such is the\r\nlesson I have been learning from you all my life long.\"\r\n\r\n\"And in that you have learned it I am deeply grateful, and far more than\r\nrepaid for all my care and anxiety on your account; and now thank you\r\nfor your confidence, my dear Edmund, though I think you might have\r\nbestowed it after a calmer fashion. It would have been better, I think,\r\nto have said all those violent things to Fanny than to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I _have_ said more than all these to Fanny, and--she has rejected me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Rejected you! my dearest Edmund! I am grieved indeed; but I do not see\r\nhow I can help you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet I should not be quite hopeless if you would plead my cause.\r\nMiss Dalton says that you have loaded her with kindness which she can\r\nnever repay; that she values your affection beyond all expression; and\r\nthat she is determined not to prove herself unworthy of it by being the\r\nmeans of disappointing the expectations you may have formed for your\r\nson, for whom, she says, she is no match either in wealth or station.\r\nShe would not listen to me when I attempted to speak to her but this\r\ninstant in the Laurel Walk, but actually _ran_ away, positively\r\ncommanding me not to follow; and yet, I do think, if she had decidedly\r\ndisliked me, she would have given me to understand so at once, without\r\nmentioning you. Mother! what do _you_--what _do_ you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall hear presently, Edmund; but in the first place let us find\r\nMiss Dalton.\"\r\n\r\nThey went out together, and had not sought her long, when they\r\ndiscovered her pacing perturbedly up and down a broad walk of\r\nclosely-shaven grass, inclosed on both sides by a tall impenetrable\r\nfence of evergreens. As soon as she saw them, she advanced quickly to\r\nmeet them, her face covered with blushes, but her bearing open and\r\nproud. Ere Mrs. Beauchamp had time to speak, she exclaimed, \"Mrs.\r\nBeauchamp, I do not deserve your reproaches. Never till this morning was\r\nI aware of Mr. Beauchamp's sentiments towards me. Dear, kind friend, I\r\nwould have suffered any tortures rather than that this should have\r\nhappened.\"\r\n\r\nFanny was violently agitated; while Mrs. Beauchamp, on the contrary,\r\npreserved a calm exterior. She took one of the young girl's hands\r\nbetween both of hers, and answered soothingly, \"Compose yourself, my\r\ndear Fanny, I entreat you. Believe me, I do not blame you for the\r\naffection my son has conceived for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh thank you! Indeed you only do me justice.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Fanny, I blame you very much for another reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"For what reason, then, madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the same reason which now causes your eye to flash, and makes you\r\ncall your friend by a ceremonious title. I blame you for your _pride_,\r\nwhich has made you think of me harshly and unjustly. Unkind Fanny! What\r\nreason have I ever given you to think me heartless or worldly? Do you\r\nnot know that those who love are equals? and that if it be a more\r\nblessed thing to give, yet to a generous heart, for that very reason, it\r\nought to be a pleasure to receive? Are you too proud, Fanny, to take any\r\nthing from us, or is it because my son's affection is displeasing to you\r\nthat you have rejected him?\"\r\n\r\nFanny was now in tears, and even sobbing aloud. \"Oh, forgive me,\" she\r\ncried, \"forgive me! I acknowledge my fault. I see that what I believed\r\nto be a sense of duty was at least partly pride. Oh, Mrs. Beauchamp, you\r\nwould forgive me if you only knew how miserable I was making myself\r\ntoo!\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you--were you indeed making _yourself_ miserable?\" cried Edmund.\r\n\"Oh say so again, dearest Fanny; and say you are happy now!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Beauchamp smiled fondly as she answered, \"I will do more than\r\nforgive you, my poor Fanny, if you will only love my son. Will you make\r\nus both so happy?\"\r\n\r\nFanny only replied by a rapid glance at Edmund, and by throwing herself\r\ninto the arms of Mrs. Beauchamp, which were extended to receive her. And\r\nas she was pressed to that fond, maternal heart, she whispered audibly,\r\n\"My mother!--our mother!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Beauchamp then taking her hand, and placing it in that of her son,\r\nsaid with evident emotion, \"Only make Edmund happy, Fanny, and all the\r\ngratitude between us will be due on my side; and oh, my children, as you\r\nvalue your future peace, believe in each other through light and\r\ndarkness. And may Heaven bless you both!\" She had turned towards the\r\nhouse, when she looked back to ask, \"Shall I countermand the carriage,\r\nFanny?\" And Edmund added, half-tenderly, half-slyly, \"Shall you go\r\nto-morrow?\"\r\n\r\nFanny's tears were scarcely dry, and her blushes were deeper than ever,\r\nbut she answered immediately, with her usual lively promptitude, \"That\r\ndepends upon the sort of entertainment you may provide as an inducement\r\nto prolong my visit.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Edmund, finding that he had no chance with Fanny where repartee or\r\nbadinage was in question, had recourse again to the serious vein, and\r\nrejoined, \"If my power to induce you to prolong your visit were at all\r\nequal to my will, you would remain for ever, my own dearest Fanny.\"\r\n\r\nWe must now pass over a few months. The early freshness and verdure of\r\nspring had passed away, and the bloom and the glory of summer had\r\ndeparted. The apple-trees were now laden with their rosy treasures, the\r\npeach was ripe on the sunny wall, and the summer darkness of the woods\r\nhad but just begun to be varied by the appearance of a few yellow\r\nleaves. It was on a September afternoon, when the soft light of the\r\nautumn sunset was bathing in its pale golden rays the grey turrets of\r\nWoodthorpe Hall, and resting like a parting smile on the summits of the\r\nancestral oaks and elms, while it cast deep shadows, crossed with bright\r\ngleams, on the spreading lawns, or glanced back from the antlers of the\r\ndeer, as they ever and anon appeared in the hollows of the park or\r\nbetween the trees, that a travelling carriage passed under the old\r\nGothic archway which formed the entrance to Woodthorpe Park, and drove\r\nrapidly towards the Hall. It contained Edmund and Fanny, the\r\nnewly-married pair, who had just returned from a wedding trip to Paris.\r\nThey were not, however, the only occupants of the carriage. With them\r\nwas Mr. Dalton, whom we knew in former days as Philip Hayforth, and who\r\nhad been specially invited by Mrs. Beauchamp to accompany the bride and\r\nbridegroom on their return to Woodthorpe Hall.\r\n\r\nAnd now the carriage stops beneath the porch, and in the arched doorway\r\nstands a noble and graceful figure--the lady of the mansion. The\r\nslanting sunbeams, streaming through the stained windows at the upper\r\nend of the oak hall, played upon her dress of dark and shining silk,\r\nwhich was partly covered by a shawl or mantle of black lace, while her\r\nsweet pale face was lighted up with affection, and her eyes were full of\r\na grave gladness. Her fair hair, just beginning to be streaked with\r\nsilver, was parted over her serene forehead, and above it rested a\r\nsimple matronly cap of finest lace. Emily Beauchamp was still a\r\nbeautiful woman--beautiful even as when in the early prime of youth and\r\nlove she had stood in the light of the new-born day, clad in her robes\r\nof vestal whiteness. The change in her was but the change from morning\r\nto evening--from spring to autumn; and to some hearts the waning light\r\nand the fading leaves have a charm which sunshine and spring-time cannot\r\nboast. Having fondly but hastily embraced her son and daughter, she\r\nturned to Mr. Dalton, and with cordial warmth bade him welcome to\r\nWoodthorpe Hall. He started at the sound of the gentle, earnest tones\r\nwhich, as if by magic, brought palpably before him scenes and images\r\nwhich lay far remote, down the dim vista of years, obscured, almost\r\nhidden, by later interest and more pressing cares. He looked in Mrs.\r\nBeauchamp's face, and a new wonder met him in the glance of her large\r\nbrown eyes, so full of seriousness and benignity, while the smooth white\r\nhand which yet held his in its calm friendly clasp seemed strangely like\r\none he had often pressed, but which had always trembled as he held it.\r\nWhat could all this mean? Was he dreaming? He was aroused from the\r\nreverie into which he had fallen by the same voice which had at first\r\narrested his attention.\r\n\r\n\"We must try to become acquainted as quickly as possible, Mr. Dalton,\"\r\nsaid Mrs. Beauchamp, \"and learn to be friends for our children's sake.\"\r\n\r\nBowing low, he replied, \"I have already learned from my daughter to know\r\nand to esteem Mrs. Beauchamp.\"\r\n\r\nThe more Mr. Dalton saw of Mrs. Beauchamp, the more bewildered he\r\nbecame. He fancied what appeared to him the strangest impossibilities,\r\nand yet he found it impossible to believe that there was no ground for\r\nhis vague conjectures. His life had been one of incessant toil, lately\r\none of heavy distress and anxious cares, which had frequently sent him\r\nto a sleepless pillow; but never had he spent a more wakeful night than\r\nthis, his first under the stately roof which his daughter--his darling\r\nFanny--called that of her home. He felt that he could not endure another\r\nday of this uncertainty. He must be satisfied at all hazards, and he\r\nresolved to make an opportunity, should such not spontaneously present\r\nitself. But he was spared the necessity; for after breakfast the\r\nfollowing morning his hostess offered to show him the grounds--an offer\r\nwhich, with his desired end in view, he eagerly accepted. They commenced\r\ntheir walk in silence, and seemed as if both were suddenly under the\r\ninfluence of some secret spell. At last, in a hoarse voice and a\r\nconstrained manner, Mr. Dalton abruptly inquired, \"Pray, madam, may I\r\nask--though I fear the question may seem an unceremonious, perhaps a\r\nstrange one--if you have any relations of the name of Sherwood?\"\r\n\r\nHe saw her start, as she answered with forced composure, \"Yes, Mr.\r\nDalton, I have. It was indeed my own name before I married.\"\r\n\r\nAs she made this avowal, both stood still, it would seem by a sort of\r\ntacit, mutual consent, and earnestly looked at each other.\r\n\r\nPhilip Hayforth Dalton was now a man past the meridian of life; his once\r\nhandsome and still striking countenance was deeply marked with lines of\r\nsorrow and care, and his dark luxuriant locks were thinned and grizzled,\r\nwhile his features, which had long been schooled to betray no sign of\r\nemotion of a transient or superficial nature, were now, as his eyes met\r\nthose of Mrs. Beauchamp's, convulsed as by the working of a strong\r\npassion. A slight blush tinged Emily's usually pale cheek; she drew a\r\nrapid breath, and her voice faltered perceptibly as she said at last,\r\n\"Yes, Philip Hayforth, I am Emily Sherwood!\"\r\n\r\nNot immediately did he reply either by word or look--not till she had\r\nasked somewhat eagerly, \"We are friends, Mr. Dalton--are we not?\"\r\n\r\nPride wrestled for a minute with the better nature of Philip Hayforth;\r\nbut whether it were that his self-command was now greater than in the\r\nfiery and impassioned season of youth, or that it was difficult to\r\nmaintain anger and resentment in the gentle, soothing, and dignified\r\npresence in which he now found himself, I undertake not to tell; but\r\ncertain it is that this time at least he crushed the old demon down, and\r\nforced himself to answer, though with a formal manner and somewhat harsh\r\ntone, \"Friends, Mrs. Beauchamp! Certainly, we are friends, if _you_ wish\r\nit. Your goodness to my poor motherless Fanny has completely cancelled\r\nall wrongs ever done to Fanny's father. Let the past be forgotten!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so, if you please,\" she answered gently, \"rather let it be\r\nexplained. Mr. Dalton, we are neither of us young now, and have both, I\r\ntrust, outlived the rashness of youth. Never till our mutual truth is\r\nmade mutually clear, can we be the friends we ought to be--the friends I\r\nwish we were for Edmund's and Fanny's sake. Let us both speak plainly\r\nand boldly, and without fear of offence on either side. I promise, on\r\nmine, to take none at the truth, whatever it may be.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dalton, as she spoke, regarded her earnestly and wonderingly,\r\nsaying, as she finished, half in reverie, half addressing her, it would\r\nseem, \"The same clear good sense, the same sweet good temper, which I\r\nhad persuaded myself was but the effect of a delusive imagination! But I\r\nentreat your pardon, madam, and I promise as you have done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me then, truly, Mr. Dalton, why you never answered the last letter\r\nI wrote to you, or acknowledged the receipt of the purse I sent?\"\r\n\r\nHe started, as if he had received a pistol-shot; the formal, distant Mr.\r\nDalton had disappeared, and the eager, vehement Philip Hayforth stood\r\nbefore her once more. \"I did answer it, Emily. Out of the fulness of my\r\nheart--and how full it was I cannot tell you now--I answered your\r\nletter; but you, Emily, you never answered mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I never received it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was some minutes after this announcement ere either was able to\r\nspeak, but at last Mr. Dalton exclaimed, \"Oh how I have wronged you?\r\nEmily, at this instant I catch, as it were, at the bottom of a dark gulf\r\na glimpse of the evil of my nature. I begin to believe that I have\r\ncherished a devil in my bosom, and called it by the name of a good\r\nangel. Emily, if I am not too old to improve, you will have been the\r\ninstrument of my improvement. I do not ask you to forgive me, generous\r\nwoman, because I feel that you have already done so.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Beauchamp felt what it must have cost the proud man to make this\r\nacknowledgment, and she honored him for the effort. \"We have both been\r\nto blame,\" she said, \"and therefore stand in need of mutual forgiveness.\r\nBut it would be idle now to lament the past; rather let us rejoice that\r\nour friendship, re-established on the firm basis of perfect confidence,\r\nis cemented by the union of our dear children.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dalton only answered by offering her his arm, with the kind and\r\nfamiliar politeness of an old friend, as she looked a little fatigued,\r\nand they walked together some distance in silence. At last Mrs.\r\nBeauchamp inquired, \"Was Fanny's mother like herself?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Emily. My poor dead Fanny,\" and his voice trembled slightly, \"was\r\nvery sweet and amiable, but not at all like my living one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your marriage was happy then? I am glad of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have been the most ungrateful of men had it not been so; and\r\nyours too, Emily I hope\"----\r\n\r\nHe stopt, he hardly knew why, while, with her eyes fixed on the ground,\r\nshe answered slowly, \"I am happy, very happy now!\"\r\n\r\nA feeling of profound respect and admiration held Mr. Dalton silent for\r\na few seconds, and then he said, in the tone of one who expresses an\r\nearnest conviction, \"You are the most noble minded woman I ever knew.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Beauchamp made no answer, and it was not till they stood together\r\nin the hall, that she said in her natural tone of kind and calm\r\ncheerfulness, \"And now, Mr. Dalton, let us look for Edmund and Fanny;\r\nand if you please, in order that they may learn of our mistakes that\r\ntrust is the nobler part of love, we shall tell them this story of THE\r\nLOST LETTER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE AT A WATERING-PLACE.\r\n\r\nTHE LIONNE.\r\n\r\nBy Charles Astor Bristed.\r\n\r\nFrom Frazer's Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day at Oldport Springs went off pretty much like another. There was\r\nthe same continual whirl, and flurry, and toiling after pleasure--never\r\nan hour of repose--scarcely enough cessation for the two or three\r\nindispensable meals. When they had walked, and flirted, and played\r\nten-pins, and driven, and danced all day, and all night till two in the\r\nmorning, the women retired to their rooms, and the men retired to the\r\ngambling-house (which being an illegal establishment had, on that\r\naccount, a greater charm in their eyes), and kept it up there till broad\r\ndaylight; notwithstanding which, they always contrived to appear at\r\nbreakfast a few hours after as fresh as ever, and ready to begin the\r\nsame round of dissipation. Indeed it was said that Tom Edwards and his\r\nmost ardent followers among the boys never went to bed at all, but on\r\ntheir return from \"fighting the tiger,\" bathed, changed their linen, and\r\ncame down to the breakfast-room, taking the night's sleep for granted.\r\nIt was a perpetual scene of excitement, relieved only by the heavy and\r\ncalm figure of Sumner, who, silent and unimpassioned, largely capacious\r\nof meat and drink, a recipient of every diversion, without being excited\r\nby any, went through all the bowling, and riding, and polking, and\r\ngambling, with the gravity of a _commis_ performing the national French\r\ndance at the Mabille. There was much rivalry in equipages, especially\r\nbetween Ludlow, Benson, and Loewenberg, who drove the three four-in-hands\r\nof the place, and emulated one another in horses, harness, and\r\nvehicles--even setting up attempts at liveries, in which they found some\r\nimitators (for you can't do any thing in America, however unpopular,\r\nwithout being imitated): and every horse, wagon, man-servant, and\r\nlivery, belonging to every one, was duly chronicled in the Oldport\r\ncorrespondence of the _Sewer_ and the _Jacobin_, which journals were\r\nwont one day to Billingsgate the \"mushroom aristocracy of wealth,\" and\r\nthe next to play Jenkins for their glorification. Le Roi, who owned no\r\nhorses, and had given up dancing as soon as he found that there were\r\nmany of the natives who could out-dance him, and that the late hours\r\nwere bad for his complexion, attached himself to any or every married\r\nlady who was at all distinguished for beauty or fortune; and then went\r\nabout asking, with an ostentatious air of mystery,--_\"Est-ce qu' on\r\nparle beaucoup de moi et Madame Chose?\"_ Sometimes he deigned to turn\r\naside for an heiress; and as he was a very amusing and rather ornamental\r\nman, the girls were always glad to have his company; but the good\r\nspeculations took care not to fall in love with him, or to give him\r\nsufficient encouragement (although a Frenchman does not require a great\r\ndeal) to justify a declaration on his part. Perhaps the legend about the\r\nmutual-benefit subscription club hurt his prospects, or it may have been\r\nhis limited success in dancing. The same reason--as much, at least, as\r\nthe assumed one of their vulgarity--kept Mr. Simpson, and other \"birds\"\r\nof his set, out of the exclusive society. For dancing was the one great\r\narticle in the code of the fashionables to which all other amusements or\r\noccupations were subordinate. There was a grand dress-ball once a week\r\nat one or other of the hotels, and two undress-balls--_hops_ they were\r\ncalled: but most of the exclusives went to these also in full dress, and\r\nboth balls and hops usually lasted till three or four in the morning.\r\nThen on the off-nights \"our set\" got up their own little extempore balls\r\nin the large public parlor, to the music of some volunteer pianist, and\r\nwhen the weather was bad they danced in the same place all day; when it\r\nwas good these informal _matinees_ did not generally last more than two\r\nor three hours. Then there were serenades given about day-break, by\r\nyoung men who were tired of \"the tiger\"--nominally to some particular\r\nladies, but virtually, of course, to the whole hotel, or nearly so--and\r\nthe only music they could devise for these occasions were waltzes or\r\npolkas. Ashburner made a calculation that, counting in the serenades,\r\nthe inhabitants of Oldport were edified by waltz, polka, and redowa\r\nmusic (in those days the _Schottisch_ was not), eleven hours out of the\r\ntwenty-four, daily. And at last, when Mr. Monson, the Cellarius of\r\nNew-York, came down with various dancing-girls, native and imported, to\r\ngive lessons to such aspiring young men as might desire it, first Mrs.\r\nHarrison and other women, who, though wealthy and well-known, were not\r\nexactly \"of us,\" used to drop in to look at the fun; and, finally, all\r\nthe exclusives, irresistibly attracted by the sound of fiddles and\r\nrevolving feet, thronged the little room up-stairs, where the dancing\r\nclass was assembled, and from looking on, proceeded to join in the\r\nexercises. Ladies, beaux, and dancing-girls, were all mingled together,\r\nwhirling and capering about in an apartment fifteen feet square, which\r\nhardly gave them room to pass one another. Benson was the only person\r\nwho entered his protest against the proceeding. He declared it was a\r\nshame that his countrywomen should degrade themselves so before\r\nforeigners; but his expostulations were only laughed at: nor could he\r\neven persuade his wife and sister-in-law to quit the place, though he\r\nstalked off himself in high dudgeon, and wrote a letter to the\r\n_Episcopal Banner_, inveighing against the shameless dissipation of the\r\nwatering-places. For Harry was on very good terms with the religious\r\npeople in New-York, and was professedly a religious man, and had some\r\nsort of idea that he mixed with the fashionables to do them good; which\r\nwas much like what we sometimes hear of a parson who follows the hounds\r\nto keep the sportsmen from swearing, and about as successful. Trying\r\nwith all his might to serve God, and to live with the exclusives, he was\r\nin a fair way to get a terrible fall between two stools.\r\n\r\nTalking of religion brings us naturally to Sunday, which at Oldport was\r\nreally required as a day of rest. But whether it would have been so or\r\nnot is doubtful, only that the Puritan habits of the country made\r\ndancing on that day impossible. It was a violation of public opinion,\r\nand of the actual law of the land, which no one cared to attempt. The\r\nfashionables were thus left almost without resource. The young men went\r\noff to dine somewhere in the vicinity, not unfrequently taking with them\r\nsome of Mr. Monson's dancing-girls; the wearied men, and the women\r\ngenerally, were in a sad state of listlessness. Some of them literally\r\nwent to bed and slept for the rest of the week; others, in very despair\r\nof something to do, went to church and fell asleep there. Ashburner took\r\nadvantage of the lull to fill up his journal, and put down his\r\nobservations on the society about him, in which he had remarked some\r\nstriking peculiarities, apart from the dancing mania and other outward\r\nand open characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that surprised him was the great number of\r\nmisunderstandings and quarrels existing among the not very large number\r\nof people who composed the fashionable set. They seemed to quarrel with\r\ntheir relatives in preference, as a matter of course; and to admit\r\nstrangers very readily to the privilege of relatives. The Robinsons were\r\nat feud with all their cousins: Benson with most of his, except Ludlow.\r\nLudlow, White, Sumner, every man he knew, had his set of private\r\nenemies, with whom he was not on speaking or bowing terms. Mrs.\r\nHarrison, who was very friendly to most of the men, scarcely spoke to a\r\nsingle woman in the place; but this was, perhaps, only carrying the war\r\ninto Africa, as the ladies of \"our set\" generally had intended not to\r\nrecognize her as one of them. These numberless feuds made it very\r\ndifficult to arrange an excursion, or to get up a dinner at the\r\n_restaurant_ of a \"colored gentleman,\" whose timely settlement in\r\nOldport had enabled Mr. Grabster's guests to escape in some measure the\r\npangs of hunger. On studying the cause of these disagreeable\r\nhostilities, he found that, among relatives, they were often caused by\r\ndisputes upon money matters; that between persons not related they\r\nfrequently sprung from the most trivial sources--frivolous points of\r\netiquette, petty squabbles at cards, imaginary jealousies--but that in\r\nboth cases the majority of them could be traced to the all-pervading\r\nspirit of scandal. His purely intellectual education, if it had not made\r\nhim somewhat of a misogynist, had at least prevented him from gaining\r\nany accurate knowledge or appreciation of women: he set them down _en\r\nmasse_ as addicted to gossip, and was not surprised to find in the\r\nAmerican ladies what he assumed as a characteristic of the whole sex.\r\nBut he was surprised to find the same quality so prevalent among the\r\nmen. Not that they were in the habit of killing reputations to give\r\nthemselves _bonnes fortunes_, as Frenchmen might have done under similar\r\ncircumstances; their defamatory gossip was more about men than about\r\nwomen, and seemed to arise partly from a general disbelief in virtue,\r\nand partly from inability to maintain an interesting conversation on\r\nother than personal topics. And though much of this evil speaking was\r\nevidently prompted by personal enmities, much also of it seemed to\r\noriginate in no hostile feeling at all; and it was this that\r\nparticularly astonished Ashburner, to find men speaking disparagingly of\r\ntheir friends--those who were so in the real sense of that much-abused\r\nterm. Thus there could be no reasonable doubt that the cousins, Benson\r\nand Ludlow, were much attached to each other, and fond of each other's\r\nsociety; that either would have been ready to take up the other's\r\nquarrel, or endorse his notes, had circumstances required it. Yet Harry\r\ncould never refrain from laughing before third parties at Gerard's\r\nignorance of books, and making him the hero of all the Mrs.\r\nMalaprop-isms he could pick up or invent; or, as we have seen, speaking\r\nvery disrespectfully of the motives which had led him to commit\r\nmatrimony; and Gerard was not slow to make corresponding comments on\r\nvarious foibles of Harry. But the spirit of detraction was most fully\r\ndeveloped in men who were not professionally idle, but had, or professed\r\nto have, some little business on hand. Of this class was Arthur Sedley,\r\nan old acquaintance and groomsman of Benson, and a barrister--(they are\r\nbeginning to talk about barristers now in New-York, though it is a\r\ndivision of labor not generally recognized in the country)--of some\r\nsmall practice. Really well educated, well read, and naturally clever,\r\nhis cleverness and knowledge were vastly more disagreeable than almost\r\nany amount of ignorance or stupidity could have been. When he cut up\r\nright and left every man or woman who came on the _tapis_, his sarcasms\r\nwere so neatly pointed that it was impossible to help laughing with him;\r\nbut it was equally impossible to escape feeling that, as soon as your\r\nback was turned, he would be laughing at you. Riches and rich people\r\nwere the commonest subject of his sneers, yet he lost no opportunity of\r\ntoadying a profitable connection, and was always supposed to be on the\r\nlook-out for some heiress.\r\n\r\nThe next thing which made Ashburner marvel was the extreme youth of the\r\nfashionable set, particularly the male portion of it; or, to speak more\r\ncritically, the way in which the younger members of the set had\r\nsuppressed their elders, and constituted themselves _the_ society. A\r\nmiddle-aged man, particularly if, like Loewenberg, he happened to be\r\nrich, might be admitted to terms of equality, but the papas and mammas\r\nwere absolutely set aside, and became mere formulas and appendages. The\r\nold people were nowhere; no one looked after their comfort in a crowd,\r\nor consulted them about any arrangement till after the arrangement was\r\nmade. They had no influence and no authority. When Miss Friskin rode a\r\nwild colt bareheaded through the streets of Oldport, or danced the\r\nRedowa with little Robinson in so very _chateau-rouge_ a style that even\r\nMrs. Harrison turned away, poor Mrs. Friskin could interpose no\r\nimpediment to the young lady's amusement; and even her father, the\r\nrespected senior of the wealthy firm, Friskin & Co., who must have heard\r\nfrom afar of his daughter's vagaries (for all these things were written\r\nin the note-book of the _Sewer_), seemed never to have dreamed of the\r\npropriety or possibility of coming up to Oldport to put a stop to them.\r\nWhen Tom Edwards was squandering his fortune night after night at the\r\nfaro-table, and his health day after day in ceaseless dissipation, there\r\nwas no old friend of his family who dared to give him advice or warning,\r\nfor there was none to whose advice or warning he would have listened.\r\nOnce when Ashburner was conversing with Benson on some subject which\r\nbrought on a reference to this inverse order of things, the latter gave\r\nhis explanation of it, which was to this effect:--\r\n\r\n\"The number of foreigners among us, either travelling for pleasure or\r\nsettled for purposes of business, is so great that they become an\r\nappreciable element in our society. It is, therefore, requisite that a\r\nfashionable should be able to associate easily with foreigners; and for\r\nthis it is necessary that he or she should have some knowledge of\r\nforeign customs and languages, and, in the first place, of the French\r\nlanguage. Now, if we go back a generation, we shall find that the men of\r\nthat day were not educated to speak French. Go into the Senate Chamber\r\nat Washington, for instance, and you will not meet with many of the\r\nhonorable senators who can converse in the recognized language of\r\ncourts. Many of our most distinguished statesmen and _diplomats_ can\r\nspeak no tongue but their own. And to descend to private life, with\r\nwhich we have more particularly to do, when a foreigner presents himself\r\nwith his letters at the dwelling of an old city merchant or professional\r\nman, it is generally the younger branches of the family who are called\r\non to amuse him and play interpreters for the rest. This gives the young\r\npeople a very decided advantage over their elders, and it is not\r\nsurprising that they have become a little vain of it. And similarly with\r\nregard to foreign dresses, dances, cookery, and habits generally. The\r\nyoung men, having been the latest abroad, are the freshest and best\r\ninformed in these things. It does not require any great experience or\r\nwisdom to master them, only some personal grace and aptitude for\r\nimitation to start with, and an _a plomb_ to which ignorance is more\r\nconducive than knowledge. Hence the standard of excellence has become\r\none of superficial accomplishment, and the man of matured mind who\r\nenters into competition with these handsome, showy, and illiterate boys,\r\nputs himself at a discount. Look at Loewenberg. All his literary\r\nacquirements and artistic tastes (and he really has a great deal of\r\nboth) go for nothing. The little beaux can speak nearly as many\r\nlanguages as he can, and dance and dress better. The only thing they can\r\nappreciate about him is his money, and the horses and dinners consequent\r\nthereon. If little Robinson, there, with his _ne plus ultra_ tie and\r\nvarnished shoes, were to have the same fortune left him to-morrow, he\r\nwould be the better man of the two, because he can polk better, and\r\nbecause, being neither a married man nor the agent of a respectable\r\nhouse, he can gamble and do other things which Loewenberg's position does\r\nnot allow him to do.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a great confession for Benson to make against the country;\r\nnevertheless, it was not perfectly satisfactory to Ashburner, who\r\nthought that it did not explain all the phenomena of the case. It seemed\r\nto him that there was at work a radical spirit of insubordination, and a\r\nprinciple of overturning the formerly recognized order of domestic rule.\r\nThe little children ate and drank what they liked, went to bed when they\r\nliked, and altogether were very independent of their natural rulers.\r\nBenson's boy rode rough-shod over his nurse, bullied his mother, and\r\nonly deigned to mind his father occasionally. The wives ruled their\r\nhusbands despotically, and acted as if they had taken out a patent for\r\navenging the inferiority of their sex in other parts of the world.\r\nBenson did not like dancing: he only danced at all because he thought it\r\nhis business to know a little of every thing, and because society\r\nthought it the duty of every young man who was not lame to understand\r\nthe polka. But his wife kept him going at every ball for six hours,\r\nduring five of which he was bored to death. Ludlow, whose luxurious\r\nliving made violent exercise necessary for his health, and who,\r\ntherefore, delighted in fencing, boxing, and \"constitutionals\" that\r\nwould have tired a Cantab, was made to drive about Mrs. Ludlow all day\r\ntill he hated the sight of his own horses. As to Mrs. Harrison, she\r\ntreated her husband, when he made his appearance at Oldport (which was\r\nnot very often) as unceremoniously as one would an old trunk, or any\r\nother piece of baggage which is never alluded to or taken notice of\r\nexcept when wanted for immediate use.\r\n\r\nAshburner first met this lady a very few days after his arrival at\r\nOldport; indeed, she was so conspicuous a figure in the place that one\r\ncould not be there long without taking notice of her. About mid-day\r\nthere was usually a brief interval between the ten-pin bowling and the\r\ninformal dance; and during one of these pauses he perceived on the\r\nsmoking-piazza where ladies seldom ventured, a well-dressed and rather\r\nhandsome woman smoking a cigarette, and surrounded by a group of beaux\r\nof all sizes, from men like White and Sumner to the little huge-cravated\r\nboys in their teens. She numbered in her train at least half-a-dozen of\r\nthese cavaliers, and was playing them off against one another and\r\nmanaging them all at once, as a circus-rider does his four horses, or a\r\njuggler his four balls. In a country where beauty is the rule rather\r\nthan the exception, she was not a remarkable beauty--at least, she did\r\nnot appear such to Ashburner, from that distance; nor was her dress,\r\nthough sufficiently elegant and becoming, quite so artistically put on\r\nas that of Mrs. Benson and the other belles of the set; still there was\r\nclearly something very attractive and striking about her, and he was\r\nimmediately induced to inquire her name, and, on learning that she was a\r\nreal lady (though not of \"our set\" of ladies), to request an\r\nintroduction to her. But Benson, to whom he first applied, instead of\r\njumping at the opportunity with his usual readiness to execute or\r\nanticipate his friend's wishes, boggled exceedingly, and put off the\r\nintroduction under frivolous and evidently feigned pretences. It was so\r\nuncommon for Benson to show any diffidence in such matters, and his\r\nwhole air said so plainly, \"I will do this out of friendship for you if\r\nyou wish it, but for my own part I would rather not,\" that Ashburner\r\nsaw there was something in the wind, and let the subject drop. Ludlow,\r\nto whom he next had recourse, told him, with the utmost politeness but\r\nin very decided terms, that \"his family\" (he was careful not to insist\r\non his own personality in the affair) \"had not the honor of Mrs.\r\nHarrison's acquaintance.\" The next man who happened to come along was\r\nMr. Simpson, and to him Ashburner made application, thinking that,\r\nperhaps, the fair smoker might more properly belong to the \"second set,\"\r\nthough so surrounded by the beaux of the first. But even Simpson, though\r\nthe last man in the world to be guilty of any superfluous delicacy,\r\nhesitated very much, and made some allusion to Mrs. Simpson; and then\r\nAshburner began to comprehend the real state of the case,--that most of\r\nthe married women had declared war against Mrs. Harrison, that she had\r\nretaliated upon them all, and that the husbands were drawn into their\r\nwives' quarrels, and obliged to fight shy of her before strangers. It\r\nwas clear, then, that he must apply to a bachelor; and accordingly he\r\nwaylaid Sumner, who \"was too happy\" to introduce him at once in due\r\nform.\r\n\r\nAs Ashburner came up to Mrs. Harrison she began to play off her eyes at\r\nhim, and he then perceived that they constituted her chief beauty. They\r\nwere of that deep blue which, in certain lights, passes for\r\nblack,--large, expressive, and pleasing; the sort of eyes that go right\r\nthrough a man and look him down to nothing. Indeed, they had such effect\r\non him that he lost all distinctive idea of her other features. Her\r\nmanner, too, had something very attractive, though he could not have\r\ndefined wherein it consisted. She did not exhibit the _empressement_\r\nwith which most of her countrywomen seek to put a stranger at his ease\r\nat once; or the _exigence_ of a spoiled lady waiting to be amused; or\r\nthe haughtiness of a great lady, who does not care if she is amused\r\nherself and deigns no effort to amuse others. Neither did she attack him\r\nwith raillery and irony, as Mrs. Benson had done on their first meeting.\r\nBut she behaved as if she were used to seeing men like Ashburner every\r\nday of her life, and was willing to meet them half-way and be agreeable\r\nto them, if they were so to her, without taking any particular trouble,\r\nfor there was no appearance of effort to please, or even of any strong\r\ndesire to please, in her words and gestures; yet she _did_ please and\r\nattract very decidedly.\r\n\r\n\"So I saw you in Mrs. Harrison's train!\" said Benson, when they next\r\nmet.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I fancy I know why you hesitated to introduce me.\"\r\n\r\nAs Ashburner spoke he glanced towards the parlor, where \"our set\"--Mrs.\r\nBenson, of course, conspicuous among them--were engaged in their\r\nordinary occupation of dancing.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I assure you, _madame_ is not disposed to be jealous, nor am I a\r\nman to take part in women's quarrels. I don't like the lady myself, to\r\nbegin with; and were I a bachelor, should have as little to say to her\r\nas I have now. In the first place she is too old----\"\r\n\r\n\"Too old! she cannot be thirty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course a lady never _is_ thirty, until she is fifty, at least; but\r\nat any rate I may say, without sacrilege, that Mrs. H. is pretty high up\r\nin the twenties. Now, at that age a woman ought--not to give up society,\r\nthat would be an absurdity in the other extreme, but--to leave the\r\nromping dances and the young men to the girls, who want them more and\r\nwhom they become better. Then I don't like her face. You must have taken\r\nnotice that all the upper part of it is fine and intellectual, and she\r\nhas glorious eyes----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Ashburner.\r\n\r\n\"But all the lower part is heavy and over-sensuous. Now, not only does\r\nthis, in my opinion, entirely disfigure a woman's looks, but it suggests\r\nunpleasant ideas of her character. A man may have that ponderous chin\r\nand voluptuous mouth, without their disturbing the harmony of an\r\notherwise handsome face. I do not think a woman can; and as in the\r\nphysical so in the moral. A man can stand a much greater amount of\r\nsensuousness in his composition than a woman. I do not mean to allude to\r\nthe different standards of morality for the two sexes admitted by\r\nsociety; for I don't admit it, and think it very unjust; and I am proud\r\nto say that our people generally entertain more virtuous as well as more\r\nequitable views on this point than the Europeans. I mean literally that\r\na man having so many opportunities for leading an active life, and being\r\nable to reason himself into or out of a great many things to or from\r\nwhich a woman's only guide is her feelings, may be very sensuous without\r\nits doing any positive harm to himself or others; but with a woman, who\r\nis compelled to lead a comparatively idle life, such an element\r\npredominating in her character is sure to bring her into mischief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say, then, that----\" and Ashburner stopped short, but\r\nhis look implied the remainder of his interrupted question.\r\n\r\n\"Do you ask me from a personal motive?\"\r\n\r\nAshburner colored, and was proceeding to disclaim any such motive with\r\nan air of injured innocence.\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't mean any thing of the sort,\" said Benson, who felt that he\r\nhad gone rather too far, and might unintentionally have slandered his\r\ncountrywoman. \"I believe the lady is as pure as--as my wife, or any one\r\nelse. The number of her beaux, and the equality with which she treats\r\nthem, prove conclusively to my mind that her flirting never runs into\r\nany thing worse. I don't think a woman runs any danger of that kind when\r\nshe has such a lot of cavaliers; they keep watch on her and on one\r\nanother. I remember when my brother lived in town, he once was away from\r\nhome for two or three weeks, and when he came back an old maid who lived\r\nin his street, and used to keep religious watch over the goings-out and\r\ncomings-in of every one in the vicinity, said to him, \"How very gay\r\nyour wife is, Mr. Benson! she has been walking with a different\r\ngentleman every day since you were gone.' 'Dear me!' says Carl; 'a\r\ndifferent man every day! How glad I am! If you had told me she was\r\nwalking with the _same_ man every day I might have been a little\r\nscared.' But a woman may be perfectly chaste herself, and yet cause a\r\ngreat deal of unchasteness in other people. Here is this Mrs. Harrison,\r\nsmoking cigarettes--and cigars, too, sometimes, in the open air;\r\ndrinking grog at night, and sometimes in the morning; letting Tom\r\nEdwards and the foolish boys who imitate him talk slang to her without\r\nputting them down; always ready for a walk or drive with the last\r\nhandsome young man who has arrived; and utterly ignoring her husband,\r\nexcept when she makes some slighting mention of him for not sending her\r\nmoney enough: what is the effect of all this upon the men? The\r\nforeigners; there are plenty of them here every season; I wonder there\r\nare so few this time: instead of one decent Frenchman like Le Roi, you\r\nusually find half-a-dozen disreputable ones; Englishmen many, not always\r\nof the best sort; Germans, Russians, and Spaniards, occasionally: they\r\nall are inclined to look upon her--especially considering her\r\nbelligerent attitude towards the rest of the female population--as\r\nsomething _tres legere_, and to attempt to go a little too far with her.\r\nThen she puts them down fast enough, and they in spite say things about\r\nher, the discredit of which extends to our ladies generally--in short,\r\nshe exposes the country before foreigners. Then for the natives, she\r\ncatches some poor boy just loose upon the world, dances with, flatters\r\nhim--for she has a knack of flattering people without seeming to do so,\r\nespecially by always appearing to take an interest in what is said to\r\nher,--keeps him dangling about her for a while; then some day he says or\r\ndoes something to make a fool of himself, and she extinguishes him. The\r\nman gets a check of this sort at his entry into society that is enough\r\nto make him a misogynist for life. And the little scenes that she used\r\nto get up last summer with married men, just to make their wives\r\njealous!\"\r\n\r\n\"Which, I suppose, is the reason none of your wives will let you speak\r\nto her?\" said Ashburner, who began to feel, he hardly knew why, a\r\nsentiment of partisanship for Mrs. Harrison. \"But granting that her\r\nface, as you describe it, is an index of her character, I should draw\r\nfrom that exactly the opposite inference. I believe that the women who\r\nmake mischief in the way you mention are your unsensuous and passionless\r\nones--that the perfect flirt, single or married, must be a perfectly\r\ncold woman, because it is only one of such a temperament who can thus\r\ntrifle with others without danger to herself. I speak hesitatingly, for\r\nall women are a mystery, and my experience is as yet very limited; but\r\nsuch opportunities of observation as have fallen to my lot confirm me in\r\nthe theory.\"\r\n\r\nSomewhat to Ashburner's surprise his friend made no attempt to\r\ncontrovert his argument. He only turned it aside, saying,----\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't like her, at any rate. If I had no other reason, the way\r\nshe talks of her husband would be enough to make me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there _is_ a Mr. Harrison, then? One hears so little of him----\"\r\n\r\n\"And sees so nothing of him, you may say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly--that I took him for a mythological personage--a cousin of our\r\nMrs. Harris.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless I assure you Mr. Harrison exists very decidedly--a\r\nWall-street speculator, and well known as such by business people, a\r\ncapital man behind a trotter, an excellent judge of wine. Probably he\r\nwill come here from the city once or twice before we leave, and I shall\r\nfind an opportunity to introduce you to him, for he is really worth\r\nknowing and considerable of a man, as we say--no fool at all, except in\r\nthe way he lets his wife bully him.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he made an unsuitable match that does not show his wisdom\r\nconspicuously.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was an unsuitable match enough, Heaven knows! But when he proposed\r\nhe was in the state of mind in which sensible people do the most foolish\r\nthings. He was a great man in stocks--controlled the market at one\r\ntime--had been buying largely just before the election of '44, when we\r\nall expected Henry Clay would get in with plenty to spare. When Polk was\r\nelected, great was the terror of all respectable citizens. My brother\r\ncaught such a fright then that I don't think he has fairly recovered\r\nfrom it to this day. How the stocks did tumble down! Harrison had about\r\nnine millions on his hands; he couldn't keep such a fund, and was forced\r\nto sell at any price, and lost just one third. Just as he was beginning\r\nto pick himself up after the shock and wonder, like the sailor whom the\r\nconjurer blew up, what was to come next? Mr. Whitey of the _Jacobin_,\r\nnow the honorable Pompey Whitey--and one doesn't see why he shouldn't\r\nbe, for after all an editor is not, generally speaking, a greater\r\nblackguard than most of our Congressmen--Whitey, I say, who for our sins\r\nis nominally attached to the Conservative party, conceived the bright\r\nidea of overbidding the enemy for popular favor, and proposed--no, he\r\ndidn't actually propose in so many words, but only strongly hinted at\r\nthe desirableness of the measure--that there should be no more paying\r\nrent, and a general division of property. I am not sure but there were\r\nsome additional suggestions on the expediency of abolishing the\r\nChristian religion and the institution of matrimony, but that has\r\nnothing to do with politics. This last drop in the bucket quite\r\noverflowed poor Harrison; so, as if he had said to himself, \"Let us eat\r\nand drink and get married, for to-morrow we shall have a proscription\r\nand _novae tabulae_,\" he rushed off and proposed to Miss Macintyre.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, if she accepted him after he lost his fortune, it shows she did\r\nnot marry for money, at any rate.\"\r\n\r\n\"There you have missed it. He lost the whole of _a_ fortune, but not the\r\nwhole of _his_. He must have a million of dollars left, and a man with\r\nthat is not poor in any country--certainly it was a great catch for Miss\r\nMacintyre, without a red cent of her own. She jilted a Frenchman for\r\nhim: the unfortunate, or fortunate cast-off had ordered much jewelry and\r\nother wedding presents, and when left in the lurch he quietly proposed\r\nthat, as he had no longer any use for the articles, Harrison, who had,\r\nshould take them off his hands; and this offer was accepted. Very French\r\nin him to make it--don't you think so?--and rather American in the other\r\nto take it. Well, I hope Harrison will come this way soon; I should\r\nreally like you to know him.\"\r\n\r\nOne or two days after this conversation Ashburner met his friend walking\r\nup and down the interminable piazza of the Bath Hotel, arm-in-arm with a\r\nmiddle-aged man, who presented as great a contrast to Benson's usual\r\nassociates, and to Benson himself, as could well be imagined. The\r\nnew-comer was short of stature and square-built, rather ugly, and any\r\nthing but graceful; he wore very good clothes, but they were badly put\r\non, and looked as if they had never undergone the brush since leaving\r\nthe tailor's hands; he wore no gloves, and in short had altogether an\r\nunfashionable appearance. But though indubitably an unfashionable man,\r\nhe did not give you the impression of a vulgar one; there was nothing\r\nsnobbish or pretentious in his ugliness, and his cavernous black eye\r\ncould have belonged only to an intelligent and able man. Benson was\r\njoking or pressing upon him some matter which he seemed unwilling to\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\n\"But do tell me,\" said Harry, as they passed Ashburner, \"what _have_ you\r\nbeen doing to yourself? Sprained your finger by working too hard the\r\nnight before last packet day? or tumbled down from running too fast in\r\nWall-street, and not thinking which way you were going?\" And he took in\r\nhis own delicate white hand the rough paw of the stranger, which was\r\npartly bound up as if suffering from some recent injury.\r\n\r\n\"If you must know,\" said the other, stopping short his walk, \"I broke my\r\nknuckles on an Irish hackman's teeth. Last week the fellow drove me from\r\nthe North River boat to my house in Union Square, and I offered him\r\nseventy-five cents. He was very insolent and demanded a dollar. If I had\r\nhad a dollar-note about me I might have given it to him, but it happened\r\nthat I had only the six shillings in change; and so, knowing that was\r\ntwo shillings more than his legal fare, I became as positive as he. At\r\nlast he seized my trunk, and then I could not resist the temptation of\r\ngiving him a left-hander that sent him clean down the steps into the\r\ngutter.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\r\n\r\n\"He made a great bawling, and was beginning to draw a crowd about the\r\nhouse, when I walked off to the nearest police-station; and as it turned\r\nout that my gentleman was known as a troublesome character, they\r\nthreatened to take away his license and have him sent to Blackwell's\r\nIsland if he didn't keep quiet; so he was too glad to make himself\r\nscarce.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, you deserve a testimonial from the city! I once got twenty\r\ndollars damages from an omnibus-driver for running into my brougham,\r\nknocking off a wheel, and dumping my wife and child into the street; and\r\nI thought it was a great exploit, but this performance of yours throws\r\nme into the shade.\"\r\n\r\nJust then Benson caught sight of Ashburner, and excusing himself to the\r\nother, rushed up to him.\r\n\r\n\"Let me tell you now, before I forget it. We are going over to the glen\r\nto-morrow to dine, and in fact spend the day there. You'll come, of\r\ncourse?\"\r\n\r\n\"With great pleasure,\" said Ashburner; \"but pray don't let me take you\r\naway from your friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's only Harrison.\"\r\n\r\nWe meant, of course, our set, with such foreign lions as the place\r\nafforded, foremost among whom stood Ashburner and Le Roi. Benson,\r\nLudlow, and some of the other married men undertook to arrange it,\r\nalways under the auspices of the Robinsons.\r\n\r\nThese Robinsons were evidently the leaders in every movement of the\r\nfashionables, but why they were so was not so clear--at least, to\r\nAshburner, though he had abundant opportunities of studying the whole\r\nfamily. There was a father in some kind of business, who occupied the\r\nusual position of New-York fathers; that is to say, he made the money\r\nfor the rest of the family to spend, and showed himself at Oldport once\r\na fortnight or so--possibly to pay the bills. There was a mother, stout\r\nand good-humored, rather vulgar, very fussy, and no end of a talker: she\r\nalways reminded Ashburner of an ex-lady-mayoress. There were three or\r\nfour young men, sons and cousins, with the usual amount of white tie and\r\nthe ordinary dexterity in the polka; and two daughters, both well out of\r\ntheir teens. The knowing ones said that one of these young ladies was to\r\nhave six thousand a year by her grandfather's will, and the other little\r\nor nothing; but it was not generally understood which was the heiress,\r\nand the old lady manoeuvred with them as if _both_ were. This fact,\r\nhowever, was not sufficient to account for their rank as _belles_, since\r\nthere were several other girls in their circle quite as well, or better\r\noff. Nor had their wit or talent any share in giving them their\r\nposition; on the contrary, people used to laugh at the _betises_ of the\r\nRobinsons, and make them the butt of real or imaginary good stories.\r\nAnd, in point of birth, they were not related to the Van Hornes, the\r\nBensons, the Vanderlyns, or any of the old Dutch settlers; nor like\r\nWhite Ludlow, and others of their set, sprung from the British families\r\nof long standing in the city. On the very morning of the proposed\r\nexcursion Sedley was sneering at them for _parvenus_, and trying to\r\namuse Ashburner at their expense with some ridiculous stories about\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" said the Englishman, \"these people are your leaders of\r\nfashion. You can't do any thing without them. They are the head of this\r\nexcursion that we are just going upon.\" Benson tells me \"the Robinsons\r\nare to be there,\" as if that settled the propriety and desirability of\r\nmy being there also.\"\r\n\r\n\"As to that,\" replied Sedley, \"fashionable society is a vast absurdity\r\nanywhere, and it is only natural that absurd people should be at the\r\nhead of it. The Robinsons want to be fashionable--it is their only\r\nambition--they try hard for it; and it is generally the case that those\r\nwho devote themselves to any pursuit have some success in it, and only\r\nright that it should be so. Then they are hopelessly good-natured folks,\r\nthat you can't insult or quarrel with.\" Sedley had so little of this\r\nquality himself that he looked on the possession of it as a weakness\r\nrather than a virtue. \"Then they are very fond of good living.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I remember hearing Benson say that he always liked to feed Mrs.\r\nRobinson at a ball,--it was a perfect pleasure to see her eat; and that\r\nwhen Loewenberg, in the pride of his heart, gave a three-days'\r\n_dejeuner_, or lunch, or whatever it was, after his marriage, she was\r\nseen there three times each day.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he might have told you that they are as liberal of their own good\r\nthings as fond of those of others. Old Robinson has some first-rate\r\nMadeira, better by a long chalk than that Vanderlyn Sercial that Harry\r\nBenson is always cramming down your throat--metaphorically, I mean, not\r\nliterally. The young men like to drop in there of an evening, for they\r\nare sure to find a good supper and plenty of materials ready for punch\r\nand polka. Then they always manage to catch the newest lions. When I\r\nfirst saw you in their carriage along-side of Miss Julia, I said to\r\nmyself, \"That Englishman must be somebody, or the Robinsons would not\r\nhave laid hold of him so soon.\" But their two seasons in Paris were the\r\nmaking of them,--and the unmaking, too, in another sense; for they ate\r\nsuch a hole in their fortune--or, rather, their French guests did for\r\nthem--that it has never recovered its original dimensions to this day.\r\nThey took a grand hotel, and gave magnificent balls, and filled their\r\nrooms with the Parisian aristocracy. My uncle, who is an _habitue_ of\r\nParis, was at the Jockey Club one day, and heard two exquisites talking\r\nabout them. \"_Connaissez-vous ce Monsieur Robinson?_\" asked one.\r\n\"_Est-ce que je le connais!_\" replied the other, shrugging his\r\nshoulders. \"_Je mange ses diners, je danse a ses bals; v'la tout.\" Voila\r\ntout_, indeed! That is just all our people get by keeping open house for\r\nforeigners.\"\r\n\r\nJust then Benson and Ludlow came up, the former under much excitement,\r\nand the latter in a sad state of profanity. As they both insisted on\r\ntalking at once, it was some time before either was intelligible; at\r\nlength Ashburner made out that the excursion had met with a double\r\ncheck. In the first place, all the bachelors had demanded that Mrs.\r\nHarrison should be of the party, in which they were sustained by\r\nLoewenberg, who, though partly naturalized by his marriage, still\r\nconsidered himself sufficiently a stranger to be above all spirit of\r\nclique. All the other married men had objected, but the Harrisonites\r\nultimately carried their point. Of the two principal opponents, Ludlow\r\nwas fairly talked off his feet by the voluble _patois_ of Loewenberg, and\r\nBenson completely put down by the laconic and inflexible Sumner. So far\r\nso bad, but worse was to follow; for after the horses had been ordered,\r\nand most of the ladies, including the Robinsons, bonneted and shawled\r\nfor the start, the _lionne_, who had, doubtless, heard of the\r\nunsuccessful attempt to blackball her, and wished to make a further\r\ntrial of her power, suddenly professed a headache, whereupon her\r\npartisans almost unanimously declared that, as she couldn't go, they\r\ndidn't want to go; and thus the whole affair had fallen through. Such\r\nwas the substance of their melancholy intelligence, which they had\r\nhardly finished communicating when a _dea ex machina_ appeared in the\r\nperson of Mrs. Benson. She declared that it was \"a shame,\" and \"too\r\nbad,\" and she \"had never,\" &c.; and brought her remarks to a practical\r\nconclusion by vowing that _she_ would go, at any rate, whoever chose to\r\nstay with that woman; \"and if no one else goes with us I'm sure Mr.\r\nAshburner will:\" at which Ashburner was fain to express his readiness to\r\nfollow her to the end of the world, if necessary. Then she followed up\r\nher advantage by sending a message to Sumner, which took him captive\r\nimmediately; and as she was well seconded by the Robinsons, who on their\r\npart had brought over Le Roi, the party was soon reorganized pretty much\r\non its original footing. When the cause of all the trouble found herself\r\nlikely to be left in a minority her headache vanished immediately, in\r\ntime for her to secure beaux enough to fill her barouche, and Mr.\r\nHarrison was put into a carriage with the musicians. Mrs. Benson's\r\nvehicle was equally well filled; and Harry, who, by his wife's orders,\r\nand much against his own will, had lent his wagon and ponies to a young\r\nSoutherner that was doing the amiable to Miss Vanderlyn, had nothing\r\nleft for it but to go on horseback; in which Ashburner undertook to join\r\nhim, having heard that there was a good bit of turf on the road to the\r\nglen.\r\n\r\n\"If you go that way,\" said Mrs. Robinson, when he announced his\r\nintention, \"you will have another companion. Mr. Edwards means to ride.\"\r\n\r\nAshburner had seen Edwards driving a magnificent trotter about Oldport,\r\nbut could not exactly fancy him outside of a horse, and conjectured that\r\nhe would not make quite so good a figure as when leading the redowa down\r\na long ball-room. But the hero of the dance was not forthcoming for\r\nsome time, so they mounted, Benson his pet Charlie, and the Englishman\r\nthe best horse the stables of Oldport could furnish, which it is hardly\r\nnecessary to say was not too good a one, and were leaving the village\r\nleisurely to give the carriages a good start of them, when they heard\r\nclose behind the patter of a light-stepping horse, and the next moment\r\nTom Edwards ranged up along side. The little man rode a bright bay mare,\r\nrising above fifteen hands, nearly full-blooded, but stepping steadily\r\nand evenly, without any of that fidget and constant change of gait which\r\nrenders so many blood-horses any thing but agreeable to ride, and\r\ncarrying her head and tail to perfection. He wore white cord trousers, a\r\nbuff waistcoat, and a very natty white hair-cloth cap. His coat was\r\nsomething between a summer sack and a cutaway,--the color, a rich green\r\nof some peculiar and indescribable shade. His spurs were very small, but\r\nhighly polished; and, instead of a whip, he carried a little red cane\r\nwith a carved ivory head. In his marvellously fitting white buckskin\r\nglove he managed a rein of some mysterious substance that looked like a\r\ncompound of india-rubber and sea-weed. He sat his mare beautifully--with\r\na little too much aim at effect, perhaps; but gracefully and firmly at\r\nthe same time. Ashburner glanced at his own poor beast and wished for\r\nDaredevil, whose antics he had frequently controlled with great success\r\nat Devilshoof; and Benson could not help looking a little mortified, for\r\nCharlie was not very well off for tail, and had recollections of his\r\nharness days, which made him drop his head at times and pull like a\r\nsteam engine; besides which, Harry--partly, perhaps, from motives of\r\neconomy, partly, as he said, because he thought it snobbish to ride in\r\nhandsome toggery--always mounted in the oldest clothes he had, and with\r\na well-used bridle and saddle. But there was no help for it now, so off\r\nthe three went together at a fair trot, and soon overtook most of the\r\nparty, Edwards putting his spurs into the bay mare and showing off her\r\npoints and his horsemanship at every successive vehicle they passed.\r\n\r\nThe piece of turf which Benson had promised his friend was not quite so\r\nsmooth as Newmarket heath, but it was more than three-quarters of a mile\r\nlong, and sufficiently level to be a great improvement on the heavy and\r\nsandy road. So unaccustomed, however, are Americans to \"riding on\r\ngrass,\" that Edwards could not be persuaded to quit the main path until\r\nBenson had repeatedly challenged him to a trot on the green. As soon as\r\nthe two horses were fairly along-side they went off, without waiting the\r\nsignal from their riders, at a pace which kept Ashburner at a\r\nhand-gallop. For awhile they were neck-and-neck, Benson and Charlie\r\nhauling against each other, the rider with his weight thrown back in the\r\nstirrups and laboring to keep his \"fast crab\" from breaking, while the\r\nmare struck out beautifully with a moderate pull of the rein. Then as\r\nBenson, who carried no whip, began to get his horse more in hand, he\r\nraised a series of yells in true jockey fashion, to encourage his own\r\nanimal and to break up Edwards's. The mare skipped--Tom caught her in an\r\ninstant, but she fell off in her stroke from being held up, and Charlie\r\nheaded her a length; then he gave her her head, and she broke--once,\r\ntwice, three times; and every time Benson drew in his horse, who was now\r\nwell settled down to his work, and waited for Edwards to come on. At\r\nlast, his mare and he both lost their tempers at once. She started for a\r\nrun, and he dropped the reins on her back and let her go. At the same\r\ninstant Benson stuck both spurs into Charlie, who was a rare combination\r\nof trotter and runner, and away went the two at full gallop. Ashburner's\r\nhack was left behind at once, but he could see them going on close\r\ntogether, tooling their horses capitally; Edwards's riding, being the\r\nmore graceful, and Benson's the more workmanlike; the mare leading a\r\ntrifle, as he thought, and Charlie pressing her close. Suddenly Edwards\r\nwaved his cane as in triumph, but the next moment he and his mare\r\ndisappeared, as if the earth had swallowed them up, while Benson's horse\r\nsheered off ten feet to the left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ONE IN AFFLICTION.\r\n\r\nBy John R.

No voice of the Parson's,\r\ncharmed he ever so wisely, could persuade the peasant boy to go and ask\r\npardon of the young gentleman, to whom, because he had done as he was\r\nbid, he owed an agonizing defeat and a shameful incarceration. And, to\r\nMrs. Dale's vexation, the widow took the boy's part. She was deeply\r\noffended at the unjust disgrace Lenny had undergone in being put in the\r\nstocks; she shared his pride, and openly approved his spirit. Nor was it\r\nwithout great difficulty that Lenny could be induced to resume his\r\nlessons at school; nay, even to set foot beyond the precincts of his\r\nmother's holding. The point of the school at last he yielded, though\r\nsullenly; and the Parson thought it better to temporize as to the more\r\nunpalatable demand. Unluckily Lenny's apprehensions of the mockery that\r\nawaited him in the merciless world of his village were realized. Though\r\nStirn at first kept his own counsel, the Tinker blabbed the whole\r\naffair. And after the search instituted for Lenny on the fatal night,\r\nall attempt to hush up what had passed would have been impossible. So\r\nthen Stirn told his story, as the Tinker had told his own; both tales\r\nwere very unfavorable to Leonard Fairfield. The pattern boy had broken\r\nthe Sabbath, fought with his betters, and been well mauled into the\r\nbargain; the village lad had sided with Stirn and the authorities in\r\nspying out the misdemeanors of his equals; therefore Leonard Fairfield,\r\nin both capacities of degraded pattern boy and baffled spy, could expect\r\nno mercy;--he was ridiculed in the one, and hated in the other.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, in the presence of the schoolmaster, and under the eye\r\nof Mr. Dale, no one openly gave vent to malignant feelings; but the\r\nmoment those checks were removed, popular persecution began.\r\n\r\nSome pointed and mowed at him; some cursed him for a sneak, and all\r\nshunned his society; voices were heard in the hedgerows, as he passed\r\nthrough the village at dusk, \"Who was put in the stocks?--baa!\" \"Who got\r\na bloody nob for playing spy to Nick Stirn?--baa!\" To resist this\r\nspecies of aggression would have been a vain attempt for a wiser head\r\nand a colder temper than our poor pattern boy's. He took his resolution\r\nat once, and his mother approved it; and the second or third day after\r\nDr. Riccabocca's return to the Casino, Lenny Fairfield presented himself\r\non the terrace with a little bundle in his hand. \"Please, sir,\" said he\r\nto the Doctor, who was sitting cross-legged on the balustrade, with his\r\nred silk umbrella over his head.\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, if you'll be good enough to take me now, and give me any\r\nhole to sleep in, I'll work for your honor night and day; and as for the\r\nwages, mother says 'just suit yourself, sir.'\"\r\n\r\n\"My child,\" said the Doctor, taking Lenny by the hand, and looking at\r\nhim with the sagacious eye of a wizard, \"I knew you would come! and\r\nGiacomo is already prepared for you! As to wages, we'll talk of them\r\nby-and-by.\"\r\n\r\nLenny being thus settled, his mother looked for some evenings on the\r\nvacant chair, where he had so long sate in the place of her beloved\r\nMark; and the chair seemed so comfortless and desolate, thus left all to\r\nitself, that she could bear it no longer.\r\n\r\nIndeed the village had grown as distasteful to her as to Lenny--perhaps\r\nmore so; and one morning she hailed the Steward as he was trotting his\r\nhog-maned cob beside the door, and bade him tell the Squire that \"she\r\nwould take it very kind if he would let her off the six months' notice\r\nfor the land and premises she held--there were plenty to step into the\r\nplace at a much better rent.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a fool,\" said the good-natured Steward; \"and I'm very glad you\r\ndid not speak to that fellow Stirn instead of to me. You've been doing\r\nextremely well here, and have the place, I may say, for nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothin' as to rent, sir, but a great deal as to feeling,\" said the\r\nwidow. \"And now Lenny has gone to work with the foreign gentleman, I\r\nshould like to go and live near him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes--I heard Lenny had taken himself off to the Casino--more fool\r\nhe; but, bless your heart, 'tis no distance--two miles or so. Can't he\r\ncome home every night after work?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" exclaimed the widow almost fiercely; \"he shan't come home\r\nhere, to be called bad names and jeered at!--he whom my dead good man\r\nwas so fond and proud of. No, sir; we poor folks have our feelings, as I\r\nsaid to Mrs. Dale, and as I will say to the Squire hisself. Not that I\r\ndon't thank him for all favors--he be a good gentleman if let alone; but\r\nhe says he won't come near us till Lenny goes and axes pardin. Pardin\r\nfor what, I should like to know? Poor lamb! I wish you could ha' seen\r\nhis nose, sir--as big as your two fists. Ax pardin! If the Squire had\r\nhad such a nose as that, I don't think it's pardin he'd been ha' axing.\r\nBut I let's the passion get the better of me--I humbly beg you'll excuse\r\nit, sir. I'm no scollard, as poor Mark was, and Lenny would have been,\r\nif the Lord had not visited us otherways. Therefore just get the Squire\r\nto let me go as soon as may be; and as for the bit o' hay and what's on\r\nthe grounds and orchard, the new-comer will no doubt settle that.\"\r\n\r\nThe Steward, finding no eloquence of his could induce the widow to\r\nrelinquish her resolution, took her message to the Squire. Mr.\r\nHazeldean, who was indeed really offended at the boy's obstinate refusal\r\nto make the _amende honorable_ to Randal Leslie, at first only bestowed\r\na hearty curse or two on the pride and ingratitude both of mother and\r\nson. It may be supposed, however, that his second thoughts were more\r\ngentle, since that evening, though he did not go himself to the widow,\r\nhe sent his \"Harry.\" Now, though Harry was sometimes austere and\r\n_brusque_ enough on her own account, and in such business as might\r\nespecially be transacted between herself and the cottagers, yet she\r\nnever appeared as the delegate of her lord except in the capacity of a\r\nherald-of-peace and mediating angel. It was with good heart, too, that\r\nshe undertook this mission, since, as we have seen, both mother and son\r\nwere great favorites of hers. She entered the cottage with the\r\nfriendliest beam in her bright blue eye, and it was with the softest\r\ntone of her frank cordial voice that she accosted the widow. But she was\r\nno more successful than the Steward had been. The truth is, that I don't\r\nbelieve the haughtiest duke in the three kingdoms is really so proud as\r\nyour plain English rural peasant, nor half so hard to propitiate and\r\ndeal with when his sense of dignity is ruffled. Nor are there many of my\r\nown literary brethren (thin-skinned creatures though we are) so\r\nsensitively alive to the Public Opinion, wisely despised by Dr.\r\nRiccabocca, as the same peasant. He can endure a good deal of contumely\r\nsometimes, it is true, from his superiors, (though, thank Heaven! _that_\r\nhe rarely meets with unjustly;) but to be looked down upon, and mocked,\r\nand pointed at by his own equals--his own little world--cuts him to the\r\nsoul. And if you can succeed in breaking his pride, and destroying this\r\nsensitiveness, then he is a lost being. He can never recover his\r\nself-esteem, and you have chucked him half way--a stolid, inert, sullen\r\nvictim--to the perdition of the prison or the convict-ship.\r\n\r\nOf this stuff was the nature both of the widow and her son. Had the\r\nhoney of Plato flowed from the tongue of Mrs. Hazeldean, it could not\r\nhave turned into sweetness the bitter spirit upon which it descended.\r\nBut Mrs. Hazeldean, though an excellent woman, was rather a bluff,\r\nplain-spoken one--and, after all, she had some little feeling for the\r\nson of a gentleman, and a decayed fallen gentleman, who, even by Lenny's\r\naccount, had been assailed without any intelligible provocation; nor\r\ncould she, with her strong common sense, attach all the importance which\r\nMrs. Fairfield did to the unmannerly impertinence of a few young cubs,\r\nwhich she said truly, \"would soon die away if no notice was taken of\r\nit.\" The widow's mind was made up, and Mrs. Hazeldean departed--with\r\nmuch chagrin and some displeasure.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fairfield, however, tacitly understood that the request she had\r\nmade was granted, and early one morning her door was found locked--the\r\nkey left at a neighbor's to be given to the Steward; and, on farther\r\ninquiry, it was ascertained that her furniture and effects had been\r\nremoved by the errand-cart in the dead of the night. Lenny had succeeded\r\nin finding a cottage, on the road-side, not far from the Casino; and\r\nthere, with a joyous face, he waited to welcome his mother to breakfast,\r\nand show how he had spent the night in arranging her furniture.\r\n\r\n\"Parson!\" cried the Squire, when all this news came upon him, as he was\r\nwalking arm-in-arm with Mr. Dale to inspect some proposed improvement in\r\nthe Alms-house, \"this is all your fault. Why did not you go and talk to\r\nthat brute of a boy, and that dolt of a woman? You've got 'soft sawder\r\nenough,' as Frank calls it in his new-fashioned slang.\"\r\n\r\n\"As if I had not talked myself hoarse to both!\" said the Parson in a\r\ntone of reproachful surprise at the accusation. \"But it was in vain! O\r\nSquire, if you had taken my advice about the stocks--_quieta non\r\nmovere_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bother!\" said the Squire. \"I suppose I am to be held up as a tyrant, a\r\nNero, a Richard the Third, or a Grand Inquisitor, merely for having\r\nthings smart and tidy! Stocks indeed!--your friend Rickeybockey said he\r\nwas never more comfortable in his life--quite enjoyed sitting there. And\r\nwhat did not hurt Rickeybockey's dignity (a very gentlemanlike man he\r\nis, when he pleases) ought to be no such great matter to Master Leonard\r\nFairfield. But 'tis no use talking! What's to be done now? The woman\r\nmust not starve; and I'm sure she can't live out of Rickeybockey's wages\r\nto Lenny--(by the way, I hope he don't board him upon his and Jackeymo's\r\nleavings: I hear they dine upon newts and sticklebacks--faugh!) I'll\r\ntell you what, Parson, now I think of it--at the back of the cottage\r\nwhich she has taken there are some fields of capital land just vacant.\r\nRickeybockey wants to have 'em, and sounded me as to the rent when he\r\nwas at the Hall. I only half promised him the refusal. And he must give\r\nup four or five acres of the best land round the cottage to the\r\nwidow--just enough for her to manage--and she can keep a dairy. If she\r\nwant capital, I'll lend her some in your name--only don't tell Stirn;\r\nand as for the rent--we'll talk of that when we see how she gets on,\r\nthankless obstinate jade that she is! You see,\" added the Squire, as if\r\nhe felt there was some apology due for this generosity to an object whom\r\nhe professed to consider so ungrateful, \"her husband was a faithful\r\nservant, and so--I wish you would not stand there staring me out of\r\ncountenance, but go down to the woman at once, or Stirn will have let\r\nthe land to Rickeybockey, as sure as a gun. And hark ye, Dale, perhaps\r\nyou can contrive, if the woman is so cursedly stiff-backed, not to say\r\nthe land is mine, or that it is any favor I want to do her--or, in\r\nshort, manage it as you can for the best.\" Still even this charitable\r\nmessage failed. The widow knew that the land was the Squire's, and worth\r\na good L3 an acre. \"She thanked him humbly for that and all favors; but\r\nshe could not afford to buy cows, and she did not wish to be beholden\r\nto any one for her living. And Lenny was well off at Mr.\r\nRickeybockey's, and coming on wonderfully in the garden way--and she did\r\nnot doubt she could get some washing; at all events, her haystack would\r\nbring in a good bit of money, and she should do nicely, thank their\r\nhonors.\"\r\n\r\nNothing farther could be done in the direct way, but the remark about\r\nthe washing suggested some mode of indirectly benefiting the widow. And\r\na little time afterwards, the sole laundress in that immediate\r\nneighborhood happening to die, a hint from the Squire obtained from the\r\nlandlady of the inn opposite the Casino such custom as she had to\r\nbestow, which at times was not inconsiderable. And what with Lenny's\r\nwages, (whatever that mysterious item might be,) the mother and son\r\ncontrived to live without exhibiting any of those physical signs of fast\r\nand abstinence which Riccabocca and his valet gratuitously afforded to\r\nthe student in animal anatomy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nOf all the wares and commodities in exchange and barter, wherein so\r\nmainly consists the civilization of our modern world, there is not one\r\nwhich is so carefully weighed--so accurately measured--so plumbed and\r\ngauged--so doled and scraped--so poured out in _minima_ and balanced\r\nwith scruples--as that necessary of social commerce called \"an apology!\"\r\nIf the chemists were half so careful in vending their poisons, there\r\nwould be a notable diminution in the yearly average of victims to\r\narsenic and oxalic acid. But, alas, in the matter of apology, it is not\r\nfrom the excess of the dose, but the timid, niggardly, miserly manner in\r\nwhich it is dispensed, that poor humanity is hurried off to the Styx!\r\nHow many times does a life depend on the exact proportions of an\r\napology! Is it a hairbreadth too short to cover the scratch for which\r\nyou want it? Make your will--you are a dead man! A life do I say?--a\r\nhecatomb of lives! How many wars would have been prevented, how many\r\nthrones would be standing, dynasties flourishing--commonwealths brawling\r\nround a _bema_, or fitting out galleys for corn and cotton--if an inch\r\nor two more of apology had been added to the proffered ell! But then\r\nthat plagy, jealous, suspicious, old vinegar-faced Honor, and her\r\npartner Pride--as penny-wise and pound-foolish a she-skinflint as\r\nherself--have the monopoly of the article. And what with the time they\r\nlose in adjusting their spectacles, hunting in the precise shelf for the\r\nprecise quality demanded, then (quality found) the haggling as to\r\nquantum--considering whether it should be Apothecary's weight or\r\nAvoirdupois, or English measure or Flemish--and, finally, the hullaboloo\r\nthey make if the customer is not perfectly satisfied with the monstrous\r\nlittle he gets for his money,--I don't wonder, for my part, how one\r\nloses temper and patience, and sends Pride, Honor, and Apology, all to\r\nthe devil. Aristophanes, in his \"Comedy of _Peace_\" insinuates a\r\nbeautiful allegory by only suffering that goddess, though in fact she is\r\nhis heroine, to appear as a mute. She takes care never to open her lips.\r\nThe shrewd Greek knew very well that she would cease to be Peace, if she\r\nonce began to chatter. Wherefore, O reader, if ever you find your pump\r\nunder the iron heel of another man's boot, heaven grant that you may\r\nhold your tongue, and not make things past all endurance and forgiveness\r\nby bawling out for an apology!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nBut the Squire and his son, Frank, were large-hearted generous creatures\r\nin the article of apology, as in all things less skimpingly dealt out.\r\nAnd seeing that Leonard Fairfield would offer no plaister to Randal\r\nLeslie, they made amends for his stinginess by their own prodigality.\r\nThe Squire accompanied his son to Rood Hall, and none of the family\r\nchoosing to be at home, the Squire in his own hand, and from his own\r\nhead, indited and composed an epistle which might have satisfied all the\r\nwounds which the dignity of the Leslies had ever received.\r\n\r\nThis letter of apology ended with a hearty request that Randall would\r\ncome and spend a few days with his son. Frank's epistle was to the same\r\npurport, only more Etonian and less legible.\r\n\r\nIt was some days before Randall's replies to these epistles were\r\nreceived. The replies bore the address of a village near London, and\r\nstated that the writer was now reading with a tutor preparatory to\r\nentrance at Oxford, and could not, therefore, accept the invitation\r\nextended to him.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, Randall expressed himself with good sense, though not with\r\nmuch generosity, he excused his participation in the vulgarity of such a\r\nconflict by a bitter but short allusion to the obstinacy and ignorance\r\nof the village boor; and did not do what you, my kind reader, certainly\r\nwould have done under similar circumstances--viz. intercede in behalf of\r\na brave and unfortunate antagonist. Most of us like a foe better after\r\nwe have fought him--that is, if we are the conquering party; this was\r\nnot the case with Randal Leslie. There, so far as the Etonian was\r\nconcerned, the matter rested. And the Squire, irritated that he could\r\nnot repair whatever wrong that young gentleman had sustained, no longer\r\nfelt a pang of regret as he passed by Mrs. Fairfield's deserted cottage.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nLenny Fairfield continued to give great satisfaction to his new\r\nemployers, and to profit in many respects by the familiar kindness with\r\nwhich he was treated. Riccabocca, who valued himself on penetrating into\r\ncharacter, had from the first seen that much stuff of no common quality\r\nand texture was to be found in the disposition and mind of the English\r\nvillage boy. On farther acquaintance, he perceived that, under a\r\nchild's innocent simplicity, there were the workings of an acuteness\r\nthat required but development and direction. He ascertained that the\r\npattern boy's progress at the village school proceeded from something\r\nmore than mechanical docility and readiness of comprehension. Lenny had\r\na keen thirst for knowledge, and through all the disadvantages of and\r\ncircumstance, there were the indications of that natural genius which\r\nconverts disadvantages themselves into stimulants. Still, with the germs\r\nof good qualities lay the embryos of those which, difficult to separate,\r\nand hard to destroy, often mar the produce of the soil. With a\r\nremarkable and generous pride in self-repute, there was some\r\nstubbornness; with great sensibility to kindness, there was also strong\r\nreluctance to forgive affront.\r\n\r\nThis mixed nature in an uncultivated peasant's breast interested\r\nRiccabocca, who, though long secluded from the commerce of mankind,\r\nstill looked upon man as the most various and entertaining volume which\r\nphilosophical research can explore. He soon accustomed the boy to the\r\ntone of a conversation generally subtle and suggestive; and Lenny's\r\nlanguage and ideas became insensibly less rustic and more refined. Then\r\nRiccabocca selected from his library, small as it was, books that,\r\nthough elementary, were of a higher cast than Lenny could have found\r\nwithin his reach at Hazeldean. Riccabocca knew the English language\r\nwell, better in grammar, construction, and genius than many a not\r\nill-educated Englishman; for he had studied it with the minuteness with\r\nwhich a scholar studies a dead language, and amidst his collection he\r\nhad many of the books which had formerly served him for that purpose.\r\nThese were the first works he had lent to Lenny. Meanwhile Jackeymo\r\nimparted to the boy many secrets in practical gardening and minute\r\nhusbandry, for at that day farming in England (some favored counties and\r\nestates excepted) was far below the nicety to which the art has been\r\nimmemorially carried in the north of Italy--where, indeed, you may\r\ntravel for miles and miles as through a series of market-gardens--so\r\nthat, all these things considered, Leonard Fairfield might be said to\r\nhave made a change for the better. Yet in truth, and looking below the\r\nsurface, that might be fair matter of doubt. For the same reason which\r\nhad induced the boy to fly his native village, he no longer repaired to\r\nthe church of Hazeldean. The old intimate intercourse between him and\r\nthe Parson became necessarily suspended, or bounded to an occasional\r\nkindly visit from the father--visits which grew more rare, and less\r\nfamiliar, as he found his former pupil in no want of his services, and\r\nwholly deaf to his mild entreaties to forget and forgive the past, and\r\ncome at least to his old seat in the parish church. Lenny still went to\r\nchurch--a church a long way off in another parish--but the sermons did\r\nnot do him the same good as Parson Dale's had done; and the clergyman,\r\nwho had his own flock to attend to, did not condescend, as Parson Dale\r\nwould have done, to explain what seemed obscure, and enforce what was\r\nprofitable, in private talk, with that stray lamb from another's fold.\r\n\r\nNow I question much if all Dr. Riccabocca's sage maxims, though they\r\nwere often very moral, and generally very wise, served to expand the\r\npeasant boy's native good qualities, and correct his bad, half so well\r\nas the few simple words, not at all indebted to Machiavelli, which\r\nLeonard had once reverently listened to when he stood by his father's\r\nchair, yielded up for the moment to the good Parson, worthy to sit in\r\nit; for Mr. Dale had a heart in which all the fatherless of the parish\r\nfound their place. Nor was this loss of tender, intimate, spiritual love\r\nso counterbalanced by the greater facilities for purely intellectual\r\ninstruction, as modern enlightenment might presume. For, without\r\ndisputing the advantage of knowledge in a general way, knowledge, in\r\nitself, is not friendly to content. Its tendency, of course, is to\r\nincrease the desires, to dissatisfy us with what is, in order to urge\r\nprogress to what may be; and, in that progress, what unnoticed martyrs\r\namong the many must fall, baffled and crushed by the way! To how large a\r\nnumber will be given desires they will never realize, dissatisfaction of\r\nthe lot from which they will never rise! _Allons!_ one is viewing the\r\ndark side of the question. It is all the fault of that confounded\r\nRiccabocca, who has already caused Lenny Fairfield to lean gloomily on\r\nhis spade, and, after looking round and seeing no one near him, groan\r\nout querulously--\r\n\r\n\"And am I born to dig a potato ground?\"\r\n\r\n_Pardieu_, my friend Lenny, if you live to be seventy, and ride in your\r\ncarriage;--and by the help of a dinner-pill digest a spoonful of curry,\r\nyou may sigh to think what a relish there was in potatoes, roasted in\r\nashes after you had digged them out of that ground with your own stout\r\nyoung hands. Dig on, Lenny Fairfield, dig on! Dr. Riccabocca will tell\r\nyou that there was once an illustrious personage[R] who made experience\r\nof two very different occupations--one was ruling men, the other was\r\nplanting cabbages; he thought planting cabbages much the pleasanter of\r\nthe two!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nDr. Riccabocca had secured Lenny Fairfield, and might therefore be\r\nconsidered to have ridden his hobby in the great whirligig with\r\nadroitness and success. But Miss Jemima was still driving round in her\r\ncar, bundling the reins, and flourishing the whip, without apparently\r\nhaving got an inch nearer to the flying form of Dr. Riccabocca.\r\n\r\nIndeed, that excellent and only too susceptible spinster, with all her\r\nexperience of the villany of man, had never conceived the wretch to be\r\nso thoroughly beyond the reach of redemption as when Dr. Riccabocca took\r\nhis leave, and once more interred himself amidst the solitudes of the\r\nCasino, without having made any formal renunciation of his criminal\r\ncelibacy. For some days she shut herself up in her own chamber, and\r\nbrooded with more than her usual gloomy satisfaction on the certainty of\r\nthe approaching crash. Indeed, many signs of that universal calamity\r\nwhich, while the visit of Riccabocca lasted, she had permitted herself\r\nto consider ambiguous, now became luminously apparent. Even the\r\nnewspaper, which during that credulous and happy period had given half a\r\ncolumn to births and marriages, now bore an ominously long catalogue of\r\ndeaths; so that it seemed as if the whole population had lost heart, and\r\nhad no chance of repairing its daily losses. The leading articles spoke,\r\nwith the obscurity of a Pythian, of an impending CRISIS. Monstrous\r\nturnips sprouted out from the paragraphs devoted to general news. Cows\r\nbore calves with two heads, whales were stranded in the Humber, showers\r\nof frogs descended in the High-street of Cheltenham.\r\n\r\nAll these symptoms of the world's decrepitude and consummation, which by\r\nthe side of the fascinating Riccabocca might admit of some doubt is to\r\ntheir origin and cause, now, conjoined with the worst of all, viz.--the\r\nfrightfully progressive wickedness of man--left to Miss Jemima no ray of\r\nhope save that afforded by the reflection that she could contemplate the\r\nwreck of matter without a single sentiment of regret.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale, however, by no means shared the despondency of her fair\r\nfriend, and, having gained access to Miss Jemima's chamber, succeeded,\r\nthough not without difficulty, in her kindly attempts to cheer the\r\ndrooping spirits of that female philanthropist. Nor, in her benevolent\r\ndesire to speed the car of Miss Jemima to its hymenial goal, was Mrs.\r\nDale so cruel towards her male friend, Dr. Riccabocca, as she seemed to\r\nher husband. For Mrs. Dale was a woman of shrewdness and penetration, as\r\nmost quick-tempered women are; and she knew that Miss Jemima was one of\r\nthose excellent young ladies who are likely to value a husband in\r\nproportion to the difficulty of obtaining him. In fact, my readers of\r\nboth sexes must often have met, in the course of their experience, with\r\nthat peculiar sort of feminine disposition, which requires the warmth of\r\nthe conjugal hearth to develop all its native good qualities; nor is it\r\nto be blamed over-much if, innocently aware of this tendency in its\r\nnature, it turns towards what is best fitted for its growth and\r\nimprovement, by laws akin to those which make the sun-flower turn to the\r\nsun or the willow to the stream. Ladies of this disposition, permanently\r\nthwarted in their affectionate bias, gradually languish away into\r\nintellectual inanition, or sprout out into those abnormal eccentricities\r\nwhich are classed under the general name of \"oddity\" or \"character.\"\r\nBut, once admitted to their proper soil, it is astonishing what\r\nhealthful improvement takes place--how the poor heart, before starved\r\nand stinted of nourishment, throws out its suckers, and bursts into\r\nbloom and fruit. And thus many a belle from whom the beaux have stood\r\naloof, only because the puppies think she could be had for the asking,\r\nthey see afterwards settled down into true wife and fond mother, with\r\namaze at their former disparagement, and a sigh at their blind hardness\r\nof heart.\r\n\r\nIn all probability, Mrs. Dale took this view of the subject; and\r\ncertainly, in addition to all the hitherto dormant virtues which would\r\nbe awakened in Miss Jemima when fairly Mrs. Riccabocca, she counted\r\nsomewhat upon the mere worldly advantage which such a match would bestow\r\nupon the exile. So respectable a connection with one of the oldest,\r\nwealthiest and most popular families in the shire, would in itself give\r\nhim a position not to be despised by a poor stranger in the land; and\r\nthough the interest of Miss Jemima's dowry might not be much, regarded\r\nin the light of English pounds, (not Milanese _lire_,) still it would\r\nsuffice to prevent that gradual process of dematerialization which the\r\nlengthened diet upon minnows and sticklebacks had already made apparent\r\nin the fine and slow-evanishing form of the philosopher.\r\n\r\nLike all persons convinced of the expediency of a thing, Mrs. Dale saw\r\nnothing wanting but opportunities to insure success. And that these\r\nmight be forthcoming, she not only renewed with greater frequency, and\r\nmore urgent instance than ever, her friendly invitations to Riccabocca\r\nto drink tea and spend the evening, but she artfully so chafed the\r\nSquire on his sore point of hospitality, that the doctor received weekly\r\na pressing solicitation to dine and sleep at the Hall.\r\n\r\nAt first the Italian pished and grunted, and said _Cospetto_, and _Per\r\nBacco_, and _Diavola_, and tried to creep out of so much proffered\r\ncourtesy. But, like all single gentlemen, he was a little under the\r\ntyrannical influence of his faithful servant; and Jackeymo, though he\r\ncould bear starving as well as his master when necessary, still, when he\r\nhad the option, preferred roast beef and plum-pudding. Moreover, that\r\nvain and incautious confidence of Riccabocca, touching the vast sum at\r\nhis command, and with no heavier drawback than that of so amiable a lady\r\nas Miss Jemima--who had already shown him (Jackeymo) many little\r\ndelicate attentions--had greatly whetted the cupidity which was in the\r\nservant's Italian nature? a cupidity the more keen because, long\r\ndebarred its legitimate exercise on his own mercenary interests, he\r\ncarried it all to the account of his master's!\r\n\r\nThus tempted by his enemy, and betrayed by his servant, the unfortunate\r\nRiccabocca fell, though with eyes not unblinded, into the hospitable\r\nsnares extended for the destruction of his--celibacy! He went often to\r\nthe parsonage, often to the Hall, and by degrees the sweets of the\r\nsocial domestic life, long denied him, began to exercise their\r\nenervating charm upon the stoicism of our poor exile. Frank had now\r\nreturned to Eton. An unexpected invitation had carried off Captain\r\nHigginbotham to pass a few weeks at Bath, with a distant relation, who\r\nhad lately returned from India, and who, as rich as Croesus, felt so\r\nestranged and solitary in his native isle, that, when the Captain\r\n\"claimed kindred there,\" to his own amaze \"he had his claims allowed;\"\r\nwhile a very protracted sitting of Parliament still delayed in London\r\nthe Squire's habitual visitors in the later summer; so that--a chasm\r\nthus made in his society--Mr. Hazeldean welcomed with no hollow\r\ncordiality the diversion or distraction he found in the foreigner's\r\ncompanionship. Thus, with pleasure to all parties, and strong hopes to\r\nthe two female conspirators, the intimacy between the Casino and Hall\r\nrapidly thickened; but still not a word resembling a distinct proposal\r\ndid Dr. Riccabocca breathe. And still, if such an idea obtruded itself\r\non his mind, it was chased therefrom with so determined a _Diavolo_,\r\nthat perhaps, if not the end of the world, at least the end of Miss\r\nJemima's tenure in it, might have approached, and seen her still Miss\r\nJemima, but for a certain letter with a foreign postmark that reached\r\nthe doctor one Tuesday morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nThe servant saw that something had gone wrong, and, under pretence of\r\nsyringing the orange trees, he lingered near his master, and peered\r\nthrough the sunny leaves upon Riccabocca's melancholy brows.\r\n\r\nThe doctor sighed heavily. Nor did he, as was his wont, after some such\r\nsigh, mechanically take up that dear comforter, the pipe. But though the\r\ntobacco pouch lay by his side on the balustrade, and the pipe stood\r\nagainst the wall between his knees, child-like lifting up its lips to\r\nthe customary caress--he heeded neither the one nor the other, but laid\r\nthe letter silently on his lap, and fixed his eyes upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\"It must be bad news indeed!\" thought Jackeymo, and desisted from his\r\nwork. Approaching his master, he took up the pipe and the tobacco pouch,\r\nand filled the bowl slowly, glancing all the while to that dark musing\r\nface on which, when abandoned by the expression of intellectual\r\nvivacity, or the exquisite smile of Italian courtesy, the deep downward\r\nlines revealed the characters of sorrow. Jackeymo did not venture to\r\nspeak; but the continued silence of his master disturbed him much. He\r\nlaid that peculiar tinder which your smokers use upon the steel, and\r\nstruck the spark--still not a word, nor did Riccabocca stretch forth his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"I never knew him in this taking before,\" thought Jackeymo; and\r\ndelicately he insinuated the neck of the pipe into the nerveless fingers\r\nof the hand that lay supine on those quiet knees--the pipe fell to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nJackeymo crossed himself, and began praying to his sainted namesake with\r\ngreat fervor.\r\n\r\nThe doctor rose slowly, and, as if with effort, he walked once or twice\r\nto and fro the terrace; and then he halted abruptly, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Friend!\"\r\n\r\n\"Blessed Monsignore San Giacomo, I knew thou wouldst hear me!\" cried the\r\nservant; and he raised his master's hand to his pipe, then abruptly\r\nturned away and wiped his eyes. \"Friend,\" repeated Riccabocca, and this\r\ntime with a tremulous emphasis, and in the softest tone of a voice never\r\nwholly without the music of the sweet South, \"I would talk to thee of my\r\nchild.\"----\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\"The letter, then, relates to the Signorina. She is well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she is well now. She is in our native Italy.\"\r\n\r\nJackeymo raised his eyes involuntarily towards the orange-trees, and the\r\nmorning breeze swept by and bore to him the odor of their blossoms.\r\n\r\n\"Those are sweet even here, with care,\" said he, pointing to the trees.\r\n\"I think I have said that before to the Padrone.\"\r\n\r\nBut Riccabocca was now looking again at the letter, and did not notice\r\neither the gesture or the remark of his servant.\r\n\r\n\"My aunt is no more!\" said he, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\"We will pray for her soul!\" answered Jackeymo, solemnly. \"But she was\r\nvery old, and had been a long time ailing. Let it not grieve the Padrone\r\ntoo keenly, at that age, and with those infirmities, death comes as a\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace be to her dust!\" returned the Italian. \"If she had her faults, be\r\nthey now forgotten for ever; and in the hour of my danger and distress,\r\nshe sheltered my infant! That shelter is destroyed. This letter is from\r\nthe priest, her confessor. You know that she had nothing at her own\r\ndisposal to bequeath my child, and her property passes to the male\r\nheir--mine enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Traitor!\" muttered Jackeymo; and his right hand seemed to feel for the\r\nweapon which the Italians of lower rank often openly wear in their\r\ngirdles.\r\n\r\n\"The priest,\" resumed Riccabocca, calmly, \"has rightly judged in\r\nremoving my child as a guest from the house in which my enemy enters as\r\nlord.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where is the Signorina?\"\r\n\r\n\"With that poor priest. See, Giacomo--here, here--this is her\r\nhandwriting at the end of the letter--the first lines she ever yet\r\ntraced to me.\"\r\n\r\nJackeymo took off his hat, and looked reverently on the large characters\r\nof a child's writing. But large as they were, they seemed indistinct,\r\nfor the paper was blistered with the child's tears, and on the place\r\nwhere they had _not_ fallen, there was a round fresh moist stain of the\r\ntear that had dropped from the lids of the father. Riccabocca\r\nrenewed,--\"The priest recommends a convent.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the devil with the priest!\" cried the servant; then crossing himself\r\nrapidly, he added, \"I did not mean that, Monsignore San\r\nGiacomo--forgive me! But your excellency[S] does not think of making a\r\nnun of his only child!\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet why not?\" said Riccabocca, mournfully; \"what can I give her in\r\nthe world? Is the land of the stranger a better refuge than the home of\r\npeace in her native clime?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the land of the stranger beats her father's heart!\"\r\n\r\n\"And if that beat were stilled, what then? Ill fares the life that a\r\nsingle death can bereave of all. In a convent at least (and the priest's\r\ninfluence can obtain her that asylum amongst her equals and amidst her\r\nsex) she is safe from trial and penury--to her grave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Penury! Just see how rich we shall be when we take those fields at\r\nMichaelmas.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Pazzie!_\" (follies) said Riccabocca, listlessly. \"Are these suns more\r\nserene than ours, or the soil more fertile? Yet in our own Italy, saith\r\nthe proverb, 'he who sows land, reaps more care than corn.' It were\r\ndifferent,\" continued the father after a pause, and in a more irresolute\r\ntone, \"if I had some independence, however small, to count on--nay, if\r\namong all my tribe of dainty relatives there were but one female who\r\nwould accompany Violante to the exile's hearth--Ishmael had his Hagar.\r\nBut how can we two rough-bearded men provide for all the nameless, wants\r\nand cares of a frail female child? And she has been so delicately\r\nreared--the woman-child needs the fostering hand and tender eye of a\r\nwoman.\"\r\n\r\n\"And with a word,\" said Jackeymo, resolutely, \"the Padrone might secure\r\nto his child all that he needs, to save her from the sepulchre of a\r\nconvent; and ere the autumn leaves fall, she might be sitting on his\r\nknee. Padrone, do not think that you can conceal from me the truth, that\r\nyou love your child better than all things in the world--now the Patria\r\nis as dead to you as the dust of your fathers--and your heart-strings\r\nwould crack with the effort to tear her from them, and consign her to a\r\nconvent. Padrone, never again to hear her voice--never again to see her\r\nface! Those little arms that twined round your neck that dark night,\r\nwhen we fled fast for life and freedom, and you said, as you felt their\r\nclasp, 'Friend, all is not yet lost!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Giacomo!\" exclaimed the father, reproachfully, and his voice seemed to\r\nchoke him. Riccabocca turned away, and walked restlessly to and fro the\r\nterrace; then, lifting his arms with a wild gesture as he still\r\ncontinued his long irregular strides, he muttered, \"Yes, heaven is my\r\nwitness that I could have borne reverse and banishment without a murmur,\r\nhad I permitted myself that young partner in exile and privation. Heaven\r\nis my witness that, if I hesitate now, it is because I would not listen\r\nto my own selfish heart. Yet never, never to see her again--my child!\r\nAnd it was but as the infant that I beheld her! O friend, friend----\"\r\n(and, stopping short with a burst of uncontrollable emotion, he bowed\r\nhis head upon his servant's shoulder;) \"thou knowest what I have endured\r\nand suffered at my hearth, as in my country; the wrong, the perfidy,\r\nthe--the--\" His voice again failed him; he clung to his servant's\r\nbreast, and his whole frame shook.\r\n\r\n\"But your child, the innocent one--I think now only of her!\" faltered\r\nGiacomo, struggling with his own sobs.\r\n\r\n\"True, only of her,\" replied the exile, raising his face--\"only of her.\r\nPut aside thy thoughts for thyself, friend--counsel me. If I were to\r\nsend for Violante, and if, transplanted to these keen airs, she drooped\r\nand died--look, look--the priest says that she needs such tender care;\r\nor if I myself were summoned from the world, to leave her in it alone,\r\nfriendless, homeless, breadless perhaps at the age of woman's sharpest\r\ntrial against temptation, would she not live to mourn the cruel egotism\r\nthat closed on her infant innocence the gates of the House of God?\"\r\n\r\nGiacomo was appalled by this appeal; and indeed Riccabocca had never\r\nbefore thus reverently spoken of the cloister. In his hours of\r\nphilosophy, he was wont to sneer at monks and nuns, priesthood and\r\nsuperstition. But now, in that hour of emotion, the Old Religion\r\nreclaimed her empire; and the skeptical world-wise man, thinking only of\r\nhis child, spoke and felt with a child's simple faith.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\"But again I say,\" murmured Jackeymo, scarce audibly, and after a long\r\nsilence, \"if the Padrone would make up his mind--to marry!\"\r\n\r\nHe expected that his master would start up in his customary indignation\r\nat such a suggestion--nay, he might not have been sorry so to have\r\nchanged the current of feeling; but the poor Italian only winced\r\nslightly, and mildly withdrawing himself from his servant's supporting\r\narm, again paced the terrace, but this time quietly and in silence. A\r\nquarter of an hour thus passed. \"Give me the pipe,\" said Dr. Riccabocca,\r\npassing into the Belvidere.\r\n\r\nJackeymo again struck the spark, and, wonderfully relieved at the\r\nPadrone's return to his usual adviser, mentally besought his sainted\r\nnamesake to bestow a double portion of soothing wisdom on the benignant\r\ninfluences of the weed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nDr. Riccabocca had been some little time in the solitude of the\r\nBelvidere, when Lenny Fairfield, not knowing that his employer was\r\ntherein, entered to lay down a book which the Doctor had lent him, with\r\ninjunctions to leave on a certain table when done with. Riccabocca\r\nlooked up at the sound of the young peasant's step.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your honor's pardon--I did not know----\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind; lay the book there. I wish to speak with you. You look\r\nwell, my child; this air agrees with you as well as that of Hazeldean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet it is higher ground, more exposed?\"\r\n\r\n\"That can hardly be, sir,\" said Lenny; \"there are many plants grow here\r\nwhich don't flourish at the Squire's. The hill yonder keeps off the east\r\nwind, and the place lays to the south.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lies, not _lays_, Lenny. What are the principal complaints in these\r\nparts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean what maladies, what diseases?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never heard tell of any, sir, except the rheumatism.\"\r\n\r\n\"No low fevers?--no consumption?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never heard of them, sir.\"\r\n\r\nRiccabocca drew a long breath, as if relieved.\r\n\r\n\"That seems a very kind family at the Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to say against it,\" answered Lenny, bluntly. \"I have not\r\nbeen treated justly. But as that book says, sir, 'It is not every one\r\nwho comes into the world with a silver spoon in his mouth.'\"\r\n\r\nLittle thought the Doctor that those wise maxims may leave sore thoughts\r\nbehind them. He was too occupied with the subject most at his own heart\r\nto think then of what was in Lenny Fairfield's.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; a kind, English, domestic family. Did you see much of Miss\r\nHazeldean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so much as of the Lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she liked in the village, think you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Jemima? Yes. She never did harm. Her little dog bit me once--she\r\ndid not ask me to beg its pardon, she asked mine! She's a very nice\r\nyoung lady; the girls say she's very affable; and,\" added Lenny with a\r\nsmile, \"there are always more weddings going on when she's down at the\r\nHall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Riccabocca. Then, after a long whiff, \"Did you ever see her\r\nplay with the little children? Is she fond of children, do you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord, sir, you guess every thing! She's never so pleased as when she's\r\nplaying with the babies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" grunted Riccabocca. \"Babies--well, that's womanlike. I don't\r\nmean exactly babies, but when they're older--little girls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, sir, I dare say; but,\" said Lenny, primly, \"I never as yet kept\r\ncompany with the little girls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite right, Lenny; be equally discreet all your life. Mrs. Dale is\r\nvery intimate with Miss Hazeldean--more than with the Squire's lady. Why\r\nis that, think you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" said Leonard, shrewdly, \"Mrs. Dale has her little tempers,\r\nthough she's a very good lady; and Madam Hazeldean is rather high, and\r\nhas a spirit. But Miss Jemima is so soft: any one could live with Miss\r\nJemima, as Joe and the servants say at the Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! Get my hat out of the parlor, and--just bring a clothesbrush,\r\nLenny. A fine sunny day for a walk.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this most mean and dishonorable inquisition into the character and\r\npopular repute of Miss Hazeldean, Signore Riccabocca seemed as much\r\ncheered up and elated as if he had committed some very noble action; and\r\nhe walked forth in the direction of the Hall with a far lighter and\r\nlivelier step than that with which he had paced the terrace.\r\n\r\n\"Monsignore San Giacomo, by thy help and the pipe's, the Padrone shall\r\nhave his child!\" muttered the servant, looking up from the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nYet Dr. Riccabocca was not rash. The man who wants his wedding-garment\r\nto fit him must allow plenty of time for the measure. But, from that\r\nday, the Italian notably changed his manner towards Miss Hazeldean. He\r\nceased that profusion of compliment in which he had hitherto carried off\r\nin safety all serious meaning. For indeed the Doctor considered that\r\ncompliments, to a single gentleman, were what the inky liquid it\r\ndispenses is to the cuttle-fish, that by obscuring the water sails away\r\nfrom its enemy. Neither did he, as before, avoid prolonged conversations\r\nwith that young lady, and contrive to escape from all solitary rambles\r\nby her side. On the contrary, he now sought every occasion to be in her\r\nsociety; and, entirely dropping the language of gallantry, he assumed\r\nsomething of the earnest tone of friendship. He bent down his intellect\r\nto examine and plumb her own. To use a very homely simile, he blew away\r\nthat froth which there is on the surface of mere acquaintanceships,\r\nespecially with the opposite sex; and which, while it lasts, scarce\r\nallows you to distinguish between small beer and double X. Apparently\r\nDr. Riccabocca was satisfied with his scrutiny--at all events, under\r\nthat froth there was no taste of bitter. The Italian might not find any\r\ngreat strength of intellect in Miss Jemima, but he found that,\r\ndisentangled from many little whims and foibles--which he had himself\r\nthe sense to perceive were harmless enough if they lasted, and not so\r\nabsolutely constitutional but what they might be removed by a tender\r\nhand--Miss Hazeldean had quite enough sense to comprehend the plain\r\nduties of married life; and if the sense could fail, it found a\r\nsubstitute in good old homely English principles and the instincts of\r\namiable kindly feelings.\r\n\r\nI know not how it is, but your very clever man never seems to care so\r\nmuch as your less gifted mortals for cleverness in his helpmate. Your\r\nscholars, and poets, and ministers of state, are more often than not\r\nfound assorted with exceedingly humdrum good sort of women, and\r\napparently like them all the better for their deficiencies. Just see how\r\nhappily Racine lived with his wife, and what an angel he thought her,\r\nand yet she had never read his plays. Certainly Goethe never troubled\r\nthe lady who called him \"Mr. Privy Councillor\" with whims about\r\n'monads,' and speculations on 'color,' nor those stiff metaphysical\r\nproblems on which one breaks one's shins in the Second Part of the\r\nFaust. Probably it may be that such great geniuses--knowing that, as\r\ncompared with themselves, there is little difference between your clever\r\nwoman and your humdrum woman--merge at once all minor distinctions,\r\nrelinquish all attempts that could not but prove unsatisfactory, at\r\nsympathy in hard intellectual pursuits, and are quite satisfied to\r\nestablish that tie which, after all, best resists wear and tear--viz.\r\nthe tough household bond between one human heart and another.\r\n\r\nAt all events, this, I suspect, was the reasoning of Dr. Riccabocca,\r\nwhen one morning, after a long walk with Miss Hazeldean, he muttered to\r\nhimself--\r\n\r\n         \"Duro con duro\r\n    Non fece mai buon muro.\"\r\n\r\nWhich may bear the paraphrase, \"Bricks without mortar would make a very\r\nbad wall.\" There was quite enough in Miss Jemima's disposition to make\r\nexcellent mortar: the Doctor took the bricks to himself.\r\n\r\nWhen his examination was concluded, our philosopher symbolically evinced\r\nthe result he had arrived at by a very simple proceeding on his\r\npart--which would have puzzled you greatly if you had not paused, and\r\nmeditated thereon, till you saw all that it implied. _Dr. Riccabocca\r\ntook off his spectacles!_ He wiped them carefully, put them into their\r\nshagreen case, and locked them in his bureau:--that is to say, he left\r\noff wearing his spectacles.\r\n\r\nYou will observe that there was a wonderful depth of meaning in that\r\ncritical symptom, whether it be regarded as a sign outward, positive,\r\nand explicit, or a sign metaphysical, mystical, and esoteric. For, as to\r\nthe last--it denoted that the task of the spectacles was over; that,\r\nwhen a philosopher has made up his mind to marry, it is better\r\nhenceforth to be short-sighted--nay, even somewhat purblind--than to be\r\nalways scrutinizing the domestic felicity to which he is about to resign\r\nhimself, through a pair of cold, unillusory barnacles. And for the\r\nthings beyond the hearth, if he cannot see without spectacles, is he not\r\nabout to ally to his own defective vision a good sharp pair of eyes,\r\nnever at fault where his interests are concerned? On the other hand,\r\nregarded positively, categorically, and explicitly, Dr. Riccabocca, by\r\nlaying aside those spectacles, signified that he was about to commence\r\nthat happy initiation of courtship, when every man, be he ever so much a\r\nphilosopher, wishes to look as young and as handsome as time and nature\r\nwill allow. Vain task to speed the soft language of the eyes through the\r\nmedium of those glassy interpreters! I remember, for my own part, that\r\nonce, on a visit to Adelaide, I was in great danger of falling in\r\nlove--with a young lady, too, who would have brought me a very good\r\nfortune--when she suddenly produced from her reticule a very neat pair\r\nof No. 4, set in tortoise-shell, and, fixing upon me their Gorgon gaze,\r\nfroze the astonished Cupid into stone! And I hold it a great proof of\r\nthe wisdom of Riccabocca, and of his vast experience in mankind, that he\r\nwas not above the consideration of what your pseudo sages would have\r\nregarded as foppish and ridiculous trifles. It argued all the better for\r\nthat happiness which is our being's end and aim, that, in condescending\r\nto play the lover, he put those unbecoming petrifiers under lock and\r\nkey.\r\n\r\nAnd certainly, now the spectacles were abandoned, it was impossible to\r\ndeny that the Italian had remarkably handsome eyes. Even through the\r\nspectacles, or lifted a little above them, they were always bright and\r\nexpressive; but without those adjuncts, the blaze was softer and more\r\ntempered: they had that look which the French call _veloute_, or\r\nvelvety; and he appeared altogether ten years younger. If our Ulysses,\r\nthus rejuvinated by his Minerva, has not fully made up his mind to make\r\na Penelope of Miss Jemima, all I can say is, that he is worse than\r\nPolyphemus, who was only an Anthropophagos;----\r\n\r\nHe preys upon the weaker sex, and is a Gynopophagite!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\"And you commission me, then, to speak to our dear Jemima?\" said Mrs.\r\nDale, joyfully, and without any bitterness whatever in that \"dear.\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Riccabocca._--\"Nay, before speaking to Miss Hazeldean, it would\r\nsurely be proper to know how far my addresses would be acceptable to the\r\nfamily.\"\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Dale._--\"Ah!\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Riccabocca._--\"The Squire is of course the head of the family.\"\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Dale_ (absent and _distrait_.)--\"The Squire--yes, very true--quite\r\nproper.\" (Then looking up, and with _naivete_)--\"Can you believe me, I\r\nnever thought of the Squire. And he is such an odd man, and has so many\r\nEnglish prejudices, that really--dear me, how vexatious that it should\r\nnever once have occurred to me that Mr. Hazeldean had a voice in the\r\nmatter! Indeed, the relationship is so distant--it is not like being her\r\nfather; and Jemima is of age, and can do as she pleases; and--but, as\r\nyou say, it is quite proper that he should be consulted as the head of\r\nthe family.\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Riccabocca._--\"And do you think that the Squire of Hazeldean might\r\nreject my alliance! Pshaw! that's a grand word, indeed;--I mean, that he\r\nmight object very reasonably to his cousin's marriage with a foreigner,\r\nof whom he can know nothing, except that which in all countries is\r\ndisreputable, and is said in this to be criminal--poverty.\"\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Dale_ (kindly.)--\"You misjudge us poor English people, and you\r\nwrong the Squire, Heaven bless him! for we were poor enough when he\r\nsingled out my husband from a hundred for the minister of his parish,\r\nfor his neighbor and his friend. I will speak to him fearlessly----\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Riccabocca._--\"And frankly. And now I have used that word, let me\r\ngo on with the confession which your kindly readiness, my fair friend,\r\nsomewhat interrupted. I said that if I might presume to think my\r\naddresses would be acceptable to Miss Hazeldean and her family, I was\r\ntoo sensible of her amiable qualities not to--not to--\"\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Dale_ (with demure archness.)--\"Not to be the happiest of\r\nmen--that's the customary English phrase, Doctor.\"\r\n\r\n_Riccabocca_ (gallantly.)--\"There cannot be a better. But,\" continued\r\nhe, seriously, \"I wish it first to be understood that I have--been\r\nmarried before.\"\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Dale_ (astonished.)--\"Married before!\"\r\n\r\n_Riccabocca._--\"And that I have an only child, dear to me--inexpressibly\r\ndear. That child, a daughter, has hitherto lived abroad; circumstances\r\nnow render it desirable that she should make her home with me. And I own\r\nfairly that nothing has so attached me to Miss Hazeldean, nor so induced\r\nmy desire for our matrimonial connection, as my belief that she has the\r\nheart and the temper to become a kind mother to my little one.\"\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Dale_ (with feeling and warmth.)--\"You judge her rightly there.\"\r\n\r\n_Riccabocca._--\"Now, in pecuniary matters, as you may conjecture from my\r\nmode of life, I have nothing to offer to Miss Hazeldean correspondent\r\nwith her own fortune, whatever that may be!\"\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Dale._--\"That difficulty is obviated by settling Miss Hazeldean's\r\nfortune on herself, which is customary in such cases.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Riccabocca's face lengthened. \"And my child, then?\" said he,\r\nfeelingly. There was something in that appeal so alien from all sordid\r\nand merely personal mercenary motives, that Mrs. Dale could not have had\r\nthe heart to make the very rational suggestion--\"But that child is not\r\nJemima's, and you may have children by her.\"\r\n\r\nShe was touched, and replied, hesitatingly--\"But, from what you and\r\nJemima may jointly possess, you can save something annually--you can\r\ninsure your life for your child. We did so when our poor child whom we\r\nlost was born,\" (the tears rushed into Mrs. Dale's eyes;) \"and I fear\r\nthat Charles still insures his life for my sake, though Heaven knows\r\nthat--that.----\"\r\n\r\nThe tears burst out. That little heart, quick and petulant though it\r\nwas, had not a fibre of the elastic muscular tissues which are\r\nmercifully bestowed on the hearts of predestined widows. Dr. Riccabocca\r\ncould not pursue the subject of life insurances further. But the\r\nidea--which had never occurred to the foreigner before, though so\r\nfamiliar to us English people when only possessed of a life\r\nincome--pleased him greatly. I will do him the justice to say, that he\r\npreferred it to the thought of actually appropriating to himself and to\r\nhis child a portion of Miss Hazeldean's dower.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards he took his leave, and Mrs. Dale hastened to seek her\r\nhusband in his study, inform him of the success of her matrimonial\r\nscheme, and consult him as to the chance of the Squire's acquiescence\r\ntherein. \"You see,\" said she, hesitatingly, \"though the Squire might be\r\nglad to see Jemima married to some Englishman, yet, if he asks who and\r\nwhat is this Dr. Riccabocca, how am I to answer him?\"\r\n\r\n\"You should have thought of that before,\" said Mr. Dale, with unwonted\r\nasperity; \"and, indeed, if I had ever believed any thing serious could\r\ncome out of what seemed to me so absurd, I should long since have\r\nrequested you not to interfere in such matters. Good heavens!\" continued\r\nthe Parson, changing color, \"if we should have assisted, underhand as it\r\nwere, to introduce into the family of a man to whom we owe so much, a\r\nconnection that he would dislike! how base we should be!--how\r\nungrateful!\"\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Dale was frightened by this speech, and still more by her\r\nhusband's consternation and displeasure. To do Mrs. Dale justice,\r\nwhenever her mild partner was really either grieved or offended, her\r\nlittle temper vanished--she became as meek as a lamb. As soon as she\r\nrecovered the first shock she experienced, she hastened to dissipate the\r\nParson's apprehensions. She assured him that she was convinced that, if\r\nthe Squire disapproved of Riccabocca's pretensions, the Italian would\r\nwithdraw them at once, and Mrs. Hazeldean would never know of his\r\nproposals. Therefore, in that case, no harm would be done.\r\n\r\nThis assurance coincided with Mr. Dale's convictions as to Riccabocca's\r\nscruples on the point of honor, tended much to compose the good man; and\r\nif he did not, as my reader of the gentler sex would expect from him,\r\nfeel alarm lest Miss Jemima's affections should have been irretrievably\r\nengaged, and her happiness thus put in jeopardy by the Squire's refusal,\r\nit was not that the Parson wanted tenderness of heart, but experience in\r\nwoman-kind; and he believed, very erroneously, that Miss Jemima\r\nHazeldean was not one upon whom a disappointment of that kind would\r\nproduce a lasting impression. Therefore Mr. Dale, after a pause of\r\nconsideration, said kindly----\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't vex yourself--and I was to blame quite as much as you. But,\r\nindeed, I should have thought it easier for the Squire to have\r\ntransplanted one of his tall cedars into his kitchen-garden, than for\r\nyou to inveigle Dr. Riccabocca into matrimonial intentions. But a man\r\nwho could voluntarily put himself into the parish stocks for the sake of\r\nexperiment, must be capable of any thing! However, I think it better\r\nthat I, rather than yourself, should speak to the Squire, and I will go\r\nat once.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nThe Parson put on the shovel hat, which--conjoined with other details in\r\nhis dress peculiarly clerical, and already, even then, beginning to be\r\nout of fashion with churchmen--had served to fix upon him, emphatically,\r\nthe dignified but antiquated style and cognomen of \"Parson;\" and took\r\nhis way towards the Home Farm, at which he expected to find the Squire.\r\nBut he had scarcely entered upon the village green when he beheld Mr.\r\nHazeldean, leaning both hands on his stick, and gazing intently upon the\r\nparish stocks. Now, sorry am I to say that, ever since the Hegira of\r\nLenny and his mother, the anti-stockian and revolutionary spirit in\r\nHazeldean, which the memorable homily of our Parson had awhile averted\r\nor suspended, had broken forth afresh. For though, while Lenny was\r\npresent to be moved and jeered at, there had been no pity for him, yet\r\nno sooner was he removed from the scene of trial, than a universal\r\ncompassion for the barbarous usage he had received produced what is\r\ncalled \"the reaction of public opinion.\" Not that those who had mowed\r\nand jeered repented them of their mockery, or considered themselves in\r\nthe slightest degree the cause of his expatriation. No; they, with the\r\nrest of the villagers, laid all the blame upon the stocks. It was not to\r\nbe expected that a lad of such exemplary character could be thrust into\r\nthat place of ignominy, and not be sensible of the affront. And who, in\r\nthe whole village, was safe, if such goings-on and puttings-in were to\r\nbe tolerated in silence, and at the expense of the very best and\r\nquietest lad the village had ever known? Thus, a few days after the\r\nwidow's departure, the stocks was again the object of midnight\r\ndesecration: it was bedaubed and bescratched--it was hacked and\r\nhewed--it was scrawled all over with pithy lamentations for Lenny, and\r\nlaconic execrations for tyrants. Night after night new inscriptions\r\nappeared, testifying the sarcastic wit and the vindictive sentiment of\r\nthe parish. And perhaps the stocks themselves were only spared from axe\r\nand bonfire by the convenience they afforded to the malice of the\r\ndisaffected: they became the Pasquin of Hazeldean.\r\n\r\nAs disaffection naturally produces a correspondent vigor in authority,\r\nso affairs had been lately administered with greater severity than had\r\nbeen hitherto wont in the easy rule of the Squire and his predecessors.\r\nSuspected persons were naturally marked out by Mr. Stirn, and reported\r\nto his employer, who, too proud or too pained to charge them openly with\r\ningratitude, at first only passed them by in his walks with a silent and\r\nstiff inclination of his head; and afterwards gradually yielding to the\r\nbaleful influence of Stirn, the Squire grumbled forth that \"he did not\r\nsee why he should be always putting himself out of his way to show\r\nkindness to those who made such a return. There ought to be a difference\r\nbetween the good and the bad.\" Encouraged by this admission, Stirn had\r\nconducted himself towards the suspected parties, and their whole kith\r\nand kin, with the iron-handed justice that belonged to his character.\r\nFor some, habitual donations of milk from the dairy, and vegetables from\r\nthe gardens, were surlily suspended: others were informed that their\r\npigs were always trespassing on the woods in search of acorns; or that\r\nthey were violating the Game Laws in keeping lurchers. A beer-house,\r\npopular in the neighborhood, but of late resorted to over-much by the\r\ngrievance-mongers, (and no wonder, since they had become the popular\r\nparty,) was threatened with an application to the magistrates for the\r\nwithdrawal of its license. Sundry old women, whose grandsons were\r\nnotoriously ill-disposed towards the stocks, were interdicted from\r\ngathering dead sticks under the avenues, on pretence that they broke\r\ndown the live boughs; and, what was more obnoxious to the younger\r\nmembers of the parish than most other retaliatory measures, three\r\nchestnut trees, one walnut, and two cherry trees, standing at the bottom\r\nof the park, and which had, from time immemorial, been given up to the\r\nyouth of Hazeldean, were now solemnly placed under the general defence\r\nof \"private property.\" And the crier had announced that, henceforth, all\r\ndepredators on the fruit trees in Copse Hollow would be punished with\r\nthe utmost rigor of the law. Stirn, indeed, recommended much more\r\nstringent proceedings than all these indications of a change of policy,\r\nwhich, he averred, would soon bring the parish to its senses--such as\r\ndiscontinuing many little jobs of unprofitable work that employed the\r\nsurplus labor of the village. But there the Squire, falling into the\r\ndepartment, and under the benigner influence of his Harry, was as yet\r\nnot properly hardened. When it came to a question that affected the\r\nabsolute quantity of loaves to be consumed by the graceless mouths that\r\nfed upon him, the milk of human kindness--with which Providence has so\r\nbountifully supplied that class of the mammalia called the \"Bucolic,\"\r\nand of which our Squire had an extra \"yield\"--burst forth, and washed\r\naway all the indignation of the harsher Adam.\r\n\r\nStill your policy of half measures, which irritates without crushing its\r\nvictims, which flaps an exasperated wasp-nest with a silk pocket\r\nhandkerchief, instead of blowing it up with a match and train, is rarely\r\nsuccessful; and, after three or four other and much guiltier victims\r\nthan Lenny had been incarcerated in the stocks, the parish of Hazeldean\r\nwas ripe for any enormity. Pestilent jacobinical tracts, conceived and\r\ncomposed in the sinks of manufacturing towns--found their way into the\r\npopular beer-house--heaven knows how, though the Tinker was suspected of\r\nbeing the disseminator by all but Stirn, who still, in a whisper,\r\naccused the Papishers. And, finally, there appeared amongst the other\r\ngraphic embellishments which the poor stocks had received, the rude\r\n_gravure_ of a gentleman in a broad-brimmed hat and top-boots, suspended\r\nfrom a gibbet, with the inscription beneath--\"A warnin to hall\r\ntirans--mind your hi!--sighnde Captins Traw.\"\r\n\r\nIt was upon this significant and emblematic portraiture that the Squire\r\nwas gazing when the parson joined him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Parson,\" said Mr. Hazeldean, with a smile which he meant to be\r\npleasant and easy, but which was exceedingly bitter and grim, \"I wish\r\nyou joy of your flock--you see they have just hanged me in effigy!\"\r\n\r\nThe Parson stared, and, though greatly shocked, smothered his emotions;\r\nand attempted, with the wisdom of the serpent and the mildness of the\r\ndove, to find another original for the effigy.\r\n\r\n\"It is very bad,\" quoth he, \"but not so bad as all that, Squire; that's\r\nnot the shape of your hat. It is evidently meant for Mr. Stirn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so?\" said the Squire softened. \"Yet the top-boots--Stirn\r\nnever wears top-boots.\"\r\n\r\n\"No more do you--except in hunting. If you look again, those are not\r\ntops--they are leggings--Stirn wears leggings. Besides, that flourish,\r\nwhich is meant for a nose, is a kind of a hook like Stirn's; whereas\r\nyour nose--though by no means a snub--rather turns up than not, as the\r\nApollo's does, according to the plaster cast in Riccabocca's parlor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor Stirn!\" said the Squire, in a tone that evinced complacency, not\r\nunmingled with compassion, \"that's what a man gets in this world by\r\nbeing a faithful servant, and doing his duty with zeal for his employer.\r\nBut you see that things have come to a strange pass, and the question\r\nnow is, what course to pursue. The miscreants hitherto have defied all\r\nvigilance, and Stirn recommends the employment of a regular nightwatch\r\nwith a lanthorn and bludgeon.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may protect the stocks certainly; but will it keep those\r\ndetestable tracts out of the beer-house?\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall shut the beer-house up at the next sessions.\"\r\n\r\n\"The tracts will break out elsewhere--the humor's in the blood!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've half a mind to run off to Brighton or Leamington--good hunting at\r\nLeamington--for a year, just to let the rogues see how they can get on\r\nwithout me!\"\r\n\r\nThe Squire's lip trembled.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mr. Hazeldean,\" said the Parson, taking his friend's hand, \"I\r\ndon't want to parade my superior wisdom; but if you had taken my advice,\r\n_quieta non movere_. Was there ever a parish so peaceable as this, or a\r\ncountry-gentleman so beloved as you were before you undertook the task\r\nwhich has dethroned kings and ruined states--that of wantonly meddling\r\nwith antiquity, whether for the purpose of uncalled-for repairs or the\r\nrevival of obsolete uses.\"\r\n\r\nAt this rebuke, the Squire did not manifest his constitutional\r\ntendencies to choler; but he replied almost meekly, \"If it were to do\r\nagain, faith, I would leave the parish to the enjoyment of the shabbiest\r\npair of stocks that ever disgraced a village. Certainly I meant it for\r\nthe best--an ornament to the green; however, now they are rebuilt, the\r\nstocks must be supported. Will Hazeldean is not the man to give way to a\r\nset of thankless rapscallions.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said the Parson, \"that you will allow that the House of\r\nTudor, whatever its faults, was a determined resolute dynasty\r\nenough--high-hearted and strong-headed. A Tudor would never have fallen\r\ninto the same calamities as the poor Stuart did!\"\r\n\r\n\"What the plague has the House of Tudor got to do with my stocks?\"\r\n\r\n\"A great deal. Henry the VIII. found a subsidy so unpopular that he gave\r\nit up; and the people, in return, allowed him to cut off as many heads\r\nas he pleased, besides those in his own family. Good Queen Bess, who, I\r\nknow, is your idol in history----\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure! she knighted my ancestor at Tilbury Fort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Queen Bess struggled hard to maintain a certain monopoly; she saw\r\nit would not do, and she surrendered it with that frank heartiness which\r\nbecomes a sovereign, and makes surrender a grace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! and you would have me give up the stocks?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would much rather they had stayed as they were, before you touched\r\nthem; but, as it is, if you could find a good plausible pretext--and\r\nthere is an excellent one at hand;--the sternest kings open prisons, and\r\ngrant favors, upon joyful occasions. Now a marriage in the royal family\r\nis of course a joyful occasion!--and so it should be in that of the King\r\nof Hazeldean.\" Admire that artful turn in the Parson's eloquence!--it\r\nwas worthy of Riccabocca himself. Indeed, Mr. Dale had profited much by\r\nhis companionship with that Machiavellian intellect.\r\n\r\n\"A marriage--yes; but Frank has only just got into long tails!\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not allude to Frank, but to your cousin Jemima!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nThe Squire staggered as if the breath had been knocked out of him, and,\r\nfor want of a better seat, sat down on the stocks.\r\n\r\nAll the female heads in the neighboring cottages peered, themselves\r\nunseen, through the casements. What could the Squire be about?--what new\r\nmischief did he meditate? Did he mean to fortify the stocks? Old Gaffer\r\nSolomons, who had an indefinite idea of the lawful power of squires, and\r\nwho had been for the last ten minutes at watch on his threshold, shook\r\nhis head and said--\"Them as a cut out the mon, a-hanging, as a put it in\r\nthe Squire's head!\"\r\n\r\n\"Put what?\" asked his granddaughter.\r\n\r\n\"The gallus!\" answered Solomons--\"he be a-goin' to have it hung from the\r\ngreat elm-tree. And the Parson, good mon, is a-quoting Scripter agin\r\nit--you see, he's a taking off his gloves, and a putting his two han's\r\ntogither, as he do when he pray for the sick, Jeany.\"\r\n\r\nThat description of the Parson's mien and manner, which, with his usual\r\nniceness of observation, Gaffer Solomons thus sketched off, will convey\r\nto you some idea of the earnestness with which the Parson pleaded the\r\ncause he had undertaken to advocate. He dwelt much upon the sense of\r\npropriety which the foreigner had evinced in requesting that the Squire\r\nmight be consulted before any formal communication to his cousin; and he\r\nrepeated Mrs. Dale's assurance, that such were Riccabocca's high\r\nstandard of honor and belief in the sacred rights of hospitality, that,\r\nif the Squire withheld his consent to his proposals, the Parson was\r\nconvinced that the Italian would instantly retract them. Now,\r\nconsidering that Miss Hazeldean was, to say the least, come to years of\r\ndiscretion, and the Squire had long since placed her property entirely\r\nat her own disposal, Mr. Hazeldean was forced to acquiesce in the\r\nParson's corollary remark, \"That this was a delicacy which could not be\r\nexpected from every English pretender to the lady's hand.\" Seeing that\r\nhe had so far cleared ground, the Parson went on to intimate, though\r\nwith great tact, that, since Miss Jemima would probably marry sooner or\r\nlater, (and, indeed, that the Squire could not wish to prevent her,) it\r\nmight be better for all parties concerned that it should be with some\r\none who, though a foreigner, was settled in the neighborhood, and of\r\nwhose character what was known was certainly favorable, than run the\r\nhazard of her being married for her money by some adventurer or Irish\r\nfortune-hunter at the watering-places she yearly visited. Then he\r\ntouched lightly on Riccabocca's agreeable and companionable qualities;\r\nand, concluded with a skilful peroration upon the excellent occasion the\r\nwedding would afford to reconcile Hall and parish, by making a voluntary\r\nholocaust of the stocks.\r\n\r\nAs he concluded, the Squire's brow, before thoughtful, though not\r\nsullen, cleared up benignly. To say truth, the Squire was dying to get\r\nrid of the stocks, if he could but do so handsomely and with dignity;\r\nand if all the stars in the astrological horoscope had conjoined\r\ntogether to give Miss Jemima \"assurance of a husband,\" they could not so\r\nhave served her with the Squire, as that conjunction between the altar\r\nand the stocks which the Parson had effected!\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when Mr. Dale had come to an end, the Squire replied with\r\ngreat placidity and good sense, \"That Mr. Rickeybockey had behaved very\r\nmuch like a gentleman, and that he was very much obliged to him; that he\r\n(the Squire) had no right to interfere in the matter, farther than with\r\nhis advice; that Jemima was old enough to choose for herself, and that,\r\nas the Parson had implied, after all, she might go farther and fare\r\nworse--indeed, the farther she went, (that is, the longer she waited,)\r\nthe worse she was likely to fare. I own, for my part,\" continued the\r\nSquire, \"that, though I like Rickeybockey very much, I never suspected\r\nthat Jemima was caught with his long face; but there's no accounting for\r\ntastes. My Harry, indeed, was more shrewd, and gave me many a hint, for\r\nwhich I only laughed at her. Still I ought to have thought it looked\r\nqueer when Mounseer took to disguising himself by leaving off his\r\nglasses, ha--ha! I wonder what Harry will say; let's go and talk to\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nThe Parson, rejoiced at this easy way of taking the matter, hooked his\r\narm into the Squire's, and they walked amicably towards the Hall. But on\r\ncoming first into the gardens, they found Mrs. Hazeldean herself,\r\nclipping dead leaves or fading flowers from her rose-trees. The Squire\r\nstole slily behind her, and startled her in her turn by putting his arm\r\nround her waist, and saluting her smooth cheek with one of his hearty\r\nkisses; which, by the way, from some association of ideas, was a\r\nconjugal freedom that he usually indulged whenever a wedding was going\r\non in the village.\r\n\r\n\"Fie, William!\" said Mrs. Hazeldean coyly, and blushing as she saw the\r\nParson, \"Well, who's going to be married now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord, was there ever such a woman?--she's guessed it!\" cried the Squire\r\nin great admiration. \"Tell her all about it, Parson.\"\r\n\r\nThe Parson obeyed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazeldean, as the reader may suppose, showed much less surprise\r\nthan her husband had done; but she took the news graciously, and made\r\nmuch the same answer as that which had occurred to the Squire, only with\r\nsomewhat more qualification and reserve. \"Signor Riccabocca had behaved\r\nvery handsomely; and though a daughter of the Hazeldeans of Hazeldean\r\nmight expect a much better marriage in a worldly point of view, yet as\r\nthe lady in question had deferred finding one so long, it would be\r\nequally idle and impertinent now to quarrel with her choice--if indeed\r\nshe should decide on accepting Signor Riccabocca. As for fortune, that\r\nwas a consideration for the two contracting parties. Still, it ought to\r\nbe pointed out to Miss Jemima that the interest of her fortune would\r\nafford but a very small income. That Dr. Riccabocca was a widower was\r\nanother matter for deliberation; and it seemed rather suspicious that he\r\nshould have been hitherto so close upon all matters connected with his\r\nformer life. Certainly his manners were in his favor, and as long as he\r\nwas merely an acquaintance, and at most a tenant, no one had a right to\r\ninstitute inquiries of a strictly private nature; but that, when he was\r\nabout to marry a Hazeldean of Hazeldean, it became the Squire at least\r\nto know a little more about him--who and what he was. Why did he leave\r\nhis own country? English people went abroad to save; no foreigner would\r\nchoose England as a country in which to save money! She supposed that a\r\nforeign doctor was no very great things; probably he had been a\r\nprofessor in some Italian university. At all events, if the Squire\r\ninterfered at all, it was on such points that he should request\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\"My dear madam,\" said the Parson, \"what you say is extremely just. As to\r\nthe causes which have induced our friend to expatriate himself, I think\r\nwe need not look far for them. He is evidently one of the many Italian\r\nrefugees whom political disturbances have driven to our shore, whose\r\nboast is to receive all exiles of whatever party. For his respectability\r\nof birth and family he certainly ought to obtain some vouchers. And if\r\nthat be the only objection, I trust we may soon congratulate Miss\r\nHazeldean on a marriage with a man who, though certainly very poor, has\r\nborne privations without a murmur; has preferred all hardships to debt;\r\nhas scorned to attempt betraying her into any clandestine connection;\r\nwho, in short, has shown himself so upright and honest, that I hope my\r\ndear Mr. Hazeldean will forgive him if he is only a Doctor--probably of\r\nLaws--and not, as most foreigners pretend to be, a marquis, or a baron\r\nat least.\"\r\n\r\n\"As to that,\" cried the Squire, \"'tis the best think I know about\r\nRickeybockey, that he don't attempts to humbug us by any such foreign\r\ntrumpery. Thank heaven, the Hazeldeans of Hazeldean were never\r\nturf-hunters and title-mongers; and if I never ran after an English\r\nlord, I should certainly be devilishly ashamed of a brother-in-law whom\r\nI was forced to call markee or count! I should feel sure he was a\r\ncourier, or runaway valley-de-sham. Turn up your nose at a doctor,\r\nindeed, Harry!--pshaw, good English style that! Doctor! my aunt married\r\na Doctor of Divinity--excellent man--wore a wig, and was made a dean! So\r\nlong as Rickeybockey is not a doctor of physic, I don't care a button.\r\nIf he's _that_, indeed, it would be suspicious; because, you see, those\r\nforeign doctors of physic are quacks, and tell fortunes, and go about on\r\na stage with a Merry-Andrew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord, Hazeldean! where on earth did you pick up that idea?\" said Harry,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\"Pick it up!--why, I saw a fellow myself at the cattle fair last\r\nyear--when I was buying short-horns--with a red waistcoat and a cocked\r\nhat, a little like the Parson's shovel. He called himself Doctor\r\nPhoscophornio--wore a white wig and sold pills! The Merry-Andrew was the\r\nfunniest creature--in salmon-colored tights--turned head over heels, and\r\nsaid he came from Timbuctoo. No, no; if Rickeybockey's a physic Doctor,\r\nwe shall have Jemima in a pink tinsel dress, tramping about the country\r\nin a caravan!\"\r\n\r\nAt this notion, both the Squire and his wife laughed so heartily that\r\nthe Parson felt the thing was settled, and slipped away, with the\r\nintention of making his report to Riccabocca.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nIt was with a slight disturbance of his ordinary suave and well-bred\r\nequanimity that the Italian received the information, that he need\r\napprehend no obstacle to his suit from the insular prejudices or the\r\nworldly views of the lady's family. Not that he was mean and cowardly\r\nenough to recoil from the near and unclouded prospect of that felicity\r\nwhich he had left off his glasses to behold with unblinking naked\r\neyes:--no, there his mind was made up; but he had met with very little\r\nkindness in life, and he was touched not only by the interest in his\r\nwelfare testified by a heretical priest, but by the generosity with\r\nwhich he was admitted into a well-born and wealthy family, despite his\r\nnotorious poverty and his foreign descent. He conceded the propriety of\r\nthe only stipulation, which was conveyed to him by the Parson with all\r\nthe delicacy that became a man professionally habituated to deal with\r\nthe subtler susceptibilities of mankind--viz., that, amongst\r\nRiccabocca's friends or kindred, some one should be found whose report\r\nwould confirm the persuasion of his respectability entertained by his\r\nneighbors;--he assented, I say, to the propriety of this condition; but\r\nit was not with alacrity and eagerness. His brow became clouded. The\r\nParson hastened to assure him that the Squire was not a man _qui stupet\r\nin titulis_, (who was besotted with titles,) that he neither expected\r\nnor desired to find an origin and rank for his brother-in-law above that\r\ndecent mediocrity of condition to which it was evident, from\r\nRiccabocca's breeding and accomplishments, he could easily establish his\r\nclaim. \"And though,\" said he, smiling, \"the Squire is a warm politician\r\nin his own country, and would never see his sister again, I fear, if she\r\nmarried some convicted enemy of our happy constitution, yet for foreign\r\npolitics he does not care a straw; so that if, as I suspect, your exile\r\narises from some quarrel with your government--which, being foreign, he\r\ntakes for granted must be insupportable--he would but consider you as he\r\nwould a Saxon who fled from the iron hand of William the Conqueror, or a\r\nLancastrian expelled by the Yorkists in our Wars of the Roses.\"\r\n\r\nThe Italian smiled. \"Mr. Hazeldean shall be satisfied,\" said he simply.\r\n\"I see, by the Squire's newspaper, that an English gentleman who knew me\r\nin my own country has just arrived in London. I will write to him for a\r\ntestimonial, at least to my probity and character. Probably he may be\r\nknown to you by name--nay, he must be, for he was a distinguished\r\nofficer in the late war. I allude to Lord L'Estrange.\"\r\n\r\nThe parson started.\r\n\r\n\"You know Lord L'Estrange?--a profligate bad man, I fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Profligate!--bad!\" exclaimed Riccabocca. \"Well, calumnious as the world\r\nis, I should never have thought that such expressions would be applied\r\nto one who, though I knew him but little--knew him chiefly by the\r\nservice he once rendered to me--first taught me to love and revere the\r\nEnglish name!\"\r\n\r\n\"He may be changed since----\" The parson paused.\r\n\r\n\"Since when?\" asked Riccabocca, with evident curiosity.\r\n\r\nMr. Dale seemed embarrassed. \"Excuse me,\" said he, \"it is many years\r\nago; and, in short, the opinion I then formed of the gentleman in\r\nquestion was based upon circumstances which I cannot communicate.\"\r\n\r\nThe punctilious Italian bowed in silence but he still looked as if he\r\nshould have liked to prosecute inquiry.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, he said, \"Whatever your impressions respecting Lord\r\nL'Estrange, there is nothing, I suppose, which would lead you to doubt\r\nhis honor, or reject his testimonial in my favor?\"\r\n\r\n\"According to fashionable morality,\" said Mr. Dale, rather precisely, \"I\r\nknow of nothing that could induce me to suppose that Lord L'Estrange\r\nwould not, in this instance, speak the truth. And he has unquestionably\r\na high reputation as a soldier, and a considerable position in the\r\nworld.\" Therewith the Parson took his leave. A few days afterwards Dr.\r\nRiccabocca inclosed to the Squire, in a blank envelope, a letter he had\r\nreceived from Harley L'Estrange. It was evidently intended for the\r\nSquire's eye, and to serve as a voucher for the Italian's\r\nrespectability; but this object was fulfilled, not in the coarse form of\r\na direct testimonial, but with a tact and delicacy which seemed to show\r\nmore than the fine breeding to be expected from one in Lord L'Estrange's\r\nstation. It argued that most exquisite of all politeness which comes\r\nfrom the heart: a certain tone of affectionate respect (which even the\r\nhomely sense of the Squire felt, intuitively, proved far more in favor\r\nof Riccabocca than the most elaborate certificate of his qualities and\r\nantecedents) pervaded the whole, and would have sufficed in itself to\r\nremove all scruples from a mind much more suspicious and exacting than\r\nthat of the Squire of Hazeldean. But, lo and behold! an obstacle now\r\noccurred to the Parson, of which he ought to have thought long\r\nbefore--viz., the Papistical religion of the Italian. Dr. Riccabocca was\r\nprofessedly a Roman Catholic. He so little obtruded that fact--and,\r\nindeed, had assented so readily to any animadversions upon the\r\nsuperstition and priestcraft which, according to Protestants, are the\r\nessential characteristics of Papistical communities--that it was not\r\ntill the hymeneal torch, which brings all faults to light, was fairly\r\nillumined for the altar, that the remembrance of a faith so cast into\r\nthe shade burst upon the conscience of the Parson. The first idea that\r\nthen occurred to him was the proper and professional one--viz., the\r\nconversion of Dr. Riccabocca. He hastened to his study, took down from\r\nhis shelves long neglected volumes of controversial divinity, armed\r\nhimself with an arsenal of authorities, arguments, and texts; then,\r\nseizing the shovel-hat, posted off to the Casino.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nThe Parson burst upon the philosopher like an avalanche! He was so full\r\nof his subject that he could not let it out in prudent driblets. No, he\r\nwent souse upon the astounded Riccabocca--\r\n\r\n              \"Tremendo,\r\n    Jupiter ipse ruens tumultu.\"\r\n\r\nThe sage--shrinking deeper into his arm-chair, and drawing his\r\ndressing-robe more closely round him--suffered the Parson to talk for\r\nthree quarters of an hour, till indeed he had thoroughly proved his\r\ncase; and, like Brutus, \"paused for a reply.\"\r\n\r\nThen said Riccabocca mildly, \"In much of what you have urged so ably,\r\nand so suddenly, I am inclined to agree. But base is the man who\r\nformally forswears the creed he has inherited from his fathers, and\r\nprofessed since the cradle up to years of maturity, when the change\r\npresents itself in the guise of a bribe;--when, for such is human\r\nnature, he can hardly distinguish or disentangle the appeal to his\r\nreason from the lure to his interests--here a text, and there a\r\ndowry!--here Protestantism, there Jemima!--Own, my friend, that the\r\nsoberest casuist would see double under the inebriating effects produced\r\nby so mixing his polemical liquors. Appeal, my good Mr. Dale, from\r\nPhilip drunken to Philip sober!--from Riccabocca intoxicated with the\r\nassurance of your excellent lady, that he is about to be \"the happiest\r\nof men,\" to Riccabocca accustomed to his happiness, and carrying it off\r\nwith the seasoned equability of one grown familiar with stimulants--in a\r\nword, appeal from Riccabocca the wooer to Riccabocca the spouse. I may\r\nbe convertible, but conversion is a slow process; courtship should be a\r\nquick one--ask Miss Jemima. _Finalmente_, marry me first, and convert me\r\nafterwards!\"\r\n\r\n\"You take this too jestingly,\" began the Parson; \"and I don't see why,\r\nwith your excellent understanding, truths so plain and obvious should\r\nnot strike you at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Truths,\" interrupted Riccabocca profoundly, \"are the slowest growing\r\nthings in the world! It took 1500 years from the date of the Christian\r\nera to produce your own Luther, and then he flung his Bible at Satan, (I\r\nhave seen the mark made by the book on the wall of his prison in\r\nGermany,) besides running off with a nun, which no Protestant clergyman\r\nwould think it proper and right to do now-a-days.\" Then he added, with\r\nseriousness, \"Look you, my dear sir,--I should lose my own esteem if I\r\nwere even to listen to you now with becoming attention,--now, I say,\r\nwhen you hint that the creed I have professed may be in the way of my\r\nadvantage. If so, I must keep the creed and resign the advantage. But\r\nif, as I trust--not only as a Christian, but a man of honor--you will\r\ndefer this discussion, I will promise to listen to you hereafter; and\r\nthough, to say truth, I believe that you will not convert me, I will\r\npromise you faithfully never to interfere with my wife's religion.\"\r\n\r\n\"And any children you may have?\"\r\n\r\n\"Children!\" said Dr. Riccabocca, recoiling--\"you are not contented with\r\nfiring your pocket-pistol right in my face; you must also pepper me all\r\nover with small-shot. Children! well, if they are girls, let them follow\r\nthe faith of their mother; and if boys, while in childhood, let them be\r\ncontented with learning to be Christians; and when they grow into men,\r\nlet them choose for themselves which is the best form for the practice\r\nof the great principles which all sects have in common.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" began Mr. Dale again, pulling a large book from his pocket.\r\n\r\nDr. Riccabocca flung open the window, and jumped out of it.\r\n\r\nIt was the rapidest and most dastardly flight you could possibly\r\nconceive; but it was a great compliment to the argumentative powers of\r\nthe Parson, and he felt it as such. Nevertheless, Mr. Dale thought it\r\nright to have a long conversation, both with the Squire and Miss Jemima\r\nherself, upon the subject which his intended convert had so\r\nignominiously escaped.\r\n\r\nThe Squire, though a great foe to Popery, politically considered, had\r\nalso quite as great a hatred to turn-coats and apostates. And in his\r\nheart he would have despised Riccabocca if he could have thrown off his\r\nreligion as easily as he had done his spectacles. Therefore he said\r\nsimply--\"Well, it is certainly a great pity that Rickeybockey is not of\r\nthe Church of England, though, I take it, that would be unreasonable to\r\nexpect in a man born and bred under the nose of the Inquisition,\" (the\r\nSquire firmly believed that the Inquisition was in full force in all the\r\nItalian states, with whips, racks, and thumbscrews; and, indeed, his\r\nchief information of Italy was gathered from a perusal he had given in\r\nearly youth to _The One-Handed Monk_;) \"but I think he speaks very\r\nfairly, on the whole, as to his wife and children. And the thing's gone\r\ntoo far now to retract. It is all your fault for not thinking of it\r\nbefore; and I've now just made up my mind as to the course to pursue\r\nrespecting those--d----d stocks!\"\r\n\r\nAs for Miss Jemima, the Parson left her with a pious thanksgiving that\r\nRiccabocca at least was a Christian, and not a Pagan, Mahometan, or Jew!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nThere is that in a wedding which appeals to a universal sympathy. No\r\nother event in the lives of their superiors in rank creates an equal\r\nsensation amongst the humbler classes.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment the news had spread throughout the village that Miss\r\nJemima was to be married, all the old affection for the Squire and his\r\nhouse burst forth the stronger for its temporary suspension. Who could\r\nthink of the stocks in such a season? They were swept out of\r\nfashion--hunted from remembrance as completely as the question of Repeal\r\nor the thought of Rebellion from the warm Irish heart, when the fair\r\nyoung face of the Royal Wife beamed on the sister isle.\r\n\r\nAgain cordial courtesies were dropped at the thresholds by which the\r\nSquire passed to his home farm; again the sunburnt brows uncovered--no\r\nmore with sullen ceremony--were smoothed into cheerful gladness at his\r\nnod. Nay, the little ones began again to assemble at their ancient\r\nrendezvous by the stocks, as if either familiarized with the phenomenon,\r\nor convinced that, in the general sentiment of good-will, its powers of\r\nevil were annulled.\r\n\r\nThe Squire tasted once more the sweets of the only popularity which is\r\nmuch worth having, and the loss of which a wise man would reasonably\r\ndeplore; viz., the popularity which arises from a persuasion of our\r\ngoodness, and a reluctance to recall our faults. Like all blessings, the\r\nmore sensibly felt from previous interruption, the Squire enjoyed this\r\nrestored popularity with an exhilarated sense of existence; his stout\r\nheart beat more vigorously, his stalwart step trod more lightly; his\r\ncomely English face looked comelier and more English than ever;--you\r\nwould have been a merrier man for a week to have come within hearing of\r\nhis jovial laugh.\r\n\r\nHe felt grateful to Jemima and to Riccabocca as the special agents of\r\nProvidence in this general _integratio amoris_. To have looked at him,\r\nyou would suppose that it was the Squire who was going to be married a\r\nsecond time to his Harry!\r\n\r\nOne may well conceive that such would have been an inauspicious moment\r\nfor Parson Dale's theological scruples. To have stopped that\r\nmarriage--chilled all the sunshine it diffused over the village--seen\r\nhimself surrounded again by long, sulky visages,--I verily believe,\r\nthough a better friend of Church and State never stood on a hustings,\r\nthat, rather than court such a revulsion, the Squire would have found\r\njesuitical excuses for the marriage if Riccabocca had been discovered to\r\nbe the Pope in disguise! As for the stocks, their fate was now\r\nirrevocably sealed. In short, the marriage was concluded--first\r\nprivately, according to the bridegroom's creed, by a Roman Catholic\r\nclergyman, who lived in a town some miles off, and next publicly in the\r\nvillage church of Hazeldean.\r\n\r\nIt was the heartiest rural wedding! Village girls strewed flowers on the\r\nway;--a booth was placed amidst the prettiest scenery of the park, on\r\nthe margin of the lake--for there was to be a dance later in the day; an\r\nox was roasted whole. Even Mr. Stirn--no, Mr. Stirn was _not_ present,\r\nso much happiness would have been the death of him! And the Papisher\r\ntoo, who had conjured Lenny out of the stocks; nay, who had himself sat\r\nin the stocks for the very purpose of bringing them into contempt--the\r\nPapisher! he had as lief Miss Jemima had married the devil! Indeed, he\r\nwas persuaded that, in point of fact, it was all one and the same.\r\nTherefore Mr. Stirn had asked leave to go and attend his uncle the\r\npawnbroker, about to undergo a torturing operation for the stone! Frank\r\nwas there, summoned from Eton for the occasion--having grown two inches\r\ntaller since he left--for the one inch of which nature was to be\r\nthanked, for the other a new pair of resplendent Wellingtons. But the\r\nboy's joy was less apparent than that of others. For Jemima was a\r\nspecial favorite with him, as she would have been with all boys--for she\r\nwas always kind and gentle, and made many pretty presents whenever she\r\ncame from the watering-places. And Frank knew that he should miss her\r\nsadly, and thought she had made a very queer choice.\r\n\r\nCaptain Higginbotham had been invited; but, to the astonishment of\r\nJemima, he had replied to the invitation by a letter to herself, marked\r\n\"_private and confidential_.\" \"She must have long known,\" said the\r\nletter, \"of his devoted attachment to her; motives of delicacy, arising\r\nfrom the narrowness of his income and the magnanimity of his sentiments,\r\nhad alone prevented his formal proposals; but now that he was informed\r\n(he could scarcely believe his senses, or command his passions) that her\r\nrelations wished to force her into a BARBAROUS marriage with a foreigner\r\nof MOST FORBIDDING APPEARANCE, and most _abject circumstances_, he lost\r\nnot a moment in laying at her feet his own hand and fortune. And he did\r\nthis the more confidently, inasmuch as he could not but be aware of Miss\r\nJemima's SECRET feelings towards him, while he was _proud_ and _happy_\r\nto say, that his dear and distinguished cousin, Mr. Sharpe Currie, had\r\nhonored him with a warmth of regard, which justified the most\r\n_brilliant_ EXPECTATIONS--likely to be _soon_ realized--as his eminent\r\nrelative had contracted a _very bad liver complaint_ in the service of\r\nhis country, and could not last long!\"\r\n\r\nIn all the years they had known each other, Miss Jemima, strange as it\r\nmay appear, had never once suspected the Captain of any other feelings\r\nto her than those of a brother. To say that she was not gratified by\r\nlearning her mistake, would be to say that she was more than woman.\r\nIndeed, it must have been a source of no ignoble triumph to think that\r\nshe could prove her disinterested affection to her dear Riccabocca, by a\r\nprompt rejection of this more brilliant offer. She couched the\r\nrejection, it is true, in the most soothing terms. But the Captain\r\nevidently considered himself ill used; he did not reply to the letter,\r\nand did not come to the wedding.\r\n\r\nTo let the reader into a secret, never known to Miss Jemima, Captain\r\nHigginbotham was much less influenced by Cupid than by Plutus in the\r\noffer he had made. The Captain was one of that class of gentlemen who\r\nread their accounts by those corpse-lights, or will-o'-the-wisps, called\r\n_expectations_. Ever since the Squire's grandfather had left him--then\r\nin short clothes--a legacy of L500, the Captain had peopled the future\r\nwith expectations! He talked of his expectations as a man talks of\r\nshares in a Tontine; they might fluctuate a little--be now up and now\r\ndown--but it was morally impossible, if he lived on, but that he should\r\nbe a _millionaire_ one of these days. Now, though Miss Jemima was a good\r\nfifteen years younger than himself, yet she always stood for a good\r\nround sum in the ghostly books of the Captain. She was an _expectation_\r\nto the full amount of her L4000, seeing that Frank was an only child,\r\nand it would be carrying coals to Newmarket to leave _him_ any thing.\r\n\r\nRather than see so considerable a cipher suddenly spunged out of his\r\nvisionary ledger--rather than so much money should vanish clean out of\r\nthe family, Captain Higginbotham had taken what he conceived, if a\r\ndesperate, at least a certain, step for the preservation of his\r\nproperty. If the golden horn could not be had without the heifer, why,\r\nhe must take the heifer into the bargain. He had never formed to himself\r\nan idea that a heifer so gentle would toss and fling him over. The blow\r\nwas stunning. But no one compassionates the misfortunes of the covetous,\r\nthough few perhaps are in greater need of compassion. And leaving poor\r\nCaptain Higginbotham to retrieve his illusory fortunes as he best may\r\namong \"the expectations\" which gathered round the form of Mr. Sharpe\r\nCurrie, who was the crossest old tyrant imaginable, and never allowed at\r\nhis table any dishes not compounded with rice, which played Old Nick\r\nwith the Captain's constitutional functions,--I return to the wedding at\r\nHazeldean, just in time to see the bridegroom--who looked singularly\r\nwell on the occasion--hand the bride (who, between sunshiny tears and\r\naffectionate smiles, was really a very interesting and even a pretty\r\nbride, as brides go) into a carriage which the Squire had presented to\r\nthem, and depart on the orthodox nuptial excursion amidst the blessings\r\nof the assembled crowd.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought strange by the unreflective that these rural\r\nspectators should so have approved and blessed the marriage of a\r\nHazeldean of Hazeldean with a poor, outlandish, long-haired foreigner;\r\nbut, besides that Riccabocca, after all, had become one of the\r\nneighborhood, and was proverbially 'a civil-spoken gentleman,' it is\r\ngenerally noticeable that on wedding occasions the bride so monopolizes\r\ninterest, curiosity, and admiration, that the bridegroom himself goes\r\nfor little or nothing. He is merely the passive agent in the affair--the\r\nunregarded cause of the general satisfaction. It was not Riccabocca\r\nhimself that they approved and blessed--it was the gentleman in the\r\nwhite waistcoat who had made Miss Jemima--Madam Rickeybocky!\r\n\r\nLeaning on his wife's arm, (for it was a habit of the Squire to lean on\r\nhis wife's arm rather than she on his, when he was specially pleased;\r\nand there was something touching in the sight of that strong sturdy\r\nframe thus insensibly, in hours of happiness, seeking dependence on the\r\nfrail arm of woman),--leaning, I say, on his wife's arm, the Squire,\r\nabout the hour of sunset, walked down to the booth by the lake.\r\n\r\nAll the parish--young and old, man, woman, and child--were assembled\r\nthere, and their faces seemed to bear one family likeness, in the common\r\nemotion which animated all, as they turned to his frank fatherly smile.\r\nSquire Hazeldean stood at the head of the long table: he filled a horn\r\nwith ale from the brimming tankard beside him. Then he looked round, and\r\nlifted his hand to request silence; and, ascending the chair, rose in\r\nfull view of all. Every one felt that the Squire was about to make a\r\nspeech, and the earnestness of the attention was proportioned to the\r\nrarity of the event; for (though he was not unpractised in the oratory\r\nof the hustings), only thrice before had the Squire made what could\r\nfairly be called 'a speech' to the villagers of Hazeldean--once on a\r\nkindred festive occasion, when he had presented to them his bride--once\r\nin a contested election for the shire, in which he took more than\r\nordinary interest, and was not quite so sober as he ought to have\r\nbeen--once in a time of great agricultural distress, when, in spite of\r\nreduction of rents, the farmers had been compelled to discard a large\r\nnumber of their customary laborers; and when the Squire had said,--\"I\r\nhave given up keeping the hounds, because I want to make a fine piece of\r\nwater (that was the origin of the lake), and to drain all the low lands\r\nround the park. Let every man who wants work come to me!\" And that sad\r\nyear the parish rates of Hazeldean were not a penny the more.\r\n\r\nNow, for the fourth time, the Squire rose, and thus he spoke. At his\r\nright hand, Harry; at his left, Frank. At the bottom of the table, as\r\nvice-president, Parson Dale, his little wife behind him, only obscurely\r\nseen. She cried readily, and her handkerchief was already before her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.--THE SQUIRE'S SPEECH.\r\n\r\n\"Friends and neighbors:--I thank you kindly for coming round me this\r\nday, and for showing so much interest in me and mine. My cousin was not\r\nborn amongst you as I was, but you have known her from a child. It is a\r\nfamiliar face, and one that never frowned, which you will miss at your\r\ncottage doors, as I and mine will miss it long in the old hall----\"\r\n\r\nHere there was a sob from some of the women, and nothing was seen of\r\nMrs. Dale but the white handkerchief. The Squire himself paused, and\r\nbrushed away a tear with the back of his hand. Then he resumed, with a\r\nsudden change of voice that was electrical--\"For we none of us prize a\r\nblessing till we have lost it! Now, friends and neighbors,--a little\r\ntime ago, it seemed as if some ill-will had crept into the\r\nvillage--ill-will between you and me, neighbors!--why, that is not like\r\nHazeldean!\"\r\n\r\nThe audience hung their heads! You never saw people look so thoroughly\r\nashamed of themselves. The Squire proceeded--\"I don't say it was all\r\nyour fault; perhaps it was mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Noa-noa-noa,\" burst forth in a general chorus.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, friends,\" continued the Squire humbly, and in one of those\r\nillustrative aphorisms which, if less subtle than Riccabocca's, were\r\nmore within reach of the popular comprehension; \"nay--we are all human;\r\nand every man has his hobby; sometimes he breaks in the hobby, and\r\nsometimes the hobby, if it is very hard in the mouth, breaks in him. One\r\nman's hobby has an ill habit of always stopping at the public house!\r\n(Laughter.) Another man's hobby refuses to stir a peg beyond the door\r\nwhere some buxom lass patted its neck the week before--a hobby I rode\r\npretty often when I went courting my good wife here! (Much laughter and\r\napplause.) Others, have a lazy hobby, that there's no getting\r\non;--others, a runaway hobby that there's no stopping: but to cut the\r\nmatter short, my favorite hobby, as you well know, is always trotted out\r\nto any place on my property which seems to want the eye and hand of the\r\nmaster. I hate (cried the Squire warming), to see things neglected and\r\ndecayed, and going to the dogs! This land we live in is a good mother to\r\nus, and we can't do too much for her. It is very true, neighbors, that I\r\nowe her a good many acres, and ought to speak well of her; but what\r\nthen? I live amongst you, and what I take from the rent with one hand, I\r\ndivide amongst you with the other, (low, but assenting murmurs.) Now the\r\nmore I improve my property, the more mouths it feeds. My\r\ngreat-grandfather kept a Field-Book, in which were entered not only the\r\nnames of all the farmers and the quantity of land they held, but the\r\naverage number of the laborers each employed. My grandfather and father\r\nfollowed his example: I have done the same. I find, neighbors, that our\r\nrents have doubled since my great-grandfather began to make the book.\r\nAy--but there are more than four times the number of laborers employed\r\non the estate, and at much better wages too! Well, my men, that says a\r\ngreat deal in favor of improving property, and not letting it go to the\r\ndogs. (Applause.) And therefore, neighbors, you will kindly excuse my\r\nhobby: it carries grist to your mill. (Reiterated applause.) Well--but\r\nyou will say, 'What's the Squire driving at?' Why this, my friends:\r\nThere was only one worn-out, dilapidated, tumble-down thing in the\r\nParish of Hazeldean, and it became an eyesore to me; so I saddled my\r\nhobby, and rode at it. O ho! you know what I mean now! Yes, but\r\nneighbors, you need not have taken it so to heart. That was a scurvy\r\ntrick of some of you to hang me in effigy, as they call it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It warn't you,\" cried a voice in the crowd, \"it war Nick Stirn.\"\r\n\r\nThe Squire recognized the voice of the tinker; but though he now guessed\r\nat the ringleader,--on that day of general amnesty, he had the prudence\r\nand magnanimity not to say, \"Stand forth, Sprott: thou art the man.\" Yet\r\nhis gallant English spirit would not suffer him to come off at the\r\nexpense of his servant.\r\n\r\n\"If it was Nick Stirn you meant,\" said he gravely, \"more shame for you.\r\nIt showed some pluck to hang the master; but to hang the poor servant,\r\nwho only thought to do his duty, careless of what ill-will it brought\r\nupon him, was a shabby trick--so little like the lads of Hazeldean, that\r\nI suspect the man who taught it to them was never born in the parish.\r\nBut let bygones be bygones. One thing is clear, you don't take kindly to\r\nmy new pair of stocks! They have been a stumbling-block and a grievance,\r\nand there's no denying that we went on very pleasantly without them. I\r\nmay also say that in spite of them we have been coming together again\r\nlately. And I can't tell you what good it did me to see your children\r\nplaying again on the green, and your honest faces, in spite of the\r\nstocks, and those diabolical tracts you've been reading lately, lighted\r\nup at the thought that something pleasant was going on at the Hall. Do\r\nyou know, neighbors, you put me in mind of an old story which, besides\r\napplying to the Parish, all who are married, and all who intend to\r\nmarry, will do well to recollect. A worthy couple, named John and Joan,\r\nhad lived happily together many a long year, till one unlucky day they\r\nbought a new bolster. Joan said the bolster was too hard, and John that\r\nit was too soft. So, of course, they quarrelled. After sulking all day,\r\nthey agreed to put the bolster between them at night.\" (Roars of\r\nlaughter amongst the men; the women did not know which way to look,\r\nexcept, indeed, Mrs. Hazeldean, who, though she was more than usually\r\nrosy, maintained her innocent genial smile, as much as to say, \"There is\r\nno harm in the Squire's jests.\") The orator resumed--\"After they had\r\nthus lain apart for a little time, very silent and sullen, John sneezed.\r\n'God bless you!' says Joan over the bolster. 'Did you say God bless me?'\r\ncries John;--'then here goes the bolster!'\"\r\n\r\nProlonged laughter and tumultuous applause.\r\n\r\n\"Friends and neighbors,\" said the Squire when silence was restored, and\r\nlifting the horn of ale, \"I have the pleasure to inform you that I have\r\nordered the stocks to be taken down, and made into a bench for the\r\nchimney nook of our old friend Gaffer Solomons yonder. But mind me,\r\nlads, if ever you make the Parish regret the loss of the stocks, and the\r\noverseers come to me with long faces and say, 'the stocks must be\r\nrebuilded,' why--\" Here from all the youth of the village rose so\r\ndeprecating a clamor, that the Squire would have been the most bungling\r\norator in the world if he had said a word further on the subject. He\r\nelevated the horn over his head--\"Why, that's my old Hazeldean again!\r\nHealth and long life to you all!\"\r\n\r\nThe Tinker had sneaked out of the assembly, and did not show his face in\r\nthe village for the next six months. And as to those poisonous tracts,\r\nin spite of their salubrious labels, \"the Poor Man's Friend,\" or \"the\r\nRights of Labor,\" you could no more have found one of them lurking in\r\nthe drawers of the kitchen-dressers in Hazeldean, than you would have\r\nfound the deadly nightshade on the flower-stands in the drawing-room of\r\nthe Hall. As for the revolutionary beer-house, there was no need to\r\napply to the magistrates to shut it up; it shut itself up before the\r\nweek was out.\r\n\r\nO young head of the great House of Hapsburg, what a Hazeldean you might\r\nhave made of Hungary! What a \"_Moriamur pro rege nostro_\" would have\r\nrang in your infant reign,--if you had made such a speech as the\r\nSquire's!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[R] The Emperor Diocletian.\r\n\r\n[S] The title of Excellency does not, in Italian, necessarily express\r\nany exalted rank: but it is often given by servants to their masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorical Review of the Month.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this number of the _International_, copying the example of the oldest\r\nmagazine in the world, _The Gentleman's_, which for a hundred years has\r\nfound its account in such a department, we present a carefully prepared\r\nand succinct summary of the history of the world, as it has come to our\r\nknowledge during the past month. It is intended hereafter to continue\r\nthis feature in the _International_, devoting to it such attention that\r\nour pages shall always be deserving of consultation as an authority in\r\nregard to contemporary events. In the general characteristics of this\r\ndepartment we shall offer nothing very original; the examples of our\r\nEnglish contemporaries will be generally adhered to; but the utmost care\r\nand candor will be evinced in every _resume_ of affairs or opinions\r\nadmitted to our pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nAs the session of Congress draws near to its close, its proceedings\r\nbecome more animated and interesting. It is already evident, however,\r\nthat but few of the questions recommended for its consideration can be\r\ndisposed of before its adjournment. One of its most important acts was\r\nthe passage of the Cheap Postage Bill, in the House, on the seventeenth\r\nof January, by a vote of 130 to 75. This bill provides for a uniform\r\nrate of three cents per half-ounce, on letters, and a material reduction\r\nin the rates charged for newspapers and periodicals. The Senate\r\nCommittee to whom the bill was referred, have reported amendments\r\nraising the postage to five cents on unpaid letters, striking out the\r\nprovision allowing newspapers to go free within thirty miles of their\r\nplace of publication, and reducing postage on magazines fifty per cent\r\nwhen prepaid. The French Spoliation Bill, after considerable discussion,\r\npassed the Senate on Friday, January 24th. The bill provides for the\r\npayment of claims based on the detention of vessels in the port of\r\nBordeaux, the forcible capture and detention of American citizens, and\r\ndepredations on American commerce in the West Indies, to the amount of\r\n$5,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe bill to ascertain and settle Private Land Claims in California,\r\nintroduced by Mr. Fremont towards the close of last session, was called\r\nup by Mr. Gwin, his colleague, on the twenty-seventh of January. Mr.\r\nGwin offered a substitute, which was agreed to in Committee of the\r\nWhole, when the bill was reported to the Senate. After a most animated\r\ndebate, in which the bill was strongly opposed by Mr. Benton, it finally\r\npassed the Senate on the sixth of February.\r\n\r\nThe bill introduced in the House for the establishment of Branch Mints\r\nin New-York and San Francisco gave rise to an exciting debate. The bill\r\nwas discussed for several days, the Pennsylvania members opposing it in\r\na body. Its defeat was finally accomplished on Wednesday, February 5th.\r\nSince then Mr. Gwin has introduced in the Senate a separate bill for the\r\nestablishment of a Branch Mint in San Francisco. A joint resolution,\r\nreported to the Senate by Mr. Rusk, providing that dead letters\r\nremaining in the post-offices of California and Oregon shall be opened\r\nat the post-office in San Francisco, under care of a special agent, was\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate, February 5th, the Committee on Foreign Relations, of\r\nwhich Mr. Foote is chairman, reported a resolution that in all future\r\ntreaties by the United States, provisions should be made for settling\r\ndifficulties by arbitration, before resorting to war. The Judiciary\r\nCommittee also reported in favor of Messrs. Winthrop and Ewing (senators\r\nappointed by the governors of Massachusetts and Ohio to fill vacancies)\r\nholding their seats till their regularly-elected successors appear to\r\nclaim their places. Mr. Winthrop, however, on Friday, February 7th,\r\npresented the credentials of his successor, Mr. Rantoul, (who had not\r\nyet arrived,) and vacated his seat. The credentials of Mr. Bright, as\r\nsenator from Indiana for the ensuing term, were presented on the\r\ntwenty-eighth of January.\r\n\r\nA bill for the relief of Mrs. Charlotte Lynch, mother of Miss Anne C.\r\nLynch, the poetess, passed the House by a majority of 11. It had\r\npreviously passed the Senate. Mrs. Lynch is the only surviving child of\r\nColonel Ebenezer Gray, of the Connecticut line, who served in the army\r\nof the Revolution. The bill provides five years' full pay, as an\r\nequivalent for the losses sustained by him through the substitution of\r\nthe commutation certificates issued in 1783.\r\n\r\nThe American Minister at Rio Janeiro has transmitted some important\r\ninformation to the Government in regard to the Brazilian traffic in\r\nslaves under the American flag. A considerable portion of the infamous\r\ntrade, by which from forty to fifty thousand negroes are annually\r\nimported into Brazil, is carried on in American-built vessels, under the\r\nprotection of our flag. It has been found impossible to enforce the\r\nBrazilian statutes on the subject, the authorities charged with their\r\nexecution, almost without exception, conniving at the traffic. In spite\r\nof the exertions of the American Minister, our flag is still used as a\r\nprotection, and its influence is given to the support of the\r\nslave-dealer. The communications of the American Minister have been\r\nreferred by the Senate to the Committee on Commerce. Mr. Clay spoke at\r\nsome length in favor of adopting more efficient measures to prevent\r\nAmerican vessels and seamen from engaging in the slave-trade.\r\n\r\nThe project of establishing a line of steamers between several American\r\nports and the coast of Africa, Gibraltar, and England,--familiarly known\r\nas the \"Ebony Line,\"--has been strongly recommended to Congress by\r\npetitions from all quarters. The Legislature of Virginia, and the\r\nConstitutional Convention of the same State, now in session, have both\r\npassed resolutions in its favor. Several other States have done, or are\r\nabout to do the same thing. The session is already so far advanced,\r\nhowever, that the subject will probably be left without action for the\r\nnext Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Senate Committee on the Post-office has reported in favor of\r\ngranting to a company the right of way and subscription to the stock of\r\nan Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Company.\r\n\r\nMr. Kaufman, a member of the House, from Texas, died very suddenly on\r\nthe thirty-first of January. His funeral took place on the Monday\r\nfollowing, February 3d. Mr. Kaufman was born in Pennsylvania in 1813,\r\ngraduated in Princeton College in 1833, practiced law in Louisiana, and\r\nremoved to Texas in 1835.\r\n\r\nThe subject of most general interest in the political world is the\r\nelection of United States Senator, in a number of the States, for the\r\nterm commencing on the 4th of March. Several elections have taken place,\r\nand others have not been accomplished in spite of repeated ballots. In\r\nNew-York, the Constitution provides for an election on the first\r\nWednesday of February. On that day the Whig candidate, ex-Governor\r\nHamilton Fish, received a majority of 37 in the House: the Senate, after\r\ntwo ineffectual ballots, adjourned. A special law will therefore be\r\nrequired to elect a senator. In Massachusetts, the Democratic candidate,\r\nRobert Rantoul, Jr., was elected to fill the vacancy occasioned by Mr.\r\nWebster's acceptance of a place in the Cabinet. All attempts to elect a\r\nsenator for the ensuing term have failed up to this period. Mr. Sumner,\r\nthe Free Soil candidate, lacked but two votes of an election on the\r\ntwelfth ballot, but afterwards lost. It was finally postponed to the\r\ntwenty-seventh of February. In the Ohio Legislature, ten successive\r\nballots were cast without arriving at an election, after which the\r\nsubject was indefinitely postponed. In Rhode Island, General Charles T.\r\nJames, the Democratic candidate, was elected; in Florida, Stephen R.\r\nMallory, in place of Hon. D. L. Yulee, both Democrats; and in Delaware,\r\nJames A. Bayard, Democrat, in the place of Mr. Wales, the present Whig\r\nsenator. Hon. Henry Dodge was reelected by the Legislature of Wisconsin,\r\nby a majority of one, on the fifth vote. In Pennsylvania, Hon. Richard\r\nBrodhead was elected in place of Mr. Sturgeon, both members of the\r\nDemocratic party. Henry S. Geyer, Whig, has been elected by the State of\r\nMissouri, as United States Senator, in place of Col. Thomas H. Benton,\r\nwho is superseded after an uninterrupted service of thirty years.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Ross, the new Governor of Delaware, was inaugurated at Dover,\r\non the twenty-first of January. The most important feature of his\r\naddress was the recommendation of a revision of the State Constitution.\r\nGeorge F. Fort, the new Governor of New Jersey, has been inaugurated.\r\nHis address takes ground in favor of the compromise measures passed by\r\nCongress. He also advocates the Free School System, and the election of\r\nJudges by the people. Governor French, of Illinois, in his annual\r\nmessage, represents the State as being in a prosperous condition, the\r\nrevenue being sufficient to meet the demands upon the treasury. He\r\nrecommends a geological survey of the State, and the passage of a\r\nHomestead Exemption Law. The schools of the State are in a flourishing\r\ncondition. The message of Governor Dewey, of Wisconsin, also shows an\r\nimproved condition of State affairs. The finances are represented as\r\nbeing sound, and the credit of the State relieved from all fear of\r\nbankruptcy. Apprehensions of danger to the citizens residing north of\r\nWisconsin river, from the return of the Winnebagoes, have been quieted\r\nby the appointment of an agent to confer with that tribe. The message of\r\nGovernor Ramsey to the second Legislative Assembly of Minnesota\r\nTerritory is an interesting document. Among other subjects recommended\r\nto the attention of the Assembly are the agricultural interests of the\r\nTerritory, and the improvement of the Mississippi river, both above and\r\nbelow the Falls of St. Anthony. The extinction of the Indian title at\r\nPembina will admit of the laws of the Territory being extended over the\r\nhalf-breeds at that place. It is said that there are hundreds of\r\nhalf-breed hunters on the British side of the line, who are only waiting\r\nthe extinction of the Indian title to change their homes and allegiance.\r\nThe assessed value of property in the five principal counties of\r\nMinnesota is $805,417.48.\r\n\r\nThe returns of the Seventh Census will shortly be completed. A number of\r\nStates have recently sent in their full reports, among which are the\r\nfollowing: New-York 3,099,000, being an increase of 670,029 since 1840;\r\nVirginia 1,428,863, an increase of 189,066; Maryland 580,633, an\r\nincrease of 111,401; New Hampshire 317,999, an increase of 33,425;\r\nMissouri 681,547, an increase of 297,845; Ohio 1,981,940, an increase of\r\n462,473; Kentucky 993,344, an increase of 213,516; Indiana, 990,000; New\r\nJersey 490,763, an increase of 117,874; and Wisconsin, 305,556. The\r\nentire population of the United States in 1850 is estimated at\r\n23,500,000.\r\n\r\nA warrant for the arrest of Governor Quitman of Mississippi, for\r\nparticipation in the Cuban Expedition, was issued by Judge Gholson in\r\nNew Orleans, early in January. Governor Quitman at first resisted the\r\nauthority, but afterwards resigned his office as Governor, and on the\r\nseventh of February reached New Orleans, under arrest. He appeared in\r\ncourt, and gave bail for future appearance, asking a speedy trial.\r\n\r\nSeveral diplomatic appointments have recently been made. Hon. Richard H.\r\nBayard, who was appointed Charge d'Affaires to Belgium, has departed for\r\nhis mission. Hon. Robert C. Schenck, of Ohio, has been appointed\r\nMinister to Brazil, and Hon. J. S. Pendleton, of Virginia, Charge\r\nd'Affaires to New Grenada. The Chevalier Gomez, Special Envoy to Rome\r\nfrom the states of Guatemala and San Salvador, has arrived at\r\nWashington, and assumed, provisionally, the office of Charge from those\r\nstates. He has addressed a letter to the Secretary of State in relation\r\nto the present condition of the Central American States.\r\n\r\nGeneral Mosquera, ex-President of New Grenada, is now travelling in this\r\ncountry, and was lately in Washington, where he received distinguished\r\nattentions. General Paez, the distinguished exile from Venezuela, is\r\nalso in Washington. Dr. Frank Taylor, of Pennsylvania, who has recently\r\nreturned from Constantinople and Asia Minor, has received letters from\r\nthe illustrious Kossuth, addressed to the Secretary of State, and\r\nsoliciting the intervention of the United States with the Turkish\r\nGovernment, to procure the release of himself and his compatriots, and\r\ntheir transportation to the United States. Mr. Webster immediately\r\ncomplied with the request, and has dispatched instructions to Mr. Marsh,\r\nthe American Minister at Constantinople, to procure from the Turkish\r\nGovernment the release of the Hungarians.\r\n\r\nThe frigate St. Lawrence has sailed from New-York for Southampton, with\r\narticles for the World's Fair. She carries out between four and five\r\nhundred articles, embracing nearly all branches of manufacture, and the\r\nprincipal mineral and agricultural productions of the country. The\r\ncontributions are in charge of Charles F. Stansbury, Esq., agent of the\r\nCentral Committee of Washington. The tender of the authorities of\r\nSouthampton, offering the use of that port, with free transportation of\r\nthe goods to Vauxhall, London, has been accepted by the Secretary of\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThere have been several serious wrecks, with loss of life, on the\r\nAtlantic coast and the Mississippi river. The steamboat America, which\r\nleft Wilmington, N.C., on the fourteenth of January, for Mobile,\r\nfoundered on the 29th. The schooner Champion, of Boston, picked up one\r\nboat's crew, containing six men. A second boat, containing ten men, was\r\npicked up by the schooner Star, and taken to Washington. A third boat,\r\ncontaining six men, has not been heard from. The steamer John Adams, on\r\nher way from New Orleans to Cincinnati, struck on a snag in the\r\nMississippi river, on the morning of January 27th. The cabin parted from\r\nthe hull, which went down in sixty feet water. Out of 230 cabin and deck\r\npassengers, firemen, and crew, 123 were lost, of whom 82 were German and\r\nIrish emigrants, and returning Californians. On the ninth of February,\r\nthe steamer Autocrat, from New Orleans to Memphis, came in contact with\r\nthe steamer Magnolia, coming down the river, and sank instantly. Thirty\r\nlives were lost.\r\n\r\nA calamitous fire took place at New Orleans, on the eighteenth of\r\nJanuary, destroying the magnificent St. Charles Hotel, together with two\r\nchurches and several other buildings. The total loss is about $500,000,\r\nless than half of which was covered by insurance. Jenny Lind arrived at\r\nNew Orleans from Havana on the 8th of February. Her reception was in the\r\nhighest degree enthusiastic. Her first concert took place on the 10th,\r\nthe receipts therefrom amounting to $20,000. The first ticket was\r\npurchased for $240 by a New Orleans hatter, the fortunate drawer of\r\nPowers' Greek Slave in the Cincinnati Art Union.\r\n\r\nTwo more of the unfortunate Hungarian refugees have reached this city:\r\nCaptain Eduard Becsey, who served during the war as adjutant to General\r\nBern, and Lieutenant Aurel Kiring. Captain Becsey was taken prisoner by\r\nthe Russians, and carried to Kiev, on the Dneiper, where he was detained\r\na year. After being released, he made his way to the Mediterranean, and\r\nobtained a passage to New-York.\r\n\r\nOur latest news from Eagle Harbor, the port of the mining region on Lake\r\nSuperior, state that the propeller Independence, which had just taken\r\non board her last cargo of copper for the season, was blown on shore by\r\na heavy gale, and imbedded in the sand, where she must remain till\r\nSpring. The Napoleon had arrived from Saut St. Mary, with provisions and\r\nstores for the winter.\r\n\r\nTexas papers of the thirty-first of January state that Judge Rollins,\r\nthe United States Agent, had effected a treaty with the Indians,\r\nproviding for a cessation of hostilities, and the restoration of all\r\nstolen property and prisoners. Lieuts. Smith and Mechler had completed a\r\nsurvey of the Rio Grande from its mouth to a point about four hundred\r\nand fifty miles above Camargo. They report that the river can be made\r\nnavigable for boats of light draught to a short distance above Loredo\r\nfor several months in the year. Col. Anderson, of the corps of\r\nTopographical Engineers has received orders to make a survey of the\r\nBrazos and Guadalupe rivers. A fight had occurred between Lieutenant\r\nKing, with seven men, of the Texan volunteers, and a body of Indians,\r\nwho were driving off a number of stolen horses. They were pursued for\r\nfifteen or twenty miles, when they abandoned the horses, and escaped\r\nwith the loss of three or four of their number. The total vote on the\r\nPierce Boundary Bill, as officially reported, is 9,250 ayes, 3,366 noes.\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth of December the whole of the American Boundary\r\nCommission had arrived at Paso del Norte, with the exception of an\r\nox-train carrying supplies. The military escort, under the command of\r\nCol. Craig, was encamped on the American side of the Rio del Norte, but\r\nwas soon to start for the copper-mines near the headwaters of the Gila.\r\nThe Mexican Commissioner, General Conde, with his escort, was quartered\r\nin the town of El Paso. Several conferences took place between the\r\nCommissioners before they could agree on the starting-point for the\r\nboundary, the existing maps being as inconsistent with the terms of the\r\ntreaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo as with the topography of the country\r\nitself. The winter, throughout the valley of the Del Norte has been very\r\nsevere. The thermometer fell to six degrees at El Paso on the sixth of\r\nDecember, and the Rio Grande was frozen over for the first time in the\r\nmemory of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe settlements of New Mexico are threatened with scarcity. On the tenth\r\nof January corn was selling at three dollars the bushel, and vegetables\r\nnot to be had at any price. The appearance of the agents for taking the\r\ncensus of New-Mexico had occasioned great alarm among the pueblos or\r\nvillages. They feared that the account of their property was taken by\r\nthe Government for the purpose of extortion and seizure. The Apaches\r\nhave committed no depredations of late, but the Navajoes have broken\r\ntheir treaty by stealing several thousand sheep from the settlements on\r\nthe Rio del Norte.\r\n\r\nIn the Utah Territory the Mormons have temporarily settled the question\r\nof slavery, by leaving it to the choice of the slaves themselves. If the\r\nslave chooses to leave his master, there is no power to retain him; if\r\nhe chooses to stay, no one is allowed to interfere.\r\n\r\nOur news from California is to the first of January. The steamers\r\nCarolina and Columbus sailed from San Francisco on that day, with 330\r\npassengers and about $1,500,000 in gold dust. Business was very dull,\r\nboth in the ports and inland towns of California, and the trading\r\ncommunities among the mines. The immense shipments of goods which had\r\narrived from the Atlantic States had produced a complete stagnation in\r\nthe market, bringing many kinds of merchandise below cost prices. After\r\nthe first showers of the rainy season, early in December, the miners\r\nwithdrew to the dry diggings, when the rains ceased, and three or four\r\nweeks of clear and delightful weather left them without employment. The\r\nrichest localities are very thickly populated, the miners having built\r\nthemselves log-cabins and organized communities for the winter. On parts\r\nof Feather river, the American Fork, and the Mokelumne, Tuolumne, and\r\nMariposa rivers, the diggings were still yielding a good return. New\r\ndiscoveries of rich veins of quartz-bearing gold continue to be made. A\r\nmine of silver ore, of a very rich quality, is reported to have been\r\ndiscovered in the neighborhood of Monterey. A company is being formed at\r\nthat place for the purpose of working the mine upon an extensive scale.\r\nThe Sacramento papers state that a large mine of lead, in an almost pure\r\nstate, exists near Johnson's Ranche, about thirty miles from that city.\r\nThe ore is represented to lie on the surface of the earth, in heavy\r\nmasses, so that vast quantities could be obtained without sinking a\r\nshaft.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of December 14th another fire broke out in San Francisco,\r\nin a large zinc building owned by Cooke, Baker & Co. By the exertions of\r\nthe firemen and the citizens the conflagration was subdued, after\r\nconsuming this building and three or four others of less value. The\r\nlarge building belonging to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company was in\r\nthe utmost danger, having been greatly scorched by the flames. The total\r\nloss by this fire was $75,000. The city, on the first of January, was\r\nfully prepared for the rainy season. By the enterprise of the\r\ninhabitants, upward of seven and a half miles of street had been graded\r\nand four miles planked, while capacious piers and wharves were built far\r\nout into the bay, so that vessels were enabled to load and unload\r\nwithout the use of lighters. The cholera had entirely disappeared, not\r\nonly from San Francisco, but from all parts of California. Its ravages\r\nhave been much lighter than was anticipated, a fact which speaks well\r\nfor the health of the country.\r\n\r\nThe _Pacific News_ contains some interesting statistics of the condition\r\nof San Francisco at the close of the year 1850. The population of the\r\ncity is estimated at 35,000. One hundred and seven miles of street are\r\nalready laid out, one quarter of which is built upon and occupied. The\r\nbusiness streets are substantially built of brick or iron. In addition\r\nto seventeen large auction firms and eight express companies, the city\r\nboasts of ten first class hotels and seven daily papers. The amount of\r\ngold-dust regularly shipped and entered for exportation during the year\r\n1850 was $30,000,000; the estimated amount taken away by passengers,\r\n$12,000,000. The amount of bullion received was $1,722,600. The number\r\nof vessels which arrived during the year was 1,743 bringing 35,333 male\r\nand 1,248 female passengers; the number of clearances amounts to 1,461\r\nvessels, carrying away 26,593 male and eight female passengers. The\r\ntotal value of the merchandise received by foreign and domestic vessels\r\nduring the year was between four and five millions of dollars. In\r\naddition to 14 steamers running regularly between San Francisco and\r\nPanama, and three on the Oregon route, there are 45 steamers and 270\r\nother craft of various kinds on the bay and inland streams.\r\n\r\nWe have news from Oregon to the middle of December, at which time the\r\nLegislature was in session. The message of Governor Gaines recommends\r\nthe establishment of a liberal system of education, and asks for the\r\npassage of a law for protection against the Indian tribes. It also\r\nmaintains the importance of a liberal policy on the part of the General\r\nGovernment in the donation of lands to actual settlers. The country\r\nappears to be in a highly prosperous condition; all the towns on the\r\nColumbia and its tributaries are growing rapidly. The news from the gold\r\nplacers on the Klamath and Umpqua rivers, near the borders of\r\nCalifornia, is encouraging as to the yield of dust, but the Oregonians\r\nplace their main reliance on their agricultural interests. The yield of\r\nwheat is said to be not only double per acre that of the Atlantic\r\nStates, but it is a never-failing crop. The people in Oregon City are\r\nagitating the subject of a railroad to connect the Willamette Valley\r\nwith the Columbia river, at some point accessible to large vessels. It\r\nis estimated that the whole cost will only be about $500,000, which it\r\nis proposed to raise in one thousand shares of $500 each. Twelve months,\r\nit is believed, will complete the work.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUROPE.\r\n\r\nOn the first of February, England was in a tranquil condition, the\r\nanti-Papal agitation having almost entirely subsided. The journals were\r\nengaged in discussing law reform, the New-York Revised Code being\r\ncommended as a model in many quarters. In the Queen's speech at the\r\nopening of Parliament--an advance copy having been forwarded to this\r\ncountry--a thorough reform of the Equity courts is recommended, as well\r\nas the introduction of an act for the registration of deeds, equally\r\napplicable to each of the three kingdoms. Her Majesty alludes in terms\r\nof comparative mildness to the Wiseman affair, commending the question\r\nto the attention of Parliament. Public opinion is strongly in favor of a\r\nlarge reduction in taxation, and it is anticipated that the window tax\r\nwill be abolished. The quarterly returns of the revenue have been highly\r\nsatisfactory, since, notwithstanding the abolition of the tax on bricks\r\nand the reduction of the stamp duty, the income exceeds that of the\r\nprevious year by about L165,000.\r\n\r\nThe great crystal palace in Hyde Park is rapidly advancing towards its\r\ncompletion. The immense structure is exciting the wonder and admiration\r\nof the metropolis, and the opening of the fair is anticipated with great\r\ninterest. The strength of the building has been amply tested by a severe\r\nstorm of hail and wind, which passed over without breaking a pane of\r\nglass. All quarters of the world are sending specimens of their\r\nmanufactures and natural productions. South Africa, Australia, and the\r\nislands of the sea will be represented, while Cashmere shawls, robes of\r\npearl, and Runjeet Singh's golden saddle, will be sent from India.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Mail steamer Atlantic, which sailed from Liverpool on the\r\ntwenty-eighth of December, arrived in the harbor of Cork on the\r\ntwenty-second of January, having been at sea twenty-five days. When in\r\nlat. 46 deg. 12', lon. 41 deg. 30', about midway between Cape Clear and\r\nNew-York, her main shaft broke, rendering the engines useless. After\r\nrunning westward two days under sail, a heavy gale arose, when Captain\r\nWest put her head about, and made for Cork, a distance of 1400 miles,\r\nwhich she made in eleven days. The steamer Cambria was instantly\r\nchartered to take her place, but most of her passengers left Liverpool\r\nin the Africa, on February 1st. It is stated on the authority of Earl\r\nMonteagle, that the British Government have resolved to make Holyhead\r\nthe port of arrival and departure for the transatlantic mail steamers.\r\n\r\nIn France, a ministerial revolution has taken place, resulting in\r\nwidening the breach between President Napoleon and the National\r\nAssembly. Several general orders of General Changarnier to the army of\r\nParis having been published in one of the journals, in which he commands\r\nthe troops to pay no attention to any orders but those of the\r\nLieutenant-General. Changarnier was called upon in the Assembly for\r\nexplanation. He denied that these instructions were meant to be\r\npermanent, but only to be put in force when an emeute was apprehended.\r\nHis conduct was approved by the Assembly, but Louis Napoleon, who had\r\nlong regarded Changarnier with fear and jealousy, withdrew from him the\r\ncommand of the army at Paris, which he divided between two or three\r\ngenerals of lower rank. This gave rise to a most excited debate in the\r\nNational Assembly, in which Lamartine made a speech in the President's\r\ndefence. Baroche, Minister of the Interior, General Changarnier, M.\r\nThiers, and General Cavaignac followed, the three latter speakers taking\r\nstrong ground against the ministry. After several days of stormy\r\ndiscussion, the resolution of M. de St. Beuve, that the Assembly\r\n\"declares that it has no confidence in the ministry,\" was carried by a\r\nmajority of 139. The ministers tendered their resignation to the\r\nPresident the same evening. A ministerial interregnum followed, which\r\nwas terminated on the twenty-fourth of January by a message of the\r\nPresident, appointing a \"transition ministry,\" composed of employees\r\nfrom the different departments, not one of them having a seat in the\r\nAssembly. The following is the list, as given in the _Moniteur_:\r\n\r\n    Public Instruction            M. Giraud, (de l'Institute.)\r\n    Interior                      M. Vaisse.\r\n    Foreign Affairs               M. Brennier.\r\n    War                           General Randon.\r\n    Marine                        Admiral Levaillant.\r\n    Commerce                      M. Schneider.\r\n    Finances                      M. de Germiny.\r\n    Public Works                  M. Magne.\r\n    Justice                       M. de Royer.\r\n\r\nLamartine, it is stated, was urged by Louis Napoleon to accept an\r\nappointment in the ministry, but declined on account of his being bound\r\nto furnish his publishers with two volumes a month, under heavy\r\npenalties.\r\n\r\nThe Conference of the German States at Dresden was opened with much\r\nceremony early in January. All the states were represented, but the\r\nnegotiations were kept profoundly secret. It has transpired, however,\r\nthat the formation of the new Diet agreed upon gives two votes to\r\nPrussia, two to Austria, one each to Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover, and\r\nWurtemberg, and three more portioned among the smaller principalities,\r\nmaking eleven in all. It is also understood that a Provisional Central\r\nPower will be proclaimed, Prussia and Austria retaining to themselves\r\nexclusively the right of deciding for the Confederation all questions\r\nof peace and war.\r\n\r\nAustria still labors under financial embarrassments of an almost\r\nhopeless character. As a measure of temporary relief, the Government has\r\ncontracted two loans, one from Russia, of fifty millions of florins, and\r\nthe other, of one hundred millions, on state obligations, at six per\r\ncent. The manufacturers of Austria strongly oppose the proposed\r\ncompromise of the Zollverein, and advocate a tariff of a decidedly\r\nprotective character. Great dissatisfaction has been manifested in\r\nHungary, on account of the newly imposed tax on tobacco, which is one of\r\nthe principal productions of the country. In consequence of this\r\nopposition the excise corps has been greatly enlarged, and serious\r\ndifficulties are apprehended.\r\n\r\nThe smaller German states are now completely overruled by the Austrian\r\nand Prussian troops. The Elector of Hesse Cassel has returned to his\r\nCapital, with his Prime Minister, Hassenpflug, under their protection.\r\nThe Constitution is virtually abolished by their presence, and those who\r\nsupported it are subjected to the most shameful persecutions. Many of\r\nthe best citizens are obliged to leave the country. Schleswig Holstein\r\nhas been 'pacified' in a similar manner. Through the instrumentality of\r\nthe Austrian and Prussian Commissioners, backed by a military force, the\r\narmy of Schleswig Holstein has been disbanded, and the country occupied\r\nby the troops of Denmark. On the sixteenth of January, the proclamation\r\nof the King of Denmark, administering the oath of fidelity to the\r\nmilitary, was read in the marketplace of Rendsburg. Hamburgh has been\r\noccupied by 4000 Austrian troops.\r\n\r\nA treaty of amity and commerce has been concluded with the Swiss Diet,\r\nby Mr. Dudley Mann, Diplomatic Agent of the United States. Its\r\nprovisions are of the most liberal and friendly character. The entire\r\nreciprocity and equality of the citizens of both countries, is\r\nguaranteed, so far as the right of establishment is concerned; a citizen\r\nof the United States being allowed to settle in one of the Swiss Cantons\r\nupon the same conditions as a citizen born in another Canton. Entire and\r\nunconditional liberty in disposing of property is mutually stipulated,\r\nas well as equal taxation of the individuals established, their\r\nexemption from military duties, and the grant of indemnity for damages\r\nin case of war. The commercial intercourse of the two countries is also\r\narranged upon the most liberal and advantageous basis. Switzerland has\r\nremained tranquil, with the exception of a riot in the Canton of Berne,\r\noccasioned by the attempted extradition, on the part of the Government,\r\nof a Prussian Jew, a noted socialist, residing at St. Imier. This person\r\nwas very popular among the poor, who resisted the authorities, whereupon\r\nthe troops were ordered to be in readiness to support them. The Swiss\r\nGovernment has determined to forward a beautiful stone from the Alps, to\r\nbe placed in the National Monument to Washington.\r\n\r\nITALY is still in an unquiet state. There seems to be a growing\r\napprehension and uneasiness among all classes in the Papal States, and\r\nit is rumored that Pope Pius, wearied with the anxieties of his\r\nsituation, wishes to resign the Pontificate, and retire to a Convent.\r\n\r\nIn NAPLES, the Government, alarmed by rumors of Mazzini's revolutionary\r\ndesigns, has made many arrests, and instituted a more vigorous police\r\nsystem. All cafes and places of public amusement are strictly watched.\r\nThe army is to be increased by 18,000 men, and as English opinions are\r\nassigned to be dangerous, those Neapolitans who intended to visit the\r\nGreat Exhibition in London, have been refused their passports.\r\n\r\nAUSTRIAN ITALY is even in a worse condition. Several conspiracies have\r\nbeen discovered, and a large number of arrests made in consequence. A\r\nlarge number of persons have been executed, in the Lombardo-Venetian\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting news from SPAIN is that of another resignation of\r\nthe Ministry. The resignation of General Narvaez was not accepted by the\r\nQueen, whereupon that gentleman assembled his colleagues, and\r\ncommissioned them to inform the Queen that unless she released him at\r\nonce from his office, he should blow his brains out! This threat had the\r\ndesired effect, and the following Cabinet was then appointed:\r\n\r\n    President of the Council and Minister of Finance   Bravo Murillo.\r\n    Foreign Office                                     Bertran de Lys.\r\n    Grace and Justice                                  Gonzales Romero.\r\n    Home Department                                    Arteta.\r\n    War                                                Count Mirasol.\r\n    Marine                                             Bustillos.\r\n    Commerce, &c.                                      Fernandez Negrete.\r\n\r\nThe project of a revision of the Constitution, which has been so warmly\r\nagitated in Sweden, has entirely failed. The proposition of the King has\r\nbeen rejected by two of the four chambers constituting the Legislative\r\nAssembly, three being required in its favor, to form a constitutional\r\nmajority. Sweden will therefore preserve her present system of a\r\nseparate representation of the nobility, clergy, citizens, and peasants.\r\n\r\nIn TURKEY, the subjection of the rebellious Bosnians was consummated on\r\nthe seventeenth of December, when Omar Pasha made his triumphal entry\r\ninto Bosna Serai. The captive Pashas and Cadis marched on foot in the\r\nprocession. It is rumored that the Porte has at length agreed to accept\r\nthe offer of the British and American Governments to transport the\r\nHungarian refugees to America, and will order their immediate release.\r\nThree hundred Polish refugees, who arrived at Constantinople from Varna,\r\non the thirty-first of December, were to be sent to Liverpool at the\r\nexpense of the Turkish Government. Two Commissioners, Ismet Pasha and\r\nSami Pasha, have been appointed to travel through Asiatic and European\r\nTurkey, for the purpose of noting whether the new reforms in favor of\r\nthe Christians have been carried out.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing from GREECE, but accounts of the depredations of the\r\nrobbers which now infest all parts of the country. In the provinces of\r\nAcarnania, Levadia and Attica, several villages have been sacked, and\r\nthe inhabitants put to the torture.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEXICO\r\n\r\nThe Mexican Congress assembled in the Capital on the first of January,\r\nwhen General Herrera, the President, made his annual address. He dwelt\r\nwith satisfaction on the relations existing between the United States\r\nand Mexico, considering them much more harmonious and mutually\r\nadvantageous than was anticipated at the close of the war. The financial\r\ncondition of the country has been somewhat improved by the retrenchment\r\nof the Government expenses and the consolidation of the Interior Debt: a\r\nrevision of the Revenue Laws is strongly advocated as a still further\r\nreform in this direction. President Herrera favors the colonization of\r\nthe public lands by immigrants from Europe; he also alludes with\r\nsatisfaction to the increase of manufactures and the improved prospects\r\nof the silver mines, which last year yielded upwards of $30,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe two branches of Congress met on the eighth, to count the votes for\r\nthe election of the President of the Republic. The votes of twelve\r\nStates were found to be in favor of General Arista. He was consequently\r\ndeclared to be duly elected. On the fifteenth, in the Chamber of\r\nDeputies, in the presence of the Mexican Congress, he took the oath of\r\noffice and made a short inaugural address, in which he alluded to the\r\nmaintenance of the federal system as necessary to the prosperity of the\r\ncountry, and pledged himself to preserve peace and order at all hazards.\r\nThe President of Congress, Don Mariano Yanez, replied in a short address\r\nof congratulation. Te Deum was chanted in the Cathedral in the presence\r\nof the new President, and in the evening the German residents honored\r\nhim with a serenade and torch light procession. Arista's Cabinet is\r\ncomposed as follows: Minister of Foreign Affairs, Don Mariano Yanez;\r\nMinister of Justice, Don Jose Maria Aguirre; Minister of Finance, Don\r\nManuel Payno; Minister of War and Marine, Don Manuel Robles.\r\n\r\nEarly in January a rebellion broke out in the State of Guanajuato. The\r\ninsurgents, headed by two brothers named Liceagas, obtained possession\r\nof the city of Guanajuato, with the Government arms and ammunition, but\r\nwere defeated on the night of the 13th by the Government troops under\r\nGenerals Bustamente and Uraga. Several of the chiefs were executed, and\r\nthe movement, which was in favor of Santa Anna, was entirely crushed.\r\n\r\nThe Tehuantepec treaty was ratified on the 25th of January. On the\r\nfollowing day, Mr. Letcher, the American Minister, left the capital for\r\nthe United States, on leave of absence. Senor Lacunza, the Ex-Minister\r\nof Foreign Affairs, has been appointed Minister to England, and Senor\r\nValdiviesco Minister to France. The Mexican Government has ceded in\r\nperpetuity to Don Gayetano Rubio, Don Eustace Barron, Senor Garay, and\r\nthe firm of Yecker, Torre & Co., the whole of the public lands in the\r\nState of Sonora, including the mines, between lat. 30 deg. N. and the Gila\r\nRiver. This grant embraces several millions of acres, and the richest\r\nmineral land of the Republic. It is said to have been intended to smooth\r\nthe passage of a bill abolishing all tariff prohibitions, which have\r\nhitherto operated greatly to the advantage of the parties named.\r\n\r\nMaj. Barnard's Company for surveying the Isthmus of Tehuantepec reached\r\nthe town of Minatitlan, on the Coatzocoalcos River, in the steamer\r\nAlabama, on the 25th of December. At the last accounts, one party had\r\npenetrated a distance of sixty miles into the country, a second was\r\nengaged in an examination of the river, and a third had set out for\r\nTehuantepec, on the Pacific Coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nThe lawyers in Lower Canada have been making strikes and holding\r\nmeetings to protest against the imposition of the new tariff regulating\r\ntheir fees. The Bar of Quebec and of Trois Rivieres have struck,\r\ndeclining to serve their clients until the legality of the tariff shall\r\nbe decided by the Court of Appeals. It has been decided to admit\r\nAmerican reprints of English copyright works into Canada, on paying 20\r\nper cent. duty, which is to be paid over by the Custom House to the\r\nEnglish authors or proprietors of copyright, who are required to furnish\r\na list of their works. Under this law, American reprints will still be\r\nmuch cheaper than English editions, and popular English authors may\r\ntherefore look forward to some increase of their revenue. The Imperial\r\nCabinet has also assented to the Post-Office Law, enacted at the last\r\nSession of the Canadian Legislature, and establishing a uniform rate of\r\nthree pence for single letters throughout the British Provinces.\r\n\r\nMeetings have been held in Toronto, protesting against the intended\r\nremoval of the Seat of Government from that city, while, on the other\r\nhand, the French members have resolved not to vote the supplies unless\r\nit is removed to Quebec in the spring. Lord Elgin, however, has stated\r\nthat the Seat of Government will be transferred to Quebec at the\r\ncompletion of its two years in Toronto.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEST INDIES.\r\n\r\nWe have news from Havana to the 3d of February. The administration of\r\nGen. Concha appears to be more liberal and energetic than that of his\r\npredecessor, and gives very general satisfaction.\r\n\r\nJenny Lind gave but four concerts in Havana, only the first and last of\r\nwhich were well attended. Her Italian songs produced much more effect\r\nthan her Swedish ballads. The proceeds of the last concert, amounting to\r\n$5000, was devoted to objects of charity. A grand ball was given in her\r\nhonor by the Count de Penalver, after which she visited Matanzas and the\r\nextensive sugar plantations in its neighborhood. Senor Salvi, the great\r\ntenor, was engaged by Mr. Barnum to sing at her concerts in New-York, in\r\nApril. On the 1st February, Frederika Bremer reached Havana, and the two\r\nrenowned Swedes met, for the first time in the new world.\r\n\r\nNews from Jamaica to the 1st of February state that the cholera was\r\nstill prevailing in many localities, although it had decreased in some\r\nand entirely disappeared in others.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL AMERICA--THE ISTHMUS.\r\n\r\nIn the State of Nicaragua, the elections have taken place and Don Jose\r\nSacasa has been chosen Director, from the 1st of May, on which the term\r\nof Director Raminez expires. The National Convention of Delegates from\r\nthe States of Nicaragua, Honduras and San Salvador, met at Chinandega on\r\nthe 21st of December, and organized by choosing as President Don Jose\r\nBarrundia, the author of the Central-American Constitution of 1820. The\r\nlittle steamer Director, belonging to the Nicaraguan Company, passed the\r\nrapids of Machuca, on San Juan River, and entered Lake Nicaragua on the\r\n1st of January. She is now running between Granada and San Carlos, a\r\ndistance of 95 miles, at $20 a passenger. The engineers employed to\r\nsurvey the route of the proposed ship canal, were at work between\r\nGranada and San Juan del Sur, on the Pacific. By the 1st of January,\r\nupwards of four thousand returning Californians had passed through\r\nNicaragua, on their way to the United States.\r\n\r\nDisturbances have broken out in some of the mountain provinces of\r\nGuatemala, growing out of the refusal of the inhabitants to concur in\r\nthe policy adopted by the Government at the instance of the English\r\nconsul, Mr. Chatfield. The insurgents declared in favor of a Federal\r\nUnion of all the Central-American States. The Government troops, under\r\nGen. Carrera, in attempting to put down this opposition, were defeated\r\nat Chiquimula. A blockade of the ports of San Salvador has been ordered\r\nby Mr. Chatfield, who threatens Honduras and Nicaragua with a similar\r\nblow, unless they accede to certain demands. In a letter to the\r\nNicaraguan Minister of Foreign Affairs, he arbitrarily lays down the\r\nboundary line between Honduras, Nicaragua and Musquitia--an assumed\r\nkingdom, under cover of which the British authorities have taken\r\npossession of the port of San Juan. Mr. Chatfield states that unless\r\nthese boundaries are accepted, no canal or other improved method of\r\ntransit across the Isthmus can be established. There is much excitement\r\nin Central America, on account of his arbitrary course.\r\n\r\nThe winter rains are at an end on the Isthmus of Panama, and the roads\r\nare in good condition. Upwards of 800 workmen are employed on the Panama\r\nRailroad, and the track is already prepared for the rails from Navy Bay,\r\nthe Atlantic terminus, to Gatun, on the Chagres River, a distance of\r\nthree and a half miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of VENEZUELA met on 20th of January, all the members being\r\npresent. It had previously been feared that the Executive Power would be\r\nviolently seized by Guzman, Vice-President of the Republic, who was one\r\nof the unsuccessful candidates in the electoral colleges, in case there\r\nshould not be a quorum in Congress. Gen. Monagas, brother of the present\r\nExecutive, lacked only two or three votes of the two-thirds required by\r\nthe Constitution in the electoral colleges, and having received\r\nsixty-five out of the eighty votes of Congress, was declared elected\r\nPresident of Venezuela. Guzman, who had used all his power to defeat\r\nMonagas, notwithstanding he was indebted to the latter for his life, met\r\nhim upon the steps of the Government House after the election, and\r\nbegged pardon, in tears, for the injuries he had done him. Monagas\r\nforgave him, and the happiest results for Venezuela are anticipated from\r\nan administration commenced under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential Election in PERU took place on the 20th of December.\r\nThe prominent candidates were Generals Echinique and San Ramon, and at\r\nthe last accounts it was believed the former was elected.\r\n\r\nBOLIVIA is entirely tranquil, the health of Gen. Belzu having been\r\ncompletely restored since his attempted assassination, and the\r\nconspirators against him, Ballivian and Linares, having fled from the\r\ncountry. The partisans of Ballivian were totally routed in the southern\r\nprovinces, where they attempted to make a stand, and their leader fled\r\nin disguise to Copiape, in Chili. Linares escaped into the Argentine\r\nRepublic, and a requisition for his delivery was about to be issued.\r\n\r\nIn CHILI, the extra session of Congress convened on the 16th of\r\nDecember. In his message calling the session, the President recommended\r\nto legislative attention, the subjects of reform in the customs and the\r\ncoinage system, appropriations for the current year, the regulation of\r\nthe standing army, and a revision of the taxes.\r\n\r\nEarly in December a destructive fire broke out in Valparaiso, which was\r\nfinally quelled through the labors of the sailors from the English and\r\nFrench vessels of war lying in the harbor, after destroying $250,000\r\nworth of property. On the 5th of the month, the volcano of Portillo,\r\nnear Santiago, which had been quiet since 1845, suddenly broke out into\r\nviolent eruption. The following day a very severe shock of an earthquake\r\nwas felt, lasting twenty seconds, but fortunately doing little damage.\r\nSince then, however, a more violent earthquake has entirely destroyed\r\nthe city of Conception, in the southern part of Chili.\r\n\r\nHon. Bailey Peyton, the American Minister, left Valparaiso on the 27th\r\nof December, in the U.S. Ship _Vincennes_, on a visit to Talcuhuana, the\r\nprovince of Conception and the island of Juan Fernandez. Henri Herz, the\r\ndistinguished pianist, has been giving concerts in Santiago.\r\n\r\nAt the latest dates from BRAZIL, nothing of political importance had\r\ntranspired. Accounts from Buenos Ayres to Dec. 12th, state that there\r\nwas a prospect of an amicable settlement of the difficulties between\r\nthat country and Brazil. There had been a conflict between the forces of\r\nParaguay and those of Buenos Ayres, relative to the occupancy of some\r\nneutral lands, by the forces of the latter. The finances of the State\r\nwere said to be in an encouraging condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFRICA.\r\n\r\nThe Monitor, a paper published at Cape Town, South Africa, gives an\r\naccount of a dreadful massacre committed by the noted Namagua chief,\r\nYonker Afrikaner, on the neophytes of the German Missionary station at\r\nNew-Barmen, in Damaraland, between South Africa and the Kingdom of\r\nLoango.\r\n\r\nA curious piece of history has made its way to us from the island of\r\nMadagascar. Rainharo, the Prime Minister of the reigning Queen of the\r\nisland, determined, in June last, to exterminate all the Christians in\r\nthe province of Imirena. Accordingly, when they were all assembled one\r\nevening at their religious exercises, the various communities were\r\nsuddenly arrested, to the number of eight thousand, and condemned to\r\ndeath. Eighteen of them had already been executed, when the rest\r\nescaped, and surrounding the palace of the young Prince, the heir to the\r\nthrone of Madagascar, implored his protection. The Queen sent orders\r\nthrough the Prime Minister that they should be given up. The Prince\r\nrefused, and in the dispute which followed, drew his sword and aimed a\r\nblow at the Minister's head, cutting off one of his ears. When the Queen\r\nheard of this, fearing a revolt in the province of Imirena, to sustain\r\nthe Prince, she suffered the Christians to return to their homes and\r\nworship as usual. They have since been visited by the Prince, who\r\ndeclares his intention to protect them.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of LIBERIA was in a flourishing condition at the\r\ncommencement of the year. Several explorations of the interior have been\r\nmade, to the distance of two or three hundred miles from the coast. The\r\nparties brought back enthusiastic accounts of the richness and beauty of\r\nthe country and the salubrity of the climate. President Roberts had sent\r\nhis message to the Liberian Congress, giving a very favorable account of\r\nthe condition and prospects of the country. The agricultural operations\r\nat Bassa Cove and Bexley have produced very satisfactory results. The\r\nslave trade is said to be almost destroyed in the neighborhood of\r\nGallinas and Ambrize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent Deaths.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REV. WALTER COLTON was born in Rutland, Vermont, about the year\r\n1797. When sixteen years of age he determined to acquire a liberal\r\neducation, and commenced with industrious energy his preparatory\r\nstudies. In 1818 he entered Yale College, where he received the\r\nBerkleyan Prize in Latin and Greek, and delivered the valedictory poem,\r\nwhen he graduated, in 1822. He soon afterwards entered the Theological\r\nSeminary at Andover, where he remained three years, giving much of his\r\ntune to literature, and writing, besides various moral and critical\r\ndissertations, a _Sacred Drama_, which was acted by the students at one\r\nof their rhetorical exhibitions, and an elaborate poem pronounced when\r\nhis class received their diplomas. On being ordained an evangelist,\r\naccording to the usage of the Congregational Church, he became Professor\r\nof Moral Philosophy and Belles-Lettres in the Scientific and Military\r\nAcademy at Middletown, then under the presidency of Captain Alden\r\nPartridge. Besides attending to the more immediate duties of his\r\nposition, he wrote while here a prize _Essay on Duelling_; a _Discussion\r\nof the Genius of Coleridge_; _The Moral Power of the Poet, Painter, and\r\nSculptor, contrasted_, and many contributions in verse and prose to the\r\npublic journals, under the signature of \"Bertram.\" In 1828 he resigned\r\nhis professorship, and settled in Washington, as editor of the _American\r\nSpectator_, a weekly gazette which he conducted with industry, and such\r\ntact and temper, that he preserved the most intimate relations with the\r\nleaders of the political party to which it was most decidedly opposed.\r\nHe was especially a favorite with President Jackson, who was accustomed\r\nto send for him two or three times in a week to sit with him in his\r\nprivate chamber, and when Mr. Colton's health declined, so that a sea\r\nvoyage was recommended by his physicians, the President offered him\r\nwithout solicitation a consulship or a chaplaincy in the Navy. The\r\nlatter was accepted, and from 1830 till the end of his life, he\r\ncontinued as a chaplain in the naval service.\r\n\r\nHis first appointment was to the West India squadron, where his\r\nreputation was increased by several incidents illustrative of his\r\npersonal character. On one occasion a murderous affray had taken place\r\nbetween a boat's crew of American sailors and a party of Spaniards\r\nbelonging to Pensacola, in which several sailors were killed. Mr. Colton\r\ndrew up the official report of the outrage, in which he handled the\r\npolice with just severity. The mayor, himself a Spaniard, and a man of\r\ndesperate character, was greatly enraged, and swore he would take ample\r\nvengeance. He watched his opportunity, and attempted to rush on the\r\nchaplain with his long knife before he could protect himself. But the\r\nlatter, drawing his pistols at the instant, levelled one of them at his\r\nbreast, and told the mayor if he stirred his hand except to return his\r\nknife to its belt, he would put a ball through his heart. The Spaniard\r\nhesitated for a few minutes, and reluctantly complied.\r\n\r\nReturning from the West Indies Mr. Colton was appointed to the\r\nConstellation frigate, and sailed for the Mediterranean, and in the\r\nthree years during which he was connected with this station, he\r\ntravelled through Spain, Italy, Greece, and Asia Minor; visited\r\nConstantinople, and made his way to Paris and London. The results of his\r\nobservations he partially gave to the public in volumes entitled _Ship\r\nand Shore_, and _A Visit to Constantinople and Athens_. Soon after the\r\npublication of these works, he was appointed Historiographer to the\r\nSouth Sea Surveying and Exploring Expedition; but the ultimate reduction\r\nof the force designed for the Pacific squadron, and the resignation of\r\nhis associates, induced him to forego the advantages of this office, for\r\nwhich he had made very careful preparations in ethnographical studies.\r\n\r\nHe was now stationed at Philadelphia, where he was chaplain successively\r\nof the Navy Yard and of the Naval Asylum. In this city we became\r\nacquainted with him, and for several years enjoyed his frequent society\r\nand intimate friendship, so that few have had more ample opportunities\r\nof judging of his character. In 1841 and 1842, with the consent of the\r\nGovernment, he added to his official duties the editorship of the\r\nPhiladelphia _North American_, and in these and the following years he\r\nwrote much upon religious and literary subjects for other journals. We\r\nbelieve it was in 1844 that he delivered before the literary societies\r\nof the University of Vermont, a poem entitled _The Sailor_, which has\r\nnot yet been published. In the summer of 1846 he was married, and we\r\nwere selected by him for that occasion to fill the office commonly\r\nfalling to the nearest friend. A few months afterward he was ordered to\r\nthe Congress, the flag-ship of the Pacific squadron, in which he arrived\r\noff the western coast of America soon after the commencement of the late\r\nwar with Mexico. The incidents of the voyage round Cape Horn are\r\ndetailed with more than his usual felicity in his book, _Deck and Port_,\r\npublished last summer in this city by Barnes & Co.\r\n\r\nSoon after the arrival of the squadron at Monterey, he was appointed\r\nalcalde, or chief magistrate of that city, an office of difficult duties\r\nand large responsibilities, demanding the most untiring industry, zeal,\r\nand fortitude. These were discharged with eminent faithfulness and\r\nability, so that he won as much the regard of the conquered inhabitants\r\nof the country, as the respect of his more immediate associates. In\r\naddition to the ordinary duties of his place, Mr. Colton established the\r\nfirst newspaper printed in California, _The Californian_, now published\r\nin San Francisco, under the title of the \"Alta California;\" he built the\r\nfirst _school-house_ in California; and also a large hall for public\r\nmeetings--said to be the finest building in the state, which the\r\ncitizens called \"Colton Hall,\" in honor of his public spirit and\r\nenterprise. It was during his administration of affairs at Monterey that\r\nthe discovery of gold in the Sacramento Valley was first made; and,\r\nconsidering the vast importance which this discovery has since assumed,\r\nit may not be uninteresting to state that the honor of first making it\r\npublicly known in the Atlantic States, whether by accident or otherwise,\r\nbelongs properly to him. It was first announced in a letter bearing his\r\ninitials, which appeared in the Philadelphia _North American_, and the\r\nnext day in a letter also written by him, in the New-York _Journal of\r\nCommerce_.\r\n\r\nMr. Colton returned to his home early last summer, with anticipations of\r\nyears of undisturbed happiness. With a family deeply attached to him, a\r\nlarge circle of friends, good reputation, and a fortune equal to his\r\ndesires, he applied himself leisurely to the preparation of his MS.\r\njournals for the press, and the revision of his earlier publications.\r\nHe had published, besides _Deck and Port_, already mentioned, _Three\r\nYears in California_, and had nearly ready for the printer a much\r\nenlarged and improved edition of _Ship and Shore_, which was to be\r\nfollowed by _A Visit to Constantinople, Athens, and the AEgean_, a\r\ncollection of his _Poems_, and a volume of _Miscellanies of Literature\r\nand Religion_. His health however began to decline, and a cold, induced\r\nby exposure during a late visit to Washington, ended in granular dropsy,\r\nwhich his physician soon discovered to be incurable. Being in\r\nPhiladelphia on the 22d of January, we left our hotel to pay him an\r\nearly visit, and found the death signs upon his door; he had died at two\r\no'clock that morning, surrounded by his relations, and in the presence\r\nof his friends the Rev. Albert Barnes and the Rev. Dr. Herman\r\nHooker--died very calmly, without mortal enemies and at peace with God.\r\n\r\nMr. Colton was of an eminently genial nature, fond of society, and with\r\nsuch qualities as made him always a welcome associate. His extensive and\r\nvarious travel had left upon his memory a thousand delightful pictures,\r\nwhich were reflected in his conversation so distinctly and with such\r\nskilful preparation of the mind, that his companions lived over his life\r\nwith him as often as he chose to summon its scenes before them. We\r\nbelieve him to have been very sincere in all the professions of honor\r\nand religion, and fully deserving of the respectful regrets with which\r\nhe will be remembered during the lives of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUSTE D'AVEZAC, descended from an illustrious French family, was born\r\nin the island of St. Domingo, about the year 1787. He was educated at\r\nthe celebrated college of La Fleche, in France; emigrated to the United\r\nStates; studied medicine at Edenton, North Carolina; and on the\r\nacquisition of Louisiana removed to New Orleans. Here his sister was\r\nmarried to Chancellor Livingston, and he himself became a successful\r\nlawyer. When General Jackson arrived in New Orleans, d'Avezac became one\r\nof his aid-de-camps, and he served with him to the end of the war, and\r\nremained all his life among his most devoted friends. When General\r\nJackson became President he appointed Major d'Avezac _Charge d'Affaires\r\nto Naples_, and afterwards to the Netherlands, whence he was recalled by\r\nMr. Van Buren, but under circumstances which did not prevent his hearty\r\nsupport of the President's administration. He then took up his residence\r\nin New-York, and in 1841 and 1843 was elected from this city to the\r\nLegislature. In 1845, he was appointed _Charge d'Affaires_ to the Hague,\r\nand he remained there until superseded last year by Mr. Folsom, when he\r\nagain returned to New-York, where he died on the 16th ultimo. He was an\r\neminently agreeable man in society, and wrote in French and English with\r\nease and vivacity, upon literature, art, politics, and history.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Hague, a _cortege_ of upwards of three thousand persons have just\r\naccompanied to the grave, at the premature age of forty-two, M. ASSER, a\r\njudge of high reputation in that city, and author of various works on\r\ncomparative legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrance has lost one of her geographical celebrities, M. PIERRE LAPIE,\r\nfrom whose hand have issued a multitude of valuable maps.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HEINRICH FREDERICK LINK, Professor of Botany in the University of\r\nBerlin, and Director of the Royal Botanic Garden of that city, died on\r\nthe first of January, in the eighty-second year of his age. His literary\r\ncareer extends back for more than half a century, his first botanical\r\nessay, consisting of some observations on the plants of the Botanic\r\nGarden at Rostock, having been published in 1795. He was contemporary\r\nwith Linnaeus, having been eighteen years old when the great author of\r\nthe \"Systema Naturae\" died, and, from his botanical tastes, was probably\r\nacquainted with that naturalist's writings long before his decease.\r\n\r\nHe graduated at Gottingen in 1789, having read on that occasion an\r\ninaugural thesis on the Flora of Gottingen, referring more particularly\r\nto those found in calcareous districts. Shortly afterwards he was\r\nappointed Professor of Botany at Rostock; subsequently he held the same\r\nchair at Breslau; but the latter and larger portion of his scientific\r\nlife was spent at Berlin. He practised at Berlin as a physician among an\r\nextensive circle of friends, who had a high opinion of his medical\r\nskill. Although the name of Link fills a large space in the literature\r\nof botany, his mind was not of the highest order, and his contributions\r\nto science are not likely to make a very permanent impression. Still, he\r\nwas an energetic, active man, with an observant mind, a retentive\r\nmemory, and with considerable power of systematic arrangement. Hence his\r\nworks, like those of Linnaeus, have been among the most valuable of the\r\ncontributions to the botany of the century in which he lived. Of these,\r\nhis \"Elementa Philosophiae Botanicae\" may be quoted as the most useful.\r\nThis work, which was published in 1824, has served as the basis of most\r\nof our manuals and introductions to botany since that period. He devoted\r\nconsiderable time and attention to the description of new species of\r\nplants, most of which he published in a continuation of Willdenow's\r\n\"Species Plantarum.\" With Count Hoffmansegg, he commenced a Flora of\r\nPortugal, and he also published a memoir on the plants of Greece. He\r\ncontributed several valuable papers on physiological botany to the\r\nTransactions of the Natural History Society of Berlin; but he has done\r\nmore service for vegetable physiology in his annual reports than in any\r\nother of his writings. They comprise a summary of all that had been\r\npublished in botany during the year, accompanied with many valuable\r\nremarks and sound criticisms of his own. In these reports he had to\r\ndefend himself and others from the heavy artillery directed against them\r\nby Schleiden, who, whilst claiming for himself a large margin for\r\nliberty of opinion, is most unscrupulous and pertinaciously offensive\r\ntowards those who differ from him. In these literary contests, however,\r\nLink showed that the experience of above fifty years had not been lost\r\nupon him, and he was not unfrequently more than a match for the vigor\r\nand logic of his youthful and more precipitate adversary. According to\r\ncustom, a funeral oration was pronounced over his grave; but\r\nunfortunately the clergyman selected being a strictly orthodox person,\r\nand not being able to approve of the spirit of the whole of the writings\r\nof the deceased, censured them, it is said, in most unbecoming language,\r\nto the indignation of the numerous friends present.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Italian poet LUIGI CARRER, died at Venice on the twenty-third of\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DON JOSE DE SAN MARTIN, formerly the \"Protector of Peru,\" and\r\none of the most deservedly eminent of the public men of the Spanish\r\nAmerican States, died in August, 1850, at Bologna, in the seventy-second\r\nyear of his age. His death has but recently been announced, and we\r\nreceive the information now, not from Europe or from South America, but\r\nby way of the Sandwich Islands. The Honolulu _Polynesian_ of December\r\nfourteenth, translating from the _Panameno_, gives us the following\r\nparticulars of his life. General San Martin was a native of one of the\r\nProvinces of Buenos Ayres, but previous to the war of independence,\r\npassed over to Spain, where he entered into the army, and distinguished\r\nhimself at the battle of Baylen. In the Spanish army, he rose to the\r\nrank of Lieutenant Colonel. After his native country, Buenos Ayres, had\r\ndeclared itself independent of the mother country, he returned from\r\nSpain, and fought with great bravery, against Artigas, and in other\r\nmilitary contests. He thereby gained so much reputation with his\r\ncountrymen, that when an expedition to liberate Chile was determined\r\nupon, he was the chief chosen to organize and command it. He fulfilled\r\nthat trust, in an admirable manner, at Mendoza--carried his small army\r\nsuccessfully across the Andes, through an able piece of strategy,\r\nconfided to a brave young Chilian, Don Manuel Rodriguez, at a point\r\nwhere the Spanish forces did not expect the invading army, and signally\r\ndefeated them, on the plains of _Chacabuco_, near the Capital of Chile.\r\nThe defeated Spaniards had to retire and concentrate themselves in the\r\nSouth. San Martin occupied the whole country and shut them up in\r\n_Talcachuano_. Expecting that the Spaniards would be soon reinforced\r\nfrom Peru, San Martin, with the aid of several foreign officers, French\r\nand English, recruited his forces in Chile, and raised his army to about\r\n9000 men. A strong reinforcement having arrived from Peru, at\r\nTalcahuano, under the command of General Ossioro, the Spaniards regained\r\npossession of the Province of Concepcion, took the offensive, and\r\nadvanced towards the Capital. San Martin, with forces numerically\r\nsuperior, advanced to drive them back. The two armies met at _\"Cancha\r\nRayada,\"_ where, on San Martin's birth day, in 1819, the Spaniards\r\nattacked his army at night, signally defeated and dispersed them. The\r\nonly division that retired unbroken, was that commanded by General Don\r\nGregorio de las Heras, and the army of the Andes left on the field its\r\nwhole artillery, excepting only one piece which was saved by the\r\npersonal exertions and cool intrepidity of Captain Miller, of that army,\r\nnow H. B. M. Consul General for these Islands. After that unexpected\r\ndefeat, the greatest consternation prevailed in the Capital of Chile,\r\nthe cause of the Republic was considered desperate, but the Supreme\r\nDirector, General Don Bernardo Ohiggins, made immense exertions to\r\nreunite the scattered army and to strengthen it, by new levies; the\r\npatriotism of the Chilians roused itself with an energy equal to the\r\nemergency; resident foreign merchants, wishing well to the country and\r\nalarmed by a report that it was the intention of the Spanish Commander\r\nin Chief to shoot them all and confiscate their property (it being then\r\ncontrary to the laws of Spain that foreigners should reside in or trade\r\nwith her Colonies without special license), supplied money, arms and\r\naccoutrements. An army was thus reformed with extraordinary expedition;\r\nits confidence was restored by a troop of cavalry sent to reconnoitre,\r\nheaded by Major Vial, a brave French officer, who gallantly charged and\r\nrouted a superior force of the enemy, and, under the command of General\r\nSan Martin, on the 5th of April, 1850, on the plain of _Maypu_, it\r\ndefeated the Spanish army so completely, that only a few of the\r\nfugitives reached Talcahuano.\r\n\r\nBut experience having shown that the independence of Chile could never\r\nbe considered secure so long as the Spaniards retained their hold on\r\nPeru, it was resolved to make an attempt to liberate that Vice-Royalty.\r\nColonel Miller, whose promotion after the affair of _Cancha Rayadu_ had\r\nbeen rapid, was sent with a small but active force to land at _Arica_\r\nand operate in the Southern Provinces, where by astute strategy and\r\nseveral brilliant successes he confirmed his high reputation. San Martin\r\nsoon after followed with the main army, escorted by the Chilian squadron\r\nunder command of Lord Cochran; in running down the coast, he took in\r\nColonel Miller with his troops, and knowing the powerful diversion that\r\nthe latter had made in the South, he proceeded northward to Pisco, where\r\na force was landed under the command of Colonel Charles and Colonel\r\nMiller, that made itself master of the place, after a bloody combat, in\r\nwhich the former gallantly fell while cheering on his troops, and the\r\nlatter received several musket balls, one of which passed through his\r\nliver.\r\n\r\nAccording to the plan of General San Martin, the force landed to the\r\nSouth of Lima, advanced into the interior to the silver mines of Pasco\r\nunder the command of General Arenales, where it defeated the Spanish\r\nforces under General Oreilly, while San Martin himself, with the main\r\nbody, effected his landing near Huacho to the North of Lima. By this\r\nplan, ably conceived and no less ably executed, the Spaniards were\r\nreduced to the Capital and Callao, which port at the same time was\r\nstrictly blockaded by Lord Cochran's squadron. The fall of both Lima and\r\nCallao was only a question of time; it was retarded for some months\r\nowing to the great sickness that weakened San Martin's ranks; but these\r\nwere filled up by desertions from the enemy; the whole regiment of\r\n_Numancia_ passed over to the Patriot side, and at last San Martin\r\nentered the Capital at the head of his troops, amidst the acclamations\r\nof the inhabitants. He was soon after declared Protector of Peru, and\r\nGeneral-in-Chief of the Army. Having now a Peruvian character, and\r\nhaving come to liberate--not to conquer the country, he considered it\r\nright to create a Peruvian Army. As a _nucleus_ for its formation, the\r\n_Peruvian Legion_ (intended to consist of several Batallions), was\r\nraised, and placed under the command of Colonel Miller. But Lima and its\r\nluxuries proved the _Capua_ of San Martin's army--national jealousies\r\narose between the Buenos Ayrean and the Chilian chiefs--San Martin's\r\nconfidence in foreign officers and his endeavors to create a national\r\narmy in Peru gave great umbrage to both; a secret political Lodge was\r\nformed among the leading chiefs of corps, and he was openly charged with\r\nlatent designs to make himself the King or Perpetual Dictator of Peru.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish army, which had evacuated the Capital unbroken, profiting by\r\nthese dissensions and the delay of the Patriot army in the Capital, had\r\nlargely recruited itself in the valley of Jauja; they were every day\r\ngaining more strength, while the Patriot army was becoming daily weaker\r\nboth physically and morally; under these circumstances General San\r\nMartin sought an interview with _Bolivar_, at Guayaquil, and shortly\r\nafter his return to Lima, in 1822, he resigned his high post of\r\nProtector and General-in-chief, and embarked for Europe. On his arrival\r\nin Europe, after a short visit to the East of Fife, San Martin passed\r\nhis time chiefly in Brussels and Paris, so much respected by all who\r\nknew him, and so esteemed for his probity, that _Sor Aguado_, the rich\r\nSpanish Banker, on his death-bed, named San Martin his Executor.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that he retired from Peru, disgusted with the false\r\ncharges that were brought against him, and after having obtained a\r\npromise from his great rival, Bolivar, that he would finish the war,\r\nwhich it would have been much for San Martin's own glory to have\r\nconcluded himself. If so, he had the _magnanimity_ to prefer the good of\r\nPeru to his own glory, a virtue never found except amongst men of great\r\nnobleness of soul. San Martin may have even thought that under the\r\ncircumstances, his great rival was fitter to conclude the war than he\r\nwas himself; and if he did so, the result proved at once his modesty and\r\nthe soundness of his judgment, for when the Peruvian Government had\r\nfairly intrusted their destinies to Bolivar, in rapid succession, he\r\nfought the bloody battles of Junin and Ayacucho, the result of which was\r\nthe final and total liberation of Peru.\r\n\r\nNor was Bolivar less just to foreign officers of merit than San Martin.\r\nAmongst his Generals and Aid-de-camps ranked General Brawn, General\r\nOleary, Colonel Wilson, and many others; and Colonel Miller (who had\r\nbeen raised to the rank of General), as the reward of his gallant\r\nconduct in the last hard-fought fields of Junin and Ayacucho, received\r\nthe further honor of being declared a _Marescal de Agacucho_. To other\r\nofficers of Peru, of Chile and of Buenos Ayres, Bolivar was equally\r\njust, thus showing that he was superior to any petty jealousy of those\r\nchiefs with whose aid San Martin, his illustrious predecessor, had made\r\nthose great achievements which a weaker mind might have looked upon with\r\nenvy as, in some respects, overwhelming his own.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREDERICK BASTIAT, the political economist, whose health had been very\r\nfeeble for nearly a year, and of whose death last summer in Italy a\r\nreport was copied into the _International_, died in Rome on the 24th of\r\nDecember. He was born at Bayonne in 1801, and after completing his\r\neducation, he retired to a quiet village in the department of Landes, to\r\npursue his favorite studies of trade and society. He was successively\r\ncalled to various offices of the department, and to the present National\r\nAssembly he was chosen by a vote of 56,000, being the second in the list\r\nof seven representing the Landes. His first book, we believe, was\r\n_Cobden et la Ligue_, published in 1844, from which period he was an\r\nindustrious writer. Without being a discoverer of new truths, he\r\npossessed in an eminent degree the faculty of expanding, with clearness\r\nand vigor, the grounds and the effects of complex natural laws already\r\ndeveloped by the technical processes of philosophy. His writings have\r\nbeen exceedingly popular. The whole or nearly the whole, of the tracts\r\nwritten by him under the generic title of 'Sophismes Economiques,'\r\noriginally appeared in the _Journal des Economistes_--a periodical of\r\nwhich for the last six years he had been a principal supporter. The\r\ndisease of which he died was a very painful and peculiar affection of\r\nthe throat. He had suffered from it more or less, for some years; and\r\nthe hard work of the last session of the Assembly brought the disorder\r\nto a crisis which the strength of the patient did not enable him to\r\novercome. He may be regarded as the virtual leader of the Free Trade\r\nparty in France. He aided with all his energies the Association\r\nFrancaise pour la Liberte des Echanges, and he did his utmost to spread\r\namong his countrymen that new philosophy of trade. His last and most\r\nimportant work, _Les Harmonies Economiques_, we lately noticed in these\r\npages. His _Sophismes Economiques_ were translated a few years ago by a\r\ndaughter of Langdon Cheves, of South Carolina, and published in this\r\ncity by Mr. Putnam. The extent to which M. Bastiat was indebted to our\r\ncountryman, Henry C. Carey, may be inferred from a note in the February\r\nnumber of the _International_, page 402.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN W. CROWNINSHIELD, died in Boston, on Monday the 3d of February.\r\nHe had left his carriage and entered a store, when he suddenly fell and\r\nexpired, having previously suffered from a disease of the heart, which\r\nis supposed to have been the cause of his death, although he was about\r\n77 years of age. He had been a resident of Boston nearly twenty years,\r\nduring the greater part of which period he had been retired from public\r\nlife. He had previously resided in Salem, where the Crowninshields were\r\nlong distinguished for wealth and commercial enterprise. He was many\r\nyears a prominent leader of the old democratic republican party. In\r\nDecember, 1814, he received, from President Madison, the appointment of\r\nSecretary of the Navy, which office he held (being continued by\r\nPresident Monroe) until he resigned, in November, 1818, when he was\r\nsucceeded by Smith Thompson, afterwards judge of the Supreme Court. In\r\n1823 he was chosen a member of Congress from Essex South District, and\r\nwas continued by his constituents in that station until 1831--eight\r\nyears. He was in Congress when John Quincy Adams was elected President\r\nof the United States, by that body; he participated in that election by\r\ngiving his vote for Mr. A., and was a zealous supporter of his\r\nadministration, acting subsequently with the whig party. He was\r\nrepeatedly, at different periods of his life, a member of the state\r\nlegislature, and although not distinguished for eminent talents, in all\r\nthe stations which he filled he enjoyed, in a high degree, the public\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR ANSTEY, lately connected with St. Mary's College, at\r\nWilmington, died in the early part of February. He was dismissed from\r\nhis station on account of intemperate habits, but continued his\r\ndissipation until reduced to the utmost destitution, wandering about\r\nhomeless and friendless. He was discovered at length in an almost frozen\r\nstate, in an old hovel, with a bottle of whiskey by his side, and soon\r\ndied from the effects of his suffering. Professor Anstey was a young man\r\nof fine classical attainments, and was the author of a work published a\r\nyear or two since in Philadelphia, entitled, \"Elements of Literature, or\r\nan introduction to the Study of Rhetoric and Belle Lettres.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDONALD MCKENZIE, born in Scotland, June 15, 1783, died on the 20th of\r\nJanuary, at Mayville, in New-York. At the age of seventeen he came over\r\nto Canada and joined the North West Company, and continued eight years\r\nwith them. In 1809 he became one of the partners with the late John\r\nJacob Astor, in establishing the fur trade west of the Rocky Mountains,\r\nand with Mr. Hunt, of St. Louis, made the overland route to the mouth of\r\nthe Columbia River, a feat then rarely attempted, and full of perils,\r\nand remained at Astoria until it was surrendered by McDougal to the\r\nBritish. He converted every thing he could into available funds, which\r\nhe carried safely through the wilderness to Mr. Astor. Washington\r\nIrving, in \"Astoria,\" narrates a few of Mr. McKenzie's adventures on the\r\nfrontiers, although the friends of McKenzie claim that injustice has\r\nbeen done him by Mr. Irving, relative to the betrayal of Astoria. They\r\ncontend that to him alone was Mr. Astor indebted for all that was saved.\r\nAfter the restoration of peace, McKenzie exerted himself to secure for\r\nthe United States the exclusive trade of Oregon, but after a long\r\nnegotiation with Mr. Astor, and through him with Messrs. Madison,\r\nGallatin, and other leading individuals in and out of office, the matter\r\nwas abandoned, and McKenzie, in March, 1821, joined the Hudson Bay\r\nCompany, and was immediately appointed one of the Council, and Chief\r\nFactor. In August, 1825, he was married to Adelegonde Humburt (who\r\nsurvives him), and was shortly after appointed Governor. At this time he\r\nresided at Fort Garry, Red River settlement, where he continued to\r\nreside until 1832, in active and prosperous business, in which he\r\namassed a large fortune. In August of the following year he went to\r\nreside in Mayville, where he spent the rest of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORACE EVERETT, LL.D., formerly a distinguished representative in\r\nCongress from Vermont, died at Windsor in that State on the 30th of\r\nJanuary, in the seventy-second year of his age. Elected to Congress by\r\nthe opponents of General Jackson, he entered the House of\r\nRepresentatives in 1829, and was continued by his constituents,\r\ninhabiting one of the strongest and most enlightened whig districts in\r\nthe Union, for fourteen consecutive years--his last term expiring in\r\nMarch, 1843. During his career in Congress, he was one of the most\r\nprominent whigs of the House, occupying the front rank, as one of the\r\nmost able of parliamentary debaters, distinguished also as much his good\r\nsense and acquirements, as for his eloquence. Among his best speeches,\r\nwere several on the Indian Bill, so called, growing out of the\r\ndifficulties between Georgia and the Cherokees.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London _Morning Chronicle_ has a brief notice of JAMES HARFIELD, who\r\nwas connected with that journal more than twenty years. His reading, in\r\nevery department of literature, was prodigious, and his memory almost a\r\nphenomenon. On all matters connected with Parliamentary history,\r\nprecedent, and etiquette in particular, Mr. Harfield was an encyclopaedia\r\nof information, while the stores of his learning, in every department,\r\nwere always freely at the command of his friends and colleagues. In\r\nearly life, Mr. Harfield was a _protege_ of, and afterwards acted as\r\nsecretary to, Jeremy Bentham, who acknowledged his sense of his young\r\nfriend's services by bequeathing to him a magnificent library.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM WILSON, a painter of considerable reputation, died in\r\nCharleston, S. C, on the 28th of January. The Charleston _Evening News_\r\nsays:--\"He was a native of Yorkshire, England, but for the last twenty\r\nyears has resided in this country, and during the last eleven, in\r\nGeorgia and South Carolina. In all the relations of life, as husband,\r\nfather, son, and brother, he was irreproachable, while his gentle and\r\nwinning manners conciliated general esteem and regard. At his death Mr.\r\nWilson had attained a distinguished reputation as a portrait painter, in\r\nwhich department he first attracted attention in 1836, by the exhibition\r\nof a portrait of an intimate friend at the first exhibition of the\r\n\"American Art-Union,\" at the Apollo Gallery. In 1837 he exhibited\r\nseveral heads of the Academy of Design, which attracted much attention.\r\nIn 1844 he exhibited a head of a brother artist, which was more\r\ngenerally admired than any similar production for years. In 1846 Mr. W.\r\nreceived a commission from the State of Georgia to execute two\r\nportraits--one of William H. Crawford, former Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nand the other of Gen. Jackson. After a tedious and troublesome journey\r\nto the North, in search of Jarvis's portrait of Crawford, which could\r\nnot be traced, he returned to Charleston, and while copying from\r\nVanderlyn's portrait of Gen. Jackson in the City Hall, he was presented\r\nby Charles Fraser, Esq., with a proof engraving of Jarvis's Crawford,\r\nfrom which, on his return to Augusta, he produced a most striking\r\nportrait of Georgia's greatest statesman. These pictures of Jackson and\r\nCrawford, which adorn the State House at Milledgeville, will be lasting\r\nmemorials of his excellence as an artist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES WALLACE, D.D., the distinguished Mathematician, several years\r\nProfessor of Mathematics in Columbia College, New-York, died in\r\nLexington District, South Carolina, on the 15th of January. After\r\ncompleting his course of Theology, he was ordained a clergyman of the\r\nRoman Catholic Church, and was then appointed to the chair of\r\nMathematics in Georgetown College, D.C. A few years later he removed to\r\nColumbia, S. C., and was appointed Professor of Mathematics in South\r\nCarolina College. While in New-York he published his justly celebrated\r\n\"Treatise on Globes and Practical Astronomy,\" and had prepared materials\r\nfor an entire course of Natural Philosophy and Astronomy, but was\r\ncompelled to relinquish his design on account of ill-health and advanced\r\nage. He was also the author of numerous scientific articles in the\r\nSouthern Quarterly Review. He possessed one of the choicest and most\r\nextensive scientific libraries in the United States, which was almost\r\nentirely destroyed by the great conflagration of 1837: the remnant of\r\nit, with his scientific apparatus, was bequeathed to the Catholic\r\nTheological Seminary of Charleston. He was a resident of South Carolina\r\nduring the last thirty-eight years.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSHUA MILNE, the author of the celebrated treatise on \"Annuities and\r\nAssurances,\" we see by the English papers died recently near London at\r\nthe advanced age of seventy-eight. He is said to have left behind him\r\nthe most complete collection extant on subjects connected with the\r\nstatistics of vitality, of which a portion at least will probably be\r\ngiven to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hungarian General BEM, expired with the half-century. Born at\r\nTarnon, a Pole, he died at Aleppo, a Turk. In early youth he served in\r\nthe Russian army against Napoleon in his disastrous campaign. He was the\r\nfriend, companion, and favorite of the Grand Duke Constantine, until\r\ncertain indignities to himself and cruelties to his countrymen made him\r\nthe implacable foe of Russia. He joined the Polish insurrection of 1831,\r\nand performed prodigies of valor at the battle of Ostrolenka. Like many\r\nothers, he became a fugitive and a wanderer. Unsuccessful patriotism\r\nreduced the companion of royalty to be a pensioner on the charity of the\r\nfriends of Poland in London. 1848 gave Bern once more a career. He went\r\nto Vienna, and when the people were in the ascendant, in October, he\r\nheld a command. But the Viennese could not trust the Pole. Incompetent\r\nmen were placed over him. Vienna fell before the artillery of\r\nWindischgratz and Jellachich in November. Slaughter, terror, violation\r\nreigned. Never will the Viennese forget the red cloaks of the Croats.\r\nThe educated youth of Vienna were shot in clusters. Robert Blum was led\r\nout to perish. The Odeon, although used as an hospital, was laid in\r\nashes, with the wounded in it. Great rewards were offered for the\r\napprehension of the popular leaders and generals still alive. The search\r\nfor Bem was vigilant. He doffed the costume of a hackney coachman,\r\nfilled his vehicle with a Hungarian family of nurses and children,\r\nmounted the box under the eyes of spies and soldiers, laughed at\r\ninspection, and drove off to Hungary. For ten mouths he was victorious\r\nthere over the Austrians. \"Bem beat the Ban.\" Splinters from an old\r\nwound escaping from his leg all the time, and able only to sit on\r\nhorseback.\r\n\r\n\r\nT. S. DAVIES, F.R.S., F.A.S., and a Professor of Mathematics in the\r\nRoyal Military Academy at Woolwich, died on the 6th of January at\r\nShooter's Hill, Kent, in the fifty-seventh year of his age. Mr. Davies\r\nwas a very distinguished mathematician, and the author of several works\r\non mathematics. He possessed, also, extensive and varied acquirements in\r\ndifferent branches of science and literature. Nor was he unmindful of\r\nthe claims of the more humble aspirant to mathematical honors; his\r\nencouragement and advice were liberally bestowed, as many deserving\r\nyoung men could testify.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY CHRISTIAN SCHUMACHER, the celebrated Danish Astronomer, died at\r\nAltona on the 28th of December, aged about seventy years. He commenced\r\nhis professional career at the age of twenty-five, as professor of\r\nastronomy in the University of Copenhagen. In 1822, his royal master,\r\nFrederic VI., caused to be built, expressly that Schumacher might be\r\nplaced at the head of it, the Observatory of Altona. From 1820 to 1829\r\nhe published his \"_Auxiliary Tables of Astronomy_\", in ten volumes,\r\n_quarto_. His _Astronomical Annals_, continued from 1830 to the date of\r\nhis death, have, with his _Tables_, given him a high and wide\r\nreputation. In 1832 the King of Denmark established the reward of a\r\ngolden medal for the discovery of new microscopic comets; and it was\r\nupon his favorite Schumacher exclusively that he devolved the duty of\r\nverifying the title of claimants and assigning the medal. Since 1847\r\nSchumacher has been the correspondent of the Academy of Sciences of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXWELL, the Irish novelist, and author of innumerable humorous sketches\r\nin the periodical literature of the day, expired on the 29th of\r\nDecember, at Musselberge, near Edinburgh. His generally vigorous health\r\nhad of late broken down, and he crept into the retirement of this\r\nsequestered village to die. He had been in early life a captain in the\r\nBritish army, and was of course the delight of the mess-room, and a\r\ngeneral favorite in social circles. He subsequently entered the church,\r\nand was some years prebendary of Balla, a wild Connaught church living,\r\nwithout any congregation or cure of souls attached to it; though it\r\nafforded what he was admirably capable of dealing with, plenty of game.\r\nOf a warm-hearted, kind, and manly temperament, he made friends of all\r\nwho came within the range of his wit or the circle of his acquaintance.\r\nHe was the founder of that school which counts the \"Harry Lorrequers\"\r\nand others among its humble disciples; but the \"Story of my Life,\" and\r\n\"Wild Sports of the West,\" will not be easily surpassed in the peculiar\r\nqualities of that gay and off-hand style of which he was the originator.\r\nAmong his other more successful works are \"Stories of Waterloo,\" \"Hector\r\nO'Halloran,\" and \"Rambling Recollections of a Soldier of Fortune.\"\r\nBesides his novels, he wrote \"Notes and Reflections during a Ramble in\r\nGermany,\" \"Victories of the British Armies,\" and a \"Life of Field\r\nMarshal the Duke of Wellington\".\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER MACDONALD, well known to the public as an antiquary, died\r\nearly in January at Edinburgh. He was one of Mr. Thompson's earliest\r\nassistants in the publication of the \"Acts of the Parliaments of\r\nScotland,\" and other works, undertaken by the Record Commissioners. He\r\nwas long a most active member of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland;\r\nand the library and museum of that body owe much to his industry and\r\nintelligence. He edited several volumes of the Maitland Club, to which\r\nhe contributed \"The Register of Ministers in the year 1567\"--the\r\nearliest extant record of the ecclesiastical appointments of the\r\nReformed Church in Scotland. Mr. Macdonald also largely supplied the\r\nmaterials of Sir Walter Scott's notes and illustrations of the \"Waverley\r\nNovels.\" He held many years the office of Keeper of the Register of\r\nDeeds and Protests in Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScientific Miscellanies\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. WALSH writes from Paris to the _Journal of Commerce_, in the last\r\nmonth, as follows:\r\n\r\nThe _Annuaire_, or Annual for the present year, has been issued by the\r\nBoard of Longitude. M. Arago has appended to it nearly 200 pages on the\r\nCalendar in which he treats of all the divisions of time among the\r\nancients and the moderns. This celebrated astronomer does not belie, in\r\nthis notice, his reputation for handling scientific subjects so as to\r\nmake them clear to common apprehension. He announces, in his second\r\npage, that he has completed and will soon publish a _Treatise of Popular\r\nAstronomy_; a desideratum for France. Sir John Herschel has supplied it\r\nfor English readers, in his Outlines. The present history and\r\nexplanations of the Calendar may be recommended, as material, to your\r\nProfessor Loomis. In the section concerning the period at which the\r\nParis clocks were first regulated on the mean or true time, Arago\r\nobserves: \"It will not happen again that an astronomer shall hear for a\r\nhalf hour, the same hour struck by different clocks, as Delambre told me\r\nhe had often experienced. M. Chabrol, the Prefect of the Department of\r\nthe Seine, before he would introduce this useful change, required, as a\r\nguaranty for himself, a report from the Board of Longitude: he was\r\nfearful that the change might provoke the working population to\r\ninsurrection; that they might refuse to accept a mid-day or noon which,\r\nby a contradiction in terms, would not correspond to the middle of the\r\nday; which would divide in two unequal portions the time comprised\r\nbetween the rising and the setting of the sun. But this sinister\r\nanticipation was not realized; the operation passed without being\r\nperceived.\" It is all important, on the railroads, that the clocks at\r\nthe different stations should be so regulated. Arago remarks that among\r\nthe ancients it would have been dangerous to announce the existence of\r\nmore than seven planets, owing to the \"mysterious virtues\" ascribed to\r\nthat number; to complete it the sun was counted among the planets. He\r\ndiscusses the point--which is the first day of the week, and decides for\r\nSunday. He devotes a section to the question--\"Will the period come when\r\nthe days will be equal between themselves, and have the same temperature\r\nthroughout the year?\" He concludes, of course, in the negative. He\r\ndecides, also, that the nineteenth century began only on the 1st of\r\nJanuary, 1801. Particular interest may be attributed to the section on\r\nthe long series of ages which the ancients invested with the title \"The\r\nGreat Year.\" The high names of Plato, Cicero, Seneca, Plutarch, should\r\nnot prevent us from regarding the opinions of antiquity on the relations\r\nof the great year, with the events of every kind observable on the\r\nearth, as among the crudest conceptions that have descended to the\r\nmoderns.\r\n\r\nAt the sitting of the _Academy of Sciences_ on the 24th ult., M.\r\nAUGUSTIN CAUCHY read a memoir on the transversal vibrations of ether,\r\nand of the dispersion of colors. He furnished a simple, and easily\r\nintelligible mathematical theory of the various phenomena of light, and\r\nparticularly, the theory of the dispersion of colors. Lord Brougham read\r\na paper of his _Researches, Experimental and Analytical, on Light_. His\r\nLordship's ambition is to shine in optics, as in every thing else; but\r\nyou will see by a London paragraph that his researches have nearly cost\r\nhim his eyesight. Dr. Aran submitted a Memoir, which seems to be quite\r\nimportant, on local anesthetic medication. \"In the medical point of\r\nview,\" he remarks, \"the number of cases in which local anesthetic\r\napplications may be employed, is truly immense. My experiments and\r\nresearches, during many months, have conducted me to this practical\r\nresult, which is worthy of all attention. Whenever an acute pain exists\r\nin any part of the animal economy, whether the pain constitute the\r\nmalady in itself or be only an integral and principal part of it, the\r\nphysician can relieve the patient of it for a longer or shorter time, by\r\none or various local anesthetic applications. Great service, too, may be\r\nrendered by the precedent use of them in various surgical cases. The\r\nmedication is wonderfully useful in articular acute rheumatism.\"\r\n\r\n\"Local anesthetic properties belong to all the agents in which the\r\ngeneral have been found. They depend on the degree of fixity of the\r\nsubstance. A number of the anesthetics are irritating for the skin;\r\nchloroform in particular. According to Dr. Aran, the best agent for\r\ntopical use is _ether chlorhydique chlore_. This is efficacious in a few\r\nminutes. Monsieur Recamier has submitted to the Academy of Medicine a\r\n_galvanic cataplasm_, by which, when it is applied to the skin, the\r\nbenefit of electricity is fully conveyed, without the least pain. The\r\nreporter exclaims, 'Yes, who would have thought it? Electricity is\r\ntransformed into cataplasm. This mysterious power, which, perhaps, is\r\nlife itself, is reduced to an humble and common part in pharmaceutical\r\nscience.'\r\n\r\n\"At the sitting of the _Academy of Sciences_ on the 30th ult., a very\r\ninteresting memoir (the 4th) was read by M.A. Masson, with the title,\r\nStudies of Electrical Photometry. He thinks that he has ascertained the\r\ncause of electrical light. He ascribes the Aurora Borealis to currents\r\nof great intensity situate in the higher regions of our atmosphere.\" The\r\nReport of Lieut. J.C. Walsh on his soundings, was referred for\r\nexamination to Duperroy, the member most eminent in hydrography.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONSIEUR POUILLET, the great Professor of Physics, has published in\r\nParis a work entitled _General Notions of Natural Philosophy and\r\nMeteorology, for the use of young persons_; and Mr. Boussingault,\r\neminent as a scientific agriculturist, the second edition of his _Rural\r\nEconomy considered in its Relations with Chemistry, Physics, and\r\nMineralogy_. The _Treatise of Mineralogy_ by Dufresnoy, the celebrated\r\nProfessor, who is of the Academy of Sciences, is complete, and at least\r\nequal to any other extant. There are four volumes octavo. The 22d volume\r\nof the memoirs of the Academy was ready in September last; the 23d is in\r\nthe press; the 11th volume of Foreign Communications will appear this\r\nmonth. Twelve vacancies from death of foreign correspondents, are soon\r\nto be filled by election. All merit is ascribed to the work of Dr.\r\nFairet, entitled _Clinical Instructions respecting Mental Maladies_. The\r\nauthor, pupil and successor of Pinel and Esquirol, is the physician of\r\nthe Salpetriere. Along with the able Doctor Voison, he has a noble\r\nLunatic Asylum of his own, not far from the capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR DAVID BREWSTER, it seems, has become a convert to that part of\r\nAnimal Magnetism called Electro Biology, and which consists in willing a\r\nperson to be somebody else. After describing some wonderful experiments,\r\nmade in the presence of several scientific gentlemen, by a Mr. DARLING,\r\nhe says, \"they were all as convinced as I was, that the phenomena which\r\nwe witnessed were real phenomena, and as well established as any other\r\nfacts in physical science. The process by which the operator produces\r\nthem--the mode by which that process acts upon the mind of the\r\npatient--and the reference of the phenomena to some general law in the\r\nconstitution of man--may long remain unknown; but it is not difficult to\r\nsee in the recent discoveries of M. DUBOIS REYMOND and MATTEUCIA, and in\r\nthe laws which regulate the relative intensity of the external and\r\ninternal impressions on the nerves of sensation, some not very\r\nindistinct indications of that remarkable process by which minds of\r\npeculiar sensibility are temporarily placed under the dominion of\r\nphysical influences developed and directed by some living agent.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLadies' Fashions for Early Spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore attention than previously for many seasons appears to have been\r\ngiven this winter to ladies' fashions, and some that have come out are\r\nremarkably tasteful, while generally in fabric and manufacture they\r\nappear to be unusually expensive. We compile this month mainly from the\r\nLondon _World of Fashion_.\r\n\r\n_Bonnets_ are remarkable for a novel form, the front of the rims\r\ncontinuing large and open, the crowns round, low, and small. Of an\r\nelegant style are those made of Orient gray pearl, half satin, half\r\n_velours epingle_, having a very rich effect, and decorated with\r\n_touffes Marquises_, composed of _marabouts_. Then, we see bonnets of\r\ngreen satin, ornamented at the edge, over the front, and upon the crown,\r\nwith a stamped velvet imitating lace, and decorated upon the left side\r\nwith a small _plumet_ in a weeping feather, the ends of which are tied\r\nor knotted with green, of two different shades; this is a very favorite\r\nand _recherche_ style. Also a bonnet of grayish green velvet, ornamented\r\nwith a bunch of feathers composed of the _grebe_ and the ostrich.\r\nDrooping low feathers of every description are in request for decorating\r\nbonnets.\r\n\r\n_Ball Dresses_ of light materials are most in vogue, and are generally\r\nmade of two and three skirts; as white _tulle_, with three skirts,\r\ntrimmed all round with a broad, open-worked satin ribbon; the third\r\nskirt being raised on one side, and attached with a large bouquet of\r\nflowers, whilst the ribbon is twisted, and ascends to the side of the\r\nwaist, where it finishes; the same kind of flowers serves to ornament\r\nthe sleeves and centre of the corsage, which is also trimmed with a deep\r\ndrapery of _tulle_. Feather trimmings are in vogue, disposed as fringes\r\nof _marabout_, and placed at the edges of the double skirts of _tulle_.\r\nAnother pretty style, composed also of white _tulle_, and _a double\r\njupes_, the under one having a border of white _marabout_ fringe\r\nsprinkled with small golden grains falling over them in a perfect\r\nshower; the second _jupe_ having attached to the edge of the hem a\r\nnarrower fringe; the two sides of the upper skirt being open to the\r\nwaist, is ornamented upon each side with an embroidery of gold and white\r\nsilk, caught at regular distances with _noeuds_ of white and gold\r\ngauze ribbon, the floating ends of which are edged with fringe; body _a\r\nla Grecque_.\r\n\r\n_Capotes_ of velvet are considerably lightened in appearance, by a\r\nnovelty consisting of a kind of open stamped velvet, which is placed\r\nover satin; either a pretty contrast in color, or of the same hue;\r\nwhilst those of plain velvet are relieved with trimmings of black lace,\r\nwith _mancinis_ formed of the convolvulus, made in green velvet. The\r\nform of the present style of _capotes_ is very open in front, flat upon\r\nthe top of the head, and shallow and sloping at the back. Some are of\r\ngreen satin, trimmed with ribbons of an open pattern in black and green.\r\nOthers are decorated with rows of fancy ribbon-velvet, the interior\r\nhaving loops of narrow ribbon-velvet of two colors, charmingly blended.\r\n\r\nI. A high dress of green silk, the body opening in front _a la demi\r\ncoeur_; the waist is long and rounded in front; the sleeves, reaching\r\na little below the elbow, are moderately wide, and finished either by a\r\n_ruche_ or rich _guimpe_ trimming; the skirt is plain, long, and full.\r\n_Pardessus manteau_ of claret velvet, fastening to the throat; it is\r\nornamented with a narrow silk trimming: this _manteau_ is lined with\r\nwhite silk, quilted in large squares. Bonnet of green velvet, with\r\nfeathers of the same color placed low at the left side.\r\n\r\nII. _Robe_ of blue _brocade_; the high body opens in the front nearly to\r\nthe waist; the fronts of the skirt are lined with amber satin, and a\r\nfulling of the same is placed on the edge of the fronts, graduating in\r\nwidth towards the top; it is carried round the neck of the dress; the\r\nsleeves are very wide from the elbow, and lined with amber satin; the\r\nedge of the sleeve is left plain, but there is a _ruche_ of satin round\r\nthe middle of the sleeve, just above the elbow. Under dress of jaconet\r\nmuslin, trimmed with lace or embroidery. Cap of _tulle_, with blue\r\ntrimmings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIII. A dress of pink _tulle_, spotted and _brode_ in silver; the _jupe_\r\ncomposed of three skirts, each waved round the lower part; plain\r\nclose-fitting body, made very low, and pointed at the waist; the upper\r\npart decorated with a narrow cape, descending in a point upon the front\r\nof the corsage, and decorated with a splendid bouquet of roses; a second\r\nrow of frilling forms the loose short sleeve; the whole worn over a\r\ndress of pale pink satin; a narrow row of white blonde encircling the\r\nneck. The hair is arranged in a similar form to figure I; the only\r\ndifference being that the _noeud_ of ribbon is replaced by a beautiful\r\ndrooping branch of pink shaded roses and light foliage; a spray of the\r\nthree green leaves being placed upon the centre of the front, just over\r\nthe parting of the hair.\r\n\r\nIV. A dress of green satin; the skirt, long and full, has four rows of\r\nbraid up the front; the body is high, open a little in the front, the\r\nbraid being carried round it; it is plaited from the shoulder to the\r\nwaist; wide sleeves, with broad cuffs turned back; they have three rows\r\nof braid on them. _Mantelot_ of grey cachmere, the sleeves _a la\r\nMaintenon_; the edges are all scalloped and trimmed with braid. Bonnet\r\nof ultra marine velvet; a broad black lace is turned back over the edge;\r\nit has a deep curtain.\r\n\r\n_For a Young Lady's Dress_, _Capote_ formed of rows of narrow pink fancy\r\nribbon. Frock of dark blue cachmere; the skirt trimmed with two rows of\r\nribbon-velvet; the cape formed of narrow folds, open in the front,\r\ncontinued across with bands of velvet. Pantaloons of embroidered\r\ncambric.",
