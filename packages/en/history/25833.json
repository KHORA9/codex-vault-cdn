We know it all too well.\r\n\r\nThis book is not published to tell us that there is an irreconcilable\r\ncontroversy between darkness and light, sin and righteousness, wrong and\r\nright, death and life. In our heart of hearts we know it, and know that we\r\nare participators, actors, in the conflict.\r\n\r\nBut to every one of us comes at times a longing to know more of the great\r\ncontroversy. How did the controversy begin? or was it always here? What\r\nelements enter into its awfully complex aspect? How am I related to it?\r\nWhat is my responsibility? I find myself in this world by no choice of my\r\nown. Does that mean to me evil or good?\r\n\r\nWhat are the great principles involved? How long will the controversy\r\ncontinue? What will be its ending? Will this earth sink, as some\r\nscientists tell us, into the depths of a sunless, frozen, eternal night?\r\nor is there a better future before it, radiant with the light of life,\r\nwarm with the eternal love of God?\r\n\r\nThe question comes closer still: How may the controversy in my own heart,\r\nthe strife between inflowing selfishness and outgoing love, be settled in\r\nthe victory of good, and settled forever? What does the Bible say? What\r\nhas God to teach us upon this question, eternally important to every soul?\r\n\r\nQuestions like these meet us from every side. They rise insistent up from\r\nthe depths of our own heart. They demand definite answer.\r\n\r\nSurely the God who created in us the longing for the better, the desire\r\nfor the truth, will not withhold from us the answer to all needed\r\nknowledge; for “the Lord Jehovah will do nothing, except He reveal His\r\nsecret unto His servants the prophets.”\r\n\r\nIt is the aim of this book, reader, to help the troubled soul to a right\r\nsolution of all these problems. It is written by one who has tasted and\r\nfound that God is good, and who has learned in communion with God and the\r\nstudy of His word that the secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him,\r\nand that He will show them His covenant.\r\n\r\nThat we may better understand the principles of the all-important\r\ncontroversy, in which the life of a universe is involved, the author has\r\nset it before us in great, concrete object-lessons of the last twenty\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nThe book opens with the sad closing scenes of Jerusalem’s history, the\r\ncity of God’s chosen, after her rejection of the Man of Calvary, who came\r\nto save. Thence onward along the great highway of the nations, it points\r\nus to the persecutions of God’s children in the first centuries; the great\r\napostasy which followed in His church; the world-awakening of the\r\nReformation, in which some of the great principles of the controversy are\r\nclearly manifest; the awful lesson of the rejection of right principles by\r\nFrance; the revival and exaltation of the Scriptures, and their\r\nbeneficent, life-saving influence; the religious awakening of the last\r\ndays; the unsealing of the radiant fountain of God’s word, with its\r\nwonderful revelations of light and knowledge to meet the baleful\r\nupspringing of every delusion of darkness.\r\n\r\nThe present impending conflict, with the vital principles involved, in\r\nwhich no one can be neutral, are simply, lucidly, strongly set forth.\r\n\r\nLast of all, we are told of the eternal and glorious victory of good over\r\nevil, right over wrong, light over darkness, joy over sorrow, hope over\r\ndespair, glory over shame, life over death, and everlasting,\r\nlong-suffering love over vindictive hate.\r\n\r\nFormer editions of this book have brought many souls to the True Shepherd;\r\nit is the prayer of the publishers that this edition may be even more\r\nfruitful of eternal good.\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLISHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       [Illustration: Introduction]\r\n\r\nBefore the entrance of sin, Adam enjoyed open communion with his Maker;\r\nbut since man separated himself from God by transgression, the human race\r\nhas been cut off from this high privilege. By the plan of redemption,\r\nhowever, a way has been opened whereby the inhabitants of the earth may\r\nstill have connection with heaven. God has communicated with men by His\r\nSpirit, and divine light has been imparted to the world by revelations to\r\nHis chosen servants. “Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy\r\nGhost.” 2 Peter 1:21.\r\n\r\nDuring the first twenty-five hundred years of human history, there was no\r\nwritten revelation. Those who had been taught of God, communicated their\r\nknowledge to others, and it was handed down from father to son, through\r\nsuccessive generations. The preparation of the written word began in the\r\ntime of Moses. Inspired revelations were then embodied in an inspired\r\nbook. This work continued during the long period of sixteen hundred\r\nyears,—from Moses, the historian of creation and the law, to John, the\r\nrecorder of the most sublime truths of the gospel.\r\n\r\nThe Bible points to God as its author; yet it was written by human hands;\r\nand in the varied style of its different books it presents the\r\ncharacteristics of the several writers. The truths revealed are all “given\r\nby inspiration of God” (2 Tim. 3:16); yet they are expressed in the words\r\nof men. The Infinite One by His Holy Spirit has shed light into the minds\r\nand hearts of His servants. He has given dreams and visions, symbols and\r\nfigures; and those to whom the truth was thus revealed, have themselves\r\nembodied the thought in human language.\r\n\r\nThe ten commandments were spoken by God Himself, and were written by His\r\nown hand. They are of divine, and not of human composition. But the Bible,\r\nwith its God-given truths expressed in the language of men, presents a\r\nunion of the divine and the human. Such a union existed in the nature of\r\nChrist, who was the Son of God and the Son of man. Thus it is true of the\r\nBible, as it was of Christ, that “the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among\r\nus.” John 1:14.\r\n\r\nWritten in different ages, by men who differed widely in rank and\r\noccupation, and in mental and spiritual endowments, the books of the Bible\r\npresent a wide contrast in style, as well as a diversity in the nature of\r\nthe subjects unfolded. Different forms of expression are employed by\r\ndifferent writers; often the same truth is more strikingly presented by\r\none than by another. And as several writers present a subject under varied\r\naspects and relations, there may appear, to the superficial, careless, or\r\nprejudiced reader, to be discrepancy or contradiction, where the\r\nthoughtful, reverent student, with clearer insight, discerns the\r\nunderlying harmony.\r\n\r\nAs presented through different individuals, the truth is brought out in\r\nits varied aspects. One writer is more strongly impressed with one phase\r\nof the subject; he grasps those points that harmonize with his experience\r\nor with his power of perception and appreciation; another seizes upon a\r\ndifferent phase; and each, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, presents\r\nwhat is most forcibly impressed upon his own mind—a different aspect of\r\nthe truth in each, but a perfect harmony through all. And the truths thus\r\nrevealed unite to form a perfect whole, adapted to meet the wants of men\r\nin all the circumstances and experiences of life.\r\n\r\nGod has been pleased to communicate His truth to the world by human\r\nagencies, and He Himself, by His Holy Spirit, qualified men and enabled\r\nthem to do this work. He guided the mind in the selection of what to speak\r\nand what to write. The treasure was intrusted to earthen vessels, yet it\r\nis, none the less, from Heaven. The testimony is conveyed through the\r\nimperfect expression of human language, yet it is the testimony of God;\r\nand the obedient, believing child of God beholds in it the glory of a\r\ndivine power, full of grace and truth.\r\n\r\nIn His word, God has committed to men the knowledge necessary for\r\nsalvation. The Holy Scriptures are to be accepted as an authoritative,\r\ninfallible revelation of His will. They are the standard of character, the\r\nrevealer of doctrines, and the test of experience. “Every scripture\r\ninspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for\r\ncorrection, for instruction which is in righteousness; that the man of God\r\nmay be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.” 2 Tim. 3:16,\r\n17, Revised Version.\r\n\r\nYet the fact that God has revealed His will to men through His word, has\r\nnot rendered needless the continued presence and guiding of the Holy\r\nSpirit. On the contrary, the Spirit was promised by our Saviour, to open\r\nthe Word to His servants, to illuminate and apply its teachings. And since\r\nit was the Spirit of God that inspired the Bible, it is impossible that\r\nthe teaching of the Spirit should ever be contrary to that of the Word.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit was not given—nor can it ever be bestowed—to supersede the\r\nBible; for the Scriptures explicitly state that the word of God is the\r\nstandard by which all teaching and experience must be tested. Says the\r\napostle John, “Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they\r\nare of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.” 1\r\nJohn 4:1. And Isaiah declares, “To the law and to the testimony: if they\r\nspeak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in\r\nthem.” Isa. 8:20.\r\n\r\nGreat reproach has been cast upon the work of the Holy Spirit by the\r\nerrors of a class that, claiming its enlightenment, profess to have no\r\nfurther need of guidance from the word of God. They are governed by\r\nimpressions which they regard as the voice of God in the soul. But the\r\nspirit that controls them is not the Spirit of God. This following of\r\nimpressions, to the neglect of the Scriptures, can lead only to confusion,\r\nto deception and ruin. It serves only to further the designs of the evil\r\none. Since the ministry of the Holy Spirit is of vital importance to the\r\nchurch of Christ, it is one of the devices of Satan, through the errors of\r\nextremists and fanatics, to cast contempt upon the work of the Spirit, and\r\ncause the people of God to neglect this source of strength which our Lord\r\nHimself has provided.\r\n\r\nIn harmony with the word of God, His Spirit was to continue its work\r\nthroughout the period of the gospel dispensation. During the ages while\r\nthe Scriptures of both the Old and the New Testament were being given, the\r\nHoly Spirit did not cease to communicate light to individual minds, apart\r\nfrom the revelations to be embodied in the Sacred Canon. The Bible itself\r\nrelates how, through the Holy Spirit, men received warning, reproof,\r\ncounsel, and instruction, in matters in no way relating to the giving of\r\nthe Scriptures. And mention is made of prophets in different ages, of\r\nwhose utterances nothing is recorded. In like manner, after the close of\r\nthe canon of Scripture, the Holy Spirit was still to continue its work, to\r\nenlighten, warn, and comfort the children of God.\r\n\r\nJesus promised His disciples, “The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost,\r\nwhom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things, and\r\nbring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.”\r\n“When He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth:\r\n... and He will show you things to come.” John 14:26; 16:13. Scripture\r\nplainly teaches that these promises, so far from being limited to\r\napostolic days, extend to the church of Christ in all ages. The Saviour\r\nassures His followers, “I am with you alway, even unto the end of the\r\nworld.” Matt. 28:20. And Paul declares that the gifts and manifestations\r\nof the Spirit were set in the church “for the perfecting of the saints,\r\nfor the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till\r\nwe all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of\r\nGod, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of\r\nChrist.” Eph. 4:12, 13.\r\n\r\nFor the believers at Ephesus the apostle prayed, “That the God of our Lord\r\nJesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the _Spirit of wisdom\r\nand revelation_ in the knowledge of Him: _the eyes of your understanding\r\nbeing enlightened_; that ye may know what is the hope of His calling, and\r\n... what is the _exceeding greatness_ of His power to us-ward who\r\nbelieve.” Eph. 1:17-19. The ministry of the divine Spirit in enlightening\r\nthe understanding and opening to the mind the deep things of God’s holy\r\nword, was the blessing which Paul thus besought for the Ephesian church.\r\n\r\nAfter the wonderful manifestation of the Holy Spirit on the day of\r\nPentecost, Peter exhorted the people to repentance and baptism in the name\r\nof Christ, for the remission of their sins; and he said: “Ye shall receive\r\nthe gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your\r\nchildren, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God\r\nshall call.” Acts 2:38, 39.\r\n\r\nIn immediate connection with the scenes of the great day of God, the Lord\r\nby the prophet Joel has promised a special manifestation of His Spirit.\r\nJoel 2:28. This prophecy received a partial fulfilment in the outpouring\r\nof the Spirit on the day of Pentecost; but it will reach its full\r\naccomplishment in the manifestation of divine grace which will attend the\r\nclosing work of the gospel.\r\n\r\nThe great controversy between good and evil will increase in intensity to\r\nthe very close of time. In all ages the wrath of Satan has been manifested\r\nagainst the church of Christ; and God has bestowed His grace and Spirit\r\nupon His people to strengthen them to stand against the power of the evil\r\none. When the apostles of Christ were to bear His gospel to the world and\r\nto record it for all future ages, they were especially endowed with the\r\nenlightenment of the Spirit. But as the church approaches her final\r\ndeliverance, Satan is to work with greater power. He comes down “having\r\ngreat wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” Rev.\r\n12:12. He will work “with all power and signs and lying wonders.” 2 Thess.\r\n2:9. For six thousand years that master-mind that once was highest among\r\nthe angels of God, has been wholly bent to the work of deception and ruin.\r\nAnd all the depths of satanic skill and subtlety acquired, all the cruelty\r\ndeveloped, during these struggles of the ages, will be brought to bear\r\nagainst God’s people in the final conflict. And in this time of peril the\r\nfollowers of Christ are to bear to the world the warning of the Lord’s\r\nsecond advent; and a people are to be prepared to stand before Him at His\r\ncoming, “without spot, and blameless.” 2 Peter 3:14. At this time the\r\nspecial endowment of divine grace and power is not less needful to the\r\nchurch than in apostolic days.\r\n\r\nThrough the illumination of the Holy Spirit, the scenes of the\r\nlong-continued conflict between good and evil have been opened to the\r\nwriter of these pages. From time to time I have been permitted to behold\r\nthe working, in different ages, of the great controversy between Christ,\r\nthe Prince of life, the Author of our salvation, and Satan, the prince of\r\nevil, the author of sin, the first transgressor of God’s holy law. Satan’s\r\nenmity against Christ has been manifested against His followers. The same\r\nhatred of the principles of God’s law, the same policy of deception, by\r\nwhich error is made to appear as truth, by which human laws are\r\nsubstituted for the law of God, and men are led to worship the creature\r\nrather than the Creator, may be traced in all the history of the past.\r\nSatan’s efforts to misrepresent the character of God, to cause men to\r\ncherish a false conception of the Creator, and thus to regard Him with\r\nfear and hate rather than with love; his endeavors to set aside the divine\r\nlaw, leading the people to think themselves free from its requirements;\r\nand his persecution of those who dare to resist his deceptions, have been\r\nsteadfastly pursued in all ages. They may be traced in the history of\r\npatriarchs, prophets, and apostles, of martyrs and reformers.\r\n\r\nIn the great final conflict, Satan will employ the same policy, manifest\r\nthe same spirit, and work for the same end, as in all preceding ages. That\r\nwhich has been, will be, except that the coming struggle will be marked\r\nwith a terrible intensity such as the world has never witnessed. Satan’s\r\ndeceptions will be more subtle, his assaults more determined. If it were\r\npossible, he would lead astray the elect. Mark 13:22, Revised Version.\r\n\r\nAs the Spirit of God has opened to my mind the great truths of His word,\r\nand the scenes of the past and the future, I have been bidden to make\r\nknown to others that which has thus been revealed,—to trace the history of\r\nthe controversy in past ages, and especially so to present it as to shed a\r\nlight on the fast-approaching struggle of the future. In pursuance of this\r\npurpose, I have endeavored to select and group together events in the\r\nhistory of the church in such a manner as to trace the unfolding of the\r\ngreat testing truths that at different periods have been given to the\r\nworld, that have excited the wrath of Satan, and the enmity of a\r\nworld-loving church, and that have been maintained by the witness of those\r\nwho “loved not their lives unto the death.”\r\n\r\nIn these records we may see a foreshadowing of the conflict before us.\r\nRegarding them in the light of God’s word, and by the illumination of His\r\nSpirit, we may see unveiled the devices of the wicked one, and the dangers\r\nwhich they must shun who would be found “without fault” before the Lord at\r\nHis coming.\r\n\r\nThe great events which have marked the progress of reform in past ages,\r\nare matters of history, well known and universally acknowledged by the\r\nProtestant world; they are facts which none can gainsay. This history I\r\nhave presented briefly, in accordance with the scope of the book, and the\r\nbrevity which must necessarily be observed, the facts having been\r\ncondensed into as little space as seemed consistent with a proper\r\nunderstanding of their application. In some cases where a historian has so\r\ngrouped together events as to afford, in brief, a comprehensive view of\r\nthe subject, or has summarized details in a convenient manner, his words\r\nhave been quoted; but in some instances no specific credit has been given,\r\nsince the quotations are not given for the purpose of citing that writer\r\nas authority, but because his statement affords a ready and forcible\r\npresentation of the subject. In narrating the experience and views of\r\nthose carrying forward the work of reform in our own time, similar use has\r\nbeen made of their published works.\r\n\r\nIt is not so much the object of this book to present new truths concerning\r\nthe struggles of former times, as to bring out facts and principles which\r\nhave a bearing on coming events. Yet viewed as a part of the controversy\r\nbetween the forces of light and darkness, all these records of the past\r\nare seen to have a new significance; and through them a light is cast upon\r\nthe future, illumining the pathway of those who, like the reformers of\r\npast ages, will be called, even at the peril of all earthly good, to\r\nwitness “for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.”\r\n\r\nTo unfold the scenes of the great controversy between truth and error; to\r\nreveal the wiles of Satan, and the means by which he may be successfully\r\nresisted; to present a satisfactory solution of the great problem of evil,\r\nshedding such a light upon the origin and the final disposition of sin as\r\nto make fully manifest the justice and benevolence of God in all His\r\ndealings with His creatures; and to show the holy, unchanging nature of\r\nHis law, is the object of this book. That through its influence souls may\r\nbe delivered from the power of darkness, and become “partakers of the\r\ninheritance of the saints in light,” to the praise of Him who loved us,\r\nand gave Himself for us, is the earnest prayer of the writer.\r\n\r\nE. G. W.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: Jerusalem From The Mount Of Olives.]\r\n\r\n                   Jerusalem From The Mount Of Olives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: The Destruction Of Jerusalem]\r\n\r\n“If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things\r\nwhich belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. For the\r\ndays shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about\r\nthee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, and shall\r\nlay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they\r\nshall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not\r\nthe time of thy visitation.”(1)\r\n\r\nFrom the crest of Olivet, Jesus looked upon Jerusalem. Fair and peaceful\r\nwas the scene spread out before Him. It was the season of the Passover,\r\nand from all lands the children of Jacob had gathered there to celebrate\r\nthe great national festival. In the midst of gardens and vineyards, and\r\ngreen slopes studded with pilgrims’ tents, rose the terraced hills, the\r\nstately palaces, and massive bulwarks of Israel’s capital. The daughter of\r\nZion seemed in her pride to say, “I sit a queen, and shall see no sorrow;”\r\nas lovely then, and deeming herself as secure in Heaven’s favor, as when,\r\nages before, the royal minstrel sung, “Beautiful for situation, the joy of\r\nthe whole earth, is Mount Zion, ... the city of the great King.”(2) In\r\nfull view were the magnificent buildings of the temple. The rays of the\r\nsetting sun lighted up the snowy whiteness of its marble walls, and\r\ngleamed from golden gate and tower and pinnacle. “The perfection of\r\nbeauty” it stood, the pride of the Jewish nation. What child of Israel\r\ncould gaze upon the scene without a thrill of joy and admiration! But far\r\nother thoughts occupied the mind of Jesus. “When He was come near, He\r\nbeheld the city, and wept over it.”(3) Amid the universal rejoicing of the\r\ntriumphal entry, while palm branches waved, while glad hosannas awoke the\r\nechoes of the hills, and thousands of voices declared Him king, the\r\nworld’s Redeemer was overwhelmed with a sudden and mysterious sorrow. He,\r\nthe Son of God, the Promised One of Israel, whose power had conquered\r\ndeath, and called its captives from the grave, was in tears, not of\r\nordinary grief, but of intense, irrepressible agony.\r\n\r\nHis tears were not for Himself, though He well knew whither His feet were\r\ntending. Before Him lay Gethsemane, the scene of His approaching agony.\r\nThe sheep gate also was in sight, through which for centuries the victims\r\nfor sacrifice had been led, and which was to open for Him when He should\r\nbe “brought as a lamb to the slaughter.”(4) Not far distant was Calvary,\r\nthe place of crucifixion. Upon the path which Christ was soon to tread\r\nmust fall the horror of great darkness as He should make His soul an\r\noffering for sin. Yet it was not the contemplation of these scenes that\r\ncast the shadow upon Him in this hour of gladness. No foreboding of His\r\nown superhuman anguish clouded that unselfish spirit. He wept for the\r\ndoomed thousands of Jerusalem—because of the blindness and impenitence of\r\nthose whom He came to bless and to save.\r\n\r\nThe history of more than a thousand years of God’s special favor and\r\nguardian care, manifested to the chosen people, was open to the eye of\r\nJesus. There was Mount Moriah, where the son of promise, an unresisting\r\nvictim, had been bound to the altar,—emblem of the offering of the Son of\r\nGod.(5) There, the covenant of blessing, the glorious Messianic promise,\r\nhad been confirmed to the father of the faithful. There, the flames of the\r\nsacrifice ascending to heaven from the threshing-floor of Ornan had turned\r\naside the sword of the destroying angel(6)—fitting symbol of the Saviour’s\r\nsacrifice and mediation for guilty men. Jerusalem had been honored of God\r\nabove all the earth. The Lord had “chosen Zion,” He had “desired it for\r\nHis habitation.”(7) There, for ages, holy prophets had uttered their\r\nmessages of warning. There, priests had waved their censers, and the cloud\r\nof incense, with the prayers of the worshipers, had ascended before God.\r\nThere, daily the blood of slain lambs had been offered, pointing forward\r\nto the Lamb of God. There, Jehovah had revealed His presence in the cloud\r\nof glory above the mercy-seat. There, rested the base of that mystic\r\nladder connecting earth with heaven,(8)—that ladder upon which angels of\r\nGod descended and ascended, and which opened to the world the way into the\r\nholiest of all. Had Israel as a nation preserved her allegiance to Heaven,\r\nJerusalem would have stood forever, the elect of God.(9) But the history\r\nof that favored people was a record of backsliding and rebellion. They had\r\nresisted Heaven’s grace, abused their privileges, and slighted their\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\nAlthough Israel had “mocked the messengers of God, and despised His words,\r\nand misused His prophets,”(10) He had still manifested Himself to them, as\r\n“the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in\r\ngoodness and truth;”(11) notwithstanding repeated rejections, His mercy\r\nhad continued its pleadings. With more than a father’s pitying love for\r\nthe son of his care, God had “sent to them by His messengers, rising up\r\nbetimes, and sending; because He had compassion on His people, and on His\r\ndwelling-place.”(12) When remonstrance, entreaty, and rebuke had failed,\r\nHe sent to them the best gift of heaven; nay, He poured out all heaven in\r\nthat one Gift.\r\n\r\nThe Son of God Himself was sent to plead with the impenitent city. It was\r\nChrist that had brought Israel as a goodly vine out of Egypt.(13) His own\r\nhand had cast out the heathen before it. He had planted it “in a very\r\nfruitful hill.”(14) His guardian care had hedged it about. His servants\r\nhad been sent to nurture it. “What could have been done more to My\r\nvineyard,” He exclaims, “that I have not done in it?”(15) Though when He\r\n“looked that it should bring forth grapes, it brought forth wild\r\ngrapes,”(16) yet with a still yearning hope of fruitfulness He came in\r\nperson to His vineyard, if haply it might be saved from destruction. He\r\ndigged about His vine; He pruned and cherished it. He was unwearied in His\r\nefforts to save this vine of His own planting.\r\n\r\nFor three years the Lord of light and glory had gone in and out among His\r\npeople. He “went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of\r\nthe devil,”(17) binding up the broken-hearted, setting at liberty them\r\nthat were bound, restoring sight to the blind, causing the lame to walk\r\nand the deaf to hear, cleansing the lepers, raising the dead, and\r\npreaching the gospel to the poor. To all classes alike was addressed the\r\ngracious call, “Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I\r\nwill give you rest.”(18)\r\n\r\nThough rewarded with evil for good, and hatred for His love,(19) He had\r\nsteadfastly pursued His mission of mercy. Never were those repelled that\r\nsought His grace. A homeless wanderer, reproach and penury His daily lot,\r\nHe lived to minister to the needs and lighten the woes of men, to plead\r\nwith them to accept the gift of life. The waves of mercy, beaten back by\r\nthose stubborn hearts, returned in a stronger tide of pitying,\r\ninexpressible love. But Israel had turned from her best Friend and only\r\nHelper. The pleadings of His love had been despised, His counsels spurned,\r\nHis warnings ridiculed.\r\n\r\nThe hour of hope and pardon was fast passing; the cup of God’s\r\nlong-deferred wrath was almost full. The cloud that had been gathering\r\nthrough ages of apostasy and rebellion, now black with woe, was about to\r\nburst upon a guilty people; and He who alone could save them from their\r\nimpending fate had been slighted, abused, rejected, and was soon to be\r\ncrucified. When Christ should hang upon the cross of Calvary, Israel’s day\r\nas a nation favored and blessed of God would be ended. The loss of even\r\none soul is a calamity infinitely outweighing the gains and treasures of a\r\nworld; but as Christ looked upon Jerusalem, the doom of a whole city, a\r\nwhole nation, was before Him,—that city, that nation, which had once been\r\nthe chosen of God, His peculiar treasure.\r\n\r\nProphets had wept over the apostasy of Israel, and the terrible\r\ndesolations by which their sins were visited. Jeremiah wished that his\r\neyes were a fountain of tears, that he might weep day and night for the\r\nslain of the daughter of his people, for the Lord’s flock that was carried\r\naway captive.(20) What, then, was the grief of Him whose prophetic glance\r\ntook in, not years, but ages! He beheld the destroying angel with sword\r\nuplifted against the city which had so long been Jehovah’s dwelling-place.\r\nFrom the ridge of Olivet, the very spot afterward occupied by Titus and\r\nhis army, He looked across the valley upon the sacred courts and\r\nporticoes, and with tear-dimmed eyes He saw, in awful perspective, the\r\nwalls surrounded by alien hosts. He heard the tread of armies marshaling\r\nfor war. He heard the voice of mothers and children crying for bread in\r\nthe besieged city. He saw her holy and beautiful house, her palaces and\r\ntowers, given to the flames, and where once they stood, only a heap of\r\nsmouldering ruins.\r\n\r\nLooking down the ages, He saw the covenant people scattered in every land,\r\n“like wrecks on a desert shore.” In the temporal retribution about to fall\r\nupon her children, He saw but the first draught from that cup of wrath\r\nwhich at the final judgment she must drain to its dregs. Divine pity,\r\nyearning love, found utterance in the mournful words: “ ‘O Jerusalem,\r\nJerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent\r\nunto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as\r\na hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!’(21) O\r\nthat thou, a nation favored above every other, hadst known the time of thy\r\nvisitation, and the things that belong unto thy peace! I have stayed the\r\nangel of justice, I have called thee to repentance, but in vain. It is not\r\nmerely servants, delegates, and prophets, whom thou hast refused and\r\nrejected, but the Holy One of Israel, thy Redeemer. If thou art destroyed,\r\nthou alone art responsible. ‘Ye will not come to Me, that ye might have\r\nlife.’ ”(22)\r\n\r\nChrist saw in Jerusalem a symbol of the world hardened in unbelief and\r\nrebellion, and hastening on to meet the retributive judgments of God. The\r\nwoes of a fallen race, pressing upon His soul, forced from His lips that\r\nexceeding bitter cry. He saw the record of sin traced in human misery,\r\ntears, and blood; His heart was moved with infinite pity for the afflicted\r\nand suffering ones of earth; He yearned to relieve them all. But even His\r\nhand might not turn back the tide of human woe; few would seek their only\r\nSource of help. He was willing to pour out His soul unto death, to bring\r\nsalvation within their reach; but few would come to Him that they might\r\nhave life.\r\n\r\nThe Majesty of heaven in tears! the Son of the infinite God troubled in\r\nspirit, bowed down with anguish! The scene filled all heaven with wonder.\r\nThat scene reveals to us the exceeding sinfulness of sin; it shows how\r\nhard a task it is, even for infinite power, to save the guilty from the\r\nconsequences of transgressing the law of God. Jesus, looking down to the\r\nlast generation, saw the world involved in a deception similar to that\r\nwhich caused the destruction of Jerusalem. The great sin of the Jews was\r\ntheir rejection of Christ; the great sin of the Christian world would be\r\ntheir rejection of the law of God, the foundation of His government in\r\nheaven and earth. The precepts of Jehovah would be despised and set at\r\nnaught. Millions in bondage to sin, slaves of Satan, doomed to suffer the\r\nsecond death, would refuse to listen to the words of truth in their day of\r\nvisitation. Terrible blindness! strange infatuation!\r\n\r\nTwo days before the Passover, when Christ had for the last time departed\r\nfrom the temple, after denouncing the hypocrisy of the Jewish rulers, He\r\nagain went out with His disciples to the Mount of Olives, and seated\r\nHimself with them upon the grassy slope overlooking the city. Once more He\r\ngazed upon its walls, its towers, and its palaces. Once more He beheld the\r\ntemple in its dazzling splendor, a diadem of beauty crowning the sacred\r\nmount.\r\n\r\nA thousand years before, the psalmist had magnified God’s favor to Israel\r\nin making her holy house His dwelling-place: “In Salem also is His\r\ntabernacle, and His dwelling-place in Zion.”(23) He “chose the tribe of\r\nJudah, the Mount Zion which He loved. And He built His sanctuary like high\r\npalaces.”(24) The first temple had been erected during the most prosperous\r\nperiod of Israel’s history. Vast stores of treasure for this purpose had\r\nbeen collected by King David, and the plans for its construction were made\r\nby divine inspiration.(25) Solomon, the wisest of Israel’s monarchs, had\r\ncompleted the work. This temple was the most magnificent building which\r\nthe world ever saw. Yet the Lord had declared by the prophet Haggai,\r\nconcerning the second temple, “The glory of this latter house shall be\r\ngreater than of the former.” “I will shake all nations, and the Desire of\r\nall nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the\r\nLord of hosts.”(26)\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar, it was rebuilt\r\nabout five hundred years before the birth of Christ, by a people who from\r\na life-long captivity had returned to a wasted and almost deserted\r\ncountry. There were then among them aged men who had seen the glory of\r\nSolomon’s temple, and who wept at the foundation of the new building, that\r\nit must be so inferior to the former. The feeling that prevailed is\r\nforcibly described by the prophet: “Who is left among you that saw this\r\nhouse in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes\r\nin comparison of it as nothing?”(27) Then was given the promise that the\r\nglory of this latter house should be greater than that of the former.\r\n\r\nBut the second temple had not equaled the first in magnificence; nor was\r\nit hallowed by those visible tokens of the divine presence which pertained\r\nto the first temple. There was no manifestation of supernatural power to\r\nmark its dedication. No cloud of glory was seen to fill the newly erected\r\nsanctuary. No fire from heaven descended to consume the sacrifice upon its\r\naltar. The shekinah no longer abode between the cherubim in the most holy\r\nplace; the ark, the mercy-seat, and the tables of the testimony were not\r\nto be found therein. No voice sounded from heaven to make known to the\r\ninquiring priest the will of Jehovah.\r\n\r\nFor centuries the Jews had vainly endeavored to show wherein the promise\r\nof God given by Haggai, had been fulfilled; yet pride and unbelief blinded\r\ntheir minds to the true meaning of the prophet’s words. The second temple\r\nwas not honored with the cloud of Jehovah’s glory, but with the living\r\npresence of One in whom dwelt the fulness of the Godhead bodily—who was\r\nGod Himself manifest in the flesh. The “Desire of all nations” had indeed\r\ncome to His temple when the Man of Nazareth taught and healed in the\r\nsacred courts. In the presence of Christ, and in this only, did the second\r\ntemple exceed the first in glory. But Israel had put from her the\r\nproffered Gift of heaven. With the humble Teacher who had that day passed\r\nout from its golden gate, the glory had forever departed from the temple.\r\nAlready were the Saviour’s words fulfilled, “Your house is left unto you\r\ndesolate.”(28)\r\n\r\nThe disciples had been filled with awe and wonder at Christ’s prediction\r\nof the overthrow of the temple, and they desired to understand more fully\r\nthe meaning of His words. Wealth, labor, and architectural skill had for\r\nmore than forty years been freely expended to enhance its splendors. Herod\r\nthe Great had lavished upon it both Roman wealth and Jewish treasure, and\r\neven the emperor of the world had enriched it with his gifts. Massive\r\nblocks of white marble, of almost fabulous size, forwarded from Rome for\r\nthis purpose, formed a part of its structure; and to these the disciples\r\nhad called the attention of their Master, saying, “See what manner of\r\nstones and what buildings are here!”(29)\r\n\r\nTo these words, Jesus made the solemn and startling reply, “Verily I say\r\nunto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall\r\nnot be thrown down.”(30)\r\n\r\nWith the overthrow of Jerusalem the disciples associated the events of\r\nChrist’s personal coming in temporal glory to take the throne of universal\r\nempire, to punish the impenitent Jews, and to break from off the nation\r\nthe Roman yoke. The Lord had told them that He would come the second time.\r\nHence at the mention of judgments upon Jerusalem, their minds reverted to\r\nthat coming; and as they were gathered about the Saviour upon the Mount of\r\nOlives, they asked, “When shall these things be? and what shall be the\r\nsign of Thy coming, and of the end of the world?”(31)\r\n\r\nThe future was mercifully veiled from the disciples. Had they at that time\r\nfully comprehended the two awful facts,—the Redeemer’s sufferings and\r\ndeath, and the destruction of their city and temple,—they would have been\r\noverwhelmed with horror. Christ presented before them an outline of the\r\nprominent events to take place before the close of time. His words were\r\nnot then fully understood; but their meaning was to be unfolded as His\r\npeople should need the instruction therein given. The prophecy which He\r\nuttered was twofold in its meaning: while foreshadowing the destruction of\r\nJerusalem, it prefigured also the terrors of the last great day.\r\n\r\nJesus declared to the listening disciples the judgments that were to fall\r\nupon apostate Israel, and especially the retributive vengeance that would\r\ncome upon them for their rejection and crucifixion of the Messiah.\r\nUnmistakable signs would precede the awful climax. The dreaded hour would\r\ncome suddenly and swiftly. And the Saviour warned His followers: “When ye\r\ntherefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the\r\nprophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)\r\nthen let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains.”(32) When the\r\nidolatrous standards of the Romans should be set up in the holy ground,\r\nwhich extended some furlongs outside the city walls, then the followers of\r\nChrist were to find safety in flight. When the warning sign should be\r\nseen, those who would escape must make no delay. Throughout the land of\r\nJudea, as well as in Jerusalem itself, the signal for flight must be\r\nimmediately obeyed. He who chanced to be upon the housetop must not go\r\ndown into his house, even to save his most valued treasures. Those who\r\nwere working in the fields or vineyards must not take time to return for\r\nthe outer garment laid aside while they should be toiling in the heat of\r\nthe day. They must not hesitate a moment, lest they be involved in the\r\ngeneral destruction.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Herod, Jerusalem had not only been greatly beautified, but\r\nby the erection of towers, walls, and fortresses, adding to the natural\r\nstrength of its situation, it had been rendered apparently impregnable. He\r\nwho would at this time have foretold publicly its destruction, would, like\r\nNoah in his day, have been called a crazed alarmist. But Christ had said,\r\n“Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away.”(33)\r\nBecause of her sins, wrath had been denounced against Jerusalem, and her\r\nstubborn unbelief rendered her doom certain.\r\n\r\nThe Lord had declared by the prophet Micah: “Hear this, I pray you, ye\r\nheads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that\r\nabhor judgment, and pervert all equity. They build up Zion with blood, and\r\nJerusalem with iniquity. The heads thereof judge for reward, and the\r\npriests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money:\r\nyet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us? none\r\nevil can come upon us.”(34)\r\n\r\nThese words faithfully described the corrupt and self-righteous\r\ninhabitants of Jerusalem. While claiming to observe rigidly the precepts\r\nof God’s law, they were transgressing all its principles. They hated\r\nChrist because His purity and holiness revealed their iniquity; and they\r\naccused Him of being the cause of all the troubles which had come upon\r\nthem in consequence of their sins. Though they knew Him to be sinless,\r\nthey had declared that His death was necessary to their safety as a\r\nnation. “If we let Him thus alone,” said the Jewish leaders, “all men will\r\nbelieve on Him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and\r\nnation.”(35) If Christ were sacrificed, they might once more become a\r\nstrong, united people. Thus they reasoned, and they concurred in the\r\ndecision of their high priest, that it would be better for one man to die\r\nthan for the whole nation to perish.\r\n\r\nThus the Jewish leaders had “built up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with\r\niniquity.” And yet, while they slew their Saviour because He reproved\r\ntheir sins, such was their self-righteousness that they regarded\r\nthemselves as God’s favored people, and expected the Lord to deliver them\r\nfrom their enemies. “Therefore,” continued the prophet, “shall Zion for\r\nyour sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the\r\nmountain of the house as the high places of the forest.”(36)\r\n\r\nFor nearly forty years after the doom of Jerusalem had been pronounced by\r\nChrist Himself, the Lord delayed His judgments upon the city and the\r\nnation. Wonderful was the long-suffering of God toward the rejecters of\r\nHis gospel and the murderers of His Son. The parable of the unfruitful\r\ntree represented God’s dealings with the Jewish nation. The command had\r\ngone forth, “Cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?”(37) but divine\r\nmercy had spared it yet a little longer. There were still many among the\r\nJews who were ignorant of the character and the work of Christ. And the\r\nchildren had not enjoyed the opportunities or received the light which\r\ntheir parents had spurned. Through the preaching of the apostles and their\r\nassociates, God would cause light to shine upon them; they would be\r\npermitted to see how prophecy had been fulfilled, not only in the birth\r\nand life of Christ, but in His death and resurrection. The children were\r\nnot condemned for the sins of the parents; but when, with a knowledge of\r\nall the light given to their parents, the children rejected the additional\r\nlight granted to themselves, they became partakers of the parents’ sins,\r\nand filled up the measure of their iniquity.\r\n\r\nThe long-suffering of God toward Jerusalem only confirmed the Jews in\r\ntheir stubborn impenitence. In their hatred and cruelty toward the\r\ndisciples of Jesus, they rejected the last offer of mercy. Then God\r\nwithdrew His protection from them, and removed His restraining power from\r\nSatan and his angels, and the nation was left to the control of the leader\r\nshe had chosen. Her children had spurned the grace of Christ, which would\r\nhave enabled them to subdue their evil impulses, and now these became the\r\nconquerors. Satan aroused the fiercest and most debased passions of the\r\nsoul. Men did not reason; they were beyond reason,—controlled by impulse\r\nand blind rage. They became satanic in their cruelty. In the family and in\r\nthe nation, among the highest and the lowest classes alike, there was\r\nsuspicion, envy, hatred, strife, rebellion, murder. There was no safety\r\nanywhere. Friends and kindred betrayed one another. Parents slew their\r\nchildren and children their parents. The rulers of the people had no power\r\nto rule themselves. Uncontrolled passions made them tyrants. The Jews had\r\naccepted false testimony to condemn the innocent Son of God. Now false\r\naccusations made their own lives uncertain. By their actions they had long\r\nbeen saying, “Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.”(38)\r\nNow their desire was granted. The fear of God no longer disturbed them.\r\nSatan was at the head of the nation, and the highest civil and religious\r\nauthorities were under his sway.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the opposing factions at times united to plunder and\r\ntorture their wretched victims, and again they fell upon each other’s\r\nforces, and slaughtered without mercy. Even the sanctity of the temple\r\ncould not restrain their horrible ferocity. The worshipers were stricken\r\ndown before the altar, and the sanctuary was polluted with the bodies of\r\nthe slain. Yet in their blind and blasphemous presumption the instigators\r\nof this hellish work publicly declared that they had no fear that\r\nJerusalem would be destroyed, for it was God’s own city. To establish\r\ntheir power more firmly, they bribed false prophets to proclaim, even\r\nwhile Roman legions were besieging the temple, that the people were to\r\nwait for deliverance from God. To the last, multitudes held fast to the\r\nbelief that the Most High would interpose for the defeat of their\r\nadversaries. But Israel had spurned the divine protection, and now she had\r\nno defense. Unhappy Jerusalem! rent by internal dissensions, the blood of\r\nher children slain by one another’s hands crimsoning her streets, while\r\nalien armies beat down her fortifications and slew her men of war!\r\n\r\nAll the predictions given by Christ concerning the destruction of\r\nJerusalem were fulfilled to the letter. The Jews experienced the truth of\r\nHis words of warning, “With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to\r\nyou again.”(39)\r\n\r\nSigns and wonders appeared, foreboding disaster and doom. In the midst of\r\nthe night an unnatural light shone over the temple and the altar. Upon the\r\nclouds at sunset were pictured chariots and men of war gathering for\r\nbattle. The priests ministering by night in the sanctuary were terrified\r\nby mysterious sounds; the earth trembled, and a multitude of voices were\r\nheard crying, “Let us depart hence.” The great eastern gate, which was so\r\nheavy that it could hardly be shut by a score of men, and which was\r\nsecured by immense bars of iron fastened deep in the pavement of solid\r\nstone, opened at midnight, without visible agency.(40)\r\n\r\nFor seven years a man continued to go up and down the streets of\r\nJerusalem, declaring the woes that were to come upon the city. By day and\r\nby night he chanted the wild dirge, “A voice from the east! a voice from\r\nthe west! a voice from the four winds! a voice against Jerusalem and\r\nagainst the temple! a voice against the bridegrooms and the brides! a\r\nvoice against the whole people!” This strange being was imprisoned and\r\nscourged, but no complaint escaped his lips. To insult and abuse he\r\nanswered only, “Woe, woe to Jerusalem!” “woe, woe to the inhabitants\r\nthereof!” His warning cry ceased not until he was slain in the siege he\r\nhad foretold.\r\n\r\nNot one Christian perished in the destruction of Jerusalem. Christ had\r\ngiven His disciples warning, and all who believed His words watched for\r\nthe promised sign. “When ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies,”\r\nsaid Jesus, “then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. Then let them\r\nwhich are in Judea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the\r\nmidst of it depart out.”(41) After the Romans under Cestius had surrounded\r\nthe city, they unexpectedly abandoned the siege when everything seemed\r\nfavorable for an immediate attack. The besieged, despairing of successful\r\nresistance, were on the point of surrender, when the Roman general\r\nwithdrew his forces without the least apparent reason. But God’s merciful\r\nprovidence was directing events for the good of His own people. The\r\npromised sign had been given to the waiting Christians, and now an\r\nopportunity was afforded for all who would, to obey the Saviour’s warning.\r\nEvents were so overruled that neither Jews nor Romans should hinder the\r\nflight of the Christians. Upon the retreat of Cestius, the Jews, sallying\r\nfrom Jerusalem, pursued after his retiring army; and while both forces\r\nwere thus fully engaged, the Christians had an opportunity to leave the\r\ncity. At this time the country also had been cleared of enemies who might\r\nhave endeavored to intercept them. At the time of the siege, the Jews were\r\nassembled at Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Tabernacles, and thus the\r\nChristians throughout the land were able to make their escape unmolested.\r\nWithout delay they fled to a place of safety,—the city of Pella, in the\r\nland of Perea, beyond Jordan.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish forces, pursuing after Cestius and his army, fell upon their\r\nrear with such fierceness as to threaten them with total destruction. It\r\nwas with great difficulty that the Romans succeeded in making their\r\nretreat. The Jews escaped almost without loss, and with their spoils\r\nreturned in triumph to Jerusalem. Yet this apparent success brought them\r\nonly evil. It inspired them with that spirit of stubborn resistance to the\r\nRomans which speedily brought unutterable woe upon the doomed city.\r\n\r\nTerrible were the calamities that fell upon Jerusalem when the siege was\r\nresumed by Titus. The city was invested at the time of the Passover, when\r\nmillions of Jews were assembled within its walls. Their stores of\r\nprovision, which if carefully preserved would have supplied the\r\ninhabitants for years, had previously been destroyed through the jealousy\r\nand revenge of the contending factions, and now all the horrors of\r\nstarvation were experienced. A measure of wheat was sold for a talent. So\r\nfierce were the pangs of hunger that men would gnaw the leather of their\r\nbelts and sandals and the covering of their shields. Great numbers of the\r\npeople would steal out at night to gather wild plants growing outside the\r\ncity walls, though many were seized and put to death with cruel torture,\r\nand often those who returned in safety were robbed of what they had\r\ngleaned at so great peril. The most inhuman tortures were inflicted by\r\nthose in power, to force from the want-stricken people the last scanty\r\nsupplies which they might have concealed. And these cruelties were not\r\ninfrequently practised by men who were themselves well fed, and who were\r\nmerely desirous of laying up a store of provision for the future.\r\n\r\nThousands perished from famine and pestilence. Natural affection seemed to\r\nhave been destroyed. Husbands robbed their wives, and wives their\r\nhusbands. Children would be seen snatching the food from the mouths of\r\ntheir aged parents. The question of the prophet, “Can a woman forget her\r\nsucking child?”(42) received the answer within the walls of that doomed\r\ncity, “The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they\r\nwere their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.”(43)\r\nAgain was fulfilled the warning prophecy given fourteen centuries before:\r\n“The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set\r\nthe sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her\r\neye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and\r\ntoward her daughter, ... and toward her children which she shall bear: for\r\nshe shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and\r\nstraitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.”(44)\r\n\r\nThe Roman leaders endeavored to strike terror to the Jews, and thus cause\r\nthem to surrender. Those prisoners who resisted when taken, were scourged,\r\ntortured, and crucified before the wall of the city. Hundreds were daily\r\nput to death in this manner, and the dreadful work continued until, along\r\nthe valley of Jehoshaphat and at Calvary, crosses were erected in so great\r\nnumbers that there was scarcely room to move among them. So terribly was\r\nvisited that awful imprecation uttered before the judgment-seat of Pilate:\r\n“His blood be on us, and on our children.”(45)\r\n\r\nTitus would willingly have put an end to the fearful scene, and thus have\r\nspared Jerusalem the full measure of her doom. He was filled with horror\r\nas he saw the bodies of the dead lying in heaps in the valleys. Like one\r\nentranced, he looked from the crest of Olivet upon the magnificent temple,\r\nand gave command that not one stone of it be touched. Before attempting to\r\ngain possession of this stronghold, he made an earnest appeal to the\r\nJewish leaders not to force him to defile the sacred place with blood. If\r\nthey would come forth and fight in any other place, no Roman should\r\nviolate the sanctity of the temple. Josephus himself, in a most eloquent\r\nappeal, entreated them to surrender, to save themselves, their city, and\r\ntheir place of worship. But his words were answered with bitter curses.\r\nDarts were hurled at him, their last human mediator, as he stood pleading\r\nwith them. The Jews had rejected the entreaties of the Son of God, and now\r\nexpostulation and entreaty only made them more determined to resist to the\r\nlast. In vain were the efforts of Titus to save the temple; One greater\r\nthan he had declared that not one stone was to be left upon another.\r\n\r\nThe blind obstinacy of the Jewish leaders, and the detestable crimes\r\nperpetrated within the besieged city, excited the horror and indignation\r\nof the Romans, and Titus at last decided to take the temple by storm. He\r\ndetermined, however, that if possible it should be saved from destruction.\r\nBut his commands were disregarded. After he had retired to his tent at\r\nnight, the Jews, sallying from the temple, attacked the soldiers without.\r\nIn the struggle, a firebrand was flung by a soldier through an opening in\r\nthe porch, and immediately the cedar-lined chambers about the holy house\r\nwere in a blaze. Titus rushed to the place, followed by his generals and\r\nlegionaries, and commanded the soldiers to quench the flames. His words\r\nwere unheeded. In their fury the soldiers hurled blazing brands into the\r\nchambers adjoining the temple, and then with their swords they slaughtered\r\nin great numbers those who had found shelter there. Blood flowed down the\r\ntemple steps like water. Thousands upon thousands of Jews perished. Above\r\nthe sound of battle, voices were heard shouting, “Ichabod!”—the glory is\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\n“Titus found it impossible to check the rage of the soldiery; he entered\r\nwith his officers, and surveyed the interior of the sacred edifice. The\r\nsplendor filled them with wonder; and as the flames had not yet penetrated\r\nto the holy place, he made a last effort to save it, and springing forth,\r\nagain exhorted the soldiers to stay the progress of the conflagration. The\r\ncenturion Liberalis endeavored to force obedience with his staff of\r\noffice; but even respect for the emperor gave way to the furious animosity\r\nagainst the Jews, to the fierce excitement of battle, and to the\r\ninsatiable hope of plunder. The soldiers saw everything around them\r\nradiant with gold, which shone dazzlingly in the wild light of the flames;\r\nthey supposed that incalculable treasures were laid up in the sanctuary. A\r\nsoldier, unperceived, thrust a lighted torch between the hinges of the\r\ndoor: the whole building was in flames in an instant. The blinding smoke\r\nand fire forced the officers to retreat, and the noble edifice was left to\r\nits fate.\r\n\r\n“It was an appalling spectacle to the Roman—what was it to the Jew? The\r\nwhole summit of the hill which commanded the city, blazed like a volcano.\r\nOne after another the buildings fell in, with a tremendous crash, and were\r\nswallowed up in the fiery abyss. The roofs of cedar were like sheets of\r\nflame; the gilded pinnacles shone like spikes of red light; the gate\r\ntowers sent up tall columns of flame and smoke. The neighboring hills were\r\nlighted up; and dark groups of people were seen watching in horrible\r\nanxiety the progress of the destruction: the walls and heights of the\r\nupper city were crowded with faces, some pale with the agony of despair,\r\nothers scowling unavailing vengeance. The shouts of the Roman soldiery as\r\nthey ran to and fro, and the howlings of the insurgents who were perishing\r\nin the flames, mingled with the roaring of the conflagration and the\r\nthundering sound of falling timbers. The echoes of the mountains replied\r\nor brought back the shrieks of the people on the heights; all along the\r\nwalls resounded screams and wailings; men who were expiring with famine\r\nrallied their remaining strength to utter a cry of anguish and desolation.\r\n\r\n“The slaughter within was even more dreadful than the spectacle from\r\nwithout. Men and women, old and young, insurgents and priests, those who\r\nfought and those who entreated mercy, were hewn down in indiscriminate\r\ncarnage. The number of the slain exceeded that of the slayers. The\r\nlegionaries had to clamber over heaps of dead to carry on the work of\r\nextermination.”(46)\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction of the temple, the whole city soon fell into the\r\nhands of the Romans. The leaders of the Jews forsook their impregnable\r\ntowers, and Titus found them solitary. He gazed upon them with amazement,\r\nand declared that God had given them into his hands; for no engines,\r\nhowever powerful, could have prevailed against those stupendous\r\nbattlements. Both the city and the temple were razed to their foundations,\r\nand the ground upon which the holy house had stood was “plowed like a\r\nfield.”(47) In the siege and the slaughter that followed, more than a\r\nmillion of the people perished; the survivors were carried away as\r\ncaptives, sold as slaves, dragged to Rome to grace the conqueror’s\r\ntriumph, thrown to wild beasts in the amphitheaters, or scattered as\r\nhomeless wanderers throughout the earth.\r\n\r\nThe Jews had forged their own fetters; they had filled for themselves the\r\ncup of vengeance. In the utter destruction that befell them as a nation,\r\nand in all the woes that followed them in their dispersion, they were but\r\nreaping the harvest which their own hands had sown. Says the prophet, “O\r\nIsrael, thou hast destroyed thyself;” “for thou hast fallen by thine\r\niniquity.”(48) Their sufferings are often represented as a punishment\r\nvisited upon them by the direct decree of God. It is thus that the great\r\ndeceiver seeks to conceal his own work. By stubborn rejection of divine\r\nlove and mercy, the Jews had caused the protection of God to be withdrawn\r\nfrom them, and Satan was permitted to rule them according to his will. The\r\nhorrible cruelties enacted in the destruction of Jerusalem are a\r\ndemonstration of Satan’s vindictive power over those who yield to his\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nWe cannot know how much we owe to Christ for the peace and protection\r\nwhich we enjoy. It is the restraining power of God that prevents mankind\r\nfrom passing fully under the control of Satan. The disobedient and\r\nunthankful have great reason for gratitude for God’s mercy and\r\nlong-suffering in holding in check the cruel, malignant power of the evil\r\none. But when men pass the limits of divine forbearance, that restraint is\r\nremoved. God does not stand toward the sinner as an executioner of the\r\nsentence against transgression; but He leaves the rejecters of His mercy\r\nto themselves, to reap that which they have sown. Every ray of light\r\nrejected, every warning despised or unheeded, every passion indulged,\r\nevery transgression of the law of God, is a seed sown, which yields its\r\nunfailing harvest. The Spirit of God, persistently resisted, is at last\r\nwithdrawn from the sinner, and then there is left no power to control the\r\nevil passions of the soul, and no protection from the malice and enmity of\r\nSatan. The destruction of Jerusalem is a fearful and solemn warning to all\r\nwho are trifling with the offers of divine grace, and resisting the\r\npleadings of divine mercy. Never was there given a more decisive testimony\r\nto God’s hatred of sin, and to the certain punishment that will fall upon\r\nthe guilty.\r\n\r\nThe Saviour’s prophecy concerning the visitation of judgments upon\r\nJerusalem is to have another fulfilment, of which that terrible desolation\r\nwas but a faint shadow. In the fate of the chosen city we may behold the\r\ndoom of a world that has rejected God’s mercy and trampled upon His law.\r\nDark are the records of human misery that earth has witnessed during its\r\nlong centuries of crime. The heart sickens and the mind grows faint in\r\ncontemplation. Terrible have been the results of rejecting the authority\r\nof Heaven. But a scene yet darker is presented in the revelations of the\r\nfuture. The records of the past,—the long procession of tumults,\r\nconflicts, and revolutions, the “battle of the warrior, with confused\r\nnoise, and garments rolled in blood,”(49)—what are these, in contrast with\r\nthe terrors of that day when the restraining Spirit of God shall be wholly\r\nwithdrawn from the wicked, no longer to hold in check the outburst of\r\nhuman passion and satanic wrath! The world will then behold, as never\r\nbefore, the results of Satan’s rule.\r\n\r\nBut in that day, as in the time of Jerusalem’s destruction, God’s people\r\nwill be delivered, “every one that shall be found written among the\r\nliving.” Christ has declared that He will come the second time, to gather\r\nHis faithful ones to Himself: “Then shall all the tribes of the earth\r\nmourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven\r\nwith power and great glory. And He shall send His angels with a great\r\nsound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four\r\nwinds, from one end of heaven to the other.”(50) Then shall they that obey\r\nnot the gospel be consumed with the spirit of His mouth, and be destroyed\r\nwith the brightness of His coming.(51) Like Israel of old, the wicked\r\ndestroy themselves; they fall by their iniquity. By a life of sin, they\r\nhave placed themselves so out of harmony with God, their natures have\r\nbecome so debased with evil, that the manifestation of His glory is to\r\nthem a consuming fire.\r\n\r\nLet men beware lest they neglect the lesson conveyed to them in the words\r\nof Christ. As He warned His disciples of Jerusalem’s destruction, giving\r\nthem a sign of the approaching ruin, that they might make their escape; so\r\nHe has warned the world of the day of final destruction, and has given\r\nthem tokens of its approach, that all who will may flee from the wrath to\r\ncome. Jesus declares, “There shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon,\r\nand in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations.”(52) Those who\r\nbehold these harbingers of His coming are to “know that it is near, even\r\nat the doors.”(53) “Watch ye therefore,”(54) are His words of admonition.\r\nThey that heed the warning shall not be left in darkness, that that day\r\nshould overtake them unawares. But to them that will not watch, “the day\r\nof the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.”(55)\r\n\r\nThe world is no more ready to credit the message for this time than were\r\nthe Jews to receive the Saviour’s warning concerning Jerusalem. Come when\r\nit may, the day of God will come unawares to the ungodly. When life is\r\ngoing on in its unvarying round; when men are absorbed in pleasure, in\r\nbusiness, in traffic, in money-making; when religious leaders are\r\nmagnifying the world’s progress and enlightenment, and the people are\r\nlulled in a false security,—then, as the midnight thief steals within the\r\nunguarded dwelling, so shall sudden destruction come upon the careless and\r\nungodly, “and they shall not escape.”(56)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. PERSECUTION IN THE FIRST CENTURIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nWhen Jesus revealed to His disciples the fate of Jerusalem and the scenes\r\nof the second advent, He foretold also the experience of His people from\r\nthe time when He should be taken from them, to His return in power and\r\nglory for their deliverance. From Olivet the Saviour beheld the storms\r\nabout to fall upon the apostolic church; and penetrating deeper into the\r\nfuture, His eye discerned the fierce, wasting tempests that were to beat\r\nupon His followers in the coming ages of darkness and persecution. In a\r\nfew brief utterances of awful significance, He foretold the portion which\r\nthe rulers of this world would mete out to the church of God.(57) The\r\nfollowers of Christ must tread the same path of humiliation, reproach, and\r\nsuffering which their Master trod. The enmity that burst forth against the\r\nworld’s Redeemer, would be manifested against all who should believe on\r\nHis name.\r\n\r\nThe history of the early church testified to the fulfilment of the\r\nSaviour’s words. The powers of earth and hell arrayed themselves against\r\nChrist in the person of His followers. Paganism foresaw that should the\r\ngospel triumph, her temples and altars would be swept away; therefore she\r\nsummoned her forces to destroy Christianity. The fires of persecution were\r\nkindled. Christians were stripped of their possessions, and driven from\r\ntheir homes. They “endured a great fight of afflictions.”(58) They “had\r\ntrial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and\r\nimprisonment.”(59) Great numbers sealed their testimony with their blood.\r\nNoble and slave, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, were alike slain\r\nwithout mercy.\r\n\r\nThese persecutions, beginning under Nero about the time of the martyrdom\r\nof Paul, continued with greater or less fury for centuries. Christians\r\nwere falsely accused of the most dreadful crimes, and declared to be the\r\ncause of great calamities—famine, pestilence, and earthquake. As they\r\nbecame the objects of popular hatred and suspicion, informers stood ready,\r\nfor the sake of gain, to betray the innocent. They were condemned as\r\nrebels against the empire, as foes of religion, and pests to society.\r\nGreat numbers were thrown to wild beasts or burned alive in the\r\namphitheaters. Some were crucified; others were covered with the skins of\r\nwild animals, and thrust into the arena to be torn by dogs. Their\r\npunishment was often made the chief entertainment at public fêtes. Vast\r\nmultitudes assembled to enjoy the sight, and greeted their dying agonies\r\nwith laughter and applause.\r\n\r\nWherever they sought refuge, the followers of Christ were hunted like\r\nbeasts of prey. They were forced to seek concealment in desolate and\r\nsolitary places. “Destitute, afflicted, tormented; (of whom the world was\r\nnot worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and\r\ncaves of the earth.”(60) The catacombs afforded shelter for thousands.\r\nBeneath the hills outside the city of Rome, long galleries had been\r\ntunneled through earth and rock; the dark and intricate network of\r\npassages extended for miles beyond the city walls. In these underground\r\nretreats, the followers of Christ buried their dead; and here also, when\r\nsuspected and proscribed, they found a home. When the Lifegiver shall\r\nawaken those who have fought the good fight, many a martyr for Christ’s\r\nsake will come forth from those gloomy caverns.\r\n\r\nUnder the fiercest persecution, these witnesses for Jesus kept their faith\r\nunsullied. Though deprived of every comfort, shut away from the light of\r\nthe sun, making their home in the dark but friendly bosom of the earth,\r\nthey uttered no complaint. With words of faith, patience, and hope, they\r\nencouraged one another to endure privation and distress. The loss of every\r\nearthly blessing could not force them to renounce their belief in Christ.\r\nTrials and persecution were but steps bringing them nearer their rest and\r\ntheir reward.\r\n\r\nLike God’s servants of old, many were “tortured, not accepting\r\ndeliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection.”(61) These\r\ncalled to mind the words of their Master, that when persecuted for\r\nChrist’s sake, they were to be exceeding glad, for great would be their\r\nreward in heaven; for so the prophets had been persecuted before them.\r\nThey rejoiced that they were accounted worthy to suffer for the truth, and\r\nsongs of triumph ascended from the midst of crackling flames. Looking\r\nupward by faith, they saw Christ and angels leaning over the battlements\r\nof heaven, gazing upon them with the deepest interest, and regarding their\r\nsteadfastness with approval, A voice came down to them from the throne of\r\nGod, “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of\r\nlife.”(62)\r\n\r\nIn vain were Satan’s efforts to destroy the church of Christ by violence.\r\nThe great controversy in which the disciples of Jesus yielded up their\r\nlives, did not cease when these faithful standard-bearers fell at their\r\npost. By defeat they conquered. God’s workmen were slain, but His work\r\nwent steadily forward. The gospel continued to spread, and the number of\r\nits adherents to increase. It penetrated into regions that were\r\ninaccessible, even to the eagles of Rome. Said a Christian, expostulating\r\nwith the heathen rulers who were urging forward the persecution: You may\r\n“kill us, torture us, condemn us.... Your injustice is the proof that we\r\nare innocent.... Nor does your cruelty ... avail you.” It was but a\r\nstronger invitation to bring others to their persuasion. “The oftener we\r\nare mown down by you, the more in number we grow; the blood of Christians\r\nis seed.”(63)\r\n\r\nThousands were imprisoned and slain; but others sprung up to fill their\r\nplaces. And those who were martyred for their faith were secured to\r\nChrist, and accounted of Him as conquerors. They had fought the good\r\nfight, and they were to receive the crown of glory when Christ should\r\ncome. The sufferings which they endured brought Christians nearer to one\r\nanother and to their Redeemer. Their living example and dying testimony\r\nwere a constant witness for the truth; and where least expected, the\r\nsubjects of Satan were leaving his service, and enlisting under the banner\r\nof Christ.\r\n\r\nSatan therefore laid his plans to war more successfully against the\r\ngovernment of God, by planting his banner in the Christian church. If the\r\nfollowers of Christ could be deceived, and led to displease God, then\r\ntheir strength, fortitude, and firmness would fail, and they would fall an\r\neasy prey.\r\n\r\nThe great adversary now endeavored to gain by artifice what he had failed\r\nto secure by force. Persecution ceased, and in its stead were substituted\r\nthe dangerous allurements of temporal prosperity and worldly honor.\r\nIdolaters were led to receive a part of the Christian faith, while they\r\nrejected other essential truths. They professed to accept Jesus as the Son\r\nof God, and to believe in His death and resurrection; but they had no\r\nconviction of sin, and felt no need of repentance or of a change of heart.\r\nWith some concessions on their part, they proposed that Christians should\r\nmake concessions, that all might unite on the platform of belief in\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nNow the church was in fearful peril. Prison, torture, fire, and sword were\r\nblessings in comparison with this. Some of the Christians stood firm,\r\ndeclaring that they could make no compromise. Others were in favor of\r\nyielding or modifying some features of their faith, and uniting with those\r\nwho had accepted a part of Christianity, urging that this might be the\r\nmeans of their full conversion. That was a time of deep anguish to the\r\nfaithful followers of Christ. Under a cloak of pretended Christianity,\r\nSatan was insinuating himself into the church, to corrupt their faith, and\r\nturn their minds from the word of truth.\r\n\r\nMost of the Christians at last consented to lower their standard, and a\r\nunion was formed between Christianity and paganism. Although the\r\nworshipers of idols professed to be converted, and united with the church,\r\nthey still clung to their idolatry, only changing the objects of their\r\nworship to images of Jesus, and even of Mary and the saints. The foul\r\nleaven of idolatry, thus brought into the church, continued its baleful\r\nwork. Unsound doctrines, superstitious rites, and idolatrous ceremonies\r\nwere incorporated into her faith and worship. As the followers of Christ\r\nunited with idolaters, the Christian religion became corrupted, and the\r\nchurch lost her purity and power. There were some, however, who were not\r\nmisled by these delusions. They still maintained their fidelity to the\r\nAuthor of truth, and worshiped God alone.\r\n\r\nThere have ever been two classes among those who profess to be followers\r\nof Christ. While one class study the Saviour’s life, and earnestly seek to\r\ncorrect their defects and conform to the Pattern, the other class shun the\r\nplain, practical truths which expose their errors. Even in her best\r\nestate, the church was not composed wholly of the true, pure, and sincere.\r\nOur Saviour taught that those who wilfully indulge in sin are not to be\r\nreceived into the church; yet He connected with Himself men who were\r\nfaulty in character, and granted them the benefits of His teachings and\r\nexample, that they might have an opportunity to see their errors and\r\ncorrect them. Among the twelve apostles was a traitor.\r\n\r\nJudas was accepted, not because of his defects of character, but\r\nnotwithstanding them. He was connected with the disciples, that, through\r\nthe instruction and example of Christ, he might learn what constitutes\r\nChristian character, and thus be led to see his errors, to repent, and by\r\nthe aid of divine grace, to purify his soul “in obeying the truth.” But\r\nJudas did not walk in the light so graciously permitted to shine upon him.\r\nBy indulgence in sin, he invited the temptations of Satan. His evil traits\r\nof character became predominant. He yielded his mind to the control of the\r\npowers of darkness, he became angry when his faults were reproved, and\r\nthus he was led to commit the fearful crime of betraying his Master. So do\r\nall who cherish evil under a profession of godliness hate those who\r\ndisturb their peace by condemning their course of sin. When a favorable\r\nopportunity is presented, they will, like Judas, betray those who for\r\ntheir good have sought to reprove them.\r\n\r\nThe apostles encountered those in the church who professed godliness while\r\nthey were secretly cherishing iniquity. Ananias and Sapphira acted the\r\npart of deceivers, pretending to make an entire sacrifice for God, when\r\nthey were covetously withholding a portion for themselves. The Spirit of\r\ntruth revealed to the apostles the real character of these pretenders, and\r\nthe judgments of God rid the church of this foul blot upon its purity.\r\nThis signal evidence of the discerning Spirit of Christ in the church was\r\na terror to hypocrites and evil-doers. They could not long remain in\r\nconnection with those who were, in habit and disposition, constant\r\nrepresentatives of Christ; and as trials and persecution came upon His\r\nfollowers, those only who were willing to forsake all for the truth’s sake\r\ndesired to become His disciples. Thus, as long as persecution continued,\r\nthe church remained comparatively pure. But as it ceased, converts were\r\nadded who were less sincere and devoted, and the way was opened for Satan\r\nto obtain a foothold.\r\n\r\nBut there is no union between the Prince of light and the prince of\r\ndarkness, and there can be no union between their followers. When\r\nChristians consented to unite with those who were but half converted from\r\npaganism, they entered upon a path which led farther and farther from the\r\ntruth. Satan exulted that he had succeeded in deceiving so large a number\r\nof the followers of Christ. He then brought his power to bear more fully\r\nupon these, and inspired them to persecute those who remained true to God.\r\nNone understood so well how to oppose the true Christian faith as did\r\nthose who had once been its defenders; and these apostate Christians,\r\nuniting with their half-pagan companions, directed their warfare against\r\nthe most essential features of the doctrines of Christ.\r\n\r\nIt required a desperate struggle for those who would be faithful to stand\r\nfirm against the deceptions and abominations which were disguised in\r\nsacerdotal garments and introduced into the church. The Bible was not\r\naccepted as the standard of faith. The doctrine of religious freedom was\r\ntermed heresy, and its upholders were hated and proscribed.\r\n\r\nAfter a long and severe conflict, the faithful few decided to dissolve all\r\nunion with the apostate church if she still refused to free herself from\r\nfalsehood and idolatry. They saw that separation was an absolute necessity\r\nif they would obey the word of God. They dared not tolerate errors fatal\r\nto their own souls, and set an example which would imperil the faith of\r\ntheir children and children’s children. To secure peace and unity they\r\nwere ready to make any concession consistent with fidelity to God; but\r\nthey felt that even peace would be too dearly purchased at the sacrifice\r\nof principle. If unity could be secured only by the compromise of truth\r\nand righteousness, then let there be difference, and even war.\r\n\r\nWell would it be for the church and the world if the principles that\r\nactuated those steadfast souls were revived in the hearts of God’s\r\nprofessed people. There is an alarming indifference in regard to the\r\ndoctrines which are the pillars of the Christian faith. The opinion is\r\ngaining ground, that, after all, these are not of vital importance. This\r\ndegeneracy is strengthening the hands of the agents of Satan, so that\r\nfalse theories and fatal delusions which the faithful in ages past\r\nimperiled their lives to resist and expose, are now regarded with favor by\r\nthousands who claim to be followers of Christ.\r\n\r\nThe early Christians were indeed a peculiar people. Their blameless\r\ndeportment and unswerving faith were a continual reproof that disturbed\r\nthe sinner’s peace. Though few in numbers, without wealth, position, or\r\nhonorary titles, they were a terror to evil-doers wherever their character\r\nand doctrines were known. Therefore they were hated by the wicked, even as\r\nAbel was hated by the ungodly Cain. For the same reason that Cain slew\r\nAbel, did those who sought to throw off the restraint of the Holy Spirit,\r\nput to death God’s people. It was for the same reason that the Jews\r\nrejected and crucified the Saviour,—because the purity and holiness of His\r\ncharacter was a constant rebuke to their selfishness and corruption. From\r\nthe days of Christ until now, His faithful disciples have excited the\r\nhatred and opposition of those who love and follow the ways of sin.\r\n\r\nHow, then, can the gospel be called a message of peace? When Isaiah\r\nforetold the birth of the Messiah, he ascribed to Him the title, “Prince\r\nof Peace.” When angels announced to the shepherds that Christ was born,\r\nthey sung above the plains of Bethlehem, “Glory to God in the highest, and\r\non earth peace, good will toward men.”(64) There is a seeming\r\ncontradiction between these prophetic declarations and the words of\r\nChrist, “I came not to send peace, but a sword.”(65) But rightly\r\nunderstood, the two are in perfect harmony. The gospel is a message of\r\npeace. Christianity is a system, which, received and obeyed, would spread\r\npeace, harmony, and happiness throughout the earth. The religion of Christ\r\nwill unite in close brotherhood all who accept its teachings. It was the\r\nmission of Jesus to reconcile men to God, and thus to one another. But the\r\nworld at large are under the control of Satan, Christ’s bitterest foe. The\r\ngospel presents to them principles of life which are wholly at variance\r\nwith their habits and desires, and they rise in rebellion against it. They\r\nhate the purity which reveals and condemns their sins, and they persecute\r\nand destroy those who would urge upon them its just and holy claims. It is\r\nin this sense—because the exalted truths it brings, occasion hatred and\r\nstrife—that the gospel is called a sword.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious providence which permits the righteous to suffer\r\npersecution at the hand of the wicked, has been a cause of great\r\nperplexity to many who are weak in faith. Some are even ready to cast away\r\ntheir confidence in God, because He suffers the basest of men to prosper,\r\nwhile the best and purest are afflicted and tormented by their cruel\r\npower. How, it is asked, can One who is just and merciful, and who is also\r\ninfinite in power, tolerate such injustice and oppression? This is a\r\nquestion with which we have nothing to do. God has given us sufficient\r\nevidence of His love, and we are not to doubt His goodness because we\r\ncannot understand the workings of His providence. Said the Saviour to His\r\ndisciples, foreseeing the doubts that would press upon their souls in days\r\nof trial and darkness: “Remember the word that I said unto you, The\r\nservant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted Me, they\r\nwill also persecute you.”(66) Jesus suffered for us more than any of His\r\nfollowers can be made to suffer through the cruelty of wicked men. Those\r\nwho are called to endure torture and martyrdom, are but following in the\r\nsteps of God’s dear Son.\r\n\r\n“The Lord is not slack concerning His promise.”(67) He does not forget or\r\nneglect His children; but He permits the wicked to reveal their true\r\ncharacter, that none who desire to do His will may be deceived concerning\r\nthem. Again, the righteous are placed in the furnace of affliction, that\r\nthey themselves may be purified; that their example may convince others of\r\nthe reality of faith and godliness; and also that their consistent course\r\nmay condemn the ungodly and unbelieving.\r\n\r\nGod permits the wicked to prosper, and to reveal their enmity against Him,\r\nthat when they shall have filled up the measure of their iniquity, all may\r\nsee His justice and mercy in their utter destruction. The day of His\r\nvengeance hastens, when all who have transgressed His law and oppressed\r\nHis people will meet the just recompense of their deeds; when every act of\r\ncruelty or injustice toward God’s faithful ones will be punished as though\r\ndone to Christ Himself.\r\n\r\nThere is another and more important question that should engage the\r\nattention of the churches of to-day. The apostle Paul declares that “all\r\nthat will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.”(68) Why is\r\nit, then, that persecution seems in a great degree to slumber? The only\r\nreason is, that the church has conformed to the world’s standard, and\r\ntherefore awakens no opposition. The religion which is current in our day\r\nis not of the pure and holy character that marked the Christian faith in\r\nthe days of Christ and His apostles. It is only because of the spirit of\r\ncompromise with sin, because the great truths of the word of God are so\r\nindifferently regarded, because there is so little vital godliness in the\r\nchurch, that Christianity is apparently so popular with the world. Let\r\nthere be a revival of the faith and power of the early church, and the\r\nspirit of persecution will be revived, and the fires of persecution will\r\nbe rekindled.\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: St. Peter’s And The Vatican]\r\n\r\n                       St. Peter’s And The Vatican\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. THE APOSTASY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nThe apostle Paul, in his second letter to the Thessalonians, foretold the\r\ngreat apostasy which would result in the establishment of the papal power.\r\nHe declared that the day of Christ should not come, “except there come a\r\nfalling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;\r\nwho opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is\r\nworshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself\r\nthat he is God.”(69) And furthermore, the apostle warns his brethren that\r\n“the mystery of iniquity doth already work.”(70) Even at that early date\r\nhe saw, creeping into the church, errors that would prepare the way for\r\nthe development of the papacy.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, at first in stealth and silence, and then more openly as\r\nit increased in strength and gained control of the minds of men, the\r\nmystery of iniquity carried forward its deceptive and blasphemous work.\r\nAlmost imperceptibly the customs of heathenism found their way into the\r\nChristian church. The spirit of compromise and conformity was restrained\r\nfor a time by the fierce persecutions which the church endured under\r\npaganism. But as persecution ceased, and Christianity entered the courts\r\nand palaces of kings, she laid aside the humble simplicity of Christ and\r\nHis apostles for the pomp and pride of pagan priests and rulers; and in\r\nplace of the requirements of God, she substituted human theories and\r\ntraditions. The nominal conversion of Constantine, in the early part of\r\nthe fourth century, caused great rejoicing; and the world, cloaked with a\r\nform of righteousness, walked into the church. Now, the work of corruption\r\nrapidly progressed. Paganism, while appearing to be vanquished, became the\r\nconqueror. Her spirit controlled the church. Her doctrines, ceremonies,\r\nand superstitions were incorporated into the faith and worship of the\r\nprofessed followers of Christ.\r\n\r\nThis compromise between paganism and Christianity resulted in the\r\ndevelopment of the “man of sin” foretold in prophecy as opposing and\r\nexalting himself above God. That gigantic system of false religion is a\r\nmasterpiece of Satan’s power,—a monument of his efforts to seat himself\r\nupon the throne to rule the earth according to his will.\r\n\r\nSatan once endeavoured to form a compromise with Christ. He came to the\r\nSon of God in the wilderness of temptation, and showing Him all the\r\nkingdoms of the world and the glory of them, offered to give all into His\r\nhands if He would but acknowledge the supremacy of the prince of darkness.\r\nChrist rebuked the presumptuous tempter, and forced him to depart. But\r\nSatan meets with greater success in presenting the same temptations to\r\nman. To secure worldly gains and honors, the church was led to seek the\r\nfavor and support of the great men of earth; and having thus rejected\r\nChrist, she was induced to yield allegiance to the representative of\r\nSatan,—the bishop of Rome.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the leading doctrines of Romanism that the pope is the\r\nvisible head of the universal church of Christ, invested with supreme\r\nauthority over bishops and pastors in all parts of the world. More than\r\nthis, the pope has been given the very titles of Deity. He has been styled\r\n“Lord God the Pope,”(71) and has been declared infallible. He demands the\r\nhomage of all men. The same claim urged by Satan in the wilderness of\r\ntemptation, is still urged by him through the Church of Rome, and vast\r\nnumbers are ready to yield him homage.\r\n\r\nBut those who fear and reverence God meet this Heaven-daring assumption as\r\nChrist met the solicitations of the wily foe: “Thou shalt worship the Lord\r\nthy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.”(72) God has never given a hint in\r\nHis word that He has appointed any man to be the head of the church. The\r\ndoctrine of papal supremacy is directly opposed to the teachings of the\r\nScriptures. The pope can have no power over Christ’s church except by\r\nusurpation.\r\n\r\nRomanists have persisted in bringing against Protestants the charge of\r\nheresy, and wilful separation from the true church. But these accusations\r\napply rather to themselves. They are the ones who laid down the banner of\r\nChrist, and departed from “the faith which was once delivered unto the\r\nsaints.”(73)\r\n\r\nSatan well knew that the Holy Scriptures would enable men to discern his\r\ndeceptions and withstand his power. It was by the Word that even the\r\nSaviour of the world had resisted his attacks. At every assault, Christ\r\npresented the shield of eternal truth, saying, “It is written.” To every\r\nsuggestion of the adversary, He opposed the wisdom and power of the Word.\r\nIn order for Satan to maintain his sway over men, and establish the\r\nauthority of the papal usurper, he must keep them in ignorance of the\r\nScriptures. The Bible would exalt God, and place finite men in their true\r\nposition; therefore its sacred truths must be concealed and suppressed.\r\nThis logic was adopted by the Roman Church. For hundreds of years the\r\ncirculation of the Bible was prohibited. The people were forbidden to read\r\nit or to have it in their houses, and unprincipled priests and prelates\r\ninterpreted its teachings to sustain their pretensions. Thus the pope came\r\nto be almost universally acknowledged as the vicegerent of God on earth,\r\nendowed with authority over church and state.\r\n\r\nThe detector of error having been removed, Satan worked according to his\r\nwill. Prophecy had declared that the papacy was to “think to change times\r\nand laws.”(74) This work it was not slow to attempt. To afford converts\r\nfrom heathenism a substitute for the worship of idols, and thus to promote\r\ntheir nominal acceptance of Christianity, the adoration of images and\r\nrelics was gradually introduced into the Christian worship. The decree of\r\na general council(75) finally established this system of idolatry. To\r\ncomplete the sacrilegious work, Rome presumed to expunge from the law of\r\nGod the second commandment, forbidding image worship, and to divide the\r\ntenth commandment, in order to preserve the number.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of concession to paganism opened the way for a still further\r\ndisregard of Heaven’s authority. Satan, working through unconsecrated\r\nleaders of the church, tampered with the fourth commandment also, and\r\nessayed to set aside the ancient Sabbath, the day which God had blessed\r\nand sanctified,(76) and in its stead to exalt the festival observed by the\r\nheathen as “the venerable day of the sun.” This change was not at first\r\nattempted openly. In the first centuries the true Sabbath had been kept by\r\nall Christians. They were jealous for the honor of God, and believing that\r\nHis law is immutable, they zealously guarded the sacredness of its\r\nprecepts. But with great subtlety, Satan worked through his agents to\r\nbring about his object. That the attention of the people might be called\r\nto the Sunday, it was made a festival in honor of the resurrection of\r\nChrist. Religious services were held upon it; yet it was regarded as a day\r\nof recreation, the Sabbath being still sacredly observed.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the way for the work which he designed to accomplish, Satan had\r\nled the Jews, before the advent of Christ, to load down the Sabbath with\r\nthe most rigorous exactions, making its observance a burden. Now, taking\r\nadvantage of the false light in which he had thus caused it to be\r\nregarded, he cast contempt upon it as a Jewish institution. While\r\nChristians generally continued to observe the Sunday as a joyous festival,\r\nhe led them, in order to show their hatred of Judaism, to make the Sabbath\r\na fast, a day of sadness and gloom.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the fourth century, the emperor Constantine issued a\r\ndecree making Sunday a public festival throughout the Roman empire.(77)\r\nThe day of the sun was reverenced by his pagan subjects, and was honored\r\nby Christians; it was the emperor’s policy to unite the conflicting\r\ninterests of heathenism and Christianity. He was urged to do this by the\r\nbishops of the church, who, inspired by ambition and thirst for power,\r\nperceived that if the same day was observed by both Christians and\r\nheathen, it would promote the nominal acceptance of Christianity by\r\npagans, and thus advance the power and glory of the church. But while many\r\nGod-fearing Christians were gradually led to regard Sunday as possessing a\r\ndegree of sacredness, they still held the true Sabbath as the holy of the\r\nLord, and observed it in obedience to the fourth commandment.\r\n\r\nThe arch-deceiver had not completed his work. He was resolved to gather\r\nthe Christian world under his banner, and to exercise his power through\r\nhis vicegerent, the proud pontiff who claimed to be the representative of\r\nChrist. Through half-converted pagans, ambitious prelates, and\r\nworld-loving churchmen, he accomplished his purpose. Vast councils were\r\nheld from time to time, in which the dignitaries of the church were\r\nconvened from all the world. In nearly every council the Sabbath which God\r\nhad instituted was pressed down a little lower, while the Sunday was\r\ncorrespondingly exalted. Thus the pagan festival came finally to be\r\nhonored as a divine institution, while the Bible Sabbath was pronounced a\r\nrelic of Judaism, and its observers were declared to be accursed.\r\n\r\nThe great apostate had succeeded in exalting himself “above all that is\r\ncalled God, or that is worshiped.”(78) He had dared to change the only\r\nprecept of the divine law that unmistakably points all mankind to the true\r\nand living God. In the fourth commandment, God is revealed as the Creator\r\nof the heavens and the earth, and is thereby distinguished from all false\r\ngods. It was as a memorial of the work of creation that the seventh day\r\nwas sanctified as a rest-day for man. It was designed to keep the living\r\nGod ever before the minds of men as the source of being and the object of\r\nreverence and worship. Satan strives to turn men from their allegiance to\r\nGod, and from rendering obedience to His law; therefore he directs his\r\nefforts especially against that commandment which points to God as the\r\nCreator.\r\n\r\nProtestants now urge that the resurrection of Christ on Sunday made it the\r\nChristian Sabbath. But Scripture evidence is lacking. No such honor was\r\ngiven to the day by Christ or His apostles. The observance of Sunday as a\r\nChristian institution had its origin in that “mystery of lawlessness”(79)\r\nwhich, even in Paul’s day, had begun its work. Where and when did the Lord\r\nadopt this child of the papacy? What valid reason can be given for a\r\nchange which the Scriptures do not sanction?\r\n\r\nIn the sixth century the papacy had become firmly established. Its seat of\r\npower was fixed in the imperial city, and the bishop of Rome was declared\r\nto be the head over the entire church. Paganism had given place to the\r\npapacy. The dragon had given to the beast “his power, and his seat, and\r\ngreat authority.”(80) And now began the 1260 years of papal oppression\r\nforetold in the prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation.(81) Christians\r\nwere forced to choose either to yield their integrity and accept the papal\r\nceremonies and worship, or to wear away their lives in dungeons or suffer\r\ndeath by the rack, the fagot, or the heads-man’s axe. Now were fulfilled\r\nthe words of Jesus: “Ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren,\r\nand kins-folks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to\r\ndeath. And ye shall be hated of all men for My name’s sake.”(82)\r\nPersecution opened upon the faithful with greater fury than ever before,\r\nand the world became a vast battle-field. For hundreds of years the church\r\nof Christ found refuge in seclusion and obscurity. Thus says the prophet:\r\n“The woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of\r\nGod, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore\r\ndays.”(83)\r\n\r\nThe accession of the Roman Church to power marked the beginning of the\r\nDark Ages. As her power increased, the darkness deepened. Faith was\r\ntransferred from Christ, the true foundation, to the pope of Rome. Instead\r\nof trusting in the Son of God for forgiveness of sins and for eternal\r\nsalvation, the people looked to the pope, and to the priests and prelates\r\nto whom he delegated authority. They were taught that the pope was their\r\nearthly mediator, and that none could approach God except through him; and\r\nfurther, that he stood in the place of God to them, and was therefore to\r\nbe implicitly obeyed. A deviation from his requirements was sufficient\r\ncause for the severest punishment to be visited upon the bodies and souls\r\nof the offenders. Thus the minds of the people were turned away from God\r\nto fallible, erring, and cruel men, nay, more, to the prince of darkness\r\nhimself, who exercised his power through them. Sin was disguised in a garb\r\nof sanctity. When the Scriptures are suppressed, and man comes to regard\r\nhimself as supreme, we need look only for fraud, deception, and debasing\r\niniquity. With the elevation of human laws and traditions, was manifest\r\nthe corruption that ever results from setting aside the law of God.\r\n\r\nThose were days of peril for the church of Christ. The faithful\r\nstandard-bearers were few indeed. Though the truth was not left without\r\nwitnesses, yet at times it seemed that error and superstition would wholly\r\nprevail, and true religion would be banished from the earth. The gospel\r\nwas lost sight of, but the forms of religion were multiplied, and the\r\npeople were burdened with rigorous exactions.\r\n\r\nThey were taught not only to look to the pope as their mediator, but to\r\ntrust to works of their own to atone for sin. Long pilgrimages, acts of\r\npenance, the worship of relics, the erection of churches, shrines, and\r\naltars, the payment of large sums to the church,—these and many similar\r\nacts were enjoined to appease the wrath of God or to secure His favor; as\r\nif God were like men, to be angered at trifles, or pacified by gifts or\r\nacts of penance!\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that vice prevailed, even among the leaders of the Roman\r\nChurch, her influence seemed steadily to increase. About the close of the\r\neighth century, papists put forth the claim that in the first ages of the\r\nchurch the bishops of Rome had possessed the same spiritual power which\r\nthey now assumed. To establish this claim, some means must be employed to\r\ngive it a show of authority; and this was readily suggested by the father\r\nof lies. Ancient writings were forged by monks. Decrees of councils before\r\nunheard of, were discovered, establishing the universal supremacy of the\r\npope from the earliest times. And a church that had rejected the truth,\r\ngreedily accepted these deceptions.(84)\r\n\r\nThe few faithful builders upon the true foundation(85) were perplexed and\r\nhindered, as the rubbish of false doctrine obstructed the work. Like the\r\nbuilders upon the wall of Jerusalem in Nehemiah’s day, some were ready to\r\nsay, “The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much\r\nrubbish; so that we are not able to build.”(86) Wearied with the constant\r\nstruggle against persecution, fraud, iniquity, and every other obstacle\r\nthat Satan could devise to hinder their progress, some who had been\r\nfaithful builders became disheartened; and for the sake of peace and\r\nsecurity for their property and their lives, they turned away from the\r\ntrue foundation. Others, undaunted by the opposition of their enemies,\r\nfearlessly declared, “Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, which\r\nis great and terrible;”(87) and they proceeded with the work, every one\r\nwith his sword girded by his side.(88)\r\n\r\nThe same spirit of hatred and opposition to the truth has inspired the\r\nenemies of God in every age, and the same vigilance and fidelity have been\r\nrequired in His servants. The words of Christ to the first disciples are\r\napplicable to His followers to the close of time: “What I say unto you I\r\nsay unto all, Watch.”(89)\r\n\r\nThe darkness seemed to grow more dense. Image worship became more general.\r\nCandles were burned before images, and prayers were offered to them. The\r\nmost absurd and superstitious customs prevailed. The minds of men were so\r\ncompletely controlled by superstition that reason itself seemed to have\r\nlost its sway. While priests and bishops were themselves pleasure-loving,\r\nsensual, and corrupt, it could only be expected that the people who looked\r\nto them for guidance would be sunken in ignorance and vice.\r\n\r\nAnother step in papal assumption was taken, when, in the eleventh century,\r\nPope Gregory VII. proclaimed the perfection of the Roman Church. Among the\r\npropositions which he put forth, was one declaring that the church had\r\nnever erred, nor would it ever err, according to the Scriptures. But the\r\nScripture proofs did not accompany the assertion. The proud pontiff also\r\nclaimed the power to depose emperors, and declared that no sentence which\r\nhe pronounced could be reversed by any one, but that it was his\r\nprerogative to reverse the decisions of all others.(90)\r\n\r\nA striking illustration of the tyrannical character of this advocate of\r\ninfallibility was given in his treatment of the German emperor, Henry IV.\r\nFor presuming to disregard the pope’s authority, this monarch was declared\r\nto be excommunicated and dethroned. Terrified by the desertion and threats\r\nof his own princes, who were encouraged in rebellion against him by the\r\npapal mandate, Henry felt the necessity of making his peace with Rome. In\r\ncompany with his wife and a faithful servant, he crossed the Alps in\r\nmidwinter, that he might humble himself before the pope. Upon reaching the\r\ncastle whither Gregory had withdrawn, he was conducted, without his\r\nguards, into an outer court, and there, in the severe cold of winter, with\r\nuncovered head and naked feet, and in a miserable dress, he awaited the\r\npope’s permission to come into his presence. Not until he had continued\r\nthree days fasting and making confession, did the pontiff condescend to\r\ngrant him pardon. Even then it was only upon condition that the emperor\r\nshould await the sanction of the pope before resuming the insignia or\r\nexercising the power of royalty. And Gregory, elated with his triumph,\r\nboasted that it was his duty to pull down the pride of kings.\r\n\r\nHow striking the contrast between the overbearing pride of this haughty\r\npontiff and the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who represents Himself\r\nas pleading at the door of the heart for admittance, that He may come in\r\nto bring pardon and peace, and who taught His disciples, “Whosoever will\r\nbe chief among you, let him be your servant.”(91)\r\n\r\nThe advancing centuries witnessed a constant increase of error in the\r\ndoctrines put forth from Rome. Even before the establishment of the\r\npapacy, the teachings of heathen philosophers had received attention and\r\nexerted an influence in the church. Many who professed conversion still\r\nclung to the tenets of their pagan philosophy, and not only continued its\r\nstudy themselves, but urged it upon others as a means of extending their\r\ninfluence among the heathen. Serious errors were thus introduced into the\r\nChristian faith. Prominent among these was the belief in man’s natural\r\nimmortality and his consciousness in death. This doctrine laid the\r\nfoundation upon which Rome established the invocation of saints and the\r\nadoration of the Virgin Mary. From this sprung also the heresy of eternal\r\ntorment for the finally impenitent, which was early incorporated into the\r\npapal faith.\r\n\r\nThen the way was prepared for the introduction of still another invention\r\nof paganism, which Rome named purgatory, and employed to terrify the\r\ncredulous and superstitious multitudes. By this heresy is affirmed the\r\nexistence of a place of torment, in which the souls of such as have not\r\nmerited eternal damnation are to suffer punishment for their sins, and\r\nfrom which, when freed from impurity, they are admitted to heaven.(92)\r\n\r\nStill another fabrication was needed to enable Rome to profit by the fears\r\nand the vices of her adherents. This was supplied by the doctrine of\r\nindulgences. Full remission of sins, past, present, and future, and\r\nrelease from all the pains and penalties incurred, were promised to all\r\nwho would enlist in the pontiff’s wars to extend his temporal dominion, to\r\npunish his enemies, or to exterminate those who dared deny his spiritual\r\nsupremacy. The people were also taught that by the payment of money to the\r\nchurch they might free themselves from sin, and also release the souls of\r\ntheir deceased friends who were confined in the tormenting flames. By such\r\nmeans did Rome fill her coffers, and sustain the magnificence, luxury, and\r\nvice of the pretended representatives of Him who had not where to lay His\r\nhead.(93)\r\n\r\nThe scriptural ordinance of the Lord’s supper had been supplanted by the\r\nidolatrous sacrifice of the mass. Papal priests pretended, by their\r\nsenseless mummery, to convert the simple bread and wine into the actual\r\n“body and blood of Christ.”(94) With blasphemous presumption, they openly\r\nclaimed the power of creating God, the Creator of all things. Christians\r\nwere required, on pain of death, to avow their faith in this horrible,\r\nHeaven-insulting heresy. Multitudes who refused were given to the\r\nflames.(95)\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century was established that most terrible of all the\r\nengines of the papacy,—the Inquisition. The prince of darkness wrought\r\nwith the leaders of the papal hierarchy. In their secret councils, Satan\r\nand his angels controlled the minds of evil men, while unseen in the midst\r\nstood an angel of God, taking the fearful record of their iniquitous\r\ndecrees, and writing the history of deeds too horrible to appear to human\r\neyes. “Babylon the great” was “drunken with the blood of the saints.” The\r\nmangled forms of millions of martyrs cried to God for vengeance upon that\r\napostate power.\r\n\r\nPopery had become the world’s despot. Kings and emperors bowed to the\r\ndecrees of the Roman pontiff. The destinies of men, both for time and for\r\neternity, seemed under his control. For hundreds of years the doctrines of\r\nRome had been extensively and implicitly received, its rites reverently\r\nperformed, its festivals generally observed. Its clergy were honored and\r\nliberally sustained. Never since has the Roman Church attained to greater\r\ndignity, magnificence, or power.\r\n\r\nBut “the noon of the papacy was the midnight of the world.”(96) The Holy\r\nScriptures were almost unknown, not only to the people, but to the\r\npriests. Like the Pharisees of old, the papal leaders hated the light\r\nwhich would reveal their sins. God’s law, the standard of righteousness,\r\nhaving been removed, they exercised power without limit, and practised\r\nvice without restraint. Fraud, avarice, and profligacy prevailed. Men\r\nshrank from no crime by which they could gain wealth or position. The\r\npalaces of popes and prelates were scenes of the vilest debauchery. Some\r\nof the reigning pontiffs were guilty of crimes so revolting that secular\r\nrulers endeavored to depose these dignitaries of the church as monsters\r\ntoo vile to be tolerated. For centuries Europe had made no progress in\r\nlearning, arts, or civilization. A moral and intellectual paralysis had\r\nfallen upon Christendom.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the world under the Romish power presented a fearful and\r\nstriking fulfilment of the words of the prophet Hosea: “My people are\r\ndestroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I\r\nwill also reject thee:... seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I\r\nwill also forget thy children.” “There is no truth, nor mercy, nor\r\nknowledge of God in the land. By swearing, and lying, and killing, and\r\nstealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth\r\nblood.”(97) Such were the results of banishing the word of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. THE WALDENSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nAmid the gloom that settled upon the earth during the long period of papal\r\nsupremacy, the light of truth could not be wholly extinguished. In every\r\nage there were witnesses for God,—men who cherished faith in Christ as the\r\nonly mediator between God and man, who held the Bible as the only rule of\r\nlife, and who hallowed the true Sabbath. How much the world owes to these\r\nmen, posterity will never know. They were branded as heretics, their\r\nmotives impugned, their characters maligned, their writings suppressed,\r\nmisrepresented, or mutilated. Yet they stood firm, and from age to age\r\nmaintained their faith in its purity, as a sacred heritage for the\r\ngenerations to come.\r\n\r\nThe history of God’s people during the ages of darkness that followed upon\r\nRome’s supremacy, is written in heaven, but they have little place in\r\nhuman records. Few traces of their existence can be found, except in the\r\naccusations of their persecutors. It was the policy of Rome to obliterate\r\nevery trace of dissent from her doctrines or decrees. Everything\r\nheretical, whether persons or writings, she sought to destroy. Expressions\r\nof doubt, or questions as to the authority of papal dogmas, were enough to\r\nforfeit the life of rich or poor, high or low. Rome endeavored also to\r\ndestroy every record of her cruelty toward dissenters. Papal councils\r\ndecreed that books and writings containing such records should be\r\ncommitted to the flames. Before the invention of printing, books were few\r\nin number, and in a form not favorable for preservation; therefore there\r\nwas little to prevent the Romanists from carrying out their purpose.\r\n\r\nNo church within the limits of Romish jurisdiction was long left\r\nundisturbed in the enjoyment of freedom of conscience. No sooner had the\r\npapacy obtained power than she stretched out her arms to crush all that\r\nrefused to acknowledge her sway; and one after another, the churches\r\nsubmitted to her dominion.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, primitive Christianity had very early taken root. The\r\ngospel received by the Britons in the first centuries, was then\r\nuncorrupted by Romish apostasy. Persecution from pagan emperors, which\r\nextended even to these far-off shores, was the only gift that the first\r\nchurches of Britain received from Rome. Many of the Christians, fleeing\r\nfrom persecution in England, found refuge in Scotland; thence the truth\r\nwas carried to Ireland, and in all these countries it was received with\r\ngladness.\r\n\r\nWhen the Saxons invaded Britain, heathenism gained control. The conquerors\r\ndisdained to be instructed by their slaves, and the Christians were forced\r\nto retreat to the mountains and the wild moors. Yet the light, hidden for\r\na time, continued to burn. In Scotland, a century later, it shone out with\r\na brightness that extended to far-distant lands. From Ireland came the\r\npious Columba and his co-laborers, who, gathering about them the scattered\r\nbelievers on the lonely island of Iona, made this the center of their\r\nmissionary labors. Among these evangelists was an observer of the Bible\r\nSabbath, and thus this truth was introduced among the people. A school was\r\nestablished at Iona, from which missionaries went out, not only to\r\nScotland and England, but to Germany, Switzerland, and even Italy.\r\n\r\nBut Rome had fixed her eyes on Britain, and resolved to bring it under her\r\nsupremacy. In the sixth century her missionaries undertook the conversion\r\nof the heathen Saxons. They were received with favor by the proud\r\nbarbarians, and they induced many thousands to profess the Romish faith.\r\nAs the work progressed, the papal leaders and their converts encountered\r\nthe primitive Christians. A striking contrast was presented. The latter\r\nwere simple, humble, and scriptural in character, doctrine, and manners,\r\nwhile the former manifested the superstition, pomp, and arrogance of\r\npopery. The emissary of Rome demanded that these Christian churches\r\nacknowledge the supremacy of the sovereign pontiff. The Britons meekly\r\nreplied that they desired to love all men, but that the pope was not\r\nentitled to supremacy in the church, and they could render to him only\r\nthat submission which was due to every follower of Christ. Repeated\r\nattempts were made to secure their allegiance to Rome; but these humble\r\nChristians, amazed at the pride displayed by her emissaries, steadfastly\r\nreplied that they knew no other master than Christ. Now the true spirit of\r\nthe papacy was revealed. Said the Romish leader: “If you will not receive\r\nbrethren who bring you peace, you shall receive enemies who will bring you\r\nwar. If you will not unite with us in showing the Saxons the way of life,\r\nyou shall receive from them the stroke of death.”(98) These were no idle\r\nthreats. War, intrigue, and deception were employed against these\r\nwitnesses for a Bible faith, until the churches of Britain were destroyed,\r\nor forced to submit to the authority of the pope.\r\n\r\nIn lands beyond the jurisdiction of Rome, there existed for many centuries\r\nbodies of Christians who remained almost wholly free from papal\r\ncorruption. They were surrounded by heathenism, and in the lapse of ages\r\nwere affected by its errors; but they continued to regard the Bible as the\r\nonly rule of faith, and adhered to many of its truths. These Christians\r\nbelieved in the perpetuity of the law of God, and observed the Sabbath of\r\nthe fourth commandment. Churches that held to this faith and practice,\r\nexisted in Central Africa and among the Armenians of Asia.\r\n\r\nBut of those who resisted the encroachments of the papal power, the\r\nWaldenses stood foremost. In the very land where popery had fixed its\r\nseat, there its falsehood and corruption were most steadfastly resisted.\r\nFor centuries the churches of Piedmont maintained their independence; but\r\nthe time came at last when Rome insisted upon their submission. After\r\nineffectual struggles against her tyranny, the leaders of these churches\r\nreluctantly acknowledged the supremacy of the power to which the whole\r\nworld seemed to pay homage. There were some, however, who refused to yield\r\nto the authority of pope or prelate. They were determined to maintain\r\ntheir allegiance to God, and to preserve the purity and simplicity of\r\ntheir faith. A separation took place. Those who adhered to the ancient\r\nfaith now withdrew; some, forsaking their native Alps, raised the banner\r\nof truth in foreign lands; others retreated to the secluded glens and\r\nrocky fastnesses of the mountains, and there preserved their freedom to\r\nworship God.\r\n\r\nThe faith which for many centuries was held and taught by the Waldensian\r\nChristians, was in marked contrast to the false doctrines put forth from\r\nRome. Their religious belief was founded upon the written word of God, the\r\ntrue system of Christianity. But those humble peasants, in their obscure\r\nretreats, shut away from the world, and bound to daily toil among their\r\nflocks and their vineyards, had not by themselves arrived at the truth in\r\nopposition to the dogmas and heresies of the apostate church. Theirs was\r\nnot a faith newly received. Their religious belief was their inheritance\r\nfrom their fathers. They contended for the faith of the apostolic\r\nchurch,—“the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.”(99) “The\r\nchurch in the wilderness,” and not the proud hierarchy enthroned in the\r\nworld’s great capital, was the true church of Christ, the guardian of the\r\ntreasures of truth which God has committed to His people to be given to\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nAmong the leading causes that had led to the separation of the true church\r\nfrom Rome, was the hatred of the latter toward the Bible Sabbath. As\r\nforetold by prophecy, the papal power cast down the truth to the ground.\r\nThe law of God was trampled in the dust, while the traditions and customs\r\nof men were exalted. The churches that were under the rule of the papacy\r\nwere early compelled to honor the Sunday as a holy day. Amid the\r\nprevailing error and superstition, many, even of the true people of God,\r\nbecame so bewildered that while they observed the Sabbath, they refrained\r\nfrom labor also on the Sunday. But this did not satisfy the papal leaders.\r\nThey demanded not only that Sunday be hallowed, but that the Sabbath be\r\nprofaned; and they denounced in the strongest language those who dared to\r\nshow it honor. It was only by fleeing from the power of Rome that any\r\ncould obey God’s law in peace.\r\n\r\nThe Waldenses were among the first of the peoples of Europe to obtain a\r\ntranslation of the Holy Scriptures.(100) Hundreds of years before the\r\nReformation, they possessed the Bible in manuscript in their native\r\ntongue. They had the truth unadulterated, and this rendered them the\r\nspecial objects of hatred and persecution. They declared the Church of\r\nRome to be the apostate Babylon of the Apocalypse, and at the peril of\r\ntheir lives they stood up to resist her corruptions. While, under the\r\npressure of long-continued persecution, some compromised their faith,\r\nlittle by little yielding its distinctive principles, others held fast the\r\ntruth. Through ages of darkness and apostasy, there were Waldenses who\r\ndenied the supremacy of Rome, who rejected image worship as idolatry, and\r\nwho kept the true Sabbath. Under the fiercest tempests of opposition they\r\nmaintained their faith. Though gashed by the Savoyard spear, and scorched\r\nby the Romish fagot, they stood unflinchingly for God’s word and His\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\nBehind the lofty bulwarks of the mountains,—in all ages the refuge of the\r\npersecuted and oppressed,—the Waldenses found a hiding-place. Here the\r\nlight of truth was kept burning amid the darkness of the Middle Ages.\r\nHere, for a thousand years, witnesses for the truth maintained the ancient\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nGod had provided for His people a sanctuary of awful grandeur, befitting\r\nthe mighty truths committed to their trust. To those faithful exiles the\r\nmountains were an emblem of the immutable righteousness of Jehovah. They\r\npointed their children to the heights towering above them in unchanging\r\nmajesty, and spoke to them of Him with whom there is no variableness nor\r\nshadow of turning, whose word is as enduring as the everlasting hills. God\r\nhad set fast the mountains, and girded them with strength; no arm but that\r\nof Infinite Power could move them out of their place. In like manner He\r\nhad established His law, the foundation of His government in heaven and\r\nupon earth. The arm of man might reach his fellow-men and destroy their\r\nlives; but that arm could as readily uproot the mountains from their\r\nfoundations, and hurl them into the sea, as it could change one precept of\r\nthe law of Jehovah, or blot out one of His promises to those who do His\r\nwill. In their fidelity to His law, God’s servants should be as firm as\r\nthe unchanging hills.\r\n\r\nThe mountains that girded their lowly valleys were a constant witness to\r\nGod’s creative power, and a never-failing assurance of His protecting\r\ncare. Those pilgrims learned to love the silent symbols of Jehovah’s\r\npresence. They indulged no repining because of the hardships of their lot;\r\nthey were never lonely amid the mountain solitudes. They thanked God that\r\nHe had provided for them an asylum from the wrath and cruelty of men. They\r\nrejoiced in their freedom to worship before Him. Often when pursued by\r\ntheir enemies, the strength of the hills proved a sure defense. From many\r\na lofty cliff they chanted the praise of God, and the armies of Rome could\r\nnot silence their songs of thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nPure, simple, and fervent was the piety of these followers of Christ. The\r\nprinciples of truth they valued above houses and lands, friends, kindred,\r\neven life itself. These principles they earnestly sought to impress upon\r\nthe hearts of the young. From earliest childhood the youth were instructed\r\nin the Scriptures, and taught to regard sacredly the claims of the law of\r\nGod. Copies of the Bible were rare; therefore its precious words were\r\ncommitted to memory. Many were able to repeat large portions of both the\r\nOld and the New Testament. Thoughts of God were associated alike with the\r\nsublime scenery of nature and with the humble blessings of daily life.\r\nLittle children learned to look with gratitude to God as the giver of\r\nevery favor and every comfort.\r\n\r\nParents, tender and affectionate as they were, loved their children too\r\nwisely to accustom them to self-indulgence. Before them was a life of\r\ntrial and hardship, perhaps a martyr’s death. They were educated from\r\nchildhood to endure hardness, to submit to control, and yet to think and\r\nact for themselves. Very early they were taught to bear responsibilities,\r\nto be guarded in speech, and to understand the wisdom of silence. One\r\nindiscreet word let fall in the hearing of their enemies, might imperil\r\nnot only the life of the speaker, but the lives of hundreds of his\r\nbrethren; for as wolves hunting their prey did the enemies of truth pursue\r\nthose who dared to claim freedom of religious faith.\r\n\r\nThe Waldenses had sacrificed their worldly prosperity for the truth’s\r\nsake, and with persevering patience they toiled for their bread. Every\r\nspot of tillable land among the mountains was carefully improved; the\r\nvalleys and the less fertile hillsides were made to yield their increase.\r\nEconomy and severe self-denial formed a part of the education which the\r\nchildren received as their only legacy. They were taught that God designs\r\nlife to be a discipline, and that their wants could be supplied only by\r\npersonal labor, by forethought, care, and faith. The process was laborious\r\nand wearisome, but it was wholesome, just what man needs in his fallen\r\nstate, the school which God has provided for his training and development.\r\nWhile the youth were inured to toil and hardship, the culture of the\r\nintellect was not neglected. They were taught that all their powers\r\nbelonged to God, and that all were to be improved and developed for His\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe Vaudois churches, in their purity and simplicity, resembled the church\r\nof apostolic times. Rejecting the supremacy of pope and prelate, they held\r\nthe Bible as the only supreme, infallible authority. Their pastors, unlike\r\nthe lordly priests of Rome, followed the example of their Master, who\r\n“came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.” They fed the flock of\r\nGod, leading them to the green pastures and living fountains of His holy\r\nword. Far from the monuments of human pomp and pride, the people\r\nassembled, not in magnificent churches or grand cathedrals, but beneath\r\nthe shadow of the mountains, in the Alpine valleys, or, in time of danger,\r\nin some rocky stronghold, to listen to the words of truth from the\r\nservants of Christ. The pastors not only preached the gospel, but they\r\nvisited the sick, catechized the children, admonished the erring, and\r\nlabored to settle disputes and promote harmony and brotherly love. In\r\ntimes of peace they were sustained by the freewill offerings of the\r\npeople; but, like Paul the tent-maker, each learned some trade or\r\nprofession by which, if necessary, to provide for his own support.\r\n\r\nFrom their pastors the youth received instruction. While attention was\r\ngiven to branches of general learning, the Bible was made the chief study.\r\nThe Gospels of Matthew and John were committed to memory, with many of the\r\nEpistles. They were employed also in copying the Scriptures. Some\r\nmanuscripts contained the whole Bible, others only brief selections, to\r\nwhich some simple explanations of the text were added by those who were\r\nable to expound the Scriptures. Thus were brought forth the treasures of\r\ntruth so long concealed by those who sought to exalt themselves above God.\r\n\r\nBy patient, untiring labor, sometimes in the deep, dark caverns of the\r\nearth, by the light of torches, the sacred Scriptures were written out,\r\nverse by verse, chapter by chapter. Thus the work went on, the revealed\r\nwill of God shining out like pure gold; how much brighter, clearer, and\r\nmore powerful because of the trials undergone for its sake, only those\r\ncould realize who were engaged in the work. Angels from heaven surrounded\r\nthese faithful workers.\r\n\r\nSatan had urged on the papal priests and prelates to bury the Word of\r\ntruth beneath the rubbish of error, heresy, and superstition; but in a\r\nmost wonderful manner it was preserved uncorrupted through all the ages of\r\ndarkness. It bore not the stamp of man, but the impress of God. Men have\r\nbeen unwearied in their efforts to obscure the plain, simple meaning of\r\nthe Scriptures, and to make them contradict their own testimony; but like\r\nthe ark upon the billowy deep, the word of God outrides the storms that\r\nthreaten it with destruction. As the mine has rich veins of gold and\r\nsilver hidden beneath the surface, so that all must dig who would discover\r\nits precious stores, so the Holy Scriptures have treasures of truth that\r\nare revealed only to the earnest, humble, prayerful seeker. God designed\r\nthe Bible to be a lesson-book to all mankind, in childhood, youth, and\r\nmanhood, and to be studied through all time. He gave His word to men as a\r\nrevelation of Himself. Every new truth discerned is a fresh disclosure of\r\nthe character of its Author. The study of the Scriptures is the means\r\ndivinely ordained to bring men into closer connection with their Creator,\r\nand to give them a clearer knowledge of His will. It is the medium of\r\ncommunication between God and man.\r\n\r\nWhile the Waldenses regarded the fear of the Lord as the beginning of\r\nwisdom, they were not blind to the importance of a contact with the world,\r\na knowledge of men and of active life, in expanding the mind and\r\nquickening the perceptions. From their schools in the mountains some of\r\nthe youth were sent to institutions of learning in the cities of France or\r\nItaly, where was a more extended field for study, thought, and observation\r\nthan in their native Alps. The youth thus sent forth were exposed to\r\ntemptation, they witnessed vice, they encountered Satan’s wily agents, who\r\nurged upon them the most subtle heresies and the most dangerous\r\ndeceptions. But their education from childhood had been of a character to\r\nprepare them for all this.\r\n\r\nIn the schools whither they went, they were not to make confidants of any.\r\nTheir garments were so prepared as to conceal their greatest treasure,—the\r\nprecious manuscripts of the Scriptures. These, the fruit of months and\r\nyears of toil, they carried with them, and whenever they could do so\r\nwithout exciting suspicion, they cautiously placed some portion in the way\r\nof those whose hearts seemed open to receive the truth. From their\r\nmother’s knee the Waldensian youth had been trained with this purpose in\r\nview; they understood their work, and faithfully performed it. Converts to\r\nthe true faith were won in these institutions of learning, and frequently\r\nits principles were found to be permeating the entire school; yet the\r\npapal leaders could not, by the closest inquiry, trace the so-called\r\ncorrupting heresy to its source.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of Christ is a missionary spirit. The very first impulse of the\r\nrenewed heart is to bring others also to the Saviour. Such was the spirit\r\nof the Vaudois Christians. They felt that God required more of them than\r\nmerely to preserve the truth in its purity in their own churches; that a\r\nsolemn responsibility rested upon them to let their light shine forth to\r\nthose who were in darkness; by the mighty power of God’s word they sought\r\nto break the bondage which Rome had imposed. The Vaudois ministers were\r\ntrained as missionaries, every one who expected to enter the ministry\r\nbeing required first to gain an experience as an evangelist. Each was to\r\nserve three years in some mission field before taking charge of a church\r\nat home. This service, requiring at the outset self-denial and sacrifice,\r\nwas a fitting introduction to the pastor’s life in those times that tried\r\nmen’s souls. The youth who received ordination to the sacred office saw\r\nbefore them, not the prospect of earthly wealth and glory, but a life of\r\ntoil and danger, and possibly a martyr’s fate. The missionaries went out\r\ntwo and two, as Jesus sent forth His disciples. With each young man was\r\nusually associated a man of age and experience, the youth being under the\r\nguidance of his companion, who was held responsible for his training, and\r\nwhose instruction he was required to heed. These co-laborers were not\r\nalways together, but often met for prayer and counsel, thus strengthening\r\neach other in the faith.\r\n\r\nTo have made known the object of their mission would have insured its\r\ndefeat; therefore they carefully concealed their real character. Every\r\nminister possessed a knowledge of some trade or profession, and the\r\nmissionaries prosecuted their work under cover of a secular calling.\r\nUsually they chose that of merchant or peddler. “They carried silks,\r\njewelry, and other articles, at that time not easily purchasable save at\r\ndistant marts; and they were welcomed as merchants where they would have\r\nbeen spurned as missionaries.”(101) All the while their hearts were\r\nuplifted to God for wisdom to present a treasure more precious than gold\r\nor gems. They secretly carried about with them copies of the Bible, in\r\nwhole or in part; and whenever an opportunity was presented, they called\r\nthe attention of their customers to these manuscripts. Often an interest\r\nto read God’s word was thus awakened, and some portion was gladly left\r\nwith those who desired to receive it.\r\n\r\nThe work of these missionaries began in the plains and valleys at the foot\r\nof their own mountains, but it extended far beyond these limits. With\r\nnaked feet and in garments coarse and travel-stained as were those of\r\ntheir Master, they passed through great cities, and penetrated to distant\r\nlands. Everywhere they scattered the precious seed. Churches sprung up in\r\ntheir path, and the blood of martyrs witnessed for the truth. The day of\r\nGod will reveal a rich harvest of souls garnered by the labors of these\r\nfaithful men. Veiled and silent, the word of God was making its way\r\nthrough Christendom, and meeting a glad reception in the homes and hearts\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nTo the Waldenses the Scriptures were not merely a record of God’s dealings\r\nwith men in the past, and a revelation of the responsibilities and duties\r\nof the present, but an unfolding of the perils and glories of the future.\r\nThey believed that the end of all things was not far distant; and as they\r\nstudied the Bible with prayer and tears, they were the more deeply\r\nimpressed with its precious utterances, and with their duty to make known\r\nto others its saving truths. They saw the plan of salvation clearly\r\nrevealed in the sacred pages, and they found comfort, hope, and peace in\r\nbelieving in Jesus. As the light illuminated their understanding and made\r\nglad their hearts, they longed to shed its beams upon those who were in\r\nthe darkness of papal error.\r\n\r\nThey saw that under the guidance of pope and priests, multitudes were\r\nvainly endeavoring to obtain pardon by afflicting their bodies for the sin\r\nof their souls. Taught to trust to their good works to save them, they\r\nwere ever looking to themselves, their minds dwelling upon their sinful\r\ncondition, seeing themselves exposed to the wrath of God, afflicting soul\r\nand body, yet finding no relief. Thus conscientious souls were bound by\r\nthe doctrines of Rome. Thousands abandoned friends and kindred, and spent\r\ntheir lives in convent cells. By oft-repeated fasts and cruel scourgings,\r\nby midnight vigils, by prostration for weary hours upon the cold, damp\r\nstones of their dreary abode, by long pilgrimages, by humiliating penance\r\nand fearful torture, thousands vainly sought to obtain peace of\r\nconscience. Oppressed with a sense of sin, and haunted with the fear of\r\nGod’s avenging wrath, many suffered on, until exhausted nature gave way,\r\nand without one ray of light or hope, they sank into the tomb.\r\n\r\nThe Waldenses longed to break to these starving souls the bread of life,\r\nto open to them the messages of peace in the promises of God, and to point\r\nthem to Christ as their only hope of salvation. The doctrine that good\r\nworks can atone for the transgression of God’s law, they held to be based\r\nupon falsehood. Reliance upon human merit intercepts the view of Christ’s\r\ninfinite love. Jesus died as a sacrifice for man because the fallen race\r\ncan do nothing to recommend themselves to God. The merits of a crucified\r\nand risen Saviour are the foundation of the Christian’s faith. The\r\ndependence of the soul upon Christ is as real, and its connection with Him\r\nmust be as close, as that of a limb to the body, or of a branch to the\r\nvine.\r\n\r\nThe teachings of popes and priests had led men to look upon the character\r\nof God, and even of Christ, as stern, gloomy, and forbidding. The Saviour\r\nwas represented as so far devoid of sympathy with man in his fallen state\r\nthat the mediation of priests and saints must be invoked. Those whose\r\nminds had been enlightened by the word of God longed to point these souls\r\nto Jesus as their compassionate, loving Saviour, standing with\r\noutstretched arms, inviting all to come to Him with their burden of sin,\r\ntheir care and weariness. They longed to clear away the obstructions which\r\nSatan had piled up that men might not see the promises, and come directly\r\nto God, confessing their sins, and obtaining pardon and peace.\r\n\r\nEagerly did the Vaudois missionary unfold to the inquiring mind the\r\nprecious truths of the gospel. Cautiously he produced the carefully\r\nwritten portions of the Holy Scriptures. It was his greatest joy to give\r\nhope to the conscientious, sin-stricken soul, who could see only a God of\r\nvengeance, waiting to execute justice. With quivering lip and tearful eye\r\ndid he, often on bended knees, open to his brethren the precious promises\r\nthat reveal the sinner’s only hope. Thus the light of truth penetrated\r\nmany a darkened mind, rolling back the cloud of gloom, until the Sun of\r\nRighteousness shone into the heart with healing in His beams. It was often\r\nthe case that some portion of Scripture was read again and again, the\r\nhearer desiring it to be repeated, as if he would assure himself that he\r\nhad heard aright. Especially was the repetition of these words eagerly\r\ndesired: “The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all\r\nsin.”(102) “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must\r\nthe Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in Him should not\r\nperish, but have eternal life.”(103)\r\n\r\nMany were undeceived in regard to the claims of Rome. They saw how vain is\r\nthe mediation of men or angels in behalf of the sinner. As the true light\r\ndawned upon their minds, they exclaimed with rejoicing, “Christ is my\r\npriest; His blood is my sacrifice; His altar is my confessional.” They\r\ncast themselves wholly upon the merits of Jesus, repeating the words,\r\n“Without faith it is impossible to please Him.”(104) “There is none other\r\nname under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”(105)\r\n\r\nThe assurance of a Saviour’s love seemed too much for some of these poor\r\ntempest-tossed souls to realize. So great was the relief which it brought,\r\nsuch a flood of light was shed upon them, that they seemed transported to\r\nheaven. Their hands were laid confidingly in the hand of Christ; their\r\nfeet were planted upon the Rock of Ages. All fear of death was banished.\r\nThey could now covet the prison and the fagot if they might thereby honor\r\nthe name of their Redeemer.\r\n\r\nIn secret places the word of God was thus brought forth and read,\r\nsometimes to a single soul, sometimes to a little company who were longing\r\nfor light and truth. Often the entire night was spent in this manner. So\r\ngreat would be the wonder and admiration of the listeners that the\r\nmessenger of mercy was not infrequently compelled to cease his reading\r\nuntil the understanding could grasp the tidings of salvation. Often would\r\nwords like these be uttered: “Will God indeed accept _my_ offering? Will\r\nHe smile upon _me_? Will He pardon _me_?” The answer was read, “Come unto\r\nMe, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”(106)\r\n\r\nFaith grasped the promise, and the glad response was heard: “No more long\r\npilgrimages to make; no more painful journeys to holy shrines. I may come\r\nto Jesus just as I am, sinful and unholy, and He will not spurn the\r\npenitential prayer. ‘Thy sins be forgiven thee.’ Mine, even mine, may be\r\nforgiven!”\r\n\r\nA tide of sacred joy would fill the heart, and the name of Jesus would be\r\nmagnified by praise and thanksgiving. Those happy souls returned to their\r\nhomes to diffuse light, to repeat to others, as well as they could, their\r\nnew experience; that they had found the true and living Way. There was a\r\nstrange and solemn power in the words of Scripture that spoke directly to\r\nthe hearts of those who were longing for the truth. It was the voice of\r\nGod, and it carried conviction to those who heard.\r\n\r\nThe messenger of truth went on his way; but his appearance of humility,\r\nhis sincerity, his earnestness and deep fervor, were subjects of frequent\r\nremark. In many instances his hearers had not asked him whence he came or\r\nwhither he went. They had been so overwhelmed, at first with surprise, and\r\nafterward with gratitude and joy, that they had not thought to question\r\nhim. When they had urged him to accompany them to their homes, he had\r\nreplied that he must visit the lost sheep of the flock. Could he have been\r\nan angel from heaven? they queried.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the messenger of truth was seen no more. He had made his way\r\nto other lands, or he was wearing out his life in some unknown dungeon, or\r\nperhaps his bones were whitening on the spot where he had witnessed for\r\nthe truth. But the words he had left behind could not be destroyed. They\r\nwere doing their work in the hearts of men; the blessed results will be\r\nfully known only in the judgment.\r\n\r\nThe Waldensian missionaries were invading the kingdom of Satan, and the\r\npowers of darkness aroused to greater vigilance. Every effort to advance\r\nthe truth was watched by the prince of evil, and he excited the fears of\r\nhis agents. The papal leaders saw a portent of danger to their cause from\r\nthe labors of these humble itinerants. If the light of truth were allowed\r\nto shine unobstructed, it would sweep away the heavy clouds of error that\r\nenveloped the people; it would direct the minds of men to God alone, and\r\nwould eventually destroy the supremacy of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe very existence of this people, holding the faith of the ancient\r\nchurch, was a constant testimony to Rome’s apostasy, and therefore excited\r\nthe most bitter hatred and persecution. Their refusal to surrender the\r\nScriptures was also an offense that Rome could not tolerate. She\r\ndetermined to blot them from the earth. Now began the most terrible\r\ncrusades against God’s people in their mountain homes. Inquisitors were\r\nput upon their track, and the scene of innocent Abel falling before the\r\nmurderous Cain was often repeated.\r\n\r\nAgain and again were their fertile lands laid waste, their dwellings and\r\nchapels swept away, so that where once were flourishing fields and the\r\nhomes of an innocent, industrious people, there remained only a desert. As\r\nthe ravenous beast is rendered more furious by the taste of blood, so the\r\nrage of the papists was kindled to greater intensity by the sufferings of\r\ntheir victims. Many of these witnesses for a pure faith were pursued\r\nacross the mountains, and hunted down in the valleys where they were\r\nhidden, shut in by mighty forests and pinnacles of rock.\r\n\r\nNo charge could be brought against the moral character of this proscribed\r\nclass. Even their enemies declared them to be a peaceable, quiet, pious\r\npeople. Their grand offense was that they would not worship God according\r\nto the will of the pope. For this crime, every humiliation, insult, and\r\ntorture that men or devils could invent was heaped upon them.\r\n\r\nWhen Rome at one time determined to exterminate the hated sect, a bull was\r\nissued by the pope, condemning them as heretics, and delivering them to\r\nslaughter.(107) They were not accused as idlers, or dishonest, or\r\ndisorderly; but it was declared that they had an appearance of piety and\r\nsanctity that seduced “the sheep of the true fold.” Therefore the pope\r\nordered “that malicious and abominable sect of malignants,” if they\r\n“refuse to abjure, to be crushed like venomous snakes.”(108) Did this\r\nhaughty potentate expect to meet those words again? Did he know that they\r\nwere registered in the books of heaven, to confront him at the judgment?\r\n“Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren,”\r\nsaid Jesus, “ye have done it unto Me.”(109)\r\n\r\nThis bull called upon all members of the church to join the crusade\r\nagainst the heretics. As an incentive to engage in this cruel work, it\r\n“absolved from all ecclesiastical pains and penalties, general and\r\nparticular; it released all who joined the crusade from any oaths they\r\nmight have taken; it legitimatized their title to any property they might\r\nhave illegally acquired; and promised remission of all their sins to such\r\nas should kill any heretic. It annulled all contracts made in favor of\r\nVaudois, ordered their domestics to abandon them, forbade all persons to\r\ngive them any aid whatever, and empowered all persons to take possession\r\nof their property.” This document clearly reveals the master-spirit behind\r\nthe scenes. It is the roar of the dragon, and not the voice of Christ,\r\nthat is heard therein.\r\n\r\nThe papal leaders would not conform their characters to the great standard\r\nof God’s law, but erected a standard to suit themselves, and determined to\r\ncompel all to conform to this because Rome willed it. The most horrible\r\ntragedies were enacted. Corrupt and blasphemous priests and popes were\r\ndoing the work which Satan appointed them. Mercy had no place in their\r\nnatures. The same spirit that crucified Christ and slew the apostles, the\r\nsame that moved the bloodthirsty Nero against the faithful in his day, was\r\nat work to rid the earth of those who were beloved of God.\r\n\r\nThe persecutions visited for many centuries upon this God-fearing people\r\nwere endured by them with a patience and constancy that honored their\r\nRedeemer. Notwithstanding the crusades against them, and the inhuman\r\nbutchery to which they were subjected, they continued to send out their\r\nmissionaries to scatter the precious truth. They were hunted to the death;\r\nyet their blood watered the seed sown, and it failed not of yielding\r\nfruit. Thus the Waldenses witnessed for God, centuries before the birth of\r\nLuther. Scattered over many lands, they planted the seeds of the\r\nReformation that began in the time of Wycliffe, grew broad and deep in the\r\ndays of Luther, and is to be carried forward to the close of time by those\r\nwho also are willing to suffer all things for “the word of God, and for\r\nthe testimony of Jesus Christ.”(110)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. JOHN WYCLIFFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nBefore the Reformation, there were at times but very few copies of the\r\nBible in existence; but God had not suffered His word to be wholly\r\ndestroyed. Its truths were not to be forever hidden. He could as easily\r\nunchain the words of life as He could open prison doors and unbolt iron\r\ngates to set His servants free. In the different countries of Europe men\r\nwere moved by the Spirit of God to search for the truth as for hid\r\ntreasures. Providentially guided to the Holy Scriptures, they studied the\r\nsacred pages with intense interest. They were willing to accept the light,\r\nat any cost to themselves. Though they did not see all things clearly,\r\nthey were enabled to perceive many long-buried truths. As Heaven-sent\r\nmessengers they went forth, rending asunder the chains of error and\r\nsuperstition, and calling upon those who had been so long enslaved, to\r\narise and assert their liberty.\r\n\r\nExcept among the Waldenses, the word of God had for ages been locked up in\r\nlanguages known only to the learned; but the time had come for the\r\nScriptures to be translated, and given to the people of different lands in\r\ntheir native tongue. The world had passed its midnight. The hours of\r\ndarkness were wearing away, and in many lands appeared tokens of the\r\ncoming dawn.\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century arose in England the “morning star of the\r\nReformation.” John Wycliffe was the herald of reform, not for England\r\nalone, but for all Christendom. The great protest against Rome which it\r\nwas permitted him to utter, was never to be silenced. That protest opened\r\nthe struggle which was to result in the emancipation of individuals, of\r\nchurches, and of nations.\r\n\r\nWycliffe received a liberal education, and with him the fear of the Lord\r\nwas the beginning of wisdom. He was noted at college for his fervent piety\r\nas well as for his remarkable talents and sound scholarship. In his thirst\r\nfor knowledge he sought to become acquainted with every branch of\r\nlearning. He was educated in the scholastic philosophy, in the canons of\r\nthe church, and in the civil law, especially that of his own country. In\r\nhis after-labors the value of this early training was apparent. A thorough\r\nacquaintance with the speculative philosophy of his time enabled him to\r\nexpose its errors; and by his study of national and ecclesiastical law he\r\nwas prepared to engage in the great struggle for civil and religious\r\nliberty. While he could wield the weapons drawn from the word of God, he\r\nhad acquired the intellectual discipline of the schools, and he understood\r\nthe tactics of the schoolmen. The power of his genius and the extent and\r\nthoroughness of his knowledge commanded the respect of both friends and\r\nfoes. His adherents saw with satisfaction that their champion stood\r\nforemost among the leading minds of the nation; and his enemies were\r\nprevented from casting contempt upon the cause of reform by exposing the\r\nignorance or weakness of its supporter.\r\n\r\nWhile Wycliffe was still at college, he entered upon the study of the\r\nScriptures. In those early times, when the Bible existed only in the\r\nancient languages, scholars were enabled to find their way to the fountain\r\nof truth, which was closed to the uneducated classes. Thus already the way\r\nhad been prepared for Wycliffe’s future work as a Reformer.\r\n\r\nMen of learning had studied the word of God, and had found the great truth\r\nof His free grace there revealed. In their teachings they had spread a\r\nknowledge of this truth, and had led others to turn to the Living Oracles.\r\n\r\nWhen Wycliffe’s attention was directed to the Scriptures, he entered upon\r\ntheir investigation with the same thoroughness which had enabled him to\r\nmaster the learning of the schools. Heretofore he had felt a great want,\r\nwhich neither his scholastic studies nor the teaching of the church could\r\nsatisfy. In the word of God he found that which he had before sought in\r\nvain. Here he saw the plan of salvation revealed, and Christ set forth as\r\nthe only advocate for man. He gave himself to the service of Christ, and\r\ndetermined to proclaim the truths he had discovered.\r\n\r\nLike after-reformers, Wycliffe did not, at the opening of his work,\r\nforesee whither it would lead him. He did not set himself deliberately in\r\nopposition to Rome. But devotion to truth could not but bring him in\r\nconflict with falsehood. The more clearly he discerned the errors of the\r\npapacy, the more earnestly he presented the teaching of the Bible. He saw\r\nthat Rome had forsaken the word of God for human tradition; he fearlessly\r\naccused the priesthood of having banished the Scriptures, and demanded\r\nthat the Bible be restored to the people, and that its authority be again\r\nestablished in the church. He was an able and earnest teacher, and an\r\neloquent preacher, and his daily life was a demonstration of the truths he\r\npreached. His knowledge of the Scriptures, the force of his reasoning, the\r\npurity of his life, and his unbending courage and integrity, won for him\r\ngeneral esteem and confidence. Many of the people had become dissatisfied\r\nwith their former faith, as they saw the iniquity that prevailed in the\r\nRoman Church, and they hailed with unconcealed joy the truths brought to\r\nview by Wycliffe; but the papal leaders were filled with rage when they\r\nperceived that this Reformer was gaining an influence greater than their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nWycliffe was a keen detector of error, and he struck fearlessly against\r\nmany of the abuses sanctioned by the authority of Rome. While acting as\r\nchaplain for the king, he took a bold stand against the payment of tribute\r\nclaimed by the pope from the English monarch, and showed that the papal\r\nassumption of authority over secular rulers was contrary to both reason\r\nand revelation. The demands of the pope had excited great indignation, and\r\nWycliffe’s teachings exerted an influence upon the leading minds of the\r\nnation. The king and the nobles united in denying the pontiff’s claim to\r\ntemporal authority, and in refusing the payment of the tribute. Thus an\r\neffectual blow was struck against the papal supremacy in England.\r\n\r\nAnother evil against which the Reformer waged long and resolute battle,\r\nwas the institution of the orders of mendicant friars. These friars\r\nswarmed in England, casting a blight upon the greatness and prosperity of\r\nthe nation. Industry, education, morals, all felt the withering influence.\r\nThe monks’ life of idleness and beggary was not only a heavy drain upon\r\nthe resources of the people, but it brought useful labor into contempt.\r\nThe youth were demoralized and corrupted. By the influence of the friars\r\nmany were induced to enter a cloister and devote themselves to a monastic\r\nlife, and this not only without the consent of their parents, but even\r\nwithout their knowledge, and contrary to their commands. One of the early\r\nFathers of the Roman Church, urging the claims of monasticism above the\r\nobligations of filial love and duty, had declared: “Though thy father\r\nshould lie before thy door, weeping and lamenting, and thy mother should\r\nshow the body that bore thee and the breasts that nursed thee, see that\r\nthou trample them under foot, and go onward straightway to Christ.” By\r\nthis “monstrous inhumanity,” as Luther afterward styled it, “savoring more\r\nof the wolf and the tyrant than of the Christian and the man,” were the\r\nhearts of children steeled against their parents.(111) Thus did the papal\r\nleaders, like the Pharisees of old, make the commandment of God of none\r\neffect by their tradition. Thus homes were made desolate, and parents were\r\ndeprived of the society of their sons and daughters.\r\n\r\nEven the students in the universities were deceived by the false\r\nrepresentations of the monks, and induced to join their orders. Many\r\nafterward repented this step, seeing that they had blighted their own\r\nlives, and had brought sorrow upon their parents; but once fast in the\r\nsnare, it was impossible for them to obtain their freedom. Many parents,\r\nfearing the influence of the monks, refused to send their sons to the\r\nuniversities. There was a marked falling off in the number of students in\r\nattendance at the great centers of learning. The schools languished, and\r\nignorance prevailed.\r\n\r\nThe pope had bestowed on these monks the power to hear confessions and to\r\ngrant pardon. This became a source of great evil. Bent on enhancing their\r\ngains, the friars were so ready to grant absolution that criminals of all\r\ndescriptions resorted to them, and as a result, the worst vices rapidly\r\nincreased. The sick and the poor were left to suffer, while the gifts that\r\nshould have relieved their wants went to the monks, who with threats\r\ndemanded the alms of the people, denouncing the impiety of those who\r\nshould withhold gifts from their orders. Notwithstanding their profession\r\nof poverty, the wealth of the friars was constantly increasing, and their\r\nmagnificent edifices and luxurious tables made more apparent the growing\r\npoverty of the nation. And while spending their time in luxury and\r\npleasure, they sent out in their stead ignorant men, who could only\r\nrecount marvelous tales, legends, and jests to amuse the people, and make\r\nthem still more completely the dupes of the monks. Yet the friars\r\ncontinued to maintain their hold on the superstitious multitudes, and led\r\nthem to believe that all religious duty was comprised in acknowledging the\r\nsupremacy of the pope, adoring the saints, and making gifts to the monks,\r\nand that this was sufficient to secure them a place in heaven.\r\n\r\nMen of learning and piety had labored in vain to bring about a reform in\r\nthese monastic orders; but Wycliffe, with clearer insight, struck at the\r\nroot of the evil, declaring that the system itself was false, and that it\r\nshould be abolished. Discussion and inquiry were awakening. As the monks\r\ntraversed the country, vending the pope’s pardons, many were led to doubt\r\nthe possibility of purchasing forgiveness with money, and they questioned\r\nwhether they should not seek pardon from God rather than from the pontiff\r\nof Rome.(112) Not a few were alarmed at the rapacity of the friars, whose\r\ngreed seemed never to be satisfied. “The monks and priests of Rome,” said\r\nthey, “are eating us away like a cancer. God must deliver us, or the\r\npeople will perish.”(113) To cover their avarice, these begging monks\r\nclaimed that they were following the Saviour’s example, declaring that\r\nJesus and His disciples had been supported by the charities of the people.\r\nThis claim resulted in injury to their cause, for it led many to the Bible\r\nto learn the truth for themselves,—a result which of all others was least\r\ndesired by Rome. The minds of men were directed to the Source of truth,\r\nwhich it was her object to conceal.\r\n\r\nWycliffe began to write and publish tracts against the friars, not,\r\nhowever, seeking so much to enter into dispute with them as to call the\r\nminds of the people to the teachings of the Bible and its Author. He\r\ndeclared that the power of pardon or of excommunication is possessed by\r\nthe pope in no greater degree than by common priests, and that no man can\r\nbe truly excommunicated unless he has first brought upon himself the\r\ncondemnation of God. In no more effectual way could he have undertaken the\r\noverthrow of that mammoth fabric of spiritual and temporal dominion which\r\nthe pope had erected, and in which the souls and bodies of millions were\r\nheld captive.\r\n\r\nAgain Wycliffe was called to defend the rights of the English crown\r\nagainst the encroachments of Rome; and being appointed a royal ambassador,\r\nhe spent two years in the Netherlands, in conference with the\r\ncommissioners of the pope. Here he was brought into communication with\r\necclesiastics from France, Italy, and Spain, and he had an opportunity to\r\nlook behind the scenes, and gain a knowledge of many things which would\r\nhave remained hidden from him in England. He learned much that was to give\r\npoint to his after-labors. In these representatives from the papal court\r\nhe read the true character and aims of the hierarchy. He returned to\r\nEngland to repeat his former teachings more openly and with greater zeal,\r\ndeclaring that covetousness, pride, and deception were the gods of Rome.\r\n\r\nIn one of his tracts he said, speaking of the pope and his collectors:\r\n“They draw out of our land poor men’s livelihood, and many thousand marks,\r\nby the year, of the king’s money, for sacraments and spiritual things,\r\nthat is cursed heresy of simony, and maketh all Christendom assent and\r\nmaintain this heresy. And certes though our realm had a huge hill of gold,\r\nand never other man took thereof but only this proud worldly priest’s\r\ncollector, by process of time this hill must be spended; for he taketh\r\never money out of our land, and sendeth naught again but God’s curse for\r\nhis simony.”(114)\r\n\r\nSoon after his return to England, Wycliffe received from the king the\r\nappointment to the rectory of Lutterworth. This was an assurance that the\r\nmonarch at least had not been displeased by his plain speaking. Wycliffe’s\r\ninfluence was felt in shaping the action of the court, as well as in\r\nmoulding the belief of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe papal thunders were soon hurled against him. Three bulls were\r\ndispatched to England,—to the university, to the king, and to the\r\nprelates,—all commanding immediate and decisive measures to silence the\r\nteacher of heresy.(115) Before the arrival of the bulls, however, the\r\nbishops, in their zeal, had summoned Wycliffe before them for trial. But\r\ntwo of the most powerful princes in the kingdom accompanied him to the\r\ntribunal; and the people, surrounding the building and rushing in, so\r\nintimidated the judges that the proceedings were for the time suspended,\r\nand he was allowed to go his way in peace. A little later, Edward III.,\r\nwhom in his old age the prelates were seeking to influence against the\r\nReformer, died, and Wycliffe’s former protector became regent of the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nBut the arrival of the papal bulls laid upon all England a peremptory\r\ncommand for the arrest and imprisonment of the heretic. These measures\r\npointed directly to the stake. It appeared certain that Wycliffe must soon\r\nfall a prey to the vengeance of Rome. But He who declared to one of old,\r\n“Fear not: I am thy shield,”(116) again stretched out His hand to protect\r\nHis servant. Death came, not to the Reformer, but to the pontiff who had\r\ndecreed his destruction. Gregory XI. died, and the ecclesiastics who had\r\nassembled for Wycliffe’s trial, dispersed.\r\n\r\nGod’s providence still further overruled events to give opportunity for\r\nthe growth of the Reformation. The death of Gregory was followed by the\r\nelection of two rival popes. Two conflicting powers, each professedly\r\ninfallible, now claimed obedience.(117) Each called upon the faithful to\r\nassist him in making war upon the other, enforcing his demands by terrible\r\nanathemas against his adversaries, and promises of rewards in heaven to\r\nhis supporters. This occurrence greatly weakened the power of the papacy.\r\nThe rival factions had all they could do to attack each other, and\r\nWycliffe for a time had rest. Anathemas and recriminations were flying\r\nfrom pope to pope, and torrents of blood were poured out to support their\r\nconflicting claims. Crimes and scandals flooded the church. Meanwhile the\r\nReformer, in the quiet retirement of his parish of Lutterworth, was\r\nlaboring diligently to point men from the contending popes to Jesus, the\r\nPrince of Peace.\r\n\r\nThe schism, with all the strife and corruption which it caused, prepared\r\nthe way for the Reformation, by enabling the people to see what the papacy\r\nreally was. In a tract which he published, “On the Schism of the Popes,”\r\nWycliffe called upon the people to consider whether these two priests were\r\nnot speaking the truth in condemning each other as the antichrist. “God,”\r\nsaid he, “would no longer suffer the fiend to reign in only one such\r\npriest, but ... made division among two, so that men, in Christ’s name,\r\nmay the more easily overcome them both.”(118)\r\n\r\nWycliffe, like his Master, preached the gospel to the poor. Not content\r\nwith spreading the light in their humble homes in his own parish of\r\nLutterworth, he determined that it should be carried to every part of\r\nEngland. To accomplish this he organized a body of preachers, simple,\r\ndevout men, who loved the truth and desired nothing so much as to extend\r\nit. These men went everywhere, teaching in the market-places, in the\r\nstreets of the great cities, and in the country lanes. They sought out the\r\naged, the sick, and the poor, and opened to them the glad tidings of the\r\ngrace of God.\r\n\r\nAs a professor of theology at Oxford, Wycliffe preached the word of God in\r\nthe halls of the university. So faithfully did he present the truth to the\r\nstudents under his instruction, that he received the title of “The Gospel\r\nDoctor.” But the greatest work of his life was to be the translation of\r\nthe Scriptures into the English language. In a work, “On the Truth and\r\nMeaning of Scripture,” he expressed his intention to translate the Bible,\r\nso that every man in England might read, in the language in which he was\r\nborn, the wonderful works of God.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly his labors were stopped. Though not yet sixty years of age,\r\nunceasing toil, study, and the assaults of his enemies, had told upon his\r\nstrength, and made him prematurely old. He was attacked by a dangerous\r\nillness. The tidings brought great joy to the friars. Now they thought he\r\nwould bitterly repent the evil he had done the church, and they hurried to\r\nhis chamber to listen to his confession. Representatives from the four\r\nreligious orders, with four civil officers, gathered about the supposed\r\ndying man. “You have death on your lips,” they said; “be touched by your\r\nfaults, and retract in our presence all that you have said to our injury.”\r\nThe Reformer listened in silence; then he bade his attendant raise him in\r\nhis bed, and gazing steadily upon them as they stood waiting for his\r\nrecantation, he said, in the firm, strong voice which had so often caused\r\nthem to tremble, “I shall not die, but live, and again declare the evil\r\ndeeds of the friars.”(119) Astonished and abashed, the monks hurried from\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nWycliffe’s words were fulfilled. He lived to place in the hands of his\r\ncountrymen the most powerful of all weapons against Rome,—to give them the\r\nBible, the Heaven-appointed agent to liberate, enlighten, and evangelize\r\nthe people. There were many and great obstacles to surmount in the\r\naccomplishment of this work. Wycliffe was weighed down with infirmities;\r\nhe knew that only a few years for labor remained for him; he saw the\r\nopposition which he must meet; but, encouraged by the promises of God’s\r\nword, he went forward nothing daunted. In the full vigor of his\r\nintellectual powers, rich in experience, he had been preserved and\r\nprepared by God’s special providence for this, the greatest of his labors.\r\nWhile all Christendom was filled with tumult, the Reformer in his rectory\r\nat Lutterworth, unheeding the storm that raged without, applied himself to\r\nhis chosen task.\r\n\r\nAt last the work was completed,—the first English translation of the Bible\r\never made. The word of God was opened to England. The Reformer feared not\r\nnow the prison or the stake. He had placed in the hands of the English\r\npeople a light which should never be extinguished. In giving the Bible to\r\nhis countrymen, he had done more to break the fetters of ignorance and\r\nvice, more to liberate and elevate his country, than was ever achieved by\r\nthe most brilliant victories on fields of battle.\r\n\r\nThe art of printing being still unknown, it was only by slow and wearisome\r\nlabor that copies of the Bible could be multiplied. So great was the\r\ninterest to obtain the book, that many willingly engaged in the work of\r\ntranscribing it, but it was with difficulty that the copyists could supply\r\nthe demand. Some of the more wealthy purchasers desired the whole Bible.\r\nOthers bought only a portion. In many cases, several families united to\r\npurchase a copy. Thus Wycliffe’s Bible soon found its way to the homes of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nThe appeal to men’s reason aroused them from their passive submission to\r\npapal dogmas. Wycliffe now taught the distinctive doctrines of\r\nProtestantism,—salvation through faith in Christ, and the sole\r\ninfallibility of the Scriptures. The preachers whom he had sent out\r\ncirculated the Bible, together with the Reformer’s writings, and with such\r\nsuccess that the new faith was accepted by nearly one half of the people\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the Scriptures brought dismay to the authorities of the\r\nchurch. They had now to meet an agency more powerful than Wycliffe,—an\r\nagency against which their weapons would avail little. There was at this\r\ntime no law in England prohibiting the Bible, for it had never before been\r\npublished in the language of the people. Such laws were afterward enacted\r\nand rigorously enforced. Meanwhile, notwithstanding the efforts of the\r\npriests, there was for a season opportunity for the circulation of the\r\nword of God.\r\n\r\nAgain the papal leaders plotted to silence the Reformer’s voice. Before\r\nthree tribunals he was successively summoned for trial, but without avail.\r\nFirst a synod of bishops declared his writings heretical, and winning the\r\nyoung king, Richard II., to their side, they obtained a royal decree\r\nconsigning to prison all who should hold the condemned doctrines.\r\n\r\nWycliffe appealed from the synod to Parliament; he fearlessly arraigned\r\nthe hierarchy before the national council, and demanded a reform of the\r\nenormous abuses sanctioned by the church. With convincing power he\r\nportrayed the usurpations and corruptions of the papal see. His enemies\r\nwere brought to confusion. The friends and supporters of Wycliffe had been\r\nforced to yield, and it had been confidently expected that the Reformer\r\nhimself, in his old age, alone and friendless, would bow to the combined\r\nauthority of the crown and the mitre. But instead of this the papists saw\r\nthemselves defeated. Parliament, roused by the stirring appeals of\r\nWycliffe, repealed the persecuting edict, and the Reformer was again at\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nA third time he was brought to trial, and now before the highest\r\necclesiastical tribunal in the kingdom. Here no favor would be shown to\r\nheresy. Here at last Rome would triumph, and the Reformer’s work would be\r\nstopped. So thought the papists. If they could but accomplish their\r\npurpose, Wycliffe would be forced to abjure his doctrines, or would leave\r\nthe court only for the flames.\r\n\r\nBut Wycliffe did not retract; he would not dissemble. He fearlessly\r\nmaintained his teachings, and repelled the accusations of his persecutors.\r\nLosing sight of himself, of his position, of the occasion, he summoned his\r\nhearers before the divine tribunal, and weighed their sophistries and\r\ndeceptions in the balances of eternal truth. The power of the Holy Spirit\r\nwas felt in the council-room. A spell from God was upon the hearers. They\r\nseemed to have no power to leave the place. As arrows from the Lord’s\r\nquiver, the Reformer’s words pierced their hearts. The charge of heresy,\r\nwhich they had brought against him, he with convincing power threw back\r\nupon themselves. Why, he demanded, did they dare to spread their errors?\r\nFor the sake of gain, to make merchandise of the grace of God.\r\n\r\n“With whom, think you,” he finally said, “are ye contending? with an old\r\nman on the brink of the grave? No! with Truth,—Truth which is stronger\r\nthan you, and will overcome you.”(120) So saying, he withdrew from the\r\nassembly, and not one of his adversaries attempted to prevent him.\r\n\r\nWycliffe’s work was almost done; the banner of truth which he had so long\r\nborne was soon to fall from his hand; but once more he was to bear witness\r\nfor the gospel. The truth was to be proclaimed from the very stronghold of\r\nthe kingdom of error. Wycliffe was summoned for trial before the papal\r\ntribunal at Rome, which had so often shed the blood of the saints. He was\r\nnot blind to the danger that threatened him, yet he would have obeyed the\r\nsummons had not a shock of palsy made it impossible for him to perform the\r\njourney. But though his voice was not to be heard at Rome, he could speak\r\nby letter, and this he determined to do. From his rectory the Reformer\r\nwrote to the pope a letter, which, while respectful in tone and Christian\r\nin spirit, was a keen rebuke to the pomp and pride of the papal see.\r\n\r\n“Verily I do rejoice,” he said, “to open and declare unto every man the\r\nfaith which I do hold, and especially unto the bishop of Rome: which,\r\nforasmuch as I do suppose to be sound and true, he will most willingly\r\nconfirm my said faith, or if it be erroneous, amend the same.\r\n\r\n“First, I suppose that the gospel of Christ is the whole body of God’s\r\nlaw.... I do give and hold the bishop of Rome, forasmuch as he is the\r\nvicar of Christ here on earth, to be most bound, of all other men, unto\r\nthat law of the gospel. For the greatness among Christ’s disciples did not\r\nconsist in worldly dignity or honors, but in the near and exact following\r\nof Christ in His life and manners.... Christ, for the time of His\r\npilgrimage here, was a most poor man, abjecting and casting off all\r\nworldly rule and honor....\r\n\r\n“No faithful man ought to follow either the pope himself or any of the\r\nholy men, but in such points as he hath followed the Lord Jesus Christ;\r\nfor Peter and the sons of Zebedee, by desiring worldly honor, contrary to\r\nthe following of Christ’s steps, did offend, and therefore in those errors\r\nthey are not to be followed....\r\n\r\n“The pope ought to leave unto the secular power all temporal dominion and\r\nrule, and thereunto effectually to move and exhort his whole clergy; for\r\nso did Christ, and especially by His apostles. Wherefore, if I have erred\r\nin any of these points, I will most humbly submit myself unto correction,\r\neven by death, if necessity so require; and if I could labor according to\r\nmy will or desire in mine own person, I would surely present myself before\r\nthe bishop of Rome; but the Lord hath otherwise visited me to the\r\ncontrary, and hath taught me rather to obey God than men.”\r\n\r\nIn closing he said: “Let us pray unto our God, that He will so stir up our\r\npope Urban VI., as he began, that he with his clergy may follow the Lord\r\nJesus Christ in life and manners; and that they may teach the people\r\neffectually, and that they, likewise, may faithfully follow them in the\r\nsame.”(121)\r\n\r\nThus Wycliffe presented to the pope and his cardinals the meekness and\r\nhumility of Christ, exhibiting not only to themselves but to all\r\nChristendom the contrast between them and the Master whose representatives\r\nthey professed to be.\r\n\r\nWycliffe fully expected that his life would be the price of his fidelity.\r\nThe king, the pope, and the bishops were united to accomplish his ruin,\r\nand it seemed certain that a few months at most would bring him to the\r\nstake. But his courage was unshaken. “Why do you talk of seeking the crown\r\nof martyrdom afar?” he said. “Preach the gospel of Christ to haughty\r\nprelates, and martyrdom will not fail you. What! I should live and be\r\nsilent?... Never! Let the blow fall, I await its coming.”(122)\r\n\r\nBut God’s providence still shielded His servant. The man who for a whole\r\nlifetime had stood boldly in defense of the truth, in daily peril of his\r\nlife, was not to fall a victim to the hatred of its foes. Wycliffe had\r\nnever sought to shield himself, but the Lord had been his protector; and\r\nnow, when his enemies felt sure of their prey, God’s hand removed him\r\nbeyond their reach. In his church at Lutterworth, as he was about to\r\ndispense the communion, he fell, stricken with palsy, and in a short time\r\nyielded up his life.\r\n\r\nGod had appointed to Wycliffe his work. He had put the word of truth in\r\nhis mouth, and He set a guard about him that this word might come to the\r\npeople. His life was protected, and his labors were prolonged, until a\r\nfoundation was laid for the great work of the Reformation.\r\n\r\nWycliffe came from the obscurity of the Dark Ages. There were none who\r\nwent before him from whose work he could shape his system of reform.\r\nRaised up like John the Baptist to accomplish a special mission, he was\r\nthe herald of a new era. Yet in the system of truth which he presented\r\nthere was a unity and completeness which Reformers who followed him did\r\nnot exceed, and which some did not reach, even a hundred years later. So\r\nbroad and deep was laid the foundation, so firm and true was the\r\nframework, that it needed not to be reconstructed by those who came after\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe great movement that Wycliffe inaugurated, which was to liberate the\r\nconscience and the intellect, and set free the nations so long bound to\r\nthe triumphal car of Rome, had its spring in the Bible. Here was the\r\nsource of that stream of blessing, which, like the water of life, has\r\nflowed down the ages since the fourteenth century. Wycliffe accepted the\r\nHoly Scriptures with implicit faith as the inspired revelation of God’s\r\nwill, a sufficient rule of faith and practice. He had been educated to\r\nregard the Church of Rome as the divine, infallible authority, and to\r\naccept with unquestioning reverence the established teachings and customs\r\nof a thousand years; but he turned away from all these to listen to God’s\r\nholy word. This was the authority which he urged the people to\r\nacknowledge. Instead of the church speaking through the pope, he declared\r\nthe only true authority to be the voice of God speaking through His word.\r\nAnd he taught not only that the Bible is a perfect revelation of God’s\r\nwill, but that the Holy Spirit is its only interpreter, and that every man\r\nis, by the study of its teachings, to learn his duty for himself. Thus he\r\nturned the minds of men from the pope and the Church of Rome to the word\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nWycliffe was one of the greatest of the Reformers. In breadth of\r\nintellect, in clearness of thought, in firmness to maintain the truth, and\r\nboldness to defend it, he was equaled by few who came after him. Purity of\r\nlife, unwearying diligence in study and in labor, incorruptible integrity,\r\nand Christlike love and faithfulness in his ministry, characterized the\r\nfirst of the Reformers. And this notwithstanding the intellectual darkness\r\nand moral corruption of the age from which he emerged.\r\n\r\nThe character of Wycliffe is a testimony to the educating, transforming\r\npower of the Holy Scriptures. It was the Bible that made him what he was.\r\nThe effort to grasp the great truths of revelation imparts freshness and\r\nvigor to all the faculties. It expands the mind, sharpens the perceptions,\r\nand ripens the judgment. The study of the Bible will ennoble every\r\nthought, feeling, and aspiration as no other study can. It gives stability\r\nof purpose, patience, courage, and fortitude; it refines the character,\r\nand sanctifies the soul. An earnest, reverent study of the Scriptures,\r\nbringing the mind of the student in direct contact with the infinite mind,\r\nwould give to the world men of stronger and more active intellect, as well\r\nas of nobler principle, than has ever resulted from the ablest training\r\nthat human philosophy affords. “The entrance of Thy words,” says the\r\npsalmist, “giveth light; it giveth understanding.”(123)\r\n\r\nThe doctrines which had been taught by Wycliffe continued for a time to\r\nspread; his followers, known as Wycliffites and Lollards, not only\r\ntraversed England, but scattered to other lands, carrying the knowledge of\r\nthe gospel. Now that their leader was removed, the preachers labored with\r\neven greater zeal than before, and multitudes flocked to listen to their\r\nteachings. Some of the nobility, and even the wife of the king, were among\r\nthe converts. In many places there was a marked reform in the manners of\r\nthe people, and the idolatrous symbols of Romanism were removed from the\r\nchurches. But soon the pitiless storm of persecution burst upon those who\r\nhad dared to accept the Bible as their guide. The English monarchs, eager\r\nto strengthen their power by securing the support of Rome, did not\r\nhesitate to sacrifice the Reformers. For the first time in the history of\r\nEngland, the stake was decreed against the disciples of the gospel.\r\nMartyrdom succeeded martyrdom. The advocates of truth, proscribed and\r\ntortured, could only pour their cries into the ear of the Lord of Sabaoth.\r\nHunted as foes of the church and traitors to the realm, they continued to\r\npreach in secret places, finding shelter as best they could in the humble\r\nhomes of the poor, and often hiding away even in dens and caves.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the rage of persecution, a calm, devout, earnest, patient\r\nprotest against the prevailing corruption of religious faith continued for\r\ncenturies to be uttered. The Christians of that early time had only a\r\npartial knowledge of the truth, but they had learned to love and obey\r\nGod’s word, and they patiently suffered for its sake. Like the disciples\r\nin apostolic days, many sacrificed their worldly possessions for the cause\r\nof Christ. Those who were permitted to dwell in their homes, gladly\r\nsheltered their banished brethren; and when they too were driven forth,\r\nthey cheerfully accepted the lot of the outcast. Thousands, it is true,\r\nterrified by the fury of their persecutors, purchased their freedom at the\r\nsacrifice of their faith, and went out of their prisons, clothed in\r\npenitents’ robes, to publish their recantation. But the number was not\r\nsmall—and among them were men of noble birth as well as the humble and\r\nlowly—who bore fearless testimony to the truth in dungeon cells, in\r\n“Lollard towers,” and in the midst of torture and flame, rejoicing that\r\nthey were counted worthy to know “the fellowship of His sufferings.”\r\n\r\nThe papists had failed to work their will with Wycliffe during his life,\r\nand their hatred could not be satisfied while his body rested quietly in\r\nthe grave. By the decree of the Council of Constance, more than forty\r\nyears after his death his bones were exhumed and publicly burned, and the\r\nashes were thrown into a neighboring brook. “This brook,” says an old\r\nwriter, “hath conveyed his ashes into Avon, Avon into Severn, Severn into\r\nthe narrow seas, they into the main ocean. And thus the ashes of Wycliffe\r\nare the emblem of his doctrine, which now is dispersed all the world\r\nover.”(124) Little did his enemies realize the significance of their\r\nmalicious act.\r\n\r\nIt was through the writings of Wycliffe that John Huss, of Bohemia, was\r\nled to renounce many of the errors of Romanism, and to enter upon the work\r\nof reform. Thus in these two countries, so widely separated, the seed of\r\ntruth was sown. From Bohemia the work extended to other lands. The minds\r\nof men were directed to the long-forgotten word of God. A divine hand was\r\npreparing the way for the Great Reformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. HUSS AND JEROME.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nThe gospel had been planted in Bohemia as early as the ninth century. The\r\nBible was translated, and public worship was conducted, in the language of\r\nthe people. But as the power of the pope increased, so the word of God was\r\nobscured. Gregory VII., who had taken it upon him to humble the pride of\r\nkings, was no less intent upon enslaving the people, and accordingly a\r\nbull was issued forbidding public worship to be conducted in the Bohemian\r\ntongue. The pope declared that “it was pleasing to the Omnipotent that His\r\nworship should be celebrated in an unknown language, and that many evils\r\nand heresies had arisen from not observing this rule.”(125) Thus Rome\r\ndecreed that the light of God’s word should be extinguished, and the\r\npeople should be shut up in darkness. But Heaven had provided other\r\nagencies for the preservation of the church. Many of the Waldenses and\r\nAlbigenses, driven by persecution from their homes in France and Italy,\r\ncame to Bohemia. Though they dared not teach openly, they labored\r\nzealously in secret. Thus the true faith was preserved from century to\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nBefore the days of Huss, there were men in Bohemia who rose up to condemn\r\nopenly the corruption in the church and the profligacy of the people.\r\nTheir labors excited widespread interest. The fears of the hierarchy were\r\nroused, and persecution was opened against the disciples of the gospel.\r\nDriven to worship in the forests and the mountains, they were hunted by\r\nsoldiers, and many were put to death. After a time it was decreed that all\r\nwho departed from the Romish worship should be burned. But while the\r\nChristians yielded up their lives, they looked forward to the triumph of\r\ntheir cause. One of those who “taught that salvation was only to be found\r\nby faith in the crucified Saviour,” declared when dying, “The rage of the\r\nenemies of the truth now prevails against us, but it will not be forever;\r\nthere shall arise one from among the common people, without sword or\r\nauthority, and against him they shall not be able to prevail.”(126)\r\nLuther’s time was yet far distant; but already one was rising, whose\r\ntestimony against Rome would stir the nations.\r\n\r\nJohn Huss was of humble birth, and was early left an orphan by the death\r\nof his father. His pious mother, regarding education and the fear of God\r\nas the most valuable of possessions, sought to secure this heritage for\r\nher son. Huss studied at the provincial school, and then repaired to the\r\nuniversity at Prague, receiving admission as a charity scholar. He was\r\naccompanied on the journey to Prague by his mother; widowed and poor, she\r\nhad no gift of worldly wealth to bestow upon her son, but as they drew\r\nnear to the great city, she kneeled down beside the fatherless youth, and\r\ninvoked for him the blessing of their Father in heaven. Little did that\r\nmother realize how her prayer was to be answered.\r\n\r\nAt the university, Huss soon distinguished himself by his untiring\r\napplication and rapid progress, while his blameless life and gentle,\r\nwinning deportment gained him universal esteem. He was a sincere adherent\r\nof the Roman Church, and an earnest seeker for the spiritual blessings\r\nwhich it professes to bestow. On the occasion of a jubilee, he went to\r\nconfession, paid the last few coins in his scanty store, and joined in the\r\nprocessions, that he might share in the absolution promised. After\r\ncompleting his college course, he entered the priesthood, and rapidly\r\nattaining to eminence, he soon became attached to the court of the king.\r\nHe was also made professor and afterward rector of the university where he\r\nhad received his education. In a few years the humble charity scholar had\r\nbecome the pride of his country, and his name was renowned throughout\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nBut it was in another field that Huss began the work of reform. Several\r\nyears after taking priest’s orders he was appointed preacher of the chapel\r\nof Bethlehem. The founder of this chapel had advocated, as a matter of\r\ngreat importance, the preaching of the Scriptures in the language of the\r\npeople. Notwithstanding Rome’s opposition to this practice, it had not\r\nbeen wholly discontinued in Bohemia. But there was great ignorance of the\r\nBible, and the worst vices prevailed among the people of all ranks. These\r\nevils Huss unsparingly denounced, appealing to the word of God to enforce\r\nthe principles of truth and purity which he inculcated.\r\n\r\nA citizen of Prague, Jerome, who afterward became so closely associated\r\nwith Huss, had, on returning from England, brought with him the writings\r\nof Wycliffe. The queen of England, who had been a convert to Wycliffe’s\r\nteachings, was a Bohemian princess, and through her influence also the\r\nReformer’s works were widely circulated in her native country. These works\r\nHuss read with interest; he believed their author to be a sincere\r\nChristian, and was inclined to regard with favor the reforms which he\r\nadvocated. Already, though he knew it not, Huss had entered upon a path\r\nwhich was to lead him far away from Rome.\r\n\r\nAbout this time there arrived in Prague two strangers from England, men of\r\nlearning, who had received the light, and had come to spread it in this\r\ndistant land. Beginning with an open attack on the pope’s supremacy, they\r\nwere soon silenced by the authorities; but being unwilling to relinquish\r\ntheir purpose, they had recourse to other measures. Being artists as well\r\nas preachers, they proceeded to exercise their skill. In a place open to\r\nthe public they drew two pictures. One represented the entrance of Christ\r\ninto Jerusalem, “meek, and sitting upon an ass,”(127) and followed by His\r\ndisciples in travel-worn garments and with naked feet. The other picture\r\nportrayed a pontifical procession,—the pope arrayed in his rich robes and\r\ntriple crown, mounted upon a horse magnificently adorned, preceded by\r\ntrumpeters, and followed by cardinals and prelates in dazzling array.\r\n\r\nHere was a sermon which arrested the attention of all classes. Crowds came\r\nto gaze upon the drawings. None could fail to read the moral, and many\r\nwere deeply impressed by the contrast between the meekness and humility of\r\nChrist the Master, and the pride and arrogance of the pope, His professed\r\nservant. There was great commotion in Prague, and the strangers after a\r\ntime found it necessary, for their own safety, to depart. But the lesson\r\nthey had taught was not forgotten. The pictures made a deep impression on\r\nthe mind of Huss, and led him to a closer study of the Bible and of\r\nWycliffe’s writings. Though he was not prepared, even yet, to accept all\r\nthe reforms advocated by Wycliffe, he saw more clearly the true character\r\nof the papacy, and with greater zeal denounced the pride, the ambition,\r\nand the corruption of the hierarchy.\r\n\r\nFrom Bohemia the light extended to Germany; for disturbances in the\r\nUniversity of Prague caused the withdrawal of hundreds of German students.\r\nMany of them had received from Huss their first knowledge of the Bible,\r\nand on their return they spread the gospel in their fatherland.\r\n\r\nTidings of the work at Prague were carried to Rome, and Huss was soon\r\nsummoned to appear before the pope. To obey would be to expose himself to\r\ncertain death. The king and queen of Bohemia, the university, members of\r\nthe nobility, and officers of the government, united in an appeal to the\r\npontiff that Huss be permitted to remain at Prague, and to answer at Rome\r\nby deputy. Instead of granting this request, the pope proceeded to the\r\ntrial and condemnation of Huss, and then declared the city of Prague to be\r\nunder interdict.\r\n\r\nIn that age this sentence, whenever pronounced, created wide-spread alarm.\r\nThe ceremonies by which it was accompanied were well adapted to strike\r\nterror to a people who looked upon the pope as the representative of God\r\nHimself, holding the keys of heaven and hell, and possessing power to\r\ninvoke temporal as well as spiritual judgments. It was believed that the\r\ngates of heaven were closed against the region smitten with interdict;\r\nthat until it should please the pope to remove the ban, the dead were shut\r\nout from the abodes of bliss. In token of this terrible calamity, all the\r\nservices of religion were suspended. The churches were closed. Marriages\r\nwere solemnized in the churchyard. The dead, denied burial in consecrated\r\nground, were interred, without the rites of sepulture, in the ditches or\r\nthe fields. Thus by measures which appealed to the imagination, Rome\r\nessayed to control the consciences of men.\r\n\r\nThe city of Prague was filled with tumult. A large class denounced Huss as\r\nthe cause of all their calamities, and demanded that he be given up to the\r\nvengeance of Rome. To quiet the storm, the Reformer withdrew for a time to\r\nhis native village. Writing to the friends whom he had left at Prague, he\r\nsaid: “If I have withdrawn from the midst of you, it is to follow the\r\nprecept and example of Jesus Christ, in order not to give room to the\r\nill-minded to draw on themselves eternal condemnation, and in order not to\r\nbe to the pious a cause of affliction and persecution, I have retired also\r\nthrough an apprehension that impious priests might continue for a longer\r\ntime to prohibit the preaching of the word of God amongst you; but I have\r\nnot quitted you to deny the divine truth, for which, with God’s\r\nassistance, I am willing to die.”(128) Huss did not cease his labors, but\r\ntraveled through the surrounding country, preaching to eager crowds. Thus\r\nthe measures to which the pope resorted to suppress the gospel, were\r\ncausing it to be the more widely extended. “We can do nothing against the\r\ntruth, but for the truth.”(129)\r\n\r\n“The mind of Huss, at this stage of his career, would seem to have been\r\nthe scene of a painful conflict. Although the church was seeking to\r\noverwhelm him by her thunderbolts, he had not renounced her authority. The\r\nRoman Church was still to him the spouse of Christ, and the pope was the\r\nrepresentative and vicar of God. What Huss was warring against was the\r\nabuse of authority, not the principle itself. This brought on a terrible\r\nconflict between the convictions of his understanding and the claims of\r\nhis conscience. If the authority was just and infallible, as he believed\r\nit to be, how came it that he felt compelled to disobey it? To obey, he\r\nsaw, was to sin; but why should obedience to an infallible church lead to\r\nsuch an issue? This was the problem he could not solve; this was the doubt\r\nthat tortured him hour by hour. The nearest approximation to a solution\r\nwhich he was able to make, was that it had happened again, as once before\r\nin the days of the Saviour, that the priests of the church had become\r\nwicked persons, and were using their lawful authority for unlawful ends.\r\nThis led him to adopt for his own guidance, and to preach to others for\r\ntheirs, the maxim that the precepts of Scripture, conveyed through the\r\nunderstanding, are to rule the conscience; in other words, that God\r\nspeaking in the Bible, and not the church speaking through the priesthood,\r\nis the one infallible guide.”(130)\r\n\r\nWhen after a time the excitement in Prague subsided, Huss returned to his\r\nchapel of Bethlehem, to continue with greater zeal and courage the\r\npreaching of the word of God. His enemies were active and powerful, but\r\nthe queen and many of the nobles were his friends, and the people in great\r\nnumbers sided with him. Comparing his pure and elevating teachings and\r\nholy life with the degrading dogmas which the Romanists preached, and the\r\navarice and debauchery which they practised, many regarded it an honor to\r\nbe on his side.\r\n\r\nHitherto Huss had stood alone in his labors; but now Jerome, who while in\r\nEngland had accepted the teachings of Wycliffe, joined in the work of\r\nreform. The two were hereafter united in their lives, and in death they\r\nwere not to be divided. Brilliancy of genius, eloquence and learning—gifts\r\nthat win popular favor—were possessed in a preeminent degree by Jerome;\r\nbut in those qualities which constitute real strength of character, Huss\r\nwas the greater. His calm judgment served as a restraint upon the\r\nimpulsive spirit of Jerome, who, with true humility, perceived his worth,\r\nand yielded to his counsels. Under their united labors the reform was more\r\nrapidly extended.\r\n\r\nGod permitted great light to shine upon the minds of these chosen men,\r\nrevealing to them many of the errors of Rome; but they did not receive all\r\nthe light that was to be given to the world. Through these, His servants,\r\nGod was leading the people out of the darkness of Romanism; but there were\r\nmany and great obstacles for them to meet, and He led them on, step by\r\nstep, as they could bear it. They were not prepared to receive all the\r\nlight at once. Like the full glory of the noontide sun to those who have\r\nlong dwelt in darkness, it would, if presented, have caused them to turn\r\naway. Therefore He revealed it to the leaders little by little, as it\r\ncould be received by the people. From century to century, other faithful\r\nworkers were to follow, to lead the people on still farther in the path of\r\nreform.\r\n\r\nThe schism in the church still continued. Three popes were now contending\r\nfor the supremacy, and their strife filled Christendom with crime and\r\ntumult. Not content with hurling anathemas, they resorted to temporal\r\nweapons. Each cast about him to purchase arms and to obtain soldiers. Of\r\ncourse money must be had; and to procure this, the gifts, offices, and\r\nblessings of the church were offered for sale.(131) The priests also,\r\nimitating their superiors, resorted to simony and war to humble their\r\nrivals and strengthen their own power. With daily increasing boldness,\r\nHuss thundered against the abominations which were tolerated in the name\r\nof religion; and the people openly accused the Romish leaders as the cause\r\nof the miseries that overwhelmed Christendom.\r\n\r\nAgain the city of Prague seemed on the verge of a bloody conflict. As in\r\nformer ages, God’s servant was accused as “he that troubleth Israel.”(132)\r\nThe city was again placed under interdict, and Huss withdrew to his native\r\nvillage. The testimony so faithfully borne from his loved chapel of\r\nBethlehem was ended. He was to speak from a wider stage, to all\r\nChristendom, before laying down his life as a witness for the truth.\r\n\r\nTo cure the evils that were distracting Europe, a general council was\r\nsummoned to meet at Constance. The council was called at the desire of the\r\nemperor Sigismund, by one of the three rival popes, John XXIII. The demand\r\nfor a council had been far from welcome to Pope John, whose character and\r\npolicy could ill bear investigation, even by prelates as lax in morals as\r\nwere the churchmen of those times. He dared not, however, oppose the will\r\nof Sigismund.(133)\r\n\r\nThe chief objects to be accomplished by the council were to heal the\r\nschism in the church, and to root out heresy. Hence the two anti-popes\r\nwere summoned to appear before it, as well as the leading propagator of\r\nthe new opinions, John Huss. The former, having regard to their own\r\nsafety, did not attend in person, but were represented by their delegates.\r\nPope John, while ostensibly the convoker of the council, came to it with\r\nmany misgivings, suspecting the emperor’s secret purpose to depose him,\r\nand fearing to be brought to account for the vices which had disgraced the\r\ntiara, as well as for the crimes which had secured it. Yet he made his\r\nentry into the city of Constance with great pomp, attended by\r\necclesiastics of the highest rank, and followed by a train of courtiers.\r\nAll the clergy and dignitaries of the city, with an immense crowd of\r\ncitizens, went out to welcome him. Above his head was a golden canopy,\r\nborne by four of the chief magistrates. The host was carried before him,\r\nand the rich dresses of the cardinals and nobles made an imposing display.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile another traveler was approaching Constance. Huss was conscious\r\nof the dangers which threatened him. He parted from his friends as if he\r\nwere never to meet them again, and went on his journey feeling that it was\r\nleading him to the stake. Notwithstanding he had obtained a safe-conduct\r\nfrom the king of Bohemia, and received one also from the emperor Sigismund\r\nwhile on his journey, he made all his arrangements in view of the\r\nprobability of his death.\r\n\r\nIn a letter addressed to his friends at Prague he said: “My brethren, ...\r\nI am departing with a safe-conduct from the king, to meet my numerous and\r\nmortal enemies.... I confide altogether in the all-powerful God, in my\r\nSaviour; I trust that He will listen to your ardent prayers, that He will\r\ninfuse His prudence and His wisdom into my mouth, in order that I may\r\nresist them; and that He will accord me His Holy Spirit to fortify me in\r\nHis truth, so that I may face with courage, temptations, prison, and if\r\nnecessary, a cruel death. Jesus Christ suffered for His well-beloved; and\r\ntherefore ought we to be astonished that He has left us His example, in\r\norder that we may ourselves endure with patience all things for our own\r\nsalvation? He is God, and we are His creatures; He is the Lord, and we are\r\nHis servants; He is Master of the world, and we are contemptible\r\nmortals:—yet He suffered! Why, then, should we not suffer also,\r\nparticularly when suffering is for us a purification? Therefore, beloved,\r\nif my death ought to contribute to His glory, pray that it may come\r\nquickly, and that He may enable me to support all my calamities with\r\nconstancy. But if it be better that I return amongst you, let us pray to\r\nGod that I may return without stain,—that is, that I may not suppress one\r\ntittle of the truth of the gospel, in order to leave my brethren an\r\nexcellent example to follow. Probably, therefore, you will never more\r\nbehold my face at Prague: but should the will of the all-powerful God\r\ndeign to restore me to you, let us then advance with a firmer heart in the\r\nknowledge and the love of His law.”(134)\r\n\r\nIn another letter, to a priest who had become a disciple of the gospel,\r\nHuss spoke with deep humility of his own errors, accusing himself “of\r\nhaving felt pleasure in wearing rich apparel, and of having wasted hours\r\nin frivolous occupations.” He then added these touching admonitions: “May\r\nthe glory of God and the salvation of souls occupy thy mind, and not the\r\npossession of benefices and estates. Beware of adorning thy house more\r\nthan thy soul; and above all, give thy care to the spiritual edifice. Be\r\npious and humble with the poor, and consume not thy substance in feasting.\r\nShouldst thou not amend thy life and refrain from superfluities, I fear\r\nthat thou wilt be severely chastened, as I am myself.... Thou knowest my\r\ndoctrine, for thou hast received my instructions from thy childhood; it is\r\ntherefore useless for me to write to thee any further. But I conjure thee,\r\nby the mercy of our Lord, not to imitate me in any of the vanities into\r\nwhich thou hast seen me fall.” On the cover of the letter he added, “I\r\nconjure thee, my friend, not to break this seal until thou shalt have\r\nacquired the certitude that I am dead.”(135)\r\n\r\nOn his journey, Huss everywhere beheld indications of the spread of his\r\ndoctrines, and the favor with which his cause was regarded. The people\r\nthronged to meet him, and in some towns the magistrates attended him\r\nthrough their streets.\r\n\r\nUpon arriving at Constance, Huss was granted full liberty. To the\r\nemperor’s safe-conduct was added a personal assurance of protection by the\r\npope. But in violation of these solemn and repeated declarations, the\r\nReformer was in a short time arrested, by order of the pope and cardinals,\r\nand thrust into a loathsome dungeon. Later he was transferred to a strong\r\ncastle across the Rhine, and there kept a prisoner. The pope, profiting\r\nlittle by his perfidy, was soon after committed to the same prison.(136)\r\nHe had been proved before the council to be guilty of the basest crimes,\r\nbesides murder, simony, and adultery, “sins not fit to be named.” So the\r\ncouncil itself declared; and he was finally deprived of the tiara, and\r\nthrown into prison. The anti-popes also were deposed, and a new pontiff\r\nwas chosen.\r\n\r\nThough the pope himself had been guilty of greater crimes than Huss had\r\never charged upon the priests, and for which he had demanded a\r\nreformation, yet the same council which degraded the pontiff proceeded to\r\ncrush the Reformer. The imprisonment of Huss excited great indignation in\r\nBohemia. Powerful noblemen addressed to the council earnest protests\r\nagainst this outrage. The emperor, who was loath to permit the violation\r\nof a safe-conduct, opposed the proceedings against him. But the enemies of\r\nthe Reformer were malignant and determined. They appealed to the emperor’s\r\nprejudices, to his fears, to his zeal for the church. They brought forward\r\narguments of great length to prove that “faith ought not to be kept with\r\nheretics, nor persons suspected of heresy, though they are furnished with\r\nsafe-conducts from the emperor and kings.”(137) Thus they prevailed.\r\n\r\nEnfeebled by illness and imprisonment,—for the damp, foul air of his\r\ndungeon had brought on a fever which nearly ended his life,—Huss was at\r\nlast brought before the council. Loaded with chains, he stood in the\r\npresence of the emperor, whose honor and good faith had been pledged to\r\nprotect him. During his long trial he firmly maintained the truth, and in\r\nthe presence of the assembled dignitaries of church and state, he uttered\r\na solemn and faithful protest against the corruptions of the hierarchy.\r\nWhen required to choose whether he would recant his doctrines or suffer\r\ndeath, he accepted the martyr’s fate.\r\n\r\nThe grace of God sustained him. During the weeks of suffering that passed\r\nbefore his final sentence, heaven’s peace filled his soul. “I write this\r\nletter,” he said to a friend, “in my prison, and with my fettered hand,\r\nexpecting my sentence of death to-morrow.... When, with the assistance of\r\nJesus Christ, we shall again meet in the delicious peace of the future\r\nlife, you will learn how merciful God has shown Himself toward me, how\r\neffectually He has supported me in the midst of my temptations and\r\ntrials.”(138)\r\n\r\nIn the gloom of his dungeon he foresaw the triumph of the true faith.\r\nReturning in his dreams to the chapel at Prague where he had preached the\r\ngospel, he saw the pope and his bishops effacing the pictures of Christ\r\nwhich he had painted on its walls. “This vision distressed him: but on the\r\nnext day he saw many painters occupied in restoring these figures in\r\ngreater number and in brighter colors. As soon as their task was ended,\r\nthe painters, who were surrounded by an immense crowd, exclaimed, ‘Now let\r\nthe popes and bishops come; they shall never efface them more!’ ” Said the\r\nReformer, as he related his dream, “I maintain this for certain, that the\r\nimage of Christ will never be effaced. They have wished to destroy it, but\r\nit shall be painted afresh in all hearts by much better preachers than\r\nmyself.”(139)\r\n\r\nFor the last time, Huss was brought before the council. It was a vast and\r\nbrilliant assembly,—the emperor, the princes of the empire, the royal\r\ndeputies, the cardinals, bishops, and priests, and an immense crowd who\r\nhad come as spectators of the events of the day. From all parts of\r\nChristendom had been gathered the witnesses of this first great sacrifice\r\nin the long struggle by which liberty of conscience was to be secured.\r\n\r\nBeing called upon for his final decision, Huss declared his refusal to\r\nabjure, and fixing his penetrating glance upon the monarch whose plighted\r\nword had been so shamelessly violated, he declared, “I determined, of my\r\nown free will, to appear before this council, under the public protection\r\nand faith of the emperor here present.”(140) A deep flush crimsoned the\r\nface of Sigismund as the eyes of all in the assembly turned upon him.\r\n\r\nSentence having been pronounced, the ceremony of degradation began. The\r\nbishops clothed their prisoner in the sacerdotal habit, and as he took the\r\npriestly robe, he said, “Our Lord Jesus Christ was covered with a white\r\nrobe, by way of insult, when Herod had Him conducted before Pilate.”(141)\r\nBeing again exhorted to retract, he replied, turning toward the people:\r\n“With what face, then, should I behold the heavens? How should I look on\r\nthose multitudes of men to whom I have preached the pure gospel? No; I\r\nesteem their salvation more than this poor body, now appointed unto\r\ndeath.” The vestments were removed one by one, each bishop pronouncing a\r\ncurse as he performed his part of the ceremony. Finally “they put on his\r\nhead a cap or pyramidal-shaped mitre of paper, on which were painted\r\nfrightful figures of demons, with the word ‘Arch-Heretic’ conspicuous in\r\nfront. ‘Most joyfully,’ said Huss, ‘will I wear this crown of shame for\r\nThy sake, O Jesus, who for me didst wear a crown of thorns.’ ”\r\n\r\nWhen he was thus arrayed, “the prelates said, ‘Now we devote thy soul to\r\nthe devil.’ ‘And I,’ said John Huss, lifting up his eyes toward heaven,\r\n‘do commit my spirit into Thy hands, O Lord Jesus, for Thou hast redeemed\r\nme.’ ”(142)\r\n\r\nHe was now delivered up to the secular authorities, and led away to the\r\nplace of execution. An immense procession followed, hundreds of men at\r\narms, priests and bishops in their costly robes, and the inhabitants of\r\nConstance. When he had been fastened to the stake, and all was ready for\r\nthe fire to be lighted, the martyr was once more exhorted to save himself\r\nby renouncing his errors. “What errors,” said Huss, “shall I renounce? I\r\nknow myself guilty of none. I call God to witness that all that I have\r\nwritten and preached has been with the view of rescuing souls from sin and\r\nperdition; and, therefore, most joyfully will I confirm with my blood that\r\ntruth which I have written and preached.”(143) When the flames kindled\r\nabout him, he began to sing, “Jesus, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me,”\r\nand so continued till his voice was silenced forever.\r\n\r\nEven his enemies were struck with his heroic bearing. A zealous papist,\r\ndescribing the martyrdom of Huss, and of Jerome, who died soon after,\r\nsaid: “Both bore themselves with constant mind when their last hour\r\napproached. They prepared for the fire as if they were going to a marriage\r\nfeast. They uttered no cry of pain. When the flames rose, they began to\r\nsing hymns; and scarce could the vehemency of the fire stop their\r\nsinging.”(144)\r\n\r\nWhen the body of Huss had been wholly consumed, his ashes, with the soil\r\nupon which they rested, were gathered up and cast into the Rhine, and thus\r\nborne onward to the ocean. His persecutors vainly imagined that they had\r\nrooted out the truths he preached. Little did they dream that the ashes\r\nthat day borne away to the sea were to be as seed scattered in all the\r\ncountries of the earth; that in lands yet unknown it would yield abundant\r\nfruit in witnesses for the truth. The voice which had spoken in the\r\ncouncil hall of Constance had wakened echoes that would be heard through\r\nall coming ages. Huss was no more, but the truths for which he died could\r\nnever perish. His example of faith and constancy would encourage\r\nmultitudes to stand firm for the truth, in the face of torture and death.\r\nHis execution had exhibited to the whole world the perfidious cruelty of\r\nRome. The enemies of truth, though they knew it not, had been furthering\r\nthe cause which they vainly sought to destroy.\r\n\r\nYet another stake was to be set up at Constance. The blood of another\r\nwitness must testify for the truth. Jerome, upon bidding farewell to Huss\r\non his departure for the council, had exhorted him to courage and\r\nfirmness, declaring that if he should fall into any peril, he himself\r\nwould fly to his assistance. Upon hearing of the Reformer’s imprisonment,\r\nthe faithful disciple immediately prepared to fulfil his promise. Without\r\na safe-conduct he set out, with a single companion, for Constance. On\r\narriving there he was convinced that he had only exposed himself to peril,\r\nwithout the possibility of doing anything for the deliverance of Huss. He\r\nfled from the city, but was arrested on the homeward journey, and brought\r\nback loaded with fetters, and under the custody of a band of soldiers. At\r\nhis first appearance before the council, his attempts to reply to the\r\naccusations brought against him were met with shouts, “To the flames with\r\nhim! to the flames!”(145) He was thrown into a dungeon, chained in a\r\nposition which caused him great suffering, and fed on bread and water.\r\nAfter some months the cruelties of his imprisonment brought upon Jerome an\r\nillness that threatened his life, and his enemies, fearing that he might\r\nescape them, treated him with less severity, though he remained in prison\r\nfor one year.\r\n\r\nThe death of Huss had not resulted as the papists had hoped. The violation\r\nof his safe-conduct had roused a storm of indignation, and as the safer\r\ncourse, the council determined, instead of burning Jerome, to force him,\r\nif possible, to retract. He was brought before the assembly, and offered\r\nthe alternative to recant, or to die at the stake. Death at the beginning\r\nof his imprisonment would have been a mercy, in comparison with the\r\nterrible sufferings which he had undergone; but now, weakened by illness,\r\nby the rigors of his prison-house, and the torture of anxiety and\r\nsuspense, separated from his friends, and disheartened by the death of\r\nHuss, Jerome’s fortitude gave way, and he consented to submit to the\r\ncouncil. He pledged himself to adhere to the Catholic faith, and accepted\r\nthe action of the council in condemning the doctrines of Wycliffe and\r\nHuss, excepting, however, the “holy truths” which they had taught.(146)\r\n\r\nBy this expedient Jerome endeavored to silence the voice of conscience and\r\nescape his doom. But in the solitude of his dungeon he saw more clearly\r\nwhat he had done. He thought of the courage and fidelity of Huss, and in\r\ncontrast pondered upon his own denial of the truth. He thought of the\r\ndivine Master whom he had pledged himself to serve, and who for his sake\r\nendured the death of the cross. Before his retraction he had found\r\ncomfort, amid all his sufferings, in the assurance of God’s favor; but now\r\nremorse and doubt tortured his soul. He knew that still other retractions\r\nmust be made before he could be at peace with Rome. The path upon which he\r\nwas entering could end only in complete apostasy. His resolution was\r\ntaken: to escape a brief period of suffering he would not deny his Lord.\r\n\r\nSoon he was again brought before the council. His submission had not\r\nsatisfied his judges. Their thirst for blood, whetted by the death of\r\nHuss, clamored for fresh victims. Only by an unreserved surrender of the\r\ntruth could Jerome preserve his life. But he had determined to avow his\r\nfaith, and follow his brother-martyr to the flames.\r\n\r\nHe renounced his former recantation, and as a dying man, solemnly required\r\nan opportunity to make his defense. Fearing the effect of his words, the\r\nprelates insisted that he should merely affirm or deny the truth of the\r\ncharges brought against him. Jerome protested against such cruelty and\r\ninjustice. “You have held me shut up three hundred and forty days in a\r\nfrightful prison,” he said, “in the midst of filth, noisomeness, stench,\r\nand the utmost want of everything; you then bring me out before you, and\r\nlending an ear to my mortal enemies, you refuse to hear me.... If you be\r\nreally wise men, and the lights of the world, take care not to sin against\r\njustice. As to me, I am only a feeble mortal; my life is but of little\r\nimportance; and when I exhort you not to deliver an unjust sentence, I\r\nspeak less for myself than for you.”(147)\r\n\r\nHis request was finally granted. In the presence of his judges, Jerome\r\nkneeled down and prayed that the divine Spirit might control his thoughts\r\nand words, that he might speak nothing contrary to the truth or unworthy\r\nof his Master. To him that day was fulfilled the promise of God to the\r\nfirst disciples: “Ye shall be brought before governors and kings for My\r\nsake.... But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye\r\nshall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall\r\nspeak. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which\r\nspeaketh in you.”(148)\r\n\r\nThe words of Jerome excited astonishment and admiration, even in his\r\nenemies. For a whole year he had been immured in a dungeon, unable to read\r\nor even to see, in great physical suffering and mental anxiety. Yet his\r\narguments were presented with as much clearness and power as if he had had\r\nundisturbed opportunity for study. He pointed his hearers to the long line\r\nof holy men who had been condemned by unjust judges. In almost every\r\ngeneration have been those who, while seeking to elevate the people of\r\ntheir time, have been reproached and cast out, but who in later times have\r\nbeen shown to be deserving of honor. Christ Himself was condemned as a\r\nmalefactor at an unrighteous tribunal.\r\n\r\nAt his retraction, Jerome had assented to the justice of the sentence\r\ncondemning Huss; he now declared his repentance, and bore witness to the\r\ninnocence and holiness of the martyr. “I knew him from his childhood,” he\r\nsaid. “He was a most excellent man, just and holy; he was condemned,\r\nnotwithstanding his innocence.... I also—I am ready to die: I will not\r\nrecoil before the torments that are prepared for me by my enemies and\r\nfalse witnesses, who will one day have to render an account of their\r\nimpostures before the great God, whom nothing can deceive.”(149)\r\n\r\nIn self-reproach for his own denial of the truth, Jerome continued: “Of\r\nall the sins that I have committed since my youth, none weigh so heavily\r\non my mind, and cause me such poignant remorse, as that which I committed\r\nin this fatal place, when I approved of the iniquitous sentence rendered\r\nagainst Wycliffe, and against the holy martyr, John Huss, my master and my\r\nfriend. Yes! I confess it from my heart, and declare with horror that I\r\ndisgracefully quailed when, through a dread of death, I condemned their\r\ndoctrines. I therefore supplicate ... Almighty God to deign to pardon me\r\nmy sins, and this one in particular, the most heinous of all.” Pointing to\r\nhis judges, he said firmly: “You condemned Wycliffe and John Huss, not for\r\nhaving shaken the doctrine of the church, but simply because they branded\r\nwith reprobation the scandals proceeding from the clergy,—their pomp,\r\ntheir pride, and all the vices of the prelates and priests. The things\r\nwhich they have affirmed, and which are irrefutable, I also think and\r\ndeclare, like them.”\r\n\r\nHis words were interrupted. The prelates, trembling with rage, cried out,\r\n“What need is there of further proof? We behold with our own eyes the most\r\nobstinate of heretics!”\r\n\r\nUnmoved by the tempest, Jerome exclaimed: “What! do you suppose that I\r\nfear to die? You have held me for a whole year in a frightful dungeon,\r\nmore horrible than death itself. You have treated me more cruelly than a\r\nTurk, Jew, or pagan, and my flesh has literally rotted off my bones alive;\r\nand yet I make no complaint, for lamentation ill becomes a man of heart\r\nand spirit; but I cannot but express my astonishment at such great\r\nbarbarity toward a Christian.”(150)\r\n\r\nAgain the storm of rage burst out, and Jerome was hurried away to prison.\r\nYet there were some in the assembly upon whom his words had made a deep\r\nimpression, and who desired to save his life. He was visited by\r\ndignitaries of the church, and urged to submit himself to the council. The\r\nmost brilliant prospects were presented before him as the reward of\r\nrenouncing his opposition to Rome. But like his Master, when offered the\r\nglory of the world, Jerome remained steadfast.\r\n\r\n“Prove to me from the Holy Writings that I am in error,” he said, “and I\r\nwill abjure it.”\r\n\r\n“The Holy Writings!” exclaimed one of his tempters, “is everything then to\r\nbe judged by them? Who can understand them till the church has interpreted\r\nthem?”\r\n\r\n“Are the traditions of men more worthy of faith than the gospel of our\r\nSaviour?” replied Jerome. “Paul did not exhort those to whom he wrote to\r\nlisten to the traditions of men, but said, ‘Search the Scriptures.’ ”\r\n\r\n“Heretic!” was the response, “I repent having pleaded so long with you. I\r\nsee that you are urged on by the devil.”(151)\r\n\r\nErelong sentence of condemnation was passed upon him. He was led out to\r\nthe same spot upon which Huss had yielded up his life. He went singing on\r\nhis way, his countenance lighted up with joy and peace. His gaze was fixed\r\nupon Christ, and to him death had lost its terrors. When the executioner,\r\nabout to kindle the pile, stepped behind him, the martyr exclaimed, “Come\r\nforward boldly; apply the fire before my face. Had I been afraid, I should\r\nnot be here.”\r\n\r\nHis last words, uttered as the flames rose about him, were a prayer.\r\n“Lord, Almighty Father,” he cried, “have pity on me, and pardon me my\r\nsins; for Thou knowest that I have always loved Thy truth.”(152) His voice\r\nceased, but his lips continued to move in prayer. When the fire had done\r\nits work, the ashes of the martyr, with the earth upon which they rested,\r\nwere gathered up, and like those of Huss, were thrown into the Rhine.\r\n\r\nSo perished God’s faithful light-bearers. But the light of the truths\r\nwhich they proclaimed,—the light of their heroic example,—could not be\r\nextinguished. As well might men attempt to turn back the sun in its course\r\nas to prevent the dawning of that day which was even then breaking upon\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe execution of Huss had kindled a flame of indignation and horror in\r\nBohemia. It was felt by the whole nation that he had fallen a prey to the\r\nmalice of the priests and the treachery of the emperor. He was declared to\r\nhave been a faithful teacher of the truth, and the council that decreed\r\nhis death was charged with the guilt of murder. His doctrines now\r\nattracted greater attention than ever before. By the papal edicts the\r\nwritings of Wycliffe had been condemned to the flames. But those that had\r\nescaped destruction were now brought out from their hiding-places, and\r\nstudied in connection with the Bible, or such parts of it as the people\r\ncould obtain, and many were thus led to accept the reformed faith.\r\n\r\nThe murderers of Huss did not stand quietly by and witness the triumph of\r\nhis cause. The pope and the emperor united to crush out the movement, and\r\nthe armies of Sigismund were hurled upon Bohemia.\r\n\r\nBut a deliverer was raised up. Ziska, who soon after the opening of the\r\nwar became totally blind, yet who was one of the ablest generals of his\r\nage, was the leader of the Bohemians. Trusting in the help of God and the\r\nrighteousness of their cause, that people withstood the mightiest armies\r\nthat could be brought against them. Again and again the emperor, raising\r\nfresh armies, invaded Bohemia, only to be ignominiously repulsed. The\r\nHussites were raised above the fear of death, and nothing could stand\r\nagainst them. A few years after the opening of the war, the brave Ziska\r\ndied; but his place was filled by Procopius, who was an equally brave and\r\nskilful general, and in some respects a more able leader.\r\n\r\nThe enemies of the Bohemians, knowing that the blind warrior was dead,\r\ndeemed the opportunity favorable for recovering all that they had lost.\r\nThe pope now proclaimed a crusade against the Hussites, and again an\r\nimmense force was precipitated upon Bohemia, but only to suffer terrible\r\ndefeat. Another crusade was proclaimed. In all the papal countries of\r\nEurope, men, money, and munitions of war were raised. Multitudes flocked\r\nto the papal standard, assured that at last an end would be made of the\r\nHussite heretics. Confident of victory, the vast force entered Bohemia.\r\nThe people rallied to repel them. The two armies approached each other,\r\nuntil only a river lay between them. “The crusaders were in greatly\r\nsuperior force, but instead of dashing across the stream, and closing in\r\nbattle with the Hussites whom they had come so far to meet, they stood\r\ngazing in silence at those warriors.”(153) Then suddenly a mysterious\r\nterror fell upon the host. Without striking a blow, that mighty force\r\nbroke and scattered, as if dispelled by an unseen power. Great numbers\r\nwere slaughtered by the Hussite army, which pursued the fugitives, and an\r\nimmense booty fell into the hands of the victors, so that the war, instead\r\nof impoverishing, enriched the Bohemians.\r\n\r\nA few years later, under a new pope, still another crusade was set on\r\nfoot. As before, men and means were drawn from all the papal countries of\r\nEurope. Great were the inducements held out to those who should engage in\r\nthis perilous enterprise. Full forgiveness of the most heinous crimes was\r\ninsured to every crusader. All who died in the war were promised a rich\r\nreward in heaven, and those who survived were to reap honor and riches on\r\nthe field of battle. Again a vast army was collected, and crossing the\r\nfrontier they entered Bohemia. The Hussite forces fell back before them,\r\nthus drawing the invaders farther and farther into the country, and\r\nleading them to count the victory already won. At last the army of\r\nProcopius made a stand, and turning upon the foe, advanced to give them\r\nbattle. The crusaders, now discovering their mistake, lay in their\r\nencampment awaiting the onset. As the sound of the approaching force was\r\nheard, even before the Hussites were in sight, a panic again fell upon the\r\ncrusaders. Princes, generals, and common soldiers, casting away their\r\narmor, fled in all directions. In vain the papal legate, who was the\r\nleader of the invasion, endeavored to rally his terrified and disorganized\r\nforces. Despite his utmost endeavors, he himself was swept along in the\r\ntide of fugitives. The rout was complete, and again an immense booty fell\r\ninto the hands of the victors.\r\n\r\nThus the second time a vast army, sent forth by the most powerful nations\r\nof Europe, a host of brave, warlike men, trained and equipped for battle,\r\nfled without a blow, before the defenders of a small and hitherto feeble\r\nnation. Here was a manifestation of divine power. The invaders were\r\nsmitten with a supernatural terror. He who overthrew the hosts of Pharaoh\r\nin the Red Sea, who put to flight the armies of Midian before Gideon and\r\nhis three hundred, who in one night laid low the forces of the proud\r\nAssyrian, had again stretched out His hand to wither the power of the\r\noppressor. “There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath\r\nscattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them\r\nto shame, because God hath despised them.”(154)\r\n\r\nThe papal leaders, despairing of conquering by force, at last resorted to\r\ndiplomacy. A compromise was entered into, that while professing to grant\r\nto the Bohemians freedom of conscience, really betrayed them into the\r\npower of Rome. The Bohemians had specified four points as the condition of\r\npeace with Rome: The free preaching of the Bible; the right of the whole\r\nchurch to both the bread and the wine in the communion, and the use of the\r\nmother tongue in divine worship; the exclusion of the clergy from all\r\nsecular offices and authority; and in cases of crime, the jurisdiction of\r\nthe civil courts over clergy and laity alike. The papal authorities at\r\nlast “agreed that the four articles of the Hussites should be accepted,\r\nbut that the right of explaining them, that is, of determining their\r\nprecise import, should belong to the council—in other words, to the pope\r\nand the emperor.”(155) On this basis a treaty was entered into, and Rome\r\ngained by dissimulation and fraud what she had failed to gain by conflict;\r\nfor, placing her own interpretation upon the Hussite articles, as upon the\r\nBible, she could pervert their meaning to suit her own purposes.\r\n\r\nA large class in Bohemia, seeing that it betrayed their liberties, could\r\nnot consent to the compact. Dissensions and divisions arose, leading to\r\nstrife and bloodshed among themselves. In this strife the noble Procopius\r\nfell, and the liberties of Bohemia perished.\r\n\r\nSigismund, the betrayer of Huss and Jerome, now became king of Bohemia,\r\nand regardless of his oath to support the rights of the Bohemians, he\r\nproceeded to establish popery. But he had gained little by his\r\nsubservience to Rome. For twenty years his life had been filled with\r\nlabors and perils. His armies had been wasted and his treasuries drained\r\nby a long and fruitless struggle; and now, after reigning one year, he\r\ndied, leaving his kingdom on the brink of civil war, and bequeathing to\r\nposterity a name branded with infamy.\r\n\r\nTumults, strife, and bloodshed were protracted. Again foreign armies\r\ninvaded Bohemia, and internal dissension continued to distract the nation.\r\nThose who remained faithful to the gospel were subjected to a bloody\r\npersecution.\r\n\r\nAs their former brethren, entering into compact with Rome, imbibed her\r\nerrors, those who adhered to the ancient faith had formed themselves into\r\na distinct church, taking the name of “United Brethren.” This act drew\r\nupon them maledictions from all classes. Yet their firmness was unshaken.\r\nForced to find refuge in the woods and caves, they still assembled to read\r\nGod’s word and unite in His worship.\r\n\r\nThrough messengers secretly sent out into different countries, they\r\nlearned that here and there were “isolated confessors of the truth, a few\r\nin this city and a few in that, the object, like themselves, of\r\npersecution; and that amid the mountains of the Alps was an ancient\r\nchurch, resting on the foundations of Scripture, and protesting against\r\nthe idolatrous corruptions of Rome.”(156) This intelligence was received\r\nwith great joy, and a correspondence was opened with the Waldensian\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\nSteadfast to the gospel, the Bohemians waited through the night of their\r\npersecution; in the darkest hour still turning their eyes toward the\r\nhorizon like men who watch for the morning. “Their lot was cast in evil\r\ndays, but ... they remembered the words first uttered by Huss, and\r\nrepeated by Jerome, that a century must revolve before the day should\r\nbreak. These were to the Taborites [Hussites] what the words of Joseph\r\nwere to the tribes in the house of bondage: ‘I die, and God will surely\r\nvisit you, and bring you out.’ ”(157) “The closing period of the fifteenth\r\ncentury witnessed the slow but sure increase of the churches of the\r\nBrethren. Although far from being unmolested, they yet enjoyed comparative\r\nrest. At the commencement of the sixteenth century, their churches\r\nnumbered two hundred in Bohemia and Moravia.”(158) “So goodly was the\r\nremnant which, escaping the destructive fury of fire and sword, was\r\npermitted to see the dawning of that day which Huss had foretold.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. LUTHER’S SEPARATION FROM ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nForemost among those who were called to lead the church from the darkness\r\nof popery into the light of a purer faith, stood Martin Luther. Zealous,\r\nardent, and devoted, knowing no fear but the fear of God, and\r\nacknowledging no foundation for religious faith but the Holy Scriptures,\r\nLuther was the man for his time; through him, God accomplished a great\r\nwork for the reformation of the church and the enlightenment of the world.\r\n\r\nLike the first heralds of the gospel, Luther sprung from the ranks of\r\npoverty. His early years were spent in the humble home of a German\r\npeasant. By daily toil as a miner, his father earned the means for his\r\neducation. He intended him for a lawyer; but God purposed to make him a\r\nbuilder in the great temple that was rising so slowly through the\r\ncenturies. Hardship, privation, and severe discipline were the school in\r\nwhich Infinite Wisdom prepared Luther for the important mission of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nLuther’s father was a man of strong and active mind and great force of\r\ncharacter, honest, resolute, and straight-forward. He was true to his\r\nconvictions of duty, let the consequences be what they might. His sterling\r\ngood sense led him to regard the monastic system with distrust. He was\r\nhighly displeased when Luther, without his consent, entered a monastery;\r\nand it was two years before the father was reconciled to his son, and even\r\nthen his opinions remained the same.\r\n\r\nLuther’s parents bestowed great care upon the education and training of\r\ntheir children. They endeavored to instruct them in the knowledge of God\r\nand the practice of Christian virtues. The father’s prayer often ascended\r\nin the hearing of his son, that the child might remember the name of the\r\nLord, and one day aid in the advancement of His truth. Every advantage for\r\nmoral or intellectual culture which their life of toil permitted them to\r\nenjoy, was eagerly improved by these parents. Their efforts were earnest\r\nand persevering to prepare their children for a life of piety and\r\nusefulness. With their firmness and strength of character they sometimes\r\nexercised too great severity; but the Reformer himself, though conscious\r\nthat in some respects they had erred, found in their discipline more to\r\napprove than to condemn.\r\n\r\nAt school, where he was sent at an early age, Luther was treated with\r\nharshness and even violence. So great was the poverty of his parents, that\r\nupon going from home to school in another town he was for a time obliged\r\nto obtain his food by singing from door to door, and he often suffered\r\nfrom hunger. The gloomy, superstitious ideas of religion then prevailing\r\nfilled him with fear. He would lie down at night with a sorrowful heart,\r\nlooking forward with trembling to the dark future, and in constant terror\r\nat the thought of God as a stern, unrelenting judge, a cruel tyrant,\r\nrather than a kind heavenly Father.\r\n\r\nYet under so many and so great discouragements, Luther pressed resolutely\r\nforward toward the high standard of moral and intellectual excellence\r\nwhich attracted his soul. He thirsted for knowledge, and the earnest and\r\npractical character of his mind led him to desire the solid and useful\r\nrather than the showy and superficial.\r\n\r\nWhen, at the age of eighteen, he entered the University of Erfurt, his\r\nsituation was more favorable and his prospects were brighter than in his\r\nearlier years. His parents having by thrift and industry acquired a\r\ncompetence, they were able to render him all needed assistance. And the\r\ninfluence of judicious friends had somewhat lessened the gloomy effects of\r\nhis former training. He applied himself to the study of the best authors,\r\ndiligently treasuring their most weighty thoughts, and making the wisdom\r\nof the wise his own. Even under the harsh discipline of his former\r\ninstructors, he had early given promise of distinction; and with favorable\r\ninfluences his mind rapidly developed. A retentive memory, a lively\r\nimagination, strong reasoning powers, and untiring application, soon\r\nplaced him in the foremost rank among his associates. Intellectual\r\ndiscipline ripened his understanding, and aroused an activity of mind and\r\na keenness of perception that were preparing him for the conflicts of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe fear of the Lord dwelt in the heart of Luther, enabling him to\r\nmaintain his steadfastness of purpose, and leading him to deep humility\r\nbefore God. He had an abiding sense of his dependence upon divine aid, and\r\nhe did not fail to begin each day with prayer, while his heart was\r\ncontinually breathing a petition for guidance and support. “To pray well,”\r\nhe often said, “is the better half of study.”(159)\r\n\r\nWhile one day examining the books in the library of the university, Luther\r\ndiscovered a Latin Bible. Such a book he had never before seen. He was\r\nignorant even of its existence. He had heard portions of the Gospels and\r\nEpistles, which were read to the people at public worship, and he supposed\r\nthat these were the entire Bible. Now, for the first time, he looked upon\r\nthe whole of God’s word. With mingled awe and wonder he turned the sacred\r\npages; with quickened pulse and throbbing heart he read for himself the\r\nwords of life, pausing now and then to exclaim, “O that God would give me\r\nsuch a book for myself!”(160) Angels of heaven were by his side, and rays\r\nof light from the throne of God revealed the treasures of truth to his\r\nunderstanding. He had ever feared to offend God, but now the deep\r\nconviction of his condition as a sinner took hold upon him as never\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nAn earnest desire to be free from sin and to find peace with God, led him\r\nat last to enter a cloister, and devote himself to a monastic life. Here\r\nhe was required to perform the lowest drudgery, and to beg from house to\r\nhouse. He was at an age when respect and appreciation are most eagerly\r\ncraved, and these menial offices were deeply mortifying to his natural\r\nfeelings; but he patiently endured this humiliation, believing that it was\r\nnecessary because of his sins.\r\n\r\nEvery moment that could be spared from his daily duties he employed in\r\nstudy, robbing himself of sleep, and grudging even the time spent at his\r\nscanty meals. Above everything else he delighted in the study of God’s\r\nword. He had found a Bible chained to the convent wall, and to this he\r\noften repaired. As his convictions of sin deepened, he sought by his own\r\nworks to obtain pardon and peace. He led a most rigorous life, endeavoring\r\nby fasting, vigils, and scourgings to subdue the evils of his nature, from\r\nwhich the monastic life had brought no release. He shrank from no\r\nsacrifice by which he might attain to that purity of heart which would\r\nenable him to stand approved before God. “I was indeed a pious monk,” he\r\nafterward said, “and followed the rules of my order more strictly than I\r\ncan express. If ever monk could obtain heaven by his monkish works, I\r\nshould certainly have been entitled to it.... If it had continued much\r\nlonger, I should have carried my mortifications even to death.”(161) As\r\nthe result of this painful discipline, he lost strength, and suffered from\r\nfainting spasms, from the effects of which he never fully recovered. But\r\nwith all his efforts, his burdened soul found no relief. He was at last\r\ndriven to the verge of despair.\r\n\r\nWhen it appeared to Luther that all was lost, God raised up a friend and\r\nhelper for him. The pious Staupitz opened the word of God to Luther’s\r\nmind, and bade him look away from himself, cease the contemplation of\r\ninfinite punishment for the violation of God’s law, and look to Jesus, his\r\nsin-pardoning Saviour. “Instead of torturing yourself on account of your\r\nsins, throw yourself into the Redeemer’s arms. Trust in Him, in the\r\nrighteousness of His life, in the atonement of His death.... Listen to the\r\nSon of God. He became man to give you the assurance of divine favor,”\r\n“Love Him who first loved you.”(162) Thus spoke this messenger of mercy.\r\nHis words made a deep impression upon Luther’s mind. After many a struggle\r\nwith long-cherished errors, he was enabled to grasp the truth, and peace\r\ncame to his troubled soul.\r\n\r\nLuther was ordained a priest, and was called from the cloister to a\r\nprofessorship in the University of Wittenberg. Here he applied himself to\r\nthe study of the Scriptures in the original tongues. He began to lecture\r\nupon the Bible; and the book of Psalms, the Gospels, and the Epistles were\r\nopened to the understanding of crowds of delighted listeners. Staupitz,\r\nhis friend and superior, urged him to ascend the pulpit, and preach the\r\nword of God. Luther hesitated, feeling himself unworthy to speak to the\r\npeople in Christ’s stead. It was only after a long struggle that he\r\nyielded to the solicitations of his friends. Already he was mighty in the\r\nScriptures, and the grace of God rested upon him. His eloquence captivated\r\nhis hearers, the clearness and power with which he presented the truth\r\nconvinced their understanding, and his fervor touched their hearts.\r\n\r\nLuther was still a true son of the papal church, and had no thought that\r\nhe would ever be anything else. In the providence of God he was led to\r\nvisit Rome. He pursued his journey on foot, lodging at the monasteries on\r\nthe way. At a convent in Italy he was filled with wonder at the wealth,\r\nmagnificence, and luxury that he witnessed. Endowed with a princely\r\nrevenue, the monks dwelt in splendid apartments, attired themselves in the\r\nrichest and most costly robes, and feasted at a sumptuous table. With\r\npainful misgivings Luther contrasted this scene with the self-denial and\r\nhardship of his own life. His mind was becoming perplexed.\r\n\r\nAt last he beheld in the distance the seven-hilled city. With deep emotion\r\nhe prostrated himself upon the earth, exclaiming, “Holy Rome, I salute\r\nthee!”(163) He entered the city, visited the churches, listened to the\r\nmarvelous tales repeated by priests and monks, and performed all the\r\nceremonies required. Everywhere he looked upon scenes that filled him with\r\nastonishment and horror. He saw that iniquity existed among all classes of\r\nthe clergy. He heard indecent jokes from prelates, and was filled with\r\nhorror at their awful profanity, even during mass. As he mingled with the\r\nmonks and citizens, he met dissipation, debauchery. Turn where he would,\r\nin the place of sanctity he found profanation. “No one can imagine,” he\r\nwrote, “what sins and infamous actions are committed in Rome; they must be\r\nseen and heard to be believed. Thus they are in the habit of saying, ‘If\r\nthere is a hell, Rome is built over it: it is an abyss whence issues every\r\nkind of sin.’ ”(164)\r\n\r\nBy a recent decretal, an indulgence had been promised by the pope to all\r\nwho should ascend upon their knees “Pilate’s staircase,” said to have been\r\ndescended by our Saviour on leaving the Roman judgment hall, and to have\r\nbeen miraculously conveyed from Jerusalem to Rome. Luther was one day\r\ndevoutly climbing these steps, when suddenly a voice like thunder seemed\r\nto say to him, “The just shall live by faith.”(165) He sprung to his feet,\r\nand hastened from the place in shame and horror. That text never lost its\r\npower upon his soul. From that time he saw more clearly than ever before\r\nthe fallacy of trusting to human works for salvation, and the necessity of\r\nconstant faith in the merits of Christ. His eyes had been opened, and were\r\nnever again to be closed, to the delusions of the papacy. When he turned\r\nhis face from Rome, he had turned away also in heart, and from that time\r\nthe separation grew wider, until he severed all connection with the papal\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nAfter his return from Rome, Luther received at the University of\r\nWittenberg the degree of Doctor of Divinity. Now he was at liberty to\r\ndevote himself, as never before, to the Scriptures that he loved. He had\r\ntaken a solemn vow to study carefully and to preach with fidelity the word\r\nof God, not the sayings and doctrines of the popes, all the days of his\r\nlife. He was no longer the mere monk or professor, but the authorized\r\nherald of the Bible. He had been called as a shepherd to feed the flock of\r\nGod, that were hungering and thirsting for the truth. He firmly declared\r\nthat Christians should receive no other doctrines than those which rest on\r\nthe authority of the Sacred Scriptures. These words struck at the very\r\nfoundation of papal supremacy. They contained the vital principle of the\r\nReformation.\r\n\r\nLuther saw the danger of exalting human theories above the word of God. He\r\nfearlessly attacked the speculative infidelity of the schoolmen, and\r\nopposed the philosophy and theology which had so long held a controlling\r\ninfluence upon the people. He denounced such studies as not only worthless\r\nbut pernicious, and sought to turn the minds of his hearers from the\r\nsophistries of philosophers and theologians to the eternal truths set\r\nforth by prophets and apostles.\r\n\r\nPrecious was the message which he bore to the eager crowds that hung upon\r\nhis words. Never before had such teachings fallen upon their ears. The\r\nglad tidings of a Saviour’s love, the assurance of pardon and peace\r\nthrough His atoning blood, rejoiced their hearts, and inspired within them\r\nan immortal hope. At Wittenberg a light was kindled whose rays should\r\nextend to the uttermost parts of the earth, and which was to increase in\r\nbrightness to the close of time.\r\n\r\nBut light and darkness cannot harmonize. Between truth and error there is\r\nan irrepressible conflict. To uphold and defend the one is to attack and\r\noverthrow the other. Our Saviour Himself declared, “I came not to send\r\npeace, but a sword,”(166) Said Luther, a few years after the opening of\r\nthe Reformation: “God does not guide me, He pushes me forward, He carries\r\nme away. I am not master of myself. I desire to live in repose; but I am\r\nthrown into the midst of tumults and revolutions.”(167) He was now about\r\nto be urged into the contest.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Church had made merchandise of the grace of God. The tables of\r\nthe money-changers(168) were set up beside her altars, and the air\r\nresounded with the shouts of buyers and sellers. Under the plea of raising\r\nfunds for the erection of St. Peter’s church at Rome, indulgences for sin\r\nwere publicly offered for sale by the authority of the pope. By the price\r\nof crime a temple was to be built up for God’s worship,—the corner-stone\r\nlaid with the wages of iniquity! But the very means adopted for Rome’s\r\naggrandizement provoked the deadliest blow to her power and greatness. It\r\nwas this that aroused the most determined and successful of the enemies of\r\npopery, and led to the battle which shook the papal throne, and jostled\r\nthe triple crown upon the pontiff’s head.\r\n\r\nThe official appointed to conduct the sale of indulgences in\r\nGermany—Tetzel by name—had been convicted of the basest offenses against\r\nsociety and against the law of God; but having escaped the punishment due\r\nto his crimes, he was employed to further the mercenary and unscrupulous\r\nprojects of the pope. With great effrontery he repeated the most glaring\r\nfalsehoods, and related marvelous tales to deceive an ignorant, credulous,\r\nand superstitious people. Had they possessed the word of God, they would\r\nnot have been thus deceived. It was to keep them under the control of the\r\npapacy, in order to swell the power and wealth of her ambitious leaders,\r\nthat the Bible had been withheld from them.(169)\r\n\r\nAs Tetzel entered a town, a messenger went before him, announcing, “The\r\ngrace of God and of the holy father is at your gates.”(170) And the people\r\nwelcomed the blasphemous pretender as if he were God Himself come down\r\nfrom heaven to them. The infamous traffic was set up in the church, and\r\nTetzel, ascending the pulpit, extolled indulgences as the most precious\r\ngift of God. He declared that by virtue of his certificates of pardon, all\r\nthe sins which the purchaser should afterward desire to commit would be\r\nforgiven him, and that “not even repentance is necessary.”(171) More than\r\nthis, he assured his hearers that the indulgences had power to save not\r\nonly the living but the dead; that the very moment the money should clink\r\nagainst the bottom of his chest, the soul in whose behalf it had been paid\r\nwould escape from purgatory and make its way to heaven.(172)\r\n\r\nWhen Simon Magus offered to purchase of the apostles the power to work\r\nmiracles, Peter answered him, “Thy money perish with thee, because thou\r\nhast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.”(173) But\r\nTetzel’s offer was grasped by eager thousands. Gold and silver flowed into\r\nhis treasury. A salvation that could be bought with money was more easily\r\nobtained than that which requires repentance, faith, and diligent effort\r\nto resist and overcome sin.(174)\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of indulgences had been opposed by men of learning and piety\r\nin the Roman Church, and there were many who had no faith in pretensions\r\nso contrary to both reason and revelation. No prelate dared lift his voice\r\nagainst this iniquitous traffic; but the minds of men were becoming\r\ndisturbed and uneasy, and many eagerly inquired if God would not work\r\nthrough some instrumentality for the purification of His church.\r\n\r\nLuther, though still a papist of the straitest sort, was filled with\r\nhorror at the blasphemous assumptions of the indulgence mongers. Many of\r\nhis own congregation had purchased certificates of pardon, and they soon\r\nbegan to come to their pastor, confessing their various sins, and\r\nexpecting absolution, not because they were penitent and wished to reform,\r\nbut on the ground of the indulgence. Luther refused them absolution, and\r\nwarned them that unless they should repent and reform their lives, they\r\nmust perish in their sins. In great perplexity they repaired to Tetzel\r\nwith the complaint that their confessor had refused his certificates; and\r\nsome boldly demanded that their money be returned to them. The friar was\r\nfilled with rage. He uttered the most terrible curses, caused fires to be\r\nlighted in the public squares, and declared that he “had received an order\r\nfrom the pope to burn all heretics who presumed to oppose his most holy\r\nindulgences.”(175)\r\n\r\nLuther now entered boldly upon his work as a champion of the truth. His\r\nvoice was heard from the pulpit in earnest, solemn warning. He set before\r\nthe people the offensive character of sin, and taught them that it is\r\nimpossible for man, by his own works, to lessen its guilt or evade its\r\npunishment. Nothing but repentance toward God and faith in Christ can save\r\nthe sinner. The grace of Christ cannot be purchased; it is a free gift. He\r\ncounseled the people not to buy indulgences, but to look in faith to a\r\ncrucified Redeemer. He related his own painful experience in vainly\r\nseeking by humiliation and penance to secure salvation, and assured his\r\nhearers that it was by looking away from himself and believing in Christ\r\nthat he found peace and joy.\r\n\r\nAs Tetzel continued his traffic and his impious pretensions, Luther\r\ndetermined upon a more effectual protest against these crying abuses. An\r\noccasion soon offered. The castle church of Wittenberg possessed many\r\nrelics, which on certain holy days were exhibited to the people, and full\r\nremission of sins was granted to all who then visited the church and made\r\nconfession. Accordingly on these days the people in great numbers resorted\r\nthither. One of the most important of these occasions, the festival of\r\n“All Saints,” was approaching. On the preceding day, Luther, joining the\r\ncrowds that were already making their way to the church, posted on its\r\ndoor a paper containing ninety-five propositions against the doctrine of\r\nindulgences. He declared his willingness to defend these theses next day\r\nat the university, against all who should see fit to attack them.\r\n\r\nHis propositions attracted universal attention. They were read and\r\nre-read, and repeated in every direction. Great excitement was created in\r\nthe university and in the whole city. By these theses it was shown that\r\nthe power to grant the pardon of sin, and to remit its penalty, had never\r\nbeen committed to the pope or to any other man. The whole scheme was a\r\nfarce,—an artifice to extort money by playing upon the superstitions of\r\nthe people,—a device of Satan to destroy the souls of all who should trust\r\nto its lying pretensions. It was also clearly shown that the gospel of\r\nChrist is the most valuable treasure of the church, and that the grace of\r\nGod, therein revealed, is freely bestowed upon all who seek it by\r\nrepentance and faith.\r\n\r\nLuther’s theses challenged discussion; but no one dared accept the\r\nchallenge. The questions which he proposed had in a few days spread\r\nthrough all Germany, and in a few weeks they had sounded throughout\r\nChristendom. Many devoted Romanists, who had seen and lamented the\r\nterrible iniquity prevailing in the church, but had not known how to\r\narrest its progress, read the propositions with great joy, recognizing in\r\nthem the voice of God. They felt that the Lord had graciously set His hand\r\nto arrest the rapidly swelling tide of corruption that was issuing from\r\nthe see of Rome. Princes and magistrates secretly rejoiced that a check\r\nwas to be put upon the arrogant power which denied the right of appeal\r\nfrom its decisions.\r\n\r\nBut the sin-loving and superstitious multitudes were terrified as the\r\nsophistries that had soothed their fears were swept away. Crafty\r\necclesiastics, interrupted in their work of sanctioning crime, and seeing\r\ntheir gains endangered, were enraged, and rallied to uphold their\r\npretensions. The Reformer had bitter accusers to meet. Some charged him\r\nwith acting hastily and from impulse. Others accused him of presumption,\r\ndeclaring that he was not directed of God, but was acting from pride and\r\nforwardness. “Who does not know,” he responded, “that a man rarely puts\r\nforth any new idea without having some appearance of pride, and without\r\nbeing accused of exciting quarrels?... Why were Christ and all the martyrs\r\nput to death? Because they seemed to be proud contemners of the wisdom of\r\nthe time, and because they advanced novelties without having first humbly\r\ntaken counsel of the oracles of the ancient opinions.”\r\n\r\nAgain he declared: “Whatever I do will be done, not by the prudence of\r\nmen, but by the counsel of God. If the work be of God, who shall stop it?\r\nif it be not, who can forward it? Not my will, nor theirs, nor ours; but\r\nThy will, O holy Father, which art in heaven.”(176)\r\n\r\nThough Luther had been moved by the Spirit of God to begin his work, he\r\nwas not to carry it forward without severe conflicts. The reproaches of\r\nhis enemies, their misrepresentation of his purposes, and their unjust and\r\nmalicious reflections upon his character and motives, came in upon him\r\nlike an overwhelming flood; and they were not without effect. He had felt\r\nconfident that the leaders of the people, both in the church and in the\r\nschools, would gladly unite with him in efforts for reform. Words of\r\nencouragement from those in high position had inspired him with joy and\r\nhope. Already in anticipation he had seen a brighter day dawning for the\r\nchurch. But encouragement had changed to reproach and condemnation. Many\r\ndignitaries, of both church and state, were convicted of the truthfulness\r\nof his theses; but they soon saw that the acceptance of these truths would\r\ninvolve great changes. To enlighten and reform the people would be\r\nvirtually to undermine the authority of Rome, to stop thousands of streams\r\nnow flowing into her treasury, and thus greatly to curtail the\r\nextravagance and luxury of the papal leaders. Furthermore, to teach the\r\npeople to think and act as responsible beings, looking to Christ alone for\r\nsalvation, would overthrow the pontiff’s throne, and eventually destroy\r\ntheir own authority. For this reason they refused the knowledge tendered\r\nthem of God, and arrayed themselves against Christ and the truth by their\r\nopposition to the man whom He had sent to enlighten them.\r\n\r\nLuther trembled as he looked upon himself—one man opposed to the mightiest\r\npowers of earth. He sometimes doubted whether he had indeed been led of\r\nGod to set himself against the authority of the church. “Who was I,” he\r\nwrites, “to oppose the majesty of the pope, before whom ... the kings of\r\nthe earth and the whole world trembled? ... No one can know what my heart\r\nsuffered during these first two years, and into what despondency, I may\r\nsay into what despair, I was sunk.”(177) But he was not left to become\r\nutterly disheartened. When human support failed, he looked to God alone,\r\nand learned that he could lean in perfect safety upon that all-powerful\r\narm.\r\n\r\nTo a friend of the Reformation Luther wrote: “We cannot attain to the\r\nunderstanding of Scripture either by study or by the intellect. Your first\r\nduty is to begin by prayer. Entreat the Lord to grant you, of His great\r\nmercy, the true understanding of His word. There is no other interpreter\r\nof the word of God than the Author of this word, as He Himself has said,\r\n‘They shall be all taught of God.’ Hope for nothing from your own labors,\r\nfrom your own understanding: trust solely in God, and in the influence of\r\nHis Spirit. Believe this on the word of a man who has had\r\nexperience.”(178) Here is a lesson of vital importance to those who feel\r\nthat God has called them to present to others the solemn truths for this\r\ntime. These truths will stir the enmity of Satan, and of men who love the\r\nfables that he has devised. In the conflict with the powers of evil, there\r\nis need of something more than strength of intellect and human wisdom.\r\n\r\nWhen enemies appealed to custom and tradition, or to the assertions and\r\nauthority of the pope, Luther met them with the Bible, and the Bible only.\r\nHere were arguments which they could not answer; therefore the slaves of\r\nformalism and superstition clamored for his blood, as the Jews had\r\nclamored for the blood of Christ. “He is a heretic,” cried the Roman\r\nzealots. “It is high treason against the church to allow so horrible a\r\nheretic to live one hour longer. Let the scaffold be instantly erected for\r\nhim!”(179) But Luther did not fall a prey to their fury. God had a work\r\nfor him to do, and angels of heaven were sent to protect him. Many,\r\nhowever, who had received from Luther the precious light, were made the\r\nobjects of Satan’s wrath, and for the truth’s sake fearlessly suffered\r\ntorture and death.\r\n\r\nLuther’s teachings attracted the attention of thoughtful minds throughout\r\nall Germany. From his sermons and writings issued beams of light which\r\nawakened and illuminated thousands. A living faith was taking the place of\r\nthe dead formalism in which the church had so long been held. The people\r\nwere daily losing confidence in the superstitions of Romanism. The\r\nbarriers of prejudice were giving way. The word of God, by which Luther\r\ntested every doctrine and every claim, was like a two-edged sword, cutting\r\nits way to the hearts of the people. Everywhere there was awakening a\r\ndesire for spiritual progress. Everywhere was such a hungering and\r\nthirsting after righteousness as had not been known for ages. The eyes of\r\nthe people, so long directed to human rites and earthly mediators, were\r\nnow turning in penitence and faith to Christ and Him crucified.\r\n\r\nThis wide-spread interest aroused still further the fears of the papal\r\nauthorities. Luther received a summons to appear at Rome, to answer to the\r\ncharge of heresy. The command filled his friends with terror. They knew\r\nfull well the danger that threatened him in that corrupt city, already\r\ndrunk with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. They protested against his\r\ngoing to Rome, and requested that he receive his examination in Germany.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement was finally effected, and the pope’s legate was appointed\r\nto hear the case. In the instructions communicated by the pontiff to this\r\nofficial, it was stated that Luther had already been declared a heretic.\r\nThe legate was therefore charged “to prosecute and constrain without any\r\ndelay.” If he should remain steadfast, and the legate should fail to gain\r\npossession of his person, he was empowered “to proscribe him in every part\r\nof Germany; to banish, curse, and excommunicate all those who are attached\r\nto him.”(180) And further, the pope directed his legate, in order entirely\r\nto root out the pestilent heresy, to excommunicate all, of whatever\r\ndignity in church or state, except the emperor, who should neglect to\r\nseize Luther and his adherents, and deliver them up to the vengeance of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nHere is displayed the true spirit of popery. Not a trace of Christian\r\nprinciple, or even of common justice, is to be seen in the whole document.\r\nLuther was at a great distance from Rome; he had had no opportunity to\r\nexplain or defend his position; yet before his case had been investigated,\r\nhe was summarily pronounced a heretic, and in the same day, exhorted,\r\naccused, judged, and condemned; and all this by the self-styled holy\r\nfather, the only supreme, infallible authority in church or state!\r\n\r\nAt this time, when Luther so much needed the sympathy and counsel of a\r\ntrue friend, God’s providence sent Melanchthon to Wittenberg. Young in\r\nyears, modest and diffident in his manners, Melanchthon’s sound judgment,\r\nextensive knowledge, and winning eloquence, combined with the purity and\r\nuprightness of his character, won universal admiration and esteem. The\r\nbrilliancy of his talents was not more marked than his gentleness of\r\ndisposition. He soon became an earnest disciple of the gospel, and\r\nLuther’s most trusted friend and valued supporter; his gentleness,\r\ncaution, and exactness serving as a complement to Luther’s courage and\r\nenergy. Their union in the work added strength to the Reformation, and was\r\na source of great encouragement to Luther.\r\n\r\nAugsburg had been fixed upon as the place of trial, and the Reformer set\r\nout on foot to perform the journey thither. Serious fears were entertained\r\nin his behalf. Threats had been made openly that he would be seized and\r\nmurdered on the way, and his friends begged him not to venture. They even\r\nentreated him to leave Wittenberg for a time, and find safety with those\r\nwho would gladly protect him. But he would not leave the position where\r\nGod had placed him. He must continue faithfully to maintain the truth,\r\nnotwithstanding the storms that were beating upon him. His language was:\r\n“I am like Jeremiah, a man of strife and contention; but the more their\r\nthreats increase, the more my joy is multiplied.... They have already\r\ndestroyed my honor and my reputation. One single thing remains; it is my\r\nwretched body: let them take it; they will thus shorten my life by a few\r\nhours. But as for my soul, they cannot take that. He who desires to\r\nproclaim the word of Christ to the world, must expect death at every\r\nmoment.”(181)\r\n\r\nThe tidings of Luther’s arrival at Augsburg gave great satisfaction to the\r\npapal legate. The troublesome heretic who was exciting the attention of\r\nthe whole world seemed now in the power of Rome, and the legate determined\r\nthat he should not escape. The Reformer had failed to provide himself with\r\na safe-conduct. His friends urged him not to appear before the legate\r\nwithout one, and they themselves undertook to procure it from the emperor.\r\nThe legate intended to force Luther, if possible, to retract, or, failing\r\nin this, to cause him to be conveyed to Rome, to share the fate of Huss\r\nand Jerome. Therefore through his agents he endeavored to induce Luther to\r\nappear without a safe-conduct, trusting himself to his mercy. This the\r\nReformer firmly declined to do. Not until he had received the document\r\npledging him the emperor’s protection, did he appear in the presence of\r\nthe papal ambassador.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of policy, the Romanists had decided to attempt to win Luther\r\nby an appearance of gentleness. The legate, in his interviews with him,\r\nprofessed great friendliness; but he demanded that Luther submit\r\nimplicitly to the authority of the church, and yield every point without\r\nargument or question. He had not rightly estimated the character of the\r\nman with whom he had to deal. Luther, in reply, expressed his regard for\r\nthe church, his desire for the truth, his readiness to answer all\r\nobjections to what he had taught, and to submit his doctrines to the\r\ndecision of certain leading universities. But at the same time he\r\nprotested against the cardinal’s course in requiring him to retract\r\nwithout having proved him in error.\r\n\r\nThe only response was, “Retract, retract!” The Reformer showed that his\r\nposition was sustained by the Scriptures, and firmly declared that he\r\ncould not renounce the truth. The legate, unable to reply to Luther’s\r\narguments, overwhelmed him with a storm of reproaches, gibes, and\r\nflattery, interspersed with quotations from tradition and the sayings of\r\nthe Fathers, granting the Reformer no opportunity to speak. Seeing that\r\nthe conference, thus continued, would be utterly futile, Luther finally\r\nobtained a reluctant permission to present his answer in writing.\r\n\r\n“In so doing,” said he, writing to a friend, “the oppressed find double\r\ngain; first, what is written may be submitted to the judgment of others;\r\nand second, one has a better chance of working on the fears, if not on the\r\nconscience, of an arrogant and babbling despot, who would otherwise\r\noverpower by his imperious language.”(182)\r\n\r\nAt the next interview, Luther presented a clear, concise, and forcible\r\nexposition of his views, fully supported by many quotations from\r\nScripture. This paper, after reading aloud, he handed to the cardinal,\r\nwho, however, cast it contemptuously aside, declaring it to be a mass of\r\nidle words and irrelevant quotations. Luther, fully roused, now met the\r\nhaughty prelate on his own ground,—the traditions and teachings of the\r\nchurch,—and utterly overthrew his assumptions.\r\n\r\nWhen the prelate saw that Luther’s reasoning was unanswerable, he lost all\r\nself-control, and in a rage cried out: “Retract! or I will send you to\r\nRome, there to appear before the judges commissioned to take cognizance of\r\nyour cause. I will excommunicate you and all your partisans, and all who\r\nshall at any time countenance you, and will cast them out of the church.”\r\nAnd he finally declared, in a haughty and angry tone, “Retract, or return\r\nno more.”(183)\r\n\r\nThe Reformer promptly withdrew with his friends, thus declaring plainly\r\nthat no retraction was to be expected from him. This was not what the\r\ncardinal had purposed. He had flattered himself that by violence he could\r\nawe Luther to submission. Now, left alone with his supporters, he looked\r\nfrom one to another in utter chagrin at the unexpected failure of his\r\nschemes.\r\n\r\nLuther’s efforts on this occasion were not without good results. The large\r\nassembly present had opportunity to compare the two men, and to judge for\r\nthemselves of the spirit manifested by them, as well as of the strength\r\nand truthfulness of their positions. How marked the contrast! The\r\nReformer, simple, humble, firm, stood up in the strength of God, having\r\ntruth on his side; the pope’s representative, self-important, overbearing,\r\nhaughty, and unreasonable, was without a single argument from the\r\nScriptures, yet vehemently crying, “Retract, or be sent to Rome for\r\npunishment.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Luther had secured a safe-conduct, the Romanists were\r\nplotting to seize and imprison him. His friends urged that as it was\r\nuseless for him to prolong his stay, he should return to Wittenberg\r\nwithout delay, and that the utmost caution should be observed in order to\r\nconceal his intentions. He accordingly left Augsburg before daybreak, on\r\nhorseback, accompanied only by a guide furnished him by the magistrate.\r\nWith many forebodings he secretly made his way through the dark and silent\r\nstreets of the city. Enemies, vigilant and cruel, were plotting his\r\ndestruction. Would he escape the snares prepared for him? Those were\r\nmoments of anxiety and earnest prayer. He reached a small gate in the wall\r\nof the city. It was opened for him, and with his guide he passed through\r\nwithout hindrance. Once safely outside, the fugitives hastened their\r\nflight, and before the legate learned of Luther’s departure, he was beyond\r\nthe reach of his persecutors. Satan and his emissaries were defeated. The\r\nman whom they had thought in their power was gone, escaped as a bird from\r\nthe snare of the fowler.\r\n\r\nAt the news of Luther’s escape, the legate was overwhelmed with surprise\r\nand anger. He had expected to receive great honor for his wisdom and\r\nfirmness in dealing with this disturber of the church; but his hope was\r\ndisappointed. He gave expression to his wrath in a letter to Frederick,\r\nthe elector of Saxony, bitterly denouncing Luther, and demanding that\r\nFrederick send the Reformer to Rome or banish him from Saxony.\r\n\r\nIn defense, Luther urged that the legate or the pope show him his errors\r\nfrom the Scriptures, and pledged himself in the most solemn manner to\r\nrenounce his doctrines if they could be shown to contradict the word of\r\nGod. And he expressed his gratitude to God that he had been counted worthy\r\nto suffer in so holy a cause.\r\n\r\nThe elector had, as yet, little knowledge of the reformed doctrines, but\r\nhe was deeply impressed by the candor, force, and clearness of Luther’s\r\nwords; and until the Reformer should be proved to be in error, Frederick\r\nresolved to stand as his protector. In reply to the legate’s demand he\r\nwrote: “ ‘Since Doctor Martin has appeared before you at Augsburg, you\r\nshould be satisfied. We did not expect that you would endeavor to make him\r\nretract without having convinced him of his errors. None of the learned\r\nmen in our principality have informed me that Martin’s doctrine is\r\nimpious, antichristian, or heretical.’ The prince refused, moreover, to\r\nsend Luther to Rome, or to expel him from his states.”(184)\r\n\r\nThe elector saw that there was a general breaking down of the moral\r\nrestraints of society. A great work of reform was needed. The complicated\r\nand expensive arrangements to restrain and punish crime would be\r\nunnecessary if men but acknowledged and obeyed the requirements of God and\r\nthe dictates of an enlightened conscience. He saw that Luther was laboring\r\nto secure this object, and he secretly rejoiced that a better influence\r\nwas making itself felt in the church.\r\n\r\nHe saw also that as a professor in the university Luther was eminently\r\nsuccessful. Only a year had passed since the Reformer posted his theses on\r\nthe castle church, yet there was already a great falling off in the number\r\nof pilgrims that visited the church at the festival of All Saints. Rome\r\nhad been deprived of worshipers and offerings, but their place was filled\r\nby another class, who now came to Wittenberg, not pilgrims to adore her\r\nrelics, but students to fill her halls of learning. The writings of Luther\r\nhad kindled everywhere a new interest in the Holy Scriptures, and not only\r\nfrom all parts of Germany, but from other lands, students flocked to the\r\nuniversity. Young men, coming in sight of Wittenberg for the first time,\r\n“raised their hands to heaven, and praised God for having caused the light\r\nof truth to shine forth from this city, as from Zion in times of old, and\r\nwhence it spread even to the most distant countries.”(185)\r\n\r\nLuther was as yet but partially converted from the errors of Romanism. But\r\nas he compared the Holy Oracles with the papal decrees and constitutions,\r\nhe was filled with wonder. “I am reading,” he wrote, “the decrees of the\r\npontiffs, and ... I do not know whether the pope is antichrist himself, or\r\nhis apostle, so greatly is Christ misrepresented and crucified in\r\nthem.”(186) Yet at this time Luther was still a supporter of the Roman\r\nChurch, and had no thought that he would ever separate from her communion.\r\n\r\nThe Reformer’s writings and his doctrine were extending to every nation in\r\nChristendom. The work spread to Switzerland and Holland. Copies of his\r\nwritings found their way to France and Spain. In England his teachings\r\nwere received as the word of life. To Belgium and Italy also the truth had\r\nextended. Thousands were awakening from their deathlike stupor to the joy\r\nand hope of a life of faith.\r\n\r\nRome became more and more exasperated by the attacks of Luther, and it was\r\ndeclared by some of his fanatical opponents, even by doctors in Catholic\r\nuniversities, that he who should kill the rebellious monk would be without\r\nsin. One day a stranger, with a pistol hidden under his cloak, approached\r\nthe Reformer, and inquired why he went thus alone. “I am in God’s hands,”\r\nanswered Luther. “He is my strength and my shield. What can man do unto\r\nme?”(187) Upon hearing these words, the stranger turned pale, and fled\r\naway, as from the presence of the angels of heaven.\r\n\r\nRome was bent upon the destruction of Luther; but God was his defense. His\r\ndoctrines were heard everywhere,—“in cottages and convents, ... in the\r\ncastles of the nobles, in the universities, and in the palaces of kings;”\r\nand noble men were rising on every hand to sustain his efforts.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Luther, reading the works of Huss, found that\r\nthe great truth of justification by faith, which he himself was seeking to\r\nuphold and teach, had been held by the Bohemian Reformer. “We have all,”\r\nsaid Luther, “Paul, Augustine, and myself, been Hussites without knowing\r\nit!” “God will surely visit it upon the world,” he continued, “that the\r\ntruth was preached to it a century ago, and burned!”(188)\r\n\r\nIn an appeal to the emperor and nobility of Germany in behalf of the\r\nReformation of Christianity, Luther wrote concerning the pope: “It is a\r\nhorrible thing to behold the man who styles himself Christ’s vicegerent,\r\ndisplaying a magnificence that no emperor can equal. Is this being like\r\nthe poor Jesus, or the humble Peter? He is, say they, the lord of the\r\nworld! But Christ, whose vicar he boasts of being, has said, ‘My kingdom\r\nis not of this world.’ Can the dominions of a vicar extend beyond those of\r\nhis superior?”(189)\r\n\r\nHe wrote thus of the universities: “I am much afraid that the universities\r\nwill prove to be the great gates of hell, unless they diligently labor in\r\nexplaining the Holy Scriptures, and engraving them in the hearts of youth.\r\nI advise no one to place his child where the Scriptures do not reign\r\nparamount. Every institution in which men are not unceasingly occupied\r\nwith the word of God must become corrupt.”(190)\r\n\r\nThis appeal was rapidly circulated throughout Germany, and exerted a\r\npowerful influence upon the people. The whole nation was stirred, and\r\nmultitudes were roused to rally around the standard of reform. Luther’s\r\nopponents, burning with a desire for revenge, urged the pope to take\r\ndecisive measures against him. It was decreed that his doctrines should be\r\nimmediately condemned. Sixty days were granted the Reformer and his\r\nadherents, after which, if they did not recant, they were all to be\r\nexcommunicated.\r\n\r\nThat was a terrible crisis for the Reformation. For centuries Rome’s\r\nsentence of excommunication had struck terror to powerful monarchs; it had\r\nfilled mighty empires with woe and desolation. Those upon whom its\r\ncondemnation fell, were universally regarded with dread and horror; they\r\nwere cut off from intercourse with their fellows, and treated as outlaws,\r\nto be hunted to extermination. Luther was not blind to the tempest about\r\nto burst upon him; but he stood firm, trusting in Christ to be his support\r\nand shield. With a martyr’s faith and courage he wrote: “What is about to\r\nhappen I know not, nor do I care to know.... Let the blow light where it\r\nmay, I am without fear. Not so much as a leaf falls, without the will of\r\nour Father. How much rather will He care for us! It is a light thing to\r\ndie for the Word, since the Word which was made flesh hath Himself died.\r\nIf we die with Him, we shall live with Him; and passing through that which\r\nHe has passed through before us, we shall be where He is and dwell with\r\nHim forever.”(191)\r\n\r\nWhen the papal bull reached Luther, he said: “I despise and attack it, as\r\nimpious, false.... It is _Christ_ Himself who is condemned therein.... I\r\nrejoice in having to bear such ills for the best of causes. Already I feel\r\ngreater liberty in my heart; for at last I know that the pope is\r\nantichrist, and that his throne is that of Satan himself.”(192)\r\n\r\nYet the mandate of Rome was not without effect. Prison, torture, and sword\r\nwere weapons potent to enforce obedience. The weak and superstitious\r\ntrembled before the decree of the pope; and while there was general\r\nsympathy for Luther, many felt that life was too dear to be risked in the\r\ncause of reform. Everything seemed to indicate that the Reformer’s work\r\nwas about to close.\r\n\r\nBut Luther was fearless still. Rome had hurled her anathemas against him,\r\nand the world looked on, nothing doubting that he would perish or be\r\nforced to yield. But with terrible power he flung back upon herself the\r\nsentence of condemnation, and publicly declared his determination to\r\nabandon her forever. In the presence of a crowd of students, doctors, and\r\ncitizens of all ranks, Luther burned the pope’s bull, with the canon laws,\r\nthe decretals, and certain writings sustaining the papal power. “My\r\nenemies have been able, by burning my books,” he said, “to injure the\r\ncause of truth in the minds of the common people, and destroy their souls;\r\nfor this reason I consumed their books in return. A serious struggle has\r\njust begun. Hitherto I have been only playing with the pope. I began this\r\nwork in God’s name; it will be ended without me, and by His might.”(193)\r\n\r\nTo the reproaches of his enemies who taunted him with the weakness of his\r\ncause, Luther answered: “Who knows if God has not chosen and called me,\r\nand if they ought not to fear that, by despising me, they despise God\r\nHimself? Moses was alone at the departure from Egypt; Elijah was alone in\r\nthe reign of King Ahab; Isaiah alone in Jerusalem; Ezekiel alone in\r\nBabylon.... God never selected as a prophet either the high priest or any\r\nother great personage; but ordinarily He chose low and despised men, once\r\neven the shepherd Amos. In every age, the saints have had to reprove the\r\ngreat, kings, princes, priests, and wise men, at the peril of their\r\nlives.... I do not say that I am a prophet; but I say that they ought to\r\nfear precisely because I am alone and that they are many. I am sure of\r\nthis, that the word of God is with me, and that it is not with them.”(194)\r\n\r\nYet it was not without a terrible struggle with himself that Luther\r\ndecided upon a final separation from the church. It was about this time\r\nthat he wrote: “I feel more and more every day how difficult it is to lay\r\naside the scruples which one has imbibed in childhood. O, how much pain it\r\nhas caused me, though I had the Scriptures on my side, to justify it to\r\nmyself that I should dare to make a stand alone against the pope, and hold\r\nhim forth as antichrist! What have the tribulations of my heart not been!\r\nHow many times have I not asked myself with bitterness that question which\r\nwas so frequent on the lips of the papists: ‘Art thou alone wise? Can\r\nevery one else be mistaken? How will it be, if, after all, it is thyself\r\nwho art wrong, and who art involving in thy error so many souls, who will\r\nthen be eternally damned?’ ’Twas so I fought with myself and with Satan,\r\ntill Christ, by His own infallible word, fortified my heart against these\r\ndoubts.”(195)\r\n\r\nThe pope had threatened Luther with excommunication if he did not recant,\r\nand the threat was now fulfilled. A new bull appeared, declaring the\r\nReformer’s final separation from the Roman Church, denouncing him as\r\naccursed of Heaven, and including in the same condemnation all who should\r\nreceive his doctrines. The great contest had been fully entered upon.\r\n\r\nOpposition is the lot of all whom God employs to present truths specially\r\napplicable to their time. There was a present truth in the days of\r\nLuther,—a truth at that time of special importance; there is a present\r\ntruth for the church to-day. He who does all things according to the\r\ncounsel of His will, has been pleased to place men under various\r\ncircumstances, and to enjoin upon them duties peculiar to the times in\r\nwhich they live, and the conditions under which they are placed. If they\r\nwould prize the light given them, broader views of truth would be opened\r\nbefore them. But truth is no more desired by the majority to-day than it\r\nwas by the papists who opposed Luther. There is the same disposition to\r\naccept the theories and traditions of men instead of the word of God as in\r\nformer ages. Those who present the truth for this time should not expect\r\nto be received with greater favor than were earlier reformers. The great\r\ncontroversy between truth and error, between Christ and Satan, is to\r\nincrease in intensity to the close of this world’s history.\r\n\r\nSaid Jesus to His disciples: “If ye were of the world, the world would\r\nlove his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you\r\nout of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I\r\nsaid unto you, The servant is not greater than his Lord. If they have\r\npersecuted Me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept My saying,\r\nthey will keep yours also.”(196) And on the other hand our Lord declared\r\nplainly: “Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did\r\ntheir fathers to the false prophets.”(197) The spirit of the world is no\r\nmore in harmony with the spirit of Christ to-day than in earlier times;\r\nand those who preach the word of God in its purity will be received with\r\nno greater favor now than then. The forms of opposition to the truth may\r\nchange, the enmity may be less open because it is more subtle; but the\r\nsame antagonism still exists, and will be manifested to the end of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. LUTHER BEFORE THE DIET.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nA new emperor, Charles V., had ascended the throne of Germany, and the\r\nemissaries of Rome hastened to present their congratulations, and induce\r\nthe monarch to employ his power against the Reformation. On the other\r\nhand, the elector of Saxony, to whom Charles was in great degree indebted\r\nfor his crown, entreated him to take no step against Luther until he\r\nshould have granted him a hearing. The emperor was thus placed in a\r\nposition of great perplexity and embarrassment. The papists would be\r\nsatisfied with nothing short of an imperial edict sentencing Luther to\r\ndeath. The elector had declared firmly that “neither his imperial majesty\r\nnor any other person had shown that Luther’s writings had been refuted;”\r\ntherefore he requested “that Doctor Luther should be furnished with a\r\nsafe-conduct, so that he might appear before a tribunal of learned, pious,\r\nand impartial judges.”(198)\r\n\r\nThe attention of all parties was now directed to the assembly of the\r\nGerman states which convened at Worms soon after the accession of Charles\r\nto the empire. There were important political questions and interests to\r\nbe considered by this national council; for the first time the princes of\r\nGermany were to meet their youthful monarch in deliberative assembly. From\r\nall parts of the fatherland had come the dignitaries of church and state.\r\nSecular lords, high-born, powerful, and jealous of their hereditary\r\nrights; princely ecclesiastics, flushed with their conscious superiority\r\nin rank and power; courtly knights and their armed retainers; and\r\nambassadors from foreign and distant lands,—all gathered at Worms. Yet in\r\nthat vast assembly the subject that excited the deepest interest, was the\r\ncause of the Saxon Reformer.\r\n\r\nCharles had previously directed the elector to bring Luther with him to\r\nthe Diet, assuring him of protection, and promising a free discussion,\r\nwith competent persons, of the questions in dispute. Luther was anxious to\r\nappear before the emperor. His health was at this time much impaired; yet\r\nhe wrote to the elector: “If I cannot go to Worms in good health, I will\r\nbe carried there, sick as I am. For if the emperor calls me, I cannot\r\ndoubt that it is the call of God Himself. If they desire to use violence\r\nagainst me, and that is very probable (for it is not for their instruction\r\nthat they order me to appear), I place the matter in the Lord’s hands. He\r\nstill lives and reigns who preserved the three young men in the burning\r\nfiery furnace. If He will not save me, my life is of little consequence.\r\nLet us only prevent the gospel from being exposed to the scorn of the\r\nwicked, and let us shed our blood for it, for fear they should triumph. It\r\nis not for me to decide whether my life or my death will contribute most\r\nto the salvation of all.... You may expect everything from me ... except\r\nflight and recantation. Fly I cannot, and still less retract.”(199)\r\n\r\nAs the news was circulated at Worms that Luther was to appear before the\r\nDiet, a general excitement was created. Aleander, the papal legate to whom\r\nthe case had been specially intrusted, was alarmed and enraged. He saw\r\nthat the result would be disastrous to the papal cause. To institute\r\ninquiry into a case in which the pope had already pronounced sentence of\r\ncondemnation, would be to cast contempt upon the authority of the\r\nsovereign pontiff. Furthermore, he was apprehensive that the eloquent and\r\npowerful arguments of this man might turn away many of the princes from\r\nthe cause of the pope. He therefore, in the most urgent manner,\r\nremonstrated with Charles against Luther’s appearance at Worms. About this\r\ntime the bull declaring Luther’s excommunication was published; and this,\r\ncoupled with the representations of the legate, induced the emperor to\r\nyield. He wrote to the elector that if Luther would not retract, he must\r\nremain at Wittenberg.\r\n\r\nNot content with this victory, Aleander labored with all the power and\r\ncunning at his command to secure Luther’s condemnation. With a persistence\r\nworthy of a better cause, he urged the matter upon the attention of\r\nprinces, prelates, and other members of the assembly, accusing the\r\nReformer of “sedition, rebellion, impiety, and blasphemy.” But the\r\nvehemence and passion manifested by the legate revealed too plainly the\r\nspirit by which he was actuated. “He is moved by hatred and vengeance,”\r\nwas the general remark, “much more than by zeal and piety.”(200) The\r\nmajority of the Diet were more than ever inclined to regard Luther’s cause\r\nwith favor.\r\n\r\nWith redoubled zeal, Aleander urged upon the emperor the duty of executing\r\nthe papal edicts. But under the laws of Germany this could not be done\r\nwithout the concurrence of the princes; and overcome at last by the\r\nlegate’s importunity, Charles bade him present his case to the Diet. “It\r\nwas a proud day for the nuncio. The assembly was a great one: the cause\r\nwas even greater. Aleander was to plead for Rome, ... the mother and\r\nmistress of all churches.” He was to vindicate the princedom of Peter\r\nbefore the assembled principalities of Christendom. “He had the gift of\r\neloquence, and he rose to the greatness of the occasion. Providence\r\nordered it that Rome should appear and plead by the ablest of her orators\r\nin the presence of the most august of tribunals, before she was\r\ncondemned.”(201) With some misgivings those who favored the Reformer\r\nlooked forward to the effect of Aleander’s speech. The elector of Saxony\r\nwas not present, but by his direction some of his councilors attended, to\r\ntake notes of the nuncio’s address.\r\n\r\nWith all the power of learning and eloquence, Aleander set himself to\r\noverthrow the truth. Charge after charge he hurled against Luther as an\r\nenemy of the church and the state, the living and the dead, clergy and\r\nlaity, councils and private Christians. “In Luther’s errors there is\r\nenough,” he declared, to warrant the burning of “a hundred thousand\r\nheretics.”\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, he endeavored to cast contempt upon the adherents of the\r\nreformed faith: “What are all these Lutherans? A crew of insolent\r\npedagogues, corrupt priests, dissolute monks, ignorant lawyers, and\r\ndegraded nobles, with the common people whom they have misled and\r\nperverted. How far superior to them is the Catholic party in number,\r\nability, and power! A unanimous decree from this illustrious assembly will\r\nenlighten the simple, warn the imprudent, decide the waverers, and give\r\nstrength to the weak.”(202)\r\n\r\nWith such weapons the advocates of truth in every age have been attacked.\r\nThe same arguments are still urged against all who dare to present, in\r\nopposition to established errors, the plain and direct teachings of God’s\r\nword. “Who are these preachers of new doctrines?” exclaim those who desire\r\na popular religion. “They are unlearned, few in numbers, and of the poorer\r\nclass. Yet they claim to have the truth, and to be the chosen people of\r\nGod. They are ignorant and deceived. How greatly superior in numbers and\r\ninfluence is our church! How many great and learned men are among us! How\r\nmuch more power is on our side!” These are the arguments that have a\r\ntelling influence upon the world; but they are no more conclusive now than\r\nin the days of the Reformer.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation did not, as many suppose, end with Luther. It is to be\r\ncontinued to the close of this world’s history. Luther had a great work to\r\ndo in reflecting to others the light which God had permitted to shine upon\r\nhim; yet he did not receive all the light which was to be given to the\r\nworld. From that time to this, new light has been continually shining upon\r\nthe Scriptures, and new truths have been constantly unfolding.\r\n\r\nThe legate’s address made a deep impression upon the Diet. There was no\r\nLuther present, with the clear and convincing truths of God’s word, to\r\nvanquish the papal champion. No attempt was made to defend the Reformer.\r\nThere was manifest a general disposition not only to condemn him and the\r\ndoctrines which he taught, but if possible to uproot the heresy. Rome had\r\nenjoyed the most favorable opportunity to defend her cause. All that she\r\ncould say in her own vindication had been said. But the apparent victory\r\nwas the signal of defeat. Henceforth the contrast between truth and error\r\nwould be more clearly seen, as they should take the field in open warfare.\r\nNever from that day would Rome stand as secure as she had stood.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the members of the Diet would not have hesitated to yield up\r\nLuther to the vengeance of Rome, many of them saw and deplored the\r\nexisting depravity in the church, and desired a suppression of the abuses\r\nsuffered by the German people in consequence of the corruption and greed\r\nof the hierarchy. The legate had presented the papal rule in the most\r\nfavorable light. Now the Lord moved upon a member of the Diet to give a\r\ntrue delineation of the effects of papal tyranny. With noble firmness,\r\nDuke George of Saxony stood up in that princely assembly, and specified\r\nwith terrible exactness the deceptions and abominations of popery, and\r\ntheir dire results. In closing he said:\r\n\r\n“These are some of the abuses that cry out against Rome. All shame has\r\nbeen put aside, and their only object is ... money, money, money, ... so\r\nthat the preachers who should teach the truth, utter nothing but\r\nfalsehoods, and are not only tolerated, but rewarded, because the greater\r\ntheir lies, the greater their gain. It is from this foul spring that such\r\ntainted waters flow. Debauchery stretches out the hand to avarice....\r\nAlas, it is the scandal caused by the clergy that hurls so many poor souls\r\ninto eternal condemnation. A general reform must be effected.”(203)\r\n\r\nA more able and forcible denunciation of the papal abuses could not have\r\nbeen presented by Luther himself; and the fact that the speaker was a\r\ndetermined enemy of the Reformer, gave greater influence to his words.\r\n\r\nHad the eyes of the assembly been opened, they would have beheld angels of\r\nGod in the midst of them, shedding beams of light athwart the darkness of\r\nerror, and opening minds and hearts to the reception of truth. It was the\r\npower of the God of truth and wisdom that controlled even the adversaries\r\nof the Reformation, and thus prepared the way for the great work about to\r\nbe accomplished. Martin Luther was not present; but the voice of One\r\ngreater than Luther had been heard in that assembly.\r\n\r\nA committee was at once appointed by the Diet to prepare an enumeration of\r\nthe papal oppressions that weighed so heavily on the German people. This\r\nlist, containing a hundred and one specifications, was presented to the\r\nemperor, with a request that he would take immediate measures for the\r\ncorrection of these abuses. “What a loss of Christian souls,” said the\r\npetitioners, “what depredations, what extortions, on account of the\r\nscandals by which the spiritual head of Christendom is surrounded! It is\r\nour duty to prevent the ruin and dishonor of our people. For this reason\r\nwe most humbly but most urgently entreat you to order a general\r\nreformation, and to undertake its accomplishment.”(204)\r\n\r\nThe council now demanded the Reformer’s appearance before them.\r\nNotwithstanding the entreaties, protests, and threats of Aleander, the\r\nemperor at last consented, and Luther was summoned to appear before the\r\nDiet. With the summons was issued a safe-conduct, insuring his return to a\r\nplace of security. These were borne to Wittenberg by a herald, who was\r\ncommissioned to conduct him to Worms.\r\n\r\nThe friends of Luther were terrified and distressed. Knowing the prejudice\r\nand enmity against him, they feared that even his safe-conduct would not\r\nbe respected, and they entreated him not to imperil his life. He replied:\r\n“The papists do not desire my coming to Worms, but my condemnation and my\r\ndeath. It matters not. Pray not for me, but for the word of God.... Christ\r\nwill give me His Spirit to overcome these ministers of error. I despise\r\nthem during my life; I shall triumph over them by my death. They are busy\r\nat Worms about compelling me to retract; and this shall be my retraction:\r\nI said formerly that the pope was Christ’s vicar; now I assert that he is\r\nour Lord’s adversary, and the devil’s apostle.”(205)\r\n\r\nLuther was not to make his perilous journey alone. Besides the imperial\r\nmessenger, three of his firmest friends determined to accompany him.\r\nMelanchthon earnestly desired to join them. His heart was knit to\r\nLuther’s, and he yearned to follow him, if need be, to prison or to death.\r\nBut his entreaties were denied. Should Luther perish, the hopes of the\r\nReformation must center upon his youthful co-laborer. Said the Reformer as\r\nhe parted from Melanchthon: “If I do not return, and my enemies put me to\r\ndeath, continue to teach, and stand fast in the truth. Labor in my\r\nstead.... If you survive, my death will be of little consequence.”(206)\r\nStudents and citizens who had gathered to witness Luther’s departure were\r\ndeeply moved. A multitude whose hearts had been touched by the gospel,\r\nbade him farewell with weeping. Thus the Reformer and his companions set\r\nout from Wittenberg.\r\n\r\nOn the journey they saw that the minds of the people were oppressed by\r\ngloomy forebodings. At some towns no honors were proffered them. As they\r\nstopped for the night, a friendly priest expressed his fears by holding up\r\nbefore Luther the portrait of an Italian reformer who had suffered\r\nmartyrdom. The next day they learned that Luther’s writings had been\r\ncondemned at Worms. Imperial messengers were proclaiming the emperor’s\r\ndecree, and calling upon the people to bring the proscribed works to the\r\nmagistrates. The herald, fearing for Luther’s safety at the council, and\r\nthinking that already his resolution might be shaken, asked if he still\r\nwished to go forward. He answered, “Although interdicted in every city, I\r\nshall go on.”(207)\r\n\r\nAt Erfurt, Luther was received with honor. Surrounded by admiring crowds,\r\nhe passed through the streets that he had often traversed with his\r\nbeggar’s wallet. He visited his convent cell, and thought upon the\r\nstruggles through which the light now flooding Germany had been shed upon\r\nhis soul. He was urged to preach. This he had been forbidden to do, but\r\nthe herald granted him permission, and the friar who had once been made\r\nthe drudge of the convent, now entered the pulpit.\r\n\r\nTo a crowded assembly he spoke from the words of Christ, “Peace be unto\r\nyou.” “Philosophers, doctors, and writers,” he said, “have endeavored to\r\nteach men the way to obtain everlasting life, and they have not succeeded.\r\nI will now tell it to you.... God has raised one Man from the dead, the\r\nLord Jesus Christ, that He might destroy death, extirpate sin, and shut\r\nthe gates of hell. This is the work of salvation.... Christ has\r\nvanquished! this is the joyful news; and we are saved by His work, and not\r\nby our own.... Our Lord Jesus Christ said, ‘Peace be unto you; behold My\r\nhands;’ that is to say, Behold, O man! it is I, I alone, who have taken\r\naway thy sin, and ransomed thee; and now thou hast peace, saith the Lord.”\r\n\r\nHe continued, showing that true faith will be manifested by a holy life.\r\n“Since God has saved us, let us so order our works that they may be\r\nacceptable to Him. Art thou rich? let thy goods administer to the\r\nnecessities of the poor. Art thou poor? let thy services be acceptable to\r\nthe rich. If thy labor is useful to thyself alone, the service that thou\r\npretendest to render unto God is a lie.”(208)\r\n\r\nThe people listened as if spellbound. The bread of life was broken to\r\nthose starving souls. Christ was lifted up before them as above popes,\r\nlegates, emperors, and kings. Luther made no reference to his own perilous\r\nposition. He did not seek to make himself the object of thought or\r\nsympathy. In the contemplation of Christ, he had lost sight of self. He\r\nhid behind the Man of Calvary, seeking only to present Jesus as the\r\nsinner’s Redeemer.\r\n\r\nAs the Reformer proceeded on his journey, he was everywhere regarded with\r\ngreat interest. An eager multitude thronged about him, and friendly voices\r\nwarned him of the purpose of the Romanists. “They will burn you,” said\r\nsome, “and reduce your body to ashes, as they did with John Huss.” Luther\r\nanswered, “Though they should kindle a fire all the way from Worms to\r\nWittenberg, the flames of which reached to heaven, I would walk through it\r\nin the name of the Lord; I would appear before them; I would enter the\r\njaws of this behemoth, and break his teeth, confessing the Lord Jesus\r\nChrist.”(209)\r\n\r\nThe news of his approach to Worms created great commotion. His friends\r\ntrembled for his safety; his enemies feared for the success of their\r\ncause. Strenuous efforts were made to dissuade him from entering the city.\r\nAt the instigation of the papists he was urged to repair to the castle of\r\na friendly knight, where, it was declared, all difficulties could be\r\namicably adjusted. Friends endeavored to excite his fears by describing\r\nthe dangers that threatened him. All their efforts failed; Luther, still\r\nunshaken, declared, “Even should there be as many devils in Worms as tiles\r\non the housetops, still I would enter it.”(210)\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival at Worms, a vast crowd flocked to the gates to welcome\r\nhim. So great a concourse had not assembled to greet the emperor himself.\r\nThe excitement was intense, and from the midst of the throng a shrill and\r\nplaintive voice chanted a funeral dirge, as a warning to Luther of the\r\nfate that awaited him. “God will be my defense,” said he, as he alighted\r\nfrom his carriage.\r\n\r\nThe papists had not believed that Luther would really venture to appear at\r\nWorms, and his arrival filled them with consternation. The emperor\r\nimmediately summoned his councilors to consider what course should be\r\npursued. One of the bishops, a rigid papist, declared: “We have long\r\nconsulted on this matter. Let your imperial majesty get rid of this man at\r\nonce. Did not Sigismund cause John Huss to be burnt? We are not bound\r\neither to give or to observe the safe-conduct of a heretic.” “No,” said\r\nthe emperor; “we must keep our promise.”(211) It was therefore decided\r\nthat the Reformer should be heard.\r\n\r\nAll the city were eager to see this remarkable man, and a throng of\r\nvisitors soon filled his lodgings. Luther had scarcely recovered from his\r\nrecent illness; he was wearied from the journey, which had occupied two\r\nfull weeks; he must prepare to meet the momentous events of the morrow,\r\nand he needed quiet and repose. But so great was the desire to see him,\r\nthat he had enjoyed only a few hours’ rest, when noblemen, knights,\r\npriests, and citizens gathered eagerly about him. Among these were many of\r\nthe nobles who had so boldly demanded of the emperor a reform of\r\necclesiastical abuses, and who, says Luther, “had all been freed by my\r\ngospel.”(212) Enemies, as well as friends, came to look upon the dauntless\r\nmonk; but he received them with unshaken calmness, replying to all with\r\ndignity and wisdom. His bearing was firm and courageous. His pale, thin\r\nface, marked with the traces of toil and illness, wore a kindly and even\r\njoyous expression. The solemnity and deep earnestness of his words gave\r\nhim a power that even his enemies could not wholly withstand. Both friends\r\nand foes were filled with wonder. Some were convinced that a divine\r\ninfluence attended him; others declared, as had the Pharisees concerning\r\nChrist, “He hath a devil.”\r\n\r\nOn the following day, Luther was summoned to attend the Diet. An imperial\r\nofficer was appointed to conduct him to the hall of audience; yet it was\r\nwith difficulty that he reached the place. Every avenue was crowded with\r\nspectators, eager to look upon the monk who had dared resist the authority\r\nof the pope.\r\n\r\nAs he was about to enter the presence of his judges, an old general, the\r\nhero of many battles, said to him kindly: “Poor monk, poor monk, thou art\r\nnow going to make a nobler stand than I or any other captains have ever\r\nmade in the bloodiest of our battles. But if thy cause is just, and thou\r\nart sure of it, go forward in God’s name, and fear nothing. God will not\r\nforsake thee.”(213)\r\n\r\nAt length Luther stood before the council. The emperor occupied the\r\nthrone. He was surrounded by the most illustrious personages in the\r\nempire. Never had any man appeared in the presence of a more imposing\r\nassembly than that before which Martin Luther was to answer for his faith.\r\n“This appearance was of itself a signal victory over the papacy. The pope\r\nhad condemned the man, and he was now standing before a tribunal which, by\r\nthis very act, set itself above the pope. The pope had laid him under an\r\ninterdict, and cut him off from all human society; and yet he was summoned\r\nin respectful language, and received before the most august assembly in\r\nthe world. The pope had condemned him to perpetual silence, and he was now\r\nabout to speak before thousands of attentive hearers drawn together from\r\nthe farthest parts of Christendom. An immense revolution had thus been\r\neffected by Luther’s instrumentality. Rome was already descending from her\r\nthrone, and it was the voice of a monk that caused this humiliation.”(214)\r\n\r\nIn the presence of that powerful and titled assembly, the lowly-born\r\nReformer seemed awed and embarrassed. Several of the princes, observing\r\nhis emotion, approached him, and one of them whispered, “Fear not them\r\nwhich kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.” Another said,\r\n“When ye shall be brought before governors and kings for My sake, it shall\r\nbe given you, by the Spirit of your Father, what ye shall say.” Thus the\r\nwords of Christ were brought by the world’s great men to strengthen His\r\nservant in the hour of trial.\r\n\r\nLuther was conducted to a position directly in front of the emperor’s\r\nthrone. A deep silence fell upon the crowded assembly. Then an imperial\r\nofficer arose, and pointing to a collection of Luther’s writings, demanded\r\nthat the Reformer answer two questions,—whether he acknowledged them as\r\nhis, and whether he proposed to retract the opinions which he had therein\r\nadvanced. The titles of the books having been read, Luther replied that as\r\nto the first question, he acknowledged the books to be his. “As to the\r\nsecond,” he said, “seeing that it is a question which concerns faith and\r\nthe salvation of souls, and in which the word of God, the greatest and\r\nmost precious treasure either in heaven or earth, is interested, I should\r\nact imprudently were I to reply without reflection. I might affirm less\r\nthan the circumstance demands, or more than truth requires, and so sin\r\nagainst this saying of Christ: ‘Whosoever shall deny Me before men, him\r\nwill I also deny before My Father which is in heaven.’(215) For this\r\nreason I entreat your imperial majesty, with all humility, to allow me\r\ntime, that I may answer without offending against the word of God.”(216)\r\n\r\nIn making this request, Luther moved wisely. His course convinced the\r\nassembly that he did not act from passion or impulse. Such calmness and\r\nself-command, unexpected in one who had shown himself bold and\r\nuncompromising, added to his power, and enabled him afterward to answer\r\nwith a prudence, decision, wisdom, and dignity that surprised and\r\ndisappointed his adversaries, and rebuked their insolence and pride.\r\n\r\nThe next day he was to appear to render his final answer. For a time his\r\nheart sunk within him as he contemplated the forces that were combined\r\nagainst the truth. His faith faltered; fearfulness and trembling came upon\r\nhim, and horror overwhelmed him. Dangers multiplied before him; his\r\nenemies seemed about to triumph, and the powers of darkness to prevail.\r\nClouds gathered about him, and seemed to separate him from God. He longed\r\nfor the assurance that the Lord of hosts would be with him. In anguish of\r\nspirit he threw himself with his face upon the earth, and poured out those\r\nbroken, heart-rending cries, which none but God can fully understand.\r\n\r\n“O almighty and everlasting God,” he pleaded, “how terrible is this world!\r\nBehold, it openeth its mouth to swallow me up, and I have so little trust\r\nin Thee.... If it is only in the strength of this world that I must put my\r\ntrust, all is over.... My last hour is come, my condemnation has been\r\npronounced.... O God, do Thou help me against all the wisdom of the world.\r\nDo this, ... Thou alone; ... for this is not my work, but Thine. I have\r\nnothing to do here, nothing to contend for with these great ones of the\r\nworld.... But the cause is Thine, ... and it is a righteous and eternal\r\ncause. O Lord, help me! Faithful and unchangeable God, in no man do I\r\nplace my trust.... All that is of man is uncertain; all that cometh of man\r\nfails.... Thou hast chosen me for this work.... Stand at my side, for the\r\nsake of Thy well-beloved Jesus Christ, who is my defense, my shield, and\r\nmy strong tower.”(217)\r\n\r\nAn all-wise Providence had permitted Luther to realize his peril, that he\r\nmight not trust to his own strength, and rush presumptuously into danger.\r\nYet it was not the fear of personal suffering, a dread of torture or\r\ndeath, which seemed immediately impending, that overwhelmed him with its\r\nterror. He had come to the crisis, and he felt his insufficiency to meet\r\nit. Through his weakness the cause of truth might suffer loss. Not for his\r\nown safety, but for the triumph of the gospel did he wrestle with God.\r\nLike Israel’s, in that night struggle beside the lonely stream, was the\r\nanguish and conflict of his soul. Like Israel, he prevailed with God. In\r\nhis utter helplessness his faith fastened upon Christ, the mighty\r\ndeliverer. He was strengthened with the assurance that he would not appear\r\nalone before the council. Peace returned to his soul, and he rejoiced that\r\nhe was permitted to uplift the word of God before the rulers of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nWith his mind stayed upon God, Luther prepared for the struggle before\r\nhim. He thought upon the plan of his answer, examined passages in his own\r\nwritings, and drew from the Holy Scriptures suitable proofs to sustain his\r\npositions. Then, laying his left hand on the Sacred Volume, which was open\r\nbefore him, he lifted his right hand to heaven, and vowed “to remain\r\nfaithful to the gospel, and freely to confess his faith, even should he\r\nseal his testimony with his blood.”(218)\r\n\r\nWhen he was again ushered into the presence of the Diet, his countenance\r\nbore no trace of fear or embarrassment. Calm and peaceful, yet grandly\r\nbrave and noble, he stood as God’s witness among the great ones of the\r\nearth. The imperial officer now demanded his decision as to whether he\r\ndesired to retract his doctrines. Luther made his answer in a subdued and\r\nhumble tone, without violence or passion. His demeanor was diffident and\r\nrespectful; yet he manifested a confidence and joy that surprised the\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\n“Most serene emperor, illustrious princes, gracious lords,” said Luther,\r\n“I appear before you this day, in conformity with the order given me\r\nyesterday, and by God’s mercies I conjure your majesty and your august\r\nhighnesses to listen graciously to the defense of a cause which I am\r\nassured is just and true. If, through ignorance, I should transgress the\r\nusages and proprieties of courts, I entreat you to pardon me; for I was\r\nnot brought up in the palaces of kings, but in the seclusion of a\r\nconvent.”(219)\r\n\r\nThen, proceeding to the question, he stated that his published works were\r\nnot all of the same character. In some he had treated of faith and good\r\nworks, and even his enemies declared them not only harmless but\r\nprofitable. To retract these would be to condemn truths which all parties\r\nconfessed. The second class consisted of writings exposing the corruptions\r\nand abuses of the papacy. To revoke these works would strengthen the\r\ntyranny of Rome, and open a wider door to many and great impieties. In the\r\nthird class of his books he had attacked individuals who had defended\r\nexisting evils. Concerning these he freely confessed that he had been more\r\nviolent than was becoming. He did not claim to be free from fault; but\r\neven these books he could not revoke, for such a course would embolden the\r\nenemies of truth, and they would then take occasion to crush God’s people\r\nwith still greater cruelty.\r\n\r\n“Yet I am but a mere man, and not God, he continued; “I shall therefore\r\ndefend myself as Christ did: ‘If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the\r\nevil.’... By the mercy of God, I conjure you, most serene emperor, and\r\nyou, most illustrious princes, and all men of every degree, to prove from\r\nthe writings of the prophets and apostles that I have erred. As soon as I\r\nam convinced of this, I will retract every error, and be the first to lay\r\nhold of my books and throw them into the fire.”\r\n\r\n“What I have just said plainly shows, I hope, that I have carefully\r\nweighed and considered the dangers to which I expose myself; but far from\r\nbeing dismayed, I rejoice to see that the gospel is now, as in former\r\ntimes, a cause of trouble and dissension. This is the character, this is\r\nthe destiny, of the word of God. ‘I came not to send peace on earth, but a\r\nsword,’ said Jesus Christ. God is wonderful and terrible in His counsels;\r\nbeware lest, by presuming to quench dissensions, you should persecute the\r\nholy word of God, and draw down upon yourselves a frightful deluge of\r\ninsurmountable dangers, of present disasters, and eternal desolation.... I\r\nmight quote many examples from the oracles of God. I might speak of the\r\nPharaohs, the kings of Babylon, and those of Israel, whose labors never\r\nmore effectually contributed to their own destruction than when they\r\nsought by counsels, to all appearance most wise, to strengthen their\r\ndominion. ‘God removeth mountains, and they know it not.’ ”(220)\r\n\r\nLuther had spoken in German; he was now requested to repeat the same words\r\nin Latin. Though exhausted by the previous effort, he complied, and again\r\ndelivered his speech, with the same clearness and energy as at the first.\r\nGod’s providence directed in this matter. The minds of many of the princes\r\nwere so blinded by error and superstition that at the first delivery they\r\ndid not see the force of Luther’s reasoning; but the repetition enabled\r\nthem to perceive clearly the points presented.\r\n\r\nThose who stubbornly closed their eyes to the light, and determined not to\r\nbe convinced of the truth, were enraged at the power of Luther’s words. As\r\nhe ceased speaking, the spokesman of the Diet said angrily, “You have not\r\nanswered the question put to you.... You are required to give a clear and\r\nprecise answer.... Will you, or will you not, retract?”\r\n\r\nThe Reformer answered: “Since your most serene majesty and your high\r\nmightinesses require from me a clear, simple, and precise answer, I will\r\ngive you one, and it is this: I cannot submit my faith either to the pope\r\nor to the councils, because it is clear as the day that they have\r\nfrequently erred and contradicted each other. Unless therefore I am\r\nconvinced by the testimony of Scripture or by the clearest reasoning,\r\nunless I am persuaded by means of the passages I have quoted, and unless\r\nthey thus render my conscience bound by the word of God, _I cannot and I\r\nwill not retract_, for it is unsafe for a Christian to speak against his\r\nconscience. Here I stand, I can do no other; may God help me. Amen.”(221)\r\n\r\nThus stood this righteous man, upon the sure foundation of the word of\r\nGod. The light of heaven illuminated his countenance. His greatness and\r\npurity of character, his peace and joy of heart, were manifest to all as\r\nhe testified against the power of error, and witnessed to the superiority\r\nof that faith that overcomes the world.\r\n\r\nThe whole assembly were for a time speechless with amazement. At his first\r\nanswer, Luther had spoken in a low tone, with a respectful, almost\r\nsubmissive bearing. The Romanists had interpreted this as evidence that\r\nhis courage was beginning to fail. They regarded the request for delay as\r\nmerely the prelude to his recantation. Charles himself, noting, half\r\ncontemptuously, the monk’s worn frame, his plain attire, and the\r\nsimplicity of his address, had declared, “This monk will never make a\r\nheretic of me.” The courage and firmness which he now displayed, as well\r\nas the power and clearness of his reasoning, filled all parties with\r\nsurprise. The emperor, moved to admiration, exclaimed, “This monk speaks\r\nwith an intrepid heart and unshaken courage.” Many of the German princes\r\nlooked with pride and joy upon this representative of their nation.\r\n\r\nThe partisans of Rome had been worsted; their cause appeared in a most\r\nunfavorable light. They sought to maintain their power, not by appealing\r\nto the Scriptures, but by a resort to threats, Rome’s unfailing argument.\r\nSaid the spokesman of the Diet, “If you do not retract, the emperor and\r\nthe states of the empire will consult what course to adopt against an\r\nincorrigible heretic.”\r\n\r\nLuther’s friends, who had with great joy listened to his noble defense,\r\ntrembled at these words; but the doctor himself said calmly, “May God be\r\nmy helper, for I can retract nothing.”(222)\r\n\r\nHe was directed to withdraw from the Diet, while the princes consulted\r\ntogether. It was felt that a great crisis had come. Luther’s persistent\r\nrefusal to submit, might affect the history of the church for ages. It was\r\ndecided to give him one more opportunity to retract. For the last time he\r\nwas brought into the assembly. Again the question was put, whether he\r\nwould renounce his doctrines. “I have no other reply to make,” he said,\r\n“than that which I have already made.” It was evident that he could not be\r\ninduced, either by promises or threats, to yield to the mandate of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe papal leaders were chagrined that their power, which had caused kings\r\nand nobles to tremble, should be thus despised by a humble monk; they\r\nlonged to make him feel their wrath by torturing his life away. But\r\nLuther, understanding his danger, had spoken to all with Christian dignity\r\nand calmness. His words had been free from pride, passion, and\r\nmisrepresentation. He had lost sight of himself, and of the great men\r\nsurrounding him, and felt only that he was in the presence of One\r\ninfinitely superior to popes, prelates, kings, and emperors. Christ had\r\nspoken through Luther’s testimony with a power and grandeur that for the\r\ntime inspired both friends and foes with awe and wonder. The Spirit of God\r\nhad been present in that council impressing the hearts of the chiefs of\r\nthe empire. Several of the princes boldly acknowledged the justice of\r\nLuther’s cause. Many were convinced of the truth; but with some the\r\nimpressions received were not lasting. There was another class who did not\r\nat the time express their convictions, but who, having searched the\r\nScriptures for themselves, at a future time became fearless supporters of\r\nthe Reformation.\r\n\r\nThe elector Frederick had looked forward anxiously to Luther’s appearance\r\nbefore the Diet, and with deep emotion he listened to his speech. With joy\r\nand pride he witnessed the doctor’s courage, firmness, and\r\nself-possession, and determined to stand more firmly in his defense. He\r\ncontrasted the parties in contest, and saw that the wisdom of popes,\r\nkings, and prelates had been brought to naught by the power of truth. The\r\npapacy had sustained a defeat which would be felt among all nations and in\r\nall ages.\r\n\r\nAs the legate perceived the effect produced by Luther’s speech, he feared,\r\nas never before, for the security of the Romish power, and resolved to\r\nemploy every means at his command to effect the Reformer’s overthrow. With\r\nall the eloquence and diplomatic skill for which he was so eminently\r\ndistinguished, he represented to the youthful emperor the folly and danger\r\nof sacrificing, in the cause of an insignificant monk, the friendship and\r\nsupport of the powerful see of Rome.\r\n\r\nHis words were not without effect. On the day following Luther’s answer,\r\nCharles caused a message to be presented to the Diet, announcing his\r\ndetermination to carry out the policy of his predecessors to maintain and\r\nprotect the Catholic religion. Since Luther had refused to renounce his\r\nerrors, the most vigorous measures should be employed against him and the\r\nheresies he taught. “A single monk, misled by his own folly, has risen\r\nagainst the faith of Christendom. To stay such impiety, I will sacrifice\r\nmy kingdoms, my treasures, my friends, my body, my blood, my soul, and my\r\nlife. I am about to dismiss the Augustine Luther, forbidding him to cause\r\nthe least disorder among the people; I shall then proceed against him and\r\nhis adherents as contumacious heretics, by excommunication, by interdict,\r\nand by every means calculated to destroy them. I call on the members of\r\nthe states to behave like faithful Christians.”(223) Nevertheless the\r\nemperor declared that Luther’s safe-conduct must be respected, and that\r\nbefore proceedings against him could be instituted, he must be allowed to\r\nreach his home in safety.\r\n\r\nTwo conflicting opinions were now urged by the members of the Diet. The\r\nemissaries and representatives of the pope again demanded that the\r\nReformer’s safe-conduct should be disregarded. “The Rhine,” they said,\r\n“should receive his ashes, as it had received those of John Huss a century\r\nago.”(224) But princes of Germany, though themselves papists and avowed\r\nenemies to Luther, protested against such a breach of public faith, as a\r\nstain upon the honor of the nation. They pointed to the calamities which\r\nhad followed the death of Huss, and declared that they dared not call down\r\nupon Germany, and upon the head of their youthful emperor, a repetition of\r\nthose terrible evils.\r\n\r\nCharles himself, in answer to the base proposal, said, “Though honor and\r\nfaith should be banished from all the world, they ought to find a refuge\r\nin the hearts of princes.”(225) He was still further urged by the most\r\nbitter of Luther’s papal enemies to deal with the Reformer as Sigismund\r\nhad dealt with Huss,—abandon him to the mercies of the church; but\r\nrecalling the scene when Huss in public assembly had pointed to his chains\r\nand reminded the monarch of his plighted faith, Charles V. declared, “I\r\nshould not like to blush like Sigismund.”(226)\r\n\r\nYet Charles had deliberately rejected the truths presented by Luther. “I\r\nam firmly resolved to imitate the example of my ancestors,”(227) wrote the\r\nmonarch. He had decided that he would not step out of the path of custom,\r\neven to walk in the ways of truth and righteousness. Because his fathers\r\ndid, he would uphold the papacy, with all its cruelty and corruption. Thus\r\nhe took his position, refusing to accept any light in advance of what his\r\nfathers had received, or to perform any duty that they had not performed.\r\n\r\nThere are many at the present day thus clinging to the customs and\r\ntraditions of their fathers. When the Lord sends them additional light,\r\nthey refuse to accept it, because, not having been granted to their\r\nfathers, it was not received by them. We are not placed where our fathers\r\nwere; consequently our duties and responsibilities are not the same as\r\ntheirs. We shall not be approved of God in looking to the example of our\r\nfathers to determine our duty instead of searching the Word of truth for\r\nourselves. Our responsibility is greater than was that of our ancestors.\r\nWe are accountable for the light which they received, and which was handed\r\ndown as an inheritance for us, and we are accountable also for the\r\nadditional light which is now shining upon us from the word of God.\r\n\r\nSaid Christ of the unbelieving Jews, “If I had not come and spoken unto\r\nthem, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their\r\nsin.”(228) The same divine power had spoken through Luther to the emperor\r\nand princes of Germany. And as the light shone forth from God’s word, his\r\nSpirit pleaded for the last time with many in that assembly. As Pilate,\r\ncenturies before, permitted pride and popularity to close his heart\r\nagainst the world’s Redeemer; as the trembling Felix bade the messenger of\r\ntruth, “Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will\r\ncall for thee;” as the proud Agrippa confessed, “Almost thou persuadest me\r\nto be a Christian,”(229) yet turned away from the Heaven-sent message,—so\r\nhad Charles V., yielding to the dictates of worldly pride and policy,\r\ndecided to reject the light of truth.\r\n\r\nRumors of the designs against Luther were widely circulated, causing great\r\nexcitement throughout the city. The Reformer had made many friends, who,\r\nknowing the treacherous cruelty of Rome toward all who dared expose her\r\ncorruptions, resolved that he should not be sacrificed. Hundreds of nobles\r\npledged themselves to protect him. Not a few openly denounced the royal\r\nmessage as evincing a weak submission to the controlling power of Rome. On\r\nthe gates of houses and in public places, placards were posted, some\r\ncondemning and others sustaining Luther. On one of these were written\r\nmerely the significant words of the wise man, “Woe to thee, O land, when\r\nthy king is a child.”(230) The popular enthusiasm in Luther’s favor\r\nthroughout all Germany convinced both the emperor and the Diet that any\r\ninjustice shown him would endanger the peace of the empire, and even the\r\nstability of the throne.\r\n\r\nFrederick of Saxony maintained a studied reserve, carefully concealing his\r\nreal feelings toward the Reformer, while at the same time he guarded him\r\nwith tireless vigilance, watching all his movements and all those of his\r\nenemies. But there were many who made no attempt to conceal their sympathy\r\nwith Luther. He was visited by princes, counts, barons, and other persons\r\nof distinction, both lay and ecclesiastical. “The doctor’s little room,”\r\nwrote Spalatin, “could not contain all the visitors who presented\r\nthemselves.”(231) The people gazed upon him as if he were more than human.\r\nEven those who had no faith in his doctrines, could not but admire that\r\nlofty integrity which led him to brave death rather than violate his\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nEarnest efforts were made to obtain Luther’s consent to a compromise with\r\nRome. Nobles and princes represented to him that if he persisted in\r\nsetting up his own judgment against that of the church and the councils,\r\nhe would soon be banished from the empire, and then would have no defense.\r\nTo this appeal Luther answered: “The gospel of Christ cannot be preached\r\nwithout offense.... Why then should the fear or apprehension of danger\r\nseparate me from the Lord, and from that divine word which alone is truth?\r\nNo; I would rather give up my body, my blood, and my life.”(232)\r\n\r\nAgain he was urged to submit to the judgment of the emperor, and then he\r\nwould have nothing to fear. “I consent,” said he in reply, “with all my\r\nheart, that the emperor, the princes, and even the meanest Christian,\r\nshould examine and judge my works; but on one condition, that they take\r\nthe word of God for their standard. Men have nothing to do but to obey it.\r\nDo not offer violence to my conscience, which is bound and chained up with\r\nthe Holy Scriptures.”(233)\r\n\r\nTo another appeal he said, “I consent to renounce my safe-conduct. I place\r\nmy person and my life in the emperor’s hands, but the word of\r\nGod—never!”(234) He stated his willingness to submit to the decision of a\r\ngeneral council, but only on condition that the council be required to\r\ndecide according to the Scriptures. “In what concerns the word of God and\r\nthe faith,” he added, “every Christian is as good a judge as the pope,\r\nthough supported by a million councils, can be for him.”(235) Both friends\r\nand foes were at last convinced that further effort for reconciliation\r\nwould be useless.\r\n\r\nHad the Reformer yielded a single point, Satan and his hosts would have\r\ngained the victory. But his unwavering firmness was the means of\r\nemancipating the church, and beginning a new and better era. The influence\r\nof this one man, who dared to think and act for himself in religious\r\nmatters, was to affect the church and the world, not only in his own time,\r\nbut in all future generations. His firmness and fidelity would strengthen\r\nall, to the close of time, who should pass through a similar experience.\r\nThe power and majesty of God stood forth above the counsel of men, above\r\nthe mighty power of Satan.\r\n\r\nLuther was soon commanded by the authority of the emperor to return home,\r\nand he knew that this notice would be speedily followed by his\r\ncondemnation. Threatening clouds overhung his path; but as he departed\r\nfrom Worms, his heart was filled with joy and praise. “The devil himself,”\r\nsaid he, “guarded the pope’s citadel; but Christ has made a wide breach in\r\nit, and Satan was constrained to confess that the Lord is mightier than\r\nhe.”(236)\r\n\r\nAfter his departure, still desirous that his firmness should not be\r\nmistaken for rebellion, Luther wrote to the emperor. “God, who is the\r\nsearcher of hearts, is my witness,” he said, “that I am ready most\r\nearnestly to obey your majesty, in honor or in dishonor, in life or in\r\ndeath, and with no exception save the word of God, by which man lives. In\r\nall the affairs of this present life, my fidelity shall be unshaken, for\r\nhere to lose or to gain is of no consequence to salvation. But when\r\neternal interests are concerned, God wills not that man should submit unto\r\nman. For such submission in spiritual matters is a real worship, and ought\r\nto be rendered solely to the Creator.”(237)\r\n\r\nOn the journey from Worms, Luther’s reception was even more flattering\r\nthan during his progress thither. Princely ecclesiastics welcomed the\r\nexcommunicated monk, and civil rulers honored the man whom the emperor had\r\ndenounced. He was urged to preach, and notwithstanding the imperial\r\nprohibition, he again entered the pulpit. “I never pledged myself to chain\r\nup the word of God,” he said, “nor will I.”(238)\r\n\r\nHe had not been long absent from Worms, when the papists prevailed upon\r\nthe emperor to issue an edict against him. In this decree Luther was\r\ndenounced as “Satan himself under the form of a man and dressed in a\r\nmonk’s frock.”(239) It was commanded that as soon as his safe-conduct\r\nshould expire, measures be taken to stop his work. All persons were\r\nforbidden to harbor him, to give him food or drink, or by word or act, in\r\npublic or private, to aid or abet him. He was to be seized wherever he\r\nmight be, and delivered to the authorities. His adherents also were to be\r\nimprisoned, and their property confiscated. His writings were to be\r\ndestroyed, and finally, all who should dare to act contrary to this decree\r\nwere included in its condemnation. The elector of Saxony, and the princes\r\nmost friendly to Luther, had left Worms soon after his departure, and the\r\nemperor’s decree received the sanction of the Diet. Now the Romanists were\r\njubilant. They considered the fate of the Reformation sealed.\r\n\r\nGod had provided a way of escape for His servant in this hour of peril. A\r\nvigilant eye had followed Luther’s movements, and a true and noble heart\r\nhad resolved upon his rescue. It was plain that Rome would be satisfied\r\nwith nothing short of his death; only by concealment could he be preserved\r\nfrom the jaws of the lion. God gave wisdom to Frederick of Saxony to\r\ndevise a plan for the Reformer’s preservation. With the co-operation of\r\ntrue friends, the elector’s purpose was carried out, and Luther was\r\neffectually hidden from friends and foes. Upon his homeward journey, he\r\nwas seized, separated from his attendants, and hurriedly conveyed through\r\nthe forest to the castle of Wartburg, an isolated mountain fortress. Both\r\nhis seizure and his concealment were so involved in mystery that even\r\nFrederick himself for a long time knew not whither he had been conducted.\r\nThis ignorance was not without design; so long as the elector knew nothing\r\nof Luther’s whereabouts, he could reveal nothing. He satisfied himself\r\nthat the Reformer was safe, and with this knowledge he was content.\r\n\r\nSpring, summer, and autumn passed, and winter came, and Luther still\r\nremained a prisoner. Aleander and his partisans exulted as the light of\r\nthe gospel seemed about to be extinguished. But instead of this, the\r\nReformer was filling his lamp from the storehouse of truth; and its light\r\nwas to shine forth with brighter radiance.\r\n\r\nIn the friendly security of the Wartburg, Luther for a time rejoiced in\r\nhis release from the heat and turmoil of battle. But he could not long\r\nfind satisfaction in quiet and repose. Accustomed to a life of activity\r\nand stern conflict, he could ill endure to remain inactive. In those\r\nsolitary days, the condition of the church rose up before him, and he\r\ncried in despair, “Alas! there is no one in this latter day of His anger,\r\nto stand like a wall before the Lord, and save Israel!”(240) Again, his\r\nthoughts returned to himself, and he feared being charged with cowardice\r\nin withdrawing from the contest. Then he reproached himself for his\r\nindolence and self-indulgence. Yet at the same time he was daily\r\naccomplishing more than it seemed possible for one man to do. His pen was\r\nnever idle. While his enemies flattered themselves that he was silenced,\r\nthey were astonished and confused by tangible proof that he was still\r\nactive. A host of tracts, issuing from his pen, circulated throughout\r\nGermany. He also performed a most important service for his countrymen by\r\ntranslating the New Testament into the German tongue. From his rocky\r\nPatmos he continued for nearly a whole year to proclaim the gospel, and\r\nrebuke the sins and errors of the times.\r\n\r\nBut it was not merely to preserve Luther from the wrath of his enemies,\r\nnor even to afford him a season of quiet for these important labors, that\r\nGod had withdrawn His servant from the stage of public life. There were\r\nresults more precious than these to be secured. In the solitude and\r\nobscurity of his mountain retreat, Luther was removed from earthly\r\nsupports, and shut out from human praise. He was thus saved from the pride\r\nand self-confidence that are so often caused by success. By suffering and\r\nhumiliation he was prepared again to walk safely upon the dizzy heights to\r\nwhich he had been so suddenly exalted.\r\n\r\nAs men rejoice in the freedom which the truth brings them, they are\r\ninclined to extol those whom God has employed to break the chains of error\r\nand superstition. Satan seeks to divert men’s thoughts and affections from\r\nGod, and to fix them upon human agencies; he leads them to honor the mere\r\ninstrument, and to ignore the Hand that directs all the events of\r\nprovidence. Too often, religious leaders who are thus praised and\r\nreverenced lose sight of their dependence upon God, and are led to trust\r\nin themselves. As a result, they seek to control the minds and consciences\r\nof the people, who are disposed to look to them for guidance instead of\r\nlooking to the word of God. The work of reform is often retarded because\r\nof this spirit indulged by its supporters. From this danger, God would\r\nguard the cause of the Reformation. He desired that work to receive, not\r\nthe impress of man, but that of God. The eyes of men had been turned to\r\nLuther as the expounder of the truth; he was removed that all eyes might\r\nbe directed to the eternal Author of truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. THE SWISS REFORMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nIn the choice of instrumentalities for the reforming of the church, the\r\nsame divine plan is seen as in that for the planting of the church. The\r\nheavenly Teacher passed by the great men of earth, the titled and wealthy,\r\nwho were accustomed to receive praise and homage as leaders of the people.\r\nThey were so proud and self-confident in their boasted superiority that\r\nthey could not be moulded to sympathize with their fellow-men, and to\r\nbecome co-laborers with the humble Man of Nazareth. To the unlearned,\r\ntoiling fishermen of Galilee was the call addressed, “Follow Me, and I\r\nwill make you fishers of men.”(241) These disciples were humble and\r\nteachable. The less they had been influenced by the false teaching of\r\ntheir time, the more successfully could Christ instruct and train them for\r\nHis service. So in the days of the Great Reformation. The leading\r\nReformers were men from humble life,—men who were most free of any of\r\ntheir time from pride of rank, and from the influence of bigotry and\r\npriestcraft. It is God’s plan to employ humble instruments to accomplish\r\ngreat results. Then the glory will not be given to men, but to Him who\r\nworks through them to will and to do of His own good pleasure.\r\n\r\nA few weeks after the birth of Luther in a miner’s cabin in Saxony, Ulric\r\nZwingle was born in a herdsman’s cottage among the Alps. Zwingle’s\r\nsurroundings in childhood, and his early training, were such as to prepare\r\nhim for his future mission. Reared amid scenes of natural grandeur,\r\nbeauty, and awful sublimity, his mind was early impressed with a sense of\r\nthe greatness, the power, and the majesty of God. The history of the brave\r\ndeeds achieved upon his native mountains, kindled his youthful\r\naspirations. And at the side of his pious grandmother he listened to the\r\nfew precious Bible stories which she had gleaned from amid the legends and\r\ntraditions of the church. With eager interest he heard of the grand deeds\r\nof patriarchs and prophets, of the shepherds who watched their flocks on\r\nthe hills of Palestine where angels talked with them, of the Babe of\r\nBethlehem and the Man of Calvary.\r\n\r\nLike John Luther, Zwingle’s father desired an education for his son, and\r\nthe boy was early sent from his native valley. His mind rapidly developed,\r\nand it soon became a question where to find teachers competent to instruct\r\nhim. At the age of thirteen he went to Bern, which then possessed the most\r\ndistinguished school in Switzerland. Here, however, a danger arose which\r\nthreatened to blight the promise of his life. Determined efforts were put\r\nforth by the friars to allure him into a monastery. The Dominican and\r\nFranciscan monks were in rivalry for popular favor. This they endeavored\r\nto secure by the showy adornments of their churches, the pomp of their\r\nceremonials, and the attractions of famous relics and miracle-working\r\nimages.\r\n\r\nThe Dominicans of Bern saw that if they could win this talented young\r\nscholar, they would secure both gain and honor. His extreme youth, his\r\nnatural ability as a speaker and writer, and his genius for music and\r\npoetry, would be more effective than all their pomp and display, in\r\nattracting the people to their services and increasing the revenues of\r\ntheir order. By deceit and flattery they endeavored to induce Zwingle to\r\nenter their convent. Luther, while a student at school, had buried himself\r\nin a convent cell, and he would have been lost to the world had not God’s\r\nprovidence released him. Zwingle was not permitted to encounter the same\r\nperil. Providentially his father received information of the designs of\r\nthe friars. He had no intention of allowing his son to follow the idle and\r\nworthless life of the monks. He saw that his future usefulness was at\r\nstake, and directed him to return home without delay.\r\n\r\nThe command was obeyed; but the youth could not be long content in his\r\nnative valley, and he soon resumed his studies, repairing, after a time,\r\nto Basel. It was here that Zwingle first heard the gospel of God’s free\r\ngrace. Wittembach, a teacher of the ancient languages, had, while studying\r\nGreek and Hebrew, been led to the Holy Scriptures, and thus rays of divine\r\nlight were shed into the minds of the students under his instruction. He\r\ndeclared that there was a truth more ancient, and of infinitely greater\r\nworth, than the theories taught by schoolmen and philosophers. This\r\nancient truth was that the death of Christ is the sinner’s only ransom. To\r\nZwingle these words were as the first ray of light that precedes the dawn.\r\n\r\nZwingle was soon called from Basel, to enter upon his life-work. His first\r\nfield of labor was in an Alpine parish, not far distant from his native\r\nvalley. Having received ordination as a priest, he “devoted himself with\r\nhis whole soul to the search after divine truth; for he was well aware,”\r\nsays a fellow-reformer, “how much he must know to whom the flock of Christ\r\nis entrusted.”(242) The more he searched the Scriptures, the clearer\r\nappeared the contrast between their truths and the heresies of Rome. He\r\nsubmitted himself to the Bible as the word of God, the only sufficient,\r\ninfallible rule. He saw that it must be its own interpreter. He dared not\r\nattempt to explain Scripture to sustain a preconceived theory or doctrine,\r\nbut held it his duty to learn what is its direct and obvious teaching. He\r\nsought to avail himself of every help to obtain a full and correct\r\nunderstanding of its meaning, and he invoked the aid of the Holy Spirit,\r\nwhich would, he declared, reveal it to all who sought it in sincerity and\r\nwith prayer.\r\n\r\n“The Scriptures,” said Zwingle, “come from God, not from man, and even\r\nthat God who enlightens will give thee to understand that the speech comes\r\nfrom God. The word of God ... cannot fail; it is bright, it teaches\r\nitself, it discloses itself, it illumines the soul with all salvation and\r\ngrace, comforts it in God, humbles it, so that it loses and even forfeits\r\nitself, and embraces God.”(243) The truth of these words Zwingle himself\r\nhad proved. Speaking of his experience at this time, he afterward wrote:\r\n“When ... I began to give myself wholly up to the Holy Scriptures,\r\nphilosophy and theology (scholastic) would always keep suggesting quarrels\r\nto me. At last I came to this, that I thought, ‘Thou must let all that\r\nlie, and learn the meaning of God purely out of His own simple word.’ Then\r\nI began to ask God for His light, and the Scriptures began to be much\r\neasier to me.”(244)\r\n\r\nThe doctrine preached by Zwingle was not received from Luther. It was the\r\ndoctrine of Christ. “If Luther preaches Christ,” said the Swiss Reformer,\r\n“he does what I am doing. Those whom he has brought to Christ are more\r\nnumerous than those whom I have led. But this matters not. I will bear no\r\nother name than that of Christ, whose soldier I am, and who alone is my\r\nchief. Never has one single word been written by me to Luther, nor by\r\nLuther to me. And why?... That it might be shown how much the Spirit of\r\nGod is in unison with itself, since both of us, without any collusion,\r\nteach the doctrine of Christ with such uniformity.”(245)\r\n\r\nIn 1516 Zwingle was invited to become a preacher in the convent at\r\nEinsiedeln. Here he was to have a closer view of the corruptions of Rome,\r\nand was to exert an influence as a Reformer that would be felt far beyond\r\nhis native Alps. Among the chief attractions of Einsiedeln was an image of\r\nthe Virgin which was said to have the power of working miracles. Above the\r\ngateway of the convent was the inscription, “Here a plenary remission of\r\nsins may be obtained.”(246) Pilgrims at all seasons resorted to the shrine\r\nof the Virgin, but at the great yearly festival of its consecration,\r\nmultitudes came from all parts of Switzerland, and even from France and\r\nGermany. Zwingle, greatly afflicted at the sight, seized the opportunity\r\nto proclaim liberty through the gospel to these bond-slaves of\r\nsuperstition.\r\n\r\n“Do not imagine,” he said, “that God is in this temple more than in any\r\nother part of creation. Whatever be the country in which you dwell, God is\r\naround you, and hears you.... Can unprofitable works, long pilgrimages,\r\nofferings, images, the invocation of the Virgin or of the saints, secure\r\nfor you the grace of God?... What avails the multitude of words with which\r\nwe embody our prayers? What efficacy has a glossy cowl, a smooth-shorn\r\nhead, a long and flowing robe, or gold-embroidered slippers?... God looks\r\nat the heart, and our hearts are far from Him.” “Christ,” he said, “who\r\nwas once offered upon the cross, is the sacrifice and victim, that had\r\nmade satisfaction for the sins of believers to all eternity.”(247)\r\n\r\nTo many listeners these teachings were unwelcome. It was a bitter\r\ndisappointment to them to be told that their toilsome journey had been\r\nmade in vain. The pardon freely offered to them through Christ they could\r\nnot comprehend. They were satisfied with the old way to heaven which Rome\r\nhad marked out for them. They shrank from the perplexity of searching for\r\nanything better. It was easier to trust their salvation to the priests and\r\nthe pope than to seek for purity of heart.\r\n\r\nBut another class received with gladness the tidings of redemption through\r\nChrist. The observances enjoined by Rome had failed to bring peace of\r\nsoul, and in faith they accepted the Saviour’s blood as their\r\npropitiation. These returned to their homes to reveal to others the\r\nprecious light which they had received. The truth was thus carried from\r\nhamlet to hamlet, from town to town, and the number of pilgrims to the\r\nVirgin’s shrine greatly lessened. There was a falling off in the\r\nofferings, and consequently in the salary of Zwingle, which was drawn from\r\nthem. But this caused him only joy as he saw that the power of fanaticism\r\nand superstition was being broken.\r\n\r\nThe authorities of the church were not blind to the work which Zwingle was\r\naccomplishing; but for the present they forbore to interfere. Hoping yet\r\nto secure him to their cause, they endeavored to win him by flatteries;\r\nand meanwhile the truth was gaining a hold upon the hearts of the people.\r\n\r\nZwingle’s labors at Einsiedeln had prepared him for a wider field, and\r\nthis he was soon to enter. After three years here, he was called to the\r\noffice of preacher in the cathedral at Zurich. This was then the most\r\nimportant town of the Swiss confederacy, and the influence exerted here\r\nwould be widely felt. The ecclesiastics by whose invitation he came to\r\nZurich were, however, desirous of preventing any innovations, and they\r\naccordingly proceeded to instruct him as to his duties.\r\n\r\n“You will make every exertion,” they said, “to collect the revenues of the\r\nchapter, without overlooking the least. You will exhort the faithful, both\r\nfrom the pulpit and in the confessional, to pay all tithes and dues, and\r\nto show by their offerings their affection to the church. You will be\r\ndiligent in increasing the income arising from the sick, from masses, and\r\nin general from every ecclesiastical ordinance.” “As for the\r\nadministration of the sacraments, the preaching, and the care of the\r\nflock,” added his instructors, “these are also the duties of the chaplain.\r\nBut for these you may employ a substitute, and particularly in preaching.\r\nYou should administer the sacraments to none but persons of note, and only\r\nwhen called upon; you are forbidden to do so without distinction of\r\npersons.”(248)\r\n\r\nZwingle listened in silence to this charge, and in reply, after expressing\r\nhis gratitude for the honor of a call to this important station, he\r\nproceeded to explain the course which he proposed, to adopt. “The life of\r\nChrist,” he said, “has been too long hidden from the people. I shall\r\npreach upon the whole of the Gospel of St. Matthew, ... drawing solely\r\nfrom the fountains of Scripture, sounding its depths, comparing one\r\npassage with another, and seeking for understanding by constant and\r\nearnest prayer. It is to God’s glory, to the praise of His only Son, to\r\nthe real salvation of souls, and to their edification in the true faith,\r\nthat I shall consecrate my ministry.”(249) Though some of the\r\necclesiastics disapproved his plan, and endeavored to dissuade him from\r\nit, Zwingle remained steadfast. He declared that he was about to introduce\r\nno new method, but the old method employed by the church in earlier and\r\npurer times.\r\n\r\nAlready an interest had been awakened in the truths he taught; and the\r\npeople flocked in great numbers to listen to his preaching. Many who had\r\nlong since ceased to attend service were among his hearers. He began his\r\nministry by opening the Gospels, and reading and explaining to his hearers\r\nthe inspired narrative of the life, teachings, and death of Christ. Here,\r\nas at Einsiedeln, he presented the word of God as the only infallible\r\nauthority, and the death of Christ as the only complete sacrifice. “It is\r\nto Christ,” he said, “that I desire to lead you,—to Christ, the true\r\nsource of salvation.”(250) Around the preacher crowded the people of all\r\nclasses, from statesmen and scholars to the artisan and the peasant. With\r\ndeep interest they listened to his words. He not only proclaimed the offer\r\nof a free salvation, but fearlessly rebuked the evils and corruptions of\r\nthe times. Many returned from the cathedral praising God. “This man,” they\r\nsaid, “is a preacher of the truth. He will be our Moses, to lead us forth\r\nfrom this Egyptian darkness.”(251)\r\n\r\nBut though at first his labors were received with great enthusiasm, after\r\na time opposition arose. The monks set themselves to hinder his work and\r\ncondemn his teachings. Many assailed him with gibes and sneers; others\r\nresorted to insolence and threats. But Zwingle bore all with patience,\r\nsaying, “If we desire to gain over the wicked to Jesus Christ, we must\r\nshut our eyes against many things.”(252)\r\n\r\nAbout this time a new agency came in to advance the work of reform. One\r\nLucian was sent to Zurich with some of Luther’s writings, by a friend of\r\nthe reformed faith at Basel, who suggested that the sale of these books\r\nmight be a powerful means of scattering the light. “Ascertain,” he wrote\r\nto Zwingle, “whether this man possesses sufficient prudence and skill; if\r\nso, let him carry from city to city, from town to town, from village to\r\nvillage, and even from house to house, among the Swiss, the works of\r\nLuther, and especially his exposition of the Lord’s prayer written for the\r\nlaity. The more they are known, the more purchasers they will find.”(253)\r\nThus the light found entrance.\r\n\r\nAt the time when God is preparing to break the shackles of ignorance and\r\nsuperstition, then it is that Satan works with greatest power to enshroud\r\nmen in darkness, and to bind their fetters still more firmly. As men were\r\nrising up in different lands to present to the people forgiveness and\r\njustification through the blood of Christ, Rome proceeded with renewed\r\nenergy to open her market throughout Christendom, offering pardon for\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nEvery sin had its price, and men were granted free license for crime, if\r\nthe treasury of the church was kept well filled. Thus the two movements\r\nadvanced,—one offering forgiveness of sin for money, the other forgiveness\r\nthrough Christ,—Rome licensing sin, and making it her source of revenue;\r\nthe Reformers condemning sin, and pointing to Christ as the propitiation\r\nand deliverer.\r\n\r\nIn Germany the sale of indulgences had been committed to the Dominican\r\nfriars, and was conducted by the infamous Tetzel. In Switzerland the\r\ntraffic was put into the hands of the Franciscans, under the control of\r\nSamson, an Italian monk. Samson had already done good service to the\r\nchurch, having secured immense sums from Germany and Switzerland to fill\r\nthe papal treasury. Now he traversed Switzerland, attracting great crowds,\r\ndespoiling the poor peasants of their scanty earnings, and exacting rich\r\ngifts from the wealthy classes. But the influence of the reform already\r\nmade itself felt in curtailing, though it could not stop, the traffic.\r\nZwingle was still at Einsiedeln when Samson, soon after entering\r\nSwitzerland, arrived with his wares at a neighboring town. Being apprised\r\nof his mission, the Reformer immediately set out to oppose him. The two\r\ndid not meet, but such was Zwingle’s success in exposing the friar’s\r\npretensions that he was obliged to leave for other quarters.\r\n\r\nAt Zurich, Zwingle preached zealously against the pardon-mongers; and when\r\nSamson approached the place, he was met by a messenger from the council,\r\nwith an intimation that he was expected to pass on. He finally secured an\r\nentrance by stratagem, but was sent away without the sale of a single\r\npardon, and he soon after left Switzerland.\r\n\r\nA strong impetus was given to the reform by the appearance of the plague,\r\nor “great death,” which swept over Switzerland in the year 1519. As men\r\nwere thus brought face to face with the destroyer, many were led to feel\r\nhow vain and worthless were the pardons which they had so lately\r\npurchased; and they longed for a surer foundation for their faith. Zwingle\r\nat Zurich was smitten down; he was brought so low that all hope of his\r\nrecovery was relinquished, and the report was widely circulated that he\r\nwas dead. In that trying hour his hope and courage were unshaken. He\r\nlooked in faith to the cross of Calvary, trusting in the all-sufficient\r\npropitiation for sin. When he came back from the gates of death, it was to\r\npreach the gospel with greater fervor than ever before; and his words\r\nexerted an unwonted power. The people welcomed with joy their beloved\r\npastor, returned to them from the brink of the grave. They themselves had\r\ncome from attending upon the sick and the dying, and they felt, as never\r\nbefore, the value of the gospel.\r\n\r\nZwingle had arrived at a clearer understanding of its truths, and had more\r\nfully experienced in himself its renewing power. The fall of man and the\r\nplan of redemption were the subjects upon which he dwelt. “In Adam,” he\r\nsaid, “we are all dead, sunk in corruption and condemnation.”(254) “Christ\r\n... has purchased for us a never-ending redemption ... His passion is ...\r\nan eternal sacrifice, and everlastingly effectual to heal; it satisfies\r\nthe divine justice forever in behalf of all those who rely upon it with\r\nfirm and unshaken faith.” Yet he clearly taught that men are not, because\r\nof the grace of Christ, free to continue in sin. “Wherever there is faith\r\nin God, there God is; and wherever God abideth, there a zeal exists urging\r\nand impelling men to good works.”(255)\r\n\r\nSuch was the interest in Zwingle’s preaching that the cathedral was filled\r\nto overflowing with the crowds that came to listen to him. Little by\r\nlittle, as they could bear it, he opened the truth to his hearers. He was\r\ncareful not to introduce, at first, points which would startle them and\r\ncreate prejudice. His work was to win their hearts to the teachings of\r\nChrist, to soften them by His love, and keep before them His example; and\r\nas they should receive the principles of the gospel, their superstitious\r\nbeliefs and practices would inevitably be overthrown.\r\n\r\nStep by step the Reformation advanced in Zurich. In alarm its enemies\r\naroused to active opposition. One year before, the monk of Wittenberg had\r\nuttered his “No” to the pope and the emperor at Worms, and now everything\r\nseemed to indicate a similar withstanding of the papal claims at Zurich.\r\nRepeated attacks were made upon Zwingle. In the papal cantons, from time\r\nto time, disciples of the gospel were brought to the stake, but this was\r\nnot enough; the teacher of heresy must be silenced. Accordingly the bishop\r\nof Constance dispatched three deputies to the Council of Zurich, accusing\r\nZwingle of teaching the people to transgress the laws of the church, thus\r\nendangering the peace and good order of society. If the authority of the\r\nchurch were to be set aside, he urged, universal anarchy would result.\r\nZwingle replied that he had been for four years teaching the gospel in\r\nZurich, “which was more quiet and peaceful than any other town in the\r\nconfederacy.” “Is not, then,” he said, “Christianity the best safeguard of\r\nthe general security?”(256)\r\n\r\nThe deputies had admonished the councilors to continue in the church, out\r\nof which, they declared, there was no salvation. Zwingle responded: “Let\r\nnot this accusation move you. The foundation of the church is the same\r\nRock, the same Christ, that gave Peter his name because he confessed Him\r\nfaithfully. In every nation whosoever believes with all his heart in the\r\nLord Jesus is accepted of God. Here, truly, is the church, out of which no\r\none can be saved.”(257) As a result of the conference, one of the bishop’s\r\ndeputies accepted the reformed faith.\r\n\r\nThe council declined to take action against Zwingle, and Rome prepared for\r\na fresh attack. The Reformer, when apprised of the plots of his enemies,\r\nexclaimed, “Let them come on; I fear them as the beetling cliff fears the\r\nwaves that thunder at its feet.”(258) The efforts of the ecclesiastics\r\nonly furthered the cause which they sought to overthrow. The truth\r\ncontinued to spread. In Germany its adherents, cast down by Luther’s\r\ndisappearance, took heart again, as they saw the progress of the gospel in\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\nAs the Reformation became established in Zurich, its fruits were more\r\nfully seen in the suppression of vice, and the promotion of order and\r\nharmony. “Peace has her habitation in our town,” wrote Zwingle; “no\r\nquarrel, no hypocrisy, no envy, no strife. Whence can such union come but\r\nfrom the Lord, and our doctrine, which fills us with the fruits of peace\r\nand piety?”(259)\r\n\r\nThe victories gained by the Reformation stirred the Romanists to still\r\nmore determined efforts for its overthrow. Seeing how little had been\r\naccomplished by persecution in suppressing Luther’s work in Germany, they\r\ndecided to meet the reform with its own weapons. They would hold a\r\ndisputation with Zwingle, and having the arrangement of matters, they\r\nwould make sure of victory by choosing, themselves, not only the place of\r\nthe combat, but the judges that should decide between the disputants. And\r\nif they could once get Zwingle into their power, they would take care that\r\nhe did not escape them. The leader silenced, the movement could speedily\r\nbe crushed. This purpose, however, was carefully concealed.\r\n\r\nThe disputation was appointed to be held at Baden; but Zwingle was not\r\npresent. The Council of Zurich, suspecting the designs of the papists, and\r\nwarned by the burning piles kindled in the papal cantons for confessors of\r\nthe gospel, forbade their pastor to expose himself to this peril. At\r\nZurich he was ready to meet all the partisans that Rome might send; but to\r\ngo to Baden, where the blood of martyrs for the truth had just been shed,\r\nwas to go to certain death. Œcolampadius and Haller were chosen to\r\nrepresent the Reformers, while the famous Doctor Eck, supported by a host\r\nof learned doctors and prelates, was the champion of Rome.\r\n\r\nThough Zwingle was not present at the conference, his influence was felt.\r\nThe secretaries were all chosen by the papists, and others were forbidden\r\nto take notes, on pain of death. Notwithstanding this, Zwingle received\r\ndaily a faithful account of what was said at Baden. A student in\r\nattendance at the disputation, made a record each evening of the arguments\r\nthat day presented. These papers two other students undertook to deliver,\r\nwith the daily letters of Œcolampadius, to Zwingle at Zurich. The Reformer\r\nanswered, giving counsel and suggestions. His letters were written by\r\nnight, and the students returned with them to Baden in the morning. To\r\nelude the vigilance of the guard stationed at the city gates, these\r\nmessengers brought baskets of poultry on their heads, and they were\r\npermitted to pass without hindrance.\r\n\r\nThus Zwingle maintained the battle with his wily antagonists. He “has\r\nlabored more,” said Myconius, “by his meditations, his sleepless nights,\r\nand the advice which he transmitted to Baden, than he would have done by\r\ndiscussing in person in the midst of his enemies.”(260)\r\n\r\nThe Romanists, flushed with anticipated triumph, had come to Baden attired\r\nin their richest robes and glittering with jewels. They fared luxuriously,\r\ntheir tables spread with the most costly delicacies and the choicest\r\nwines. The burden of their ecclesiastical duties was lightened by gaiety\r\nand reveling. In marked contrast appeared the Reformers, who were looked\r\nupon by the people as little better than a company of beggars, and whose\r\nfrugal fare kept them but short time at table. Œcolampadius’s landlord,\r\ntaking occasion to watch him in his room, found him always engaged in\r\nstudy or at prayer, and greatly wondering, reported that the heretic was\r\nat least “very pious.”\r\n\r\nAt the conference, “Eck haughtily ascended a pulpit splendidly decorated,\r\nwhile the humble Œcolampadius, meanly clothed, was forced to take his seat\r\nin front of his opponent on a rudely carved stool.”(261) Eck’s stentorian\r\nvoice and unbounded assurance never failed him. His zeal was stimulated by\r\nthe hope of gold as well as fame; for the defender of the faith was to be\r\nrewarded by a handsome fee. When better arguments failed, he had resort to\r\ninsults, and even to oaths.\r\n\r\nŒcolampadius, modest and self-distrustful, had shrunk from the combat, and\r\nhe entered upon it with the solemn avowal, “I acknowledge no other\r\nstandard of judgment than the word of God.”(262) Though gentle and\r\ncourteous in demeanor, he proved himself able and unflinching. While the\r\nRomanists, according to their wont, appealed for authority to the customs\r\nof the church, the Reformer adhered steadfastly to the Holy Scriptures.\r\n“Custom,” he said, “has no force in our Switzerland, unless it be\r\naccording to the constitution; now, in matters of faith, the Bible is our\r\nconstitution.”(263)\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the two disputants was not without effect. The calm,\r\nclear reasoning of the Reformer, so gently and modestly presented,\r\nappealed to minds that turned in disgust from Eck’s boastful and\r\nboisterous assumptions.\r\n\r\nThe discussion continued eighteen days. At its close, the papists with\r\ngreat confidence claimed the victory. Most of the deputies sided with\r\nRome, and the Diet pronounced the Reformers vanquished, and declared that\r\nthey, together with Zwingle, their leader, were cut off from the church.\r\nBut the fruits of the conference revealed on which side the advantage lay.\r\nThe contest resulted in a strong impetus to the Protestant cause, and it\r\nwas not long afterward that the important cities of Bern and Basel\r\ndeclared for the Reformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10. PROGRESS OF REFORM IN GERMANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nLuther’s mysterious disappearance excited consternation throughout all\r\nGermany. Inquiries concerning him were heard everywhere. The wildest\r\nrumors were circulated, and many believed that he had been murdered. There\r\nwas great lamentation, not only by his avowed friends, but by thousands\r\nwho had not openly taken their stand with the Reformation. Many bound\r\nthemselves by a solemn oath to avenge his death.\r\n\r\nThe Romish leaders saw with terror to what a pitch had risen the feeling\r\nagainst them. Though at first exultant at the supposed death of Luther,\r\nthey soon desired to hide from the wrath of the people. His enemies had\r\nnot been so troubled by his most daring acts while among them, as they\r\nwere at his removal. Those who in their rage had sought to destroy the\r\nbold Reformer, were filled with fear now that he had become a helpless\r\ncaptive. “The only remaining way of saving ourselves,” said one, “is to\r\nlight torches, and hunt for Luther through the whole world, to restore him\r\nto the nation that is calling for him.”(264) The edict of the emperor\r\nseemed to fall powerless. The papal legates were filled with indignation\r\nas they saw that it commanded far less attention than did the fate of\r\nLuther.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: Luther at the Wartburg.]\r\n\r\nLuther at the Wartburg.  “The tidings that he was safe, though a prisoner,\r\n                     calmed the fears of the people.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tidings that he was safe, though a prisoner, calmed the fears of the\r\npeople, while it still further aroused their enthusiasm in his favor. His\r\nwritings were read with greater eagerness than ever before. Increasing\r\nnumbers joined the cause of the heroic man who had, at such fearful odds,\r\ndefended the word of God. The Reformation was constantly gaining in\r\nstrength. The seed which Luther had sown sprung up everywhere. His absence\r\naccomplished a work which his presence would have failed to do. Other\r\nlaborers felt a new responsibility, now that their great leader was\r\nremoved. With new faith and earnestness they pressed forward to do all in\r\ntheir power, that the work so nobly begun might not be hindered.\r\n\r\nBut Satan was not idle. He now attempted what he has attempted in every\r\nother reformatory movement,—to deceive and destroy the people by palming\r\noff upon them a counterfeit in place of the true work. As there were false\r\nchrists in the first century of the Christian church, so there arose false\r\nprophets in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nA few men, deeply affected by the excitement in the religious world,\r\nimagined themselves to have received special revelations from Heaven, and\r\nclaimed to have been divinely commissioned to carry forward to its\r\ncompletion the Reformation which, they declared, had been but feebly begun\r\nby Luther. In truth, they were undoing the very work which he had\r\naccomplished. They rejected the great principle which was the very\r\nfoundation of the Reformation,—that the word of God is the all-sufficient\r\nrule of faith and practice; and for that unerring guide they substituted\r\nthe changeable, uncertain standard of their own feelings and impressions.\r\nBy this act of setting aside the great detector of error and falsehood,\r\nthe way was opened for Satan to control minds as best pleased himself.\r\n\r\nOne of these prophets claimed to have been instructed by the angel\r\nGabriel. A student who united with him forsook his studies, declaring that\r\nhe had been endowed by God Himself with wisdom to expound His word. Others\r\nwho were naturally inclined to fanaticism united with them. The\r\nproceedings of these enthusiasts created no little excitement. The\r\npreaching of Luther had aroused the people everywhere to feel the\r\nnecessity of reform, and now some really honest persons were misled by the\r\npretensions of the new prophets.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the movement proceeded to Wittenberg, and urged their\r\nclaims upon Melanchthon and his co-laborers. Said they: “We are sent by\r\nGod to instruct the people. We have held familiar conversations with the\r\nLord; we know what will happen; in a word, we are apostles and prophets,\r\nand appeal to Doctor Luther.”(265)\r\n\r\nThe Reformers were astonished and perplexed. This was such an element as\r\nthey had never before encountered, and they knew not what course to\r\npursue. Said Melanchthon: “There are indeed extraordinary spirits in these\r\nmen; but what spirits?... On the one hand, let us beware of quenching the\r\nSpirit of God, and on the other, of being led astray by the spirit of\r\nSatan.”(266)\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the new teaching soon became apparent. The people were led to\r\nneglect the Bible, or to cast it wholly aside. The schools were thrown\r\ninto confusion. Students, spurning all restraint, abandoned their studies,\r\nand withdrew from the university. The men who thought themselves competent\r\nto revive and control the work of the Reformation, succeeded only in\r\nbringing it to the verge of ruin. The Romanists now regained their\r\nconfidence, and exclaimed exultingly, “One last struggle, and all will be\r\nours.”(267)\r\n\r\nLuther at the Wartburg, hearing of what had occurred, said with deep\r\nconcern, “I always expected that Satan would send us this plague.”(268) He\r\nperceived the true character of those pretended prophets, and saw the\r\ndanger that threatened the cause of truth. The opposition of the pope and\r\nthe emperor had not caused him so great perplexity and distress as he now\r\nexperienced. From the professed friends of the Reformation had risen its\r\nworst enemies. The very truths which had brought him so great joy and\r\nconsolation were being employed to stir up strife and create confusion in\r\nthe church.\r\n\r\nIn the work of reform, Luther had been urged forward by the Spirit of God,\r\nand had been carried beyond himself. He had not purposed to take such\r\npositions as he did, or to make so radical changes. He had been but the\r\ninstrument in the hand of Infinite Power. Yet he often trembled for the\r\nresult of his work. He had once said, “If I knew that my doctrine injured\r\none man, one single man, however lowly and obscure,—which it cannot, for\r\nit is the gospel itself,—I would rather die ten times than not retract\r\nit.”(269)\r\n\r\nAnd now Wittenberg itself, the very center of the Reformation, was fast\r\nfalling under the power of fanaticism and lawlessness. This terrible\r\ncondition had not resulted from the teachings of Luther; but throughout\r\nGermany his enemies were charging it upon him. In bitterness of soul he\r\nsometimes asked, “Can such then be the end of this great work of the\r\nReformation?”(270) Again, as he wrestled with God in prayer, peace flowed\r\ninto his heart. “The work is not mine, but Thine own,” he said; “Thou wilt\r\nnot suffer it to be corrupted by superstition or fanaticism.” But the\r\nthought of remaining longer from the conflict in such a crisis, became\r\ninsupportable. He determined to return to Wittenberg.\r\n\r\nWithout delay he set out on his perilous journey. He was under the ban of\r\nthe empire. Enemies were at liberty to take his life; friends were\r\nforbidden to aid or shelter him. The imperial government was adopting the\r\nmost stringent measures against his adherents. But he saw that the work of\r\nthe gospel was imperiled, and in the name of the Lord he went out\r\nfearlessly to battle for the truth.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the elector, after stating his purpose to leave the\r\nWartburg, Luther said: “Be it known to your highness that I am going to\r\nWittenberg under a protection far higher than that of princes and\r\nelectors. I think not of soliciting your highness’ support, and far from\r\ndesiring your protection, I would rather protect you myself. If I knew\r\nthat your highness could or would protect me, I would not go to Wittenberg\r\nat all. There is no sword that can further this cause. God alone must do\r\neverything, without the help or concurrence of man. He who has the\r\ngreatest faith is he who is most able to protect.”(271)\r\n\r\nIn a second letter, written on the way to Wittenberg, Luther added: “I am\r\nready to incur the displeasure of your highness and the anger of the whole\r\nworld. Are not the Wittenbergers my sheep? Has not God entrusted them to\r\nme? And ought I not, if necessary, to expose myself to death for their\r\nsakes? Besides, I fear to see a terrible outbreak in Germany, by which God\r\nwill punish our nation.”(272)\r\n\r\nWith great caution and humility, yet with decision and firmness, he\r\nentered upon his work. “By the Word,” said he, “must we overthrow and\r\ndestroy what has been set up by violence. I will not make use of force\r\nagainst the superstitious and unbelieving.... No one must be constrained.\r\nLiberty is the very essence of faith.”(273)\r\n\r\nIt was soon noised through Wittenberg that Luther had returned, and that\r\nhe was to preach. The people flocked from all directions, and the church\r\nwas filled to overflowing. Ascending the pulpit, he with great wisdom and\r\ngentleness instructed, exhorted, and reproved. Touching the course of some\r\nwho had resorted to violent measures in abolishing the mass, he said:\r\n\r\n“The mass is a bad thing; God is opposed to it; it ought to be abolished;\r\nand I would that throughout the whole world it were replaced by the supper\r\nof the gospel. But let no one be torn from it by force. We must leave the\r\nmatter in God’s hands. His word must act, and not we. And why so? you will\r\nask. Because I do not hold men’s hearts in my hand, as the potter holds\r\nthe clay. We have a right to speak: we have _not_ the right to act. Let us\r\npreach; the rest belongs unto God. Were I to employ force, what should I\r\ngain? Grimace, formality, apings, human ordinances, and hypocrisy.... But\r\nthere would be no sincerity of heart, nor faith, nor charity. Where these\r\nthree are wanting, all is wanting, and I would not give a pear-stalk for\r\nsuch a result.... God does more by His word alone than you and I and all\r\nthe world by our united strength. God lays hold upon the heart; and when\r\nthe heart is taken, all is won....\r\n\r\n“I will preach, discuss, and write; but I will constrain none, for faith\r\nis a voluntary act. See what I have done. I stood up against the pope,\r\nindulgences, and papists, but without violence or tumult. I put forward\r\nGod’s word; I preached and wrote—this was all I did. And yet while I was\r\nasleep, ... the word that I had preached overthrew popery, so that neither\r\nprince nor emperor has done it so much harm. And yet I did nothing; the\r\nWord alone did all. If I had wished to appeal to force, the whole of\r\nGermany would perhaps have been deluged with blood. But what would have\r\nbeen the result? Ruin and desolation both to body and soul. I therefore\r\nkept quiet, and left the Word to run through the world alone.”(274)\r\n\r\nDay after day, for a whole week, Luther continued to preach to eager\r\ncrowds. The word of God broke the spell of fanatical excitement. The power\r\nof the gospel brought back the misguided people into the way of truth.\r\n\r\nLuther had no desire to encounter the fanatics whose course had been\r\nproductive of so great evil. He knew them to be men of unsound judgment\r\nand undisciplined passions, who, while claiming to be especially\r\nilluminated from heaven, would not endure the slightest contradiction, or\r\neven the kindest reproof or counsel. Arrogating to themselves supreme\r\nauthority, they required every one, without a question, to acknowledge\r\ntheir claims. But as they demanded an interview with him, he consented to\r\nmeet them; and so successfully did he expose their pretensions, that the\r\nimpostors at once departed from Wittenberg.\r\n\r\nThe fanaticism was checked for a time; but several years later it broke\r\nout with greater violence and more terrible results. Said Luther,\r\nconcerning the leaders in this movement: “To them the Holy Scriptures were\r\nbut a dead letter, and they all began to cry, ‘The Spirit! the Spirit!’\r\nBut most assuredly I will not follow where their spirit leads them. May\r\nGod of His mercy preserve me from a church in which there are none but\r\nsaints. I desire to dwell with the humble, the feeble, the sick, who know\r\nand feel their sins, and who groan and cry continually to God from the\r\nbottom of their hearts to obtain His consolation and support.”(275)\r\n\r\nThomas Münzer, the most active of the fanatics, was a man of considerable\r\nability, which, rightly directed, would have enabled him to do good; but\r\nhe had not learned the first principles of true religion. “He was\r\npossessed with a desire of reforming the world, and forgot, as all\r\nenthusiasts do, that the reformation should begin with himself.”(276) He\r\nwas ambitious to obtain position and influence, and was unwilling to be\r\nsecond, even to Luther. He declared that the Reformers, in substituting\r\nthe authority of Scripture for that of the pope, were only establishing a\r\ndifferent form of popery. He himself, he claimed, had been divinely\r\ncommissioned to introduce the true reform. “He who possesses this spirit,”\r\nsaid Münzer, “possesses the true faith, although he should never see the\r\nScriptures in his life.”(277)\r\n\r\nThe fanatical teachers gave themselves up to be governed by impressions,\r\nregarding every thought and impulse as the voice of God; consequently they\r\nwent to great extremes. Some even burned their Bibles, exclaiming, “The\r\nletter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.” Münzer’s teaching appealed to\r\nmen’s desire for the marvelous, while it gratified their pride by\r\nvirtually placing human ideas and opinions above the word of God. His\r\ndoctrines were received by thousands. He soon denounced all order in\r\npublic worship, and declared that to obey princes was to attempt to serve\r\nboth God and Belial.\r\n\r\nThe minds of the people, already beginning to throw off the yoke of the\r\npapacy, were also becoming impatient under the restraints of civil\r\nauthority. Münzer’s revolutionary teachings, claiming divine sanction, led\r\nthem to break away from all control, and give the rein to their prejudices\r\nand passions. The most terrible scenes of sedition and strife followed,\r\nand the fields of Germany were drenched with blood.\r\n\r\nThe agony of soul which Luther had so long before experienced at Erfurt,\r\nnow pressed upon him with redoubled power as he saw the results of\r\nfanaticism charged upon the Reformation. The papist princes declared—and\r\nmany were ready to credit the statement—that the rebellion was the\r\nlegitimate fruit of Luther’s doctrines. Although this charge was without\r\nthe slightest foundation, it could not but cause the Reformer great\r\ndistress. That the cause of truth should be thus disgraced by being ranked\r\nwith the basest fanaticism, seemed more than he could endure. On the other\r\nhand, the leaders in the revolt hated Luther because he had not only\r\nopposed their doctrines and denied their claims to divine inspiration, but\r\nhad pronounced them rebels against the civil authority. In retaliation\r\nthey denounced him as a base pretender. He seemed to have brought upon\r\nhimself the enmity of both princes and people.\r\n\r\nThe Romanists exulted, expecting to witness the speedy downfall of the\r\nReformation; and they blamed Luther, even for the errors which he had been\r\nmost earnestly endeavoring to correct. The fanatical party, by falsely\r\nclaiming to have been treated with great injustice, succeeded in gaining\r\nthe sympathies of a large class of the people, and, as is often the case\r\nwith those who take the wrong side, they came to be regarded as martyrs.\r\nThus the ones who were exerting every energy in opposition to the\r\nReformation, were pitied and lauded as the victims of cruelty and\r\noppression. This was the work of Satan, prompted by the same spirit of\r\nrebellion which was first manifested in heaven.\r\n\r\nSatan is constantly seeking to deceive men, and lead them to call sin\r\nrighteousness, and righteousness sin. How successful has been his work!\r\nHow often censure and reproach are cast upon God’s faithful servants\r\nbecause they will stand fearlessly in defense of the truth! Men who are\r\nbut agents of Satan are praised and flattered, and even looked upon as\r\nmartyrs, while those who should be respected and sustained for their\r\nfidelity to God, are left to stand alone, under suspicion and distrust.\r\n\r\nCounterfeit holiness, spurious sanctification, is still doing its work of\r\ndeception. Under various forms it exhibits the same spirit as in the days\r\nof Luther, diverting minds from the Scriptures, and leading men to follow\r\ntheir own feelings and impressions rather than to yield obedience to the\r\nlaw of God. This is one of Satan’s most successful devices to cast\r\nreproach upon purity and truth.\r\n\r\nFearlessly did Luther defend the gospel from the attacks which came from\r\nevery quarter. The word of God proved itself a weapon mighty in every\r\nconflict. With that Word he warred against the usurped authority of the\r\npope, and the rationalistic philosophy of the schoolmen, while he stood\r\nfirm as a rock against the fanaticism that sought to ally itself with the\r\nReformation.\r\n\r\nEach of these opposing elements was in its own way setting aside the Holy\r\nScriptures, and exalting human wisdom as the source of religious truth and\r\nknowledge. Rationalism idolizes reason, and makes this the criterion for\r\nreligion. Romanism, claiming for her sovereign pontiff an inspiration\r\ndescended in unbroken line from the apostles, and unchangeable through all\r\ntime, gives ample opportunity for every species of extravagance and\r\ncorruption to be concealed under the sanctity of the apostolic commission.\r\nThe inspiration claimed by Münzer and his associates proceeded from no\r\nhigher source than the vagaries of the imagination, and its influence was\r\nsubversive of all authority, human or divine. True Christianity receives\r\nthe word of God as the great treasure-house of inspired truth, and the\r\ntest of all inspiration.\r\n\r\nUpon his return from the Wartburg, Luther completed his translation of the\r\nNew Testament, and the gospel was soon after given to the people of\r\nGermany in their own language. This translation was received with great\r\njoy by all who loved the truth; but it was scornfully rejected by those\r\nwho chose human traditions and the commandments of men.\r\n\r\nThe priests were alarmed at the thought that the common people would now\r\nbe able to discuss with them the precepts of God’s word, and that their\r\nown ignorance would thus be exposed. The weapons of their carnal reasoning\r\nwere powerless against the sword of the Spirit. Rome summoned all her\r\nauthority to prevent the circulation of the Scriptures; but decrees,\r\nanathemas, and tortures were alike in vain. The more she condemned and\r\nprohibited the Bible, the greater was the anxiety of the people to know\r\nwhat it really taught. All who could read were eager to study the word of\r\nGod for themselves. They carried it about with them, and read and re-read,\r\nand could not be satisfied until they had committed large portions to\r\nmemory. Seeing the favor with which the New Testament was received, Luther\r\nimmediately began the translation of the Old, and published it in parts as\r\nfast as completed.\r\n\r\nLuther’s writings were welcomed alike in city and in hamlet. “What Luther\r\nand his friends composed, others circulated. Monks, convinced of the\r\nunlawfulness of monastic obligations, desirous of exchanging a long life\r\nof slothfulness for one of active exertion, but too ignorant to proclaim\r\nthe word of God, traveled through the provinces, visiting hamlets and\r\ncottages, where they sold the books of Luther and his friends. Germany\r\nsoon swarmed with these bold colporteurs.”(278)\r\n\r\nThese writings were studied with deep interest by rich and poor, the\r\nlearned and the ignorant. At night the teachers of the village schools\r\nread them aloud to little groups gathered at the fireside. With every\r\neffort, some souls would be convicted of the truth, and, receiving the\r\nword with gladness, would in their turn tell the good news to others.\r\n\r\nThe words of inspiration were verified: “The entrance of Thy words giveth\r\nlight; it giveth understanding unto the simple.”(279) The study of the\r\nScriptures was working a mighty change in the minds and hearts of the\r\npeople. The papal rule had placed upon its subjects an iron yoke which\r\nheld them in ignorance and degradation. A superstitious observance of\r\nforms had been scrupulously maintained; but in all their service the heart\r\nand intellect had had little part. The preaching of Luther, setting forth\r\nthe plain truths of God’s word, and then the word itself, placed in the\r\nhands of the common people, had aroused their dormant powers, not only\r\npurifying and ennobling the spiritual nature, but imparting new strength\r\nand vigor to the intellect.\r\n\r\nPersons of all ranks were to be seen with the Bible in their hands,\r\ndefending the doctrines of the Reformation. The papists who had left the\r\nstudy of the Scriptures to the priests and monks, now called upon them to\r\ncome forward and refute the new teachings. But, ignorant alike of the\r\nScriptures and of the power of God, priests and friars were totally\r\ndefeated by those whom they had denounced as unlearned and heretical.\r\n“Unhappily,” said a Catholic writer, “Luther had persuaded his followers\r\nto put no faith in any other oracle than the Holy Scriptures.”(280) Crowds\r\nwould gather to hear the truth advocated by men of little education, and\r\neven discussed by them with learned and eloquent theologians. The shameful\r\nignorance of these great men was made apparent as their arguments were met\r\nby the simple teachings of God’s word. Laborers, soldiers, women, and even\r\nchildren, were better acquainted with the Bible teachings than were the\r\npriests and learned doctors.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the disciples of the gospel and the upholders of\r\npopish superstition was no less manifest in the ranks of scholars than\r\namong the common people. “Opposed to the old champions of the hierarchy,\r\nwho had neglected the study of languages and the cultivation of\r\nliterature, ... were generous-minded youths, devoted to study,\r\ninvestigating Scripture, and familiarizing themselves with the\r\nmasterpieces of antiquity. Possessing an active mind, an elevated soul,\r\nand intrepid heart, these young men soon acquired such knowledge that for\r\na long period none could compete with them.... Accordingly, when these\r\nyouthful defenders of the Reformation met the Romish doctors in any\r\nassembly, they attacked them with such ease and confidence that these\r\nignorant men hesitated, became embarrassed, and fell into a contempt\r\nmerited in the eyes of all.”(281)\r\n\r\nAs the Romish clergy saw their congregations diminishing, they invoked the\r\naid of the magistrates, and by every means in their power endeavored to\r\nbring back their hearers. But the people had found in the new teachings\r\nthat which supplied the wants of their souls, and they turned away from\r\nthose who had so long fed them with the worthless husks of superstitious\r\nrites and human traditions.\r\n\r\nWhen persecution was kindled against the teachers of the truth, they gave\r\nheed to the words of Christ, “When they persecute you in this city, flee\r\nye into another.”(282) The light penetrated everywhere. The fugitives\r\nwould find somewhere a hospitable door opened to them, and there abiding,\r\nthey would preach Christ, sometimes in the church, or if denied that\r\nprivilege, in private houses or in the open air. Wherever they could\r\nobtain a hearing was a consecrated temple. The truth, proclaimed with such\r\nenergy and assurance, spread with irresistible power.\r\n\r\nIn vain both ecclesiastical and civil authorities were invoked to crush\r\nthe heresy. In vain they resorted to imprisonment, torture, fire, and\r\nsword. Thousands of believers sealed their faith with their blood, and yet\r\nthe work went on. Persecution served only to extend the truth; and the\r\nfanaticism which Satan endeavored to unite with it, resulted in making\r\nmore clear the contrast between the work of Satan and the work of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11. PROTEST OF THE PRINCES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nOne of the noblest testimonies ever uttered for the Reformation, was the\r\nProtest offered by the Christian princes of Germany at the Diet of Spires\r\nin 1529. The courage, faith, and firmness of those men of God, gained for\r\nsucceeding ages liberty of thought and of conscience. Their Protest gave\r\nto the reformed church the name of Protestant; its principles are “the\r\nvery essence of Protestantism.”(283)\r\n\r\nA dark and threatening day had come for the Reformation. Notwithstanding\r\nthe edict of Worms, declaring Luther to be an outlaw, and forbidding the\r\nteaching or belief of his doctrines, religious toleration had thus far\r\nprevailed in the empire. God’s providence had held in check the forces\r\nthat opposed the truth. Charles V. was bent on crushing the Reformation,\r\nbut often as he raised his hand to strike, he had been forced to turn\r\naside the blow. Again and again the immediate destruction of all who dared\r\nto oppose themselves to Rome appeared inevitable; but at the critical\r\nmoment the armies of the Turk appeared on the eastern frontier, or the\r\nking of France, or even the pope himself, jealous of the increasing\r\ngreatness of the emperor, made war upon him; and thus, amid the strife and\r\ntumult of nations, the Reformation had been left to strengthen and extend.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, the papal sovereigns had stifled their feuds, that they\r\nmight make common cause against the Reformers. The Diet of Spires in 1526\r\nhad given each state full liberty in matters of religion until the meeting\r\nof a general council; but no sooner had the dangers passed which secured\r\nthis concession, than the emperor summoned a second Diet to convene at\r\nSpires in 1529 for the purpose of crushing heresy. The princes were to be\r\ninduced, by peaceable means if possible, to side against the Reformation;\r\nbut if these failed, Charles was prepared to resort to the sword.\r\n\r\nThe papists were exultant. They appeared at Spires in great numbers, and\r\nopenly manifested their hostility toward the Reformers and all who favored\r\nthem. Said Melanchthon, “We are the execration and the sweepings of the\r\nworld; but Christ will look down on His poor people, and will preserve\r\nthem.”(284) The evangelical princes in attendance at the Diet were\r\nforbidden even to have the gospel preached in their dwellings. But the\r\npeople of Spires thirsted for the word of God, and notwithstanding the\r\nprohibition, thousands flocked to the services held in the chapel of the\r\nelector of Saxony.\r\n\r\nThis hastened the crisis. An imperial message announced to the Diet that\r\nas the resolution granting liberty of conscience had given rise to great\r\ndisorders, the emperor required that it be annulled. This arbitrary act\r\nexcited the indignation and alarm of the evangelical Christians. Said one,\r\n“Christ has again fallen into the hands of Caiaphas and Pilate.” The\r\nRomanists became more violent. A bigoted papist declared: “The Turks are\r\nbetter than the Lutherans; for the Turks observe fast-days, and the\r\nLutherans violate them. If we must choose between the Holy Scriptures of\r\nGod and the old errors of the church, we should reject the former.” Said\r\nMelanchthon, “Every day, in full assembly, Faber casts some new stone at\r\nus Gospelers.”(285)\r\n\r\nReligious toleration had been legally established, and the evangelical\r\nstates were resolved to oppose the infringement of their rights. Luther,\r\nbeing still under the ban imposed by the edict of Worms, was not permitted\r\nto be present at Spires; but his place was supplied by his co-laborers and\r\nthe princes whom God had raised up to defend His cause in this emergency.\r\nThe noble Frederick of Saxony, Luther’s former protector, had been removed\r\nby death; but Duke John, his brother and successor, had joyfully welcomed\r\nthe Reformation, and while a friend of peace, he displayed great energy\r\nand courage in all matters relating to the interests of the faith.\r\n\r\nThe priests demanded that the states which had accepted the Reformation\r\nsubmit implicitly to Romish jurisdiction. The Reformers, on the other\r\nhand, claimed the liberty which had previously been granted. They could\r\nnot consent that Rome should again bring under her control those states\r\nthat had with so great joy received the word of God.\r\n\r\nAs a compromise it was finally proposed that where the Reformation had not\r\nbecome established, the edict of Worms should be rigorously enforced; and\r\nthat “in those where the people had deviated from it, and where they could\r\nnot conform to it without danger of revolt, they should at least effect no\r\nnew reform, they should touch upon no controverted point, they should not\r\noppose the celebration of the mass, they should permit no Roman Catholic\r\nto embrace Lutheranism.”(286) This measure passed the Diet, to the great\r\nsatisfaction of the popish priests and prelates.\r\n\r\nIf this edict were enforced, “the Reformation could neither be extended\r\n... where as yet it was unknown, nor be established on solid foundations\r\n... where it already existed.”(287) Liberty of speech would be prohibited.\r\nNo conversions would be allowed. And to these restrictions and\r\nprohibitions the friends of the Reformation were required at once to\r\nsubmit. The hopes of the world seemed about to be extinguished. “The\r\nre-establishment of the Romish hierarchy ... would infallibly bring back\r\nthe ancient abuses;” and an occasion would readily be found for\r\n“completing the destruction of a work already so violently shaken” by\r\nfanaticism and dissension.(288)\r\n\r\nAs the evangelical party met for consultation, one looked to another in\r\nblank dismay. From one to another passed the inquiry, “What is to be\r\ndone?” Mighty issues for the world were at stake. “Shall the chiefs of the\r\nReformation submit, and accept the edict? How easily might the Reformers\r\nat this crisis, which was truly a tremendous one, have argued themselves\r\ninto a wrong course! How many plausible pretexts and fair reasons might\r\nthey have found for submission! The Lutheran princes were guaranteed the\r\nfree exercise of their religion. The same boon was extended to all those\r\nof their subjects who, prior to the passing of the measure, had embraced\r\nthe reformed views. Ought not this to content them? How many perils would\r\nsubmission avoid! On what unknown hazards and conflicts would opposition\r\nlaunch them! Who knows what opportunities the future may bring? Let us\r\nembrace peace; let us seize the olive-branch Rome holds out, and close the\r\nwounds of Germany. With arguments like these might the Reformers have\r\njustified their adoption of a course which would have assuredly issued in\r\nno long time in the overthrow of their cause.\r\n\r\n“Happily they looked at the principle on which this arrangement was based,\r\nand they acted in faith. What was that principle? It was the right of Rome\r\nto coerce conscience and forbid free inquiry. But were not themselves and\r\ntheir Protestant subjects to enjoy religious freedom? Yes, as a favor\r\nspecially stipulated for in the arrangement, but not as a right. As to all\r\noutside that arrangement, the great principle of authority was to rule;\r\nconscience was out of court; Rome was infallible judge, and must be\r\nobeyed. The acceptance of the proposed arrangement would have been a\r\nvirtual admission that religious liberty ought to be confined to reformed\r\nSaxony; and as to all the rest of Christendom, free inquiry and the\r\nprofession of the reformed faith were crimes, and must be visited with the\r\ndungeon and the stake. Could they consent to localize religious liberty?\r\nto have it proclaimed that the Reformation had made its last convert? had\r\nsubjugated its last acre? and that wherever Rome bore sway at this hour,\r\nthere her dominion was to be perpetuated? Could the Reformers have pleaded\r\nthat they were innocent of the blood of those hundreds and thousands who,\r\nin pursuance of this arrangement, would have to yield up their lives in\r\npopish lands? This would have been to betray, at that supreme hour, the\r\ncause of the gospel and the liberties of Christendom.”(289) Rather would\r\nthey “sacrifice everything, even their states, their crowns, and their\r\nlives.”(290)\r\n\r\n“Let us reject this decree,” said the princes. “In matters of conscience\r\nthe majority has no power.” The deputies declared: “It is to the decree of\r\n1526 that we are indebted for the peace that the empire enjoys: its\r\nabolition would fill Germany with troubles and divisions. The Diet is\r\nincompetent to do more than preserve religious liberty until the council\r\nmeets.”(291) To protect liberty of conscience is the duty of the state,\r\nand this is the limit of its authority in matters of religion. Every\r\nsecular government that attempts to regulate or enforce religious\r\nobservances by civil authority, is sacrificing the very principle for\r\nwhich the evangelical Christians so nobly struggled.\r\n\r\nThe papists determined to put down what they termed “daring obstinacy.”\r\nThey began by endeavoring to cause divisions among the supporters of the\r\nReformation, and to intimidate all who had not openly declared in its\r\nfavor. The representatives of the free cities were at last summoned before\r\nthe Diet, and required to declare whether they would accede to the terms\r\nof the proposition. They pleaded for delay, but in vain. When brought to\r\nthe test, nearly one half their number sided with the Reformers. Those who\r\nthus refused to sacrifice liberty of conscience and the right of\r\nindividual judgment, well knew that their position marked them for future\r\ncriticism, condemnation, and persecution. Said one of the delegates, “We\r\nmust either deny the word of God, or—be burnt.”(292)\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand, the emperor’s representative at the Diet, saw that the\r\ndecree would cause serious divisions unless the princes could be induced\r\nto accept and sustain it. He therefore tried the art of persuasion, well\r\nknowing that to employ force with such men would only render them the more\r\ndetermined. He “begged the princes to accept the decree, assuring them\r\nthat the emperor would be exceedingly pleased with them.” But these\r\nfaithful men acknowledged an authority above that of earthly rulers, and\r\nthey answered calmly, “We will obey the emperor in everything that may\r\ncontribute to maintain peace and the honor of God.”(293)\r\n\r\nIn the presence of the Diet, the king at last announced to the elector and\r\nhis friends that the edict “was about to be drawn up in the form of an\r\nimperial decree,” and that “their only remaining course was to submit to\r\nthe majority.” Having thus spoken, he withdrew from the assembly, giving\r\nthe Reformers no opportunity for deliberation or reply. “To no purpose\r\nthey sent a deputation entreating the king to return.” To their\r\nremonstrances he answered only, “It is a settled affair; submission is all\r\nthat remains.”(294)\r\n\r\nThe imperial party were convinced that the Christian princes would adhere\r\nto the Holy Scriptures as superior to human doctrines and requirements;\r\nand they knew that wherever this principle was accepted, the papacy would\r\neventually be overthrown. But, like thousands since their time, looking\r\nonly “at the things which are seen,” they flattered themselves that the\r\ncause of the emperor and the pope was strong, and that of the Reformers\r\nweak. Had the Reformers depended upon human aid alone, they would have\r\nbeen as powerless as the papists supposed. But though weak in numbers, and\r\nat variance with Rome, they had their strength. They appealed “from the\r\nreport of the Diet to the word of God, and from the emperor Charles to\r\nJesus Christ, the King of kings and Lord of lords.”(295)\r\n\r\nAs Ferdinand had refused to regard their conscientious convictions, the\r\nprinces decided not to heed his absence, but to bring their Protest before\r\nthe national council without delay. A solemn declaration was therefore\r\ndrawn up, and presented to the Diet:\r\n\r\n“We protest by these presents, before God, our only Creator, Preserver,\r\nRedeemer, and Saviour, and who will one day be our Judge, as well as\r\nbefore all men and all creatures, that we, for us and for our people,\r\nneither consent nor adhere in any manner whatsoever to the proposed\r\ndecree, in anything that is contrary to God, to His holy word, to our\r\nright conscience, to the salvation of our souls.”\r\n\r\n“What! we ratify this edict! We assert that when Almighty God calls a man\r\nto His knowledge, this man nevertheless cannot receive the knowledge of\r\nGod?” “There is no sure doctrine but such as is conformable to the word of\r\nGod.... The Lord forbids the teaching of any other doctrine.... The Holy\r\nScriptures ought to be explained by other and clearer texts; ... this holy\r\nbook is, in all things necessary for the Christian, easy of understanding,\r\nand calculated to scatter the darkness. We are resolved, with the grace of\r\nGod, to maintain the pure and exclusive preaching of His only word, such\r\nas it is contained in the biblical books of the Old and New Testaments,\r\nwithout adding anything thereto that may be contrary to it. This Word is\r\nthe only truth; it is the sure rule of all doctrine and of all life, and\r\ncan never fail or deceive us. He who builds on this foundation shall stand\r\nagainst all the powers of hell, while all the human vanities that are set\r\nup against it shall fall before the face of God.”\r\n\r\n“For this reason we reject the yoke that is imposed on us.” “At the same\r\ntime we are in expectation that his imperial majesty will behave toward us\r\nlike a Christian prince who loves God above all things; and we declare\r\nourselves ready to pay unto him, as well as unto you, gracious lords, all\r\nthe affection and obedience that are our just and legitimate duty.”(296)\r\n\r\nA deep impression was made upon the Diet. The majority were filled with\r\namazement and alarm at the boldness of the protesters. The future appeared\r\nto them stormy and uncertain. Dissension, strife, and bloodshed seemed\r\ninevitable. But the Reformers, assured of the justice of their cause, and\r\nrelying upon the arm of Omnipotence, were “full of courage and firmness.”\r\n\r\n“The principles contained in this celebrated Protest ... constitute the\r\nvery essence of Protestantism. Now this Protest opposes two abuses of man\r\nin matters of faith: the first is the intrusion of the civil magistrate,\r\nand the second the arbitrary authority of the church. Instead of these\r\nabuses, Protestantism sets the power of conscience above the magistrate,\r\nand the authority of the word of God above the visible church. In the\r\nfirst place, it rejects the civil power in divine things, and says with\r\nthe prophets and apostles, ‘_We must obey God rather than man._’ In\r\npresence of the crown of Charles the Fifth, it uplifts the crown of Jesus\r\nChrist. But it goes farther: it lays down the principle that all human\r\nteaching should be subordinate to the oracles of God.”(297) The protesters\r\nhad moreover affirmed their right to utter freely their convictions of\r\ntruth. They would not only believe and obey, but teach what the word of\r\nGod presents, and they denied the right of priest or magistrate to\r\ninterfere. The Protest of Spires was a solemn witness against religious\r\nintolerance, and an assertion of the right of all men to worship God\r\naccording to the dictates of their own consciences.\r\n\r\nThe declaration had been made. It was written in the memory of thousands,\r\nand registered in the books of heaven, where no effort of man could erase\r\nit. All evangelical Germany adopted the Protest as the expression of its\r\nfaith. Everywhere men beheld in this declaration the promise of a new and\r\nbetter era. Said one of the princes to the Protestants of Spires, “May the\r\nAlmighty, who has given you grace to confess energetically, freely, and\r\nfearlessly, preserve you in that Christian firmness until the day of\r\neternity.”(298)\r\n\r\nHad the Reformation, after attaining a degree of success, consented to\r\ntemporize to secure favor with the world, it would have been untrue to God\r\nand to itself, and would thus have insured its own destruction. The\r\nexperience of these noble Reformers contains a lesson for all succeeding\r\nages. Satan’s manner of working against God and His word has not changed;\r\nhe is still as much opposed to the Scriptures being made the guide of life\r\nas in the sixteenth century. In our time there is a wide departure from\r\ntheir doctrines and precepts, and there is need of a return to the great\r\nProtestant principle,—the Bible, and the Bible only, as the rule of faith\r\nand duty. Satan is still working through every means which he can control\r\nto destroy religious liberty. The antichristian power which the protesters\r\nof Spires rejected, is now with renewed vigor seeking to re-establish its\r\nlost supremacy. The same unswerving adherence to the word of God\r\nmanifested at that crisis of the Reformation, is the only hope of reform\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nThere appeared tokens of danger to the Protestants; there were tokens,\r\nalso, that the divine hand was stretched out to protect the faithful. It\r\nwas about this time that “Melanchthon hastily conducted through the\r\nstreets of Spires toward the Rhine his friend Simon Grynæus, pressing him\r\nto cross the river. The latter was astonished at such precipitation. ‘An\r\nold man of grave and solemn air, but who is unknown to me,’ said\r\nMelanchthon, ‘appeared before me and said, In a minute officers of justice\r\nwill be sent by Ferdinand to arrest Grynæus.’ ”\r\n\r\nDuring the day, Grynæus had been scandalized at a sermon by Faber, a\r\nleading papal doctor; and at the close, remonstrated with him for\r\ndefending “certain detestable errors.” “Faber dissembled his anger, but\r\nimmediately after repaired to the king, from whom he had obtained an order\r\nagainst the importunate professor of Heidelberg. Melanchthon doubted not\r\nthat God had saved his friend by sending one of His holy angels to\r\nforewarn him.\r\n\r\n“Motionless on the banks of the Rhine, he waited until the waters of that\r\nstream had rescued Grynæus from his persecutors. ‘At last,’ cried\r\nMelanchthon, as he saw him on the opposite side, ‘at last he is torn from\r\nthe cruel jaws of those who thirst for innocent blood.’ When he returned\r\nto his house, Melanchthon was informed that officers in search of Grynæus\r\nhad ransacked it from top to bottom.”(299)\r\n\r\nThe Reformation was to be brought into greater prominence before the\r\nmighty ones of the earth. The evangelical princes had been denied a\r\nhearing by King Ferdinand; but they were to be granted an opportunity to\r\npresent their cause in the presence of the emperor and the assembled\r\ndignitaries of church and state. To quiet the dissensions which disturbed\r\nthe empire, Charles V., in the year following the Protest of Spires,\r\nconvoked a Diet at Augsburg, over which he announced his intention to\r\npreside in person. Thither the Protestant leaders were summoned.\r\n\r\nGreat dangers threatened the Reformation; but its advocates still trusted\r\ntheir cause with God, and pledged themselves to be firm to the gospel. The\r\nelector of Saxony was urged by his councilors not to appear at the Diet.\r\nThe emperor, they said, required the attendance of the princes in order to\r\ndraw them into a snare. “Is it not risking everything to go and shut\r\noneself up within the walls of a city with a powerful enemy?” But others\r\nnobly declared, “Let the princes only comport themselves with courage, and\r\nGod’s cause is saved.” “God is faithful; He will not abandon us,”(300)\r\nsaid Luther. The elector set out, with his retinue, for Augsburg. All were\r\nacquainted with the dangers that menaced him, and many went forward with\r\ngloomy countenance and troubled heart. But Luther, who accompanied them as\r\nfar as Coburg, revived their sinking faith by singing the hymn, written on\r\nthat journey, “A strong tower is our God.” Many an anxious foreboding was\r\nbanished, many a heavy heart lightened, at the sound of the inspiring\r\nstrains.\r\n\r\nThe reformed princes had determined upon having a statement of their views\r\nin systematic form, with the evidence from the Scriptures, to present\r\nbefore the Diet; and the task of its preparation was committed to Luther,\r\nMelanchthon, and their associates. This Confession was accepted by the\r\nProtestants as an exposition of their faith, and they assembled to affix\r\ntheir names to the important document. It was a solemn and trying time.\r\nThe Reformers were solicitous that their cause should not be confounded\r\nwith political questions; they felt that the Reformation should exercise\r\nno other influence than that which proceeds from the word of God. As the\r\nChristian princes advanced to sign the Confession, Melanchthon interposed,\r\nsaying, “It is for the theologians and ministers to propose these things;\r\nlet us reserve for other matters the authority of the mighty ones of the\r\nearth.” “God forbid,” replied John of Saxony, “that you should exclude me.\r\nI am resolved to do what is right, without troubling myself about my\r\ncrown. I desire to confess the Lord. My electoral hat and my ermine are\r\nnot so precious to me as the cross of Jesus Christ.” Having thus spoken,\r\nhe wrote down his name. Said another of the princes as he took the pen,\r\n“If the honor of my Lord Jesus Christ requires it, I am ready ... to leave\r\nmy goods and life behind.” “I would rather renounce my subjects and my\r\nstates, rather quit the country of my fathers staff in hand,” he\r\ncontinued, “than receive any other doctrine than that which is contained\r\nin this Confession.”(301) Such was the faith and daring of those men of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nThe appointed time came to appear before the emperor. Charles V., seated\r\nupon his throne, surrounded by the electors and the princes, gave audience\r\nto the Protestant Reformers. The confession of their faith was read. In\r\nthat august assembly the truths of the gospel were clearly set forth, and\r\nthe errors of the papal church were pointed out. Well has that day been\r\npronounced “the greatest day of the Reformation, and one of the most\r\nglorious in the history of Christianity and of mankind.”(302)\r\n\r\nBut a few years had passed since the monk of Wittenberg stood alone at\r\nWorms before the national council. Now in his stead were the noblest and\r\nmost powerful princes of the empire. Luther had been forbidden to appear\r\nat Augsburg, but he had been present by his words and prayers. “I am\r\noverjoyed,” he wrote, “that I have lived until this hour, in which Christ\r\nhas been publicly exalted by such illustrious confessors, and in so\r\nglorious an assembly.”(303) Thus was fulfilled what the Scripture says, “I\r\nwill speak of Thy testimonies before kings.”(304)\r\n\r\nIn the days of Paul, the gospel for which he was imprisoned was thus\r\nbrought before the princes and nobles of the imperial city. So on this\r\noccasion, that which the emperor had forbidden to be preached from the\r\npulpit, was proclaimed in the palace; what many had regarded as unfit even\r\nfor servants to listen to, was heard with wonder by the masters and lords\r\nof the empire. Kings and great men were the auditory, crowned princes were\r\nthe preachers, and the sermon was the royal truth of God. “Since the\r\napostolic age,” says a writer, “there has never been a greater work or a\r\nmore magnificent confession.”(305)\r\n\r\n“All that the Lutherans have said is true; we cannot deny it,” declared a\r\npapist bishop. “Can you refute by sound reasons the Confession made by the\r\nelector and his allies?” asked another, of Doctor Eck. “With the writings\r\nof the apostles and prophets—no!” was the reply; “but with those of the\r\nFathers and of the councils—yes!” “I understand,” responded the\r\nquestioner. “The Lutherans, according to you, are in Scripture, and we are\r\noutside.”(306)\r\n\r\nSome of the princes of Germany were won to the reformed faith. The emperor\r\nhimself declared that the Protestant articles were but the truth. The\r\nConfession was translated into many languages, and circulated through all\r\nEurope, and it has been accepted by millions in succeeding generations as\r\nthe expression of their faith.\r\n\r\nGod’s faithful servants were not toiling alone. While “principalities and\r\npowers and wicked spirits in high places” were leagued against them, the\r\nLord did not forsake His people. Could their eyes have been opened, they\r\nwould have seen as marked evidence of divine presence and aid as was\r\ngranted to a prophet of old. When Elisha’s servant pointed his master to\r\nthe hostile army surrounding them, and cutting off all opportunity for\r\nescape, the prophet prayed, “Lord, I pray Thee, open his eyes, that he may\r\nsee.”(307) And, lo, the mountain was filled with chariots and horses of\r\nfire, the army of heaven stationed to protect the man of God. Thus did\r\nangels guard the workers in the cause of the Reformation.\r\n\r\nOne of the principles most firmly maintained by Luther was that there\r\nshould be no resort to secular power in support of the Reformation, and no\r\nappeal to arms for its defense. He rejoiced that the gospel was confessed\r\nby princes of the empire; but when they proposed to unite in a defensive\r\nleague, he declared that “the doctrine of the gospel should be defended by\r\n_God_ alone.... The less man meddled in the work, the more striking would\r\nbe God’s intervention in its behalf. All the politic precautions suggested\r\nwere, in his view, attributable to unworthy fear and sinful\r\nmistrust.”(308)\r\n\r\nWhen powerful foes were uniting to overthrow the reformed faith, and\r\nthousands of swords seemed about to be unsheathed against it, Luther\r\nwrote: “Satan is putting forth his fury; ungodly pontiffs are conspiring;\r\nand we are threatened with war. Exhort the people to contend valiantly\r\nbefore the throne of the Lord, by faith and prayer, so that our enemies,\r\nvanquished by the Spirit of God, may be constrained to peace. Our chief\r\nwant, our chief labor, is prayer; let the people know that they are now\r\nexposed to the edge of the sword and to the rage of Satan, and let them\r\npray.”(309)\r\n\r\nAgain, at a later date, referring to the league contemplated by the\r\nreformed princes, Luther declared that the only weapon employed in this\r\nwarfare should be “the sword of the Spirit.” He wrote to the elector of\r\nSaxony: “We cannot on our conscience approve of the proposed alliance. We\r\nwould rather die ten times than see our gospel cause one drop of blood to\r\nbe shed. Our part is to be like lambs of the slaughter. The cross of\r\nChrist must be borne. Let your highness be without fear. We shall do more\r\nby our prayers than all our enemies by their boastings. Only let not your\r\nhands be stained with the blood of your brethren. If the emperor requires\r\nus to be given up to his tribunals, we are ready to appear. You cannot\r\ndefend our faith: each one should believe at his own risk and peril.”(310)\r\n\r\nFrom the secret place of prayer came the power that shook the world in the\r\nGreat Reformation. There with holy calmness, the servants of the Lord set\r\ntheir feet upon the rock of His promises. During the struggle at Augsburg,\r\nLuther “did not pass a day without devoting three hours at least to\r\nprayer, and they were hours selected from those the most favorable to\r\nstudy.” In the privacy of his chamber he was heard to pour out his soul\r\nbefore God in words “full of adoration, fear, and hope, as when one speaks\r\nto a friend.” “I know that Thou art our Father and our God,” he said, “and\r\nthat Thou wilt scatter the persecutors of Thy children; for Thou art\r\nThyself endangered with us. All this matter is Thine, and it is only by\r\nThy constraint that we have put our hands to it. Defend us, then, O\r\nFather!”(311)\r\n\r\nTo Melanchthon, who was crushed under the burden of anxiety and fear, he\r\nwrote: “Grace and peace in Christ—in Christ, I say, and not in the world.\r\nAmen. I hate with exceeding hatred those extreme cares which consume you.\r\nIf the cause is unjust, abandon it; if the cause is just, why should we\r\nbelie the promises of Him who commands us to sleep without fear?... Christ\r\nwill not be wanting to the work of justice and of truth. He lives, He\r\nreigns; what fear, then, can we have?”(312)\r\n\r\nGod did listen to the cries of His servants. He gave to princes and\r\nministers grace and courage to maintain the truth against the rulers of\r\nthe darkness of this world. Saith the Lord, “Behold, I lay in Zion a chief\r\ncorner-stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on Him shall not be\r\nconfounded.”(313) The Protestant Reformers had built on Christ, and the\r\ngates of hell could not prevail against them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12. THE FRENCH REFORMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nThe Protest of Spires and the Confession at Augsburg, which marked the\r\ntriumph of the Reformation in Germany, were followed by years of conflict\r\nand darkness. Weakened by divisions among its supporters, and assailed by\r\npowerful foes, Protestantism seemed destined to be utterly destroyed.\r\nThousands sealed their testimony with their blood. Civil war broke out;\r\nthe Protestant cause was betrayed by one of its leading adherents; the\r\nnoblest of the reformed princes fell into the hands of the emperor, and\r\nwere dragged as captives from town to town. But in the moment of his\r\napparent triumph, the emperor was smitten with defeat. He saw the prey\r\nwrested from his grasp, and he was forced at last to grant toleration to\r\nthe doctrines which it had been the ambition of his life to destroy. He\r\nhad staked his kingdom, his treasures, and life itself, upon the crushing\r\nout of the heresy. Now he saw his armies wasted by battle, his treasuries\r\ndrained, his many kingdoms threatened by revolt, while everywhere the\r\nfaith which he had vainly endeavored to suppress, was extending. Charles\r\nV. had been battling against omnipotent power. God had said, “Let there be\r\nlight,” but the emperor had sought to keep the darkness unbroken. His\r\npurposes had failed; and in premature old age, worn out with the long\r\nstruggle, he abdicated the throne, and buried himself in a cloister.\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland, as in Germany, there came dark days for the Reformation.\r\nWhile many cantons accepted the reformed faith, others clung with blind\r\npersistence to the creed of Rome. Their persecution of those who desired\r\nto receive the truth, finally gave rise to civil war. Zwingle and many who\r\nhad united with him in reform, fell on the bloody field of Cappel.\r\nŒcolampadius, overcome by these terrible disasters, soon after died. Rome\r\nwas triumphant, and in many places seemed about to recover all that she\r\nhad lost. But He whose counsels are from everlasting had not forsaken His\r\ncause or His people. His hand would bring deliverance for them. In other\r\nlands He had raised up laborers to carry forward the reform.\r\n\r\nIn France, before the name of Luther had been heard as a Reformer, the day\r\nhad already begun to break. One of the first to catch the light was the\r\naged Lefevre, a man of extensive learning, a professor in the University\r\nof Paris, and a sincere and zealous papist. In his researches into ancient\r\nliterature his attention was directed to the Bible, and he introduced its\r\nstudy among his students.\r\n\r\nLefevre was an enthusiastic adorer of the saints, and he had undertaken to\r\nprepare a history of the saints and martyrs, as given in the legends of\r\nthe church. This was a work which involved great labor; but he had already\r\nmade considerable progress in it, when, thinking that he might obtain\r\nuseful assistance from the Bible, he began its study with this object.\r\nHere indeed he found saints brought to view, but not such as figured in\r\nthe Roman calendar. A flood of divine light broke in upon his mind. In\r\namazement and disgust he turned away from his self-appointed task, and\r\ndevoted himself to the word of God. The precious truths which he there\r\ndiscovered, he soon began to teach.\r\n\r\nIn 1512, before either Luther or Zwingle had begun the work of reform,\r\nLefevre wrote: “It is God who gives us, by faith, that righteousness which\r\nby grace alone justifies to eternal life.”(314) Dwelling upon the\r\nmysteries of redemption, he exclaimed, “Oh, the unspeakable greatness of\r\nthat exchange,—the Sinless One is condemned, and he who is guilty goes\r\nfree; the Blessing bears the curse, and the cursed is brought into\r\nblessing; the Life dies, and the dead live; the Glory is whelmed in\r\ndarkness, and he who knew nothing but confusion of face is clothed with\r\nglory.”(315)\r\n\r\nAnd while teaching that the glory of salvation belongs solely to God, he\r\nalso declared that the duty of obedience belongs to man. “If thou art a\r\nmember of Christ’s church,” he said, “thou art a member of His body; if\r\nthou art of His body, then thou art full of the divine nature.... Oh, if\r\nmen could but enter into the understanding of this privilege, how purely,\r\nchastely, and holily would they live, and how contemptible, when compared\r\nwith the glory within them,—that glory which the eye of flesh cannot\r\nsee,—would they deem all the glory of this world.”(316)\r\n\r\nThere were some among Lefevre’s students who listened eagerly to his\r\nwords, and who, long after the teacher’s voice should be silenced, were to\r\ncontinue to declare the truth. Such was William Farel. The son of pious\r\nparents, and educated to accept with implicit faith the teachings of the\r\nchurch, he might, with the apostle Paul, have declared concerning himself,\r\n“After the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.”(317) A\r\ndevoted Romanist, he burned with zeal to destroy all who should dare to\r\noppose the church. “I would gnash my teeth like a furious wolf,” he\r\nafterward said, referring to this period of his life, “when I heard any\r\none speaking against the pope.”(318) He had been untiring in his adoration\r\nof the saints, in company with Lefevre making the round of the churches of\r\nParis, worshiping at the altars, and adorning with gifts the holy shrines.\r\nBut these observances could not bring peace of soul. Conviction of sin\r\nfastened upon him, which all the acts of penance that he practised, failed\r\nto banish. As to a voice from heaven, he listened to the Reformer’s words:\r\n“Salvation is of grace.” “The Innocent One is condemned, and the criminal\r\nis acquitted.” “It is the cross of Christ alone that openeth the gates of\r\nheaven, and shutteth the gates of hell.”(319)\r\n\r\nFarel joyfully accepted the truth. By a conversion like that of Paul, he\r\nturned from the bondage of tradition to the liberty of the sons of God.\r\n“Instead of the murderous heart of a ravening wolf, he came back,” he\r\nsays, “quietly, like a meek and harmless lamb, having his heart entirely\r\nwithdrawn from the pope, and given to Jesus Christ.”(320)\r\n\r\nWhile Lefevre continued to spread the light among his students, Farel, as\r\nzealous in the cause of Christ as he had been in that of the pope, went\r\nforth to declare the truth in public. A dignitary of the church, the\r\nbishop of Meaux, soon after united with them. Other teachers who ranked\r\nhigh for their ability and learning, joined in proclaiming the gospel, and\r\nit won adherents among all classes, from the homes of artisans and\r\npeasants to the palace of the king. The sister of Francis I., then the\r\nreigning monarch, accepted the reformed faith. The king himself, and the\r\nqueen mother, appeared for a time to regard it with favor, and with high\r\nhopes the Reformers looked forward to the time when France should be won\r\nto the gospel.\r\n\r\nBut their hopes were not to be realized. Trial and persecution awaited the\r\ndisciples of Christ. This, however, was mercifully veiled from their eyes.\r\nA time of peace intervened, that they might gain strength to meet the\r\ntempest; and the Reformation made rapid progress. The bishop of Meaux\r\nlabored zealously in his own diocese to instruct both the clergy and the\r\npeople. Ignorant and immoral priests were removed, and, so far as\r\npossible, replaced by men of learning and piety. The bishop greatly\r\ndesired that his people might have access to the word of God for\r\nthemselves, and this was soon accomplished. Lefevre undertook the\r\ntranslation of the New Testament; and at the very time when Luther’s\r\nGerman Bible was issuing from the press in Wittenberg, the French New\r\nTestament was published at Meaux. The bishop spared no labor or expense to\r\ncirculate it in his parishes, and soon the peasants of Meaux were in\r\npossession of the Holy Scriptures.\r\n\r\nAs travelers perishing from thirst welcome with joy a living water-spring,\r\nso did these souls receive the message of heaven. The laborers in the\r\nfield, the artisans in the workshop, cheered their daily toil by talking\r\nof the precious truths of the Bible. At evening, instead of resorting to\r\nthe wine shops, they assembled in one another’s homes to read God’s word\r\nand join in prayer and praise. A great change was soon manifest in these\r\ncommunities. Though belonging to the humblest class, an unlearned and\r\nhard-working peasantry, the reforming, uplifting power of divine grace was\r\nseen in their lives. Humble, loving, and holy, they stood as witnesses to\r\nwhat the gospel will accomplish for those who receive it in sincerity.\r\n\r\nThe light kindled at Meaux shed its beams afar. Every day the number of\r\nconverts was increasing. The rage of the hierarchy was for a time held in\r\ncheck by the king, who despised the narrow bigotry of the monks; but the\r\npapal leaders finally prevailed. Now the stake was set up. The bishop of\r\nMeaux, forced to choose between the fire and recantation, accepted the\r\neasier path; but notwithstanding the leader’s fall, his flock remained\r\nsteadfast. Many witnessed for the truth amid the flames. By their courage\r\nand fidelity at the stake, these humble Christians spoke to thousands who\r\nin days of peace had never heard their testimony.\r\n\r\nIt was not alone the humble and the poor, that amid suffering and scorn\r\ndared to bear witness for Christ. In the lordly halls of the castle and\r\nthe palace, there were kingly souls by whom truth was valued above wealth\r\nor rank or even life. Kingly armor concealed a loftier and more steadfast\r\nspirit than did the bishop’s robe and mitre. Louis de Berquin was of noble\r\nbirth. A brave and courtly knight, he was devoted to study, polished in\r\nmanners, and of blameless morals. “He was,” says a writer, “a great\r\nfollower of the papistical constitutions, and a great hearer of masses and\r\nsermons; ... and he crowned all his other virtues by holding Lutheranism\r\nin special abhorrence.” But, like so many others, providentially guided to\r\nthe Bible, he was amazed to find there, “not the doctrines of Rome, but\r\nthe doctrines of Luther.”(321) Henceforth he gave himself with entire\r\ndevotion to the cause of the gospel.\r\n\r\n“The most learned of the nobles of France,” his genius and eloquence, his\r\nindomitable courage and heroic zeal, and his influence at court,—for he\r\nwas a favorite with the king,—caused him to be regarded by many as one\r\ndestined to be the Reformer of his country. Said Beza, “Berquin would have\r\nbeen a second Luther, had he found in Francis I. a second elector.” “He is\r\nworse than Luther,”(322) cried the papists. More dreaded he was indeed by\r\nthe Romanists of France. They thrust him into prison as a heretic, but he\r\nwas set at liberty by the king. For years the struggle continued. Francis,\r\nwavering between Rome and the Reformation, alternately tolerated and\r\nrestrained the fierce zeal of the monks. Berquin was three times\r\nimprisoned by the papal authorities, only to be released by the monarch,\r\nwho, in admiration of his genius and his nobility of character, refused to\r\nsacrifice him to the malice of the hierarchy.\r\n\r\nBerquin was repeatedly warned of the danger that threatened him in France,\r\nand urged to follow the steps of those who had found safety in voluntary\r\nexile. The timid and time-serving Erasmus, who with all the splendor of\r\nhis scholarship failed of that moral greatness which holds life and honor\r\nsubservient to truth, wrote to Berquin: “Ask to be sent as ambassador to\r\nsome foreign country; go and travel in Germany. You know Beda and such as\r\nhe—he is a thousand-headed monster, darting venom on every side. Your\r\nenemies are named legion. Were your cause better than that of Jesus\r\nChrist, they will not let you go till they have miserably destroyed you.\r\nDo not trust too much to the king’s protection. At all events, _do not\r\ncompromise me_ with the faculty of theology.”(323)\r\n\r\nBut as dangers thickened, Berquin’s zeal only waxed the stronger. So far\r\nfrom adopting the politic and self-serving counsel of Erasmus, he\r\ndetermined upon still bolder measures. He would not only stand in defense\r\nof the truth, but he would attack error. The charge of heresy which the\r\nRomanists were seeking to fasten upon him, he would rivet upon them. The\r\nmost active and bitter of his opponents were the learned doctors and monks\r\nof the theological department in the great University of Paris, one of the\r\nhighest ecclesiastical authorities both in the city and the nation. From\r\nthe writings of these doctors, Berquin drew twelve propositions which he\r\npublicly declared to be “opposed to the Bible, and heretical;” and he\r\nappealed to the king to act as judge in the controversy.\r\n\r\nThe monarch, not loath to bring into contrast the power and acuteness of\r\nthe opposing champions, and glad of an opportunity of humbling the pride\r\nof these haughty monks, bade the Romanists defend their cause by the\r\nBible. This weapon, they well knew, would avail them little; imprisonment,\r\ntorture, and the stake were arms which they better understood how to\r\nwield. Now the tables were turned, and they saw themselves about to fall\r\ninto the pit into which they had hoped to plunge Berquin. In amazement\r\nthey looked about them for some way of escape.\r\n\r\n“Just at that time an image of the Virgin at the corner of one of the\r\nstreets, was mutilated.” There was great excitement in the city. Crowds of\r\npeople flocked to the place, with expressions of mourning and indignation.\r\nThe king also was deeply moved. Here was an advantage which the monks\r\ncould turn to good account, and they were quick to improve it. “These are\r\nthe fruits of the doctrines of Berquin,” they cried. “All is about to be\r\noverthrown—religion, the laws, the throne itself—by this Lutheran\r\nconspiracy.”(324)\r\n\r\nAgain Berquin was apprehended. The king withdrew from Paris, and the monks\r\nwere thus left free to work their will. The Reformer was tried, and\r\ncondemned to die, and lest Francis should even yet interpose to save him,\r\nthe sentence was executed on the very day it was pronounced. At noon\r\nBerquin was conducted to the place of death. An immense throng gathered to\r\nwitness the event, and there were many who saw with astonishment and\r\nmisgiving that the victim had been chosen from the best and bravest of the\r\nnoble families of France. Amazement, indignation, scorn, and bitter hatred\r\ndarkened the faces of that surging crowd; but upon one face no shadow\r\nrested. The martyr’s thoughts were far from that scene of tumult; he was\r\nconscious only of the presence of his Lord.\r\n\r\nThe wretched tumbrel upon which he rode, the frowning faces of his\r\npersecutors, the dreadful death to which he was going,—these he heeded\r\nnot; He who liveth and was dead, and is alive forevermore, and hath the\r\nkeys of death and of hell, was beside him. Berquin’s countenance was\r\nradiant with the light and peace of heaven. He had attired himself in\r\ngoodly raiment, wearing “a cloak of velvet, a doublet of satin and damask,\r\nand golden hose.”(325) He was about to testify to his faith in presence of\r\nthe King of kings and the witnessing universe, and no token of mourning\r\nshould belie his joy.\r\n\r\nAs the procession moved slowly through the crowded streets, the people\r\nmarked with wonder the unclouded peace, the joyous triumph, of his look\r\nand bearing. “He is,” they said, “like one who sits in a temple, and\r\nmeditates on holy things.”(326)\r\n\r\nAt the stake, Berquin endeavored to address a few words to the people; but\r\nthe monks, fearing the result, began to shout, and the soldiers to clash\r\ntheir arms, and their clamor drowned the martyr’s voice. Thus in 1529, the\r\nhighest literary and ecclesiastical authority of cultured Paris “set the\r\npopulace of 1793 the base example of stifling on the scaffold the sacred\r\nwords of the dying.”(327)\r\n\r\nBerquin was strangled, and his body was consumed in the flames. The\r\ntidings of his death caused sorrow to the friends of the Reformation\r\nthroughout France. But his example was not lost. “We too are ready,” said\r\nthe witnesses for the truth, “to meet death cheerfully, setting our eyes\r\non the life that is to come.”(328)\r\n\r\nDuring the persecution at Meaux, the teachers of the reformed faith were\r\ndeprived of their license to preach, and they departed to other fields.\r\nLefevre after a time made his way to Germany. Farel returned to his native\r\ntown in eastern France, to spread the light in the home of his childhood.\r\nAlready tidings had been received of what was going on at Meaux, and the\r\ntruth, which he taught with fearless zeal, found listeners. Soon the\r\nauthorities were roused to silence him, and he was banished from the city.\r\nThough he could no longer labor publicly, he traversed the plains and\r\nvillages, teaching in private dwellings and in secluded meadows, and\r\nfinding shelter in the forests and among the rocky caverns which had been\r\nhis haunts in boyhood. God was preparing him for greater trials. “The\r\ncrosses, persecutions, and machinations of Satan, of which I was\r\nforewarned, have not been wanting,” he said; “they are even much severer\r\nthan I could have borne of myself; but God is my Father; He has provided\r\nand always will provide me the strength which I require.”(329)\r\n\r\nAs in apostolic days, persecution had “fallen out rather unto the\r\nfurtherance of the gospel.”(330) Driven from Paris and Meaux, “they that\r\nwere scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word.”(331) And thus\r\nthe light found its way into many of the remote provinces of France.\r\n\r\nGod was still preparing workers to extend His cause. In one of the schools\r\nof Paris was a thoughtful, quiet youth, already giving evidence of a\r\npowerful and penetrating mind, and no less marked for the blamelessness of\r\nhis life than for intellectual ardor and religious devotion. His genius\r\nand application soon made him the pride of the college, and it was\r\nconfidently anticipated that John Calvin would become one of the ablest\r\nand most honored defenders of the church. But a ray of divine light\r\npenetrated even within the walls of scholasticism and superstition by\r\nwhich Calvin was inclosed. He heard of the new doctrines with a shudder,\r\nnothing doubting that the heretics deserved the fire to which they were\r\ngiven. Yet all unwittingly he was brought face to face with the heresy,\r\nand forced to test the power of Romish theology to combat the Protestant\r\nteaching.\r\n\r\nA cousin of Calvin’s, who had joined the Reformers, was in Paris. The two\r\nkinsmen often met, and discussed together the matters that were disturbing\r\nChristendom. “There are but two religions in the world,” said Olivetan,\r\nthe Protestant. “The one class of religions are those which men have\r\ninvented, in all of which man saves himself by ceremonies and good works;\r\nthe other is that one religion which is revealed in the Bible, and which\r\nteaches man to look for salvation solely from the free grace of God.”\r\n\r\n“I will have none of your new doctrines,” exclaimed Calvin; “think you\r\nthat I have lived in error all my days?”(332)\r\n\r\nBut thoughts had been awakened in his mind which he could not banish at\r\nwill. Alone in his chamber he pondered upon his cousin’s words. Conviction\r\nof sin fastened upon him; he saw himself, without an intercessor, in the\r\npresence of a holy and just Judge. The mediation of saints, good works,\r\nthe ceremonies of the church, all were powerless to atone for sin. He\r\ncould see before him nothing but the blackness of eternal despair. In vain\r\nthe doctors of the church endeavored to relieve his woe. Confession,\r\npenance, were resorted to in vain; they could not reconcile the soul with\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nWhile still engaged in these fruitless struggles, Calvin, chancing one day\r\nto visit one of the public squares, witnessed there the burning of a\r\nheretic. He was filled with wonder at the expression of peace which rested\r\nupon the martyr’s countenance. Amid the tortures of that dreadful death,\r\nand under the more terrible condemnation of the church, he manifested a\r\nfaith and courage which the young student painfully contrasted with his\r\nown despair and darkness, while living in strictest obedience to the\r\nchurch. Upon the Bible, he knew, the heretics rested their faith. He\r\ndetermined to study it, and discover, if he could, the secret of their\r\njoy.\r\n\r\nIn the Bible he found Christ. “O Father,” he cried, “His sacrifice has\r\nappeased Thy wrath; His blood has washed away my impurities; His cross has\r\nborne my curse; His death has atoned for me. We had devised for ourselves\r\nmany useless follies, but Thou hast placed Thy word before me like a\r\ntorch, and Thou hast touched my heart, in order that I may hold in\r\nabomination all other merits save those of Jesus.”(333)\r\n\r\nCalvin had been educated for the priesthood. When only twelve years of age\r\nhe had been appointed to the chaplaincy of a small church, and his head\r\nhad been shorn by the bishop in accordance with the canon of the church.\r\nHe did not receive consecration, nor did he fulfil the duties of a priest,\r\nbut he became a member of the clergy, holding the title of his office, and\r\nreceiving an allowance in consideration thereof.\r\n\r\nNow, feeling that he could never become a priest, he turned for a time to\r\nthe study of law, but finally abandoned this purpose, and determined to\r\ndevote his life to the gospel. But he hesitated to become a public\r\nteacher. He was naturally timid, and was burdened with a sense of the\r\nweighty responsibility of the position, and he desired still to devote\r\nhimself to study. The earnest entreaties of his friends, however, at last\r\nwon his consent. “Wonderful it is,” he said, “that one of so lowly an\r\norigin should be exalted to so great a dignity.”(334)\r\n\r\nQuietly did Calvin enter upon his work, and his words were as the dew\r\nfalling to refresh the earth. He had left Paris, and was now in a\r\nprovincial town under the protection of the princess Margaret, who, loving\r\nthe gospel, extended her protection to its disciples. Calvin was still a\r\nyouth, of gentle, unpretentious bearing. His work began with the people at\r\ntheir homes. Surrounded by the members of the household, he read the\r\nBible, and opened the truths of salvation. Those who heard the message,\r\ncarried the good news to others, and soon the teacher passed beyond the\r\ncity to the outlying towns and hamlets. To both the castle and the cabin\r\nhe found entrance, and he went forward, laying the foundation of churches\r\nthat were to yield fearless witnesses for the truth.\r\n\r\nA few months, and he was again in Paris. There was unwonted agitation in\r\nthe circle of learned men and scholars. The study of the ancient languages\r\nhad led men to the Bible, and many whose hearts were untouched by its\r\ntruths were eagerly discussing them, and even giving battle to the\r\nchampions of Romanism. Calvin, though an able combatant in the fields of\r\ntheological controversy, had a higher mission to accomplish than that of\r\nthese noisy schoolmen. The minds of men were stirred, and now was the time\r\nto open to them the truth. While the halls of the universities were filled\r\nwith the clamor of theological disputation, Calvin was making his way from\r\nhouse to house, opening the Bible to the people, and speaking to them of\r\nChrist and Him crucified.\r\n\r\nIn God’s providence, Paris was to receive another invitation to accept the\r\ngospel. The call of Lefevre and Farel had been rejected, but again the\r\nmessage was to be heard by all classes in that great capital. The king,\r\ninfluenced by political considerations, had not yet fully sided with Rome\r\nagainst the Reformation. Margaret still clung to the hope that\r\nProtestantism was to triumph in France. She resolved that the reformed\r\nfaith should be preached in Paris. During the absence of the king, she\r\nordered a Protestant minister to preach in the churches of the city. This\r\nbeing forbidden by the papal dignitaries, the princess threw open the\r\npalace. An apartment was fitted up as a chapel, and it was announced that\r\nevery day, at a specified hour, a sermon would be preached, and the people\r\nof every rank and station were invited to attend. Crowds flocked to the\r\nservice. Not only the chapel, but the ante-chambers and halls were\r\nthronged. Thousands every day assembled,—nobles, statesmen, lawyers,\r\nmerchants, and artisans. The king, instead of forbidding the assemblies,\r\nordered that two of the churches of Paris should be opened. Never before\r\nhad the city been so moved by the word of God. The spirit of life from\r\nheaven seemed to be breathed upon the people. Temperance, purity, order,\r\nand industry were taking the place of drunkenness, licentiousness, strife,\r\nand idleness.\r\n\r\nBut the hierarchy were not idle. The king still refused to interfere to\r\nstop the preaching, and they turned to the populace. No means were spared\r\nto excite the fears, the prejudices, and the fanaticism of the ignorant\r\nand superstitious multitudes. Yielding blindly to her false teachers,\r\nParis, like Jerusalem of old, knew not the time of her visitation, nor the\r\nthings which belonged unto her peace. For two years the word of God was\r\npreached in the capital; but while there were many who accepted the\r\ngospel, the majority of the people rejected it. Francis had made a show of\r\ntoleration, merely to serve his own purposes, and the papists succeeded in\r\nregaining the ascendency. Again the churches were closed, and the stake\r\nwas set up.\r\n\r\nCalvin was still in Paris, preparing himself by study, meditation, and\r\nprayer, for his future labors, and continuing to spread the light. At\r\nlast, however, suspicion fastened upon him. The authorities determined to\r\nbring him to the flames. Regarding himself as secure in his seclusion, he\r\nhad no thought of danger, when friends came hurrying to his room with the\r\nnews that officers were on their way to arrest him. At the instant a loud\r\nknocking was heard at the outer entrance. There was not a moment to be\r\nlost. Some of his friends detained the officers at the door, while others\r\nassisted the Reformer to let himself down from a window, and he rapidly\r\nmade his way to the outskirts of the city. Finding shelter in the cottage\r\nof a laborer who was a friend to the reform, he disguised himself in the\r\ngarments of his host, and shouldering a hoe, started on his journey.\r\nTraveling southward, he again found refuge in the dominions of\r\nMargaret.(335)\r\n\r\nHere for a few months he remained, safe under the protection of powerful\r\nfriends, and engaged as before in study. But his heart was set upon the\r\nevangelization of France, and he could not long remain inactive. As soon\r\nas the storm had somewhat abated, he sought a new field of labor in\r\nPoitiers, where was a university, and where already the new opinions had\r\nfound favor. Persons of all classes gladly listened to the gospel. There\r\nwas no public preaching, but in the home of the chief magistrate, in his\r\nown lodgings, and sometimes in a public garden, Calvin opened the words of\r\neternal life to those who desired to listen. After a time, as the number\r\nof hearers increased, it was thought safer to assemble outside the city. A\r\ncave in the side of a deep and narrow gorge, where trees and overhanging\r\nrocks made the seclusion still more complete, was chosen as the place of\r\nmeeting. Little companies, leaving the city by different routes, found\r\ntheir way hither. In this retired spot the Bible was read and explained.\r\nHere the Lord’s supper was celebrated for the first time by the\r\nProtestants of France. From this little church several faithful\r\nevangelists were sent out.\r\n\r\nOnce more Calvin returned to Paris. He could not even yet relinquish the\r\nhope that France as a nation would accept the Reformation. But he found\r\nalmost every door of labor closed. To teach the gospel was to take the\r\ndirect road to the stake, and he at last determined to depart to Germany.\r\nScarcely had he left France when a storm burst over the Protestants, that,\r\nhad he remained, must surely have involved him in the general ruin.\r\n\r\nThe French Reformers, eager to see their country keeping pace with Germany\r\nand Switzerland, determined to strike a bold blow against the\r\nsuperstitions of Rome, that should arouse the whole nation. Accordingly\r\nplacards attacking the mass were in one night posted all over France.\r\nInstead of advancing the reform, this zealous but ill-judged movement\r\nbrought ruin, not only upon its propagators, but upon the friends of the\r\nreformed faith throughout France. It gave the Romanists what they had long\r\ndesired,—a pretext for demanding the utter destruction of the heretics as\r\nagitators dangerous to the stability of the throne and the peace of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nBy some secret hand—whether of indiscreet friend or wily foe was never\r\nknown—one of the placards was attached to the door of the king’s private\r\nchamber. The monarch was filled with horror. In this paper, superstitions\r\nthat had received the veneration of ages were attacked with an unsparing\r\nhand. And the unexampled boldness of obtruding these plain and startling\r\nutterances into the royal presence, aroused the wrath of the king. In his\r\namazement he stood for a little time trembling and speechless. Then his\r\nrage found utterance in the terrible words: “Let all be seized without\r\ndistinction who are suspected of Lutheresy. I will exterminate them\r\nall.”(336) The die was cast. The king had determined to throw himself\r\nfully on the side of Rome.\r\n\r\nMeasures were at once taken for the arrest of every Lutheran in Paris. A\r\npoor artisan, an adherent of the reformed faith, who had been accustomed\r\nto summon the believers to their secret assemblies, was seized, and with\r\nthe threat of instant death at the stake, was commanded to conduct the\r\npapal emissary to the home of every Protestant in the city. He shrunk in\r\nhorror from the base proposal, but at last fear of the flames prevailed,\r\nand he consented to become the betrayer of his brethren. Preceded by the\r\nhost, and surrounded by a train of priests, incense-bearers, monks, and\r\nsoldiers, Morin, the royal detective, with the traitor, slowly and\r\nsilently passed through the streets of the city. The demonstration was\r\nostensibly in honor of the “holy sacrament,” an act of expiation for the\r\ninsult put upon the mass by the protesters. But beneath this pageant a\r\ndeadly purpose was concealed. On arriving opposite the house of a\r\nLutheran, the betrayer made a sign, but no word was uttered. The\r\nprocession halted, the house was entered, the family were dragged forth\r\nand chained, and the terrible company went forward in search of fresh\r\nvictims. They “spared no house, great or small, not even the colleges of\r\nthe University of Paris.... Morin made all the city quake.... It was a\r\nreign of terror.”(337)\r\n\r\nThe victims were put to death with cruel torture, it being specially\r\nordered that the fire should be lowered, in order to prolong their agony.\r\nBut they died as conquerors. Their constancy was unshaken, their peace\r\nunclouded. Their persecutors, powerless to move their inflexible firmness,\r\nfelt themselves defeated. “The scaffolds were distributed over all the\r\nquarters of Paris, and the burnings followed on successive days, the\r\ndesign being to spread the terror of heresy by spreading the executions.\r\nThe advantage, however, in the end, remained with the gospel. All Paris\r\nwas enabled to see what kind of men the new opinions could produce. There\r\nwas no pulpit like the martyr’s pile. The serene joy that lighted up the\r\nfaces of these men as they passed along ... to the place of execution,\r\ntheir heroism as they stood amid the bitter flames, their meek forgiveness\r\nof injuries, transformed, in instances not a few, anger into pity, and\r\nhate into love, and pleaded with resistless eloquence in behalf of the\r\ngospel.”(338)\r\n\r\nThe priests, bent upon keeping the popular fury at its height, circulated\r\nthe most terrible accusations against the Protestants. They were charged\r\nwith plotting to massacre the Catholics, to overthrow the government, and\r\nto murder the king. Not a shadow of evidence could be produced in support\r\nof the allegations. Yet these prophecies of evil were to have a\r\nfulfilment; under far different circumstances, however, and from causes of\r\nan opposite character. The cruelties that were inflicted upon the innocent\r\nProtestants by the Catholics, accumulated in a weight of retribution, and\r\nin after-centuries wrought the very doom they had predicted to be\r\nimpending, upon the king, his government, and his subjects; but it was\r\nbrought about by infidels, and by the papists themselves. It was not the\r\nestablishment, but the suppression, of Protestantism, that, three hundred\r\nyears later, was to bring upon France these dire calamities.\r\n\r\nSuspicion, distrust, and terror now pervaded all classes of society. Amid\r\nthe general alarm it was seen how deep a hold the Lutheran teaching had\r\ngained upon the minds of men who stood highest for education, influence,\r\nand excellence of character. Positions of trust and honor were suddenly\r\nfound vacant. Artisans, printers, scholars, professors in the\r\nuniversities, authors, and even courtiers, disappeared. Hundreds fled from\r\nParis, self-constituted exiles from their native land, in many cases thus\r\ngiving the first intimation that they favored the reformed faith. The\r\npapists looked about them in amazement at thought of the unsuspected\r\nheretics that had been tolerated among them. Their rage spent itself upon\r\nthe multitudes of humbler victims who were within their power. The prisons\r\nwere crowded, and the very air seemed darkened with the smoke of burning\r\npiles, kindled for the confessors of the gospel.\r\n\r\nFrancis I. had gloried in being a leader in the great movement for the\r\nrevival of learning which marked the opening of the sixteenth century. He\r\nhad delighted to gather at his court men of letters from every country. To\r\nhis love of learning and his contempt for the ignorance and superstition\r\nof the monks was due, in part at least, the degree of toleration that had\r\nbeen granted to the reform. But, inspired with zeal to stamp out heresy,\r\nthis patron of learning issued an edict declaring printing abolished all\r\nover France! Francis I. presents one among the many examples on record\r\nshowing that intellectual culture is not a safeguard against religious\r\nintolerance and persecution.\r\n\r\nFrance by a solemn and public ceremony was to commit herself fully to the\r\ndestruction of Protestantism. The priests demanded that the affront\r\noffered to high Heaven in the condemnation of the mass, be expiated in\r\nblood, and that the king, in behalf of his people, publicly give his\r\nsanction to the dreadful work.\r\n\r\nThe 21st of January, 1535, was fixed upon for the awful ceremonial. The\r\nsuperstitious fears and bigoted hatred of the whole nation had been\r\nroused. Paris was thronged with the multitudes that from all the\r\nsurrounding country crowded her streets. The day was to be ushered in by a\r\nvast and imposing procession. “The houses along the line of march were\r\nhung with mourning drapery, and altars rose at intervals.” Before every\r\ndoor was a lighted torch in honor of the “holy sacrament.” Before daybreak\r\nthe procession formed, at the palace of the king. “First came the banners\r\nand crosses of the several parishes; next appeared the citizens, walking\r\ntwo and two, and bearing torches.” The four orders of friars followed,\r\neach in its own peculiar dress. Then came a vast collection of famous\r\nrelics. Following these rode lordly ecclesiastics in their purple and\r\nscarlet robes and jeweled adornings, a gorgeous and glittering array.\r\n\r\n“The host was carried by the bishop of Paris under a magnificent canopy,\r\n... supported by four princes of the blood.... After the host walked the\r\nking.... Francis I. on that day wore no crown, nor robe of state.” With\r\n“head uncovered, his eyes cast on the ground, and in his hand a lighted\r\ntaper,” the king of France appeared “in the character of a penitent.”(339)\r\nAt every altar he bowed down in humiliation, not for the vices that\r\ndefiled his soul, nor the innocent blood that stained his hands, but for\r\nthe deadly sin of his subjects who had dared to condemn the mass.\r\nFollowing him came the queen and the dignitaries of state, also walking\r\ntwo and two, each with a lighted torch.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the services of the day, the monarch himself addressed the\r\nhigh officials of the kingdom in the great hall of the bishop’s palace.\r\nWith a sorrowful countenance he appeared before them, and in words of\r\nmoving eloquence bewailed “the crime, the blasphemy, the day of sorrow and\r\ndisgrace,” that had come upon the nation. And he called upon every loyal\r\nsubject to aid in the extirpation of the pestilent heresy that threatened\r\nFrance with ruin. “As true, Messieurs, as I am your king,” he said, “if I\r\nknew one of my own limbs spotted or infected with this detestable\r\nrottenness, I would give it you to cut off.... And further, if I saw one\r\nof my children defiled by it, I would not spare him.... I would deliver\r\nhim up myself, and would sacrifice him to God.” Tears choked his\r\nutterance, and the whole assembly wept, with one accord exclaiming, “We\r\nwill live and die for the Catholic religion!”(340)\r\n\r\nTerrible had become the darkness of the nation that had rejected the light\r\nof truth. “The grace that bringeth salvation” had appeared; but France,\r\nafter beholding its power and holiness, after thousands had been drawn by\r\nits divine beauty, after cities and hamlets had been illuminated by its\r\nradiance, had turned away, choosing darkness rather than light. They had\r\nput from them the heavenly gift, when it was offered them. They had called\r\nevil good, and good evil, till they had fallen victims to their wilful\r\nself-deception. Now, though they might actually believe that they were\r\ndoing God service in persecuting His people, yet their sincerity did not\r\nrender them guiltless. The light that would have saved them from\r\ndeception, from staining their souls with blood-guiltiness, they had\r\nwilfully rejected.\r\n\r\nA solemn oath to extirpate heresy was taken in the great cathedral where,\r\nnearly three centuries later, the “Goddess of Reason” was to be enthroned\r\nby a nation that had forgotten the living God. Again the procession\r\nformed, and the representatives of France set out to begin the work which\r\nthey had sworn to do. “At short distances scaffolds had been erected, on\r\nwhich certain Protestant Christians were to be burned alive, and it was\r\narranged that the fagots should be lighted at the moment the king\r\napproached, and that the procession should halt to witness the\r\nexecution.”(341) The details of the tortures endured by these witnesses\r\nfor Christ are too harrowing for recital; but there was no wavering on the\r\npart of the victims. On being urged to recant, one answered: “I only\r\nbelieve in what the prophets and the apostles formerly preached, and what\r\nall the company of saints believed. My faith has a confidence in God which\r\nwill resist all the powers of hell.”(342)\r\n\r\nAgain and again the procession halted at the places of torture. Upon\r\nreaching their starting-point at the royal palace, the crowd dispersed,\r\nand the king and the prelates withdrew, well satisfied with the day’s\r\nproceedings, and congratulating themselves that the work now begun would\r\nbe continued to the complete destruction of heresy.\r\n\r\nThe gospel of peace which France had rejected was to be only too surely\r\nrooted out, and terrible would be the results. On the 21st of January,\r\n1793, two hundred and fifty-eight years from the very day that fully\r\ncommitted France to the persecution of the Reformers, another procession,\r\nwith a far different purpose, passed through the streets of Paris. “Again\r\nthe king was the chief figure; again there were tumult and shouting; again\r\nthere was heard the cry for more victims; again there were black\r\nscaffolds; and again the scenes of the day were closed by horrid\r\nexecutions; Louis XVI., struggling hand to hand with his jailers and\r\nexecutioners, was dragged forward to the block, and there held down by\r\nmain force till the axe had fallen, and his dissevered head rolled on the\r\nscaffold.”(343) Nor was the king the only victim; near the same spot two\r\nthousand and eight hundred human beings perished by the guillotine during\r\nthe bloody days of the Reign of Terror.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation had presented to the world an open Bible, unsealing the\r\nprecepts of the law of God, and urging its claims upon the consciences of\r\nthe people. Infinite Love had unfolded to men the statutes and principles\r\nof heaven. God had said, “Keep therefore and do them; for this is your\r\nwisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall\r\nhear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and\r\nunderstanding people.”(344) When France rejected the gift of heaven, she\r\nsowed the seeds of anarchy and ruin; and the inevitable outworking of\r\ncause and effect resulted in the Revolution and the Reign of Terror.\r\n\r\nLong before the persecution excited by the placards, the bold and ardent\r\nFarel had been forced to flee from the land of his birth. He repaired to\r\nSwitzerland, and by his labors, seconding the work of Zwingle, he helped\r\nto turn the scale in favor of the Reformation. His later years were to be\r\nspent here, yet he continued to exert a decided influence upon the reform\r\nin France. During the first years of his exile, his efforts were\r\nespecially directed to spreading the gospel in his native country. He\r\nspent considerable time in preaching among his countrymen near the\r\nfrontier, where with tireless vigilance he watched the conflict, and aided\r\nby his words of encouragement and counsel. With the assistance of other\r\nexiles, the writings of the German Reformers were translated into the\r\nFrench language, and together with the French Bible, were printed in large\r\nquantities. By colporteurs, these works were sold extensively in France.\r\nThey were furnished to the colporteurs at a low price, and thus the\r\nprofits of the work enabled them to continue it.\r\n\r\nFarel entered upon his work in Switzerland in the humble guise of a\r\nschoolmaster. Repairing to a secluded parish, he devoted himself to the\r\ninstruction of children. Besides the usual branches of learning, he\r\ncautiously introduced the truths of the Bible, hoping through the children\r\nto reach their parents. There were some who believed, but the priests came\r\nforward to stop the work, and the superstitious country people were roused\r\nto oppose it. “That cannot be the gospel of Christ,” urged the priests,\r\n“seeing the preaching of it does not bring peace, but war.”(345) Like the\r\nfirst disciples, when persecuted in one city he fled to another. From\r\nvillage to village, from city to city, he went, traveling on foot,\r\nenduring hunger, cold, and weariness, and everywhere in peril of his life.\r\nHe preached in the market-places, in the churches, sometimes in the\r\npulpits of the cathedrals. Sometimes he found the church empty of hearers;\r\nat times his preaching was interrupted by shouts and jeers; again he was\r\npulled violently out of the pulpit. More than once he was set upon by the\r\nrabble, and beaten almost to death. Yet he pressed forward. Though often\r\nrepulsed, with unwearying persistence he returned to the attack; and one\r\nafter another, he saw towns and cities which had been strongholds of\r\npopery, opening their gates to the gospel. The little parish where he had\r\nfirst labored, soon accepted the reformed faith. The cities of Morat and\r\nNeuchâtel also renounced the Romish rites, and removed the idolatrous\r\nimages from their churches.\r\n\r\nFarel had long desired to plant the Protestant standard in Geneva. If this\r\ncity could be won, it would be a center for the Reformation in France, in\r\nSwitzerland, and in Italy. With this object before him, he had continued\r\nhis labors until many of the surrounding towns and hamlets had been\r\ngained. Then with a single companion he entered Geneva. But only two\r\nsermons was he permitted to preach. The priests, having vainly endeavored\r\nto secure his condemnation by the civil authorities, summoned him before\r\nan ecclesiastical council, to which they came with arms concealed under\r\ntheir robes, determined to take his life. Outside the hall, a furious mob,\r\nwith clubs and swords, was gathered to make sure of his death if he should\r\nsucceed in escaping the council. The presence of magistrates and an armed\r\nforce, however, saved him. Early next morning he was conducted, with his\r\ncompanion, across the lake to a place of safety. Thus ended his first\r\neffort to evangelize Geneva.\r\n\r\nFor the next trial a lowlier instrument was chosen,—a young man, so humble\r\nin appearance that he was coldly treated even by the professed friends of\r\nreform. But what could such a one do where Farel had been rejected? How\r\ncould one of little courage and experience withstand the tempest before\r\nwhich the strongest and bravest had been forced to flee? “Not by might,\r\nnor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord.”(346) “God hath chosen the\r\nweak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty.”\r\n“Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God\r\nis stronger than men.”(347)\r\n\r\nFroment began his work as a schoolmaster. The truths which he taught the\r\nchildren at school, they repeated at their homes. Soon the parents came to\r\nhear the Bible explained, until the schoolroom was filled with attentive\r\nlisteners. New Testaments and tracts were freely distributed, and they\r\nreached many who dared not come openly to listen to the new doctrines.\r\nAfter a time this laborer also was forced to flee; but the truths he\r\ntaught had taken hold upon the minds of the people. The Reformation had\r\nbeen planted, and it continued to strengthen and extend. The preachers\r\nreturned, and through their labors the Protestant worship was finally\r\nestablished in Geneva.\r\n\r\nThe city had already declared for the Reformation, when Calvin, after\r\nvarious wanderings and vicissitudes, entered its gates. Returning from a\r\nlast visit to his birthplace, he was on his way to Basel, when, finding\r\nthe direct road occupied by the armies of Charles V., he was forced to\r\ntake the circuitous route by Geneva.\r\n\r\nIn this visit, Farel recognized the hand of God. Though Geneva had\r\naccepted the reformed faith, yet a great work remained to be accomplished\r\nhere. It is not as communities but as individuals that men are converted\r\nto God; the work of regeneration must be wrought in the heart and\r\nconscience by the power of the Holy Spirit, not by the decrees of\r\ncouncils. While the people of Geneva had cast off the authority of Rome,\r\nthey were not so ready to renounce the vices that had flourished under her\r\nrule. To establish here the pure principles of the gospel, and to prepare\r\nthis people to fill worthily the position to which Providence seemed\r\ncalling them, was no light task.\r\n\r\nFarel was confident that he had found in Calvin one whom he could unite\r\nwith himself in this work. In the name of God he solemnly adjured the\r\nyoung evangelist to remain and labor here. Calvin drew back in alarm.\r\nTimid and peace-loving, he shrank from contact with the bold, independent,\r\nand even violent spirit of the Genevese. The feebleness of his health,\r\ntogether with his studious habits, led him to seek retirement. Believing\r\nthat by his pen he could best serve the cause of reform, he desired to\r\nfind a quiet retreat for study, and there, through the press, instruct and\r\nbuild up the churches. But Farel’s solemn admonition came to him as a call\r\nfrom heaven, and he dared not refuse. It seemed to him, he said, “that the\r\nhand of God was stretched down from heaven, that it lay hold of him, and\r\nfixed him irrevocably to the place he was so impatient to leave.”(348)\r\n\r\nAt this time great perils surrounded the Protestant cause. The anathemas\r\nof the pope thundered against Geneva, and mighty nations threatened it\r\nwith destruction. How was this little city to resist the powerful\r\nhierarchy that had so often forced kings and emperors to submission? How\r\ncould it stand against the armies of the world’s great conquerors?\r\n\r\nThroughout Christendom, Protestantism was menaced by formidable foes. The\r\nfirst triumphs of the Reformation past, Rome summoned new forces, hoping\r\nto accomplish its destruction. At this time, the order of the Jesuits was\r\ncreated, the most cruel, unscrupulous, and powerful of all the champions\r\nof popery. Cut off from earthly ties and human interests, dead to the\r\nclaims of natural affection, reason and conscience wholly silenced, they\r\nknew no rule, no tie, but that of their order, and no duty but to extend\r\nits power.(349) The gospel of Christ had enabled its adherents to meet\r\ndanger and endure suffering, undismayed by cold, hunger, toil, and\r\npoverty, to uphold the banner of truth in face of the rack, the dungeon,\r\nand the stake. To combat these forces, Jesuitism inspired its followers\r\nwith a fanaticism that enabled them to endure like dangers, and to oppose\r\nto the power of truth all the weapons of deception. There was no crime too\r\ngreat for them to commit, no deception too base for them to practise, no\r\ndisguise too difficult for them to assume. Vowed to perpetual poverty and\r\nhumility, it was their studied aim to secure wealth and power, to be\r\ndevoted to the overthrow of Protestantism, and the reestablishment of the\r\npapal supremacy.\r\n\r\nWhen appearing as members of their order, they wore a garb of sanctity,\r\nvisiting prisons and hospitals, ministering to the sick and the poor,\r\nprofessing to have renounced the world, and bearing the sacred name of\r\nJesus, who went about doing good. But under this blameless exterior the\r\nmost criminal and deadly purposes were often concealed. It was a\r\nfundamental principle of the order that the end justifies the means. By\r\nthis code, lying, theft, perjury, assassination, were not only pardonable\r\nbut commendable, when they served the interests of the church. Under\r\nvarious disguises the Jesuits worked their way into offices of state,\r\nclimbing up to be the counselors of kings, and shaping the policy of\r\nnations. They became servants, to act as spies upon their masters. They\r\nestablished colleges for the sons of princes and nobles, and schools for\r\nthe common people; and the children of Protestant parents were drawn into\r\nan observance of popish rites. All the outward pomp and display of the\r\nRomish worship was brought to bear to confuse the mind, and dazzle and\r\ncaptivate the imagination; and thus the liberty for which the fathers had\r\ntoiled and bled was betrayed by the sons. The Jesuits rapidly spread\r\nthemselves over Europe, and wherever they went, there followed a revival\r\nof popery.\r\n\r\nTo give them greater power, a bull was issued re-establishing the\r\nInquisition.(350) Notwithstanding the general abhorrence with which it was\r\nregarded, even in Catholic countries, this terrible tribunal was again set\r\nup by popish rulers, and atrocities too terrible to bear the light of day\r\nwere repeated in its secret dungeons. In many countries, thousands upon\r\nthousands of the very flower of the nation, the purest and noblest, the\r\nmost intellectual and highly educated, pious and devoted pastors,\r\nindustrious and patriotic citizens, brilliant scholars, talented artists,\r\nskilful artisans, were slain, or forced to flee to other lands.\r\n\r\nSuch were the means which Rome had invoked to quench the light of the\r\nReformation, to withdraw from men the Bible, and to restore the ignorance\r\nand superstition of the Dark Ages. But under God’s blessing and the labors\r\nof those noble men whom He had raised up to succeed Luther, Protestantism\r\nwas not overthrown. Not to the favor or arms of princes was it to owe its\r\nstrength. The smallest countries, the humblest and least powerful nations,\r\nbecame its strongholds. It was little Geneva in the midst of mighty foes\r\nplotting her destruction; it was Holland on her sand-banks by the northern\r\nsea, wrestling against the tyranny of Spain, then the greatest and most\r\nopulent of kingdoms; it was bleak, sterile Sweden, that gained victories\r\nfor the Reformation.\r\n\r\nFor nearly thirty years, Calvin labored at Geneva; first to establish\r\nthere a church adhering to the morality of the Bible, and then for the\r\nadvancement of the Reformation throughout Europe. His course as a public\r\nleader was not faultless, nor were his doctrines free from error. But he\r\nwas instrumental in promulgating truths that were of special importance in\r\nhis time, in maintaining the principles of Protestantism against the\r\nfast-returning tide of popery, and in promoting in the reformed churches\r\nsimplicity and purity of life, in place of the pride and corruption\r\nfostered under the Romish teaching.\r\n\r\nFrom Geneva, publications and teachers went out to spread the reformed\r\ndoctrines. To this point the persecuted of all lands looked for\r\ninstruction, counsel, and encouragement. The city of Calvin became a\r\nrefuge for the hunted Reformers of all Western Europe. Fleeing from the\r\nawful tempests that continued for centuries, the fugitives came to the\r\ngates of Geneva. Starving, wounded, bereft of home and kindred, they were\r\nwarmly welcomed and tenderly cared for; and finding a home here, they\r\nblessed the city of their adoption by their skill, their learning, and\r\ntheir piety. Many who sought here a refuge returned to their own countries\r\nto resist the tyranny of Rome. John Knox, the brave Scotch Reformer, not a\r\nfew of the English Puritans, the Protestants of Holland and of Spain, and\r\nthe Huguenots of France, carried from Geneva the torch of truth to lighten\r\nthe darkness of their native lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13. THE NETHERLANDS AND SCANDINAVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nIn the Netherlands the papal tyranny very early called forth resolute\r\nprotest. Seven hundred years before Luther’s time, the Roman pontiff was\r\nthus fearlessly impeached by two bishops, who, having been sent on an\r\nembassy to Rome, had learned the true character of the “holy see:” God\r\n“has made His queen and spouse, the church, a noble and everlasting\r\nprovision for her family, with a dowry that is neither fading nor\r\ncorruptible, and given her an eternal crown and scepter; ... all which\r\nbenefits you like a thief intercept. You set up yourself in the temple as\r\nGod; instead of pastor, you are become a wolf to the sheep; ... you would\r\nmake us believe you are a supreme bishop, but you rather behave like a\r\ntyrant.... Whereas you ought to be a servant of servants, as you call\r\nyourself, you endeavor to become a lord of lords.... You bring the\r\ncommands of God into contempt.... The Holy Ghost is the builder of all\r\nchurches as far as the earth extends.... The city of our God, of which we\r\nare the citizens, reaches to all the regions of the heavens; and it is\r\ngreater than the city, by the holy prophets named Babylon, which pretends\r\nto be divine, wins herself to heaven, and brags that her wisdom is\r\nimmortal; and finally, though without reason, that she never did err, nor\r\never can.”(351)\r\n\r\nOthers arose from century to century to echo this protest. And those early\r\nteachers, who, traversing different lands and known by various names, bore\r\nthe character of the Vaudois missionaries, and spread everywhere the\r\nknowledge of the gospel, penetrated to the Netherlands. Their doctrines\r\nspread rapidly. The Waldensian Bible they translated in verse into the\r\nDutch language. They declared “that there was great advantage in it; no\r\njests, no fables, no trifles, no deceits, but the words of truth; that\r\nindeed there was here and there a hard crust, but that the marrow and\r\nsweetness of what was good and holy might be easily discovered in\r\nit.”(352) Thus wrote the friends of the ancient faith, in the twelfth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nNow began the Romish persecutions; but in the midst of fagots and torture\r\nthe believers continued to multiply, steadfastly declaring that the Bible\r\nis the only infallible authority in religion, and that “no man should be\r\ncoerced to believe, but should be won by preaching.”(353)\r\n\r\nThe teachings of Luther found a congenial soil in the Netherlands, and\r\nearnest and faithful men arose to preach the gospel. From one of the\r\nprovinces of Holland came Menno Simons. Educated a Roman Catholic, and\r\nordained to the priesthood, he was wholly ignorant of the Bible, and he\r\nwould not read it, for fear of being beguiled into heresy. When a doubt\r\nconcerning the doctrine of transubstantiation forced itself upon him, he\r\nregarded it as a temptation from Satan, and by prayer and confession\r\nsought to free himself from it; but in vain. By mingling in scenes of\r\ndissipation he endeavored to silence the accusing voice of conscience; but\r\nwithout avail. After a time he was led to the study of the New Testament,\r\nand this, with Luther’s writings, caused him to accept the reformed faith.\r\nHe soon after witnessed in a neighboring village the beheading of a man\r\nwho was put to death for having been rebaptized. This led him to study the\r\nBible in regard to infant baptism. He could find no evidence for it in the\r\nScriptures, but saw that repentance and faith are everywhere required as\r\nthe condition of receiving baptism.\r\n\r\nMenno withdrew from the Roman Church, and devoted his life to teaching the\r\ntruths which he had received. In both Germany and the Netherlands a class\r\nof fanatics had risen, advocating absurd and seditious doctrines,\r\noutraging order and decency, and proceeding to violence and insurrection.\r\nMenno saw the horrible results to which these movements would inevitably\r\nlead, and he strenuously opposed the erroneous teachings and wild schemes\r\nof the fanatics. There were many, however, who had been misled by these\r\nfanatics, but who had renounced their pernicious doctrines; and there were\r\nstill remaining many descendants of the ancient Christians, the fruits of\r\nthe Waldensian teaching. Among these classes Menno labored with great zeal\r\nand success.\r\n\r\nFor twenty-five years he traveled, with his wife and children, enduring\r\ngreat hardships and privations, and frequently in peril of his life. He\r\ntraversed the Netherlands and northern Germany, laboring chiefly among the\r\nhumbler classes, but exerting a wide-spread influence. Naturally eloquent,\r\nthough possessing a limited education, he was a man of unwavering\r\nintegrity, of humble spirit and gentle manners, and of sincere and earnest\r\npiety, exemplifying in his own life the precepts which he taught, and he\r\ncommanded the confidence of the people. His followers were scattered and\r\noppressed. They suffered greatly from being confounded with the fanatical\r\nMunsterites. Yet great numbers were converted under his labors.\r\n\r\nNowhere were the reformed doctrines more generally received than in the\r\nNetherlands. In few countries did their adherents endure more terrible\r\npersecution. In Germany Charles V. had banned the Reformation, and he\r\nwould gladly have brought all its adherents to the stake; but the princes\r\nstood up as a barrier against his tyranny. In the Netherlands his power\r\nwas greater, and persecuting edicts followed each other in quick\r\nsuccession. To read the Bible, to hear or preach it, or even to speak\r\nconcerning it, was to incur the penalty of death by the stake. To pray to\r\nGod in secret, to refrain from bowing to an image, or to sing a psalm, was\r\nalso punishable with death. Even those who should abjure their errors,\r\nwere condemned, if men, to die by the sword; if women, to be buried alive.\r\nThousands perished under the reign of Charles and of Philip II.\r\n\r\nAt one time a whole family was brought before the inquisitors, charged\r\nwith remaining away from mass, and worshiping at home. On his examination\r\nas to their practices in secret, the youngest son answered, “We fall on\r\nour knees, and pray that God may enlighten our minds and pardon our sins;\r\nwe pray for our sovereign, that his reign may be prosperous and his life\r\nhappy; we pray for our magistrates, that God may preserve them.”(354) Some\r\nof the judges were deeply moved, yet the father and one of his sons were\r\ncondemned to the stake.\r\n\r\nThe rage of the persecutors was equaled by the faith of the martyrs. Not\r\nonly men but delicate women and young maidens displayed unflinching\r\ncourage. “Wives would take their stand by their husband’s stake, and while\r\nhe was enduring the fire they would whisper words of solace, or sing\r\npsalms to cheer him.” “Young maidens would lie down in their living grave\r\nas if they were entering into their chamber of nightly sleep; or go forth\r\nto the scaffold and the fire, dressed in their best apparel, as if they\r\nwere going to their marriage.”(355)\r\n\r\nAs in the days when paganism sought to destroy the gospel, the blood of\r\nthe Christians was seed.(356) Persecution served to increase the number of\r\nwitnesses for the truth. Year after year the monarch, stung to madness by\r\nthe unconquerable determination of the people, urged on his cruel work;\r\nbut in vain. Under the noble William of Orange, the Revolution at last\r\nbrought to Holland freedom to worship God.\r\n\r\nIn the mountains of Piedmont, on the plains of France and the shores of\r\nHolland, the progress of the gospel was marked with the blood of its\r\ndisciples. But in the countries of the North it found a peaceful entrance.\r\nStudents at Wittenberg, returning to their homes, carried the reformed\r\nfaith to Scandinavia. The publication of Luther’s writings also spread the\r\nlight. The simple, hardy people of the North turned from the corruption,\r\nthe pomp, and the superstitions of Rome, to welcome the purity, the\r\nsimplicity, and the life-giving truths of the Bible.\r\n\r\nTausen, “the Reformer of Denmark,” was a peasant’s son. The boy early gave\r\nevidence of vigorous intellect; he thirsted for an education; but this was\r\ndenied him by the circumstances of his parents, and he entered a cloister.\r\nHere the purity of his life, together with his diligence and fidelity, won\r\nthe favor of his superior. Examination showed him to possess talent that\r\npromised at some future day good service to the church. It was determined\r\nto give him an education at some one of the universities of Germany or the\r\nNetherlands. The young student was granted permission to choose a school\r\nfor himself, with one proviso, that he must not go to Wittenberg. The\r\nscholar of the church was not to be endangered by the poison of heresy. So\r\nsaid the friars.\r\n\r\nTausen went to Cologne, which was then, as now, one of the strongholds of\r\nRomanism. Here he soon became disgusted with the mysticisms of the\r\nschoolmen. About the same time he obtained Luther’s writings. He read them\r\nwith wonder and delight, and greatly desired to enjoy the personal\r\ninstruction of the Reformer. But to do so he must risk giving offense to\r\nhis monastic superior, and forfeiting his support. His decision was soon\r\nmade, and erelong he was enrolled as a student at Wittenberg.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Denmark, he again repaired to his cloister. No one as yet\r\nsuspected him of Lutheranism; he did not reveal his secret, but\r\nendeavored, without exciting the prejudices of his companions, to lead\r\nthem to a purer faith and a holier life. He opened the Bible, and\r\nexplained its true meaning, and at last preached Christ to them as the\r\nsinner’s righteousness and his only hope of salvation. Great was the wrath\r\nof the prior, who had built high hopes upon him as a valiant defender of\r\nRome. He was at once removed from his own monastery to another, and\r\nconfined to his cell, under strict supervision.\r\n\r\nTo the terror of his new guardians, several of the monks soon declared\r\nthemselves converts to Protestantism. Through the bars of his cell, Tausen\r\nhad communicated to his companions a knowledge of the truth. Had those\r\nDanish fathers been skilled in the church’s plan of dealing with heresy,\r\nTausen’s voice would never again have been heard; but instead of\r\nconsigning him to a tomb in some underground dungeon, they expelled him\r\nfrom the monastery. Now they were powerless. A royal edict, just issued,\r\noffered protection to the teachers of the new doctrine. Tausen began to\r\npreach. The churches were opened to him, and the people thronged to\r\nlisten. Others also were preaching the word of God. The New Testament,\r\ntranslated into the Danish tongue, was widely circulated. The efforts made\r\nby the papists to overthrow the work resulted in extending it, and erelong\r\nDenmark declared its acceptance of the reformed faith.\r\n\r\nIn Sweden, also, young men who had drunk from the well of Wittenberg\r\ncarried the water of life to their countrymen. Two of the leaders in the\r\nSwedish Reformation, Olaf and Laurentius Petri, the sons of a blacksmith\r\nof Orebro, studied under Luther and Melanchthon, and the truths which they\r\nthus learned they were diligent to teach. Like the great Reformer, Olaf\r\naroused the people by his zeal and eloquence, while Laurentius, like\r\nMelanchthon, was learned, thoughtful, and calm. Both were men of ardent\r\npiety, of high theological attainments, and of unflinching courage in\r\nadvancing the truth. Papist opposition was not lacking. The Catholic\r\npriests stirred up the ignorant and superstitious people. Olaf Petri was\r\noften assailed by the mob, and upon several occasions barely escaped with\r\nhis life. These reformers were, however, favored and protected by the\r\nking.\r\n\r\nUnder the rule of the Roman Church, the people were sunken in poverty, and\r\nground down by oppression. They were destitute of the Scriptures; and\r\nhaving a religion of mere signs and ceremonies, which conveyed no light to\r\nthe mind, they were returning to the superstitious beliefs and pagan\r\npractices of their heathen ancestors. The nation was divided into\r\ncontending factions, whose perpetual strife increased the misery of all.\r\nThe king determined upon a reformation in the state and the church, and he\r\nwelcomed these able assistants in the battle against Rome.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of the monarch and the leading men of Sweden, Olaf Petri\r\nwith great ability defended the doctrines of the reformed faith against\r\nthe Romish champions. He declared that the teachings of the Fathers are to\r\nbe received only when in accordance with the Scriptures; that the\r\nessential doctrines of the faith are presented in the Bible in a clear and\r\nsimple manner, so that all men may understand them. Christ said, “My\r\ndoctrine is not Mine, but His that sent Me;”(357) and Paul declared that\r\nshould he preach any other gospel than that which he had received, he\r\nwould be accursed.(358) “How, then,” said the Reformer, “shall others\r\npresume to enact dogmas at their pleasure, and impose them as things\r\nnecessary to salvation?”(359) He showed that the decrees of the church are\r\nof no authority when in opposition to the commands of God, and maintained\r\nthe great Protestant principle, that “the Bible and the Bible only,” is\r\nthe rule of faith and practice.\r\n\r\nThis contest, though conducted upon a stage comparatively obscure, serves\r\nto show us “the sort of men that formed the rank and file of the army of\r\nthe Reformers. They were not illiterate, sectarian, noisy\r\ncontroversialists—far from it; they were men who had studied the word of\r\nGod, and knew well how to wield the weapons with which the armory of the\r\nBible supplied them. In respect of erudition they were ahead of their age.\r\nWhen we confine our attention to such brilliant centers as Wittenberg and\r\nZurich, and to such illustrious names as those of Luther and Melanchthon,\r\nof Zwingle and Œcolampadius, we are apt to be told, these were the leaders\r\nof the movement, and we should naturally expect in them prodigious power\r\nand vast acquisitions; but the subordinates were not like these. Well, we\r\nturn to the obscure theater of Sweden, and the humble names of Olaf and\r\nLaurentius Petri—from the masters to the disciples—what do we find?...\r\nScholars and theologians; men who have thoroughly mastered the whole\r\nsystem of gospel truth, and who win an easy victory over the sophists of\r\nthe schools and the dignitaries of Rome.”(360)\r\n\r\nAs the result of this disputation, the king of Sweden accepted the\r\nProtestant faith, and not long afterward the national assembly declared in\r\nits favor. The New Testament had been translated by Olaf Petri into the\r\nSwedish language, and at the desire of the king the two brothers undertook\r\nthe translation of the whole Bible. Thus for the first time the people of\r\nSweden received the word of God in their native tongue. It was ordered by\r\nthe Diet that throughout the kingdom, ministers should explain the\r\nScriptures, and that the children in the schools should be taught to read\r\nthe Bible.\r\n\r\nSteadily and surely the darkness of ignorance and superstition was\r\ndispelled by the blessed light of the gospel. Freed from Romish\r\noppression, the nation attained to a strength and greatness it had never\r\nbefore reached. Sweden became one of the bulwarks of Protestantism. A\r\ncentury later, at a time of sorest peril, this small and hitherto feeble\r\nnation—the only one in Europe that dared lend a helping hand—came to the\r\ndeliverance of Germany in the terrible struggles of the Thirty Years’ War.\r\nAll Northern Europe seemed about to be brought again under the tyranny of\r\nRome. It was the armies of Sweden that enabled Germany to turn the tide of\r\npopish success, to win toleration for the Protestants,—Calvinists as well\r\nas Lutherans,—and to restore liberty of conscience to those countries that\r\nhad accepted the Reformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14. LATER ENGLISH REFORMERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nWhile Luther was opening a closed Bible to the people of Germany, Tyndale\r\nwas impelled by the Spirit of God to do the same for England. Wycliffe’s\r\nBible had been translated from the Latin text, which contained many\r\nerrors. It had never been printed, and the cost of manuscript copies was\r\nso great that few but wealthy men or nobles could procure it; and\r\nfurthermore, being strictly proscribed by the church, it had had a\r\ncomparatively narrow circulation. In 1516, a year before the appearance of\r\nLuther’s theses, Erasmus had published his Greek and Latin version of the\r\nNew Testament. Now for the first time the word of God was printed in the\r\noriginal tongue. In this work many errors of former versions were\r\ncorrected, and the sense was more clearly rendered. It led many among the\r\neducated classes to a better knowledge of the truth, and gave a new\r\nimpetus to the work of reform. But the common people were still, to a\r\ngreat extent, debarred from God’s word. Tyndale was to complete the work\r\nof Wycliffe in giving the Bible to his countrymen.\r\n\r\nA diligent student and an earnest seeker for truth, he had received the\r\ngospel from the Greek Testament of Erasmus. He fearlessly preached his\r\nconvictions, urging that all doctrines be tested by the Scriptures. To the\r\npapist claim that the church had given the Bible, and the church alone\r\ncould explain it, Tyndale responded: “Do you know who taught the eagles to\r\nfind their prey? Well, that same God teaches His hungry children to find\r\ntheir Father in His word. Far from having given us the Scriptures, it is\r\nyou who have hidden them from us; it is you who burn those who teach them,\r\nand if you could, you would burn the Scriptures themselves.”(361)\r\n\r\nTyndale’s preaching excited great interest; many accepted the truth. But\r\nthe priests were on the alert, and no sooner had he left the field than\r\nthey by their threats and misrepresentations endeavored to destroy his\r\nwork. Too often they succeeded. “What is to be done?” he exclaimed. “While\r\nI am sowing in one place, the enemy ravages the field I have just left. I\r\ncannot be everywhere. Oh! if Christians possessed the Holy Scriptures in\r\ntheir own tongue, they could of themselves withstand these sophists.\r\nWithout the Bible it is impossible to establish the laity in the\r\ntruth.”(362)\r\n\r\nA new purpose now took possession of his mind. “It was in the language of\r\nIsrael,” said he, “that the psalms were sung in the temple of Jehovah; and\r\nshall not the gospel speak the language of England among us?... Ought the\r\nchurch to have less light at noonday than at the dawn?... Christians must\r\nread the New Testament in their mother-tongue.” The doctors and teachers\r\nof the church disagreed among themselves. Only by the Bible could men\r\narrive at the truth. “One holdeth this doctor, another that.... Now each\r\nof these authors contradicts the other. How then can we distinguish him\r\nwho says right from him who says wrong?... How?... Verily by God’s\r\nword.”(363)\r\n\r\nIt was not long after that a learned Catholic doctor, engaging in\r\ncontroversy with him, exclaimed, “We were better to be without God’s laws\r\nthan the pope’s.” Tyndale replied, “I defy the pope and all his laws; and\r\nif God spare my life, ere many years I will cause a boy that driveth the\r\nplow to know more of the Scripture than you do.”(364)\r\n\r\nThe purpose which he had begun to cherish, of giving to the people the New\r\nTestament Scriptures in their own language, was now confirmed, and he\r\nimmediately applied himself to the work. Driven from his home by\r\npersecution, he went to London, and there for a time pursued his labors\r\nundisturbed. But again the violence of the papists forced him to flee. All\r\nEngland seemed closed against him, and he resolved to seek shelter in\r\nGermany. Here he began the printing of the English New Testament. Twice\r\nthe work was stopped; but when forbidden to print in one city, he went to\r\nanother. At last he made his way to Worms, where, a few years before,\r\nLuther had defended the gospel before the Diet. In that ancient city were\r\nmany friends of the Reformation, and Tyndale there prosecuted his work\r\nwithout further hindrance. Three thousand copies of the New Testament were\r\nsoon finished, and another edition followed in the same year.\r\n\r\nWith great earnestness and perseverance he continued his labors.\r\nNotwithstanding the English authorities had guarded their ports with the\r\nstrictest vigilance, the word of God was in various ways secretly conveyed\r\nto London, and thence circulated throughout the country. The papists\r\nattempted to suppress the truth, but in vain. The bishop of Durham at one\r\ntime bought of a bookseller who was a friend of Tyndale, his whole stock\r\nof Bibles, for the purpose of destroying them, supposing that this would\r\ngreatly hinder the work. But on the contrary, the money thus furnished,\r\npurchased material for a new and better edition, which, but for this,\r\ncould not have been published. When Tyndale was afterward made a prisoner,\r\nhis liberty was offered him on condition that he would reveal the names of\r\nthose who had helped him meet the expense of printing his Bibles. He\r\nreplied that the bishop of Durham had done more than any other person; for\r\nby paying a large price for the books left on hand, he had enabled him to\r\ngo on with good courage.\r\n\r\nTyndale was betrayed into the hands of his enemies, and at one time\r\nsuffered imprisonment for many months. He finally witnessed for his faith\r\nby a martyr’s death; but the weapons which he prepared have enabled other\r\nsoldiers to do battle through all the centuries even to our time.\r\n\r\nLatimer maintained from the pulpit that the Bible ought to be read in the\r\nlanguage of the people. The Author of Holy Scripture, said he, “is God\r\nHimself;” and this Scripture partakes of the might and eternity of its\r\nAuthor. “There is no king, emperor, magistrate, and ruler ... but are\r\nbound to obey ... His holy word.” “Let us not take any by-walks, but let\r\nGod’s word direct us: let us not walk after ... our forefathers, nor seek\r\nnot what they did, but what they should have done.”(365)\r\n\r\nBarnes and Frith, the faithful friends of Tyndale, arose to defend the\r\ntruth. The Ridleys and Cranmer followed. These leaders in the English\r\nReformation were men of learning, and most of them had been highly\r\nesteemed for zeal or piety in the Romish communion. Their opposition to\r\nthe papacy was the result of their knowledge of the errors of the “holy\r\nsee.” Their acquaintance with the mysteries of Babylon, gave greater power\r\nto their testimonies against her.\r\n\r\n“Now I would ask a strange question,” said Latimer. “Who is the most\r\ndiligent bishop and prelate in all England? ... I see you listening and\r\nhearkening that I should name him.... I will tell you: it is the devil....\r\nHe is never out of his diocese; ... call for him when you will, he is ever\r\nat home; ... he is ever at his plow.... Ye shall never find him idle, I\r\nwarrant you.... Where the devil is resident, ... there away with books,\r\nand up with candles; away with Bibles, and up with beads; away with the\r\nlight of the gospel, and up with the light of candles, yea, at noondays;\r\n... down with Christ’s cross, up with purgatory pick-purse; ... away with\r\nclothing the naked, the poor, and impotent, up with decking of images and\r\ngay garnishing of stocks and stones; up with man’s traditions and his\r\nlaws, down with God’s traditions and His most holy word.... O that our\r\nprelates would be as diligent to sow the corn of good doctrine, as Satan\r\nis to sow cockle and darnel!”(366)\r\n\r\nThe grand principle maintained by these Reformers—the same that had been\r\nheld by the Waldenses, by Wycliffe, by John Huss, by Luther, Zwingle, and\r\nthose who united with them—was the infallible authority of the Holy\r\nScriptures as a rule of faith and practice. They denied the right of\r\npopes, councils, Fathers, and kings, to control the conscience in matters\r\nof religion. The Bible was their authority, and by its teaching they\r\ntested all doctrines and all claims. Faith in God and His word sustained\r\nthese holy men as they yielded up their lives at the stake. “Be of good\r\ncomfort,” exclaimed Latimer to his fellow-martyr as the flames were about\r\nto silence their voices, “we shall this day light such a candle, by God’s\r\ngrace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out.”(367)\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the seeds of truth scattered by Columba and his co-laborers\r\nhad never been wholly destroyed. For hundreds of years after the churches\r\nof England submitted to Rome, those of Scotland maintained their freedom.\r\nIn the twelfth century, however, popery became established here, and in no\r\ncountry did it exercise a more absolute sway. Nowhere was the darkness\r\ndeeper. Still there came rays of light to pierce the gloom, and give\r\npromise of the coming day. The Lollards, coming from England with the\r\nBible and the teachings of Wycliffe, did much to preserve the knowledge of\r\nthe gospel, and every century had its witnesses and martyrs.\r\n\r\nWith the opening of the Great Reformation came the writings of Luther, and\r\nthen Tyndale’s English New Testament. Unnoticed by the hierarchy, these\r\nmessengers silently traversed the mountains and valleys, kindling into new\r\nlife the torch of truth so nearly extinguished in Scotland, and undoing\r\nthe work which Rome for four centuries of oppression had done.\r\n\r\nThen the blood of martyrs gave fresh impetus to the movement. The papist\r\nleaders, suddenly awakening to the danger that threatened their cause,\r\nbrought to the stake some of the noblest and most honored of the sons of\r\nScotland. They did but erect a pulpit, from which the words of these dying\r\nwitnesses were heard throughout the land, thrilling the souls of the\r\npeople with an undying purpose to cast off the shackles of Rome.\r\n\r\nHamilton and Wishart, princely in character as in birth, with a long line\r\nof humbler disciples, yielded up their lives at the stake. But from the\r\nburning pile of Wishart there came one whom the flames were not to\r\nsilence, one who under God was to strike the death-knell of popery in\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nJohn Knox had turned away from the traditions and mysticisms of the\r\nchurch, to feed upon the truths of God’s word; and the teaching of Wishart\r\nhad confirmed his determination to forsake the communion of Rome, and join\r\nhimself to the persecuted Reformers.\r\n\r\nUrged by his companions to take the office of preacher, he shrunk with\r\ntrembling from its responsibility, and it was only after days of seclusion\r\nand painful conflict with himself that he consented. But having once\r\naccepted the position, he pressed forward with inflexible determination\r\nand undaunted courage as long as life continued. This true-hearted\r\nReformer feared not the face of man. The fires of martyrdom, blazing\r\naround him, served only to quicken his zeal to greater intensity. With the\r\ntyrant’s axe held menacingly over his head, he stood his ground, striking\r\nsturdy blows on the right hand and on the left to demolish idolatry.\r\n\r\nWhen brought face to face with the queen of Scotland, in whose presence\r\nthe zeal of many a leader of the Protestants had abated, John Knox bore\r\nunswerving witness for the truth. He was not to be won by caresses; he\r\nquailed not before threats. The queen charged him with heresy. He had\r\ntaught the people to receive a religion prohibited by the state, she\r\ndeclared, and had thus transgressed God’s command enjoining subjects to\r\nobey their princes. Knox answered firmly:\r\n\r\n“As right religion took neither original strength nor authority from\r\nworldly princes, but from the eternal God alone, so are not subjects bound\r\nto frame their religion according to the appetites of their princes. For\r\noft it is that princes are the most ignorant of all others in God’s true\r\nreligion.... If all the seed of Abraham had been of the religion of\r\nPharaoh, whose subjects they long were, I pray you, madam, what religion\r\nwould there have been in the world? Or if all men in the days of the\r\napostles had been of the religion of the Roman emperors, what religion\r\nwould there have been upon the face of the earth?... And so, madam, ye may\r\nperceive that subjects are not bound to the religion of their princes,\r\nalbeit they are commanded to give them obedience.”\r\n\r\nSaid Mary, “Ye interpret the Scriptures in one manner, and they [the Roman\r\nCatholic teachers] interpret in another; whom shall I believe, and who\r\nshall be judge?”\r\n\r\n“Ye shall believe God, that plainly speaketh in His word,” answered the\r\nReformer; “and farther than the Word teaches you, ye neither shall believe\r\nthe one nor the other. The word of God is plain in itself; and if there\r\nappear any obscurity in one place, the Holy Ghost, which is never contrary\r\nto Himself, explains the same more clearly in other places, so that there\r\ncan remain no doubt but unto such as obstinately remain ignorant.”(368)\r\n\r\nSuch were the truths that the fearless Reformer, at the peril of his life,\r\nspoke in the ear of royalty. With the same undaunted courage he kept to\r\nhis purpose, praying and fighting the battles of the Lord, until Scotland\r\nwas free from popery.\r\n\r\nIn England the establishment of Protestantism as the national religion\r\ndiminished, but did not wholly stop, persecution. While many of the\r\ndoctrines of Rome had been renounced, not a few of its forms were\r\nretained. The supremacy of the pope was rejected, but in his place the\r\nmonarch was enthroned as the head of the church. In the service of the\r\nchurch there was still a wide departure from the purity and simplicity of\r\nthe gospel. The great principle of religious liberty was not as yet\r\nunderstood. Though the horrible cruelties which Rome employed against\r\nheresy were resorted to but rarely by Protestant rulers, yet the right of\r\nevery man to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience\r\nwas not acknowledged. All were required to accept the doctrines and\r\nobserve the forms of worship prescribed by the established church.\r\nDissenters suffered persecution, to a greater or less extent, for hundreds\r\nof years.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century thousands of pastors were expelled from their\r\npositions. The people were forbidden, on pain of heavy fines,\r\nimprisonment, and banishment, to attend any religious meetings except such\r\nas were sanctioned by the church. Those faithful souls who could not\r\nrefrain from gathering to worship God, were compelled to meet in dark\r\nalleys, in obscure garrets, and at some seasons in the woods at midnight.\r\nIn the sheltering depths of the forest, a temple of God’s own building,\r\nthose scattered and persecuted children of the Lord assembled to pour out\r\ntheir souls in prayer and praise. But despite all their precautions, many\r\nsuffered for their faith. The jails were crowded. Families were broken up.\r\nMany were banished to foreign lands. Yet God was with His people, and\r\npersecution could not prevail to silence their testimony. Many were driven\r\nacross the ocean to America, and here laid the foundations of civil and\r\nreligious liberty which have been the bulwark and glory of this country.\r\n\r\nAgain, as in apostolic days, persecution turned out to the furtherance of\r\nthe gospel. In a loathsome dungeon crowded with profligates and felons,\r\nJohn Bunyan breathed the very atmosphere of heaven; and there he wrote his\r\nwonderful allegory of the pilgrim’s journey from the land of destruction\r\nto the celestial city. For over two hundred years that voice from Bedford\r\njail has spoken with thrilling power to the hearts of men. Bunyan’s\r\n“Pilgrim’s Progress” and “Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners” have\r\nguided many feet into the path of life.\r\n\r\nBaxter, Flavel, Alleine, and other men of talent, education, and deep\r\nChristian experience, stood up in valiant defense of the faith which was\r\nonce delivered to the saints. The work accomplished by these men,\r\nproscribed and outlawed by the rulers of this world, can never perish.\r\nFlavel’s “Fountain of Life” and “Method of Grace” have taught thousands\r\nhow to commit the keeping of their souls to Christ. Baxter’s “Reformed\r\nPastor” has proved a blessing to many who desire a revival of the work of\r\nGod, and his “Saints’ Everlasting Rest” has done its work in leading souls\r\nto the “rest that remaineth for the people of God.”\r\n\r\nA hundred years later, in a day of great spiritual darkness, Whitefield\r\nand the Wesleys appeared as light-bearers for God. Under the rule of the\r\nestablished church, the people of England had lapsed into a state of\r\nreligious declension hardly to be distinguished from heathenism. Natural\r\nreligion was the favorite study of the clergy, and included most of their\r\ntheology. The higher classes sneered at piety, and prided themselves on\r\nbeing above what they called its fanaticism. The lower classes were\r\ngrossly ignorant, and abandoned to vice, while the church had no courage\r\nor faith any longer to support the downfallen cause of truth.\r\n\r\nThe great doctrine of justification by faith, so clearly taught by Luther,\r\nhad been almost wholly lost sight of; and the Romish principle of trusting\r\nto good works for salvation, had taken its place. Whitefield and the\r\nWesleys, who were members of the established church, were sincere seekers\r\nfor the favor of God, and this they had been taught was to be secured by a\r\nvirtuous life and an observance of the ordinances of religion.\r\n\r\nWhen Charles Wesley at one time fell ill, and anticipated that death was\r\napproaching, he was asked upon what he rested his hope of eternal life.\r\nHis answer was, “I have used my best endeavors to serve God.” As the\r\nfriend who had put the question seemed not to be fully satisfied with his\r\nanswer, Wesley thought, “What! are not my endeavors a sufficient ground of\r\nhope? Would he rob me of my endeavors? I have nothing else to trust\r\nto.”(369) Such was the dense darkness that had settled down on the church,\r\nhiding the atonement, robbing Christ of His glory, and turning the minds\r\nof men from their only hope of salvation,—the blood of the crucified\r\nRedeemer.\r\n\r\nWesley and his associates were led to see that true religion is seated in\r\nthe heart, and that God’s law extends to the thoughts as well as to the\r\nwords and actions. Convinced of the necessity of holiness of heart, as\r\nwell as correctness of outward deportment, they set out in earnest upon a\r\nnew life. By the most diligent and prayerful efforts they endeavored to\r\nsubdue the evils of the natural heart. They lived a life of self-denial,\r\ncharity, and humiliation, observing with great rigor and exactness every\r\nmeasure which they thought could be helpful to them in obtaining what they\r\nmost desired,—that holiness which could secure the favor of God. But they\r\ndid not obtain the object which they sought. In vain were their endeavors\r\nto free themselves from the condemnation of sin or to break its power. It\r\nwas the same struggle which Luther had experienced in his cell at Erfurt.\r\nIt was the same question which had tortured his soul,—“How should man be\r\njust before God?”(370)\r\n\r\nThe fires of divine truth, well-nigh extinguished upon the altars of\r\nProtestantism, were to be rekindled from the ancient torch handed down the\r\nages by the Bohemian Christians. After the Reformation, Protestantism in\r\nBohemia had been trampled out by the hordes of Rome. All who refused to\r\nrenounce the truth were forced to flee. Some of these, finding refuge in\r\nSaxony, there maintained the ancient faith. It was from the descendants of\r\nthese Christians that light came to Wesley and his associates.\r\n\r\nJohn and Charles Wesley, after being ordained to the ministry, were sent\r\non a mission to America. On board the ship was a company of Moravians.\r\nViolent storms were encountered on the passage, and John Wesley, brought\r\nface to face with death, felt that he had not the assurance of peace with\r\nGod. The Germans, on the contrary, manifested a calmness and trust to\r\nwhich he was a stranger.\r\n\r\n“I had long before,” he says, “observed the great seriousness of their\r\nbehavior. Of their humility they had given a continual proof, by\r\nperforming those servile offices for the other passengers which none of\r\nthe English would undertake; for which they desired and would receive no\r\npay, saying it was good for their proud hearts, and their loving Saviour\r\nhad done more for them. And every day had given them occasion of showing a\r\nmeekness which no injury could move. If they were pushed, struck, or\r\nthrown down, they rose again and went away; but no complaint was found in\r\ntheir mouth. There was now an opportunity of trying whether they were\r\ndelivered from the spirit of fear, as well as from that of pride, anger,\r\nand revenge. In the midst of the psalm wherewith their service began, the\r\nsea broke over, split the mainsail in pieces, covered the ship, and poured\r\nin between the decks as if the great deep had already swallowed us up. A\r\nterrible screaming began among the English. The Germans calmly sung on. I\r\nasked one of them afterward, ‘Were you not afraid?’ He answered, ‘I thank\r\nGod, no,’ I asked, ‘But were not your women and children afraid?’ He\r\nreplied mildly, ‘No; our women and children are not afraid to die.’ ”(371)\r\n\r\nUpon arriving in Savannah, Wesley for a short time abode with the\r\nMoravians, and was deeply impressed with their Christian deportment. Of\r\none of their religious services, in striking contrast to the lifeless\r\nformalism of the Church of England, he wrote: “The great simplicity as\r\nwell as solemnity of the whole almost made me forget the seventeen hundred\r\nyears between, and imagine myself in one of those assemblies where form\r\nand state were not; but Paul, the tent-maker, or Peter, the fisherman,\r\npresided; yet with the demonstration of the Spirit and of power.”(372)\r\n\r\nOn his return to England, Wesley, under the instruction of a Moravian\r\npreacher, arrived at a clearer understanding of Bible faith. He was\r\nconvinced that he must renounce all dependence upon his own works for\r\nsalvation, and must trust wholly to the “Lamb of God that taketh away the\r\nsin of the world.” At a meeting of the Moravian society in London, a\r\nstatement was read from Luther, describing the change which the Spirit of\r\nGod works in the heart of the believer. As Wesley listened, faith was\r\nkindled in his soul. “I felt my heart strangely warmed,” he says. “I felt\r\nI did trust in Christ, Christ alone, for salvation: and an assurance was\r\ngiven me, that He had taken away _my_ sins, even _mine_, and saved _me_\r\nfrom the law of sin and death.”(373)\r\n\r\nThrough long years of wearisome and comfortless striving,—years of\r\nrigorous self-denial, of reproach and humiliation,—Wesley had steadfastly\r\nadhered to his one purpose of seeking God. Now he had found Him; and he\r\nfound that the grace which he had toiled to win by prayers and fasts, by\r\nalmsdeeds and self-abnegation, was a gift, “without money, and without\r\nprice.”\r\n\r\nOnce established in the faith of Christ, his whole soul burned with the\r\ndesire to spread everywhere a knowledge of the glorious gospel of God’s\r\nfree grace. “I look upon all the world as my parish,” he said; “in\r\nwhatever part of it I am, I judge it meet, right, and my bounden duty, to\r\ndeclare unto all that are willing to hear, the glad tidings of\r\nsalvation.”(374)\r\n\r\nHe continued his strict and self-denying life, not now as the _ground_,\r\nbut the _result_ of faith; not the _root_, but the _fruit_ of holiness.\r\nThe grace of God in Christ is the foundation of the Christian’s hope, and\r\nthat grace will be manifested in obedience. Wesley’s life was devoted to\r\nthe preaching of the great truths which he had received,—justification\r\nthrough faith in the atoning blood of Christ, and the renewing power of\r\nthe Holy Spirit upon the heart, bringing forth fruit in a life conformed\r\nto the example of Christ.\r\n\r\nWhitefield and the Wesleys had been prepared for their work by long and\r\nsharp personal convictions of their own lost condition; and that they\r\nmight be able to endure hardness as good soldiers of Christ, they had been\r\nsubjected to the fiery ordeal of scorn, derision, and persecution, both in\r\nthe university and as they were entering the ministry. They and a few\r\nothers who sympathized with them were contemptuously called Methodists by\r\ntheir ungodly fellow-students,—a name which is at the present time\r\nregarded as honorable by one of the largest denominations in England and\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nAs members of the Church of England, they were strongly attached to her\r\nforms of worship, but the Lord had presented before them in His word a\r\nhigher standard. The Holy Spirit urged them to preach Christ and Him\r\ncrucified. The power of the Highest attended their labors. Thousands were\r\nconvicted and truly converted. It was necessary that these sheep be\r\nprotected from ravening wolves. Wesley had no thought of forming a new\r\ndenomination, but he organized them under what was called the Methodist\r\nConnection.\r\n\r\nMysterious and trying was the opposition which these preachers encountered\r\nfrom the established church; yet God, in His wisdom, had overruled events\r\nto cause the reform to begin within the church itself. Had it come wholly\r\nfrom without, it would not have penetrated where it was so much needed.\r\nBut as the revival preachers were churchmen, and labored within the pale\r\nof the church wherever they could find opportunity, the truth had an\r\nentrance where the doors would otherwise have remained closed. Some of the\r\nclergy were roused from their moral stupor, and became zealous preachers\r\nin their own parishes. Churches that had been petrified by formalism were\r\nquickened into life.\r\n\r\nIn Wesley’s time, as in all ages of the church’s history, men of different\r\ngifts performed their appointed work. They did not harmonize upon every\r\npoint of doctrine, but all were moved by the Spirit of God, and united in\r\nthe absorbing aim to win souls to Christ. The differences between\r\nWhitefield and the Wesleys threatened at one time to create alienation;\r\nbut as they learned meekness in the school of Christ, mutual forbearance\r\nand charity reconciled them. They had no time to dispute, while error and\r\niniquity were teeming everywhere, and sinners were going down to ruin.\r\n\r\nThe servants of God trod a rugged path. Men of influence and learning\r\nemployed their powers against them. After a time many of the clergy\r\nmanifested determined hostility, and the doors of the churches were closed\r\nagainst a pure faith and those who proclaimed it. The course of the clergy\r\nin denouncing them from the pulpit, aroused the elements of darkness,\r\nignorance, and iniquity. Again and again did John Wesley escape death by a\r\nmiracle of God’s mercy. When the rage of the mob was excited against him,\r\nand there seemed no way of escape, an angel in human form came to his\r\nside, the mob fell back, and the servant of Christ passed in safety from\r\nthe place of danger.\r\n\r\nOf his deliverance from the enraged mob on one of these occasions, Wesley\r\nsaid: “Many endeavored to throw me down while we were going down hill on a\r\nslippery path to the town; as well judging that if I was once on the\r\nground, I should hardly rise any more. But I made no stumble at all, nor\r\nthe least slip, till I was entirely out of their hands.... Although many\r\nstrove to lay hold on my collar or clothes, to pull me down, they could\r\nnot fasten at all: only one got fast hold of the flap of my waistcoat,\r\nwhich was soon left in his hand; the other flap, in the pocket of which\r\nwas a bank-note, was torn but half off.... A lusty man just behind, struck\r\nat me several times, with a large oaken stick; with which if he had struck\r\nme once on the back part of my head, it would have saved him all further\r\ntrouble. But every time the blow was turned aside, I know not how; for I\r\ncould not move to the right hand or left.... Another came rushing through\r\nthe press, and raising his arm to strike, on a sudden let it drop, and\r\nonly stroked my head, saying, ‘What soft hair he has!’ ... The very first\r\nmen whose hearts were turned were the heroes of the town, the captains of\r\nthe rabble on all occasions, one of them having been a prize-fighter at\r\nthe bear-gardens....\r\n\r\n“By how gentle degrees does God prepare us for His will! Two years ago, a\r\npiece of brick grazed my shoulders. It was a year after that the stone\r\nstruck me between the eyes. Last month I received one blow, and this\r\nevening two, one before we came into the town, and one after we were gone\r\nout; but both were as nothing: for though one man struck me on the breast\r\nwith all his might, and the other on the mouth with such a force that the\r\nblood gushed out immediately, I felt no more pain from either of the blows\r\nthan if they had touched me with a straw.”(375)\r\n\r\nThe Methodists of those early days—people as well as preachers—endured\r\nridicule and persecution, alike from church-members and from the openly\r\nirreligious who were inflamed by their misrepresentations. They were\r\narraigned before courts of justice—such only in name, for justice was rare\r\nin the courts of that time. Often they suffered violence from their\r\npersecutors. Mobs went from house to house, destroying furniture and\r\ngoods, plundering whatever they chose, and brutally abusing men, women,\r\nand children. In some instances, public notices were posted, calling upon\r\nthose who desired to assist in breaking the windows and robbing the houses\r\nof the Methodists, to assemble at a given time and place. These open\r\nviolations of both human and divine law were allowed to pass without a\r\nreprimand. A systematic persecution was carried on against a people whose\r\nonly fault was that of seeking to turn the feet of sinners from the path\r\nof destruction to the path of holiness.\r\n\r\nSaid John Wesley, referring to the charges against himself and his\r\nassociates: “Some allege that the doctrines of these men are false,\r\nerroneous, and enthusiastic; that they are new and unheard-of till of\r\nlate; that they are Quakerism, fanaticism, popery. This whole pretense has\r\nbeen already cut up by the roots, it having been shown at large that every\r\nbranch of this doctrine is the plain doctrine of Scripture interpreted by\r\nour own church. Therefore it cannot be either false or erroneous, provided\r\nthe Scripture be true.” “Others allege, ‘Their doctrine is too strict;\r\nthey make the way to heaven too narrow.’ And this is in truth the original\r\nobjection, (as it was almost the only one for some time,) and is secretly\r\nat the bottom of a thousand more, which appear in various forms. But do\r\nthey make the way to heaven any narrower than our Lord and His apostles\r\nmade it? Is their doctrine stricter than that of the Bible? Consider only\r\na few plain texts: ‘Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,\r\nand with all thy mind, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength.’\r\n‘For every idle word which men shall speak, they shall give an account in\r\nthe day of judgment.’ ‘Whether ye eat, or drink, or whatever ye do, do all\r\nto the glory of God.’\r\n\r\n“If their doctrine is stricter than this, they are to blame; but you know\r\nin your conscience it is not. And who can be one jot less strict without\r\ncorrupting the word of God? Can any steward of the mysteries of God be\r\nfound faithful if he change any part of that sacred depositum? No. He can\r\nabate nothing, he can soften nothing; he is constrained to declare to all\r\nmen, ‘I may not bring down the Scripture to your taste. You must come up\r\nto it, or perish forever.’ This is the real ground of that other popular\r\ncry concerning ‘the uncharitableness of these men.’ Uncharitable, are\r\nthey? In what respect? Do they not feed the hungry and clothe the naked?\r\n‘No; that is not the thing: they are not wanting in this: but they are so\r\nuncharitable in judging! they think none can be saved but those of their\r\nown way.’ ”(376)\r\n\r\nThe spiritual declension which had been manifest in England just before\r\nthe time of Wesley, was in great degree the result of Antinomian teaching.\r\nMany affirmed that Christ had abolished the moral law, and that Christians\r\nare therefore under no obligation to observe it; that a believer is freed\r\nfrom the “bondage of good works.” Others, though admitting the perpetuity\r\nof the law, declared that it was unnecessary for ministers to exhort the\r\npeople to obedience of its precepts, since those whom God had elected to\r\nsalvation would, “by the irresistible impulse of divine grace, be led to\r\nthe practice of piety and virtue,” while those who were doomed to eternal\r\nreprobation “did not have power to obey the divine law.”\r\n\r\nOthers, also holding that “the elect cannot fall from grace nor forfeit\r\nthe divine favor,” arrived at the still more hideous conclusion that “the\r\nwicked actions they commit are not really sinful, nor to be considered as\r\ninstances of their violation of the divine law, and that consequently they\r\nhave no occasion either to confess their sins or to break them off by\r\nrepentance.”(377) Therefore, they declared that even one of the vilest of\r\nsins, “considered universally an enormous violation of the divine law, is\r\nnot a sin in the sight of God,” if committed by one of the elect, “because\r\nit is one of the essential and distinctive characteristics of the elect,\r\nthat they cannot do anything that is either displeasing to God or\r\nprohibited by the law.”\r\n\r\nThese monstrous doctrines are essentially the same as the later teaching\r\nof popular educators and theologians,—that there is no unchangeable divine\r\nlaw as the standard of right, but that the standard of morality is\r\nindicated by society itself, and has constantly been subject to change.\r\nAll these ideas are inspired by the same master-spirit,—by him who, even\r\namong the sinless inhabitants of heaven, began his work of seeking to\r\nbreak down the righteous restraints of the law of God.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the divine decrees, unalterably fixing the character of\r\nmen, had led many to a virtual rejection of the law of God. Wesley\r\nsteadfastly opposed the errors of the Antinomian teachers, and showed that\r\nthis doctrine which led to Antinomianism was contrary to the Scriptures.\r\n“The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to _all men_.”\r\n“This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; who will\r\nhave _all men_ to be saved; and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.\r\nFor there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ\r\nJesus; who gave Himself a ransom for _all_.”(378) The Spirit of God is\r\nfreely bestowed, to enable every man to lay hold upon the means of\r\nsalvation. Thus Christ, “the true Light,” “lighteth every man that cometh\r\ninto the world.”(379) Men fail of salvation through their own wilful\r\nrefusal of the gift of life.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the claim that at the death of Christ the precepts of the\r\ndecalogue had been abolished with the ceremonial law, Wesley said: “The\r\nmoral law, contained in the ten commandments and enforced by the prophets,\r\nHe did not take away. It was not the design of His coming to revoke any\r\npart of this. This is a law which never can be broken, which ‘stands fast\r\nas the faithful witness in heaven.’ ... This was from the beginning of the\r\nworld, being ‘written not on tables of stone,’ but on the hearts of all\r\nthe children of men, when they came out of the hands of the Creator. And\r\nhowever the letters once wrote by the finger of God are now in a great\r\nmeasure defaced by sin, yet can they not wholly be blotted out, while we\r\nhave any consciousness of good and evil. Every part of this law must\r\nremain in force upon all mankind, and in all ages; as not depending either\r\non time or place, or any other circumstances liable to change, but on the\r\nnature of God, and the nature of man, and their unchangeable relation to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n“ ‘I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.’... Without question, His\r\nmeaning in this place is (consistently with all that goes before and\r\nfollows after),—I am come to establish it in its fulness, in spite of all\r\nthe glosses of men: I am come to place in a full and clear view whatsoever\r\nwas dark or obscure therein: I am come to declare the true and full import\r\nof every part of it; to show the length and breadth, the entire extent, of\r\nevery commandment contained therein, and the height and depth, the\r\ninconceivable purity and spirituality of it in all its branches.”(380)\r\n\r\nWesley declared the perfect harmony of the law and the gospel. “There is,\r\ntherefore, the closest connection that can be conceived, between the law\r\nand the gospel. On the one hand, the law continually makes way for, and\r\npoints us to, the gospel; on the other, the gospel continually leads us to\r\na more exact fulfilling of the law. The law, for instance, requires us to\r\nlove God, to love our neighbor, to be meek, humble, or holy. We feel that\r\nwe are not sufficient for these things; yea, that ‘with man this is\r\nimpossible:’ but we see a promise of God to give us that love, and to make\r\nus humble, meek, and holy: we lay hold of this gospel, of these glad\r\ntidings; it is done unto us according to our faith; and ‘the righteousness\r\nof the law is fulfilled in us,’ through faith which is in Christ Jesus....\r\n\r\n“In the highest rank of the enemies of the gospel of Christ,” said Wesley,\r\n“are they who openly and explicitly ‘judge the law’ itself, and ‘speak\r\nevil of the law;’ who teach men to break (to dissolve, to loose, to untie\r\nthe obligation of) not one only, whether of the least or of the greatest,\r\nbut all the commandments at a stroke.... The most surprising of all the\r\ncircumstances that attend this strong delusion, is that they who are given\r\nup to it, really believe that they honor Christ by overthrowing His law,\r\nand that they are magnifying His office while they are destroying His\r\ndoctrine! Yea, they honor Him just as Judas did when he said, ‘Hail,\r\nMaster, and kissed Him.’ And He may as justly say to every one of them,\r\n‘Betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?’ It is no other than betraying\r\nHim with a kiss, to talk of His blood, and take away His crown; to set\r\nlight by any part of His law, under pretense of advancing His gospel. Nor\r\nindeed can any one escape this charge, who preaches faith in any such a\r\nmanner as either directly or indirectly tends to set aside any branch of\r\nobedience: who preaches Christ so as to disannul, or weaken in any wise,\r\nthe least of the commandments of God.”(381)\r\n\r\nTo those who urged that “the preaching of the gospel answers all the ends\r\nof the law,” Wesley replied: “This we utterly deny. It does not answer the\r\nvery first end of the law, namely, the convincing men of sin, the\r\nawakening those who are still asleep on the brink of hell.” The apostle\r\nPaul declares that “by the law is the knowledge of sin;” “and not until\r\nman is convicted of sin, will he truly feel his need of the atoning blood\r\nof Christ.... ‘They that be whole,’ as our Lord Himself observes, ‘need\r\nnot a physician, but they that are sick.’ It is absurd, therefore, to\r\noffer a physician to them that are whole, or that at least imagine\r\nthemselves so to be. You are first to convince them that they are sick;\r\notherwise they will not thank you for your labor. It is equally absurd to\r\noffer Christ to them whose heart is whole, having never yet been\r\nbroken.”(382)\r\n\r\nThus while preaching the gospel of the grace of God, Wesley, like his\r\nMaster, sought to “magnify the law, and make it honorable.” Faithfully did\r\nhe accomplish the work given him of God, and glorious were the results\r\nwhich he was permitted to behold. At the close of his long life of more\r\nthan fourscore years—above half a century spent in itinerant ministry—his\r\navowed adherents numbered more than half a million souls. But the\r\nmultitude that through his labors had been lifted from the ruin and\r\ndegradation of sin to a higher and a purer life, and the number who by his\r\nteaching had attained to a deeper and richer experience, will never be\r\nknown till the whole family of the redeemed shall be gathered into the\r\nkingdom of God. His life presents a lesson of priceless worth to every\r\nChristian. Would that the faith and humility, the untiring zeal,\r\nself-sacrifice, and devotion of this servant of Christ, might be reflected\r\nin the churches of to-day!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15. THE BIBLE AND THE FRENCH REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century the Reformation, presenting an open Bible to the\r\npeople, had sought admission to all the countries of Europe. Some nations\r\nwelcomed it with gladness, as a messenger of Heaven. In other lands, the\r\npapacy succeeded to a great extent in preventing its entrance; and the\r\nlight of Bible knowledge, with its elevating influences, was almost wholly\r\nexcluded. In one country, though the light found entrance, it was not\r\ncomprehended by the darkness. For centuries, truth and error struggled for\r\nthe mastery. At last the evil triumphed, and the truth of Heaven was\r\nthrust out. “This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,\r\nand men loved darkness rather than light.”(383) The nation was left to\r\nreap the results of the course which she had chosen. The restraint of\r\nGod’s Spirit was removed from a people that had despised the gift of His\r\ngrace. Evil was permitted to come to maturity. And all the world saw the\r\nfruit of wilful rejection of the light.\r\n\r\nThe war against the Bible, carried forward for so many centuries in\r\nFrance, culminated in the scenes of the Revolution. That terrible\r\noutbreaking was but the legitimate result of Rome’s suppression of the\r\nScriptures.(384) It presented the most striking illustration which the\r\nworld has ever witnessed, of the working out of the papal policy,—an\r\nillustration of the results to which for more than a thousand years the\r\nteaching of the Roman Church had been tending.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of the Scriptures during the period of papal supremacy was\r\nforetold by the prophets; and the Revelator points also to the terrible\r\nresults that were to accrue especially to France from the domination of\r\n“the man of sin.”\r\n\r\nSaid the angel of the Lord: “The holy city shall they tread under foot\r\nforty and two months. And I will give power unto My two witnesses, and\r\nthey shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in\r\nsackcloth.... And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast\r\nthat ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and\r\nshall overcome them, and kill them. And their dead bodies shall lie in the\r\nstreet of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt,\r\nwhere also our Lord was crucified.... And they that dwell upon the earth\r\nshall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to\r\nanother; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the\r\nearth. And after three days and a half the Spirit of life from God entered\r\ninto them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them\r\nwhich saw them.”(385)\r\n\r\nThe periods here mentioned—“forty and two months,” and “a thousand two\r\nhundred and threescore days”—are the same, alike representing the time in\r\nwhich the church of Christ was to suffer oppression from Rome. The 1260\r\nyears of papal supremacy began in A.D. 538, and would therefore terminate\r\nin 1798.(386) At that time a French army entered Rome, and made the pope a\r\nprisoner, and he died in exile. Though a new pope was soon afterward\r\nelected, the papal hierarchy has never since been able to wield the power\r\nwhich it before possessed.\r\n\r\nThe persecution of the church did not continue throughout the entire\r\nperiod of the 1260 years. God in mercy to His people cut short the time of\r\ntheir fiery trial. In foretelling the “great tribulation” to befall the\r\nchurch, the Saviour said, “Except those days should be shortened, there\r\nshould no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be\r\nshortened.”(387) Through the influence of the Reformation, the persecution\r\nwas brought to an end prior to 1798.\r\n\r\nConcerning the two witnesses, the prophet declares further, “These are the\r\ntwo olive-trees, and the two candle-sticks standing before the God of the\r\nearth.” “Thy word,” said the psalmist, “is a lamp unto my feet, and a\r\nlight unto my path.”(388) The two witnesses represent the Scriptures of\r\nthe Old and the New Testament. Both are important testimonies to the\r\norigin and perpetuity of the law of God. Both are witnesses also to the\r\nplan of salvation. The types, sacrifices, and prophecies of the Old\r\nTestament point forward to a Saviour to come. The Gospels and Epistles of\r\nthe New Testament tell of a Saviour who has come in the exact manner\r\nforetold by type and prophecy.\r\n\r\n“They shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed\r\nin sackcloth.” During the greater part of this period, God’s witnesses\r\nremained in a state of obscurity. The papal power sought to hide from the\r\npeople the Word of truth, and set before them false witnesses to\r\ncontradict its testimony.(389) When the Bible was proscribed by religious\r\nand secular authority; when its testimony was perverted, and every effort\r\nmade that men and demons could invent to turn the minds of the people from\r\nit; when those who dared proclaim its sacred truths were hunted, betrayed,\r\ntortured, buried in dungeon cells, martyred for their faith, or compelled\r\nto flee to mountain fastnesses, and to dens and caves of the earth,—then\r\nthe faithful witnesses prophesied in sackcloth. Yet they continued their\r\ntestimony throughout the entire period of 1260 years. In the darkest times\r\nthere were faithful men who loved God’s word, and were jealous for His\r\nhonor. To these loyal servants were given wisdom, power, and authority to\r\ndeclare His truth during the whole of this time.\r\n\r\n“And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and\r\ndevoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this\r\nmanner be killed.”(390) Men cannot with impunity trample upon the word of\r\nGod. The meaning of this fearful denunciation is set forth in the closing\r\nchapter of the Revelation: “I testify unto every man that heareth the\r\nwords of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these\r\nthings, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:\r\nand if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this\r\nprophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of\r\nthe holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.”(391)\r\n\r\nSuch are the warnings which God has given to guard men against changing in\r\nany manner that which He has revealed or commanded. These solemn\r\ndenunciations apply to all who by their influence lead men to regard\r\nlightly the law of God. They should cause those to fear and tremble who\r\nflippantly declare it a matter of little consequence whether we obey God’s\r\nlaw or not. All who exalt their own opinions above divine revelation, all\r\nwho would change the plain meaning of Scripture to suit their own\r\nconvenience, or for the sake of conforming to the world, are taking upon\r\nthemselves a fearful responsibility. The written word, the law of God,\r\nwill measure the character of every man, and condemn all whom this\r\nunerring test shall declare wanting.\r\n\r\n“When they shall have finished [are finishing] their testimony.” The\r\nperiod when the two witnesses were to prophesy clothed in sackcloth, ended\r\nin 1798. As they were approaching the termination of their work in\r\nobscurity, war was to be made upon them by the power represented as “the\r\nbeast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit.” In many of the nations of\r\nEurope the powers that ruled in church and state had for centuries been\r\ncontrolled by Satan, through the medium of the papacy. But here is brought\r\nto view a new manifestation of satanic power.\r\n\r\nIt had been Rome’s policy, under a profession of reverence for the Bible,\r\nto keep it locked up in an unknown tongue, and hidden away from the\r\npeople. Under her rule the witnesses prophesied, “clothed in sackcloth.”\r\nBut another power—the beast from the bottomless pit—was to arise to make\r\nopen, avowed war upon the word of God.\r\n\r\nThe “great city” in whose streets the witnesses are slain, and where their\r\ndead bodies lie, “is spiritually Egypt.” Of all nations presented in Bible\r\nhistory, Egypt most boldly denied the existence of the living God, and\r\nresisted His commands. No monarch ever ventured upon more open and\r\nhigh-handed rebellion against the authority of Heaven than did the king of\r\nEgypt. When the message was brought him by Moses, in the name of the Lord,\r\nPharaoh proudly answered, “Who is Jehovah, that I should obey His voice to\r\nlet Israel go? I know not Jehovah, neither will I let Israel go.”(392)\r\nThis is atheism; and the nation represented by Egypt would give voice to a\r\nsimilar denial of the claims of the living God, and would manifest a like\r\nspirit of unbelief and defiance. The “great city” is also compared,\r\n“spiritually,” to Sodom. The corruption of Sodom in breaking the law of\r\nGod was especially manifested in licentiousness. And this sin was also to\r\nbe a pre-eminent characteristic of the nation that should fulfil the\r\nspecifications of this scripture.\r\n\r\nAccording to the words of the prophet, then, a little before the year 1798\r\nsome power of satanic origin and character would rise to make war upon the\r\nBible. And in the land where the testimony of God’s two witnesses should\r\nthus be silenced, there would be manifest the atheism of the Pharaoh and\r\nthe licentiousness of Sodom.\r\n\r\nThis prophecy has received a most exact and striking fulfilment in the\r\nhistory of France. During the Revolution, in 1793, “the world for the\r\nfirst time heard an assembly of men, born and educated in civilization,\r\nand assuming the right to govern one of the finest of the European\r\nnations, uplift their united voice to deny the most solemn truth which\r\nman’s soul receives, and renounce unanimously the belief and worship of a\r\nDeity.”(393) “France is the only nation in the world concerning which the\r\nauthentic record survives, that as a nation she lifted her hand in open\r\nrebellion against the Author of the universe. Plenty of blasphemers,\r\nplenty of infidels, there have been, and still continue to be, in England,\r\nGermany, Spain, and elsewhere; but France stands apart in the world’s\r\nhistory as the single state which, by the decree of her Legislative\r\nAssembly, pronounced that there was no God, and of which the entire\r\npopulation of the capital, and a vast majority elsewhere, women as well as\r\nmen, danced and sang with joy in accepting the announcement.”(394)\r\n\r\nFrance presented also the characteristic which especially distinguished\r\nSodom. During the Revolution there was manifest a state of moral\r\ndebasement and corruption similar to that which brought destruction upon\r\nthe cities of the plain. And the historian presents together the atheism\r\nand the licentiousness of France, as given in the prophecy: “Intimately\r\nconnected with these laws affecting religion, was that which reduced the\r\nunion of marriage—the most sacred engagement which human beings can form,\r\nand the permanence of which leads most strongly to the consolidation of\r\nsociety—to the state of a mere civil contract of a transitory character,\r\nwhich any two persons might engage in and cast loose at pleasure.... If\r\nfiends had set themselves to work to discover a mode of most effectually\r\ndestroying whatever is venerable, graceful, or permanent in domestic life,\r\nand of obtaining at the same time an assurance that the mischief which it\r\nwas their object to create should be perpetuated from one generation to\r\nanother, they could not have invented a more effectual plan than the\r\ndegradation of marriage.... Sophie Arnoult, an actress famous for the\r\nwitty things she said, described the republican marriage as ‘the sacrament\r\nof adultery.’ ”(395)\r\n\r\n“Where also our Lord was crucified.” This specification of the prophecy\r\nwas also fulfilled by France. In no land had the spirit of enmity against\r\nChrist been more strikingly displayed. In no country had the truth\r\nencountered more bitter and cruel opposition. In the persecution which\r\nFrance had visited upon the confessors of the gospel, she had crucified\r\nChrist in the person of His disciples.\r\n\r\nCentury after century the blood of the saints had been shed. While the\r\nWaldenses laid down their lives upon the mountains of Piedmont “for the\r\nword of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ,” similar witness to\r\nthe truth had been borne by their brethren, the Albigenses of France. In\r\nthe days of the Reformation, its disciples had been put to death with\r\nhorrible tortures. King and nobles, high-born women and delicate maidens,\r\nthe pride and chivalry of the nation, had feasted their eyes upon the\r\nagonies of the martyrs of Jesus. The brave Huguenots, battling for those\r\nrights which the human heart holds most sacred, had poured out their blood\r\non many a hard-fought field. The Protestants were counted as outlaws, a\r\nprice was set upon their heads, and they were hunted down like wild\r\nbeasts.\r\n\r\nThe “Church in the Desert,” the few descendants of the ancient Christians\r\nthat still lingered in France in the eighteenth century, hiding away in\r\nthe mountains of the south, still cherished the faith of their fathers. As\r\nthey ventured to meet by night on mountainside or lonely moor, they were\r\nchased by dragoons, and dragged away to life-long slavery in the galleys.\r\nThe purest, the most refined, and the most intelligent of the French, were\r\nchained, in horrible torture, amidst robbers and assassins.(396) Others,\r\nmore mercifully dealt with, were shot down in cold blood, as, unarmed and\r\nhelpless, they fell upon their knees in prayer. Hundreds of aged men,\r\ndefenseless women, and innocent children were left dead upon the earth at\r\ntheir place of meeting. In traversing the mountainside or the forest,\r\nwhere they had been accustomed to assemble, it was not unusual to find “at\r\nevery four paces, dead bodies dotting the sward, and corpses hanging\r\nsuspended from the trees.” Their country, laid waste with the sword, the\r\naxe, the fagot, “was converted into one vast, gloomy wilderness.” “These\r\natrocities were enacted ... in no dark age, but in the brilliant era of\r\nLouis XIV. Science was then cultivated, letters flourished, the divines of\r\nthe court and of the capital were learned and eloquent men, and greatly\r\naffected the graces of meekness and charity.”(397)\r\n\r\nBut blackest in the black catalogue of crime, most horrible among the\r\nfiendish deeds of all the dreadful centuries, was the St. Bartholomew\r\nMassacre. The world still recalls with shuddering horror the scenes of\r\nthat most cowardly and cruel onslaught. The king of France, urged on by\r\nRomish priests and prelates, lent his sanction to the dreadful work. A\r\nbell, tolling at dead of night, was a signal for the slaughter.\r\nProtestants by thousands, sleeping quietly in their homes, trusting to the\r\nplighted honor of their king, were dragged forth without a warning, and\r\nmurdered in cold blood.\r\n\r\nAs Christ was the invisible leader of His people from Egyptian bondage, so\r\nwas Satan the unseen leader of his subjects in this horrible work of\r\nmultiplying martyrs. For seven days the massacre was continued in Paris,\r\nthe first three with inconceivable fury. And it was not confined to the\r\ncity itself, but by special order of the king, was extended to all the\r\nprovinces and towns where Protestants were found. Neither age nor sex was\r\nrespected. Neither the innocent babe nor the man of gray hairs was spared.\r\nNoble and peasant, old and young, mother and child, were cut down\r\ntogether. Throughout France the butchery continued for two months. Seventy\r\nthousand of the very flower of the nation perished.\r\n\r\n“When the news of the massacre reached Rome, the exultation among the\r\nclergy knew no bounds. The cardinal of Lorraine rewarded the messenger\r\nwith a thousand crowns; the cannon of St. Angelo thundered forth a joyous\r\nsalute; the bells rang out from every steeple; bonfires turned night into\r\nday; and Gregory XIII., attended by the cardinals and other ecclesiastical\r\ndignitaries, went in long procession to the church of St. Louis, where the\r\ncardinal of Lorraine chanted a _Te Deum_.... A medal was struck to\r\ncommemorate the massacre, and in the Vatican may still be seen three\r\nfrescoes of Vasari, describing the attack upon the admiral, the king in\r\ncouncil plotting the massacre, and the massacre itself. Gregory sent\r\nCharles the Golden Rose; and four months after the massacre, ... he\r\nlistened complacently to the sermon of a French priest, ... who spoke of\r\n‘that day so full of happiness and joy, when the most holy father received\r\nthe news, and went in solemn state to render thanks to God and St.\r\nLouis.’ ”(398)\r\n\r\nThe same master-spirit that urged on the St. Bartholomew Massacre led also\r\nin the scenes of the Revolution. Jesus Christ was declared to be an\r\nimpostor, and the rallying cry of the French infidels was, “Crush the\r\nWretch,” meaning Christ. Heaven-daring blasphemy and abominable wickedness\r\nwent hand in hand, and the basest of men, the most abandoned monsters of\r\ncruelty and vice, were most highly exalted. In all this, supreme homage\r\nwas paid to Satan; while Christ, in His characteristics of truth, purity,\r\nand unselfish love, was crucified.\r\n\r\n“The beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against\r\nthem, and shall overcome them, and kill them.” The atheistical power that\r\nruled in France during the Revolution and the Reign of Terror, did wage\r\nsuch a war against God and His holy word as the world had never witnessed.\r\nThe worship of the Deity was abolished by the National Assembly. Bibles\r\nwere collected and publicly burned with every possible manifestation of\r\nscorn.\r\n\r\nThe law of God was trampled under foot. The institutions of the Bible were\r\nabolished. The weekly rest-day was set aside, and in its stead every tenth\r\nday was devoted to reveling and blasphemy. Baptism and the communion were\r\nprohibited. And announcements posted conspicuously over the burial-places\r\ndeclared death to be an eternal sleep.\r\n\r\nThe fear of God was said to be so far from the beginning of wisdom that it\r\nwas the beginning of folly. All religious worship was prohibited, except\r\nthat of liberty and the country. The “constitutional bishop of Paris was\r\nbrought forward to play the principal part in the most impudent and\r\nscandalous farce ever acted in the face of a national representation....\r\nHe was brought forward in full procession, to declare to the Convention\r\nthat the religion which he had taught so many years was, in every respect,\r\na piece of priestcraft, which had no foundation either in history or\r\nsacred truth. He disowned, in solemn and explicit terms, the existence of\r\nthe Deity to whose worship he had been consecrated, and devoted himself in\r\nfuture to the homage of liberty, equality, virtue, and morality. He then\r\nlaid on the table his episcopal decorations, and received a fraternal\r\nembrace from the president of the Convention. Several apostate priests\r\nfollowed the example of this prelate.”(399)\r\n\r\n“And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make\r\nmerry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets\r\ntormented them that dwelt on the earth.” Infidel France had silenced the\r\nreproving voice of God’s two witnesses. The Word of truth lay dead in her\r\nstreets, and those who hated the restrictions and requirements of God’s\r\nlaw were jubilant. Men publicly defied the King of heaven. Like the\r\nsinners of old, they cried, “How doth God know? and is there knowledge in\r\nthe Most High?”(400)\r\n\r\nWith blasphemous boldness almost beyond belief, one of the priests of the\r\nnew order said: “God, if You exist, avenge Your injured name. I bid You\r\ndefiance! You remain silent; You dare not launch Your thunders. Who after\r\nthis will believe in Your existence?”(401) What an echo is this of the\r\nPharaoh’s demand: “Who is Jehovah, that I should obey His voice?” “I know\r\nnot Jehovah!”\r\n\r\n“The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.”(402) And the Lord\r\ndeclares concerning the perverters of the truth, “Their folly shall be\r\nmanifest unto all.”(403) After France had renounced the worship of the\r\nliving God, “the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity,” it was only\r\na little time till she descended to degrading idolatry, by the worship of\r\nthe Goddess of Reason, in the person of a profligate woman. And this in\r\nthe representative assembly of the nation, and by its highest civil and\r\nlegislative authorities! Says the historian: “One of the ceremonies of\r\nthis insane time stands unrivaled for absurdity combined with impiety. The\r\ndoors of the Convention were thrown open to a band of musicians, preceded\r\nby whom, the members of the municipal body entered in solemn procession,\r\nsinging a hymn in praise of liberty, and escorting, as the object of their\r\nfuture worship, a veiled female, whom they termed the Goddess of Reason.\r\nBeing brought within the bar, she was unveiled with great form, and placed\r\non the right of the president, when she was generally recognized as a\r\ndancing girl of the opera.... To this person, as the fittest\r\nrepresentative of that reason whom they worshiped, the National Convention\r\nof France rendered public homage.\r\n\r\n“This impious and ridiculous mummery had a certain fashion; and the\r\ninstallation of the Goddess of Reason was renewed and imitated throughout\r\nthe nation, in such places where the inhabitants desired to show\r\nthemselves equal to all the heights of the Revolution.”(404)\r\n\r\nSaid the orator who introduced the worship of Reason: “Legislators!\r\nFanaticism has given way to reason. Its bleared eyes could not endure the\r\nbrilliancy of the light. This day an immense concourse has assembled\r\nbeneath those gothic vaults, which, for the first time, re-echoed the\r\ntruth. There the French have celebrated the only true worship,—that of\r\nLiberty, that of Reason. There we have formed wishes for the prosperity of\r\nthe arms of the Republic. There we have abandoned inanimate idols for\r\nReason, for that animated image, the masterpiece of nature.”(405)\r\n\r\nWhen the goddess was brought into the Convention, the orator took her by\r\nthe hand, and turning to the assembly said: “Mortals, cease to tremble\r\nbefore the powerless thunders of a God whom your fears have created.\r\nHenceforth acknowledge no divinity but Reason. I offer you its noblest and\r\npurest image; if you must have idols, sacrifice only to such as this....\r\nFall before the august Senate of Freedom, oh! Veil of Reason!...\r\n\r\n“The goddess, after being embraced by the president, was mounted on a\r\nmagnificent car, and conducted, amid an immense crowd, to the cathedral of\r\nNotre Dame, to take the place of the Deity. There she was elevated on the\r\nhigh altar, and received the adoration of all present.”(406)\r\n\r\nThis was followed, not long afterward, by the public burning of the Bible.\r\nOn one occasion “the Popular Society of the Museum” entered the hall of\r\nthe municipality, exclaiming, “_Vive la Raison!_” and carrying on the top\r\nof a pole the half-burned remains of several books, among others\r\nbreviaries, missals, and the Old and New Testaments, which “expiated in a\r\ngreat fire,” said the president, “all the fooleries which they have made\r\nthe human race commit.”(407)\r\n\r\nIt was popery that had begun the work which atheism was completing. The\r\npolicy of Rome had wrought out those conditions, social, political, and\r\nreligious, that were hurrying France on to ruin. Writers, in referring to\r\nthe horrors of the Revolution, say that these excesses are to be charged\r\nupon the throne and the church.(408) In strict justice they are to be\r\ncharged upon the church. Popery had poisoned the minds of kings against\r\nthe Reformation, as an enemy to the crown, an element of discord that\r\nwould be fatal to the peace and harmony of the nation. It was the genius\r\nof Rome that by this means inspired the direst cruelty and the most\r\ngalling oppression which proceeded from the throne.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of liberty went with the Bible. Wherever the gospel was\r\nreceived, the minds of the people were awakened. They began to cast off\r\nthe shackles that had held them bond-slaves of ignorance, vice, and\r\nsuperstition. They began to think and act as men. Monarchs saw it, and\r\ntrembled for their despotism.\r\n\r\nRome was not slow to inflame their jealous fears. Said the pope to the\r\nregent of France in 1525: “This mania [Protestantism] will not only\r\nconfound and destroy religion, but all principalities, nobility, laws,\r\norders, and ranks besides.”(409) A few years later a papal nuncio warned\r\nthe king: “Sire, be not deceived. The Protestants will upset all civil as\r\nwell as religious order.... The throne is in as much danger as the\r\naltar.... The introduction of a new religion must necessarily introduce a\r\nnew government.”(410) And theologians appealed to the prejudices of the\r\npeople by declaring that the Protestant doctrine “entices men away to\r\nnovelties and folly; it robs the king of the devoted affection of his\r\nsubjects, and devastates both church and state.” Thus Rome succeeded in\r\narraying France against the Reformation. “It was to uphold the throne,\r\npreserve the nobles, and maintain the laws, that the sword of persecution\r\nwas first unsheathed in France.”(411)\r\n\r\nLittle did the rulers of the land foresee the results of that fateful\r\npolicy. The teaching of the Bible would have implanted in the minds and\r\nhearts of the people those principles of justice, temperance, truth,\r\nequity, and benevolence which are the very corner-stone of a nation’s\r\nprosperity. “Righteousness exalteth a nation.” Thereby “the throne is\r\nestablished.”(412) “The work of righteousness shall be peace;” and the\r\neffect “quietness and assurance forever.”(413) He who obeys the divine law\r\nwill most truly respect and obey the laws of his country. He who fears God\r\nwill honor the king in the exercise of all just and legitimate authority.\r\nBut unhappy France prohibited the Bible, and banned its disciples. Century\r\nafter century, men of principle and integrity, men of intellectual\r\nacuteness and moral strength, who had the courage to avow their\r\nconvictions, and the faith to suffer for the truth,—for centuries these\r\nmen toiled as slaves in the galleys, perished at the stake, or rotted in\r\ndungeon cells. Thousands upon thousands found safety in flight; and this\r\ncontinued for two hundred and fifty years after the opening of the\r\nReformation.\r\n\r\n“Scarcely was there a generation of Frenchmen during that long period that\r\ndid not witness the disciples of the gospel fleeing before the insane fury\r\nof the persecutor, and carrying with them the intelligence, the arts, the\r\nindustry, the order, in which, as a rule, they pre-eminently excelled, to\r\nenrich the lands in which they found an asylum. And in proportion as they\r\nreplenished other countries with these good gifts, did they empty their\r\nown of them. If all that was now driven away had been retained in France;\r\nif, during these three hundred years, the industrial skill of the exiles\r\nhad been cultivating her soil; if, during these three hundred years, their\r\nartistic bent had been improving her manufactures; if, during these three\r\nhundred years, their creative genius and analytic power had been enriching\r\nher literature and cultivating her science; if their wisdom had been\r\nguiding her councils, their bravery fighting her battles, their equity\r\nframing her laws, and the religion of the Bible strengthening the\r\nintellect and governing the conscience of her people, what a glory would\r\nat this day have encompassed France! What a great, prosperous, and happy\r\ncountry—a pattern to the nations—would she have been!\r\n\r\n“But a blind and inexorable bigotry chased from her soil every teacher of\r\nvirtue, every champion of order, every honest defender of the throne; it\r\nsaid to the men who would have made their country a ‘renown and glory’ in\r\nthe earth, Choose which you will have, a stake or exile. At last the ruin\r\nof the state was complete; there remained no more conscience to be\r\nproscribed; no more religion to be dragged to the stake; no more\r\npatriotism to be chased into banishment.”(414) And the Revolution, with\r\nall its horrors, was the dire result.\r\n\r\n“With the flight of the Huguenots a general decline settled upon France.\r\nFlourishing manufacturing cities fell into decay; fertile districts\r\nreturned to their native wildness; intellectual dulness and moral\r\ndeclension succeeded a period of unwonted progress. Paris became one vast\r\nalmshouse, and it is estimated that, at the breaking out of the\r\nRevolution, two hundred thousand paupers claimed charity from the hands of\r\nthe king. The Jesuits alone flourished in the decaying nation, and ruled\r\nwith dreadful tyranny over churches and schools, the prisons and the\r\ngalleys.”\r\n\r\nThe gospel would have brought to France the solution of those political\r\nand social problems that baffled the skill of her clergy, her king, and\r\nher legislators, and finally plunged the nation into anarchy and ruin. But\r\nunder the domination of Rome the people had lost the Saviour’s blessed\r\nlessons of self-sacrifice and unselfish love. They had been led away from\r\nthe practice of self-denial for the good of others. The rich had found no\r\nrebuke for their oppression of the poor, the poor no help for their\r\nservitude and degradation. The selfishness of the wealthy and powerful\r\ngrew more and more apparent and oppressive. For centuries the greed and\r\nprofligacy of the noble resulted in grinding extortion toward the peasant.\r\nThe rich wronged the poor, and the poor hated the rich.\r\n\r\nIn many provinces the estates were held by the nobles, and the laboring\r\nclasses were only tenants; they were at the mercy of their landlords, and\r\nwere forced to submit to their exorbitant demands. The burden of\r\nsupporting both the church and the state fell upon the middle and lower\r\nclasses, who were heavily taxed by the civil authorities and by the\r\nclergy. “The pleasure of the nobles was considered the supreme law; the\r\nfarmers and the peasants might starve, for aught their oppressors\r\ncared.... The people were compelled at every turn to consult the exclusive\r\ninterest of the landlord. The lives of the agricultural laborers were\r\nlives of incessant work and unrelieved misery; their complaints, if they\r\never dared to complain, were treated with insolent contempt. The courts of\r\njustice would always listen to a noble as against a peasant; bribes were\r\nnotoriously accepted by the judges; and the merest caprice of the\r\naristocracy had the force of law, by virtue of this system of universal\r\ncorruption. Of the taxes wrung from the commonalty, by the secular\r\nmagnates on the one hand, and the clergy on the other, not half ever found\r\nits way into the royal or episcopal treasury; the rest was squandered in\r\nprofligate self-indulgence. And the men who thus impoverished their\r\nfellow-subjects were themselves exempt from taxation, and entitled by law\r\nor custom to all the appointments of the state. The privileged classes\r\nnumbered a hundred and fifty thousand, and for their gratification\r\nmillions were condemned to hopeless and degrading lives.”(415)\r\n\r\nThe court was given up to luxury and profligacy. There was little\r\nconfidence existing between the people and the rulers. Suspicion fastened\r\nupon all the measures of the government, as designing and selfish. For\r\nmore than half a century before the time of the Revolution, the throne was\r\noccupied by Louis XV., who, even in those evil times, was distinguished as\r\nan indolent, frivolous, and sensual monarch. With a depraved and cruel\r\naristocracy and an impoverished and ignorant lower class, the state\r\nfinancially embarrassed, and the people exasperated, it needed no\r\nprophet’s eye to foresee a terrible impending outbreak. To the warnings of\r\nhis counselors the king was accustomed to reply, “Try to make things go on\r\nas long as I am likely to live; after my death it may be as it will.” It\r\nwas in vain that the necessity of reform was urged. He saw the evils, but\r\nhad neither the courage nor the power to meet them. The doom awaiting\r\nFrance was but too truly pictured in his indolent and selfish\r\nanswer,—“After me, the deluge!”\r\n\r\nBy working upon the jealousy of the kings and the ruling classes, Rome had\r\ninfluenced them to keep the people in bondage, well knowing that the state\r\nwould thus be weakened, and purposing by this means to fasten both rulers\r\nand people in her thrall. With far-sighted policy she perceived that in\r\norder to enslave men effectually, the shackles must be bound upon their\r\nsouls; that the surest way to prevent them from escaping their bondage was\r\nto render them incapable of freedom. A thousandfold more terrible than the\r\nphysical suffering which resulted from her policy, was the moral\r\ndegradation. Deprived of the Bible, and abandoned to the teachings of\r\nbigotry and selfishness, the people were shrouded in ignorance and\r\nsuperstition, and sunken in vice, so that they were wholly unfitted for\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nBut the outworking of all this was widely different from what Rome had\r\npurposed. Instead of holding the masses in a blind submission to her\r\ndogmas, her work resulted in making them infidels and revolutionists.\r\nRomanism they despised as priestcraft. They beheld the clergy as a party\r\nto their oppression. The only god they knew was the god of Rome; her\r\nteaching was their only religion. They regarded her greed and cruelty as\r\nthe legitimate fruit of the Bible, and they would have none of it.\r\n\r\nRome had misrepresented the character of God, and perverted His\r\nrequirements, and now men rejected both the Bible and its Author. She had\r\nrequired a blind faith in her dogmas, under the pretended sanction of the\r\nScriptures. In the reaction, Voltaire and his associates cast aside God’s\r\nword altogether, and spread everywhere the poison of infidelity. Rome had\r\nground down the people under her iron heel; and now the masses, degraded\r\nand brutalized, in their recoil from her tyranny, cast off all restraint.\r\nEnraged at the glittering cheat to which they had so long paid homage,\r\nthey rejected truth and falsehood together; and mistaking license for\r\nliberty, the slaves of vice exulted in their imagined freedom.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the Revolution, by a concession of the king, the people\r\nwere granted a representation exceeding that of the nobles and the clergy\r\ncombined. Thus the balance of power was in their hands; but they were not\r\nprepared to use it with wisdom and moderation. Eager to redress the wrongs\r\nthey had suffered, they determined to undertake the reconstruction of\r\nsociety. An outraged populace, whose minds were filled with bitter and\r\nlong-treasured memories of wrong, resolved to revolutionize the state of\r\nmisery that had grown unbearable, and to revenge themselves upon those\r\nwhom they regarded as the authors of their sufferings. The oppressed\r\nwrought out the lesson they had learned under tyranny, and became the\r\noppressors of those who had oppressed them.\r\n\r\nUnhappy France reaped in blood the harvest she had sown. Terrible were the\r\nresults of her submission to the controlling power of Rome. Where France,\r\nunder the influence of Romanism, had set up the first stake at the opening\r\nof the Reformation, there the Revolution set up its first guillotine. On\r\nthe very spot where the first martyrs to the Protestant faith were burned\r\nin the sixteenth century, the first victims were guillotined in the\r\neighteenth. In repelling the gospel, which would have brought her healing,\r\nFrance had opened the door to infidelity and ruin. When the restraints of\r\nGod’s law were cast aside, it was found that the laws of man were\r\ninadequate to hold in check the powerful tides of human passion; and the\r\nnation swept on to revolt and anarchy. The war against the Bible\r\ninaugurated an era which stands in the world’s history as “The Reign of\r\nTerror.” Peace and happiness were banished from the homes and hearts of\r\nmen. No one was secure. He who triumphed to-day was suspected, condemned,\r\nto-morrow. Violence and lust held undisputed sway.\r\n\r\nKing, clergy, and nobles were compelled to submit to the atrocities of an\r\nexcited and maddened people. Their thirst for vengeance was only\r\nstimulated by the execution of the king; and those who had decreed his\r\ndeath, soon followed him to the scaffold. A general slaughter of all\r\nsuspected of hostility to the Revolution was determined. The prisons were\r\ncrowded, at one time containing more than two hundred thousand captives.\r\nThe cities of the kingdom were filled with scenes of horror. One party of\r\nrevolutionists was against another party, and France became a vast field\r\nfor contending masses, swayed by the fury of their passions. “In Paris one\r\ntumult succeeded another, and the citizens were divided into a medley of\r\nfactions, that seemed intent on nothing but mutual extermination.” And to\r\nadd to the general misery, the nation became involved in a prolonged and\r\ndevastating war with the great powers of Europe. “The country was nearly\r\nbankrupt, the armies were clamoring for arrears of pay, the Parisians were\r\nstarving, the provinces were laid waste by brigands, and civilization was\r\nalmost extinguished in anarchy and license.”\r\n\r\nAll too well the people had learned the lessons of cruelty and torture\r\nwhich Rome had so diligently taught. A day of retribution at last had\r\ncome. It was not now the disciples of Jesus that were thrust into dungeons\r\nand dragged to the stake. Long ago these had perished or been driven into\r\nexile. Unsparing Rome now felt the deadly power of those whom she had\r\ntrained to delight in deeds of blood. “The example of persecution which\r\nthe clergy of France had exhibited for so many ages, was now retorted upon\r\nthem with signal vigor. The scaffolds ran red with the blood of the\r\npriests. The galleys and the prisons, once crowded with Huguenots, were\r\nnow filled with their persecutors. Chained to the bench and toiling at the\r\noar, the Roman Catholic clergy experienced all those woes which their\r\nchurch had so freely inflicted on the gentle heretics.”(416)\r\n\r\n“Then came those days when the most barbarous of all codes was\r\nadministered by the most barbarous of all tribunals; when no man could\r\ngreet his neighbors or say his prayers ... without danger of committing a\r\ncapital crime; when spies lurked in every corner; when the guillotine was\r\nlong and hard at work every morning; when the jails were filled as close\r\nas the holds of a slave-ship; when the gutters ran foaming with blood into\r\nthe Seine.... While the daily wagon-loads of victims were carried to their\r\ndoom through the streets of Paris, the proconsuls, whom the sovereign\r\ncommittee had sent forth to the departments, reveled in an extravagance of\r\ncruelty unknown even in the capital. The knife of the deadly machine rose\r\nand fell too slow for their work of slaughter. Long rows of captives were\r\nmowed down with grape-shot. Holes were made in the bottom of crowded\r\nbarges. Lyons was turned into a desert. At Arras even the cruel mercy of a\r\nspeedy death was denied to the prisoners. All down the Loire, from Saumur\r\nto the sea, great flocks of crows and kites feasted on naked corpses,\r\ntwined together in hideous embraces. No mercy was shown to sex or age. The\r\nnumber of young lads and of girls of seventeen who were murdered by that\r\nexecrable government, is to be reckoned by hundreds. Babies torn from the\r\nbreast were tossed from pike to pike along the Jacobin ranks.”(417) In the\r\nshort space of ten years, multitudes of human beings perished.\r\n\r\nAll this was as Satan would have it. This was what for ages he had been\r\nworking to secure. His policy is deception from first to last, and his\r\nsteadfast purpose is to bring woe and wretchedness upon men, to deface and\r\ndefile the workmanship of God, to mar the divine purposes of benevolence\r\nand love, and thus cause grief in heaven. Then by his deceptive arts he\r\nblinds the minds of men, and leads them to throw back the blame of his\r\nwork upon God, as if all this misery were the result of the Creator’s\r\nplan. In like manner, when those who have been degraded and brutalized\r\nthrough his cruel power achieve their freedom, he urges them on to\r\nexcesses and atrocities. Then this picture of unbridled license is pointed\r\nout by tyrants and oppressors as an illustration of the results of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nWhen error in one garb has been detected, Satan only masks it in a\r\ndifferent disguise, and multitudes receive it as eagerly as at the first.\r\nWhen the people found Romanism to be a deception, and he could not through\r\nthis agency lead them to transgression of God’s law, he urged them to\r\nregard all religion as a cheat, and the Bible a fable; and casting aside\r\nthe divine statutes, they gave themselves up to unbridled iniquity.\r\n\r\nThe fatal error which wrought such woe for the inhabitants of France was\r\nthe ignoring of this one great truth: that true freedom lies within the\r\nproscriptions of the law of God. “O that thou hadst hearkened to My\r\ncommandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as\r\nthe waves of the sea.” “There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the\r\nwicked.” “But whoso hearkeneth unto Me shall dwell safely, and shall be\r\nquiet from fear of evil.”(418)\r\n\r\nAtheists, infidels, and apostates oppose and denounce God’s law; but the\r\nresults of their influence prove that the well-being of man is bound up\r\nwith his obedience of the divine statutes. Those who will not read the\r\nlesson from the book of God, are bidden to read it in the history of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nWhen Satan wrought through the Roman Church to lead men away from\r\nobedience, his agency was concealed, and his work was so disguised that\r\nthe degradation and misery which resulted were not seen to be the fruit of\r\ntransgression. And his power was so far counteracted by the working of the\r\nSpirit of God, that his purposes were prevented from reaching their full\r\nfruition. The people did not trace the effect to its cause, and discover\r\nthe source of their miseries. But in the Revolution, the law of God was\r\nopenly set aside by the National Council. And in the Reign of Terror which\r\nfollowed, the working of cause and effect could be seen by all.\r\n\r\nWhen France publicly rejected God and set aside the Bible, wicked men and\r\nspirits of darkness exulted in their attainment of the object so long\r\ndesired,—a kingdom free from the restraints of the law of God. Because\r\nsentence against an evil work was not speedily executed, therefore the\r\nheart of the sons of men was “fully set in them to do evil.”(419) But the\r\ntransgression of a just and righteous law must inevitably result in misery\r\nand ruin. Though not visited at once with judgments, the wickedness of men\r\nwas nevertheless surely working out their doom. Centuries of apostasy and\r\ncrime had been treasuring up wrath against the day of retribution; and\r\nwhen their iniquity was full, the despisers of God learned too late that\r\nit is a fearful thing to have worn out the divine patience. The\r\nrestraining Spirit of God, which imposes a check upon the cruel power of\r\nSatan, was in a great measure removed, and he whose only delight is the\r\nwretchedness of men, was permitted to work his will. Those who had chosen\r\nthe service of rebellion, were left to reap its fruits, until the land was\r\nfilled with crimes too horrible for pen to trace. From devastated\r\nprovinces and ruined cities a terrible cry was heard,—a cry of bitterest\r\nanguish. France was shaken as if by an earthquake. Religion, law, social\r\norder, the family, the state, and the church,—all were smitten down by the\r\nimpious hand that had been lifted against the law of God. Truly spake the\r\nwise man: “The wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.” “Though a sinner\r\ndo evil a hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that\r\nit shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before Him: but it\r\nshall not be well with the wicked.”(420) “They hated knowledge, and did\r\nnot choose the fear of the Lord;” “therefore shall they eat of the fruit\r\nof their own way, and be filled with their own devices.”(421)\r\n\r\nGod’s faithful witnesses, slain by the blasphemous power that “ascendeth\r\nout of the bottomless pit,” were not long to remain silent. “After three\r\ndays and a half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they\r\nstood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.”(422)\r\nIt was in 1793 that the decrees which abolished the Christian religion and\r\nset aside the Bible, passed the French Assembly. Three years and a half\r\nlater a resolution rescinding these decrees, thus granting toleration to\r\nthe Scriptures, was adopted by the same body. The world stood aghast at\r\nthe enormity of guilt which had resulted from a rejection of the Sacred\r\nOracles, and men recognized the necessity of faith in God and His word as\r\nthe foundation of virtue and morality. Saith the Lord, “Whom hast thou\r\nreproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice,\r\nand lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of\r\nIsrael.”(423) “Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I\r\nwill cause them to know Mine hand and My might; and they shall know that\r\nMy name is Jehovah.”(424)\r\n\r\nConcerning the two witnesses the prophet declares further: “And they heard\r\na great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they\r\nascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.”(425)\r\nSince France made war upon God’s two witnesses, they have been honored as\r\nnever before. In 1804 the British and Foreign Bible Society was organized.\r\nThis was followed by similar organizations, with numerous branches, upon\r\nthe continent of Europe. In 1816 the American Bible Society was founded.\r\nWhen the British Society was formed, the Bible had been printed and\r\ncirculated in fifty tongues. It has since been translated into more than\r\nfour hundred languages and dialects.(426)\r\n\r\nFor the fifty years preceding 1792, little attention was given to the work\r\nof foreign missions. No new societies were formed, and there were but few\r\nchurches that made any effort for the spread of Christianity in heathen\r\nlands. But toward the close of the eighteenth century a great change took\r\nplace. Men became dissatisfied with the results of rationalism, and\r\nrealized the necessity of divine revelation and experimental religion.\r\nFrom this time the work of foreign missions attained an unprecedented\r\ngrowth.(427)\r\n\r\nThe improvements in printing have given an impetus to the work of\r\ncirculating the Bible. The increased facilities for communication between\r\ndifferent countries, the breaking down of ancient barriers of prejudice\r\nand national exclusiveness, and the loss of secular power by the pontiff\r\nof Rome, have opened the way for the entrance of the word of God. For some\r\nyears the Bible has been sold without restraint in the streets of Rome,\r\nand it has now been carried to every part of the habitable globe.\r\n\r\nThe infidel Voltaire once boastingly said: “I am weary of hearing people\r\nrepeat that twelve men established the Christian religion. I will prove\r\nthat one man may suffice to overthrow it.” A century has passed since his\r\ndeath. Millions have joined in the war upon the Bible. But it is so far\r\nfrom being destroyed, that where there were a hundred in Voltaire’s time,\r\nthere are now ten thousand, yes, a hundred thousand copies of the Book of\r\nGod. In the words of an early Reformer concerning the Christian church,\r\n“The Bible is an anvil that has worn out many hammers.” Saith the Lord,\r\n“No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue\r\nthat shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn.”(428)\r\n\r\n“The word of our God shall stand forever.” “All His commandments are sure.\r\nThey stand fast forever and ever, and are done in truth and\r\nuprightness.”(429) Whatever is built upon the authority of man will be\r\noverthrown; but that which is founded upon the rock of God’s immutable\r\nword shall stand forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16. THE PILGRIM FATHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nThe English Reformers, while renouncing the doctrines of Romanism, had\r\nretained many of its forms. Thus though the authority and the creed of\r\nRome were rejected, not a few of her customs and ceremonies were\r\nincorporated into the worship of the Church of England. It was claimed\r\nthat these things were not matters of conscience; that though they were\r\nnot commanded in Scripture, and hence were non-essential, yet not being\r\nforbidden, they were not intrinsically evil. Their observance tended to\r\nnarrow the gulf which separated the reformed churches from Rome, and it\r\nwas urged that they would promote the acceptance of the Protestant faith\r\nby Romanists.\r\n\r\nTo the conservative and compromising, these arguments seemed conclusive.\r\nBut there was another class that did not so judge. The fact that these\r\ncustoms “tended to bridge over the chasm between Rome and the\r\nReformation,”(430) was in their view a conclusive argument against\r\nretaining them. They looked upon them as badges of the slavery from which\r\nthey had been delivered, and to which they had no disposition to return.\r\nThey reasoned that God has in His word established the regulations\r\ngoverning His worship, and that men are not at liberty to add to these or\r\nto detract from them. The very beginning of the great apostasy was in\r\nseeking to supplement the authority of God by that of the church. Rome\r\nbegan by enjoining what God had not forbidden, and she ended by forbidding\r\nwhat He had explicitly enjoined.\r\n\r\nMany earnestly desired to return to the purity and simplicity which\r\ncharacterized the primitive church. They regarded many of the established\r\ncustoms of the English Church as monuments of idolatry, and they could not\r\nin conscience unite in her worship. But the church, being supported by the\r\ncivil authority, would permit no dissent from her forms. Attendance upon\r\nher service was required by law, and unauthorized assemblies for religious\r\nworship were prohibited, under penalty of imprisonment, exile, and death.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the seventeenth century the monarch who had just\r\nascended the throne of England declared his determination to make the\r\nPuritans “conform, or ... harry them out of the land, or else worse.”(431)\r\nHunted, persecuted, and imprisoned, they could discern in the future no\r\npromise of better days, and many yielded to the conviction that for such\r\nas would serve God according to the dictates of their conscience, “England\r\nwas ceasing forever to be a habitable place.”(432) They were at last\r\ndetermined to seek refuge in Holland. Difficulties, losses, and\r\nimprisonment were encountered. Their purposes were thwarted, and they were\r\nbetrayed into the hands of their enemies. But steadfast perseverance\r\nfinally conquered, and they found shelter on the friendly shores of the\r\nDutch Republic.\r\n\r\nIn their flight they had left their houses, their goods, and their means\r\nof livelihood. They were strangers in a strange land, among a people of\r\ndifferent language and customs. They were forced to resort to new and\r\nuntried occupations to earn their bread. Middle-aged men, who had spent\r\ntheir lives in tilling the soil, had now to learn mechanical trades. But\r\nthey cheerfully accepted the situation, and lost no time in idleness or\r\nrepining. Though often pinched with poverty, they thanked God for the\r\nblessings which were still granted them, and found their joy in unmolested\r\nspiritual communion. “They knew they were pilgrims, and looked not much on\r\nthose things, but lifted up their eyes to heaven, their dearest country,\r\nand quieted their spirits.”(433)\r\n\r\nIn the midst of exile and hardship, their love and faith waxed strong.\r\nThey trusted the Lord’s promises, and He did not fail them in time of\r\nneed. His angels were by their side, to encourage and support them. And\r\nwhen God’s hand seemed pointing them across the sea, to a land where they\r\nmight found for themselves a state, and leave to their children the\r\nprecious heritage of religious liberty, they went forward, without\r\nshrinking, in the path of providence.\r\n\r\nGod had permitted trials to come upon His people to prepare them for the\r\naccomplishment of His gracious purpose toward them. The church had been\r\nbrought low, that she might be exalted. God was about to display His power\r\nin her behalf, to give to the world another evidence that He will not\r\nforsake those who trust in Him. He had overruled events to cause the wrath\r\nof Satan and the plots of evil men to advance His glory, and to bring His\r\npeople to a place of security. Persecution and exile were opening the way\r\nto freedom.\r\n\r\nWhen first constrained to separate from the English Church, the Puritans\r\nhad joined themselves together by a solemn covenant, as the Lord’s free\r\npeople, “to walk together in all His ways made known or to be made known\r\nto them.”(434) Here was the true spirit of reform, the vital principle of\r\nProtestantism. It was with this purpose that the Pilgrims departed from\r\nHolland to find a home in the New World. John Robinson, their pastor, who\r\nwas providentially prevented from accompanying them, in his farewell\r\naddress to the exiles said:\r\n\r\n“Brethren, we are now erelong to part asunder, and the Lord knoweth\r\nwhether I shall live ever to see your faces more. But whether the Lord\r\nhath appointed it or not, I charge you before God and His blessed angels\r\nto follow me no farther than I have followed Christ. If God should reveal\r\nanything to you by any other instrument of His, be as ready to receive it\r\nas ever you were to receive any truth of my ministry; for I am very\r\nconfident the Lord hath more truth and light yet to break forth out of His\r\nholy word.”(435)\r\n\r\n“For my part, I cannot sufficiently bewail the condition of the reformed\r\nchurches, who are come to a period in religion, and will go at present no\r\nfarther than the instruments of their reformation. The Lutherans cannot be\r\ndrawn to go beyond what Luther saw; ... and the Calvinists, you see, stick\r\nfast where they were left by that great man of God, who yet saw not all\r\nthings. This is a misery much to be lamented; for though they were burning\r\nand shining lights in their time, yet they penetrated not into the whole\r\ncounsel of God, but were they now living, would be as willing to embrace\r\nfurther light as that which they first received.”(436)\r\n\r\n“Remember your church covenant, in which you have agreed to walk in all\r\nthe ways of the Lord, made or to be made known unto you. Remember your\r\npromise and covenant with God and with one another, to receive whatever\r\nlight and truth shall be made known to you from His written word; but\r\nwithal, take heed, I beseech you, what you receive for truth, and compare\r\nit and weigh it with other scriptures of truth before you accept it; for\r\nit is not possible the Christian world should come so lately out of such\r\nthick antichristian darkness, and that full perfection of knowledge should\r\nbreak forth at once.”(437)\r\n\r\nIt was the desire for liberty of conscience that inspired the Pilgrims to\r\nbrave the perils of the long journey across the sea, to endure the\r\nhardships and dangers of the wilderness, and with God’s blessing to lay,\r\non the shores of America, the foundation of a mighty nation. Yet honest\r\nand God-fearing as they were, the Pilgrims did not yet comprehend the\r\ngreat principle of religious liberty. The freedom which they sacrificed so\r\nmuch to secure for themselves, they were not equally ready to grant to\r\nothers. “Very few, even of the foremost thinkers and moralists of the\r\nseventeenth century, had any just conception of that grand principle, the\r\noutgrowth of the New Testament, which acknowledges God as the sole judge\r\nof human faith.”(438) The doctrine that God has committed to the church\r\nthe right to control the conscience, and to define and punish heresy, is\r\none of the most deeply rooted of papal errors. While the Reformers\r\nrejected the creed of Rome, they were not entirely free from her spirit of\r\nintolerance. The dense darkness in which, through the long ages of her\r\nrule, popery had enveloped all Christendom, had not even yet been wholly\r\ndissipated. Said one of the leading ministers in the colony of\r\nMassachusetts Bay: “It was toleration that made the world antichristian;\r\nand the church never took harm by the punishment of heretics.”(439) The\r\nregulation was adopted by the colonists, that only church-members should\r\nhave a voice in the civil government. A kind of state church was formed,\r\nall the people being required to contribute to the support of the clergy,\r\nand the magistrates being authorized to suppress heresy. Thus the secular\r\npower was in the hands of the church. It was not long before these\r\nmeasures led to the inevitable result—persecution.\r\n\r\nEleven years after the planting of the first colony, Roger Williams came\r\nto the New World. Like the early Pilgrims, he came to enjoy religious\r\nfreedom; but unlike them, he saw—what so few in his time had yet seen—that\r\nthis freedom was the inalienable right of all, whatever might be their\r\ncreed. He was an earnest seeker for truth, with Robinson holding it\r\nimpossible that all the light from God’s word had yet been received.\r\nWilliams “was the first person in modern Christendom to establish civil\r\ngovernment on the doctrine of the liberty of conscience, the equality of\r\nopinions before the law.”(440) He declared it to be the duty of the\r\nmagistrate to restrain crime, but never to control the conscience. “The\r\npublic or the magistrates may decide,” he said, “what is due from man to\r\nman; but when they attempt to prescribe a man’s duties to God, they are\r\nout of place, and there can be no safety; for it is clear that if the\r\nmagistrate has the power, he may decree one set of opinions or beliefs\r\nto-day and another to-morrow; as has been done in England by different\r\nkings and queens, and by different popes and councils in the Roman Church;\r\nso that belief would become a heap of confusion.”(441)\r\n\r\nAttendance at the services of the established church was required under a\r\npenalty of fine or imprisonment. “Williams reprobated the law; the worst\r\nstatute in the English code was that which did but enforce attendance upon\r\nthe parish church. To compel men to unite with those of a different creed,\r\nhe regarded as an open violation of their natural rights; to drag to\r\npublic worship the irreligious and the unwilling, seemed only like\r\nrequiring hypocrisy.... ‘No one should be bound to worship, or,’ he added,\r\n‘to maintain a worship, against his own consent.’ ‘What!’ exclaimed his\r\nantagonists, amazed at his tenets, ‘is not the laborer worthy of his\r\nhire?’ ‘Yes,’ replied he, ‘from them that hire him.’ ”(442)\r\n\r\nRoger Williams was respected and beloved as a faithful minister, a man of\r\nrare gifts, of unbending integrity and true benevolence; yet his steadfast\r\ndenial of the right of civil magistrates to authority over the church, and\r\nhis demand for religious liberty, could not be tolerated. The application\r\nof this new doctrine, it was urged, would “subvert the fundamental state\r\nand government of the country.”(443) He was sentenced to banishment from\r\nthe colonies, and finally, to avoid arrest, he was forced to flee, amid\r\nthe cold and storms of winter, into the unbroken forest.\r\n\r\n“For fourteen weeks,” he says, “I was sorely tossed in a bitter season,\r\nnot knowing what bread or bed did mean.” But “the ravens fed me in the\r\nwilderness,” and a hollow tree often served him for a shelter.(444) Thus\r\nhe continued his painful flight through the snow and the trackless forest,\r\nuntil he found refuge with an Indian tribe whose confidence and affection\r\nhe had won while endeavoring to teach them the truths of the gospel.\r\n\r\nMaking his way at last, after months of change and wandering, to the\r\nshores of Narragansett Bay, he there laid the foundation of the first\r\nstate of modern times that in the fullest sense recognized the right of\r\nreligious freedom. The fundamental principle of Roger Williams’s colony,\r\nwas “that every man should have liberty to worship God according to the\r\nlight of his own conscience.”(445) His little State, Rhode Island, became\r\nthe asylum of the oppressed, and it increased and prospered until its\r\nfoundation principles—civil and religious liberty—became the corner-stones\r\nof the American Republic.\r\n\r\nIn that grand old document which our forefathers set forth as their bill\r\nof rights—the Declaration of Independence—they declared: “We hold these\r\ntruths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are\r\nendowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these\r\nare life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” And the Constitution\r\nguarantees, in the most explicit terms, the inviolability of conscience:\r\n“No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office\r\nof public trust under the United States.” “Congress shall make no law\r\nrespecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise\r\nthereof.”\r\n\r\n“The framers of the Constitution recognized the eternal principle that\r\nman’s relation with his God is above human legislation, and his rights of\r\nconscience inalienable. Reasoning was not necessary to establish this\r\ntruth; we are conscious of it in our own bosoms. It is this consciousness\r\nwhich, in defiance of human laws, has sustained so many martyrs in\r\ntortures and flames. They felt that their duty to God was superior to\r\nhuman enactments, and that man could exercise no authority over their\r\nconsciences. It is an inborn principle which nothing can eradicate.”(446)\r\n\r\nAs the tidings spread through the countries of Europe, of a land where\r\nevery man might enjoy the fruit of his own labor and obey the convictions\r\nof his conscience, thousands flocked to the shores of the New World.\r\nColonies rapidly multiplied. “Massachusetts, by special law, offered free\r\nwelcome and aid, at the public cost, to Christians of any nationality who\r\nmight fly beyond the Atlantic ‘to escape from wars or famine, or the\r\noppression of their persecutors.’ Thus the fugitive and the downtrodden\r\nwere, by statute, made the guests of the commonwealth.”(447) In twenty\r\nyears from the first landing at Plymouth, as many thousand Pilgrims were\r\nsettled in New England.\r\n\r\nTo secure the object which they sought, “they were content to earn a bare\r\nsubsistence by a life of frugality and toil. They asked nothing from the\r\nsoil but the reasonable returns of their own labor. No golden vision threw\r\na deceitful halo around their path.... They were content with the slow but\r\nsteady progress of their social polity. They patiently endured the\r\nprivations of the wilderness, watering the tree of liberty with their\r\ntears, and with the sweat of their brow, till it took deep root in the\r\nland.”\r\n\r\nThe Bible was held as the foundation of faith, the source of wisdom, and\r\nthe charter of liberty. Its principles were diligently taught in the home,\r\nin the school, and in the church, and its fruits were manifest in thrift,\r\nintelligence, purity, and temperance. One might be for years a dweller in\r\nthe Puritan settlements, “and not see a drunkard, or hear an oath, or meet\r\na beggar.”(448) It was demonstrated that the principles of the Bible are\r\nthe surest safeguards of national greatness. The feeble and isolated\r\ncolonies grew to a confederation of powerful States, and the world marked\r\nwith wonder the peace and prosperity of “a church without a pope, and a\r\nstate without a king.”\r\n\r\nBut continually increasing numbers were attracted to the shores of\r\nAmerica, actuated by motives widely different from those of the first\r\nPilgrims. Though the primitive faith and purity exerted a wide-spread and\r\nmoulding power, yet its influence became less and less as the numbers\r\nincreased of those who sought only worldly advantage.\r\n\r\nThe regulation adopted by the early colonists, of permitting only members\r\nof the church to vote or to hold office in the civil government, led to\r\nmost pernicious results. This measure had been accepted as a means of\r\npreserving the purity of the state, but it resulted in the corruption of\r\nthe church. A profession of religion being the condition of suffrage and\r\noffice-holding, many, actuated solely by motives of worldly policy, united\r\nwith the church without a change of heart. Thus the churches came to\r\nconsist, to a considerable extent, of unconverted persons; and even in the\r\nministry were those who not only held errors of doctrine, but who were\r\nignorant of the renewing power of the Holy Spirit. Thus again was\r\ndemonstrated the evil results, so often witnessed in the history of the\r\nchurch from the days of Constantine to the present, of attempting to build\r\nup the church by the aid of the state, of appealing to the secular power\r\nin support of the gospel of Him who declared, “My kingdom is not of this\r\nworld.”(449) The union of the church with the state, be the degree never\r\nso slight, while it may appear to bring the world nearer to the church,\r\ndoes in reality but bring the church nearer to the world.\r\n\r\nThe great principle so nobly advocated by Robinson and Roger Williams,\r\nthat truth is progressive, that Christians should stand ready to accept\r\nall the light which may shine from God’s holy word, was lost sight of by\r\ntheir descendants. The Protestant churches of America—and those of Europe\r\nas well—so highly favored in receiving the blessings of the Reformation,\r\nfailed to press forward in the path of reform. Though a few faithful men\r\narose, from time to time, to proclaim new truth and expose long-cherished\r\nerror, the majority, like the Jews in Christ’s day or the papists in the\r\ntime of Luther, were content to believe as their fathers had believed, and\r\nto live as they had lived. Therefore religion again degenerated into\r\nformalism; and errors and superstitions which would have been cast aside\r\nhad the church continued to walk in the light of God’s word, were retained\r\nand cherished. Thus the spirit inspired by the Reformation gradually died\r\nout, until there was almost as great need of reform in the Protestant\r\nchurches as in the Roman Church in the time of Luther. There was the same\r\nworldliness and spiritual stupor, a similar reverence for the opinions of\r\nmen, and substitution of human theories for the teachings of God’s word.\r\n\r\nThe wide circulation of the Bible in the early part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, and the great light thus shed upon the world, was not followed by\r\na corresponding advance in knowledge of revealed truth, or in experimental\r\nreligion. Satan could not, as in former ages, keep God’s word from the\r\npeople; it had been placed within the reach of all; but in order still to\r\naccomplish his object, he led many to value it but lightly. Men neglected\r\nto search the Scriptures, and thus they continued to accept false\r\ninterpretations, and to cherish doctrines which had no foundation in the\r\nBible.\r\n\r\nSeeing the failure of his efforts to crush out the truth by persecution,\r\nSatan had again resorted to the plan of compromise which led to the great\r\napostasy and the formation of the Church of Rome. He had induced\r\nChristians to ally themselves, not now with pagans, but with those who, by\r\ntheir devotion to the things of this world, had proved themselves to be as\r\ntruly idolaters as were the worshipers of graven images. And the results\r\nof this union were no less pernicious now than in former ages; pride and\r\nextravagance were fostered under the guise of religion, and the churches\r\nbecame corrupted. Satan continued to pervert the doctrines of the Bible,\r\nand traditions that were to ruin millions were taking deep root. The\r\nchurch was upholding and defending these traditions, instead of contending\r\nfor “the faith which was once delivered to the saints.” Thus were degraded\r\nthe principles for which the Reformers had done and suffered so much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17. HERALDS OF THE MORNING.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most solemn and yet most glorious truths revealed in the Bible\r\nis that of Christ’s second coming, to complete the great work of\r\nredemption. To God’s pilgrim people, so long left to sojourn in “the\r\nregion and shadow of death,” a precious, joy-inspiring hope is given in\r\nthe promise of His appearing, who is “the resurrection and the life,” to\r\n“bring home again His banished.” The doctrine of the second advent is the\r\nvery key-note of the Sacred Scriptures. From the day when the first pair\r\nturned their sorrowing steps from Eden, the children of faith have waited\r\nthe coming of the Promised One to break the destroyer’s power and bring\r\nthem again to the lost Paradise. Holy men of old looked forward to the\r\nadvent of the Messiah in glory, as the consummation of their hope. Enoch,\r\nonly the seventh in descent from them that dwelt in Eden, he who for three\r\ncenturies on earth walked with his God, was permitted to behold from afar\r\nthe coming of the Deliverer. “Behold,” he declared, “the Lord cometh with\r\nten thousands of His saints, to execute judgment upon all.”(450) The\r\npatriarch Job in the night of his affliction exclaimed with unshaken\r\ntrust: “I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the\r\nlatter day upon the earth: ... in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall\r\nsee for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another.”(451)\r\n\r\nThe coming of Christ to usher in the reign of righteousness, has inspired\r\nthe most sublime and impassioned utterances of the sacred writers. The\r\npoets and prophets of the Bible have dwelt upon it in words glowing with\r\ncelestial fire. The psalmist sung of the power and majesty of Israel’s\r\nKing: “Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined. Our God\r\nshall come, and shall not keep silence.... He shall call to the heavens\r\nfrom above, and to the earth, that He may judge His people.”(452) “Let the\r\nheavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad ... before the Lord: for He\r\ncometh, for He cometh to judge the earth: He shall judge the world with\r\nrighteousness, and the people with His truth.”(453)\r\n\r\nSaid the prophet Isaiah: “Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy\r\ndew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.” “Thy\r\ndead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise.” “He\r\nwill swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears\r\nfrom off all faces; and the rebuke of His people shall He take away from\r\noff all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it. And it shall be said in\r\nthat day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save\r\nus: this is the Lord; we have waited for Him, we will be glad and rejoice\r\nin His salvation.”(454)\r\n\r\nAnd Habakkuk, rapt in holy vision, beheld His appearing. “God came from\r\nTeman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. His glory covered the heavens,\r\nand the earth was full of His praise. And His brightness was as the\r\nlight.” “He stood, and measured the earth: He beheld, and drove asunder\r\nthe nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual\r\nhills did bow: His ways are everlasting.” “Thou didst ride upon Thine\r\nhorses and Thy chariots of salvation.” “The mountains saw Thee, and they\r\ntrembled: ... the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high.\r\nThe sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of Thine\r\narrows they went, and at the shining of Thy glittering spear.” “Thou\r\nwentest forth for the salvation of Thy people, even for salvation with\r\nThine anointed.”(455)\r\n\r\nWhen the Saviour was about to be separated from His disciples, He\r\ncomforted them in their sorrow with the assurance that He would come\r\nagain: “Let not your heart be troubled.... In My Father’s house are many\r\nmansions.... I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a\r\nplace for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself.”(456) “The\r\nSon of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him. Then\r\nshall He sit upon the throne of His glory: and before Him shall be\r\ngathered all nations.”(457)\r\n\r\nThe angels who lingered upon Olivet after Christ’s ascension, repeated to\r\nthe disciples the promise of His return: “This _same_ Jesus, which is\r\ntaken up from you into heaven, shall _so_ come in like manner as ye have\r\nseen Him go into heaven.”(458) And the apostle Paul, speaking by the\r\nSpirit of inspiration, testified: “The Lord _Himself_ shall descend from\r\nheaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump\r\nof God.”(459) Says the prophet of Patmos, “Behold, He cometh with clouds;\r\nand every eye shall see Him.”(460)\r\n\r\nAbout His coming cluster the glories of that “restitution of all things,\r\nwhich God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the\r\nworld began.”(461) Then the long-continued rule of evil shall be broken;\r\n“the kingdoms of this world” will become “the kingdoms of our Lord, and of\r\nHis Christ; and He shall reign forever and ever.”(462) “The glory of the\r\nLord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.” “The Lord\r\nGod will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the\r\nnations.” He shall be “for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty,\r\nunto the residue of His people.”(463)\r\n\r\nIt is then that the peaceful and long-desired kingdom of the Messiah shall\r\nbe established under the whole heaven. “The Lord shall comfort Zion: He\r\nwill comfort all her waste places; and He will make her wilderness like\r\nEden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord.” “The glory of Lebanon\r\nshall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon.” “Thou shalt\r\nno more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed\r\nDesolate: but thou shalt be called My Delight, and thy land Beulah.” “As\r\nthe bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over\r\nthee.”(464)\r\n\r\nThe coming of the Lord has been in all ages the hope of His true\r\nfollowers. The Saviour’s parting promise upon Olivet, that He would come\r\nagain, lighted up the future for His disciples, filling their hearts with\r\njoy and hope that sorrow could not quench nor trials dim. Amid suffering\r\nand persecution, “the appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus\r\nChrist” was the “blessed hope.” When the Thessalonian Christians were\r\nfilled with grief as they buried their loved ones, who had hoped to live\r\nto witness the coming of the Lord, Paul, their teacher, pointed them to\r\nthe resurrection, to take place at the Saviour’s advent. Then the dead in\r\nChrist should rise, and together with the living be caught up to meet the\r\nLord in the air. “And so,” he said, “shall we ever be with the Lord.\r\nWherefore comfort one another with these words.”(465)\r\n\r\nOn rocky Patmos the beloved disciple hears the promise, “Surely I come\r\nquickly,” and his longing response voices the prayer of the church in all\r\nher pilgrimage, “Even so, come, Lord Jesus.”(466)\r\n\r\nFrom the dungeon, the stake, the scaffold, where saints and martyrs\r\nwitnessed for the truth, comes down the centuries the utterance of their\r\nfaith and hope. Being “assured of His personal resurrection, and\r\nconsequently of their own at His coming, for this cause,” says one of\r\nthese Christians, “they despised death, and were found to be above\r\nit.”(467) They were willing to go down to the grave, that they might “rise\r\nfree.”(468) They looked for the “Lord to come from heaven in the clouds\r\nwith the glory of His Father,” “bringing to the just the times of the\r\nkingdom.” The Waldenses cherished the same faith.(469) Wycliffe looked\r\nforward to the Redeemer’s appearing as the hope of the church.(470)\r\n\r\nLuther declared: “I persuade myself verily, that the day of judgment will\r\nnot be absent full three hundred years. God will not, can not, suffer this\r\nwicked world much longer.” “The great day is drawing near in which the\r\nkingdom of abominations shall be overthrown.”(471)\r\n\r\n“This aged world is not far from its end,” said Melanchthon. Calvin bids\r\nChristians “not to hesitate, ardently desiring the day of Christ’s coming\r\nas of all events most auspicious;” and declares that “the whole family of\r\nthe faithful will keep in view that day.” “We must hunger after Christ, we\r\nmust seek, contemplate,” he says, “till the dawning of that great day,\r\nwhen our Lord will fully manifest the glory of His kingdom.”(472)\r\n\r\n“Has not our Lord Jesus carried up our flesh into heaven?” said Knox, the\r\nScotch Reformer, “and shall He not return? We know that He shall return,\r\nand that with expedition.” Ridley and Latimer, who laid down their lives\r\nfor the truth, looked in faith for the Lord’s coming. Ridley wrote: “The\r\nworld without doubt—this I do believe, and therefore I say it—draws to an\r\nend. Let us with John, the servant of God, cry in our hearts unto our\r\nSaviour Christ, Come, Lord Jesus, come.”(473)\r\n\r\n“The thoughts of the coming of the Lord,” said Baxter, “are most sweet and\r\njoyful to me.”(474) “It is the work of faith and the character of His\r\nsaints to love His appearing and to look for that blessed hope.” “If death\r\nbe the last enemy to be destroyed at the resurrection, we may learn how\r\nearnestly believers should long and pray for the second coming of Christ,\r\nwhen this full and final conquest shall be made.”(475) “This is the day\r\nthat all believers should long, and hope, and wait for, as being the\r\naccomplishment of all the work of their redemption, and all the desires\r\nand endeavors of their souls.” “Hasten, O Lord, this blessed day!”(476)\r\nSuch was the hope of the apostolic church, of the “church in the\r\nwilderness,” and of the Reformers.\r\n\r\nProphecy not only foretells the manner and object of Christ’s coming, but\r\npresents tokens by which men are to know when it is near. Said Jesus:\r\n“There shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars.”(477)\r\n“The sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the\r\nstars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be\r\nshaken. And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with\r\ngreat power and glory.”(478) The revelator thus describes the first of the\r\nsigns to precede the second advent: “There was a great earthquake; and the\r\nsun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood.”(479)\r\n\r\nThese signs were witnessed before the opening of the nineteenth century.\r\nIn fulfilment of this prophecy there occurred, in the year 1755, the most\r\nterrible earthquake that has ever been recorded. Though commonly known as\r\nthe earthquake of Lisbon, it extended to the greater part of Europe,\r\nAfrica, and America. It was felt in Greenland, in the West Indies, in the\r\nisland of Madeira, in Norway and Sweden, Great Britain and Ireland. It\r\npervaded an extent of not less than four million square miles. In Africa\r\nthe shock was almost as severe as in Europe. A great part of Algiers was\r\ndestroyed; and a short distance from Morocco, a village containing eight\r\nor ten thousand inhabitants was swallowed up. A vast wave swept over the\r\ncoast of Spain and Africa, engulfing cities, and causing great\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nIt was in Spain and Portugal that the shock manifested its extreme\r\nviolence. At Cadiz the inflowing wave was said to be sixty feet high.\r\nMountains, “some of the largest in Portugal, were impetuously shaken, as\r\nit were, from their very foundations; and some of them opened at their\r\nsummits, which were split and rent in a wonderful manner, huge masses of\r\nthem being thrown down into the adjacent valleys. Flames are related to\r\nhave issued from these mountains.”(480)\r\n\r\nAt Lisbon “a sound of thunder was heard underground, and immediately\r\nafterward a violent shock threw down the greater part of that city. In the\r\ncourse of about six minutes, sixty thousand persons perished. The sea\r\nfirst retired, and laid the bar dry; it then rolled in, rising fifty feet\r\nor more above its ordinary level.” “Among other extraordinary events\r\nrelated to have occurred at Lisbon during the catastrophe, was the\r\nsubsidence of a new quay, built entirely of marble, at an immense expense.\r\nA great concourse of people had collected there for safety, as a spot\r\nwhere they might be beyond the reach of falling ruins; but suddenly the\r\nquay sank down with all the people on it, and not one of the dead bodies\r\never floated to the surface.”(481)\r\n\r\n“The shock” of the earthquake “was instantly followed by the fall of every\r\nchurch and convent, almost all the large public buildings, and more than\r\none fourth of the houses. In about two hours after the shock, fires broke\r\nout in different quarters, and raged with such violence for the space of\r\nnearly three days, that the city was completely desolated. The earthquake\r\nhappened on a holy-day, when the churches and convents were full of\r\npeople, very few of whom escaped.”(482) “The terror of the people was\r\nbeyond description. Nobody wept; it was beyond tears. They ran hither and\r\nthither, delirious with horror and astonishment, beating their faces and\r\nbreasts, crying, ‘_Misericordia! the world’s at an end!_’ Mothers forgot\r\ntheir children, and ran about loaded with crucifixed images.\r\nUnfortunately, many ran to the churches for protection; but in vain was\r\nthe sacrament exposed; in vain did the poor creatures embrace the altars;\r\nimages, priests, and people were buried in one common ruin.” It has been\r\nestimated that ninety thousand persons lost their lives on that fatal day.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years later appeared the next sign mentioned in the\r\nprophecy,—the darkening of the sun and moon. What rendered this more\r\nstriking was the fact that the time of its fulfilment had been definitely\r\npointed out. In the Saviour’s conversation with His disciples upon Olivet,\r\nafter describing the long period of trial for the church,—the 1260 years\r\nof papal persecution, concerning which He had promised that the\r\ntribulation should be shortened,—He thus mentioned certain events to\r\nprecede His coming, and fixed the time when the first of these should be\r\nwitnessed: “In those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be\r\ndarkened, and the moon shall not give her light.”(483) The 1260 days, or\r\nyears, terminated in 1798. A quarter of a century earlier, persecution had\r\nalmost wholly ceased. Following this persecution, according to the words\r\nof Christ, the sun was to be darkened. On the 19th of May, 1780, this\r\nprophecy was fulfilled.\r\n\r\n“Almost if not altogether alone, as the most mysterious and as yet\r\nunexplained phenomenon of its kind, ... stands the dark day of May 19,\r\n1780,—a most unaccountable darkening of the whole visible heavens and\r\natmosphere in New England.”(484)\r\n\r\nAn eye-witness living in Massachusetts describes the event as follows:\r\n\r\n“In the morning the sun rose clear, but was soon overcast. The clouds\r\nbecame lowery, and from them, black and ominous, as they soon appeared,\r\nlightning flashed, thunder rolled, and a little rain fell. Toward nine\r\no’clock, the clouds became thinner, and assumed a brassy or coppery\r\nappearance, and earth, rocks, trees, buildings, water, and persons were\r\nchanged by this strange, unearthly light. A few minutes later, a heavy\r\nblack cloud spread over the entire sky except a narrow rim at the horizon,\r\nand it was as dark as it usually is at nine o’clock on a summer\r\nevening....\r\n\r\n“Fear, anxiety, and awe gradually filled the minds of the people. Women\r\nstood at the door, looking out upon the dark landscape; men returned from\r\ntheir labor in the fields; the carpenter left his tools, the blacksmith\r\nhis forge, the tradesman his counter. Schools were dismissed, and\r\ntremblingly the children fled homeward. Travelers put up at the nearest\r\nfarmhouse. ‘What is coming?’ queried every lip and heart. It seemed as if\r\na hurricane was about to dash across the land, or as if it was the day of\r\nthe consummation of all things.\r\n\r\n“Candles were used; and hearth-fires shone as brightly as on a moonless\r\nevening in autumn.... Fowls retired to their roosts and went to sleep,\r\ncattle gathered at the pasture-bars and lowed, frogs peeped, birds sang\r\ntheir evening songs, and bats flew about. But the human knew that night\r\nhad not come....\r\n\r\n“Dr. Nathanael Whittaker, pastor of the Tabernacle church in Salem, held\r\nreligious services in the meeting-house, and preached a sermon in which he\r\nmaintained that the darkness was supernatural. Congregations came together\r\nin many other places. The texts for the extemporaneous sermons were\r\ninvariably those that seemed to indicate that the darkness was consonant\r\nwith scriptural prophecy.... The darkness was most dense shortly after\r\neleven o’clock.”(485) “In most parts of the country it was so great in the\r\ndaytime, that the people could not tell the hour by either watch or clock,\r\nnor dine, nor manage their domestic business, without the light of\r\ncandles....\r\n\r\n“The extent of this darkness was extraordinary. It was observed as far\r\neast as Falmouth. To the westward it reached to the farthest part of\r\nConnecticut, and to Albany. To the southward, it was observed along the\r\nseacoasts; and to the north as far as the American settlements\r\nextend.”(486)\r\n\r\nThe intense darkness of the day was succeeded, an hour or two before\r\nevening, by a partially clear sky, and the sun appeared, though it was\r\nstill obscured by the black, heavy mist. “After sundown, the clouds came\r\nagain overhead, and it grew dark very fast.” “Nor was the darkness of the\r\nnight less uncommon and terrifying than that of the day; notwithstanding\r\nthere was almost a full moon, no object was discernible but by the help of\r\nsome artificial light, which, when seen from the neighboring houses and\r\nother places at a distance, appeared through a kind of Egyptian darkness\r\nwhich seemed almost impervious to the rays.”(487) Said an eye-witness of\r\nthe scene: “I could not help conceiving at the time, that if every\r\nluminous body in the universe had been shrouded in impenetrable shades, or\r\nstruck out of existence, the darkness could not have been more\r\ncomplete.”(488) Though at nine o’clock that night the moon rose to the\r\nfull, “it had not the least effect to dispel the deathlike shadows.” After\r\nmidnight the darkness disappeared, and the moon, when first visible, had\r\nthe appearance of blood.\r\n\r\nMay 19, 1780, stands in history as “The Dark Day.” Since the time of\r\nMoses, no period of darkness of equal density, extent, and duration, has\r\never been recorded. The description of this event, as given by\r\neye-witnesses, is but an echo of the words of the Lord, recorded by the\r\nprophet Joel, twenty-five hundred years previous to their fulfilment: “The\r\nsun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the\r\ngreat and the terrible day of the Lord come.”(489)\r\n\r\nChrist had bidden His people watch for the signs of His advent, and\r\nrejoice as they should behold the tokens of their coming King. “When these\r\nthings begin to come to pass,” He said, “then look up, and lift up your\r\nheads; for your redemption draweth nigh.” He pointed His followers to the\r\nbudding trees of spring, and said: “When they now shoot forth, ye see and\r\nknow of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand. So likewise ye,\r\nwhen ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is\r\nnigh at hand.”(490)\r\n\r\nBut as the spirit of humility and devotion in the church had given place\r\nto pride and formalism, love for Christ and faith in His coming had grown\r\ncold. Absorbed in worldliness and pleasure-seeking, the professed people\r\nof God were blinded to the Saviour’s instructions concerning the signs of\r\nHis appearing. The doctrine of the second advent had been neglected; the\r\nscriptures relating to it were obscured by misinterpretation, until it\r\nwas, to a great extent, ignored and forgotten. Especially was this the\r\ncase in the churches of America. The freedom and comfort enjoyed by all\r\nclasses of society, the ambitious desire for wealth and luxury, begetting\r\nan absorbing devotion to money-making, the eager rush for popularity and\r\npower, which seemed to be within the reach of all, led men to center their\r\ninterests and hopes on the things of this life, and to put far in the\r\nfuture that solemn day when the present order of things should pass away.\r\n\r\nWhen the Saviour pointed out to His followers the signs of His return, He\r\nforetold the state of backsliding that would exist just prior to His\r\nsecond advent. There would be, as in the days of Noah, the activity and\r\nstir of worldly business and pleasure-seeking—buying, selling, planting,\r\nbuilding, marrying, and giving in marriage—with forgetfulness of God and\r\nthe future life. For those living at this time, Christ’s admonition is:\r\n“Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with\r\nsurfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come\r\nupon you unawares.” “Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be\r\naccounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and\r\nto stand before the Son of man.”(491)\r\n\r\nThe condition of the church at this time is pointed out in the Saviour’s\r\nwords in the Revelation, “Thou hast a name that thou livest, and art\r\ndead.”(492) And to those who refuse to arouse from their careless\r\nsecurity, the solemn warning is addressed, “If therefore thou shalt not\r\nwatch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I\r\nwill come upon thee.”(493)\r\n\r\nIt was needful that men should be awakened to their danger; that they\r\nshould be roused to prepare for the solemn events connected with the close\r\nof probation. The prophet of God declares: “The day of the Lord is great\r\nand very terrible; and who can abide it?” Who shall stand when He\r\nappeareth who is “of purer eyes than to behold evil,” and cannot “look on\r\niniquity”?(494) To them that cry, “My God, we know Thee,” yet have\r\ntransgressed His covenant, and hastened after another god,(495) hiding\r\niniquity in their hearts, and loving the paths of unrighteousness,—to\r\nthese the day of the Lord is “darkness, and not light, even very dark, and\r\nno brightness in it.”(496) “It shall come to pass at that time,” saith the\r\nLord, “that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that\r\nare settled on their lees: that say in their heart, The Lord will not do\r\ngood, neither will He do evil.”(497) “I will punish the world for their\r\nevil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of\r\nthe proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the\r\nterrible.”(498) “Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to\r\ndeliver them;” “their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a\r\ndesolation.”(499)\r\n\r\nThe prophet Jeremiah, looking forward to this fearful time, exclaimed: “I\r\nam pained at my very heart.” “I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast\r\nheard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war. Destruction\r\nupon destruction is cried.”(500)\r\n\r\n“That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of\r\nwasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of\r\nclouds and thick darkness, a day of the trumpet and alarm.”(501) “Behold,\r\nthe day of the Lord cometh, ... to lay the land desolate: and He shall\r\ndestroy the sinners thereof out of it.”(502)\r\n\r\nIn view of that great day the word of God, in the most solemn and\r\nimpressive language, calls upon His people to arouse from their spiritual\r\nlethargy, and to seek His face with repentance and humiliation: “Blow ye\r\nthe trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in My holy mountain: let all the\r\ninhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the Lord cometh, for it is\r\nnigh at hand.” “Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly: gather the\r\npeople, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the\r\nchildren: ... let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride\r\nout of her closet. Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep\r\nbetween the porch and the altar.” “Turn ye even to Me with all your heart,\r\nand with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: and rend your\r\nheart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for He is\r\ngracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness.”(503)\r\n\r\nTo prepare a people to stand in the day of God, a great work of reform was\r\nto be accomplished. God saw that many of His professed people were not\r\nbuilding for eternity, and in His mercy He was about to send a message of\r\nwarning to arouse them from their stupor, and lead them to make ready for\r\nthe coming of the Lord.\r\n\r\nThis warning is brought to view in Revelation 14. Here is a threefold\r\nmessage represented as proclaimed by heavenly beings, and immediately\r\nfollowed by the coming of the Son of man “to reap the harvest of the\r\nearth.” The first of these warnings announces the approaching judgment.\r\nThe prophet beheld an angel flying “in the midst of heaven, having the\r\neverlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to\r\nevery nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud\r\nvoice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is\r\ncome: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the\r\nfountains of waters.”(504)\r\n\r\nThis message is declared to be a part of the “everlasting gospel.” The\r\nwork of preaching the gospel has not been committed to angels, but has\r\nbeen intrusted to men. Holy angels have been employed in directing this\r\nwork, they have in charge the great movements for the salvation of men;\r\nbut the actual proclamation of the gospel is performed by the servants of\r\nChrist upon the earth.\r\n\r\nFaithful men, who were obedient to the promptings of God’s Spirit and the\r\nteachings of His word, were to proclaim this warning to the world. They\r\nwere those who had taken heed to the “sure word of prophecy,” the “light\r\nthat shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star\r\narise.”(505) They had been seeking the knowledge of God more than all hid\r\ntreasures, counting it “better than the merchandise of silver, and the\r\ngain thereof than fine gold.”(506) And the Lord revealed to them the great\r\nthings of the kingdom. “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him;\r\nand He will show them His covenant.”(507)\r\n\r\nIt was not the scholarly theologians who had an understanding of this\r\ntruth, and engaged in its proclamation. Had these been faithful watchmen,\r\ndiligently and prayerfully searching the Scriptures, they would have known\r\nthe time of night; the prophecies would have opened to them the events\r\nabout to take place. But they did not occupy this position, and the\r\nmessage was given by humbler men. Said Jesus, “Walk while ye have the\r\nlight, lest darkness come upon you.”(508) Those who turn away from the\r\nlight which God has given, or who neglect to seek it when it is within\r\ntheir reach, are left in darkness. But the Saviour declares, “He that\r\nfolloweth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of\r\nlife.”(509) Whoever is with singleness of purpose seeking to do God’s\r\nwill, earnestly heeding the light already given, will receive greater\r\nlight; to that soul some star of heavenly radiance will be sent, to guide\r\nhim into all truth.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Christ’s first advent, the priests and scribes of the holy\r\ncity, to whom were intrusted the oracles of God, might have discerned the\r\nsigns of the times, and proclaimed the coming of the Promised One. The\r\nprophecy of Micah designated His birthplace;(510) Daniel specified the\r\ntime of His advent.(511) God committed these prophecies to the Jewish\r\nleaders; they were without excuse if they did not know and declare to the\r\npeople that the Messiah’s coming was at hand. Their ignorance was the\r\nresult of sinful neglect. The Jews were building monuments for the slain\r\nprophets of God, while by their deference to the great men of earth they\r\nwere paying homage to the servants of Satan. Absorbed in their ambitious\r\nstrife for place and power among men, they lost sight of the divine honors\r\nproffered them by the King of heaven.\r\n\r\nWith profound and reverent interest the elders of Israel should have been\r\nstudying the place, the time, the circumstances, of the greatest event in\r\nthe world’s history,—the coming of the Son of God to accomplish the\r\nredemption of man. All the people should have been watching and waiting\r\nthat they might be among the first to welcome the world’s Redeemer. But\r\nlo, at Bethlehem two weary travelers from the hills of Nazareth traverse\r\nthe whole length of the narrow street to the eastern extremity of the\r\ntown, vainly seeking a place of rest and shelter for the night. No doors\r\nare open to receive them. In a wretched hovel prepared for cattle, they at\r\nlast find refuge, and there the Saviour of the world is born.\r\n\r\nHeavenly angels had seen the glory which the Son of God shared with the\r\nFather before the world was, and they had looked forward with intense\r\ninterest to His appearing on earth, as an event fraught with the greatest\r\njoy to all people. Angels were appointed to carry the glad tidings to\r\nthose who were prepared to receive it, and who would joyfully make it\r\nknown to the inhabitants of the earth. Christ had stooped to take upon\r\nHimself man’s nature; He was to bear an infinite weight of woe as He\r\nshould make His soul an offering for sin; yet angels desired that even in\r\nHis humiliation, the Son of the Highest might appear before men with a\r\ndignity and glory befitting His character. Would the great men of earth\r\nassemble at Israel’s capital to greet His coming? Would legions of angels\r\npresent Him to the expectant company?\r\n\r\nAn angel visits the earth to see who are prepared to welcome Jesus. But he\r\ncan discern no tokens of expectancy. He hears no voice of praise and\r\ntriumph, that the period of Messiah’s coming is at hand. The angel hovers\r\nfor a time over the chosen city and the temple where the divine presence\r\nhas been manifested for ages; but even here is the same indifference. The\r\npriests, in their pomp and pride, are offering polluted sacrifices in the\r\ntemple. The Pharisees are with loud voices addressing the people, or\r\nmaking boastful prayers at the corners of the streets. In the palaces of\r\nkings, in the assemblies of philosophers, in the schools of the rabbis,\r\nall are alike unmindful of the wondrous fact which has filled all heaven\r\nwith joy and praise,—that the Redeemer of men is about to appear upon the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that Christ is expected, and no preparation for the\r\nPrince of life. In amazement the celestial messenger is about to return to\r\nheaven with the shameful tidings, when he discovers a group of shepherds\r\nwho are watching their flocks by night, and as they gaze into the starry\r\nheavens, are contemplating the prophecy of a Messiah to come to earth, and\r\nlonging for the advent of the world’s Redeemer. Here is a company that is\r\nprepared to receive the heavenly message. And suddenly the angel of the\r\nLord appears, declaring the good tidings of great joy. Celestial glory\r\nfloods all the plain, an innumerable company of angels is revealed, and as\r\nif the joy were too great for one messenger to bring from heaven, a\r\nmultitude of voices break forth in the anthem which all the nations of the\r\nsaved shall one day sing, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth\r\npeace, good will toward men.”(512)\r\n\r\nO, what a lesson is this wonderful story of Bethlehem! How it rebukes our\r\nunbelief, our pride and self-sufficiency. How it warns us to beware, lest\r\nby our criminal indifference we also fail to discern the signs of the\r\ntimes, and therefore know not the day of our visitation.\r\n\r\nIt was not alone upon the hills of Judea, not among the lowly shepherds\r\nonly, that angels found the watchers for Messiah’s coming. In the land of\r\nthe heathen also were those that looked for Him; they were wise men, rich\r\nand noble, the philosophers of the East. Students of nature, the magi had\r\nseen God in His handiwork. From the Hebrew Scriptures they had learned of\r\nthe Star to arise out of Jacob, and with eager desire they awaited His\r\ncoming, who should be not only the “Consolation of Israel,” but a “Light\r\nto lighten the Gentiles,” and “for salvation unto the ends of the\r\nearth.”(513) They were seekers for light, and light from the throne of God\r\nillumined the path for their feet. While the priests and rabbis of\r\nJerusalem, the appointed guardians and expounders of the truth, were\r\nshrouded in darkness, the Heaven-sent star guided these Gentile strangers\r\nto the birthplace of the new-born King.\r\n\r\nIt is “unto them that look for Him” that Christ is to “appear the second\r\ntime without sin unto salvation.”(514) Like the tidings of the Saviour’s\r\nbirth, the message of the second advent was not committed to the religious\r\nleaders of the people. They had failed to preserve their connection with\r\nGod, and had refused light from heaven; therefore they were not of the\r\nnumber described by the apostle Paul: “But ye, brethren, are not in\r\ndarkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the\r\nchildren of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night,\r\nnor of darkness.”(515)\r\n\r\nThe watchmen upon the walls of Zion should have been the first to catch\r\nthe tidings of the Saviour’s advent, the first to lift their voices to\r\nproclaim Him near, the first to warn the people to prepare for His coming.\r\nBut they were at ease, dreaming of peace and safety, while the people were\r\nasleep in their sins. Jesus saw His church, like the barren fig-tree,\r\ncovered with pretentious leaves, yet destitute of precious fruit. There\r\nwas a boastful observance of the forms of religion, while the spirit of\r\ntrue humility, penitence, and faith—which alone could render the service\r\nacceptable to God—was lacking. Instead of the graces of the Spirit, there\r\nwere manifested pride, formalism, vainglory, selfishness, oppression. A\r\nbacksliding church closed their eyes to the signs of the times. God did\r\nnot forsake them, or suffer His faithfulness to fail; but they departed\r\nfrom Him, and separated themselves from His love. As they refused to\r\ncomply with the conditions, His promises were not fulfilled to them.\r\n\r\nSuch is the sure result of neglect to appreciate and improve the light and\r\nprivileges which God bestows. Unless the church will follow on in His\r\nopening providence, accepting every ray of light, performing every duty\r\nwhich may be revealed, religion will inevitably degenerate into the\r\nobservance of forms, and the spirit of vital godliness will disappear.\r\nThis truth has been repeatedly illustrated in the history of the church.\r\nGod requires of His people works of faith and obedience corresponding to\r\nthe blessings and privileges bestowed. Obedience requires a sacrifice and\r\ninvolves a cross; and this is why so many of the professed followers of\r\nChrist refused to receive the light from heaven, and, like the Jews of\r\nold, knew not the time of their visitation.(516) Because of their pride\r\nand unbelief, the Lord passed them by, and revealed His truth to those\r\nwho, like the shepherds of Bethlehem and the Eastern magi, had given heed\r\nto all the light they had received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18. AN AMERICAN REFORMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nAn upright, honest-hearted farmer, who had been led to doubt the divine\r\nauthority of the Scriptures, yet who sincerely desired to know the truth,\r\nwas the man specially chosen of God to lead out in the proclamation of\r\nChrist’s second coming. Like many other reformers, William Miller had in\r\nearly life battled with poverty, and had thus learned the great lessons of\r\nenergy and self-denial. The members of the family from which he sprung\r\nwere characterized by an independent, liberty-loving spirit, by capability\r\nof endurance, and ardent patriotism,—traits which were also prominent in\r\nhis character. His father was a captain in the army of the Revolution, and\r\nto the sacrifices which he made in the struggles and sufferings of that\r\nstormy period, may be traced the straitened circumstances of Miller’s\r\nearly life.\r\n\r\nHe had a sound physical constitution, and even in childhood gave evidence\r\nof more than ordinary intellectual strength. As he grew older, this became\r\nmore marked. His mind was active and well developed, and he had a keen\r\nthirst for knowledge. Though he did not enjoy the advantages of a\r\ncollegiate education, his love of study and a habit of careful thought and\r\nclose criticism rendered him a man of sound judgment and comprehensive\r\nviews. He possessed an irreproachable moral character and an enviable\r\nreputation, being generally esteemed for integrity, thrift, and\r\nbenevolence. By dint of energy and application he early acquired a\r\ncompetence, though his habits of study were still maintained. He filled\r\nvarious civil and military offices with credit, and the avenues to wealth\r\nand honor seemed wide open to him.\r\n\r\nHis mother was a woman of sterling piety, and in childhood he had been\r\nsubject to religious impressions. In early manhood, however, he was thrown\r\ninto the society of deists, whose influence was the stronger from the fact\r\nthat they were mostly good citizens, and men of humane and benevolent\r\ndisposition. Living, as they did, in the midst of Christian institutions,\r\ntheir characters had been to some extent moulded by their surroundings.\r\nFor the excellencies which won them respect and confidence they were\r\nindebted to the Bible; and yet these good gifts were so perverted as to\r\nexert an influence against the word of God. By association with these men,\r\nMiller was led to adopt their sentiments. The current interpretations of\r\nScripture presented difficulties which seemed to him insurmountable; yet\r\nhis new belief, while setting aside the Bible, offered nothing better to\r\ntake its place, and he remained far from satisfied. He continued to hold\r\nthese views, however, for about twelve years. But at the age of\r\nthirty-four, the Holy Spirit impressed his heart with a sense of his\r\ncondition as a sinner. He found in his former belief no assurance of\r\nhappiness beyond the grave. The future was dark and gloomy. Referring\r\nafterward to his feelings at this time, he said:\r\n\r\n“Annihilation was a cold and chilling thought, and accountability was sure\r\ndestruction to all. The heavens were as brass over my head, and the earth\r\nas iron under my feet. Eternity—what was it? And death—why was it? The\r\nmore I reasoned, the further I was from demonstration. The more I thought,\r\nthe more scattered were my conclusions. I tried to stop thinking, but my\r\nthoughts would not be controlled. I was truly wretched, but did not\r\nunderstand the cause. I murmured and complained, but knew not of whom. I\r\nknew that there was a wrong, but knew not how or where to find the right.\r\nI mourned, but without hope.”\r\n\r\nIn this state he continued for some months. “Suddenly,” he says, “the\r\ncharacter of a Saviour was vividly impressed upon my mind. It seemed that\r\nthere might be a being so good and compassionate as to himself atone for\r\nour transgressions, and thereby save us from suffering the penalty of sin.\r\nI immediately felt how lovely such a being must be, and imagined that I\r\ncould cast myself into the arms of, and trust in the mercy of, such a one.\r\nBut the question arose, How can it be proved that such a being does exist?\r\nAside from the Bible, I found that I could get no evidence of the\r\nexistence of such a Saviour, or even of a future state....\r\n\r\n“I saw that the Bible did bring to view just such a Saviour as I needed;\r\nand I was perplexed to find how an uninspired book should develop\r\nprinciples so perfectly adapted to the wants of a fallen world. I was\r\nconstrained to admit that the Scriptures must be a revelation from God.\r\nThey became my delight; and in Jesus I found a friend. The Saviour became\r\nto me the chiefest among ten thousand; and the Scriptures, which before\r\nwere dark and contradictory, now became the lamp to my feet and light to\r\nmy path. My mind became settled and satisfied. I found the Lord God to be\r\na Rock in the midst of the ocean of life. The Bible now became my chief\r\nstudy, and I can truly say, I searched it with great delight. I found the\r\nhalf was never told me. I wondered why I had not seen its beauty and glory\r\nbefore, and marveled that I could have ever rejected it. I found\r\neverything revealed that my heart could desire, and a remedy for every\r\ndisease of the soul. I lost all taste for other reading, and applied my\r\nheart to get wisdom from God.”(517)\r\n\r\nMiller publicly professed his faith in the religion which he had despised.\r\nBut his infidel associates were not slow to bring forward all those\r\narguments which he himself had often urged against the divine authority of\r\nthe Scriptures. He was not then prepared to answer them; but he reasoned\r\nthat if the Bible is a revelation from God, it must be consistent with\r\nitself; and that as it was given for man’s instruction, it must be adapted\r\nto his understanding. He determined to study the Scriptures for himself,\r\nand ascertain if every apparent contradiction could not be harmonized.\r\n\r\nEndeavoring to lay aside all preconceived opinions, and dispensing with\r\ncommentaries, he compared scripture with scripture by the aid of the\r\nmarginal references and the concordance. He pursued his study in a regular\r\nand methodical manner; beginning with Genesis, and reading verse by verse,\r\nhe proceeded no faster than the meaning of the several passages so\r\nunfolded as to leave him free from all embarrassment. When he found\r\nanything obscure, it was his custom to compare it with every other text\r\nwhich seemed to have any reference to the matter under consideration.\r\nEvery word was permitted to have its proper bearing upon the subject of\r\nthe text, and if his view of it harmonized with every collateral passage,\r\nit ceased to be a difficulty. Thus whenever he met with a passage hard to\r\nbe understood, he found an explanation in some other portion of the\r\nScriptures. As he studied with earnest prayer for divine enlightenment,\r\nthat which had before appeared dark to his understanding was made clear.\r\nHe experienced the truth of the psalmist’s words, “The entrance of Thy\r\nwords giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.”(518)\r\n\r\nWith intense interest he studied the books of Daniel and the Revelation,\r\nemploying the same principles of interpretation as in the other\r\nscriptures, and found, to his great joy, that the prophetic symbols could\r\nbe understood. He saw that the prophecies, so far as they had been\r\nfulfilled, had been fulfilled literally; that all the various figures,\r\nmetaphors, parables, similitudes, etc., were either explained in their\r\nimmediate connection, or the terms in which they were expressed were\r\ndefined in other scriptures, and when thus explained, were to be literally\r\nunderstood. “I was thus satisfied,” he says, “that the Bible is a system\r\nof revealed truths, so clearly and simply given that the wayfaring man,\r\nthough a fool, need not err therein.”(519) Link after link of the chain of\r\ntruth rewarded his efforts, as step by step he traced down the great lines\r\nof prophecy. Angels of heaven were guiding his mind and opening the\r\nScriptures to his understanding.\r\n\r\nTaking the manner in which the prophecies had been fulfilled in the past,\r\nas a criterion by which to judge of the fulfilment of those which were\r\nstill future, he became satisfied that the popular view of the spiritual\r\nreign of Christ—a temporal millennium before the end of the world—was not\r\nsustained by the word of God. This doctrine, pointing to a thousand years\r\nof righteousness and peace before the personal coming of the Lord, put far\r\noff the terrors of the day of God. But, pleasing though it may be, it is\r\ncontrary to the teachings of Christ and His apostles, who declared that\r\nthe wheat and the tares are to grow together until the harvest, the end of\r\nthe world;(520) that “evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse;”\r\nthat “in the last days perilous times shall come;”(521) and that the\r\nkingdom of darkness shall continue until the advent of the Lord, and shall\r\nbe consumed with the spirit of His mouth, and be destroyed with the\r\nbrightness of His coming.(522)\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the world’s conversion and the spiritual reign of Christ\r\nwas not held by the apostolic church. It was not generally accepted by\r\nChristians until about the beginning of the eighteenth century. Like every\r\nother error, its results were evil. It taught men to look far in the\r\nfuture for the coming of the Lord, and prevented them from giving heed to\r\nthe signs heralding His approach. It induced a feeling of confidence and\r\nsecurity that was not well founded, and led many to neglect the\r\npreparation necessary in order to meet their Lord.\r\n\r\nMiller found the literal, personal coming of Christ to be plainly taught\r\nin the Scriptures. Says Paul, “The Lord Himself shall descend from heaven\r\nwith a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of\r\nGod.”(523) And the Saviour declares: “They shall _see_ the Son of man\r\ncoming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.” “For as the\r\nlightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall\r\nalso the coming of the Son of man be.”(524) He is to be accompanied by all\r\nthe hosts of heaven. “The Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the\r\nholy angels with Him.”(525) “And He shall send His angels with a great\r\nsound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect.”(526)\r\n\r\nAt His coming the righteous dead will be raised, and the righteous living\r\nwill be changed. “We shall not all sleep,” says Paul, “but we shall all be\r\nchanged, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for\r\nthe trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and\r\nwe shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and\r\nthis mortal must put on immortality.”(527) And in his letter to the\r\nThessalonians, after describing the coming of the Lord, he says: “The dead\r\nin Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be\r\ncaught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air:\r\nand so shall we ever be with the Lord.”\r\n\r\nNot until the personal advent of Christ can His people receive the\r\nkingdom. The Saviour said: “When the Son of man shall come in His glory,\r\nand all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His\r\nglory: and before Him shall be gathered all nations: and He shall separate\r\nthem one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:\r\nand He shall set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left.\r\nThen shall the King say unto them on His right hand, Come, ye blessed of\r\nMy Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the\r\nworld.” We have seen by the scriptures just given that when the Son of man\r\ncomes, the dead are raised incorruptible, and the living are changed. By\r\nthis great change they are prepared to receive the kingdom; for Paul says,\r\n“Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth\r\ncorruption inherit incorruption.”(528) Man in his present state is mortal,\r\ncorruptible; but the kingdom of God will be incorruptible, enduring\r\nforever. Therefore man in his present state cannot enter into the kingdom\r\nof God. But when Jesus comes, He confers immortality upon His people; and\r\nthen He calls them to inherit the kingdom of which they have hitherto been\r\nonly heirs.\r\n\r\nThese and other scriptures clearly proved to Miller’s mind that the events\r\nwhich were generally expected to take place before the coming of Christ,\r\nsuch as the universal reign of peace and the setting up of the kingdom of\r\nGod upon the earth, were to be subsequent to the second advent.\r\nFurthermore, all the signs of the times and the condition of the world\r\ncorresponded to the prophetic description of the last days. He was forced\r\nto the conclusion, from the study of Scripture alone, that the period\r\nallotted for the continuance of the earth in its present state was about\r\nto close.\r\n\r\n“Another kind of evidence that vitally affected my mind,” he says, “was\r\nthe chronology of the Scriptures.... I found that predicted events, which\r\nhad been fulfilled in the past, often occurred within a given time. The\r\none hundred and twenty years to the flood (Gen. 6:3); the seven days that\r\nwere to precede it, with forty days of predicted rain (Gen. 7:4); the four\r\nhundred years of the sojourn of Abraham’s seed (Gen. 15:13); the three\r\ndays of the butler’s and baker’s dreams (Gen. 40:12-20); the seven years\r\nof Pharaoh’s (Gen. 41:28-54); the forty years in the wilderness (Num.\r\n14:34); the three and a half years of famine (1 Kings 17:1);(529) ... the\r\nseventy years’ captivity (Jer. 25:11); Nebuchadnezzar’s seven times (Dan.\r\n4:13-16); and the seven weeks, threescore and two weeks, and the one week,\r\nmaking seventy weeks, determined upon the Jews (Dan. 9:24-27),—the events\r\nlimited by these times were all once only a matter of prophecy, and were\r\nfulfilled in accordance with the predictions.”(530)\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, he found, in his study of the Bible, various\r\nchronological periods that, according to his understanding of them,\r\nextended to the second coming of Christ, he could not but regard them as\r\nthe “times before appointed,” which God had revealed unto His servants.\r\n“The secret things,” says Moses, “belong unto the Lord our God: but those\r\nthings which are revealed belong unto us and to our children\r\nforever;”(531) and the Lord declares by the prophet Amos, that He “will do\r\nnothing, but He revealeth His secret unto His servants the prophets.”(532)\r\nThe students of God’s word may, then, confidently expect to find the most\r\nstupendous event to take place in human history clearly pointed out in the\r\nScriptures of truth.\r\n\r\n“As I was fully convinced,” says Miller, “that ‘all Scripture given by\r\ninspiration of God is profitable;’(533) that it came not at any time by\r\nthe will of man, but was written as holy men were moved by the Holy\r\nGhost,(534) and was written ‘for our learning, that we through patience\r\nand comfort of the Scriptures might have hope,’(535) I could but regard\r\nthe chronological portions of the Bible as being as much a portion of the\r\nword of God, and as much entitled to our serious consideration, as any\r\nother portion of the Scriptures. I therefore felt that in endeavoring to\r\ncomprehend what God had in His mercy seen fit to reveal to us, I had no\r\nright to pass over the prophetic periods.”(536)\r\n\r\nThe prophecy which seemed most clearly to reveal the _time_ of the second\r\nadvent was that of Dan. 8:14: “Unto two thousand and three hundred days;\r\nthen shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” Following his rule of making\r\nScripture its own interpreter, Miller learned that a day in symbolic\r\nprophecy represents a year;(537) he saw that the period of 2300 prophetic\r\ndays, or literal years, would extend far beyond the close of the Jewish\r\ndispensation, hence it could not refer to the sanctuary of that\r\ndispensation. Miller accepted the generally received view, that in the\r\nChristian age the earth is the sanctuary, and he therefore understood that\r\nthe cleansing of the sanctuary foretold in Dan. 8:14 represented the\r\npurification of the earth by fire at the second coming of Christ. If,\r\nthen, the correct starting-point could be found for the 2300 days, he\r\nconcluded that the time of the second advent could be readily ascertained.\r\nThus would be revealed the time of that great consummation, the time when\r\nthe present state, with “all its pride and power, pomp and vanity,\r\nwickedness and oppression, would come to an end;” when the curse would be\r\n“removed from off the earth, death be destroyed, reward be given to the\r\nservants of God, the prophets and saints, and them who fear His name, and\r\nthose be destroyed that destroy the earth.”(538)\r\n\r\nWith a new and deeper earnestness, Miller continued the examination of the\r\nprophecies, whole nights as well as days being devoted to the study of\r\nwhat now appeared of such stupendous importance and all-absorbing\r\ninterest. In the eighth chapter of Daniel he could find no clue to the\r\nstarting-point of the 2300 days; the angel Gabriel, though commanded to\r\nmake Daniel understand the vision, gave him only a partial explanation. As\r\nthe terrible persecution to befall the church was unfolded to the\r\nprophet’s vision, physical strength gave way. He could endure no more, and\r\nthe angel left him for a time. Daniel “fainted, and was sick certain\r\ndays.” “And I was astonished at the vision,” he says, “but none understood\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nYet God had bidden His messenger, “Make this man to understand the\r\nvision.” That commission must be fulfilled. In obedience to it, the angel,\r\nsome time afterward, returned to Daniel, saying, “I am now come forth to\r\ngive thee skill and understanding;” “therefore understand the matter, and\r\nconsider the vision.”(539) There was one important point in the vision of\r\nchapter eight which had been left unexplained, namely, that relating to\r\ntime,—the period of the 2300 days; therefore the angel, in resuming his\r\nexplanation, dwells chiefly upon the subject of time:\r\n\r\n“Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city....\r\nKnow therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the\r\ncommandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince\r\nshall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be\r\nbuilt again, and the wall, even in troublous times. And after threescore\r\nand two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for Himself.... And He\r\nshall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the\r\nweek He shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease.”\r\n\r\nThe angel had been sent to Daniel for the express purpose of explaining to\r\nhim the point which he had failed to understand in the vision of the\r\neighth chapter, the statement relative to time,—“Unto two thousand and\r\nthree hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” After bidding\r\nDaniel “understand the matter, and consider the vision,” the very first\r\nwords of the angel are, “Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and\r\nupon thy holy city.” The word here translated “determined,” literally\r\nsignifies “cut off.” Seventy weeks, representing 490 years, are declared\r\nby the angel to be cut off, as specially pertaining to the Jews. But from\r\nwhat were they cut off? As the 2300 days was the only period of time\r\nmentioned in chapter eight, it must be the period from which the seventy\r\nweeks were cut off; the seventy weeks must therefore be a part of the 2300\r\ndays, and the two periods must begin together. The seventy weeks were\r\ndeclared by the angel to date from the going forth of the commandment to\r\nrestore and build Jerusalem. If the date of this commandment could be\r\nfound, then the starting-point for the great period of the 2300 days would\r\nbe ascertained.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh chapter of Ezra the decree is found.(540) In its completest\r\nform it was issued by Artaxerxes, king of Persia, B.C. 457. But in Ezra\r\n6:14 the house of the Lord at Jerusalem is said to have been built\r\n“according to the commandment [margin, decree] of Cyrus, and Darius, and\r\nArtaxerxes king of Persia.” These three kings, in originating,\r\nre-affirming, and completing the decree, brought it to the perfection\r\nrequired by the prophecy to mark the beginning of the 2300 years. Taking\r\nB.C. 457, the time when the decree was completed, as the date of the\r\ncommandment, every specification of the prophecy concerning the seventy\r\nweeks was seen to have been fulfilled.\r\n\r\n“From the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem\r\nunto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two\r\nweeks,”—namely, sixty-nine weeks, or 483 years. The decree of Artaxerxes\r\nwent into effect in the autumn of B.C. 457. From this date, 483 years\r\nextend to the autumn of A.D. 27.(541) At that time this prophecy was\r\nfulfilled. The word “Messiah” signifies “the Anointed One.” In the autumn\r\nof A.D. 27, Christ was baptized by John, and received the anointing of the\r\nSpirit. The apostle Peter testifies that “God anointed Jesus of Nazareth\r\nwith the Holy Ghost and with power.”(542) And the Saviour Himself\r\ndeclared, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me\r\nto preach the gospel to the poor.”(543) After His baptism He went into\r\nGalilee, “preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and saying, _The\r\ntime_ is fulfilled.”(544)\r\n\r\n“And He shall confirm the covenant with many for one week.” The “week”\r\nhere brought to view is the last one of the seventy; it is the last seven\r\nyears of the period allotted especially to the Jews. During this time,\r\nextending from A.D. 27 to A.D. 34, Christ, at first in person and\r\nafterward by His disciples, extended the gospel invitation especially to\r\nthe Jews. As the apostles went forth with the good tidings of the kingdom,\r\nthe Saviour’s direction was, “Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and\r\ninto any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: but go rather to the lost\r\nsheep of the house of Israel.”(545)\r\n\r\n“In the midst of the week He shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to\r\ncease.” In A.D. 31, three and a half years after His baptism, our Lord was\r\ncrucified. With the great sacrifice offered upon Calvary, ended that\r\nsystem of offerings which for four thousand years had pointed forward to\r\nthe Lamb of God. Type had met antitype, and all the sacrifices and\r\noblations of the ceremonial system were there to cease.\r\n\r\nThe seventy weeks, or 490 years, especially allotted to the Jews, ended,\r\nas we have seen, in A.D. 34. At that time, through the action of the\r\nJewish Sanhedrim, the nation sealed its rejection of the gospel by the\r\nmartyrdom of Stephen and the persecution of the followers of Christ. Then\r\nthe message of salvation, no longer restricted to the chosen people, was\r\ngiven to the world. The disciples, forced by persecution to flee from\r\nJerusalem, “went everywhere preaching the Word.” “Philip went down to the\r\ncity of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.” Peter, divinely guided,\r\nopened the gospel to the centurion of Cæsarea, the God-fearing Cornelius;\r\nand the ardent Paul, won to the faith of Christ, was commissioned to carry\r\nthe glad tidings “far hence unto the Gentiles.”(546)\r\n\r\nThus far every specification of the prophecies is strikingly fulfilled,\r\nand the beginning of the seventy weeks is fixed beyond question at B.C.\r\n457, and their expiration in A.D. 34. From this data there is no\r\ndifficulty in finding the termination of the 2300 days. The seventy\r\nweeks—490 days—having been cut off from the 2300, there were 1810 days\r\nremaining. After the end of 490 days, the 1810 days were still to be\r\nfulfilled. From A.D. 34, 1810 years extend to 1844. Consequently the 2300\r\ndays of Dan. 8:14 terminate in 1844. At the expiration of this great\r\nprophetic period, upon the testimony of the angel of God, “the sanctuary\r\nshall be cleansed.” Thus the time of the cleansing of the sanctuary—which\r\nwas almost universally believed to take place at the second advent—was\r\ndefinitely pointed out.\r\n\r\nMiller and his associates at first believed that the 2300 days would\r\nterminate in the _spring_ of 1844, whereas the prophecy points to the\r\n_autumn_ of that year.(547) The misapprehension of this point brought\r\ndisappointment and perplexity to those who had fixed upon the earlier date\r\nas the time of the Lord’s coming. But this did not in the least affect the\r\nstrength of the argument showing that the 2300 days terminated in the year\r\n1844, and that the great event represented by the cleansing of the\r\nsanctuary must then take place.\r\n\r\nEntering upon the study of the Scriptures as he had done, in order to\r\nprove that they were a revelation from God, Miller had not, at the outset,\r\nthe slightest expectation of reaching the conclusion at which he had now\r\narrived. He himself could hardly credit the results of his investigation.\r\nBut the Scripture evidence was too clear and forcible to be set aside.\r\n\r\nHe had devoted two years to the study of the Bible, when, in 1818, he\r\nreached the solemn conviction that in about twenty-five years Christ would\r\nappear for the redemption of His people. “I need not speak,” says Miller,\r\n“of the joy that filled my heart in view of the delightful prospect, nor\r\nof the ardent longings of my soul for a participation in the joys of the\r\nredeemed. The Bible was now to me a new book. It was indeed a feast of\r\nreason; all that was dark, mystical, or obscure to me in its teachings,\r\nhad been dissipated from my mind before the clear light that now dawned\r\nfrom its sacred pages; and oh, how bright and glorious the truth appeared!\r\nAll the contradictions and inconsistencies I had before found in the Word\r\nwere gone; and although there were many portions of which I was not\r\nsatisfied I had a full understanding, yet so much light had emanated from\r\nit to the illumination of my before darkened mind, that I felt a delight\r\nin studying the Scripture which I had not before supposed could be derived\r\nfrom its teachings.”(548)\r\n\r\n“With the solemn conviction that such momentous events were predicted in\r\nthe Scriptures to be fulfilled in so short a space of time, the question\r\ncame home to me with mighty power regarding my duty to the world, in view\r\nof the evidence that had affected my own mind.”(549) He could not but feel\r\nthat it was his duty to impart to others the light which he had received.\r\nHe expected to encounter opposition from the ungodly, but was confident\r\nthat all Christians would rejoice in the hope of meeting the Saviour whom\r\nthey professed to love. His only fear was, that in their great joy at the\r\nprospect of glorious deliverance, so soon to be consummated, many would\r\nreceive the doctrine without sufficiently examining the Scriptures in\r\ndemonstration of its truth. He therefore hesitated to present it, lest he\r\nshould be in error, and be the means of misleading others. He was thus led\r\nto review the evidences in support of the conclusions at which he had\r\narrived, and to consider carefully every difficulty which presented itself\r\nto his mind. He found that objections vanished before the light of God’s\r\nword, as mist before the rays of the sun. Five years spent thus, left him\r\nfully convinced of the correctness of his position.\r\n\r\nAnd now the duty of making known to others what he believed to be so\r\nclearly taught in the Scriptures, urged itself with new force upon him.\r\n“When I was about my business,” he said, “it was continually ringing in my\r\nears, ‘Go and tell the world of their danger.’ This text was constantly\r\noccurring to me: ‘When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt\r\nsurely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that\r\nwicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at\r\nthine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from\r\nit; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou\r\nhast delivered thy soul.’(550) I felt that if the wicked could be\r\neffectually warned, multitudes of them would repent; and that if they were\r\nnot warned, their blood might be required at my hand.”(551)\r\n\r\nHe began to present his views in private as he had opportunity, praying\r\nthat some minister might feel their force and devote himself to their\r\npromulgation. But he could not banish the conviction that he had a\r\npersonal duty to perform in giving the warning. The words were ever\r\nrecurring to his mind, “Go and tell it to the world; their blood will I\r\nrequire at thy hand.” For nine years he waited, the burden still pressing\r\nupon his soul, until in 1831 he for the first time publicly gave the\r\nreasons of his faith.\r\n\r\nAs Elisha was called from following his oxen in the field, to receive the\r\nmantle of consecration to the prophetic office, so was William Miller\r\ncalled to leave his plow, and open to the people the mysteries of the\r\nkingdom of God. With trembling he entered upon his work, leading his\r\nhearers down, step by step, through the prophetic periods to the second\r\nappearing of Christ. With every effort he gained strength and courage as\r\nhe saw the wide-spread interest excited by his words.\r\n\r\nIt was only at the solicitation of his brethren, in whose words he heard\r\nthe call of God, that Miller consented to present his views in public. He\r\nwas now fifty years of age, unaccustomed to public speaking, and burdened\r\nwith a sense of unfitness for the work before him. But from the first his\r\nlabors were blessed in a remarkable manner to the salvation of souls. His\r\nfirst lecture was followed by a religious awakening in which thirteen\r\nentire families, with the exception of two persons, were converted. He was\r\nimmediately urged to speak in other places, and in nearly every place his\r\nlabor resulted in a revival of the work of God. Sinners were converted,\r\nChristians were roused to greater consecration, and deists and infidels\r\nwere led to acknowledge the truth of the Bible and the Christian religion.\r\nThe testimony of those among whom he labored was, “A class of minds are\r\nreached by him not within the influence of other men.”(552) His preaching\r\nwas calculated to arouse the public mind to the great things of religion,\r\nand to check the growing worldliness and sensuality of the age.\r\n\r\nIn nearly every town there were scores, in some, hundreds, converted as\r\nthe result of his preaching. In many places Protestant churches of nearly\r\nall denominations were thrown open to him; and the invitations to labor\r\nusually came from the ministers of the several congregations. It was his\r\ninvariable rule not to labor in any place to which he had not been\r\ninvited, yet he soon found himself unable to comply with half the requests\r\nthat poured in upon him.\r\n\r\nMany who did not accept his views as to the exact time of the second\r\nadvent, were convinced of the certainty and nearness of Christ’s coming\r\nand their need of preparation. In some of the large cities his work\r\nproduced a marked impression. Liquor-dealers abandoned the traffic, and\r\nturned their shops into meeting-rooms; gambling dens were broken up;\r\ninfidels, deists, Universalists, and even the most abandoned profligates\r\nwere reformed, some of whom had not entered a house of worship for years.\r\nPrayer-meetings were established by the various denominations, in\r\ndifferent quarters, at almost every hour, business men assembling at\r\nmidday for prayer and praise. There was no extravagant excitement, but an\r\nalmost universal solemnity on the minds of the people. His work, like that\r\nof the early Reformers, tended rather to convince the understanding and\r\narouse the conscience than merely to excite the emotions.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 Miller received a license to preach, from the Baptist Church, of\r\nwhich he was a member. A large number of the ministers of his denomination\r\nalso approved his work, and it was with their formal sanction that he\r\ncontinued his labors. He traveled and preached unceasingly, though his\r\npersonal labors were confined principally to the New England and Middle\r\nStates. For several years his expenses were met wholly from his own\r\nprivate purse, and he never afterward received enough to meet the expense\r\nof travel to the places where he was invited. Thus his public labors, so\r\nfar from being a pecuniary benefit, were a heavy tax upon his property,\r\nwhich gradually diminished during this period of his life. He was the\r\nfather of a large family, but as they were all frugal and industrious, his\r\nfarm sufficed for their maintenance as well as his own.\r\n\r\nIn 1833, two years after Miller began to present in public the evidences\r\nof Christ’s soon coming, the last of the signs appeared which were\r\npromised by the Saviour as tokens of His second advent. Said Jesus, “The\r\nstars shall fall from heaven”(553) And John in the Revelation declared, as\r\nhe beheld in vision the scenes that should herald the day of God, “The\r\nstars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig-tree casteth her\r\nuntimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.”(554) This prophecy\r\nreceived a striking and impressive fulfilment in the great meteoric shower\r\nof November 13, 1833. That was the most extensive and wonderful display of\r\nfalling stars which has ever been recorded; “the whole firmament, over all\r\nthe United States, being then, for hours, in fiery commotion! No celestial\r\nphenomenon has ever occurred in this country, since its first settlement,\r\nwhich was viewed with such intense admiration by one class in the\r\ncommunity, or with so much dread and alarm by another.” “Its sublimity and\r\nawful beauty still linger in many minds.... Never did rain fall much\r\nthicker than the meteors fell toward the earth; east, west, north, and\r\nsouth, it was the same. In a word, the whole heavens seemed in motion....\r\nThe display, as described in Professor Silliman’s Journal, was seen all\r\nover North America.... From two o’clock until broad daylight, the sky\r\nbeing perfectly serene and cloudless, an incessant play of dazzlingly\r\nbrilliant luminosities was kept up in the whole heavens.”(555)\r\n\r\n“No language, indeed, can come up to the splendor of that magnificent\r\ndisplay; ... no one who did not witness it can form an adequate conception\r\nof its glory. It seemed as if the whole starry heavens had congregated at\r\none point near the zenith, and were simultaneously shooting forth, with\r\nthe velocity of lightning, to every part of the horizon; and yet they were\r\nnot exhausted—thousands swiftly followed in the tracks of thousands, as if\r\ncreated for the occasion.”(556) “A more correct picture of a fig-tree\r\ncasting its figs when blown by a mighty wind, it was not possible to\r\nbehold.”(557)\r\n\r\nIn the New York _Journal of Commerce_ of Nov. 14, 1833, appeared a long\r\narticle regarding this wonderful phenomenon, containing this statement:\r\n“No philosopher or scholar has told or recorded an event, I suppose, like\r\nthat of yesterday morning. A prophet eighteen hundred years ago foretold\r\nit exactly, if we will be at the trouble of understanding stars falling to\r\nmean falling stars, ... in the only sense in which it is possible to be\r\nliterally true.”\r\n\r\nThus was displayed the last of those signs of His coming, concerning which\r\nJesus bade His disciples, “When ye shall see all these things, _know_ that\r\nit is near, even at the doors.”(558) After these signs, John beheld, as\r\nthe great event next impending, the heavens departing as a scroll, while\r\nthe earth quaked, mountains and islands removed out of their places, and\r\nthe wicked in terror sought to flee from the presence of the Son of\r\nman.(559)\r\n\r\nMany who witnessed the falling of the stars, looked upon it as a herald of\r\nthe coming judgment,—“an awful type, a sure forerunner, a merciful sign,\r\nof that great and dreadful day.” Thus the attention of the people was\r\ndirected to the fulfilment of prophecy, and many were led to give heed to\r\nthe warning of the second advent.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1840, another remarkable fulfilment of prophecy excited\r\nwide-spread interest. Two years before, Josiah Litch, one of the leading\r\nministers preaching the second advent, published an exposition of\r\nRevelation 9, predicting the fall of the Ottoman empire. According to his\r\ncalculations, this power was to be overthrown “in A.D. 1840, sometime in\r\nthe month of August;” and only a few days previous to its accomplishment\r\nhe wrote: “Allowing the first period, 150 years, to have been exactly\r\nfulfilled before Deacozes ascended the throne by permission of the Turks,\r\nand that the 391 years, fifteen days, commenced at the close of the first\r\nperiod, it will end on the 11th of August, 1840, when the Ottoman power in\r\nConstantinople may be expected to be broken. And this, I believe, will be\r\nfound to be the case.”(560)\r\n\r\nAt the very time specified, Turkey, through her ambassadors, accepted the\r\nprotection of the allied powers of Europe, and thus placed herself under\r\nthe control of Christian nations. The event exactly fulfilled the\r\nprediction.(561) When it became known, multitudes were convinced of the\r\ncorrectness of the principles of prophetic interpretation adopted by\r\nMiller and his associates, and a wonderful impetus was given to the Advent\r\nMovement. Men of learning and position united with Miller, both in\r\npreaching and publishing his views, and from 1840 to 1844 the work rapidly\r\nextended.\r\n\r\nWilliam Miller possessed strong mental powers, disciplined by thought and\r\nstudy; and he added to these the wisdom of heaven, by connecting himself\r\nwith the Source of wisdom. He was a man of sterling worth, who could not\r\nbut command respect and esteem wherever integrity of character and moral\r\nexcellence were valued. Uniting true kindness of heart with Christian\r\nhumility and the power of self-control, he was attentive and affable to\r\nall, ready to listen to the opinions of others, and to weigh their\r\narguments. Without passion or excitement, he tested all theories and\r\ndoctrines by the word of God; and his sound reasoning, and thorough\r\nknowledge of the Scriptures, enabled him to refute error and expose\r\nfalsehood.\r\n\r\nYet he did not prosecute his work without bitter opposition. As with\r\nearlier Reformers, the truths which he presented were not received with\r\nfavor by popular religious teachers. As these could not maintain their\r\nposition by the Scriptures, they were driven to resort to the sayings and\r\ndoctrines of men, to the traditions of the Fathers. But the word of God\r\nwas the only testimony accepted by the preachers of the advent truth. “The\r\nBible, and the Bible only,” was their watchword. The lack of Scripture\r\nargument on the part of their opponents was supplied by ridicule and\r\nscoffing. Time, means, and talents were employed in maligning those whose\r\nonly offense was that they looked with joy for the return of their Lord,\r\nand were striving to live holy lives, and to exhort others to prepare for\r\nHis appearing.\r\n\r\nEarnest were the efforts put forth to draw away the minds of the people\r\nfrom the subject of the second advent. It was made to appear a sin,\r\nsomething of which men should be ashamed, to study the prophecies which\r\nrelate to the coming of Christ and the end of the world. Thus the popular\r\nministry undermined faith in the word of God. Their teaching made men\r\ninfidels, and many took license to walk after their own ungodly lusts.\r\nThen the authors of the evil charged it all upon Adventists.\r\n\r\nWhile drawing crowded houses of intelligent and attentive hearers,\r\nMiller’s name was seldom mentioned by the religious press except by way of\r\nridicule or denunciation. The careless and ungodly, emboldened by the\r\nposition of religious teachers, resorted to opprobrious epithets, to base\r\nand blasphemous witticisms, in their efforts to heap contumely upon him\r\nand his work. The gray-headed man who had left a comfortable home to\r\ntravel at his own expense from city to city, from town to town, toiling\r\nunceasingly to bear to the world the solemn warning of the judgment near,\r\nwas sneeringly denounced as a fanatic, a liar, a speculating knave.\r\n\r\nThe ridicule, falsehood, and abuse heaped upon him called forth indignant\r\nremonstrance, even from the secular press. “To treat a subject of such\r\noverwhelming majesty and fearful consequences,” with lightness and\r\nribaldry, was declared by worldly men to be “not merely to sport with the\r\nfeelings of its propagators and advocates,” but “to make a jest of the day\r\nof judgment, to scoff at the Deity Himself, and contemn the terrors of His\r\njudgment-bar.”(562)\r\n\r\nThe instigator of all evil sought not only to counteract the effect of the\r\nadvent message, but to destroy the messenger himself. Miller made a\r\npractical application of Scripture truth to the hearts of his hearers,\r\nreproving their sins and disturbing their self-satisfaction, and his plain\r\nand cutting words aroused their enmity. The opposition manifested by\r\nchurch-members toward his message, emboldened the baser classes to go to\r\ngreater lengths; and enemies plotted to take his life as he should leave\r\nthe place of meeting. But holy angels were in the throng, and one of\r\nthese, in the form of a man, took the arm of this servant of the Lord, and\r\nled him in safety from the angry mob. His work was not yet done, and Satan\r\nand his emissaries were disappointed in their purpose.\r\n\r\nDespite all opposition, the interest in the Advent Movement had continued\r\nto increase. From scores and hundreds, the congregations had grown to as\r\nmany thousands. Large accessions had been made to the various churches,\r\nbut after a time the spirit of opposition was manifested even against\r\nthese converts, and the churches began to take disciplinary steps with\r\nthose who had embraced Miller’s views. This action called forth a response\r\nfrom his pen, in an address to Christians of all denominations, urging\r\nthat if his doctrines were false, he should be shown his error from the\r\nScriptures.\r\n\r\n“What have we believed,” he said, “that we have not been commanded to\r\nbelieve by the word of God, which you yourselves allow is the rule, and\r\nonly rule, of our faith and practice? What have we done that should call\r\ndown such virulent denunciations against us from pulpit and press, and\r\ngive you just cause to exclude us [Adventists] from your churches and\r\nfellowship?” “If we are wrong, pray show us wherein consists our wrong.\r\nShow us from the word of God that we are in error; we have had ridicule\r\nenough; that can never convince us that we are in the wrong; the word of\r\nGod alone can change our views. Our conclusions have been formed\r\ndeliberately and prayerfully, as we have seen the evidence in the\r\nScriptures.”(563)\r\n\r\nFrom age to age the warnings which God has sent to the world by His\r\nservants have been received with like incredulity and unbelief. When the\r\niniquity of the antediluvians moved Him to bring a flood of waters upon\r\nthe earth, He first made known to them His purpose, that they might have\r\nopportunity to turn from their evil ways. For a hundred and twenty years\r\nwas sounded in their ears the warning to repent, lest the wrath of God be\r\nmanifested in their destruction. But the message seemed to them an idle\r\ntale, and they believed it not. Emboldened in their wickedness, they\r\nmocked the messenger of God, made light of his entreaties, and even\r\naccused him of presumption. How dare one man stand up against all the\r\ngreat men of the earth? If Noah’s message were true, why did not all the\r\nworld see it and believe it? One man’s assertion against the wisdom of\r\nthousands! They would not credit the warning, nor would they seek shelter\r\nin the ark.\r\n\r\nScoffers pointed to the things of nature,—to the unvarying succession of\r\nthe seasons, to the blue skies that had never poured out rain, to the\r\ngreen fields refreshed by the soft dews of night,—and they cried out,\r\n“Doth he not speak parables?” In contempt they declared the preacher of\r\nrighteousness to be a wild enthusiast; and they went on, more eager in\r\ntheir pursuit of pleasure, more intent upon their evil ways, than ever\r\nbefore. But their unbelief did not hinder the predicted event. God bore\r\nlong with their wickedness, giving them ample opportunity for repentance;\r\nbut at the appointed time His judgments were visited upon the rejecters of\r\nHis mercy.\r\n\r\nChrist declares that there will exist similar unbelief concerning His\r\nsecond coming. As the people of Noah’s day “knew not until the flood came,\r\nand took them all away; so,” in the words of our Saviour, “shall also the\r\ncoming of the Son of man be.”(564) When the professed people of God are\r\nuniting with the world, living as they live, and joining with them in\r\nforbidden pleasure; when the luxury of the world becomes the luxury of the\r\nchurch; when the marriage bells are chiming, and all are looking forward\r\nto many years of worldly prosperity,—then, suddenly as the lightning\r\nflashes from the heavens, will come the end of their bright visions and\r\ndelusive hopes.\r\n\r\nAs God sent His servant to warn the world of the coming flood, so He sent\r\nchosen messengers to make known the nearness of the final judgment. And as\r\nNoah’s contemporaries laughed to scorn the predictions of the preacher of\r\nrighteousness, so in Miller’s day many, even of the professed people of\r\nGod, scoffed at the words of warning.\r\n\r\nAnd why were the doctrine and preaching of Christ’s second coming so\r\nunwelcome to the churches? While to the wicked the advent of the Lord\r\nbrings woe and desolation, to the righteous it is fraught with joy and\r\nhope. This great truth had been the consolation of God’s faithful ones\r\nthrough all the ages; why had it become, like its Author, “a stone of\r\nstumbling and a rock of offense” to His professed people? It was our Lord\r\nHimself who promised His disciples, “If I go and prepare a place for you,\r\nI will come again, and receive you unto Myself.”(565) It was the\r\ncompassionate Saviour, who, anticipating the loneliness and sorrow of His\r\nfollowers, commissioned angels to comfort them with the assurance that He\r\nwould come again in person, even as He went into heaven. As the disciples\r\nstood gazing intently upward to catch the last glimpse of Him whom they\r\nloved, their attention was arrested by the words, “Ye men of Galilee, why\r\nstand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from\r\nyou into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into\r\nheaven.”(566) Hope was kindled afresh by the angel’s message. The\r\ndisciples “returned to Jerusalem with great joy, and were continually in\r\nthe temple, praising and blessing God.”(567) They were not rejoicing\r\nbecause Jesus had been separated from them, and they were left to struggle\r\nwith the trials and temptations of the world, but because of the angel’s\r\nassurance that He would come again.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation of Christ’s coming should now be, as when made by the\r\nangels to the shepherds of Bethlehem, good tidings of great joy. Those who\r\nreally love the Saviour cannot but hail with gladness the announcement\r\nfounded upon the word of God, that He in whom their hopes of eternal life\r\nare centered, is coming again, not to be insulted, despised, and rejected,\r\nas at His first advent, but in power and glory, to redeem His people. It\r\nis those who do not love the Saviour, that desire Him to remain away; and\r\nthere can be no more conclusive evidence that the churches have departed\r\nfrom God than the irritation and animosity excited by this Heaven-sent\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\nThose who accepted the advent doctrine were roused to the necessity of\r\nrepentance and humiliation before God. Many had long been halting between\r\nChrist and the world; now they felt that it was time to take a stand. “The\r\nthings of eternity assumed to them an unwonted reality. Heaven was brought\r\nnear, and they felt themselves guilty before God.”(568) Christians were\r\nquickened to new spiritual life. They were made to feel that time was\r\nshort, that what they had to do for their fellow-men must be done quickly.\r\nEarth receded, eternity seemed to open before them, and the soul, with all\r\nthat pertains to its immortal weal or woe, was felt to eclipse every\r\ntemporal object. The Spirit of God rested upon them, and gave power to\r\ntheir earnest appeals to their brethren, as well as to sinners, to prepare\r\nfor the day of God. The silent testimony of their daily life was a\r\nconstant rebuke to formal and unconsecrated church-members. These did not\r\nwish to be disturbed in their pursuit of pleasure, their devotion to\r\nmoney-making, and their ambition for worldly honor. Hence the enmity and\r\nopposition excited against the advent faith and those who proclaimed it.\r\n\r\nAs the arguments from the prophetic periods were found to be impregnable,\r\nopposers endeavored to discourage investigation of the subject, by\r\nteaching that the prophecies were sealed. Thus Protestants followed in the\r\nsteps of Romanists. While the papal church withholds the Bible(569) from\r\nthe people, Protestant churches claimed that an important part of the\r\nsacred word—and that the part which brings to view truths specially\r\napplicable to our time—could not be understood.\r\n\r\nMinisters and people declared that the prophecies of Daniel and the\r\nRevelation were incomprehensible mysteries. But Christ directed His\r\ndisciples to the words of the prophet Daniel concerning events to take\r\nplace in their time, and said, “Whoso readeth, let him _understand_.”(570)\r\nAnd the assertion that the Revelation is a mystery, not to be understood,\r\nis contradicted by the very title of the book: “The Revelation of Jesus\r\nChrist, which God gave unto Him, to show unto His servants things which\r\nmust shortly come to pass.... _Blessed_ is he that _readeth_, and they\r\nthat _hear_ the words of this prophecy, and _keep_ those things which are\r\nwritten therein: for the time is at hand.”(571)\r\n\r\nSays the prophet: “Blessed is he that readeth”—there are those who will\r\nnot read; the blessing is not for them. “And they that hear”—there are\r\nsome, also, who refuse to hear anything concerning the prophecies; the\r\nblessing is not for this class. “And keep those things which are written\r\ntherein”—many refuse to heed the warnings and instructions contained in\r\nthe Revelation; none of these can claim the blessing promised. All who\r\nridicule the subjects of the prophecy, and mock at the symbols here\r\nsolemnly given, all who refuse to reform their lives, and prepare for the\r\ncoming of the Son of man, will be unblessed.\r\n\r\nIn view of the testimony of Inspiration, how dare men teach that the\r\nRevelation is a mystery, beyond the reach of human understanding? It is a\r\nmystery revealed, a book opened. The study of the Revelation directs the\r\nmind to the prophecies of Daniel, and both present most important\r\ninstruction, given of God to men, concerning events to take place at the\r\nclose of this world’s history.\r\n\r\nTo John were opened scenes of deep and thrilling interest in the\r\nexperience of the church. He saw the position, dangers, conflicts, and\r\nfinal deliverance of the people of God. He records the closing messages\r\nwhich are to ripen the harvest of the earth, either as sheaves for the\r\nheavenly garner or as fagots for the fires of destruction. Subjects of\r\nvast importance were revealed to him, especially for the last church, that\r\nthose who should turn from error to truth might be instructed concerning\r\nthe perils and conflicts before them. None need be in darkness in regard\r\nto what is coming upon the earth.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, this wide-spread ignorance concerning an important part of Holy\r\nWrit? Why this general reluctance to investigate its teachings? It is the\r\nresult of a studied effort of the prince of darkness to conceal from men\r\nthat which reveals his deceptions. For this reason, Christ the Revelator,\r\nforeseeing the warfare that would be waged against the study of the\r\nRevelation, pronounced a blessing upon all who should read, hear, and\r\nobserve the words of the prophecy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19. LIGHT THROUGH DARKNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nThe work of God in the earth presents, from age to age, a striking\r\nsimilarity in every great reformation or religious movement. The\r\nprinciples of God’s dealing with men are ever the same. The important\r\nmovements of the present have their parallel in those of the past, and the\r\nexperience of the church in former ages has lessons of great value for our\r\nown time.\r\n\r\nNo truth is more clearly taught in the Bible than that God by His Holy\r\nSpirit especially directs His servants on earth in the great movements for\r\nthe carrying forward of the work of salvation. Men are instruments in the\r\nhand of God, employed by Him to accomplish His purposes of grace and\r\nmercy. Each has his part to act; to each is granted a measure of light,\r\nadapted to the necessities of his time, and sufficient to enable him to\r\nperform the work which God has given him to do. But no man, however\r\nhonored of Heaven, has ever attained to a full understanding of the great\r\nplan of redemption, or even to a perfect appreciation of the divine\r\npurpose in the work for his own time. Men do not fully understand what God\r\nwould accomplish by the work which He gives them to do; they do not\r\ncomprehend, in all its bearings, the message which they utter in His name.\r\n\r\n“Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty\r\nunto perfection?” “My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your\r\nways My ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the\r\nearth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your\r\nthoughts.” “I am God, and there is none like Me, declaring the end from\r\nthe beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet\r\ndone.”(572)\r\n\r\nEven the prophets who were favored with the special illumination of the\r\nSpirit, did not fully comprehend the import of the revelations committed\r\nto them. The meaning was to be unfolded from age to age, as the people of\r\nGod should need the instruction therein contained.\r\n\r\nPeter, writing of the salvation brought to light through the gospel, says:\r\nOf this salvation “the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who\r\nprophesied of the grace that should come unto you: searching _what_, or\r\n_what manner of time_ the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify,\r\nwhen it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that\r\nshould follow. Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto _themselves_, but\r\nunto _us_ they did minister.”(573)\r\n\r\nYet while it was not given to the prophets to understand fully the things\r\nrevealed to them, they earnestly sought to obtain all the light which God\r\nhad been pleased to make manifest. They “inquired and searched\r\ndiligently,” “searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ\r\nwhich was in them did signify.” What a lesson to the people of God in the\r\nChristian age, for whose benefit these prophecies were given to His\r\nservants! “Unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves, but unto us\r\nthey did minister.” Witness those holy men of God as they “inquired and\r\nsearched diligently” concerning revelations given them for generations\r\nthat were yet unborn. Contrast their holy zeal with the listless unconcern\r\nwith which the favored ones of later ages treat this gift of heaven. What\r\na rebuke to the ease-loving, world-loving indifference which is content to\r\ndeclare that the prophecies cannot be understood.\r\n\r\nThough the finite minds of men are inadequate to enter into the counsels\r\nof the Infinite One, or to understand fully the working out of His\r\npurposes, yet often it is because of some error or neglect on their own\r\npart, that they so dimly comprehend the messages of Heaven. Not\r\ninfrequently the minds of the people, and even of God’s servants, are so\r\nblinded by human opinions, the traditions and false teaching of men, that\r\nthey are able only partially to grasp the great things which He has\r\nrevealed in His word. Thus it was with the disciples of Christ, even when\r\nthe Saviour was with them in person. Their minds had become imbued with\r\nthe popular conception of the Messiah as a temporal prince, who was to\r\nexalt Israel to the throne of universal empire, and they could not\r\nunderstand the meaning of His words foretelling His sufferings and death.\r\n\r\nChrist Himself had sent them forth with the message, “The time is\r\nfulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the\r\ngospel.”(574) That message was based on the prophecy of Daniel 9. The\r\nsixty-nine weeks were declared by the angel to extend to “the Messiah the\r\nPrince,” and with high hopes and joyful anticipations the disciples looked\r\nforward to the establishment of Messiah’s kingdom at Jerusalem, to rule\r\nover the whole earth.\r\n\r\nThey preached the message which Christ had committed to them, though they\r\nthemselves misapprehended its meaning. While their announcement was\r\nfounded on Dan. 9:25, they did not see, in the next verse of the same\r\nchapter, that Messiah was to be cut off. From their very birth their\r\nhearts had been set upon the anticipated glory of an earthly empire, and\r\nthis blinded their understanding alike to the specifications of the\r\nprophecy and to the words of Christ.\r\n\r\nThey performed their duty in presenting to the Jewish nation the\r\ninvitation of mercy, and then, at the very time when they expected to see\r\ntheir Lord ascend the throne of David, they beheld Him seized as a\r\nmalefactor, scourged, derided, and condemned, and lifted up on the cross\r\nof Calvary. What despair and anguish wrung the hearts of those disciples\r\nduring the days while their Lord was sleeping in the tomb!\r\n\r\nChrist had come at the exact time and in the manner foretold by prophecy.\r\nThe testimony of Scripture had been fulfilled in every detail of His\r\nministry. He had preached the message of salvation, and “His word was with\r\npower.” The hearts of His hearers had witnessed that it was of Heaven. The\r\nword and the Spirit of God attested the divine commission of His Son.\r\n\r\nThe disciples still clung with undying affection to their beloved Master.\r\nAnd yet their minds were shrouded in uncertainty and doubt. In their\r\nanguish they did not then recall the words of Christ pointing forward to\r\nHis suffering and death. If Jesus of Nazareth had been the true Messiah,\r\nwould they have been thus plunged in grief and disappointment? This was\r\nthe question that tortured their souls while the Saviour lay in His\r\nsepulcher during the hopeless hours of that Sabbath which intervened\r\nbetween His death and His resurrection.\r\n\r\nThough the night of sorrow gathered dark about these followers of Jesus,\r\nyet were they not forsaken. Saith the prophet: “When I sit in darkness,\r\nthe Lord shall be a light unto me.... He will bring me forth to the light,\r\nand I shall behold His righteousness.” “Yea, the darkness hideth not from\r\nThee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are\r\nboth alike to Thee.” God hath spoken: “Unto the upright there ariseth\r\nlight in the darkness.” “I will bring the blind by a way that they knew\r\nnot; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make\r\ndarkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will\r\nI do unto them, and not forsake them.”(575)\r\n\r\nThe announcement which had been made by the disciples in the name of the\r\nLord was in every particular correct, and the events to which it pointed\r\nwere even then taking place. “The time is fulfilled, the kingdom of God is\r\nat hand,” had been their message. At the expiration of “the time”—the\r\nsixty-nine weeks of Daniel 9, which were to extend to the Messiah, “the\r\nAnointed One”—Christ had received the anointing of the Spirit, after His\r\nbaptism by John in Jordan. And the “kingdom of God” which they had\r\ndeclared to be at hand, was established by the death of Christ. This\r\nkingdom was not, as they had been taught to believe, an earthly empire.\r\nNor was it that future, immortal kingdom which shall be set up when “the\r\nkingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole\r\nheaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High;” that\r\neverlasting kingdom, in which “all dominions shall serve and obey\r\nHim.”(576) As used in the Bible, the expression “kingdom of God” is\r\nemployed to designate both the kingdom of grace and the kingdom of glory.\r\nThe kingdom of grace is brought to view by Paul in the Epistle to the\r\nHebrews. After pointing to Christ, the compassionate intercessor who is\r\n“touched with the feeling of our infirmities,” the apostle says, “Let us\r\ntherefore come boldly unto _the throne of grace_, that we may obtain\r\nmercy, and find grace.”(577) The throne of grace represents the kingdom of\r\ngrace; for the existence of a throne implies the existence of a kingdom.\r\nIn many of His parables, Christ uses the expression, “the kingdom of\r\nheaven,” to designate the work of divine grace upon the hearts of men.\r\n\r\nSo the throne of glory represents the kingdom of glory; and this kingdom\r\nis referred to in the Saviour’s words, “When the Son of man shall come in\r\nHis glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the\r\nthrone of His glory: and before Him shall be gathered all nations.”(578)\r\nThis kingdom is yet future. It is not to be set up until the second advent\r\nof Christ.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of grace was instituted immediately after the fall of man,\r\nwhen a plan was devised for the redemption of the guilty race. It then\r\nexisted in the purpose and by the promise of God; and through faith, men\r\ncould become its subjects. Yet it was not actually established until the\r\ndeath of Christ. Even after entering upon His earthly mission, the\r\nSaviour, wearied with the stubbornness and ingratitude of men, might have\r\ndrawn back from the sacrifice of Calvary. In Gethsemane the cup of woe\r\ntrembled in His hand. He might even then have wiped the blood-sweat from\r\nHis brow, and have left the guilty race to perish in their iniquity. Had\r\nHe done this, there could have been no redemption for fallen men. But when\r\nthe Saviour yielded up His life, and with His expiring breath cried out,\r\n“It is finished,” then the fulfilment of the plan of redemption was\r\nassured. The promise of salvation made to the sinful pair in Eden was\r\nratified. The kingdom of grace, which had before existed by the promise of\r\nGod, was then established.\r\n\r\nThus the death of Christ—the very event which the disciples had looked\r\nupon as the final destruction of their hope—was that which made it forever\r\nsure. While it had brought them a cruel disappointment, it was the climax\r\nof proof that their belief had been correct. The event that had filled\r\nthem with mourning and despair, was that which opened the door of hope to\r\nevery child of Adam, and in which centered the future life and eternal\r\nhappiness of all God’s faithful ones in all the ages.\r\n\r\nPurposes of infinite mercy were reaching their fulfilment, even through\r\nthe disappointment of the disciples. While their hearts had been won by\r\nthe divine grace and power of His teaching, who “spake as never man\r\nspake,” yet intermingled with the pure gold of their love for Jesus, was\r\nthe base alloy of worldly pride and selfish ambitions. Even in the\r\nPassover chamber, at that solemn hour when their Master was already\r\nentering the shadow of Gethsemane, there was “a strife among them, which\r\nof them should be accounted the greatest.”(579) Their vision was filled\r\nwith the throne, the crown, and the glory, while just before them lay the\r\nshame and agony of the garden, the judgment-hall, the cross of Calvary. It\r\nwas their pride of heart, their thirst for worldly glory, that had led\r\nthem to cling so tenaciously to the false teaching of their time, and to\r\npass unheeded the Saviour’s words showing the true nature of His kingdom,\r\nand pointing forward to His agony and death. And these errors resulted in\r\nthe trial—sharp but needful—which was permitted for their correction.\r\nThough the disciples had mistaken the meaning of their message, and had\r\nfailed to realize their expectations, yet they had preached the warning\r\ngiven them of God, and the Lord would reward their faith and honor their\r\nobedience. To them was to be intrusted the work of heralding to all\r\nnations the glorious gospel of their risen Lord. It was to prepare them\r\nfor this work, that the experience which seemed to them so bitter had been\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\nAfter His resurrection, Jesus appeared to His disciples on the way to\r\nEmmaus, and “beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto\r\nthem in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.”(580) The hearts\r\nof the disciples were stirred. Faith was kindled. They were “begotten\r\nagain unto a lively hope,” even before Jesus revealed Himself to them. It\r\nwas His purpose to enlighten their understanding, and to fasten their\r\nfaith upon the “sure word of prophecy.” He wished the truth to take firm\r\nroot in their minds, not merely because it was supported by His personal\r\ntestimony, but because of the unquestionable evidence presented by the\r\nsymbols and shadows of the typical law, and by the prophecies of the Old\r\nTestament. It was needful for the followers of Christ to have an\r\nintelligent faith, not only in their own behalf, but that they might carry\r\nthe knowledge of Christ to the world. And as the very first step in\r\nimparting this knowledge, Jesus directed the disciples to “Moses and the\r\nprophets.” Such was the testimony given by the risen Saviour to the value\r\nand importance of the Old Testament Scriptures.\r\n\r\nWhat a change was wrought in the hearts of the disciples, as they looked\r\nonce more on the loved countenance of their Master!(581) In a more\r\ncomplete and perfect sense than ever before, they had “found Him, of whom\r\nMoses in the law, and the prophets, did write.” The uncertainty, the\r\nanguish, the despair, gave place to perfect assurance, to unclouded faith.\r\nWhat marvel that after His ascension they “were continually in the temple,\r\npraising and blessing God.” The people, knowing only of the Saviour’s\r\nignominious death, looked to see in their faces the expression of sorrow,\r\nconfusion, and defeat; but they saw there gladness and triumph. What a\r\npreparation these disciples had received for the work before them! They\r\nhad passed through the deepest trial which it was possible for them to\r\nexperience, and had seen how, when to human vision all was lost, the word\r\nof God had been triumphantly accomplished. Henceforward what could daunt\r\ntheir faith, or chill the ardor of their love? In the keenest sorrow they\r\nhad “strong consolation,” a hope which was as “an anchor of the soul, both\r\nsure and steadfast.”(582) They had been witness to the wisdom and power of\r\nGod, and they were “persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels,\r\nnor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,\r\nnor height, nor depth, nor any other creature,” would be able to separate\r\nthem from “the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” “In all\r\nthese things,” they said, “we are more than conquerors through Him that\r\nloved us.”(583) “The word of the Lord endureth forever.”(584) And “who is\r\nhe that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is _risen\r\nagain_, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession\r\nfor us.”(585)\r\n\r\nSaith the Lord: “My people shall never be ashamed.”(586) “Weeping may\r\nendure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.”(587) When on His\r\nresurrection day these disciples met the Saviour, and their hearts burned\r\nwithin them as they listened to His words; when they looked upon the head\r\nand hands and feet that had been bruised for them; when, before His\r\nascension, Jesus led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up His hands\r\nin blessing, bade them, “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel,”\r\nadding, “Lo, I am with you alway;”(588) when on the day of Pentecost the\r\npromised Comforter descended, and the power from on high was given, and\r\nthe souls of the believers thrilled with the conscious presence of their\r\nascended Lord,—then, even though, like His, their pathway led through\r\nsacrifice and martyrdom, would they have exchanged the ministry of the\r\ngospel of His grace, with the “crown of righteousness” to be received at\r\nHis coming, for the glory of an earthly throne, which had been the hope of\r\ntheir earlier discipleship? He who is “able to do exceeding abundantly\r\nabove all that we ask or think,” had granted them, with the fellowship of\r\nHis sufferings, the communion of His joy,—the joy of “bringing many sons\r\nunto glory,” joy unspeakable, “an eternal weight of glory,” to which, says\r\nPaul, “our light affliction, which is but for a moment,” is “not worthy to\r\nbe compared.”\r\n\r\nThe experience of the disciples who preached the “gospel of the kingdom”\r\nat the first advent of Christ, had its counterpart in the experience of\r\nthose who proclaimed the message of His second advent. As the disciples\r\nwent out preaching, “The time is fulfilled, the kingdom of God is at\r\nhand,” so Miller and his associates proclaimed that the longest and last\r\nprophetic period brought to view in the Bible was about to expire, that\r\nthe judgment was at hand, and the everlasting kingdom was to be ushered\r\nin. The preaching of the disciples in regard to time was based on the\r\nseventy weeks of Daniel 9. The message given by Miller and his associates\r\nannounced the termination of the 2300 days of Dan. 8:14, of which the\r\nseventy weeks form a part. The preaching of each was based upon the\r\nfulfilment of a different portion of the same great prophetic period.\r\n\r\nLike the first disciples, William Miller and his associates did not,\r\nthemselves, fully comprehend the import of the message which they bore.\r\nErrors that had been long established in the church prevented them from\r\narriving at a correct interpretation of an important point in the\r\nprophecy. Therefore, though they proclaimed the message which God had\r\ncommitted to them to be given to the world, yet through a misapprehension\r\nof its meaning, they suffered disappointment.\r\n\r\nIn explaining Dan. 8:14, “Unto two thousand and three hundred days, then\r\nshall the sanctuary be cleansed,” Miller, as has been stated, adopted the\r\ngenerally received view that the earth is the sanctuary, and he believed\r\nthat the cleansing of the sanctuary represented the purification of the\r\nearth by fire at the coming of the Lord. When, therefore, he found that\r\nthe close of the 2300 days was definitely foretold, he concluded that this\r\nrevealed the time of the second advent. His error resulted from accepting\r\nthe popular view as to what constitutes the sanctuary.\r\n\r\nIn the typical system, which was a shadow of the sacrifice and priesthood\r\nof Christ, the cleansing of the sanctuary was the last service performed\r\nby the high priest in the yearly round of ministration. It was the closing\r\nwork of the atonement,—a removal or putting away of sin from Israel. It\r\nprefigured the closing work in the ministration of our High Priest in\r\nheaven, in the removal or blotting out of the sins of His people, which\r\nare registered in the heavenly records. This service involves a work of\r\ninvestigation, a work of judgment; and it immediately precedes the coming\r\nof Christ in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory; for when He\r\ncomes, every case has been decided. Says Jesus, “My reward is with Me, to\r\ngive every man according as his work shall be.”(589) It is this work of\r\njudgment, immediately preceding the second advent, that is announced in\r\nthe first angel’s message of Rev. 14:7, “Fear God, and give glory to Him;\r\nfor the hour of His judgment is come.”\r\n\r\nThose who proclaimed this warning gave the right message at the right\r\ntime. But as the early disciples declared, “The time is fulfilled, and the\r\nkingdom of God is at hand,” based on the prophecy of Daniel 9, while they\r\nfailed to perceive that the death of the Messiah was foretold in the same\r\nscripture; so Miller and his associates preached the message based on Dan.\r\n8:14 and Rev. 14:7, and failed to see that there were still other messages\r\nbrought to view in Revelation 14, which were also to be given before the\r\nadvent of the Lord. As the disciples were mistaken in regard to the\r\nkingdom to be set up at the end of the seventy weeks, so Adventists were\r\nmistaken in regard to the event to take place at the expiration of the\r\n2300 days. In both cases there was an acceptance of, or rather an\r\nadherence to, popular errors that blinded the mind to the truth. Both\r\nclasses fulfilled the will of God in delivering the message which He\r\ndesired to be given, and both, through their own misapprehension of their\r\nmessage, suffered disappointment.\r\n\r\nYet God accomplished His own beneficent purpose in permitting the warning\r\nof the judgment to be given just as it was. The great day was at hand, and\r\nin His providence the people were brought to the test of a definite time,\r\nin order to reveal to them what was in their hearts. The message was\r\ndesigned for the testing and purification of the church. They were to be\r\nled to see whether their affections were set upon this world or upon\r\nChrist and heaven. They professed to love the Saviour; now they were to\r\nprove their love. Were they ready to renounce their worldly hopes and\r\nambitions, and welcome with joy the advent of their Lord? The message was\r\ndesigned to enable them to discern their true spiritual state; it was sent\r\nin mercy to arouse them to seek the Lord with repentance and humiliation.\r\n\r\nThe disappointment also, though the result of their own misapprehension of\r\nthe message which they gave, was to be overruled for good. It would test\r\nthe hearts of those who had professed to receive the warning. In the face\r\nof their disappointment, would they rashly give up their experience, and\r\ncast away their confidence in God’s word? or would they, in prayer and\r\nhumility, seek to discern where they had failed to comprehend the\r\nsignificance of the prophecy? How many had moved from fear, or from\r\nimpulse and excitement? How many were half-hearted and unbelieving?\r\nMultitudes professed to love the appearing of the Lord. When called to\r\nendure the scoffs and reproach of the world, and the test of delay and\r\ndisappointment, would they renounce the faith? Because they did not\r\nimmediately understand the dealings of God with them, would they cast\r\naside truths sustained by the clearest testimony of His word?\r\n\r\nThis test would reveal the strength of those who with real faith had\r\nobeyed what they believed to be the teaching of the word and the Spirit of\r\nGod. It would teach them, as only such an experience could, the danger of\r\naccepting the theories and interpretations of men, instead of making the\r\nBible its own interpreter. To the children of faith the perplexity and\r\nsorrow resulting from their error, would work the needed correction. They\r\nwould be led to a closer study of the prophetic word. They would be taught\r\nto examine more carefully the foundation of their faith, and to reject\r\neverything, however widely accepted by the Christian world, that was not\r\nfounded upon the Scriptures of truth.\r\n\r\nWith these believers, as with the first disciples, that which in the hour\r\nof trial seemed dark to their understanding, would afterward be made\r\nplain. When they should see the “end of the Lord,” they would know that\r\nnotwithstanding the trial resulting from their errors, His purposes of\r\nlove toward them had been steadily fulfilling. They would learn by a\r\nblessed experience that He is “very pitiful, and of tender mercy;” that\r\nall His paths “are mercy and truth unto such as keep His covenant and His\r\ntestimonies.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20. A GREAT RELIGIOUS AWAKENING.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nA great religious awakening under the proclamation of Christ’s soon\r\ncoming, is foretold in the prophecy of the first angel’s message of\r\nRevelation 14. An angel is seen flying “in the midst of heaven, having the\r\neverlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to\r\nevery nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.” “With a loud voice” he\r\nproclaims the message, “Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of\r\nHis judgment is come: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the\r\nsea, and the fountains of waters.”(590)\r\n\r\nThe fact that an angel is said to be the herald of this warning, is\r\nsignificant. By the purity, the glory, and the power of the heavenly\r\nmessenger, divine wisdom has been pleased to represent the exalted\r\ncharacter of the work to be accomplished by the message, and the power and\r\nglory that were to attend it. And the angel’s flight “in the midst of\r\nheaven,” the “loud voice” with which the warning is uttered, and its\r\npromulgation to all “that dwell on the earth,”—“to every nation, and\r\nkindred, and tongue, and people,”—give evidence of the rapidity and\r\nworld-wide extent of the movement.\r\n\r\nThe message itself sheds light as to the time when this movement is to\r\ntake place. It is declared to be a part of the “everlasting gospel;” and\r\nit announces the opening of the judgment. The message of salvation has\r\nbeen preached in all ages; but this message is a part of the gospel which\r\ncould be proclaimed only in the last days, for only then would it be true\r\nthat the hour of judgment _had come_. The prophecies present a succession\r\nof events leading down to the opening of the judgment. This is especially\r\ntrue of the book of Daniel. But that part of his prophecy which related to\r\nthe last days, Daniel was bidden to close up and seal “to the time of the\r\nend.” Not till we reach this time could a message concerning the judgment\r\nbe proclaimed, based on a fulfilment of these prophecies. But at the time\r\nof the end, says the prophet, “many shall run to and fro, and knowledge\r\nshall be increased.”(591)\r\n\r\nThe apostle Paul warned the church not to look for the coming of Christ in\r\nhis day. “That day shall not come,” he says, “except there come a falling\r\naway first, and that man of sin be revealed.”(592) Not till after the\r\ngreat apostasy, and the long period of the reign of the “man of sin,” can\r\nwe look for the advent of our Lord. The “man of sin,” which is also styled\r\nthe “mystery of iniquity,” the “son of perdition,” and “that wicked,”\r\nrepresents the papacy, which, as foretold in prophecy, was to maintain its\r\nsupremacy for 1260 years. This period ended in 1798. The coming of Christ\r\ncould not take place before that time. Paul covers with his caution the\r\nwhole of the Christian dispensation down to the year 1798. It is this side\r\nof that time that the message of Christ’s second coming is to be\r\nproclaimed.\r\n\r\nNo such message has ever been given in past ages. Paul, as we have seen,\r\ndid not preach it; he pointed his brethren into the then far-distant\r\nfuture for the coming of the Lord. The Reformers did not proclaim it.\r\nMartin Luther placed the judgment about three hundred years in the future\r\nfrom his day. But since 1798 the book of Daniel has been unsealed,\r\nknowledge of the prophecies has increased, and many have proclaimed the\r\nsolemn message of the judgment near.\r\n\r\nLike the great Reformation of the sixteenth century, the Advent Movement\r\nappeared in different countries of Christendom at the same time. In both\r\nEurope and America, men of faith and prayer were led to the study of the\r\nprophecies, and tracing down the inspired record, they saw convincing\r\nevidence that the end of all things was at hand. In different lands there\r\nwere isolated bodies of Christians who, solely by the study of the\r\nScriptures, arrived at the belief that the Saviour’s advent was near.\r\n\r\nIn 1821, three years after Miller had arrived at his exposition of the\r\nprophecies pointing to the time of the judgment, Dr. Joseph Wolff, “the\r\nmissionary to the world,” began to proclaim the Lord’s soon coming. Wolff\r\nwas born in Germany, of Hebrew parentage, his father being a Jewish rabbi.\r\nWhile very young, he was convinced of the truth of the Christian religion.\r\nOf an active, inquiring mind, he had been an eager listener to the\r\nconversations that took place in his father’s house, as devout Hebrews\r\ndaily assembled to recount the hopes and anticipations of their people,\r\nthe glory of the coming Messiah, and the restoration of Israel. One day\r\nhearing Jesus of Nazareth mentioned, the boy inquired who He was. “A Jew\r\nof the greatest talent,” was the answer; “but as He pretended to be the\r\nMessiah, the Jewish tribunal sentenced Him to death.” “Why,” rejoined the\r\nquestioner, “is Jerusalem destroyed, and why are we in captivity?” “Alas,\r\nalas!” answered his father, “because the Jews murdered the prophets.” The\r\nthought was at once suggested to the child, “Perhaps Jesus was also a\r\nprophet, and the Jews killed Him when He was innocent.”(593) So strong was\r\nthis feeling, that though forbidden to enter a Christian church, he would\r\noften linger outside to listen to the preaching.\r\n\r\nWhen only seven years old, he was boasting to an aged Christian neighbor\r\nof the future triumph of Israel at the advent of the Messiah, when the old\r\nman said kindly, “Dear boy, I will tell you who the real Messiah was: He\r\nwas Jesus of Nazareth, ... whom your ancestors have crucified, as they did\r\nthe prophets of old. Go home and read the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah,\r\nand you will be convinced that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”(594)\r\nConviction at once fastened upon him. He went home and read the scripture,\r\nwondering to see how perfectly it had been fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth.\r\nWere the words of the Christian true? The boy asked of his father an\r\nexplanation of the prophecy, but was met with a silence so stern that he\r\nnever again dared to refer to the subject. This, however, only increased\r\nhis desire to know more of the Christian religion.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge he sought was studiously kept from him in his Jewish home;\r\nbut when only eleven years old, he left his father’s house, and went out\r\ninto the world to gain for himself an education, to choose his religion\r\nand his life-work. He found a home for a time with kinsmen, but was soon\r\ndriven from them as an apostate, and alone and penniless he had to make\r\nhis own way among strangers. He went from place to place, studying\r\ndiligently, and maintaining himself by teaching Hebrew. Through the\r\ninfluence of a Catholic instructor, he was led to accept the Romish faith,\r\nand formed the purpose of becoming a missionary to his own people. With\r\nthis object he went, a few years later, to pursue his studies in the\r\nCollege of the Propaganda at Rome. Here his habit of independent thought\r\nand candid speech brought upon him the imputation of heresy. He openly\r\nattacked the abuses of the church, and urged the necessity of reform.\r\nThough at first treated with special favor by the papal dignitaries, he\r\nwas after a time removed from Rome. Under the surveillance of the church\r\nhe went from place to place, until it became evident that he could never\r\nbe brought to submit to the bondage of Romanism. He was declared to be\r\nincorrigible, and was left at liberty to go where he pleased. He now made\r\nhis way to England, and professing the Protestant faith, united with the\r\nEnglish Church. After two years’ study he set out, in 1821, upon his\r\nmission. While Wolff accepted the great truth of Christ’s first advent as\r\n“a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief,” he saw that the prophecies\r\nbring to view with equal clearness His second advent with power and glory.\r\nAnd while he sought to lead his people to Jesus of Nazareth as the\r\nPromised One, and to point them to His first coming in humiliation as a\r\nsacrifice for the sins of men, he taught them also of His second coming as\r\na king and deliverer.\r\n\r\n“Jesus of Nazareth, the true Messiah,” he said, “whose hands and feet were\r\npierced, who was brought like a lamb to the slaughter, who was the Man of\r\nsorrows and acquainted with grief, who after the scepter was taken from\r\nJudah, and the legislative power from between his feet, came the first\r\ntime; shall come the second time in the clouds of heaven, and with the\r\ntrump of the Archangel,”(595) “and shall stand upon the Mount of Olives;\r\nand that dominion, once consigned to Adam over the creation, and forfeited\r\nby him (Gen. 1:26; 3:17), shall be given to Jesus. He shall be king over\r\nall the earth. The groanings and lamentations of the creation shall cease,\r\nbut songs of praises and thanksgivings shall be heard.... When Jesus comes\r\nin the glory of His Father, with the holy angels, ... the dead believers\r\nshall rise first. 1 Thess. 4:16; 1 Cor. 15: 23. This is what we Christians\r\ncall the first resurrection. Then the animal kingdom shall change its\r\nnature (Isa. 11:6-9), and be subdued unto Jesus. Psalm 8. Universal peace\r\nshall prevail.”(596) “The Lord again shall look down upon the earth, and\r\nsay, ‘Behold, it is very good.’ ”(597)\r\n\r\nWolff believed the coming of the Lord to be at hand, his interpretation of\r\nthe prophetic periods placing the great consummation within a very few\r\nyears of the time pointed out by Miller. To those who urged from the\r\nscripture, “Of that day and hour knoweth no man,” that men are to know\r\nnothing concerning the nearness of the advent, Wolff replied: “Did our\r\nLord say that that day and hour should _never_ be known? Did He not give\r\nus signs of the times, in order that we may know at least the _approach_\r\nof His coming, as one knows the approach of the summer by the fig-tree\r\nputting forth its leaves? Matt. 24:32. Are we never to know that period,\r\nwhilst He Himself exhorteth us not only to read Daniel the prophet, but to\r\nunderstand it? and in that very Daniel, where it is said that the words\r\nwere shut up to the time of the end (which was the case in his time), and\r\nthat ‘many shall run to and fro’ (a Hebrew expression for observing and\r\nthinking upon the time), ‘and _knowledge_’ (regarding that time) ‘shall be\r\nincreased.’ Dan. 12:4. Besides this, our Lord does not intend to say by\r\nthis, that the _approach_ of the time shall not be known, but that the\r\n_exact_ ‘_day_ and _hour_ knoweth no man.’ Enough, He does say, shall be\r\nknown by the signs of the times, to induce us to prepare for His coming,\r\nas Noah prepared the ark.”(598)\r\n\r\nConcerning the popular system of interpreting, or misinterpreting, the\r\nScriptures, Wolff wrote: “The greater part of the Christian church have\r\nswerved from the plain sense of Scripture, and have turned to the\r\nphantomizing system of the Buddhists, who believe that the future\r\nhappiness of mankind will consist in moving about in the air, and suppose\r\nthat when they are reading _Jews_, they must understand _Gentiles_; and\r\nwhen they read _Jerusalem_, they must understand the _church_; and if it\r\nis said _earth_, it means _sky_; and for the coming of the _Lord_ they\r\nmust understand the progress of the _missionary societies_; and going up\r\nto the mountain of the Lord’s house, signifies a grand _class-meeting of\r\nMethodists_.”(599)\r\n\r\nDuring the twenty-four years from 1821 to 1845, Wolff traveled\r\nextensively: in Africa, visiting Egypt and Abyssinia; in Asia, traversing\r\nPalestine, Syria, Persia, Bokhara, and India. He also visited the United\r\nStates, on the journey thither preaching on the island of St. Helena. He\r\narrived in New York in August, 1837; and after speaking in that city, he\r\npreached in Philadelphia and Baltimore, and finally proceeded to\r\nWashington. Here, he says, “on a motion brought forward by the\r\nex-president, John Quincy Adams, in one of the houses of Congress, the\r\nHouse unanimously granted to me the use of the Congress Hall for a\r\nlecture, which I delivered on a Saturday, honored with the presence of all\r\nthe members of Congress, and also of the bishop of Virginia, and of the\r\nclergy and citizens of Washington. The same honor was granted to me by the\r\nmembers of the government of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, in whose\r\npresence I delivered lectures on my researches in Asia, and also on the\r\npersonal reign of Jesus Christ.”(600)\r\n\r\nDr. Wolff traveled in the most barbarous countries, without the protection\r\nof any European authority, enduring many hardships, and surrounded with\r\ncountless perils. He was bastinadoed and starved, sold as a slave, and\r\nthree times condemned to death. He was beset by robbers, and sometimes\r\nnearly perished from thirst. Once he was stripped of all that he\r\npossessed, and left to travel hundreds of miles on foot through the\r\nmountains, the snow beating in his face, and his naked feet benumbed by\r\ncontact with the frozen ground.\r\n\r\nWhen warned against going unarmed among savage and hostile tribes, he\r\ndeclared himself “provided with arms,”—“prayer, zeal for Christ, and\r\nconfidence in His help.” “I am also,” he said, “provided with the love of\r\nGod and my neighbor in my heart, and the Bible is in my hand.”(601) The\r\nBible in Hebrew and English he carried with him wherever he went. Of one\r\nof his later journeys he says, “I ... kept the Bible open in my hand. I\r\nfelt my power was in the book, and that its might would sustain me.”(602)\r\n\r\nThus he persevered in his labors until the message of the judgment had\r\nbeen carried to a large part of the habitable globe. Among Jews, Turks,\r\nParsees, Hindoos, and many other nationalities and races, he distributed\r\nthe word of God in these various tongues, and everywhere heralded the\r\napproaching reign of the Messiah.\r\n\r\nIn his travels in Bokhara he found the doctrine of the Lord’s soon coming\r\nheld by a remote and isolated people. The Arabs of Yemen, he says, “are in\r\npossession of a book called ‘Seera,’ which gives notice of the second\r\ncoming of Christ and His reign in glory; and they expect great events to\r\ntake place in the year 1840.”(603) “In Yemen ... I spent six days with the\r\nchildren of Rechab. They drink no wine, plant no vineyard, sow no seed,\r\nand live in tents, and remember good old Jonadab, the son of Rechab; and I\r\nfound in their company children of Israel, of the tribe of Dan, ... who\r\nexpect, with the children of Rechab, the speedy arrival of the Messiah in\r\nthe clouds of heaven.”(604)\r\n\r\nA similar belief was found by another missionary to exist in Tartary. A\r\nTartar priest put the question to the missionary, as to when Christ would\r\ncome the second time. When the missionary answered that he knew nothing\r\nabout it, the priest seemed greatly surprised at such ignorance in one who\r\nprofessed to be a Bible teacher, and stated his own belief, founded on\r\nprophecy, that Christ would come about 1844.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1826 the advent message began to be preached in England. The\r\nmovement here did not take so definite a form as in America; the exact\r\ntime of the advent was not so generally taught, but the great truth of\r\nChrist’s soon coming in power and glory was extensively proclaimed. And\r\nthis not among the dissenters and non-conformists only. Mourant Brock, an\r\nEnglish writer, states that about seven hundred ministers of the Church of\r\nEngland were engaged in preaching this “gospel of the kingdom.” The\r\nmessage pointing to 1844 as the time of the Lord’s coming was also given\r\nin Great Britain. Advent publications from the United States were widely\r\ncirculated. Books and journals were republished in England. And in 1842,\r\nRobert Winter, an Englishman by birth, who had received the advent faith\r\nin America, returned to his native country to herald the coming of the\r\nLord. Many united with him in the work, and the message of the judgment\r\nwas proclaimed in various parts of England.\r\n\r\nIn South America, in the midst of barbarism and priestcraft, Lacunza, a\r\nSpaniard and a Jesuit, found his way to the Scriptures, and thus received\r\nthe truth of Christ’s speedy return. Impelled to give the warning, yet\r\ndesiring to escape the censures of Rome, he published his views under the\r\nassumed name of “Rabbi Ben-Israel,” representing himself as a converted\r\nJew. Lacunza lived in the eighteenth century, but it was about 1825 that\r\nhis book, having found its way to London, was translated into the English\r\nlanguage. Its publication served to deepen the interest already awakening\r\nin England in the subject of the second advent.\r\n\r\nIn Germany the doctrine had been taught in the eighteenth century by\r\nBengel, a minister in the Lutheran Church, and a celebrated biblical\r\nscholar and critic. Upon completing his education, Bengel had “devoted\r\nhimself to the study of theology, to which the grave and religious tone of\r\nhis mind, deepened and strengthened by his early training and discipline,\r\nnaturally inclined him. Like other young men of thoughtful character,\r\nbefore and since, he had to struggle with doubts and difficulties of a\r\nreligious nature, and he alludes, with much feeling, to the ‘many arrows\r\nwhich pierced his poor heart, and made his youth hard to bear.’ ”(605)\r\nBecoming a member of the consistory of Würtemberg, he advocated the cause\r\nof religious liberty. “While maintaining the rights and privileges of the\r\nchurch, he was an advocate for all reasonable freedom being accorded to\r\nthose who felt themselves bound, on grounds of conscience, to withdraw\r\nfrom her communion.”(606) The good effects of this policy are still felt\r\nin his native province.\r\n\r\nIt was while preparing a sermon from Revelation 21 for “Advent Sunday”\r\nthat the light of Christ’s second coming broke in upon Bengel’s mind. The\r\nprophecies of the Revelation unfolded to his understanding as never\r\nbefore. Overwhelmed with a sense of the stupendous importance and\r\nsurpassing glory of the scenes presented by the prophet, he was forced to\r\nturn for a time from the contemplation of the subject. In the pulpit it\r\nagain presented itself to him with all its vividness and power. From that\r\ntime he devoted himself to the study of the prophecies, especially those\r\nof the Apocalypse, and soon arrived at the belief that they pointed to the\r\ncoming of Christ as near. The date which he fixed upon as the time of the\r\nsecond advent was within a very few years of that afterward held by\r\nMiller.\r\n\r\nBengel’s writings have been spread throughout Christendom. His views of\r\nprophecy were quite generally received in his own state of Würtemberg, and\r\nto some extent in other parts of Germany. The movement continued after his\r\ndeath, and the advent message was heard in Germany at the same time that\r\nit was attracting attention in other lands. At an early date some of the\r\nbelievers went to Russia, and there formed colonies, and the faith of\r\nChrist’s soon coming is still held by the German churches of that country.\r\n\r\nThe light shone also in France and Switzerland. At Geneva, where Farel and\r\nCalvin had spread the truths of the Reformation, Gaussen preached the\r\nmessage of the second advent. While a student at school, Gaussen had\r\nencountered that spirit of rationalism which pervaded all Europe during\r\nthe latter part of the eighteenth and the opening of the nineteenth\r\ncentury; and when he entered the ministry he was not only ignorant of true\r\nfaith, but inclined to skepticism. In his youth he had become interested\r\nin the study of prophecy. After reading Rollin’s “Ancient History,” his\r\nattention was called to the second chapter of Daniel, and he was struck\r\nwith the wonderful exactness with which the prophecy had been fulfilled,\r\nas seen in the historian’s record. Here was a testimony to the inspiration\r\nof the Scriptures, which served as an anchor to him amid the perils of\r\nlater years. He could not rest satisfied with the teachings of\r\nrationalism, and in studying the Bible and searching for clearer light he\r\nwas, after a time, led to a positive faith.\r\n\r\nAs he pursued his investigation of the prophecies, he arrived at the\r\nbelief that the coming of the Lord was at hand. Impressed with the\r\nsolemnity and importance of this great truth, he desired to bring it\r\nbefore the people; but the popular belief that the prophecies of Daniel\r\nare mysteries and cannot be understood, was a serious obstacle in his way.\r\nHe finally determined—as Farel had done before him in evangelizing\r\nGeneva—to begin with the children, through whom he hoped to interest the\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n“I desire this to be understood,” he afterward said, speaking of his\r\nobject in this undertaking, “it is not because of its small importance,\r\nbut on the contrary because of its great value, that I wished to present\r\nit in this familiar form, and that I addressed it to the children. I\r\ndesired to be heard, and I feared that I would not be if I addressed\r\nmyself to the grown people first.” “I determined therefore to go to the\r\nyoungest. I gather an audience of children; if the group enlarges, if it\r\nis seen that they listen, are pleased, interested, that they understand\r\nand explain the subject, I am sure to have a second circle soon, and in\r\ntheir turn, grown people will see that it is worth their while to sit down\r\nand study. When this is done, the cause is gained.”(607)\r\n\r\nThe effort was successful. As he addressed the children, older persons\r\ncame to listen. The galleries of his church were filled with attentive\r\nhearers. Among them were men of rank and learning, and strangers and\r\nforeigners visiting Geneva; and thus the message was carried to other\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this success, Gaussen published his lessons, with the hope\r\nof promoting the study of the prophetic books in the churches of the\r\nFrench-speaking people. “To publish instruction given to the children,”\r\nsays Gaussen, “is to say to adults, who too often neglect such books under\r\nthe false pretense that they are obscure, ‘How can they be obscure, since\r\nyour children understand them?’ ” “I had a great desire,” he adds, “to\r\nrender a knowledge of the prophecies popular in our flocks, if possible.”\r\n“There is no study, indeed, which it seems to me answers the needs of the\r\ntime better.” “It is by this that we are to prepare for the tribulation\r\nnear at hand, and watch and wait for Jesus Christ.”\r\n\r\nThough one of the most distinguished and beloved of preachers in the\r\nFrench language, Gaussen was after a time suspended from the ministry, his\r\nprincipal offense being that instead of the church’s catechism, a tame and\r\nrationalistic manual, almost destitute of positive faith, he had used the\r\nBible in giving instruction to the youth. He afterward became teacher in a\r\ntheological school, while on Sunday he continued his work as catechist,\r\naddressing the children, and instructing them in the Scriptures. His works\r\non prophecy also excited much interest. From the professor’s chair,\r\nthrough the press, and in his favorite occupation as teacher of children,\r\nhe continued for many years to exert an extensive influence, and was\r\ninstrumental in calling the attention of many to the study of the\r\nprophecies which showed that the coming of the Lord was near.\r\n\r\nIn Scandinavia also the advent message was proclaimed, and a wide-spread\r\ninterest was kindled. Many were roused from their careless security, to\r\nconfess and forsake their sins, and seek pardon in the name of Christ. But\r\nthe clergy of the state church opposed the movement, and through their\r\ninfluence some who preached the message were thrown into prison. In many\r\nplaces where the preachers of the Lord’s soon coming were thus silenced,\r\nGod was pleased to send the message, in a miraculous manner, through\r\nlittle children. As they were under age, the law of the state could not\r\nrestrain them, and they were permitted to speak unmolested.\r\n\r\nThe movement was chiefly among the lower class, and it was in the humble\r\ndwellings of the laborers that the people assembled to hear the warning.\r\nThe child-preachers themselves were mostly poor cottagers. Some of them\r\nwere not more than six or eight years of age; and while their lives\r\ntestified that they loved the Saviour, and were trying to live in\r\nobedience to God’s holy requirements, they ordinarily manifested only the\r\nintelligence and ability usually seen in children of that age. When\r\nstanding before the people, however, it was evident that they were moved\r\nby an influence beyond their own natural gifts. Tone and manner changed,\r\nand with solemn power they gave the warning of the judgment, employing the\r\nvery words of Scripture, “Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of\r\nHis judgment is come.” They reproved the sins of the people, not only\r\ncondemning immorality and vice, but rebuking worldliness and backsliding,\r\nand warning their hearers to make haste to flee from the wrath to come.\r\n\r\nThe people heard with trembling. The convicting Spirit of God spoke to\r\ntheir hearts. Many were led to search the Scriptures with new and deeper\r\ninterest, the intemperate and immoral were reformed, others abandoned\r\ntheir dishonest practices, and a work was done so marked that even\r\nministers of the state church were forced to acknowledge that the hand of\r\nGod was in the movement.\r\n\r\nIt was God’s will that the tidings of the Saviour’s coming should be given\r\nin the Scandinavian countries; and when the voices of His servants were\r\nsilenced, He put His Spirit upon the children, that the work might be\r\naccomplished. When Jesus drew near to Jerusalem attended by the rejoicing\r\nmultitudes that, with shouts of triumph and the waving of palm branches,\r\nheralded Him as the Son of David, the jealous Pharisees called upon Him to\r\nsilence them; but Jesus answered that all this was in fulfilment of\r\nprophecy, and if these should hold their peace, the very stones would cry\r\nout. The people, intimidated by the threats of the priests and rulers,\r\nceased their joyful proclamation as they entered the gates of Jerusalem;\r\nbut the children in the temple courts afterward took up the refrain, and\r\nwaving their branches of palm, they cried, “Hosanna to the Son of\r\nDavid!”(608) When the Pharisees, sorely displeased, said unto Him,\r\n“Hearest Thou what these say?” Jesus answered, “Yea; have ye never read,\r\nOut of the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise?” As\r\nGod wrought through children at the time of Christ’s first advent, so He\r\nwrought through them in giving the message of His second advent. God’s\r\nword must be fulfilled, that the proclamation of the Saviour’s coming\r\nshould be given to all peoples, tongues, and nations.\r\n\r\nTo William Miller and his co-laborers it was given to preach the warning\r\nin America. This country became the center of the great Advent Movement.\r\nIt was here that the prophecy of the first angel’s message had its most\r\ndirect fulfilment. The writings of Miller and his associates were carried\r\nto distant lands. Wherever missionaries had penetrated in all the world,\r\nwere sent the glad tidings of Christ’s speedy return. Far and wide spread\r\nthe message of the everlasting gospel, “Fear God, and give glory to Him;\r\nfor the hour of His judgment is come.”\r\n\r\nThe testimony of the prophecies which seemed to point to the coming of\r\nChrist in the spring of 1844, took deep hold of the minds of the people.\r\nAs the message went from State to State, there was everywhere awakened\r\nwide-spread interest. Many were convinced that the arguments from the\r\nprophetic periods were correct, and sacrificing their pride of opinion,\r\nthey joyfully received the truth. Some ministers laid aside their\r\nsectarian views and feelings, left their salaries and their churches, and\r\nunited in proclaiming the coming of Jesus. There were comparatively few\r\nministers, however, who would accept this message; therefore it was\r\nlargely committed to humble laymen. Farmers left their fields, mechanics\r\ntheir tools, traders their merchandise, professional men their positions;\r\nand yet the number of workers was small in comparison with the work to be\r\naccomplished. The condition of an ungodly church and a world lying in\r\nwickedness, burdened the souls of the true watchmen, and they willingly\r\nendured toil, privation, and suffering, that they might call men to\r\nrepentance unto salvation. Though opposed by Satan, the work went steadily\r\nforward, and the advent truth was accepted by many thousands.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the searching testimony was heard, warning sinners, both\r\nworldlings and church-members, to flee from the wrath to come. Like John\r\nthe Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, the preachers laid the axe at the\r\nroot of the tree, and urged all to bring forth fruit meet for repentance.\r\nTheir stirring appeals were in marked contrast to the assurances of peace\r\nand safety that were heard from popular pulpits; and wherever the message\r\nwas given, it moved the people. The simple, direct testimony of the\r\nScriptures, set home by the power of the Holy Spirit, brought a weight of\r\nconviction which few were able wholly to resist. Professors of religion\r\nwere roused from their false security. They saw their backslidings, their\r\nworldliness and unbelief, their pride and selfishness. Many sought the\r\nLord with repentance and humiliation. The affections that had so long\r\nclung to earthly things they now fixed upon heaven. The Spirit of God\r\nrested upon them, and with hearts softened and subdued they joined to\r\nsound the cry, “Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His\r\njudgment is come.”\r\n\r\nSinners inquired with weeping, “What must I do to be saved?” Those whose\r\nlives had been marked with dishonesty were anxious to make restitution.\r\nAll who found peace in Christ longed to see others share the blessing. The\r\nhearts of parents were turned to their children, and the hearts of\r\nchildren to their parents. The barriers of pride and reserve were swept\r\naway. Heartfelt confessions were made, and the members of the household\r\nlabored for the salvation of those who were nearest and dearest. Often was\r\nheard the sound of earnest intercession. Everywhere were souls in deep\r\nanguish, pleading with God. Many wrestled all night in prayer for the\r\nassurance that their own sins were pardoned, or for the conversion of\r\ntheir relatives or neighbors.\r\n\r\nAll classes flocked to the Adventist meetings. Rich and poor, high and\r\nlow, were, from various causes, anxious to hear for themselves the\r\ndoctrine of the second advent. The Lord held the spirit of opposition in\r\ncheck while His servants explained the reasons of their faith. Sometimes\r\nthe instrument was feeble; but the Spirit of God gave power to His truth.\r\nThe presence of holy angels was felt in these assemblies, and many were\r\ndaily added to the believers. As the evidences of Christ’s soon coming\r\nwere repeated, vast crowds listened in breathless silence to the solemn\r\nwords. Heaven and earth seemed to approach each other. The power of God\r\nwas felt upon old and young and middle-aged. Men sought their homes with\r\npraises upon their lips, and the glad sound rang out upon the still night\r\nair. None who attended those meetings can ever forget those scenes of\r\ndeepest interest.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation of a definite time for Christ’s coming called forth great\r\nopposition from many of all classes, from the minister in the pulpit down\r\nto the most reckless, Heaven-daring sinner. The words of prophecy were\r\nfulfilled: “There shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after\r\ntheir own lusts, and saying, ‘Where is the promise of His coming?’ for\r\nsince the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the\r\nbeginning of the creation.”(609) Many who professed to love the Saviour,\r\ndeclared that they had no opposition to the doctrine of the second advent;\r\nthey merely objected to the definite time. But God’s all-seeing eye read\r\ntheir hearts. They did not wish to hear of Christ’s coming to judge the\r\nworld in righteousness. They had been unfaithful servants, their works\r\nwould not bear the inspection of the heart-searching God, and they feared\r\nto meet their Lord. Like the Jews at the time of Christ’s first advent,\r\nthey were not prepared to welcome Jesus. They not only refused to listen\r\nto the plain arguments from the Bible, but ridiculed those who were\r\nlooking for the Lord. Satan and his angels exulted, and flung the taunt in\r\nthe face of Christ and holy angels, that His professed people had so\r\nlittle love for Him that they did not desire His appearing.\r\n\r\n“No man knoweth the day nor the hour,” was the argument most often brought\r\nforward by rejecters of the advent faith. The scripture is, “Of that day\r\nand hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but My Father\r\nonly.”(610) A clear and harmonious explanation of this text was given by\r\nthose who were looking for the Lord, and the wrong use made of it by their\r\nopponents was clearly shown. The words were spoken by Christ in that\r\nmemorable conversation with His disciples upon Olivet, after He had for\r\nthe last time departed from the temple. The disciples had asked the\r\nquestion, “What shall be the sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the\r\nworld?” Jesus gave them signs, and said, “When ye shall see all these\r\nthings, know that it is near, even at the doors.”(611) One saying of the\r\nSaviour must not be made to destroy another. Though no man knoweth the\r\n_day_ nor the _hour_ of His coming, we are instructed and required to know\r\nwhen it is near. We are further taught that to disregard His warning, and\r\nrefuse or neglect to know when His advent is near, will be as fatal for us\r\nas it was for those who lived in the days of Noah not to know when the\r\nflood was coming. And the parable in the same chapter, contrasting the\r\nfaithful and the unfaithful servant, and giving the doom of him who said\r\nin his heart, “My Lord delayeth His coming,” shows in what light Christ\r\nwill regard and reward those whom He finds watching, and teaching His\r\ncoming, and those denying it. “Watch therefore,” He says; “blessed is that\r\nservant, whom his Lord when He cometh shall find so doing.”(612) “If\r\ntherefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou\r\nshalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.”(613)\r\n\r\nPaul speaks of a class to whom the Lord’s appearing will come unawares.\r\n“The day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they\r\nshall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, ...\r\nand they shall not escape.” But He adds, to those who have given heed to\r\nthe Saviour’s warning, “Ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day\r\nshould overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and the\r\nchildren of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.”(614)\r\n\r\nThus it was shown that Scripture gives no warrant for men to remain in\r\nignorance concerning the nearness of Christ’s coming. But those who\r\ndesired only an excuse to reject the truth closed their ears to this\r\nexplanation; and the words, “No man knoweth the day nor the hour,”\r\ncontinued to be echoed by the bold scoffer, and even by the professed\r\nminister of Christ. As the people were roused, and began to inquire the\r\nway of salvation, religious teachers stepped in between them and the\r\ntruth, seeking to quiet their fears by falsely interpreting the word of\r\nGod. Unfaithful watchmen united in the work of the great deceiver, crying,\r\nPeace, peace, when God had not spoken peace. Like the Pharisees in\r\nChrist’s day, many refused to enter the kingdom of heaven themselves, and\r\nthose who were entering in, they hindered. The blood of these souls will\r\nbe required at their hand.\r\n\r\nThe most humble and devoted in the churches were usually the first to\r\nreceive the message. Those who studied the Bible for themselves could not\r\nbut see the unscriptural character of the popular views of prophecy; and\r\nwherever the people were not controlled by the influence of the clergy,\r\nwherever they would search the word of God for themselves, the advent\r\ndoctrine needed only to be compared with the Scriptures to establish its\r\ndivine authority.\r\n\r\nMany were persecuted by their unbelieving brethren. In order to retain\r\ntheir position in the church, some consented to be silent in regard to\r\ntheir hope; but others felt that loyalty to God forbade them thus to hide\r\nthe truths which He had committed to their trust. Not a few were cut off\r\nfrom the fellowship of the church for no other reason than expressing\r\ntheir belief in the coming of Christ. Very precious to those who bore this\r\ntrial of their faith were the words of the prophet, “Your brethren that\r\nhated you, that cast you out for My name’s sake, said, Let the Lord be\r\nglorified: but He shall appear to your joy, and they shall be\r\nashamed.”(615)\r\n\r\nAngels of God were watching with the deepest interest the result of the\r\nwarning. When there was a general rejection of the message by the\r\nchurches, angels turned away in sadness. But there were many who had not\r\nyet been tested in regard to the advent truth. Many were misled by\r\nhusbands, wives, parents, or children, and were made to believe it a sin\r\neven to listen to such heresies as were taught by the Adventists. Angels\r\nwere bidden to keep faithful watch over these souls; for another light was\r\nyet to shine upon them from the throne of God.\r\n\r\nWith unspeakable desire those who had received the message watched for the\r\ncoming of their Saviour. The time when they expected to meet Him was at\r\nhand. They approached this hour with a calm solemnity. They rested in\r\nsweet communion with God, an earnest of the peace that was to be theirs in\r\nthe bright hereafter. None who experienced this hope and trust can forget\r\nthose precious hours of waiting. For some weeks preceding the time,\r\nworldly business was for the most part laid aside. The sincere believers\r\ncarefully examined every thought and emotion of their hearts as if upon\r\ntheir death-beds and in a few hours to close their eyes upon earthly\r\nscenes. There was no making of “ascension robes;”(616) but all felt the\r\nneed of internal evidence that they were prepared to meet the Saviour;\r\ntheir white robes were purity of soul,—characters cleansed from sin by the\r\natoning blood of Christ. Would that there was still with the professed\r\npeople of God the same spirit of heart-searching, the same earnest,\r\ndetermined faith. Had they continued thus to humble themselves before the\r\nLord, and press their petitions at the mercy-seat, they would be in\r\npossession of a far richer experience than they now have. There is too\r\nlittle prayer, too little real conviction of sin, and the lack of living\r\nfaith leaves many destitute of the grace so richly provided by our\r\nRedeemer.\r\n\r\nGod designed to prove His people. His hand covered a mistake in the\r\nreckoning of the prophetic periods. Adventists did not discover the error,\r\nnor was it discovered by the most learned of their opponents. The latter\r\nsaid: “Your reckoning of the prophetic periods is correct. Some great\r\nevent is about to take place; but it is not what Mr. Miller predicts; it\r\nis the conversion of the world, and not the second advent of Christ.”(617)\r\n\r\nThe time of expectation passed, and Christ did not appear for the\r\ndeliverance of His people. Those who with sincere faith and love had\r\nlooked for their Saviour, experienced a bitter disappointment. Yet the\r\npurposes of God were being accomplished: He was testing the hearts of\r\nthose who professed to be waiting for His appearing. There were among them\r\nmany who had been actuated by no higher motive than fear. Their profession\r\nof faith had not affected their hearts or their lives. When the expected\r\nevent failed to take place, these persons declared that they were not\r\ndisappointed; they had never believed that Christ would come. They were\r\namong the first to ridicule the sorrow of the true believers.\r\n\r\nBut Jesus and all the heavenly host looked with love and sympathy upon the\r\ntried and faithful yet disappointed ones. Could the veil separating the\r\nvisible from the invisible world have been swept back, angels would have\r\nbeen seen drawing near to these steadfast souls, and shielding them from\r\nthe shafts of Satan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21. A WARNING REJECTED.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nIn preaching the doctrine of the second advent, William Miller and his\r\nassociates had labored with the sole purpose of arousing men to a\r\npreparation for the judgment. They had sought to awaken professors of\r\nreligion to the true hope of the church, and to their need of a deeper\r\nChristian experience; and they labored also to awaken the unconverted to\r\nthe duty of immediate repentance and conversion to God. “They made no\r\nattempt to convert men to a sect or party in religion. Hence they labored\r\namong all parties and sects, without interfering with their organization\r\nor discipline.”(618)\r\n\r\n“In all my labors,” said Miller, “I never had the desire or thought to\r\nestablish any separate interest from that of existing denominations, or to\r\nbenefit one at the expense of another. I thought to benefit all. Supposing\r\nthat all Christians would rejoice in the prospect of Christ’s coming, and\r\nthat those who could not see as I did would not love any the less those\r\nwho should embrace this doctrine, I did not conceive there would ever be\r\nany necessity for separate meetings. My whole object was a desire to\r\nconvert souls to God, to notify the world of a coming judgment, and to\r\ninduce my fellow-men to make that preparation of heart which will enable\r\nthem to meet their God in peace. The great majority of those who were\r\nconverted under my labors united with the various existing churches.”(619)\r\n\r\nAs his work tended to build up the churches, it was for a time regarded\r\nwith favor. But as ministers and religious leaders decided against the\r\nadvent doctrine, and desired to suppress all agitation of the subject,\r\nthey not only opposed it from the pulpit, but denied their members the\r\nprivilege of attending preaching upon the second advent, or even of\r\nspeaking of their hope in the social meetings of the church. Thus the\r\nbelievers found themselves in a position of great trial and perplexity.\r\nThey loved their churches, and were loath to separate from them; but as\r\nthey saw the testimony of God’s word suppressed, and their right to\r\ninvestigate the prophecies denied, they felt that loyalty to God forbade\r\nthem to submit. Those who sought to shut out the testimony of God’s word,\r\nthey could not regard as constituting the church of Christ, “the pillar\r\nand ground of the truth.” Hence they felt themselves justified in\r\nseparating from their former connection. In the summer of 1844 about fifty\r\nthousand withdrew from the churches.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a marked change was apparent in most of the churches\r\nthroughout the United States. There had been for many years a gradual but\r\nsteadily increasing conformity to worldly practices and customs, and a\r\ncorresponding decline in real spiritual life; but in that year there were\r\nevidences of a sudden and marked declension in nearly all the churches of\r\nthe land. While none seemed able to suggest the cause, the fact itself was\r\nwidely noted and commented upon, by both the press and the pulpit.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the presbytery of Philadelphia, Mr. Barnes, author of a\r\ncommentary widely used, and pastor of one of the leading churches in that\r\ncity, “stated that he had been in the ministry for twenty years, and\r\nnever, till the last communion, had he administered the ordinance without\r\nreceiving more or less into the church. But now there are _no awakenings,\r\nno conversions_, not much apparent growth in grace in professors, and none\r\ncome to his study to converse about the salvation of their souls. With the\r\nincrease of business, and the brightening prospects of commerce and\r\nmanufacture, there is an increase of worldly-mindedness. _Thus it is with\r\nall the denominations._”(620)\r\n\r\nIn the month of February of the same year, Professor Finney, of Oberlin\r\nCollege, said: “We have had the fact before our minds, that, in general,\r\nthe Protestant churches of our country, as such, were either apathetic or\r\nhostile to nearly all the moral reforms of the age. There are partial\r\nexceptions, yet not enough to render the fact otherwise than general. We\r\nhave also another corroborated fact: the almost universal absence of\r\nrevival influence in the churches. The spiritual apathy is almost\r\nall-pervading, and is fearfully deep; so the religious press of the whole\r\nland testifies.... Very extensively, church-members are becoming devotees\r\nof fashion,—join hands with the ungodly in parties of pleasure, in\r\ndancing, in festivities, etc.... But we need not expand this painful\r\nsubject. Suffice it that the evidence thickens and rolls heavily upon us,\r\nto show that the _churches generally are becoming sadly degenerate_. They\r\nhave gone very far from the Lord, and He has withdrawn Himself from them.”\r\n\r\nAnd a writer in the _Religious Telescope_ testified: “We have never\r\nwitnessed such a general declension of religion as at the present. Truly,\r\nthe church should awake, and search into the cause of this affliction; for\r\nas an affliction every one that loves Zion must view it. When we call to\r\nmind how ‘few and far between’ cases of true conversion are, and the\r\nalmost unparalleled impertinence and hardness of sinners, we almost\r\ninvoluntarily exclaim, ‘Has God forgotten to be gracious? or, Is the door\r\nof mercy closed?’ ”\r\n\r\nSuch a condition never exists without cause in the church itself. The\r\nspiritual darkness which falls upon nations, upon churches and\r\nindividuals, is due, not to an arbitrary withdrawal of the succors of\r\ndivine grace on the part of God, but to neglect or rejection of divine\r\nlight on the part of men. A striking illustration of this truth is\r\npresented in the history of the Jewish people in the time of Christ. By\r\ntheir devotion to the world and forgetfulness of God and His word, their\r\nunderstanding had become darkened, their hearts earthly and sensual. Thus\r\nthey were in ignorance concerning Messiah’s advent, and in their pride and\r\nunbelief they rejected the Redeemer. God did not even then cut off the\r\nJewish nation from a knowledge of, or a participation in, the blessings of\r\nsalvation. But those who rejected the truth lost all desire for the gift\r\nof Heaven. They had “put darkness for light, and light for darkness,”\r\nuntil the light which was in them became darkness; and how great was that\r\ndarkness!\r\n\r\nIt suits the policy of Satan, that men should retain the forms of\r\nreligion, if but the spirit of vital godliness is lacking. After their\r\nrejection of the gospel, the Jews continued zealously to maintain their\r\nancient rites, they rigorously preserved their national exclusiveness,\r\nwhile they themselves could not but admit that the presence of God was no\r\nlonger manifest among them. The prophecy of Daniel pointed so unmistakably\r\nto the time of Messiah’s coming, and so directly foretold His death, that\r\nthey discouraged its study, and finally the rabbis pronounced a curse on\r\nall who should attempt a computation of the time. In blindness and\r\nimpenitence, the people of Israel for eighteen hundred years have stood,\r\nindifferent to the gracious offers of salvation, unmindful of the\r\nblessings of the gospel, a solemn and fearful warning of the danger of\r\nrejecting light from heaven.\r\n\r\nWherever the cause exists, the same results will follow. He who\r\ndeliberately stifles his convictions of duty because it interferes with\r\nhis inclinations, will finally lose the power to distinguish between truth\r\nand error. The understanding becomes darkened, the conscience callous, the\r\nheart hardened, and the soul is separated from God. Where the message of\r\ndivine truth is spurned or slighted, there the church will be enshrouded\r\nin darkness; faith and love grow cold, and estrangement and dissension\r\nenter. Church-members center their interests and energies in worldly\r\npursuits, and sinners become hardened in their impenitence.\r\n\r\nThe first angel’s message of Revelation 14, announcing the hour of God’s\r\njudgment, and calling upon men to fear and worship Him, was designed to\r\nseparate the professed people of God from the corrupting influences of the\r\nworld, and to arouse them to see their true condition of worldliness and\r\nbacksliding. In this message, God had sent to the church a warning, which,\r\nhad it been accepted, would have corrected the evils that were shutting\r\nthem away from Him. Had they received the message from heaven, humbling\r\ntheir hearts before the Lord, and seeking in sincerity a preparation to\r\nstand in His presence, the Spirit and power of God would have been\r\nmanifested among them. The church would again have reached that blessed\r\nstate of unity, faith, and love, which existed in apostolic days, when the\r\nbelievers “were of one heart and of one soul,” and “spake the word of God\r\nwith boldness,” when “the Lord added to the church daily such as should be\r\nsaved.”(621)\r\n\r\nIf God’s professed people would receive the light as it shines upon them\r\nfrom His word, they would reach that unity for which Christ prayed, that\r\nwhich the apostle describes, “the unity of the Spirit in the bond of\r\npeace.” “There is,” he says, “_one_ body, and _one_ Spirit, even as ye are\r\ncalled in _one_ hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one\r\nbaptism.”(622)\r\n\r\nSuch were the blessed results experienced by those who accepted the advent\r\nmessage. They came from different denominations, and their denominational\r\nbarriers were hurled to the ground; conflicting creeds were shivered to\r\natoms; the unscriptural hope of a temporal millennium was abandoned, false\r\nviews of the second advent were corrected, pride and conformity to the\r\nworld were swept away; wrongs were made right; hearts were united in the\r\nsweetest fellowship, and love and joy reigned supreme. If this doctrine\r\ndid this for the few who did receive it, it would have done the same for\r\nall, if all had received it.\r\n\r\nBut the churches generally did not accept the warning. Their ministers,\r\nwho, as “watchmen unto the house of Israel,” should have been the first to\r\ndiscern the tokens of Jesus’ coming, had failed to learn the truth, either\r\nfrom the testimony of the prophets or from the signs of the times. As\r\nworldly hopes and ambitions filled the heart, love for God and faith in\r\nHis word had grown cold; and when the advent doctrine was presented, it\r\nonly aroused their prejudice and unbelief. The fact that the message was,\r\nto a great extent, preached by laymen, was urged as an argument against\r\nit. As of old, the plain testimony of God’s word was met with the inquiry,\r\n“Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed?” And finding how\r\ndifficult a task it was to refute the arguments drawn from the prophetic\r\nperiods, many discouraged the study of the prophecies, teaching that the\r\nprophetic books were sealed, and were not to be understood. Multitudes,\r\ntrusting implicitly to their pastors, refused to listen to the warning;\r\nand others, though convinced of the truth, dared not confess it, lest they\r\nshould be “put out of the synagogue.” The message which God had sent for\r\nthe testing and purification of the church, revealed all too surely how\r\ngreat was the number who had set their affections on this world rather\r\nthan upon Christ. The ties which bound them to earth were stronger than\r\nthe attractions heavenward. They chose to listen to the voice of worldly\r\nwisdom, and turned away from the heart-searching message of truth.\r\n\r\nIn refusing the warning of the first angel, they rejected the means which\r\nHeaven had provided for their restoration. They spurned the gracious\r\nmessenger that would have corrected the evils which separated them from\r\nGod, and with greater eagerness they turned to seek the friendship of the\r\nworld. Here was the cause of that fearful condition of worldliness,\r\nbacksliding, and spiritual death which existed in the churches in 1844.\r\n\r\nIn Revelation 14, the first angel is followed by a second, proclaiming,\r\n“Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all\r\nnations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.”(623) The term\r\n“Babylon” is derived from “Babel,” and signifies confusion. It is employed\r\nin Scripture to designate the various forms of false or apostate religion.\r\nIn Revelation 17, Babylon is represented as a woman,—a figure which is\r\nused in the Bible as the symbol of a church, a virtuous woman representing\r\na pure church, a vile woman an apostate church.\r\n\r\nIn the Bible the sacred and enduring character of the relation that exists\r\nbetween Christ and His church is represented by the union of marriage. The\r\nLord has joined His people to Himself by a solemn covenant, He promising\r\nto be their God, and they pledging themselves to be His, and His alone. He\r\ndeclares, “I will betroth thee unto Me forever; yea, I will betroth thee\r\nunto Me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in\r\nmercies.”(624) And again, “I am married unto you.”(625) And Paul employs\r\nthe same figure in the New Testament when he says, “I have espoused you to\r\none husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.”(626)\r\n\r\nThe unfaithfulness of the church to Christ in permitting her confidence\r\nand affection to be turned from Him, and allowing the love of worldly\r\nthings to occupy the soul, is likened to the violation of the marriage\r\nvow. The sin of Israel in departing from the Lord is presented under this\r\nfigure; and the wonderful love of God which they thus despised is\r\ntouchingly portrayed: “I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with\r\nthee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest Mine.” “And thou wast\r\nexceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom. And thy renown\r\nwent forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through My\r\ncomeliness, which I had put upon thee.... But thou didst trust in thine\r\nown beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown.” “As a wife\r\ntreacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously\r\nwith Me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord;” “as a wife that committeth\r\nadultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband.”(627)\r\n\r\nIn the New Testament, language very similar is addressed to professed\r\nChristians who seek the friendship of the world above the favor of God.\r\nSays the apostle James: “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that\r\nthe friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will\r\nbe a friend of the world is the enemy of God.”\r\n\r\nThe woman (Babylon) of Revelation 17, is described as “arrayed in purple\r\nand scarlet color, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls,\r\nhaving a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness: ...\r\nand upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery, Babylon the Great, the\r\nmother of harlots.” Says the prophet, “I saw the woman drunken with the\r\nblood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.” Babylon\r\nis further declared to be “that great city, which reigneth over the kings\r\nof the earth.”(628) The power that for so many centuries maintained\r\ndespotic sway over the monarchs of Christendom, is Rome. The purple and\r\nscarlet color, the gold and precious stones and pearls, vividly picture\r\nthe magnificence and more than kingly pomp affected by the haughty see of\r\nRome. And no other power could be so truly declared “drunken with the\r\nblood of the saints” as that church which has so cruelly persecuted the\r\nfollowers of Christ. Babylon is also charged with the sin of unlawful\r\nconnection with “the kings of the earth.” It was by departure from the\r\nLord, and alliance with the heathen, that the Jewish church became a\r\nharlot; and Rome, corrupting herself in like manner by seeking the support\r\nof worldly powers, receives a like condemnation.\r\n\r\nBabylon is said to be “the _mother_ of harlots.” By her _daughters_ must\r\nbe symbolized churches that cling to her doctrines and traditions, and\r\nfollow her example of sacrificing the truth and the approval of God, in\r\norder to form an unlawful alliance with the world. The message of\r\nRevelation 14, announcing the _fall_ of Babylon, must apply to religious\r\nbodies that were once pure and have become corrupt. Since this message\r\nfollows the warning of the judgment, it must be given in the last days;\r\ntherefore it cannot refer to the Roman Church alone, for that church has\r\nbeen in a fallen condition for many centuries. Furthermore, in the\r\neighteenth chapter of the Revelation, the people of God are called upon to\r\ncome out of Babylon. According to this scripture, many of God’s people\r\nmust still be in Babylon. And in what religious bodies are the greater\r\npart of the followers of Christ now to be found? Without doubt, in the\r\nvarious churches professing the Protestant faith. At the time of their\r\nrise, these churches took a noble stand for God and the truth, and His\r\nblessing was with them. Even the unbelieving world was constrained to\r\nacknowledge the beneficent results that followed an acceptance of the\r\nprinciples of the gospel. In the words of the prophet to Israel, “Thy\r\nrenown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect\r\nthrough My comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord\r\nGod.”(629) But they fell by the same desire which was the curse and ruin\r\nof Israel,—the desire of imitating the practices and courting the\r\nfriendship of the ungodly. “Thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and\r\nplayedst the harlot because of thy renown.”(630)\r\n\r\nMany of the Protestant churches are following Rome’s example of iniquitous\r\nconnection with “the kings of the earth”—the state churches, by their\r\nrelation to secular governments; and other denominations, by seeking the\r\nfavor of the world. And the term “Babylon”—confusion—may be appropriately\r\napplied to these bodies, all professing to derive their doctrines from the\r\nBible, yet divided into almost innumerable sects, with widely conflicting\r\ncreeds and theories.\r\n\r\nBesides a sinful union with the world, the churches that separated from\r\nRome present other of her characteristics. A Roman Catholic work argues\r\nthat “if the Church of Rome were ever guilty of idolatry in relation to\r\nthe saints, her daughter, the Church of England, stands guilty of the\r\nsame, which has ten churches dedicated to Mary for one dedicated to\r\nChrist.”(631)\r\n\r\nAnd Dr. Hopkins, in “A Treatise on the Millennium,” declares: “There is no\r\nreason to consider the antichristian spirit and practices to be confined\r\nto that which is now called the Church of Rome. The Protestant churches\r\nhave much of antichrist in them, and are far from being wholly reformed\r\nfrom ... corruptions and wickedness.”(632)\r\n\r\nConcerning the separation of the Presbyterian Church from Rome, Dr.\r\nGuthrie writes: “Three hundred years ago, our church, with an open Bible\r\non her banner, and this motto, ‘Search the Scriptures,’ on her scroll,\r\nmarched out from the gates of Rome.” Then he asks the significant\r\nquestion, “Did they come _clean_ out of Babylon?”(633)\r\n\r\n“The Church of England,” says Spurgeon, “seems to be eaten through and\r\nthrough with sacramentarianism; but non-conformity appears to be almost as\r\nbadly riddled with philosophical infidelity. Those of whom we thought\r\nbetter things are turning aside one by one from the fundamentals of the\r\nfaith. Through and through, I believe, the very heart of England is\r\nhoneycombed with a damnable infidelity which dares still go into the\r\npulpit and call itself Christian.”\r\n\r\nWhat was the origin of the great apostasy? How did the church first depart\r\nfrom the simplicity of the gospel? By conforming to the practices of\r\npaganism, to facilitate the acceptance of Christianity by the heathen. The\r\napostle Paul declared, even in his day, “The mystery of iniquity doth\r\nalready work.”(634) During the lives of the apostles the church remained\r\ncomparatively pure. But “toward the latter end of the second century most\r\nof the churches assumed a new form; the first simplicity disappeared, and\r\ninsensibly, as the old disciples retired to their graves, their children,\r\nalong with new converts, ... came forward and new-modeled the cause.”(635)\r\nTo secure converts, the exalted standard of the Christian faith was\r\nlowered, and as the result “a pagan flood, flowing into the church,\r\ncarried with it its customs, practices, and idols.”(636) As the Christian\r\nreligion secured the favor and support of secular rulers, it was nominally\r\naccepted by multitudes; but while in appearance Christians, many “remained\r\nin substance pagans, especially worshiping in secret their idols.”(637)\r\n\r\nHas not the same process been repeated in nearly every church calling\r\nitself Protestant? As its founders, those who possessed the true spirit of\r\nreform, pass away, their descendants come forward and “new-model the\r\ncause.” While blindly clinging to the creed of their fathers and refusing\r\nto accept any truth in advance of what they saw, the children of the\r\nreformers depart widely from their example of humility, self-denial, and\r\nrenunciation of the world. Thus “the first simplicity disappears.” A\r\nworldly flood, flowing into the church, “carries with it its customs,\r\npractices, and idols.”\r\n\r\nAlas, to what a fearful extent is that friendship of the world which is\r\n“enmity with God,” now cherished among the professed followers of Christ!\r\nHow widely have the popular churches throughout Christendom departed from\r\nthe Bible standard of humility, self-denial, simplicity, and godliness!\r\nSaid John Wesley, in speaking of the right use of money: “Do not waste any\r\npart of so precious a talent, merely in gratifying the desire of the eye,\r\nby superfluous or expensive apparel, or by needless ornaments. Waste no\r\npart of it in curiously adorning your houses; in superfluous or expensive\r\nfurniture; in costly pictures, painting, gilding.... Lay out nothing to\r\ngratify the pride of life, to gain the admiration or praise of men.... ‘So\r\nlong as thou doest well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee.’ So\r\nlong as thou art ‘clothed in purple and fine linen, and farest sumptuously\r\nevery day,’ no doubt many will applaud thy elegance of taste, thy\r\ngenerosity and hospitality. But do not buy their applause so dear. Rather\r\nbe content with the honor that cometh from God.”(638) But in many churches\r\nof our time, such teaching is disregarded.\r\n\r\nA profession of religion has become popular with the world. Rulers,\r\npoliticians, lawyers, doctors, merchants, join the church as a means of\r\nsecuring the respect and confidence of society, and advancing their own\r\nworldly interests. Thus they seek to cover all their unrighteous\r\ntransactions under a profession of Christianity. The various religious\r\nbodies, re-enforced by the wealth and influence of these baptized\r\nworldlings, make a still higher bid for popularity and patronage. Splendid\r\nchurches, embellished in the most extravagant manner, are erected on\r\npopular avenues. The worshipers array themselves in costly and fashionable\r\nattire. A high salary is paid for a talented minister to entertain and\r\nattract the people. His sermons must not touch popular sins, but be made\r\nsmooth and pleasing for fashionable ears. Thus fashionable sinners are\r\nenrolled on the church-records, and fashionable sins are concealed under a\r\npretense of godliness.\r\n\r\nCommenting on the present attitude of professed Christians toward the\r\nworld, a leading secular journal says: “Insensibly the church has yielded\r\nto the spirit of the age, and adapted its forms of worship to modern\r\nwants.” “All things, indeed, that help to make religion attractive, the\r\nchurch now employs as its instruments.” And a writer in the New York\r\n_Independent_ speaks thus concerning Methodism as it is: “The line of\r\nseparation between the godly and the irreligious fades out into a kind of\r\npenumbra, and zealous men on both sides are toiling to obliterate all\r\ndifference between their modes of action and enjoyment.” “The popularity\r\nof religion tends vastly to increase the number of those who would secure\r\nits benefits without squarely meeting its duties.”\r\n\r\nSays Howard Crosby: “It is a matter of deep concern that we find Christ’s\r\nchurch so little fulfilling the designs of its Lord. Just as the ancient\r\nJews let a familiar intercourse with the idolatrous nations steal away\r\ntheir hearts from God, ... so the church of Jesus now is, by its false\r\npartnerships with an unbelieving world, giving up the divine methods of\r\nits true life, and yielding itself to the pernicious, though often\r\nplausible, habits of a Christless society, using the arguments and\r\nreaching the conclusions which are foreign to the revelation of God, and\r\ndirectly antagonistic to all growth in grace.”(639)\r\n\r\nIn this tide of worldliness and pleasure-seeking, self-denial and\r\nself-sacrifice for Christ’s sake are almost wholly lost. “Some of the men\r\nand women now in active life in our churches were educated, when children,\r\nto make sacrifices in order to be able to give or do something for\r\nChrist.” But “if funds are wanted now, ... nobody must be called on to\r\ngive. Oh, no! have a fair, tableaux, mock trial, antiquarian supper, or\r\nsomething to eat—anything to amuse the people.”\r\n\r\nGovernor Washburn, of Wisconsin, in his annual message, Jan. 9, 1873,\r\ndeclared: “Some law seems to be required to break up the schools where\r\ngamblers are made. These are everywhere. Even the church (unwittingly, no\r\ndoubt) is sometimes found doing the work of the devil. Gift concerts, gift\r\nenterprises and raffles, sometimes in aid of religious or charitable\r\nobjects, but often for less worthy purposes, lotteries, prize packages,\r\netc., are all devices to obtain money without value received. Nothing is\r\nso demoralizing or intoxicating, particularly to the young, as the\r\nacquisition of money or property without labor. Respectable people\r\nengaging in these chance enterprises, and easing their consciences with\r\nthe reflection that the money is to go to a good object, it is not strange\r\nthat the youth of the State should so often fall into the habits which the\r\nexcitement of games of hazard is almost certain to engender.”\r\n\r\nThe spirit of worldly conformity is invading the churches throughout\r\nChristendom. Robert Atkins, in a sermon preached in London, draws a dark\r\npicture of the spiritual declension that prevails in England: “The truly\r\nrighteous are diminished from the earth, and no man layeth it to heart.\r\nThe professors of religion of the present day, in every church, are lovers\r\nof the world, conformers to the world, lovers of creature comfort, and\r\naspirers after respectability. They are called to suffer with Christ, but\r\nthey shrink from even reproach.... _apostasy, apostasy, apostasy_, is\r\nengraven on the very front of every church; and did they know it, and did\r\nthey feel it, there might be hope; but, alas! they cry, ‘We are rich, and\r\nincreased in goods, and stand in need of nothing.’ ”(640)\r\n\r\nThe great sin charged against Babylon is, that she “made all nations drink\r\nof the wine of the wrath of her fornication.” This cup of intoxication\r\nwhich she presents to the world, represents the false doctrines that she\r\nhas accepted as the result of her unlawful connection with the great ones\r\nof the earth. Friendship with the world corrupts her faith, and in her\r\nturn she exerts a corrupting influence upon the world by teaching\r\ndoctrines which are opposed to the plainest statements of Holy Writ.\r\n\r\nRome withheld the Bible from the people, and required all men to accept\r\nher teachings in its place. It was the work of the Reformation to restore\r\nto men the word of God; but is it not too true that in the churches of our\r\ntime men are taught to rest their faith upon their creed and the teachings\r\nof their church rather than on the Scriptures? Said Charles Beecher,\r\nspeaking of the Protestant churches: “They shrink from any rude word\r\nagainst creeds with the same sensitiveness with which those holy fathers\r\nwould have shrunk from a rude word against the rising veneration of saints\r\nand martyrs which they were fostering.... The Protestant evangelical\r\ndenominations have so tied up one another’s hands, and their own, that,\r\nbetween them all, a man cannot become a preacher at all, anywhere, without\r\naccepting some book besides the Bible.... There is nothing imaginary in\r\nthe statement that the creed power is now beginning to prohibit the Bible\r\nas really as Rome did, though in a subtler way.”(641)\r\n\r\nWhen faithful teachers expound the word of God, there arise men of\r\nlearning, ministers professing to understand the Scriptures, who denounce\r\nsound doctrine as heresy, and thus turn away inquirers after truth. Were\r\nit not that the world is hopelessly intoxicated with the wine of Babylon,\r\nmultitudes would be convicted and converted by the plain, cutting truths\r\nof the word of God. But religious faith appears so confused and\r\ndiscordant, that the people know not what to believe as truth. The sin of\r\nthe world’s impenitence lies at the door of the church.\r\n\r\nThe second angel’s message of Revelation 14 was first preached in the\r\nsummer of 1844, and it then had a more direct application to the churches\r\nof the United States, where the warning of the judgment had been most\r\nwidely proclaimed and most generally rejected, and where the declension in\r\nthe churches had been most rapid. But the message of the second angel did\r\nnot reach its complete fulfilment in 1844. The churches then experienced a\r\nmoral fall, in consequence of their refusal of the light of the advent\r\nmessage; but that fall was not complete. As they have continued to reject\r\nthe special truths for this time, they have fallen lower and lower. Not\r\nyet, however, can it be said that “Babylon is fallen, ... because she made\r\n_all nations_ drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.” She has\r\nnot yet made all nations do this. The spirit of world-conforming and\r\nindifference to the testing truths for our time, exists and has been\r\ngaining ground in churches of the Protestant faith in all the countries of\r\nChristendom; and these churches are included in the solemn and terrible\r\ndenunciation of the second angel. But the work of apostasy has not yet\r\nreached its culmination.\r\n\r\nThe Bible declares that before the coming of the Lord, Satan will work\r\n“with _all_ power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness\r\nof unrighteousness;” and they that “received not the love of the truth,\r\nthat they might be saved,” will be left to receive “strong delusion, that\r\nthey should believe a lie.”(642) Not until this condition shall be\r\nreached, and the union of the church with the world shall be fully\r\naccomplished throughout Christendom, will the fall of Babylon be complete.\r\nThe change is a progressive one, and the perfect fulfilment of Rev. 14:8\r\nis yet future.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the spiritual darkness and alienation from God that exist\r\nin the churches which constitute Babylon, the great body of Christ’s true\r\nfollowers are still to be found in their communion. There are many of\r\nthese who have never seen the special truths for this time. Not a few are\r\ndissatisfied with their present condition, and are longing for clearer\r\nlight. They look in vain for the image of Christ in the churches with\r\nwhich they are connected. As these bodies depart farther and farther from\r\nthe truth, and ally themselves more closely with the world, the difference\r\nbetween the two classes will widen, and it will finally result in\r\nseparation. The time will come when those who love God supremely can no\r\nlonger remain in connection with such as are “lovers of pleasures more\r\nthan lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power\r\nthereof.”\r\n\r\nRevelation 18 points to the time when, as the result of rejecting the\r\nthreefold warning of Rev. 14:6-12, the church will have fully reached the\r\ncondition foretold by the second angel, and the people of God still in\r\nBabylon will be called upon to separate from her communion. This message\r\nis the last that will ever be given to the world; and it will accomplish\r\nits work. When those that “believed not the truth, but had pleasure in\r\nunrighteousness,”(643) shall be left to receive strong delusion and to\r\nbelieve a lie, then the light of truth will shine upon all whose hearts\r\nare open to receive it, and all the children of the Lord that remain in\r\nBabylon will heed the call, “Come out of her, My people.”(644)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22. PROPHECIES FULFILLED.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nWhen the time passed at which the Lord’s coming was first expected,—in the\r\nspring of 1844,—those who had looked in faith for His appearing were for a\r\nseason involved in doubt and uncertainty. While the world regarded them as\r\nhaving been utterly defeated, and proved to have been cherishing a\r\ndelusion, their source of consolation was still the word of God. Many\r\ncontinued to search the Scriptures, examining anew the evidences of their\r\nfaith, and carefully studying the prophecies to obtain further light. The\r\nBible testimony in support of their position seemed clear and conclusive.\r\nSigns which could not be mistaken pointed to the coming of Christ as near.\r\nThe special blessing of the Lord, both in the conversion of sinners and\r\nthe revival of spiritual life among Christians, had testified that the\r\nmessage was of Heaven. And though the believers could not explain their\r\ndisappointment, they felt assured that God had led them in their past\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nInterwoven with prophecies which they had regarded as applying to the time\r\nof the second advent, was instruction specially adapted to their state of\r\nuncertainty and suspense, and encouraging them to wait patiently in the\r\nfaith that what was now dark to their understanding would in due time be\r\nmade plain.\r\n\r\nAmong these prophecies was that of Hab. 2:1-4: “I will stand upon my\r\nwatch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what He will say\r\nunto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved. And the Lord answered\r\nme, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may\r\nrun that readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at\r\nthe end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because\r\nit will surely come, it will not tarry. Behold, his soul which is lifted\r\nup is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.”\r\n\r\nAs early as 1842, the direction given in this prophecy, to “write the\r\nvision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it,”\r\nhad suggested to Charles Fitch the preparation of a prophetic chart to\r\nillustrate the visions of Daniel and the Revelation. The publication of\r\nthis chart was regarded as a fulfilment of the command given by Habakkuk.\r\nNo one, however, then noticed that an apparent delay in the accomplishment\r\nof the vision—a tarrying time—is presented in the same prophecy. After the\r\ndisappointment, this scripture appeared very significant: “The vision is\r\nyet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie:\r\nthough it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not\r\ntarry.... The just shall live by his _faith_.”\r\n\r\nA portion of Ezekiel’s prophecy also was a source of strength and comfort\r\nto believers: “The word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, what\r\nis that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are\r\nprolonged, and every vision faileth? Tell them therefore, Thus saith the\r\nLord God, ... The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.... I\r\nwill speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall\r\nbe no more prolonged.” “They of the house of Israel say, The vision that\r\nhe seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times that\r\nare far off. Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God: There shall\r\nnone of My words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken\r\nshall be done.”(645)\r\n\r\nThe waiting ones rejoiced, believing that He who knows the end from the\r\nbeginning had looked down through the ages, and foreseeing their\r\ndisappointment, had given them words of courage and hope. Had it not been\r\nfor such portions of Scripture, admonishing them to wait with patience,\r\nand to hold fast their confidence in God’s word, their faith would have\r\nfailed in that trying hour.\r\n\r\nThe parable of the ten virgins of Matthew 25 also illustrates the\r\nexperience of the Adventist people. In Matthew 24, in answer to the\r\nquestion of His disciples concerning the sign of His coming and of the end\r\nof the world, Christ had pointed out some of the most important events in\r\nthe history of the world and of the church from His first to His second\r\nadvent; namely, the destruction of Jerusalem, the great tribulation of the\r\nchurch under the pagan and papal persecutions, the darkening of the sun\r\nand moon, and the falling of the stars. After this He spoke of His coming\r\nin His kingdom, and related the parable describing the two classes of\r\nservants who look for His appearing. Chapter 25 opens with the words,\r\n“_Then_ shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins.” Here is\r\nbrought to view the church living in the last days, the same that is\r\npointed out in the close of chapter 24. In this parable their experience\r\nis illustrated by the incidents of an Eastern marriage.\r\n\r\n“Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took\r\ntheir lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. And five of them were\r\nwise, and five were foolish. They that were foolish took their lamps, and\r\ntook no oil with them: but the wise took oil in their vessels with their\r\nlamps. While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. And at\r\nmidnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to\r\nmeet him.”\r\n\r\nThe coming of Christ, as announced by the first angel’s message, was\r\nunderstood to be represented by the coming of the bridegroom. The\r\nwide-spread reformation under the proclamation of His soon coming,\r\nanswered to the going forth of the virgins. In this parable, as in that of\r\nMatthew 24, two classes are represented. All had taken their lamps, the\r\nBible, and by its light had gone forth to meet the Bridegroom. But while\r\n“they that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them,” “the\r\nwise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.” The latter class had\r\nreceived the grace of God, the regenerating, enlightening power of the\r\nHoly Spirit, which renders His word a lamp to the feet and a light to the\r\npath. In the fear of God they had studied the Scriptures to learn the\r\ntruth, and had earnestly sought for purity of heart and life. These had a\r\npersonal experience, a faith in God and in His word, which could not be\r\noverthrown by disappointment and delay. Others “took their lamps, and took\r\nno oil with them.” They had moved from impulse. Their fears had been\r\nexcited by the solemn message, but they had depended upon the faith of\r\ntheir brethren, satisfied with the flickering light of good emotions,\r\nwithout a thorough understanding of the truth, or a genuine work of grace\r\nin the heart. These had gone forth to meet the Lord, full of hope in the\r\nprospect of immediate reward; but they were not prepared for delay and\r\ndisappointment. When trials came, their faith failed, and their lights\r\nburned dim.\r\n\r\n“While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.” By the\r\ntarrying of the bridegroom is represented the passing of the time when the\r\nLord was expected, the disappointment, and the seeming delay. In this time\r\nof uncertainty, the interest of the superficial and half-hearted soon\r\nbegan to waver, and their efforts to relax; but those whose faith was\r\nbased on a personal knowledge of the Bible, had a rock beneath their feet,\r\nwhich the waves of disappointment could not wash away. “They all slumbered\r\nand slept;” one class in unconcern and abandonment of their faith, the\r\nother class patiently waiting till clearer light should be given. Yet in\r\nthe night of trial the latter seemed to lose, to some extent, their zeal\r\nand devotion. The half-hearted and superficial could no longer lean upon\r\nthe faith of their brethren. Each must stand or fall for himself.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, fanaticism began to appear. Some who had professed to be\r\nzealous believers in the message, rejected the word of God as the one\r\ninfallible guide, and claiming to be led by the Spirit, gave themselves up\r\nto the control of their own feelings, impressions, and imaginations. There\r\nwere some who manifested a blind and bigoted zeal, denouncing all who\r\nwould not sanction their course. Their fanatical ideas and exercises met\r\nwith no sympathy from the great body of Adventists; yet they served to\r\nbring reproach upon the cause of truth.\r\n\r\nSatan was seeking by this means to oppose and destroy the work of God. The\r\npeople had been greatly stirred by the Advent Movement, thousands of\r\nsinners had been converted, and faithful men were giving themselves to the\r\nwork of proclaiming the truth, even in the tarrying time. The prince of\r\nevil was losing his subjects; and in order to bring reproach upon the\r\ncause of God, he sought to deceive some who professed the faith, and to\r\ndrive them to extremes. Then his agents stood ready to seize upon every\r\nerror, every failure, every unbecoming act, and hold it up before the\r\npeople in the most exaggerated light, to render Adventists and their faith\r\nodious. Thus the greater the number whom he could crowd in to make a\r\nprofession of faith in the second advent while his power controlled their\r\nhearts, the greater advantage would he gain by calling attention to them\r\nas representatives of the whole body of believers.\r\n\r\nSatan is “the accuser of the brethren,” and it is his spirit that inspires\r\nmen to watch for the errors and defects of the Lord’s people, and to hold\r\nthem up to notice, while their good deeds are passed by without a mention.\r\nHe is always active when God is at work for the salvation of souls. When\r\nthe sons of God come to present themselves before the Lord, Satan comes\r\nalso among them. In every revival he is ready to bring in those who are\r\nunsanctified in heart and unbalanced in mind. When these have accepted\r\nsome points of truth, and gained a place with believers, he works through\r\nthem to introduce theories that will deceive the unwary. No man is proved\r\nto be a true Christian because he is found in company with the children of\r\nGod, even in the house of worship and around the table of the Lord. Satan\r\nis frequently there upon the most solemn occasions, in the form of those\r\nwhom he can use as his agents.\r\n\r\nThe prince of evil contests every inch of ground over which God’s people\r\nadvance in their journey toward the heavenly city. In all the history of\r\nthe church, no reformation has been carried forward without encountering\r\nserious obstacles. Thus it was in Paul’s day. Wherever the apostle raised\r\nup a church, there were some who professed to receive the faith, but who\r\nbrought in heresies, that, if received, would eventually crowd out the\r\nlove of the truth. Luther also suffered great perplexity and distress from\r\nthe course of fanatical persons who claimed that God had spoken directly\r\nthrough them, and who therefore set their own ideas and opinions above the\r\ntestimony of the Scriptures. Many who were lacking in faith and\r\nexperience, but who had considerable self-sufficiency, and who loved to\r\nhear and tell some new thing, were beguiled by the pretensions of the new\r\nteachers, and they joined the agents of Satan in their work of tearing\r\ndown what God had moved Luther to build up. And the Wesleys, and others\r\nwho blessed the world by their influence and their faith, encountered at\r\nevery step the wiles of Satan in pushing overzealous, unbalanced, and\r\nunsanctified ones into fanaticism of every grade.\r\n\r\nWilliam Miller had no sympathy with those influences that led to\r\nfanaticism. He declared, with Luther, that every spirit should be tested\r\nby the word of God. “The devil,” said Miller, “has great power over the\r\nminds of some at the present day. And how shall we know what manner of\r\nspirit they are of? The Bible answers: ‘By their fruits ye shall know\r\nthem.’... There are many spirits gone out into the world; and we are\r\ncommanded to try the spirits. The spirit that does not cause us to live\r\nsoberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world, is not the Spirit\r\nof Christ. I am more and more convinced that Satan has much to do in these\r\nwild movements.... Many among us, who pretend to be wholly sanctified, are\r\nfollowing the traditions of men, and apparently are as ignorant of truth\r\nas others who make no such pretensions.”(646) “The spirit of error will\r\nlead us from the truth; and the Spirit of God will lead us into truth.\r\nBut, say you, a man may be in an error, and think he has the truth. What\r\nthen? We answer, The Spirit and word agree. If a man judges himself by the\r\nword of God, and finds a perfect harmony through the whole word, then he\r\nmust believe he has the truth; but if he finds the spirit by which he is\r\nled does not harmonize with the whole tenor of God’s law or book, then let\r\nhim walk carefully, lest he be caught in the snare of the devil.”(647) “I\r\nhave often obtained more evidence of inward piety from a kindling eye, a\r\nwet cheek, and a choked utterance, than from all the noise in\r\nChristendom.”(648)\r\n\r\nIn the days of the Reformation its enemies charged all the evils of\r\nfanaticism upon the very ones who were laboring most earnestly against it.\r\nA similar course was pursued by the opposers of the Advent Movement. And\r\nnot content with misrepresenting and exaggerating the errors of extremists\r\nand fanatics, they circulated unfavorable reports that had not the\r\nslightest semblance of truth. These persons were actuated by prejudice and\r\nhatred. Their peace was disturbed by the proclamation of Christ at the\r\ndoor. They feared it might be true, yet hoped it was not, and this was the\r\nsecret of their warfare against Adventists and their faith.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a few fanatics worked their way into the ranks of Adventists\r\nis no more a reason to decide that the movement was not of God, than was\r\nthe presence of fanatics and deceivers in the church in Paul’s or Luther’s\r\nday a sufficient excuse for condemning their work. Let the people of God\r\narouse out of sleep, and begin in earnest the work of repentance and\r\nreformation; let them search the Scriptures to learn the truth as it is in\r\nJesus; let them make an entire consecration to God, and evidence will not\r\nbe wanting that Satan is still active and vigilant. With all possible\r\ndeception he will manifest his power, calling to his aid all the fallen\r\nangels of his realm.\r\n\r\nIt was not the proclamation of the second advent that created fanaticism\r\nand division. These appeared in the summer of 1844, when Adventists were\r\nin a state of doubt and perplexity concerning their real position. The\r\npreaching of the first angel’s message and of the “midnight cry” tended\r\ndirectly to repress fanaticism and dissension. Those who participated in\r\nthese solemn movements were in harmony; their hearts were filled with love\r\nfor one another, and for Jesus, whom they expected soon to see. The one\r\nfaith, the one blessed hope, lifted them above the control of any human\r\ninfluence, and proved a shield against the assaults of Satan.\r\n\r\n“While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. And at\r\nmidnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to\r\nmeet him. Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.”(649) In\r\nthe summer of 1844, midway between the time when it had been first thought\r\nthat the 2300 days would end, and the autumn of the same year, to which it\r\nwas afterward found that they extended, the message was proclaimed in the\r\nvery words of Scripture, “Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!”\r\n\r\nThat which led to this movement was the discovery that the decree of\r\nArtaxerxes for the restoration of Jerusalem, which formed the\r\nstarting-point for the period of the 2300 days, went into effect in the\r\nautumn of the year B.C. 457, and not at the beginning of the year, as had\r\nbeen formerly believed. Reckoning from the autumn of 457, the 2300 years\r\nterminate in the autumn of 1844.(650)\r\n\r\nArguments drawn from the Old Testament types also pointed to the autumn as\r\nthe time when the event represented by the “cleansing of the sanctuary”\r\nmust take place. This was made very clear as attention was given to the\r\nmanner in which the types relating to the first advent of Christ had been\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe slaying of the Passover lamb was a shadow of the death of Christ. Says\r\nPaul, “Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.”(651) The sheaf of\r\nfirst-fruits, which at the time of the Passover was waved before the Lord,\r\nwas typical of the resurrection of Christ. Paul says, in speaking of the\r\nresurrection of the Lord, and of all His people, “Christ the first-fruits;\r\nafterward they that are Christ’s at His coming.”(652) Like the wave-sheaf,\r\nwhich was the first ripe grain gathered before the harvest, Christ is the\r\nfirst-fruits of that immortal harvest of redeemed ones that at the future\r\nresurrection shall be gathered into the garner of God.\r\n\r\nThese types were fulfilled, not only as to the event, but as to the time.\r\nOn the fourteenth day of the first Jewish month, the very day and month on\r\nwhich, for fifteen long centuries, the Passover lamb had been slain,\r\nChrist, having eaten the Passover with His disciples, instituted that\r\nfeast which was to commemorate His own death as “the Lamb of God, which\r\ntaketh away the sin of the world.” That same night He was taken by wicked\r\nhands, to be crucified and slain. And as the antitype of the wave-sheaf,\r\nour Lord was raised from the dead on the third day, “the first-fruits of\r\nthem that slept,”(653) a sample of all the resurrected just, whose “vile\r\nbody” shall be changed, and “fashioned like unto His glorious body.”(654)\r\n\r\nIn like manner, the types which relate to the second advent must be\r\nfulfilled at the time pointed out in the symbolic service. Under the\r\nMosaic system, the cleansing of the sanctuary, or the great day of\r\natonement, occurred on the tenth day of the seventh Jewish month,(655)\r\nwhen the high priest, having made an atonement for all Israel, and thus\r\nremoved their sins from the sanctuary, came forth and blessed the people.\r\nSo it was believed that Christ, our great High Priest, would appear to\r\npurify the earth by the destruction of sin and sinners, and to bless His\r\nwaiting people with immortality. The tenth day of the seventh month, the\r\ngreat day of atonement, the time of the cleansing of the sanctuary, which\r\nin the year 1844 fell upon the twenty-second of October, was regarded as\r\nthe time of the Lord’s coming. This was in harmony with the proofs already\r\npresented, that the 2300 days would terminate in the autumn, and the\r\nconclusion seemed irresistible.\r\n\r\nIn the parable of Matthew 25 the time of waiting and slumber is followed\r\nby the coming of the bridegroom. This was in accordance with the arguments\r\njust presented, both from prophecy and from the types. They carried strong\r\nconviction of their truthfulness; and the “midnight cry” was heralded by\r\nthousands of believers.\r\n\r\nLike a tidal wave the movement swept over the land. From city to city,\r\nfrom village to village, and into remote country places it went, until the\r\nwaiting people of God were fully aroused. Fanaticism disappeared before\r\nthis proclamation, like early frost before the rising sun. Believers saw\r\ntheir doubt and perplexity removed, and hope and courage animated their\r\nhearts. The work was free from those extremes which are ever manifested\r\nwhen there is human excitement without the controlling influence of the\r\nword and Spirit of God. It was similar in character to those seasons of\r\nhumiliation and returning unto the Lord which among ancient Israel\r\nfollowed messages of reproof from His servants. It bore the\r\ncharacteristics that mark the work of God in every age. There was little\r\necstatic joy, but rather deep searching of heart, confession of sin, and\r\nforsaking of the world. A preparation to meet the Lord was the burden of\r\nagonizing spirits. There was persevering prayer, and unreserved\r\nconsecration to God.\r\n\r\nSaid Miller, in describing that work: “There is no great expression of\r\njoy: that is, as it were, suppressed for a future occasion, when all\r\nheaven and earth will rejoice together with joy unspeakable and full of\r\nglory. There is no shouting: that, too, is reserved for the shout from\r\nheaven. The singers are silent: they are waiting to join the angelic\r\nhosts, the choir from heaven.... There is no clashing of sentiments: all\r\nare of one heart and of one mind.”(656)\r\n\r\nAnother who participated in the movement testified: “It produced\r\neverywhere the most deep searching of heart and humiliation of soul before\r\nthe God of high heaven. It caused a weaning of affections from the things\r\nof this world, a healing of controversies and animosities, a confession of\r\nwrongs, a breaking down before God, and penitent, broken-hearted\r\nsupplications to Him for pardon and acceptance. It caused self-abasement\r\nand prostration of soul, such as we never before witnessed. As God by Joel\r\ncommanded, when the great day of God should be at hand, it produced a\r\nrending of hearts and not of garments, and a turning unto the Lord with\r\nfasting, and weeping, and mourning. As God said by Zechariah, a spirit of\r\ngrace and supplication was poured out upon His children; they looked to\r\nHim whom they had pierced, there was a great mourning in the land, ... and\r\nthose who were looking for the Lord afflicted their souls before\r\nHim.”(657)\r\n\r\nOf all the great religious movements since the days of the apostles, none\r\nhave been more free from human imperfection and the wiles of Satan than\r\nwas that of the autumn of 1844. Even now, after the lapse of many years,\r\nall who shared in that movement and who have stood firm upon the platform\r\nof truth, still feel the holy influence of that blessed work, and bear\r\nwitness that it was of God.\r\n\r\nAt the call, “The Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him,” the waiting\r\nones “arose and trimmed their lamps;” they studied the word of God with an\r\nintensity of interest before unknown. Angels were sent from heaven to\r\narouse those who had become discouraged, and prepare them to receive the\r\nmessage. The work did not stand in the wisdom and learning of men, but in\r\nthe power of God. It was not the most talented, but the most humble and\r\ndevoted, who were the first to hear and obey the call. Farmers left their\r\ncrops standing in the fields, mechanics laid down their tools, and with\r\ntears and rejoicing went out to give the warning. Those who had formerly\r\nled in the cause were among the last to join in this movement. The\r\nchurches in general closed their doors against this message, and a large\r\ncompany of those who received it withdrew from their connection. In the\r\nprovidence of God, this proclamation united with the second angel’s\r\nmessage, and gave power to that work.\r\n\r\nThe message, “Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!” was not so much a matter of\r\nargument, though the Scripture proof was clear and conclusive. There went\r\nwith it an impelling power that moved the soul. There was no doubt, no\r\nquestioning. Upon the occasion of Christ’s triumphal entry into Jerusalem,\r\nthe people who were assembled from all parts of the land to keep the\r\nfeast, flocked to the Mount of Olives, and as they joined the throng that\r\nwere escorting Jesus, they caught the inspiration of the hour, and helped\r\nto swell the shout, “Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the\r\nLord!”(658) In like manner did unbelievers who flocked to the Adventist\r\nmeetings—some from curiosity, some merely to ridicule—feel the convincing\r\npower attending the message, “Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!”\r\n\r\nAt that time there was faith that brought answers to prayer,—faith that\r\nhad respect to the recompense of reward. Like showers of rain upon the\r\nthirsty earth, the Spirit of grace descended upon the earnest seekers.\r\nThose who expected soon to stand face to face with their Redeemer, felt a\r\nsolemn joy that was unutterable. The softening, subduing power of the Holy\r\nSpirit melted the heart, as His blessing was bestowed in rich measure upon\r\nthe faithful, believing ones.\r\n\r\nCarefully and solemnly those who received the message came up to the time\r\nwhen they hoped to meet their Lord. Every morning they felt that it was\r\ntheir first duty to secure the evidence of their acceptance with God.\r\nTheir hearts were closely united, and they prayed much with and for one\r\nanother. They often met together in secluded places to commune with God,\r\nand the voice of intercession ascended to heaven from the fields and\r\ngroves. The assurance of the Saviour’s approval was more necessary to them\r\nthan their daily food; and if a cloud darkened their minds, they did not\r\nrest until it was swept away. As they felt the witness of pardoning grace,\r\nthey longed to behold Him whom their souls loved.\r\n\r\nBut again they were destined to disappointment. The time of expectation\r\npassed, and their Saviour did not appear. With unwavering confidence they\r\nhad looked forward to His coming, and now they felt as did Mary, when,\r\ncoming to the Saviour’s tomb and finding it empty, she exclaimed with\r\nweeping, “They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have\r\nlaid Him.”(659)\r\n\r\nA feeling of awe, a fear that the message might be true, had for a time\r\nserved as a restraint upon the unbelieving world. After the passing of the\r\ntime, this did not at once disappear; at first they dared not triumph over\r\nthe disappointed ones; but as no tokens of God’s wrath were seen, they\r\nrecovered from their fears, and resumed their reproach and ridicule. A\r\nlarge class who had professed to believe in the Lord’s soon coming,\r\nrenounced their faith. Some who had been very confident were so deeply\r\nwounded in their pride that they felt like fleeing from the world. Like\r\nJonah, they complained of God, and chose death rather than life.\r\n\r\nThose who had based their faith upon the opinions of others, and not upon\r\nthe word of God, were now as ready again to change their views. The\r\nscoffers won the weak and cowardly to their ranks, and all these united in\r\ndeclaring that there could be no more fears or expectations now. The time\r\nhad passed, the Lord had not come, and the world might remain the same for\r\nthousands of years.\r\n\r\nThe earnest, sincere believers had given up all for Christ, and had shared\r\nHis presence as never before. They had, as they believed, given their last\r\nwarning to the world; and expecting soon to be received into the society\r\nof their divine Master and the heavenly angels, they had, to a great\r\nextent, withdrawn from the society of those who did not receive the\r\nmessage. With intense desire they had prayed, “Come, Lord Jesus, and come\r\nquickly.” But He had not come. And now to take up again the heavy burden\r\nof life’s cares and perplexities, and to endure the taunts and sneers of a\r\nscoffing world, was a terrible trial of faith and patience.\r\n\r\nYet this disappointment was not so great as was that experienced by the\r\ndisciples at the time of Christ’s first advent. When Jesus rode\r\ntriumphantly into Jerusalem, His followers believed that He was about to\r\nascend the throne of David, and deliver Israel from her oppressors. With\r\nhigh hopes and joyful anticipations they vied with one another in showing\r\nhonor to their King. Many spread their outer garments as a carpet in His\r\npath, or strewed before Him the leafy branches of the palm. In their\r\nenthusiastic joy they united in the glad acclaim, “Hosanna to the Son of\r\nDavid!” When the Pharisees, disturbed and angered by this outburst of\r\nrejoicing, wished Jesus to rebuke His disciples, He replied, “If these\r\nshould hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.”(660)\r\nProphecy must be fulfilled. The disciples were accomplishing the purpose\r\nof God; yet they were doomed to a bitter disappointment. But a few days\r\nhad passed ere they witnessed the Saviour’s agonizing death, and laid Him\r\nin the tomb. Their expectations had not been realized in a single\r\nparticular, and their hopes died with Jesus. Not till their Lord had come\r\nforth triumphant from the grave could they perceive that all had been\r\nforetold by prophecy, and “that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen\r\nagain from the dead.”(661)\r\n\r\nFive hundred years before, the Lord had declared by the prophet Zechariah,\r\n“Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem:\r\nbehold, thy King cometh unto thee: He is just, and having salvation;\r\nlowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.”(662)\r\nHad the disciples realized that Christ was going to judgment and to death,\r\nthey could not have fulfilled this prophecy.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, Miller and his associates fulfilled prophecy, and gave a\r\nmessage which Inspiration had foretold should be given to the world, but\r\nwhich they could not have given had they fully understood the prophecies\r\npointing out their disappointment, and presenting another message to be\r\npreached to all nations before the Lord should come. The first and second\r\nangels’ messages were given at the right time, and accomplished the work\r\nwhich God designed to accomplish by them.\r\n\r\nThe world had been looking on, expecting that if the time passed and\r\nChrist did not appear, the whole system of Adventism would be given up.\r\nBut while many, under strong temptation, yielded their faith, there were\r\nsome who stood firm. The fruits of the Advent Movement, the spirit of\r\nhumility and heart-searching, of renouncing of the world and reformation\r\nof life, which had attended the work, testified that it was of God. They\r\ndared not deny that the power of the Holy Spirit had witnessed to the\r\npreaching of the second advent, and they could detect no error in their\r\nreckoning of the prophetic periods. The ablest of their opponents had not\r\nsucceeded in overthrowing their system of prophetic interpretation. They\r\ncould not consent, without Bible evidence, to renounce positions which had\r\nbeen reached through earnest, prayerful study of the Scriptures, by minds\r\nenlightened by the Spirit of God, and hearts burning with its living\r\npower; positions which had withstood the most searching criticisms and the\r\nmost bitter opposition of popular religious teachers and worldly-wise men,\r\nand which had stood firm against the combined forces of learning and\r\neloquence, and the taunts and revilings alike of the honorable and the\r\nbase.\r\n\r\nTrue, there had been a failure as to the expected event, but even this\r\ncould not shake their faith in the word of God. When Jonah proclaimed in\r\nthe streets of Nineveh that within forty days the city would be\r\noverthrown, the Lord accepted the humiliation of the Ninevites, and\r\nextended their period of probation; yet the message of Jonah was sent of\r\nGod, and Nineveh was tested according to His will. Adventists believed\r\nthat in like manner God had led them to give the warning of the judgment.\r\n“It has,” they declared, “tested the hearts of all who heard it, and\r\nawakened a love for the Lord’s appearing; or it has called forth a hatred,\r\nmore or less perceivable, but known to God, of His coming. It has drawn a\r\nline, ... so that those who will examine their own hearts, may know on\r\nwhich side of it they would have been found, had the Lord then\r\ncome—whether they would have exclaimed, ‘Lo! this is our God, we have\r\nwaited for Him, and He will save us;’ or whether they would have called to\r\nthe rocks and mountains to fall on them to hide them from the face of Him\r\nthat sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb. God thus, as\r\nwe believe, has tested His people, has tried their faith, has proved them,\r\nand seen whether they would shrink, in the hour of trial, from the\r\nposition in which He might see fit to place them; and whether they would\r\nrelinquish this world and rely with implicit confidence in the word of\r\nGod.”(663)\r\n\r\nThe feelings of those who still believed that God had led them in their\r\npast experience, are expressed in the words of William Miller: “Were I to\r\nlive my life over again, with the same evidence that I then had, to be\r\nhonest with God and man I should have to do as I have done.” “I hope that\r\nI have cleansed my garments from the blood of souls. I feel that, as far\r\nas it was in my power, I have freed myself from all guilt in their\r\ncondemnation.” “Although I have been twice disappointed,” wrote this man\r\nof God, “I am not yet cast down or discouraged.... My hope in the coming\r\nof Christ is as strong as ever. I have done only what, after years of\r\nsolemn consideration, I felt it my solemn duty to do. If I have erred, it\r\nhas been on the side of charity, love to my fellow-men, and conviction of\r\nduty to God.” “One thing I do know, I have preached nothing but what I\r\nbelieved; and God has been with me; His power has been manifested in the\r\nwork, and much good has been effected.” “Many thousands, to all human\r\nappearance, have been made to study the Scriptures by the preaching of the\r\ntime; and by that means, through faith and the sprinkling of the blood of\r\nChrist, have been reconciled to God.”(664) “I have never courted the\r\nsmiles of the proud, nor quailed when the world frowned. I shall not now\r\npurchase their favor, nor shall I go beyond duty to tempt their hate. I\r\nshall never seek my life at their hands, nor shrink, I hope, from losing\r\nit, if God in His good providence so orders.”(665)\r\n\r\nGod did not forsake His people; His Spirit still abode with those who did\r\nnot rashly deny the light which they had received, and denounce the Advent\r\nMovement. In the Epistle to the Hebrews are words of encouragement and\r\nwarning for the tried, waiting ones at this crisis: “Cast not away\r\ntherefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward. For ye\r\nhave need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might\r\nreceive the promise. For yet a little while, and He that shall come will\r\ncome, and will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man\r\ndraw back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them\r\nwho draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of\r\nthe soul.”(666)\r\n\r\nThat this admonition is addressed to the church in the last days is\r\nevident from the words pointing to the nearness of the Lord’s coming: “For\r\nyet a little while, and He that shall come will come, and will not tarry.”\r\nAnd it is plainly implied that there would be a seeming delay, and that\r\nthe Lord would appear to tarry. The instruction here given is especially\r\nadapted to the experience of Adventists at this time. The people here\r\naddressed were in danger of making shipwreck of faith. They had done the\r\nwill of God in following the guidance of His Spirit and His word; yet they\r\ncould not understand His purpose in their past experience, nor could they\r\ndiscern the pathway before them, and they were tempted to doubt whether\r\nGod had indeed been leading them. At this time the words were applicable,\r\n“Now the just shall live by faith.” As the bright light of the “midnight\r\ncry” had shone upon their pathway, and they had seen the prophecies\r\nunsealed, and the rapidly fulfilling signs telling that the coming of\r\nChrist was near, they had walked, as it were, by sight. But now, bowed\r\ndown by disappointed hopes, they could stand only by faith in God and in\r\nHis word. The scoffing world were saying: “You have been deceived. Give up\r\nyour faith, and say that the Advent Movement was of Satan.” But God’s word\r\ndeclared, “If any man draw back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him.”\r\nTo renounce their faith now, and deny the power of the Holy Spirit which\r\nhad attended the message, would be drawing back toward perdition. They\r\nwere encouraged to steadfastness by the words of Paul, “Cast not away\r\ntherefore your confidence;” “ye have need of patience,” “for yet a little\r\nwhile, and He that shall come will come, and will not tarry.” Their only\r\nsafe course was to cherish the light which they had already received of\r\nGod, hold fast to His promises, and continue to search the Scriptures, and\r\npatiently wait and watch to receive further light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23. WHAT IS THE SANCTUARY?\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nThe scripture which above all others had been both the foundation and the\r\ncentral pillar of the advent faith, was the declaration, “Unto two\r\nthousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be\r\ncleansed.”(667) These had been familiar words to all believers in the\r\nLord’s soon coming. By the lips of thousands was this prophecy repeated as\r\nthe watchword of their faith. All felt that upon the events therein\r\nforetold depended their brightest expectations and most cherished hopes.\r\nThese prophetic days had been shown to terminate in the autumn of 1844. In\r\ncommon with the rest of the Christian world, Adventists then held that the\r\nearth, or some portion of it, was the sanctuary. They understood that the\r\ncleansing of the sanctuary was the purification of the earth by the fires\r\nof the last great day, and that this would take place at the second\r\nadvent. Hence the conclusion that Christ would return to the earth in\r\n1844.\r\n\r\nBut the appointed time had passed, and the Lord had not appeared. The\r\nbelievers knew that God’s word could not fail; their interpretation of the\r\nprophecy must be at fault; but where was the mistake? Many rashly cut the\r\nknot of difficulty by denying that the 2300 days ended in 1844. No reason\r\ncould be given for this, except that Christ had not come at the time they\r\nexpected Him. They argued that if the prophetic days had ended in 1844,\r\nChrist would then have returned to cleanse the sanctuary by the\r\npurification of the earth by fire; and that since He had not come, the\r\ndays could not have ended.\r\n\r\nTo accept this conclusion was to renounce the former reckoning of the\r\nprophetic periods. The 2300 days had been found to begin when the\r\ncommandment of Artaxerxes for the restoration and building of Jerusalem,\r\nwent into effect, in the autumn of B.C. 457. Taking this as the\r\nstarting-point, there was perfect harmony in the application of all the\r\nevents foretold in the explanation of that period in Dan. 9:25-27.\r\nSixty-nine weeks, the first 483 of the 2300 years, were to reach to the\r\nMessiah, the Anointed One; and Christ’s baptism and anointing by the Holy\r\nSpirit, A.D. 27, exactly fulfilled the specification. In the midst of the\r\nseventieth week, Messiah was to be cut off. Three and a half years after\r\nHis baptism, Christ was crucified, in the spring of A.D. 31. The seventy\r\nweeks, or 490 years, were to pertain especially to the Jews. At the\r\nexpiration of this period, the nation sealed its rejection of Christ by\r\nthe persecution of His disciples, and the apostles turned to the Gentiles,\r\nA.D. 34. The first 490 years of the 2300 having then ended, 1810 years\r\nwould remain. From A.D. 34, 1810 years extend to 1844. “Then,” said the\r\nangel, “shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” All the preceding specifications\r\nof the prophecy had been unquestionably fulfilled at the time appointed.\r\n\r\nWith this reckoning, all was clear and harmonious, except that it was not\r\nseen that any event answering to the cleansing of the sanctuary had taken\r\nplace in 1844. To deny that the days ended at that time was to involve the\r\nwhole question in confusion, and to renounce positions which had been\r\nestablished by unmistakable fulfilments of prophecy.\r\n\r\nBut God had led His people in the great Advent Movement; His power and\r\nglory had attended the work, and He would not permit it to end in darkness\r\nand disappointment, to be reproached as a false and fanatical excitement.\r\nHe would not leave His word involved in doubt and uncertainty. Though many\r\nabandoned their former reckoning of the prophetic periods, and denied the\r\ncorrectness of the movement based thereon, others were unwilling to\r\nrenounce points of faith and experience that were sustained by the\r\nScriptures and by the witness of the Spirit of God. They believed that\r\nthey had adopted sound principles of interpretation in their study of the\r\nprophecies, and that it was their duty to hold fast the truths already\r\ngained, and to continue the same course of biblical research. With earnest\r\nprayer they reviewed their position, and studied the Scriptures to\r\ndiscover their mistake. As they could see no error in their reckoning of\r\nthe prophetic periods, they were led to examine more closely the subject\r\nof the sanctuary.\r\n\r\nIn their investigation they learned that there is no Scripture evidence\r\nsustaining the popular view that the earth is the sanctuary; but they\r\nfound in the Bible a full explanation of the subject of the sanctuary, its\r\nnature, location, and services; the testimony of the sacred writers being\r\nso clear and ample as to place the matter beyond all question. The apostle\r\nPaul, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, says: “Then verily the first covenant\r\nhad also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary. For there\r\nwas a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the\r\ntable, and the showbread; which is called the sanctuary. And after the\r\nsecond veil, the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all; which had\r\nthe golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with\r\ngold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that\r\nbudded, and the tables of the covenant; and over it the cherubim of glory\r\nshadowing the mercy-seat.”(668)\r\n\r\nThe sanctuary to which Paul here refers was the tabernacle built by Moses\r\nat the command of God, as the earthly dwelling-place of the Most High.\r\n“Let them make Me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them,”(669) was the\r\ndirection given to Moses while in the mount with God. The Israelites were\r\njourneying through the wilderness, and the tabernacle was so constructed\r\nthat it could be removed from place to place; yet it was a structure of\r\ngreat magnificence. Its walls consisted of upright boards heavily plated\r\nwith gold, and set in sockets of silver, while the roof was formed of a\r\nseries of curtains, or coverings, the outer of skins, the innermost of\r\nfine linen beautifully wrought with figures of cherubim. Besides the outer\r\ncourt, which contained the altar of burnt-offering, the tabernacle itself\r\nconsisted of two apartments called the holy and the most holy place,\r\nseparated by a rich and beautiful curtain, or veil; a similar veil closed\r\nthe entrance to the first apartment.\r\n\r\nIn the holy place was the candlestick, on the south, with its seven lamps\r\ngiving light to the sanctuary both by day and by night; on the north stood\r\nthe table of showbread; and before the veil separating the holy from the\r\nmost holy was the golden altar of incense, from which the cloud of\r\nfragrance, with the prayers of Israel, was daily ascending before God.\r\n\r\nIn the most holy place stood the ark, a chest of precious wood overlaid\r\nwith gold, the depository of the two tables of stone upon which God had\r\ninscribed the law of ten commandments. Above the ark, and forming the\r\ncover to the sacred chest, was the mercy-seat, a magnificent piece of\r\nworkmanship, surmounted by two cherubim, one at each end, and all wrought\r\nof solid gold. In this apartment the divine presence was manifested in the\r\ncloud of glory between the cherubim.\r\n\r\nAfter the settlement of the Hebrews in Canaan, the tabernacle was replaced\r\nby the temple of Solomon, which, though a permanent structure and upon a\r\nlarger scale, observed the same proportions, and was similarly furnished.\r\nIn this form the sanctuary existed—except while it lay in ruins in\r\nDaniel’s time—until its destruction by the Romans, in A.D. 70.\r\n\r\nThis is the only sanctuary that ever existed on the earth, of which the\r\nBible gives any information. This was declared by Paul to be the sanctuary\r\nof the first covenant. But has the new covenant no sanctuary?\r\n\r\nTurning again to the book of Hebrews, the seekers for truth found that the\r\nexistence of a second, or new-covenant sanctuary, was implied in the words\r\nof Paul already quoted: “Then verily the first covenant had _also_\r\nordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.” And the use of the\r\nword “also” intimates that Paul has before made mention of this sanctuary.\r\nTurning back to the beginning of the previous chapter, they read: “Now of\r\nthe things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high\r\npriest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the\r\nheavens; a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which\r\nthe Lord pitched, and not man.”(670)\r\n\r\nHere is revealed the sanctuary of the new covenant. The sanctuary of the\r\nfirst covenant was pitched by man, built by Moses; this is pitched by the\r\nLord, not by man. In that sanctuary the earthly priests performed their\r\nservice; in this, Christ, our great high priest, ministers at God’s right\r\nhand. One sanctuary was on earth, the other is in heaven.\r\n\r\nFurther, the tabernacle built by Moses was made after a pattern. The Lord\r\ndirected him, “According to all that I show thee, after the pattern of the\r\ntabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall\r\nye make it.” And again the charge was given, “Look that thou make them\r\nafter their pattern, which was showed thee in the mount.”(671) And Paul\r\nsays that the first tabernacle “was a figure for the time then present, in\r\nwhich were offered both gifts and sacrifices;” that its holy places were\r\n“patterns of things in the heavens;” that the priests who offered gifts\r\naccording to the law, served “unto the example and shadow of heavenly\r\nthings,” and that “Christ is not entered into the holy places made with\r\nhands, which are the figures of the true, but into heaven itself, now to\r\nappear in the presence of God for us.”(672)\r\n\r\nThe sanctuary in heaven, in which Jesus ministers in our behalf, is the\r\ngreat original, of which the sanctuary built by Moses was a copy. God\r\nplaced His Spirit upon the builders of the earthly sanctuary. The artistic\r\nskill displayed in its construction was a manifestation of divine wisdom.\r\nThe walls had the appearance of massive gold, reflecting in every\r\ndirection the light of the seven lamps of the golden candlestick. The\r\ntable of showbread and the altar of incense glittered like burnished gold.\r\nThe gorgeous curtain which formed the ceiling, inwrought with figures of\r\nangels in blue and purple and scarlet, added to the beauty of the scene.\r\nAnd beyond the second veil was the holy shekinah, the visible\r\nmanifestation of God’s glory, before which none but the high priest could\r\nenter and live.\r\n\r\nThe matchless splendor of the earthly tabernacle reflected to human vision\r\nthe glories of that heavenly temple where Christ our forerunner ministers\r\nfor us before the throne of God. The abiding-place of the King of kings,\r\nwhere thousand thousands minister unto Him, and ten thousand times ten\r\nthousand stand before Him;(673) that temple, filled with the glory of the\r\neternal throne, where seraphim, its shining guardians, veil their faces in\r\nadoration, could find, in the most magnificent structure ever reared by\r\nhuman hands, but a faint reflection of its vastness and glory. Yet\r\nimportant truths concerning the heavenly sanctuary and the great work\r\nthere carried forward for man’s redemption, were taught by the earthly\r\nsanctuary and its services.\r\n\r\nThe holy places of the sanctuary in heaven are represented by the two\r\napartments in the sanctuary on earth. As in vision the apostle John was\r\ngranted a view of the temple of God in heaven, he beheld there “seven\r\nlamps of fire burning before the throne.”(674) He saw an angel “having a\r\ngolden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should\r\noffer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was\r\nbefore the throne.”(675) Here the prophet was permitted to behold the\r\nfirst apartment of the sanctuary in heaven; and he saw there the “seven\r\nlamps of fire” and the “golden altar,” represented by the golden\r\ncandlestick and the altar of incense in the sanctuary on earth. Again,\r\n“the temple of God was opened,”(676) and he looked within the inner veil,\r\nupon the holy of holies. Here he beheld “the ark of His testament,”\r\nrepresented by the sacred chest constructed by Moses to contain the law of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nThus those who were studying the subject found indisputable proof of the\r\nexistence of a sanctuary in heaven. Moses made the earthly sanctuary after\r\na pattern which was shown him. Paul teaches that that pattern was the true\r\nsanctuary which is in heaven. And John testifies that he saw it in heaven.\r\n\r\nIn the temple in heaven, the dwelling-place of God, His throne is\r\nestablished in righteousness and judgment. In the most holy place is His\r\nlaw, the great rule of right by which all mankind are tested. The ark that\r\nenshrines the tables of the law is covered with the mercy-seat, before\r\nwhich Christ pleads His blood in the sinner’s behalf. Thus is represented\r\nthe union of justice and mercy in the plan of human redemption. This union\r\ninfinite wisdom alone could devise, and infinite power accomplish; it is a\r\nunion that fills all heaven with wonder and adoration. The cherubim of the\r\nearthly sanctuary, looking reverently down upon the mercy-seat, represent\r\nthe interest with which the heavenly host contemplate the work of\r\nredemption. This is the mystery of mercy into which angels desire to\r\nlook,—that God can be just while He justifies the repenting sinner, and\r\nrenews His intercourse with the fallen race; that Christ could stoop to\r\nraise unnumbered multitudes from the abyss of ruin, and clothe them with\r\nthe spotless garments of His own righteousness, to unite with angels who\r\nhave never fallen, and to dwell forever in the presence of God.\r\n\r\nThe work of Christ as man’s intercessor is presented in that beautiful\r\nprophecy of Zechariah concerning Him “whose name is The Branch.” Says the\r\nprophet: “He shall build the temple of the Lord; and He shall bear the\r\nglory, and shall sit and rule upon His [the Father’s] throne; and He shall\r\nbe a priest upon His throne: and the _counsel of peace_ shall be between\r\nThem both.”(677)\r\n\r\n“He shall build the temple of the Lord.” By His sacrifice and mediation,\r\nChrist is both the foundation and the builder of the church of God. The\r\napostle Paul points to Him as “the chief corner-stone; in whom all the\r\nbuilding fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord: in\r\nwhom ye also,” he says, “are builded together for a habitation of God\r\nthrough the Spirit.”(678)\r\n\r\n“He shall bear the glory.” To Christ belongs the glory of redemption for\r\nthe fallen race. Through the eternal ages, the song of the ransomed ones\r\nwill be, “Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own\r\nblood, ... to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever.”(679)\r\n\r\nHe “shall sit and rule upon His throne; and He shall be a priest upon His\r\nthrone.” Not now “upon the throne of His glory;” the kingdom of glory has\r\nnot yet been ushered in. Not until His work as a mediator shall be ended,\r\nwill God “give unto Him the throne of His father David,” a kingdom of\r\nwhich “there shall be no end.”(680) As a priest, Christ is now set down\r\nwith the Father in His throne.(681) Upon the throne with the eternal,\r\nself-existent One, is He who “hath borne our griefs, and carried our\r\nsorrows,” who “was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin,”\r\nthat He might be “able to succor them that are tempted.” “If any man sin,\r\nwe have an Advocate with the Father.”(682) His intercession is that of a\r\npierced and broken body, of a spotless life. The wounded hands, the\r\npierced side, the marred feet, plead for fallen man, whose redemption was\r\npurchased at such infinite cost.\r\n\r\n“And the counsel of peace shall be between Them both.” The love of the\r\nFather, no less than of the Son, is the fountain of salvation for the lost\r\nrace. Said Jesus to His disciples, before He went away, “I say not unto\r\nyou, that I will pray the Father for you: for the Father Himself loveth\r\nyou.”(683) God was “in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself.”(684)\r\nAnd in the ministration in the sanctuary above, “the counsel of peace\r\nshall be between Them both.” “God _so loved_ the world, that He gave His\r\nonly begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but\r\nhave everlasting life.”(685)\r\n\r\nThe question, What is the sanctuary? is clearly answered in the\r\nScriptures. The term “sanctuary,” as used in the Bible, refers, first, to\r\nthe tabernacle built by Moses, as a pattern of heavenly things; and,\r\nsecondly, to the “true tabernacle” in heaven, to which the earthly\r\nsanctuary pointed. At the death of Christ the typical service ended. The\r\n“true tabernacle” in heaven is the sanctuary of the new covenant. And as\r\nthe prophecy of Dan. 8:14 is fulfilled in this dispensation, the sanctuary\r\nto which it refers must be the sanctuary of the new covenant. At the\r\ntermination of the 2300 days, in 1844, there had been no sanctuary on\r\nearth for many centuries. Thus the prophecy, “Unto two thousand and three\r\nhundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed,” unquestionably points\r\nto the sanctuary in heaven.\r\n\r\nBut the most important question remains to be answered: What is the\r\ncleansing of the sanctuary? That there was such a service in connection\r\nwith the earthly sanctuary, is stated in the Old Testament Scriptures. But\r\ncan there be anything in heaven to be cleansed? In Hebrews 9 the cleansing\r\nof both the earthly and the heavenly sanctuary is plainly taught. “Almost\r\nall things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood\r\nis no remission. It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in\r\nthe heavens should be purified with these [the blood of animals]; but the\r\nheavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these,”(686) even\r\nthe precious blood of Christ.\r\n\r\nThe cleansing, both in the typical and in the real service, must be\r\naccomplished with blood: in the former, with the blood of animals; in the\r\nlatter, with the blood of Christ. Paul states, as the reason why this\r\ncleansing must be performed with blood, that without shedding of blood is\r\nno _remission_. Remission, or putting away of sin, is the work to be\r\naccomplished. But how could there be sin connected with the sanctuary,\r\neither in heaven or upon the earth? This may be learned by reference to\r\nthe symbolic service; for the priests who officiated on earth, served\r\n“unto the example and shadow of heavenly things.”(687)\r\n\r\nThe ministration of the earthly sanctuary consisted of two divisions; the\r\npriests ministered daily in the holy place, while once a year the high\r\npriest performed a special work of atonement in the most holy, for the\r\ncleansing of the sanctuary. Day by day the repentant sinner brought his\r\noffering to the door of the tabernacle, and placing his hand upon the\r\nvictim’s head, confessed his sins, thus in figure transferring them from\r\nhimself to the innocent sacrifice. The animal was then slain. “Without\r\nshedding of blood,” says the apostle, there is no remission of sin. “The\r\nlife of the flesh is in the blood.”(688) The broken law of God demanded\r\nthe life of the transgressor. The blood, representing the forfeited life\r\nof the sinner, whose guilt the victim bore, was carried by the priest into\r\nthe holy place and sprinkled before the veil, behind which was the ark\r\ncontaining the law that the sinner had transgressed. By this ceremony the\r\nsin was, through the blood, transferred in figure to the sanctuary. In\r\nsome cases the blood was not taken into the holy place; but the flesh was\r\nthen to be eaten by the priest, as Moses directed the sons of Aaron,\r\nsaying, “God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the\r\ncongregation.”(689) Both ceremonies alike symbolized the transfer of the\r\nsin from the penitent to the sanctuary.\r\n\r\nSuch was the work that went on, day by day, throughout the year. The sins\r\nof Israel were thus transferred to the sanctuary, and a special work\r\nbecame necessary for their removal. God commanded that an atonement be\r\nmade for each of the sacred apartments. “He shall make an atonement for\r\nthe holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and\r\nbecause of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for\r\nthe tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst\r\nof their uncleanness.” An atonement was also to be made for the altar, to\r\n“cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of\r\nIsrael.”(690)\r\n\r\nOnce a year, on the great day of atonement, the priest entered the most\r\nholy place for the cleansing of the sanctuary. The work there performed\r\ncompleted the yearly round of ministration. On the day of atonement, two\r\nkids of the goats were brought to the door of the tabernacle, and lots\r\nwere cast upon them, “one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the\r\nscapegoat.”(691) The goat upon which fell the lot for the Lord was to be\r\nslain as a sin-offering for the people. And the priest was to bring his\r\nblood within the veil, and sprinkle it upon the mercy-seat, and before the\r\nmercy-seat. The blood was also to be sprinkled upon the altar of incense,\r\nthat was before the veil.\r\n\r\n“And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and\r\nconfess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all\r\ntheir transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the\r\ngoat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the\r\nwilderness: and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a\r\nland not inhabited.”(692) The scapegoat came no more into the camp of\r\nIsrael, and the man who led him away was required to wash himself and his\r\nclothing with water before returning to the camp.\r\n\r\nThe whole ceremony was designed to impress the Israelites with the\r\nholiness of God and His abhorrence of sin; and, further, to show them that\r\nthey could not come in contact with sin without becoming polluted. Every\r\nman was required to afflict his soul while this work of atonement was\r\ngoing forward. All business was to be laid aside, and the whole\r\ncongregation of Israel were to spend the day in solemn humiliation before\r\nGod, with prayer, fasting, and deep searching of heart.\r\n\r\nImportant truths concerning the atonement are taught by the typical\r\nservice. A substitute was accepted in the sinner’s stead; but the sin was\r\nnot canceled by the blood of the victim. A means was thus provided by\r\nwhich it was transferred to the sanctuary. By the offering of blood, the\r\nsinner acknowledged the authority of the law, confessed his guilt in\r\ntransgression, and expressed his desire for pardon through faith in a\r\nRedeemer to come; but he was not yet entirely released from the\r\ncondemnation of the law. On the day of atonement the high priest, having\r\ntaken an offering from the congregation, went into the most holy place\r\nwith the blood of this offering, and sprinkled it upon the mercy-seat,\r\ndirectly over the law, to make satisfaction for its claims. Then, in his\r\ncharacter of mediator, he took the sins upon himself and bore them from\r\nthe sanctuary. Placing his hands upon the head of the scapegoat, he\r\nconfessed over him all these sins, thus in figure transferring them from\r\nhimself to the goat. The goat then bore them away, and they were regarded\r\nas forever separated from the people.\r\n\r\nSuch was the service performed “unto the example and shadow of heavenly\r\nthings.” And what was done in type in the ministration of the earthly\r\nsanctuary, is done in reality in the ministration of the heavenly\r\nsanctuary. After His ascension, our Saviour began His work as our high\r\npriest. Says Paul, “Christ is not entered into the holy places made with\r\nhands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to\r\nappear in the presence of God for us.”(693)\r\n\r\nThe ministration of the priest throughout the year in the first apartment\r\nof the sanctuary, “within the veil” which formed the door and separated\r\nthe holy place from the outer court, represents the work of ministration\r\nupon which Christ entered at His ascension. It was the work of the priest\r\nin the daily ministration to present before God the blood of the\r\nsin-offering, also the incense which ascended with the prayers of Israel.\r\nSo did Christ plead His blood before the Father in behalf of sinners, and\r\npresent before Him also, with the precious fragrance of His own\r\nrighteousness, the prayers of penitent believers. Such was the work of\r\nministration in the first apartment of the sanctuary in heaven.\r\n\r\nThither the faith of Christ’s disciples followed Him as He ascended from\r\ntheir sight. Here their hopes centered, “which hope we have,” said Paul,\r\n“as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth\r\ninto that within the veil; whither the forerunner is for us entered, even\r\nJesus, made an high priest forever.” “Neither by the blood of goats and\r\ncalves, but by His own blood He entered in once into the holy place,\r\nhaving obtained eternal redemption for us.”(694)\r\n\r\nFor eighteen centuries this work of ministration continued in the first\r\napartment of the sanctuary. The blood of Christ, pleaded in behalf of\r\npenitent believers, secured their pardon and acceptance with the Father,\r\nyet their sins still remained upon the books of record. As in the typical\r\nservice there was a work of atonement at the close of the year, so before\r\nChrist’s work for the redemption of men is completed, there is a work of\r\natonement for the removal of sin from the sanctuary. This is the service\r\nwhich began when the 2300 days ended. At that time, as foretold by Daniel\r\nthe prophet, our High Priest entered the most holy, to perform the last\r\ndivision of His solemn work,—to cleanse the sanctuary.\r\n\r\nAs anciently the sins of the people were by faith placed upon the\r\nsin-offering, and through its blood transferred, in figure, to the earthly\r\nsanctuary; so in the new covenant the sins of the repentant are by faith\r\nplaced upon Christ, and transferred, in fact, to the heavenly sanctuary.\r\nAnd as the typical cleansing of the earthly was accomplished by the\r\nremoval of the sins by which it had been polluted, so the actual cleansing\r\nof the heavenly is to be accomplished by the removal, or blotting out, of\r\nthe sins which are there recorded. But before this can be accomplished,\r\nthere must be an examination of the books of record to determine who,\r\nthrough repentance of sin and faith in Christ, are entitled to the\r\nbenefits of His atonement. The cleansing of the sanctuary therefore\r\ninvolves a work of investigation,—a work of judgment. This work must be\r\nperformed prior to the coming of Christ to redeem His people; for when He\r\ncomes, His reward is with Him to give to every man according to his\r\nworks.(695)\r\n\r\nThus those who followed in the light of the prophetic word saw that,\r\ninstead of coming to the earth at the termination of the 2300 days in\r\n1844, Christ then entered the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary,\r\nto perform the closing work of atonement, preparatory to His coming.\r\n\r\nIt was seen, also, that while the sin-offering pointed to Christ as a\r\nsacrifice, and the high priest represented Christ as a mediator, the\r\nscapegoat typified Satan, the author of sin, upon whom the sins of the\r\ntruly penitent will finally be placed. When the high priest, by virtue of\r\nthe blood of the sin-offering, removed the sins from the sanctuary, he\r\nplaced them upon the scapegoat. When Christ, by virtue of His own blood,\r\nremoves the sins of His people from the heavenly sanctuary at the close of\r\nHis ministration, He will place them upon Satan, who, in the execution of\r\nthe judgment, must bear the final penalty. The scapegoat was sent away\r\ninto a land not inhabited, never to come again into the congregation of\r\nIsrael. So will Satan be forever banished from the presence of God and His\r\npeople, and he will be blotted from existence in the final destruction of\r\nsin and sinners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24. IN THE HOLY OF HOLIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nThe subject of the sanctuary was the key which unlocked the mystery of the\r\ndisappointment of 1844. It opened to view a complete system of truth,\r\nconnected and harmonious, showing that God’s hand had directed the great\r\nAdvent Movement, and revealing present duty as it brought to light the\r\nposition and work of His people. As the disciples of Jesus, after the\r\nterrible night of their anguish and disappointment, were “glad when they\r\nsaw the Lord,” so did those now rejoice who had looked in faith for His\r\nsecond coming. They had expected Him to appear in glory to give reward to\r\nHis servants. As their hopes were disappointed, they had lost sight of\r\nJesus, and with Mary at the sepulcher they cried, “They have taken away my\r\nLord, and I know not where they have laid Him.” Now in the holy of holies\r\nthey again beheld Him, their compassionate high priest, soon to appear as\r\ntheir king and deliverer. Light from the sanctuary illumed the past, the\r\npresent, and the future. They knew that God had led them by His unerring\r\nprovidence. Though, like the first disciples, they themselves had failed\r\nto understand the message which they bore, yet it had been in every\r\nrespect correct. In proclaiming it they had fulfilled the purpose of God,\r\nand their labor had not been in vain in the Lord. “Begotten again unto a\r\nlively hope,” they rejoiced “with joy unspeakable and full of glory.”\r\n\r\nBoth the prophecy of Dan. 8:14, “Unto two thousand and three hundred days;\r\nthen shall the sanctuary be cleansed,” and the first angel’s message,\r\n“Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come,”\r\npointed to Christ’s ministration in the most holy place, to the\r\ninvestigative judgment, and not to the coming of Christ for the redemption\r\nof His people and the destruction of the wicked. The mistake had not been\r\nin the reckoning of the prophetic periods, but in the _event_ to take\r\nplace at the end of the 2300 days. Through this error the believers had\r\nsuffered disappointment, yet all that was foretold by the prophecy, and\r\nall that they had any Scripture warrant to expect, had been accomplished.\r\nAt the very time when they were lamenting the failure of their hopes, the\r\nevent had taken place which was foretold by the message, and which must be\r\nfulfilled before the Lord could appear to give reward to His servants.\r\n\r\nChrist had come, not to the earth, as they expected, but, as foreshadowed\r\nin the type, to the most holy place of the temple of God in heaven. He is\r\nrepresented by the prophet Daniel as coming at this time to the Ancient of\r\ndays: “I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man\r\ncame with the clouds of heaven, and came”—not to the earth, but—“to the\r\nAncient of days, and they brought Him near before Him.”(696)\r\n\r\nThis coming is foretold also by the prophet Malachi: “The Lord, whom ye\r\nseek, shall suddenly come to His temple, even the messenger of the\r\ncovenant, whom ye delight in: behold, He shall come, saith the Lord of\r\nhosts.”(697) The coming of the Lord to His temple was sudden, unexpected,\r\nto His people. They were not looking for Him _there_. They expected Him to\r\ncome to earth, “in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not\r\nGod, and that obey not the gospel.”(698)\r\n\r\nBut the people were not yet ready to meet their Lord. There was still a\r\nwork of preparation to be accomplished for them. Light was to be given,\r\ndirecting their minds to the temple of God in heaven; and as they should\r\nby faith follow their High Priest in His ministration there, new duties\r\nwould be revealed. Another message of warning and instruction was to be\r\ngiven to the church.\r\n\r\nSays the prophet: “Who may abide the day of His coming? and who shall\r\nstand when He appeareth? for He is like a refiner’s fire, and like\r\nfullers’ soap: and He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and\r\nHe shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that\r\nthey may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.”(699) Those who\r\nare living upon the earth when the intercession of Christ shall cease in\r\nthe sanctuary above, are to stand in the sight of a holy God without a\r\nmediator. Their robes must be spotless, their characters must be purified\r\nfrom sin by the blood of sprinkling. Through the grace of God and their\r\nown diligent effort, they must be conquerors in the battle with evil.\r\nWhile the investigative judgment is going forward in heaven, while the\r\nsins of penitent believers are being removed from the sanctuary, there is\r\nto be a special work of purification, of putting away of sin, among God’s\r\npeople upon earth. This work is more clearly presented in the messages of\r\nRevelation 14.\r\n\r\nWhen this work shall have been accomplished, the followers of Christ will\r\nbe ready for His appearing. “Then shall the offering of Judah and\r\nJerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in\r\nformer years.”(700) Then the church which our Lord at His coming is to\r\nreceive to Himself will be “a glorious church, not having spot, or\r\nwrinkle, or any such thing.”(701) Then she will look forth “as the\r\nmorning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with\r\nbanners.”(702)\r\n\r\nBesides the coming of the Lord to His temple, Malachi also foretells His\r\nsecond advent, His coming for the execution of the judgment, in these\r\nwords: “And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift\r\nwitness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against\r\nfalse swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages,\r\nthe widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his\r\nright, and fear not Me, saith the Lord of hosts.”(703) Jude refers to the\r\nsame scene when he says, “Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of\r\nHis saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are\r\nungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds.”(704) This coming, and the\r\ncoming of the Lord to His temple, are distinct and separate events.\r\n\r\nThe coming of Christ as our high priest to the most holy place, for the\r\ncleansing of the sanctuary, brought to view in Dan. 8:14; the coming of\r\nthe Son of man to the Ancient of days, as presented in Dan. 7:13; and the\r\ncoming of the Lord to His temple, foretold by Malachi, are descriptions of\r\nthe same event; and this is also represented by the coming of the\r\nbridegroom to the marriage, described by Christ in the parable of the ten\r\nvirgins, of Matthew 25.\r\n\r\nIn the summer and autumn of 1844, the proclamation, “Behold, the\r\nBridegroom cometh,” was given. The two classes represented by the wise and\r\nfoolish virgins were then developed,—one class who looked with joy to the\r\nLord’s appearing, and who had been diligently preparing to meet Him;\r\nanother class that, influenced by fear, and acting from impulse, had been\r\nsatisfied with a theory of the truth, but were destitute of the grace of\r\nGod. In the parable, when the bridegroom came, “they that were ready went\r\nin with him to the marriage.” The coming of the bridegroom, here brought\r\nto view, takes place before the marriage. The marriage represents the\r\nreception by Christ of His kingdom. The holy city, the New Jerusalem,\r\nwhich is the capital and representative of the kingdom, is called “the\r\nbride, the Lamb’s wife.” Said the angel to John, “Come hither, I will show\r\nthee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.” “He carried me away in the spirit,” says\r\nthe prophet, “and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem,\r\ndescending out of heaven from God.”(705) Clearly, then, the bride\r\nrepresents the holy city, and the virgins that go out to meet the\r\nbridegroom are a symbol of the church. In the Revelation the people of God\r\nare said to be the guests at the marriage supper.(706) If _guests_, they\r\ncannot be represented also as the _bride_. Christ, as stated by the\r\nprophet Daniel, will receive from the Ancient of days in heaven,\r\n“dominion, and glory, and a kingdom;” He will receive the New Jerusalem,\r\nthe capital of His kingdom, “prepared as a bride adorned for her\r\nhusband.”(707) Having received the kingdom, He will come in His glory, as\r\nKing of kings and Lord of lords, for the redemption of His people, who are\r\nto “sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,” at His table in His\r\nkingdom,(708) to partake of the marriage supper of the Lamb.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation, “Behold, the Bridegroom cometh,” in the summer of 1844,\r\nled thousands to expect the immediate advent of the Lord. At the appointed\r\ntime the Bridegroom came, not to the earth, as the people expected, but to\r\nthe Ancient of days in heaven, to the marriage, the reception of His\r\nkingdom. “They that were ready went in with Him to the marriage, and the\r\ndoor was shut.” They were not to be present in person at the marriage; for\r\nit takes place in heaven, while they are upon the earth. The followers of\r\nChrist are to “wait for their Lord, when He will _return from_ the\r\nwedding.”(709) But they are to understand His work, and to follow Him by\r\nfaith as He goes in before God. It is in this sense that they are said to\r\ngo in to the marriage.\r\n\r\nIn the parable it was those that had oil in their vessels with their lamps\r\nthat went in to the marriage. Those who, with a knowledge of the truth\r\nfrom the Scriptures, had also the Spirit and grace of God, and who, in the\r\nnight of their bitter trial, had patiently waited, searching the Bible for\r\nclearer light,—these saw the truth concerning the sanctuary in heaven and\r\nthe Saviour’s change of ministration, and by faith they followed Him in\r\nHis work in the sanctuary above. And all who through the testimony of the\r\nScriptures accept the same truths, following Christ by faith as He enters\r\nin before God to perform the last work of mediation, and at its close to\r\nreceive His kingdom,—all these are represented as going in to the\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nIn the parable of Matthew 22 the same figure of the marriage is\r\nintroduced, and the investigative judgment is clearly represented as\r\ntaking place before the marriage. Previous to the wedding the king comes\r\nin to see the guests,(710) to see if all are attired in the wedding\r\ngarment, the spotless robe of character washed and made white in the blood\r\nof the Lamb.(711) He who is found wanting is cast out, but all who upon\r\nexamination are seen to have the wedding garment on, are accepted of God,\r\nand accounted worthy of a share in His kingdom and a seat upon His throne.\r\nThis work of examination of character, of determining who are prepared for\r\nthe kingdom of God, is that of the investigative judgment, the closing\r\nwork in the sanctuary above.\r\n\r\nWhen the work of investigation shall be ended, when the cases of those who\r\nin all ages have professed to be followers of Christ have been examined\r\nand decided, then, and not till then, probation will close, and the door\r\nof mercy will be shut. Thus in the one short sentence, “They that were\r\nready went in with Him to the marriage, and the door was shut,” we are\r\ncarried down through the Saviour’s final ministration, to the time when\r\nthe great work for man’s salvation shall be completed.\r\n\r\nIn the service of the earthly sanctuary, which, as we have seen, is a\r\nfigure of the service in the heavenly, when the high priest on the day of\r\natonement entered the most holy place, the ministration in the first\r\napartment ceased. God commanded, “There shall be no man in the tabernacle\r\nof the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy\r\nplace, until he come out.”(712) So when Christ entered the holy of holies\r\nto perform the closing work of the atonement, He ceased His ministration\r\nin the first apartment. But when the ministration in the first apartment\r\nended, the ministration in the second apartment began. When in the typical\r\nservice the high priest left the holy on the day of atonement, he went in\r\nbefore God to present the blood of the sin-offering in behalf of all\r\nIsrael who truly repented of their sins. So Christ had only completed one\r\npart of His work as our intercessor, to enter upon another portion of the\r\nwork, and He still pleaded His blood before the Father in behalf of\r\nsinners.\r\n\r\nThis subject was not understood by Adventists in 1844. After the passing\r\nof the time when the Saviour was expected, they still believed His coming\r\nto be near; they held that they had reached an important crisis, and that\r\nthe work of Christ as man’s intercessor before God, had ceased. It\r\nappeared to them to be taught in the Bible, that man’s probation would\r\nclose a short time before the actual coming of the Lord in the clouds of\r\nheaven. This seemed evident from those scriptures which point to a time\r\nwhen men will seek, knock, and cry at the door of mercy, and it will not\r\nbe opened. And it was a question with them whether the date to which they\r\nhad looked for the coming of Christ might not rather mark the beginning of\r\nthis period which was immediately to precede His coming. Having given the\r\nwarning of the judgment near, they felt that their work for the world was\r\ndone, and they lost their burden of soul for the salvation of sinners,\r\nwhile the bold and blasphemous scoffing of the ungodly seemed to them\r\nanother evidence that the Spirit of God had been withdrawn from the\r\nrejecters of His mercy. All this confirmed them in the belief that\r\nprobation had ended, or, as they then expressed it, “the door of mercy was\r\nshut.”\r\n\r\nBut clearer light came with the investigation of the sanctuary question.\r\nThey now saw that they were correct in believing that the end of the 2300\r\ndays in 1844 marked an important crisis. But while it was true that that\r\ndoor of hope and mercy by which men had for eighteen hundred years found\r\naccess to God, was closed, another door was opened, and forgiveness of\r\nsins was offered to men through the intercession of Christ in the most\r\nholy. One part of His ministration had closed, only to give place to\r\nanother. There was still an “open door” to the heavenly sanctuary, where\r\nChrist was ministering in the sinner’s behalf.\r\n\r\nNow was seen the application of those words of Christ in the Revelation,\r\naddressed to the church at this very time: “These things saith He that is\r\nholy, He that is true, He that hath the key of David, He that openeth, and\r\nno man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth; I know thy works:\r\nbehold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it.”(713)\r\n\r\nIt is those who by faith follow Jesus in the great work of the atonement,\r\nwho receive the benefits of His mediation in their behalf; while those who\r\nreject the light which brings to view this work of ministration, are not\r\nbenefited thereby. The Jews who rejected the light given at Christ’s first\r\nadvent, and refused to believe on Him as the Saviour of the world, could\r\nnot receive pardon through Him. When Jesus at His ascension entered by His\r\nown blood into the heavenly sanctuary to shed upon His disciples the\r\nblessings of His mediation, the Jews were left in total darkness, to\r\ncontinue their useless sacrifices and offerings. The ministration of types\r\nand shadows had ceased. That door by which men had formerly found access\r\nto God, was no longer open. The Jews had refused to seek Him in the only\r\nway whereby He could then be found, through the ministration in the\r\nsanctuary in heaven. Therefore they found no communion with God. To them\r\nthe door was shut. They had no knowledge of Christ as the true sacrifice\r\nand the only mediator before God; hence they could not receive the\r\nbenefits of His mediation.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the unbelieving Jews illustrates the condition of the\r\ncareless and unbelieving among professed Christians, who are willingly\r\nignorant of the work of our merciful High Priest. In the typical service,\r\nwhen the high priest entered the most holy place, all Israel were required\r\nto gather about the sanctuary, and in the most solemn manner humble their\r\nsouls before God, that they might receive the pardon of their sins, and\r\nnot be cut off from the congregation. How much more essential in this\r\nantitypical day of atonement that we understand the work of our High\r\nPriest, and know what duties are required of us.\r\n\r\nMen cannot with impunity reject the warnings which God in mercy sends\r\nthem. A message was sent from heaven to the world in Noah’s day, and their\r\nsalvation depended upon the manner in which they treated that message.\r\nBecause they rejected the warning, the Spirit of God was withdrawn from\r\nthe sinful race, and they perished in the waters of the flood. In the time\r\nof Abraham, mercy ceased to plead with the guilty inhabitants of Sodom,\r\nand all but Lot with his wife and two daughters, were consumed by the fire\r\nsent down from heaven. So in the days of Christ. The Son of God declared\r\nto the unbelieving Jews of that generation, “Your house is left unto you\r\ndesolate.”(714) Looking down to the last days, the same Infinite Power\r\ndeclares, concerning those who “\"received not the love of the truth, that\r\nthey might be saved,” “For this cause God shall send them strong delusion,\r\nthat they should believe a lie: that they all might be damned who believed\r\nnot the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.”(715) As they reject\r\nthe teachings of His word, God withdraws His Spirit, and leaves them to\r\nthe deceptions which they love.\r\n\r\nBut Christ still intercedes in man’s behalf, and light will be given to\r\nthose who seek it. Though this was not at first understood by Adventists,\r\nit was afterward made plain, as the scriptures which define their true\r\nposition began to open before them.\r\n\r\nThe passing of the time in 1844 was followed by a period of great trial to\r\nthose who still held the advent faith. Their only relief, so far as\r\nascertaining their true position was concerned, was the light which\r\ndirected their minds to the sanctuary above. Some renounced their faith in\r\ntheir former reckoning of the prophetic periods, and ascribed to human or\r\nsatanic agencies the powerful influence of the Holy Spirit which had\r\nattended the Advent Movement. Another class firmly held that the Lord had\r\nled them in their past experience; and as they waited and watched and\r\nprayed to know the will of God, they saw that their great High Priest had\r\nentered upon another work of ministration, and following Him by faith,\r\nthey were led to see also the closing work of the church. They had a\r\nclearer understanding of the first and second angels’ messages, and were\r\nprepared to receive and give to the world the solemn warning of the third\r\nangel of Revelation 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25. GOD’S LAW IMMUTABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\n“The temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in His temple\r\nthe ark of His testament.”(716) The ark of God’s testament is in the holy\r\nof holies, the second apartment of the sanctuary. In the ministration of\r\nthe earthly tabernacle, which served “unto the example and shadow of\r\nheavenly things,” this apartment was opened only upon the great day of\r\natonement, for the cleansing of the sanctuary. Therefore the announcement\r\nthat the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of His testament\r\nwas seen, points to the opening of the most holy place of the heavenly\r\nsanctuary, in 1844, as Christ entered there to perform the closing work of\r\nthe atonement. Those who by faith followed their great High Priest, as He\r\nentered upon His ministry in the most holy place, beheld the ark of His\r\ntestament. As they had studied the subject of the sanctuary, they had come\r\nto understand the Saviour’s change of ministration, and they saw that He\r\nwas now officiating before the ark of God, pleading His blood in behalf of\r\nsinners.\r\n\r\nThe ark in the tabernacle on earth contained the two tables of stone, upon\r\nwhich were inscribed the precepts of the law of God. The ark was merely a\r\nreceptacle for the tables of the law, and the presence of these divine\r\nprecepts gave to it its value and sacredness. When the temple of God was\r\nopened in heaven, the ark of His testament was seen. Within the holy of\r\nholies, in the sanctuary in heaven, the divine law is sacredly\r\nenshrined,—the law that was spoken by God Himself amid the thunders of\r\nSinai, and written with His own finger on the tables of stone.\r\n\r\nThe law of God in the sanctuary in heaven is the great original, of which\r\nthe precepts inscribed upon the tables of stone, and recorded by Moses in\r\nthe Pentateuch, were an unerring transcript. Those who arrived at an\r\nunderstanding of this important point, were thus led to see the sacred,\r\nunchanging character of the divine law. They saw, as never before, the\r\nforce of the Saviour’s words, “Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one\r\ntittle shall in no wise pass from the law.”(717) The law of God, being a\r\nrevelation of His will, a transcript of His character, must forever\r\nendure, “as a faithful witness in heaven.” Not one command has been\r\nannulled; not a jot or tittle has been changed. Says the psalmist:\r\n“Forever, O Lord, Thy word is settled in heaven.” “All His commandments\r\nare sure. They stand fast forever and ever.”(718)\r\n\r\nIn the very bosom of the decalogue is the fourth commandment, as it was\r\nfirst proclaimed: “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days\r\nshalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath\r\nof the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son,\r\nnor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle,\r\nnor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made\r\nheaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh\r\nday: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.”(719)\r\n\r\nThe Spirit of God impressed the hearts of those students of His word. The\r\nconviction was urged upon them, that they had ignorantly transgressed this\r\nprecept by disregarding the Creator’s rest-day. They began to examine the\r\nreasons for observing the first day of the week instead of the day which\r\nGod had sanctified. They could find no evidence in the Scriptures that the\r\nfourth commandment had been abolished, or that the Sabbath had been\r\nchanged; the blessing which first hallowed the seventh day had never been\r\nremoved. They had been honestly seeking to know and to do God’s will; now,\r\nas they saw themselves transgressors of His law, sorrow filled their\r\nhearts, and they manifested their loyalty to God by keeping His Sabbath\r\nholy.\r\n\r\nMany and earnest were the efforts made to overthrow their faith. None\r\ncould fail to see that if the earthly sanctuary was a figure or pattern of\r\nthe heavenly, the law deposited in the ark on earth was an exact\r\ntranscript of the law in the ark in heaven; and that an acceptance of the\r\ntruth concerning the heavenly sanctuary involved an acknowledgment of the\r\nclaims of God’s law, and the obligation of the Sabbath of the fourth\r\ncommandment. Here was the secret of the bitter and determined opposition\r\nto the harmonious exposition of the Scriptures that revealed the\r\nministration of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary. Men sought to close the\r\ndoor which God had opened, and to open the door which He had closed. But\r\n“He that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth,”\r\nhad declared, “Behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can\r\nshut it.”(720) Christ had opened the door, or ministration, of the most\r\nholy place, light was shining from that open door of the sanctuary in\r\nheaven, and the fourth commandment was shown to be included in the law\r\nwhich is there enshrined; what God had established, no man could\r\noverthrow.\r\n\r\nThose who had accepted the light concerning the mediation of Christ and\r\nthe perpetuity of the law of God, found that these were the truths\r\npresented in Revelation 14. The messages of this chapter constitute a\r\nthreefold warning,(721) which is to prepare the inhabitants of the earth\r\nfor the Lord’s second coming. The announcement, “The hour of His judgment\r\nis come,” points to the closing work of Christ’s ministration for the\r\nsalvation of men. It heralds a truth which must be proclaimed until the\r\nSaviour’s intercession shall cease, and He shall return to the earth to\r\ntake His people to Himself. The work of judgment which began in 1844, must\r\ncontinue until the cases of all are decided, both of the living and the\r\ndead; hence it will extend to the close of human probation. That men may\r\nbe prepared to stand in the judgment, the message commands them to “fear\r\nGod, and give glory to Him,” “and worship Him that made heaven, and earth,\r\nand the sea, and the fountains of waters.” The result of an acceptance of\r\nthese messages is given in the words, “Here are they that keep the\r\ncommandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” In order to be prepared for\r\nthe judgment, it is necessary that men should keep the law of God. That\r\nlaw will be the standard of character in the judgment. The apostle Paul\r\ndeclares, “As many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law,\r\n... in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.”\r\nAnd he says that “the doers of the law shall be justified.”(722) Faith is\r\nessential in order to the keeping of the law of God; for “without faith it\r\nis impossible to please Him.” And “whatsoever is not of faith is\r\nsin.”(723)\r\n\r\nBy the first angel, men are called upon to “fear God, and give glory to\r\nHim,” and to worship Him as the Creator of the heavens and the earth. In\r\norder to do this, they must obey His law. Says the wise man, “Fear God,\r\nand keep His commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.”(724)\r\nWithout obedience to His commandments, no worship can be pleasing to God.\r\n“This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments.” “He that turneth\r\naway his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be\r\nabomination.”(725)\r\n\r\nThe duty to worship God is based upon the fact that He is the Creator, and\r\nthat to Him all other beings owe their existence. And wherever, in the\r\nBible, His claim to reverence and worship, above the gods of the heathen,\r\nis presented, there is cited the evidence of His creative power. “All the\r\ngods of the nations are idols: but the Lord made the heavens.”(726) “To\r\nwhom then will ye liken Me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. Lift\r\nup your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things.” “Thus\r\nsaith the Lord that created the heavens; God Himself that formed the earth\r\nand made it:... I am Jehovah; and there is none else.”(727) Says the\r\npsalmist, “Know ye that Jehovah, He is God: it is He that hath made us,\r\nand not we ourselves.” “O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel\r\nbefore the Lord our Maker.”(728) And the holy beings who worship God in\r\nheaven state, as the reason why their homage is due to Him, “Thou art\r\nworthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for Thou hast\r\ncreated all things.”(729)\r\n\r\nIn Revelation 14, men are called upon to worship the Creator; and the\r\nprophecy brings to view a class that, as the result of the threefold\r\nmessage, are keeping the commandments of God. One of these commandments\r\npoints directly to God as the creator. The fourth precept declares: “The\r\nseventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: ... for in six days the\r\nLord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested\r\nthe seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed\r\nit.”(730) Concerning the Sabbath, the Lord says, further, that it is “a\r\nsign, ... that ye may know that I am the Lord your God.”(731) And the\r\nreason given is, “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on\r\nthe seventh day He rested, and was refreshed.”(732)\r\n\r\n“The importance of the Sabbath as a memorial of creation is that it keeps\r\never present the true reason why worship is due to God,”—because He is the\r\nCreator, and we are His creatures. “The Sabbath, therefore, lies at the\r\nvery foundation of divine worship; for it teaches this great truth in the\r\nmost impressive manner, and no other institution does this. The true\r\nground of divine worship, not of that on the seventh day merely, but of\r\nall worship, is found in the distinction between the Creator and His\r\ncreatures. This great fact can never become obsolete, and must never be\r\nforgotten.”(733) It was to keep this truth ever before the minds of men,\r\nthat God instituted the Sabbath in Eden; and so long as the fact that He\r\nis our Creator continues to be a reason why we should worship Him, so long\r\nthe Sabbath will continue as its sign and memorial. Had the Sabbath been\r\nuniversally kept, man’s thoughts and affections would have been led to the\r\nCreator as the object of reverence and worship, and there would never have\r\nbeen an idolater, an atheist, or an infidel. The keeping of the Sabbath is\r\na sign of loyalty to the true God, “Him that made heaven, and earth, and\r\nthe sea, and the fountains of waters.” It follows that the message which\r\ncommands men to worship God and keep His commandments, will especially\r\ncall upon them to keep the fourth commandment.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to those who keep the commandments of God and have the faith\r\nof Jesus, the third angel points to another class, against whose errors a\r\nsolemn and fearful warning is uttered: “If any man worship the beast and\r\nhis image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same\r\nshall drink of the wine of the wrath of God.”(734) A correct\r\ninterpretation of the symbols employed is necessary to an understanding of\r\nthis message. What is represented by the beast, the image, the mark?\r\n\r\nThe line of prophecy in which these symbols are found, begins with\r\nRevelation 12, with the dragon that sought to destroy Christ at His birth.\r\nThe dragon is said to be Satan;(735) he it was that moved upon Herod to\r\nput the Saviour to death. But the chief agent of Satan in making war upon\r\nChrist and His people during the first centuries of the Christian era, was\r\nthe Roman empire, in which paganism was the prevailing religion. Thus\r\nwhile the dragon, primarily, represents Satan, it is, in a secondary\r\nsense, a symbol of pagan Rome.\r\n\r\nIn chapter 13(736) is described another beast, “like unto a leopard,” to\r\nwhich the dragon gave “his power, and his seat, and great authority.” This\r\nsymbol, as most Protestants have believed, represents the papacy, which\r\nsucceeded to the power and seat and authority once held by the ancient\r\nRoman empire. Of the leopard-like beast it is declared: “There was given\r\nunto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies.... And he opened\r\nhis mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, and His\r\ntabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. And it was given unto him to\r\nmake war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him\r\nover all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.” This prophecy, which is\r\nnearly identical with the description of the little horn of Daniel 7,\r\nunquestionably points to the papacy.\r\n\r\n“Power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.” And, says the\r\nprophet, “I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death.” And again,\r\n“He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth\r\nwith the sword must be killed with the sword.” The forty and two months\r\nare the same as the “time and times and the dividing of time,” three years\r\nand a half, or 1260 days, of Daniel 7,—the time during which the papal\r\npower was to oppress God’s people. This period, as stated in preceding\r\nchapters, began with the supremacy of the papacy, A.D. 538, and terminated\r\nin 1798. At that time, the pope was made captive by the French army, the\r\npapal power received its deadly wound, and the prediction was fulfilled,\r\n“He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity.”\r\n\r\nAt this point another symbol is introduced. Says the prophet, “I beheld\r\nanother beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a\r\nlamb.”(737) Both the appearance of this beast and the manner of its rise\r\nindicate that the nation which it represents is unlike those presented\r\nunder the preceding symbols. The great kingdoms that have ruled the world\r\nwere presented to the prophet Daniel as beasts of prey, rising when the\r\n“four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.”(738) In Revelation\r\n17, an angel explained that waters represent “peoples, and multitudes, and\r\nnations, and tongues.”(739) Winds are a symbol of strife. The four winds\r\nof heaven striving upon the great sea, represent the terrible scenes of\r\nconquest and revolution by which kingdoms have attained to power.\r\n\r\nBut the beast with lamb-like horns was seen “coming up out of the earth.”\r\nInstead of overthrowing other powers to establish itself, the nation thus\r\nrepresented must arise in territory previously unoccupied, and grow up\r\ngradually and peacefully. It could not, then, arise among the crowded and\r\nstruggling nationalities of the Old World,—that turbulent sea of “peoples,\r\nand multitudes, and nations, and tongues.” It must be sought in the\r\nWestern Continent.\r\n\r\nWhat nation of the New World was in 1798 rising into power, giving promise\r\nof strength and greatness, and attracting the attention of the world? The\r\napplication of the symbol admits of no question. One nation, and only one,\r\nmeets the specifications of this prophecy; it points unmistakably to the\r\nUnited States of America. Again and again the thought, almost the exact\r\nwords, of the sacred writer have been unconsciously employed by the orator\r\nand the historian in describing the rise and growth of this nation. The\r\nbeast was seen “coming up out of the earth;” and according to the\r\ntranslators, the word here rendered “coming up” literally signifies “to\r\ngrow or spring up as a plant.” And, as we have seen, the nation must arise\r\nin territory previously unoccupied. A prominent writer, describing the\r\nrise of the United States, speaks of “_the mystery of her coming forth\r\nfrom vacancy_,”(740) and says, “Like a _silent seed_ we grew into empire.”\r\nA European journal in 1850 spoke of the United States as a wonderful\r\nempire, which was “emerging,” and “_amid the silence of the earth_ daily\r\nadding to its power and pride.”(741) Edward Everett, in an oration on the\r\nPilgrim founders of this nation, said: “Did they look for a retired spot,\r\ninoffensive for its obscurity, and safe in its remoteness, where the\r\nlittle church of Leyden might enjoy the freedom of conscience? Behold the\r\n_mighty regions_ over which, in _peaceful conquest_, ... they have borne\r\nthe banners of the cross!”(742)\r\n\r\n“And he had two horns like a lamb.” The lamb-like horns indicate youth,\r\ninnocence, and gentleness, fitly representing the character of the United\r\nStates when presented to the prophet as “coming up” in 1798. Among the\r\nChristian exiles who first fled to America, and sought an asylum from\r\nroyal oppression and priestly intolerance, were many who determined to\r\nestablish a government upon the broad foundation of civil and religious\r\nliberty. Their view found place in the Declaration of Independence, which\r\nsets forth the great truth that “all men are created equal,” and endowed\r\nwith the inalienable right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness.” And the Constitution guarantees to the people the right of\r\nself-government, providing that representatives elected by the popular\r\nvote shall enact and administer the laws. Freedom of religious faith was\r\nalso granted, every man being permitted to worship God according to the\r\ndictates of his conscience. Republicanism and Protestantism became the\r\nfundamental principles of the nation. These principles are the secret of\r\nits power and prosperity. The oppressed and down-trodden throughout\r\nChristendom have turned to this land with interest and hope. Millions have\r\nsought its shores, and the United States has risen to a place among the\r\nmost powerful nations of the earth.\r\n\r\nBut the beast with lamb-like horns “spake as a dragon. And he exerciseth\r\nall the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and\r\nthem which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound\r\nwas healed; and ... saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they\r\nshould make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword and did\r\nlive.”(743)\r\n\r\nThe lamb-like horns and dragon voice of the symbol point to a striking\r\ncontradiction between the professions and the practice of the nation thus\r\nrepresented. The “speaking” of the nation is the action of its legislative\r\nand judicial authorities. By such action it will give the lie to those\r\nliberal and peaceful principles which it has put forth as the foundation\r\nof its policy. The prediction that it will speak “as a dragon,” and\r\nexercise “all the power of the first beast,” plainly foretells a\r\ndevelopment of the spirit of intolerance and persecution that was\r\nmanifested by the nations represented by the dragon and the leopard-like\r\nbeast. And the statement that the beast with two horns “causeth the earth\r\nand them which dwell therein to worship the first beast,” indicates that\r\nthe authority of this nation is to be exercised in enforcing some\r\nobservance which shall be an act of homage to the papacy.\r\n\r\nSuch action would be directly contrary to the principles of this\r\ngovernment, to the genius of its free institutions, to the direct and\r\nsolemn avowals of the Declaration of Independence, and to the\r\nConstitution. The founders of the nation wisely sought to guard against\r\nthe employment of secular power on the part of the church, with its\r\ninevitable result—intolerance and persecution. The Constitution provides\r\nthat “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\r\nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof,” and that “no religious test\r\nshall ever be required as a qualification to any office of public trust\r\nunder the United States.” Only in flagrant violation of these safeguards\r\nto the nation’s liberty, can any religious observance be enforced by civil\r\nauthority. But the inconsistency of such action is no greater than is\r\nrepresented in the symbol. It is the beast with lamb-like horns—in\r\nprofession pure, gentle, and harmless—that speaks as a dragon.\r\n\r\n“Saying to them that dwell on the earth, that _they_ should make an image\r\nto the beast.” Here is clearly presented a form of government in which the\r\nlegislative power rests with the people; a most striking evidence that the\r\nUnited States is the nation denoted in the prophecy.\r\n\r\nBut what is the “image to the beast”? and how is it to be formed? The\r\nimage is made by the two-horned beast, and is an image _to_ the first\r\nbeast. It is also called an image _of_ the beast. Then to learn what the\r\nimage is like, and how it is to be formed, we must study the\r\ncharacteristics of the beast itself,—the papacy.\r\n\r\nWhen the early church became corrupted by departing from the simplicity of\r\nthe gospel and accepting heathen rites and customs, she lost the Spirit\r\nand power of God; and in order to control the consciences of the people,\r\nshe sought the support of the secular power. The result was the papacy, a\r\nchurch that controlled the power of the state, and employed it to further\r\nher own ends, especially for the punishment of “heresy.” In order for the\r\nUnited States to form an image of the beast, the religious power must so\r\ncontrol the civil government that the authority of the state will also be\r\nemployed by the church to accomplish her own ends.\r\n\r\nWhenever the church has obtained secular power, she has employed it to\r\npunish dissent from her doctrines. Protestant churches that have followed\r\nin the steps of Rome by forming alliance with worldly powers, have\r\nmanifested a similar desire to restrict liberty of conscience. An example\r\nof this is given in the long-continued persecution of dissenters by the\r\nChurch of England. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,\r\nthousands of non-conformist ministers were forced to leave their churches,\r\nand many, both of pastors and people, were subjected to fine,\r\nimprisonment, torture, and martyrdom.\r\n\r\nIt was apostasy that led the early church to seek the aid of the civil\r\ngovernment, and this prepared the way for the development of the\r\npapacy,—the beast. Said Paul, “There” shall “come a falling away, ... and\r\nthat man of sin be revealed.”(744) So apostasy in the church will prepare\r\nthe way for the image to the beast.\r\n\r\nThe Bible declares that before the coming of the Lord there will exist a\r\nstate of religious declension similar to that in the first centuries. “In\r\nthe last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be _lovers of their\r\nown selves,_ covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to\r\nparents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers,\r\nfalse accusers, incontinent, fierce, _despisers of those that are good_,\r\ntraitors, heady, high-minded, _lovers of pleasures more than lovers of\r\nGod; having a form of godliness_, but denying the power thereof.”(745)\r\n“Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall\r\ndepart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of\r\ndevils.”(746) Satan will work “with all power and signs and lying wonders,\r\nand with all deceivableness of unrighteousness.” And all that “received\r\nnot the love of the truth, that they might be saved,” will be left to\r\naccept “strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.”(747) When this\r\nstate of ungodliness shall be reached, the same results will follow as in\r\nthe first centuries.\r\n\r\nThe wide diversity of belief in the Protestant churches is regarded by\r\nmany as decisive proof that no effort to secure a forced uniformity can\r\never be made. But there has been for years, in churches of the Protestant\r\nfaith, a strong and growing sentiment in favor of a union based upon\r\ncommon points of doctrine. To secure such a union, the discussion of\r\nsubjects upon which all were not agreed—however important they might be\r\nfrom a Bible standpoint—must necessarily be waived.\r\n\r\nCharles Beecher, in a sermon in the year 1846, declared that the ministry\r\nof “the evangelical Protestant denominations” is “not only formed all the\r\nway up under a tremendous pressure of merely human fear, but they live,\r\nand move, and breathe in a state of things radically corrupt, and\r\nappealing every hour to every baser element of their nature to hush up the\r\ntruth, and bow the knee to the power of apostasy. Was not this the way\r\nthings went with Rome? Are we not living her life over again? And what do\r\nwe see just ahead? Another general council! A world’s convention!\r\nEvangelical alliance, and universal creed!”(748) When this shall be\r\ngained, then, in the effort to secure complete uniformity, it will be only\r\na step to the resort to force.\r\n\r\nWhen the leading churches of the United States, uniting upon such points\r\nof doctrine as are held by them in common, shall influence the state to\r\nenforce their decrees and to sustain their institutions, then Protestant\r\nAmerica will have formed an image of the Roman hierarchy, and the\r\ninfliction of civil penalties upon dissenters will inevitably result.\r\n\r\nThe beast with two horns “causeth [commands] all, both small and great,\r\nrich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in\r\ntheir foreheads: and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the\r\nmark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.”(749) The third\r\nangel’s warning is, “If any man worship the beast and his image, and\r\nreceive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of\r\nthe wine of the wrath of God.” “The beast” mentioned in this message,\r\nwhose worship is enforced by the two-horned beast, is the first, or\r\nleopard-like beast of Revelation 13,—the papacy. The “image to the beast”\r\nrepresents that form of apostate Protestantism which will be developed\r\nwhen the Protestant churches shall seek the aid of the civil power for the\r\nenforcement of their dogmas. The “mark of the beast” still remains to be\r\ndefined.\r\n\r\nAfter the warning against the worship of the beast and his image, the\r\nprophecy declares, “Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and\r\nthe faith of Jesus.” Since those who keep God’s commandments are thus\r\nplaced in contrast with those that worship the beast and his image and\r\nreceive his mark, it follows that the keeping of God’s law, on the one\r\nhand, and its violation, on the other, will make the distinction between\r\nthe worshipers of God and the worshipers of the beast.\r\n\r\nThe special characteristic of the beast, and therefore of his image, is\r\nthe breaking of God’s commandments. Says Daniel, of the little horn, the\r\npapacy, “He shall think to change the times and the law.”(750) And Paul\r\nstyled the same power the “man of sin,” who was to exalt himself above\r\nGod. One prophecy is a complement of the other. Only by changing God’s law\r\ncould the papacy exalt itself above God; whoever should understandingly\r\nkeep the law as thus changed would be giving supreme honor to that power\r\nby which the change was made. Such an act of obedience to papal laws would\r\nbe a mark of allegiance to the pope in the place of God.\r\n\r\nThe papacy has attempted to change the law of God. The second commandment,\r\nforbidding image worship, has been dropped from the law, and the fourth\r\ncommandment has been so changed as to authorize the observance of the\r\nfirst instead of the seventh day as the Sabbath. But papists urge, as a\r\nreason for omitting the second commandment, that it is unnecessary, being\r\nincluded in the first, and that they are giving the law exactly as God\r\ndesigned it to be understood. This cannot be the change foretold by the\r\nprophet. An intentional, deliberate change is presented: “He shall _think_\r\nto change the times and the law.” The change in the fourth commandment\r\nexactly fulfils the prophecy. For this the only authority claimed is that\r\nof the church. Here the papal power openly sets itself above God.\r\n\r\nWhile the worshipers of God will be especially distinguished by their\r\nregard for the fourth commandment,—since this is the sign of His creative\r\npower, and the witness to His claim upon man’s reverence and homage,—the\r\nworshipers of the beast will be distinguished by their efforts to tear\r\ndown the Creator’s memorial, to exalt the institution of Rome. It was in\r\nbehalf of the Sunday that popery first asserted its arrogant claims;(751)\r\nand its first resort to the power of the state was to compel the\r\nobservance of Sunday as “the Lord’s day.” But the Bible points to the\r\nseventh day, and not to the first, as the Lord’s day. Said Christ, “The\r\nSon of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.” The fourth commandment declares,\r\n“The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord.” And by the prophet Isaiah\r\nthe Lord designates it, “My holy day.”(752)\r\n\r\nThe claim so often put forth, that Christ changed the Sabbath, is\r\ndisproved by His own words. In His sermon on the mount He said: “Think not\r\nthat I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to\r\ndestroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth\r\npass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all\r\nbe fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least\r\ncommandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the\r\nkingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall\r\nbe called great in the kingdom of heaven.”(753)\r\n\r\nIt is a fact generally admitted by Protestants, that the Scriptures give\r\nno authority for the change of the Sabbath. This is plainly stated in\r\npublications issued by the American Tract Society and the American\r\nSunday-school Union. One of these works acknowledges “the complete silence\r\nof the New Testament so far as any explicit command for the Sabbath\r\n[Sunday, the first day of the week] or definite rules for its observance\r\nare concerned.”(754)\r\n\r\nAnother says: “Up to the time of Christ’s death, no change had been made\r\nin the day;”(755) and, “so far as the record shows, they [the apostles]\r\ndid not ... give any explicit command enjoining the abandonment of the\r\nseventh-day Sabbath, and its observance on the first day of the\r\nweek.”(756)\r\n\r\nRoman Catholics acknowledge that the change of the Sabbath was made by\r\ntheir church, and declare that Protestants, by observing the Sunday, are\r\nrecognizing her power. In the “Catholic Catechism of Christian Religion,”\r\nin answer to a question as to the day to be observed in obedience to the\r\nfourth commandment, this statement is made: “During the old law, Saturday\r\nwas the day sanctified; but _the church_, instructed by Jesus Christ, and\r\ndirected by the Spirit of God, has substituted Sunday for Saturday; so now\r\nwe sanctify the first, not the seventh day. Sunday means, and now is, the\r\nday of the Lord.”\r\n\r\nAs the sign of the authority of the Catholic Church, papist writers cite\r\n“the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protestants allow\r\nof; ... because by keeping Sunday, they acknowledge the church’s power to\r\nordain feasts, and to command them under sin.”(757) What then is the\r\nchange of the Sabbath, but the sign, or mark, of the authority of the\r\nRoman Church—“the mark of the beast”?\r\n\r\nThe Roman Church has not relinquished her claim to supremacy; and when the\r\nworld and the Protestant churches accept a sabbath of her creating, while\r\nthey reject the Bible Sabbath, they virtually admit this assumption. They\r\nmay claim the authority of tradition and of the Fathers for the change;\r\nbut in so doing they ignore the very principle which separates them from\r\nRome,—that “the Bible, and the Bible only, is the religion of\r\nProtestants.” The papist can see that they are deceiving themselves,\r\nwillingly closing their eyes to the facts in the case. As the movement for\r\nSunday enforcement gains favor, he rejoices, feeling assured that it will\r\neventually bring the whole Protestant world under the banner of Rome.\r\n\r\nRomanists declare that “the observance of Sunday by the Protestants is an\r\nhomage they pay, in spite of themselves, to the authority of the\r\n[Catholic] Church.”(758) The enforcement of Sunday-keeping on the part of\r\nProtestant churches is an enforcement of the worship of the papacy—of the\r\nbeast. Those who, understanding the claims of the fourth commandment,\r\nchoose to observe the false instead of the true Sabbath, are thereby\r\npaying homage to that power by which alone it is commanded. But in the\r\nvery act of enforcing a religious duty by secular power, the churches\r\nwould themselves form an image to the beast; hence the enforcement of\r\nSunday-keeping in the United States would be an enforcement of the worship\r\nof the beast and his image.\r\n\r\nBut Christians of past generations observed the Sunday, supposing that in\r\nso doing they were keeping the Bible Sabbath; and there are now true\r\nChristians in every church, not excepting the Roman Catholic communion,\r\nwho honestly believe that Sunday is the Sabbath of divine appointment. God\r\naccepts their sincerity of purpose and their integrity before Him. But\r\nwhen Sunday observance shall be enforced by law, and the world shall be\r\nenlightened concerning the obligation of the true Sabbath, then whoever\r\nshall transgress the command of God, to obey a precept which has no higher\r\nauthority than that of Rome, will thereby honor popery above God. He is\r\npaying homage to Rome, and to the power which enforces the institution\r\nordained by Rome. He is worshiping the beast and his image. As men then\r\nreject the institution which God has declared to be the sign of His\r\nauthority, and honor in its stead that which Rome has chosen as the token\r\nof her supremacy, they will thereby accept the sign of allegiance to\r\nRome—“the mark of the beast.” And it is not until the issue is thus\r\nplainly set before the people, and they are brought to choose between the\r\ncommandments of God and the commandments of men, that those who continue\r\nin transgression will receive “the mark of the beast.”\r\n\r\nThe most fearful threatening ever addressed to mortals is contained in the\r\nthird angel’s message. That must be a terrible sin which calls down the\r\nwrath of God unmingled with mercy. Men are not to be left in darkness\r\nconcerning this important matter; the warning against this sin is to be\r\ngiven to the world before the visitation of God’s judgments, that all may\r\nknow why they are to be inflicted, and have opportunity to escape them.\r\nProphecy declares that the first angel would make his announcement to\r\n“every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.” The warning of the\r\nthird angel, which forms a part of the same threefold message, is to be no\r\nless wide-spread. It is represented in the prophecy as being proclaimed\r\nwith a loud voice, by an angel flying in the midst of heaven; and it will\r\ncommand the attention of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the issue of the contest, all Christendom will be divided into two\r\ngreat classes,—those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of\r\nJesus, and those who worship the beast and his image and receive his mark.\r\nAlthough church and state will unite their power to compel “all, both\r\nsmall and great, rich and poor, free and bond,” to receive “the mark of\r\nthe beast,”(759) yet the people of God will not receive it. The prophet of\r\nPatmos beholds “them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over\r\nhis image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on\r\nthe sea of glass, having the harps of God,” and singing the song of Moses\r\nand the Lamb.(760)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26. A WORK OF REFORM.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nThe work of Sabbath reform to be accomplished in the last days is foretold\r\nin the prophecy of Isaiah: “Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do\r\njustice: for My salvation is near to come, and My righteousness to be\r\nrevealed. Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that\r\nlayeth hold on it; that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth\r\nhis hand from doing any evil.” “The sons of the stranger, that join\r\nthemselves to the Lord, to serve Him, and to love the name of the Lord, to\r\nbe His servants, every one that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and\r\ntaketh hold of My covenant; even them will I bring to My holy mountain,\r\nand make them joyful in My house of prayer.”(761)\r\n\r\nThese words apply in the Christian age, as shown by the context: “The Lord\r\nGod which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather others\r\nto him, beside those that are gathered unto him.”(762) Here is\r\nforeshadowed the gathering in of the Gentiles by the gospel. And upon\r\nthose who then honor the Sabbath, a blessing is pronounced. Thus the\r\nobligation of the fourth commandment extends past the crucifixion,\r\nresurrection, and ascension of Christ, to the time when His servants\r\nshould preach to all nations the message of glad tidings.\r\n\r\nThe Lord commands by the same prophet, “Bind up the testimony, seal the\r\nlaw among My disciples.”(763) The seal of God’s law is found in the fourth\r\ncommandment. This only, of all the ten, brings to view both the name and\r\nthe title of the Lawgiver. It declares Him to be the Creator of the\r\nheavens and the earth, and thus shows His claim to reverence and worship\r\nabove all others. Aside from this precept, there is nothing in the\r\ndecalogue to show by whose authority the law is given. When the Sabbath\r\nwas changed by the papal power, the seal was taken from the law. The\r\ndisciples of Jesus are called upon to restore it, by exalting the Sabbath\r\nof the fourth commandment to its rightful position as the Creator’s\r\nmemorial and the sign of His authority.\r\n\r\n“To the law and to the testimony.” While conflicting doctrines and\r\ntheories abound, the law of God is the one unerring rule by which all\r\nopinions, doctrines, and theories are to be tested. Says the prophet, “If\r\nthey speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in\r\nthem.”(764)\r\n\r\nAgain, the command is given, “Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like\r\na trumpet, and show My people their transgression, and the house of Jacob\r\ntheir sins.” It is not the wicked world, but those whom the Lord\r\ndesignates as “My people,” that are to be reproved for their\r\ntransgressions. He declares further, “Yet they seek Me daily, and delight\r\nto know My ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the\r\nordinance of their God.”(765) Here is brought to view a class who think\r\nthemselves righteous, and appear to manifest great interest in the service\r\nof God; but the stern and solemn rebuke of the Searcher of hearts proves\r\nthem to be trampling upon the divine precepts.\r\n\r\nThe prophet thus points out the ordinance which has been forsaken: “Thou\r\nshalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be\r\ncalled, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in. If\r\nthou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My\r\nholy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable;\r\nand shalt honor Him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own\r\npleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in\r\nthe Lord.”(766) This prophecy also applies in our time. The breach was\r\nmade in the law of God when the Sabbath was changed by the Roman power.\r\nBut the time has come for that divine institution to be restored. The\r\nbreach is to be repaired, and the foundation of many generations to be\r\nraised up.\r\n\r\nHallowed by the Creator’s rest and blessing, the Sabbath was kept by Adam\r\nin his innocence in holy Eden; by Adam, fallen yet repentant, when he was\r\ndriven from his happy estate. It was kept by all the patriarchs, from Abel\r\nto righteous Noah, to Abraham, to Jacob. When the chosen people were in\r\nbondage in Egypt, many, in the midst of prevailing idolatry, lost their\r\nknowledge of God’s law; but when the Lord delivered Israel, He proclaimed\r\nHis law in awful grandeur to the assembled multitude, that they might know\r\nHis will, and fear and obey Him forever.\r\n\r\nFrom that day to the present, the knowledge of God’s law has been\r\npreserved in the earth, and the Sabbath of the fourth commandment has been\r\nkept. Though the “man of sin” succeeded in trampling under foot God’s holy\r\nday, yet even in the period of his supremacy there were, hidden in secret\r\nplaces, faithful souls who paid it honor. Since the Reformation, there\r\nhave been some in every generation to maintain its observance. Though\r\noften in the midst of reproach and persecution, a constant testimony has\r\nbeen borne to the perpetuity of the law of God, and the sacred obligation\r\nof the creation Sabbath.\r\n\r\nThese truths, as presented in Revelation 14 in connection with the\r\n“everlasting gospel,” will distinguish the church of Christ at the time of\r\nHis appearing. For as the result of the threefold message it is announced,\r\n“Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”\r\nAnd this message is the last to be given before the coming of the Lord.\r\nImmediately following its proclamation, the Son of man is seen by the\r\nprophet, coming in glory to reap the harvest of the earth.\r\n\r\nThose who received the light concerning the sanctuary and the immutability\r\nof the law of God, were filled with joy and wonder, as they saw the beauty\r\nand harmony of the system of truth that opened to their understanding.\r\nThey desired that the light which appeared to them so precious might be\r\nimparted to all Christians; and they could not but believe that it would\r\nbe joyfully accepted. But truths that would place them at variance with\r\nthe world were not welcome to many who claimed to be followers of Christ.\r\nObedience to the fourth commandment required a sacrifice from which the\r\nmajority drew back.\r\n\r\nAs the claims of the Sabbath were presented, many reasoned from the\r\nworldling’s standpoint. Said they: “We have always kept Sunday, our\r\nfathers kept it, and many good and pious men have died happy while keeping\r\nit. If they were right, so are we. The keeping of this new Sabbath would\r\nthrow us out of harmony with the world, and we would have no influence\r\nover them. What can a little company keeping the seventh day hope to\r\naccomplish against all the world who are keeping Sunday?” It was by\r\nsimilar arguments that the Jews endeavored to justify their rejection of\r\nChrist. Their fathers had been accepted of God in presenting the\r\nsacrificial offerings, and why could not the children find salvation in\r\npursuing the same course? So, in the time of Luther, papists reasoned that\r\ntrue Christians had died in the Catholic faith, and therefore that\r\nreligion was sufficient for salvation. Such reasoning would prove an\r\neffectual barrier to all advancement in religious faith or practice.\r\n\r\nMany urged that Sunday-keeping had been an established doctrine and a\r\nwide-spread custom of the church for many centuries. Against this argument\r\nit was shown that the Sabbath and its observance were more ancient and\r\nwidespread, even as old as the world itself, and bearing the sanction both\r\nof angels and of God. When the foundations of the earth were laid, when\r\nthe morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy,\r\nthen was laid the foundation of the Sabbath.(767) Well may this\r\ninstitution demand our reverence: it was ordained by no human authority,\r\nand rests upon no human traditions; it was established by the Ancient of\r\ndays, and commanded by His eternal word.\r\n\r\nAs the attention of the people was called to the subject of Sabbath\r\nreform, popular ministers perverted the word of God, placing such\r\ninterpretations upon its testimony as would best quiet inquiring minds.\r\nAnd those who did not search the Scriptures for themselves were content to\r\naccept conclusions that were in accordance with their desires. By\r\nargument, sophistry, the traditions of the Fathers, and the authority of\r\nthe church, many endeavored to overthrow the truth. Its advocates were\r\ndriven to their Bibles to defend the validity of the fourth commandment.\r\nHumble men, armed with the Word of truth alone, withstood the attacks of\r\nmen of learning, who, with surprise and anger, found their eloquent\r\nsophistry powerless against the simple, straightforward reasoning of men\r\nwho were versed in the Scriptures rather than in the subtleties of the\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of Bible testimony in their favor, many with unwearying\r\npersistence urged,—forgetting how the same reasoning had been employed\r\nagainst Christ and His apostles,—“Why do not our great men understand this\r\nSabbath question? But few believe as you do. It cannot be that you are\r\nright, and that all the men of learning in the world are wrong.”\r\n\r\nTo refute such arguments it was needful only to cite the teachings of the\r\nScriptures and the history of the Lord’s dealings with His people in all\r\nages. God works through those who hear and obey His voice, those who will,\r\nif need be, speak unpalatable truths, those who do not fear to reprove\r\npopular sins. The reason why He does not oftener choose men of learning\r\nand high position to lead out in reform movements, is that they trust to\r\ntheir creeds, theories, and theological systems, and feel no need to be\r\ntaught of God. Only those who have a personal connection with the Source\r\nof wisdom are able to understand or explain the Scriptures. Men who have\r\nlittle of the learning of the schools are sometimes called to declare the\r\ntruth, not because they are unlearned, but because they are not too\r\nself-sufficient to be taught of God. They learn in the school of Christ,\r\nand their humility and obedience make them great. In committing to them a\r\nknowledge of His truth, God confers upon them an honor, in comparison with\r\nwhich earthly honor and human greatness sink into insignificance.\r\n\r\nThe majority of Adventists rejected the truths concerning the sanctuary\r\nand the law of God, and many also renounced their faith in the Advent\r\nMovement, and adopted unsound and conflicting views of the prophecies\r\nwhich applied to that work. Some were led into the error of repeatedly\r\nfixing upon a definite time for the coming of Christ. The light which was\r\nnow shining on the subject of the sanctuary would have shown them that no\r\nprophetic period extends to the second advent; that the exact time of this\r\nevent is not foretold. But, turning from the light, they continued to set\r\ntime after time for the Lord to come, and as often they were disappointed.\r\n\r\nWhen the Thessalonian church received erroneous views concerning the\r\ncoming of Christ, the apostle Paul counseled them to test their hopes and\r\nanticipations carefully by the word of God. He cited them to prophecies\r\nrevealing the events to take place before Christ should come, and showed\r\nthat they had no ground to expect Him in their day. “Let no man deceive\r\nyou by any means,”(768) are his words of warning. Should they indulge\r\nexpectations that were not sanctioned by the Scriptures, they would be led\r\nto a mistaken course of action; disappointment would expose them to the\r\nderision of unbelievers, and they would be in danger of yielding to\r\ndiscouragement, and would be tempted to doubt the truths essential for\r\ntheir salvation. The apostle’s admonition to the Thessalonians contains an\r\nimportant lesson for those who live in the last days. Many Adventists have\r\nfelt that unless they could fix their faith upon a definite time for the\r\nLord’s coming, they could not be zealous and diligent in the work of\r\npreparation. But as their hopes are again and again excited, only to be\r\ndestroyed, their faith receives such a shock that it becomes well-nigh\r\nimpossible for them to be impressed by the great truths of prophecy.\r\n\r\nThe preaching of a definite time for the judgment, in the giving of the\r\nfirst message, was ordered of God. The computation of the prophetic\r\nperiods on which that message was based, placing the close of the 2300\r\ndays in the autumn of 1844, stands without impeachment. The repeated\r\nefforts to find new dates for the beginning and close of the prophetic\r\nperiods, and the unsound reasoning necessary to sustain these positions,\r\nnot only lead minds away from the present truth, but throw contempt upon\r\nall efforts to explain the prophecies. The more frequently a definite time\r\nis set for the second advent, and the more widely it is taught, the better\r\nit suits the purposes of Satan. After the time has passed, he excites\r\nridicule and contempt of its advocates, and thus casts reproach upon the\r\ngreat Advent Movement of 1843 and 1844. Those who persist in this error\r\nwill at last fix upon a date too far in the future for the coming of\r\nChrist. Thus they will be led to rest in a false security, and many will\r\nnot be undeceived until it is too late.\r\n\r\nThe history of ancient Israel is a striking illustration of the past\r\nexperience of the Adventist body. God led His people in the Advent\r\nMovement, even as He led the children of Israel from Egypt. In the great\r\ndisappointment their faith was tested as was that of the Hebrews at the\r\nRed Sea. Had they still trusted to the guiding hand that had been with\r\nthem in their past experience, they would have seen of the salvation of\r\nGod. If all who had labored unitedly in the work in 1844, had received the\r\nthird angel’s message and proclaimed it in the power of the Holy Spirit,\r\nthe Lord would have wrought mightily with their efforts. A flood of light\r\nwould have been shed upon the world. Years ago the inhabitants of the\r\nearth would have been warned, the closing work completed, and Christ would\r\nhave come for the redemption of His people.\r\n\r\nIt was not the will of God that Israel should wander forty years in the\r\nwilderness; He desired to lead them directly to the land of Canaan, and\r\nestablish them there, a holy, happy people. But “they could not enter in\r\nbecause of unbelief.”(769) Because of their backsliding and apostasy, they\r\nperished in the desert, and others were raised up to enter the promised\r\nland. In like manner, it was not the will of God that the coming of Christ\r\nshould be so long delayed, and His people should remain so many years in\r\nthis world of sin and sorrow. But unbelief separated them from God. As\r\nthey refused to do the work which He had appointed them, others were\r\nraised up to proclaim the message. In mercy to the world, Jesus delays His\r\ncoming, that sinners may have an opportunity to hear the warning, and find\r\nin Him a shelter before the wrath of God shall be poured out.\r\n\r\nNow, as in former ages, the presentation of a truth that reproves the sins\r\nand errors of the times, will excite opposition. “Every one that doeth\r\nevil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should\r\nbe reproved.”(770) As men see that they cannot maintain their position by\r\nthe Scriptures, many determine to maintain it at all hazards, and with a\r\nmalicious spirit they assail the character and motives of those who stand\r\nin defense of unpopular truth. It is the same policy which has been\r\npursued in all ages. Elijah was declared to be a troubler in Israel,\r\nJeremiah a traitor, Paul a polluter of the temple. From that day to this,\r\nthose who would be loyal to truth have been denounced as seditious,\r\nheretical, or schismatic. Multitudes who are too unbelieving to accept the\r\nsure word of prophecy, will receive with unquestioning credulity an\r\naccusation against those who dare to reprove fashionable sins. This spirit\r\nwill increase more and more. And the Bible plainly teaches that a time is\r\napproaching when the laws of the state will so conflict with the law of\r\nGod that whosoever would obey all the divine precepts must brave reproach\r\nand punishment as an evil-doer.\r\n\r\nIn view of this, what is the duty of the messenger of truth? Shall he\r\nconclude that the truth ought not to be presented, since often its only\r\neffect is to arouse men to evade or resist its claims? No; he has no more\r\nreason for withholding the testimony of God’s word, because it excites\r\nopposition, than had earlier reformers. The confession of faith made by\r\nsaints and martyrs was recorded for the benefit of succeeding generations.\r\nThose living examples of holiness and steadfast integrity have come down\r\nto inspire courage in those who are now called to stand as witnesses for\r\nGod. They received grace and truth, not for themselves alone, but that,\r\nthrough them, the knowledge of God might enlighten the earth. Has God\r\ngiven light to His servants in this generation? Then they should let it\r\nshine forth to the world.\r\n\r\nAnciently the Lord declared to one who spoke in His name, “The house of\r\nIsrael will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto Me.”\r\nNevertheless He said, “Thou shalt speak My words unto them, whether they\r\nwill hear, or whether they will forbear.”(771) To the servant of God at\r\nthis time is the command addressed, “Lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and\r\nshow My people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.”\r\n\r\nSo far as his opportunities extend, every one who has received the light\r\nof truth is under the same solemn and fearful responsibility as was the\r\nprophet of Israel, to whom the word of the Lord came, saying: “Son of man,\r\nI have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt\r\nhear the word at My mouth, and warn them from Me. When I say unto the\r\nwicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to\r\nwarn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity;\r\nbut his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the\r\nwicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he\r\nshall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.”(772)\r\n\r\nThe great obstacle both to the acceptance and to the promulgation of\r\ntruth, is the fact that it involves inconvenience and reproach. This is\r\nthe only argument against the truth which its advocates have never been\r\nable to refute. But this does not deter the true followers of Christ.\r\nThese do not wait for truth to become popular. Being convinced of their\r\nduty, they deliberately accept the cross, with the apostle Paul counting\r\nthat “our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a\r\nfar more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;”(773) with one of old,\r\n“esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in\r\nEgypt.”(774)\r\n\r\nWhatever may be their profession, it is only those who are world-servers\r\nat heart that act from policy rather than principle in religious things.\r\nWe should choose the right because it is right, and leave consequences\r\nwith God. To men of principle, faith, and daring, the world is indebted\r\nfor its great reforms. By such men the work of reform for this time must\r\nbe carried forward.\r\n\r\nThus saith the Lord: “Hearken unto Me, ye that know righteousness, the\r\npeople in whose heart is My law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither\r\nbe ye afraid of their revilings. For the moth shall eat them up like a\r\ngarment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but My righteousness shall\r\nbe forever, and My salvation from generation to generation.”(775)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27. MODERN REVIVALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nWherever the word of God has been faithfully preached, results have\r\nfollowed that attested its divine origin. The Spirit of God accompanied\r\nthe message of His servants, and the word was with power. Sinners felt\r\ntheir consciences quickened. The “light which lighteth every man that\r\ncometh into the world,” illumined the secret chambers of their souls, and\r\nthe hidden things of darkness were made manifest. Deep conviction took\r\nhold upon their minds and hearts. They were convinced of sin, and of\r\nrighteousness, and of judgment to come. They had a sense of the\r\nrighteousness of Jehovah, and felt the terror of appearing, in their guilt\r\nand uncleanness, before the Searcher of hearts. In anguish they cried out,\r\n“Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” As the cross of\r\nCalvary, with its infinite sacrifice for the sins of men, was revealed,\r\nthey saw that nothing but the merits of Christ could suffice to atone for\r\ntheir transgressions; this alone could reconcile man to God. With faith\r\nand humility they accepted the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of\r\nthe world. Through the blood of Jesus they had “remission of sins that are\r\npast.”\r\n\r\nThese souls brought forth fruit meet for repentance. They believed and\r\nwere baptized, and rose to walk in newness of life,—new creatures in\r\nChrist Jesus; not to fashion themselves according to the former lusts, but\r\nby the faith of the Son of God to follow in His steps, to reflect His\r\ncharacter, and to purify themselves even as He is pure. The things they\r\nonce hated, they now loved; and the things they once loved, they hated.\r\nThe proud and self-assertive became meek and lowly of heart. The vain and\r\nsupercilious became serious and unobtrusive. The profane became reverent,\r\nthe drunken sober, and the profligate pure. The vain fashions of the world\r\nwere laid aside. Christians sought not the “outward adorning of plaiting\r\nthe hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but ... the\r\nhidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the\r\nornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great\r\nprice.”(776)\r\n\r\nRevivals brought deep heart-searching and humility. They were\r\ncharacterized by solemn, earnest appeals to the sinner, by yearning\r\ncompassion for the purchase of the blood of Christ. Men and women prayed\r\nand wrestled with God for the salvation of souls. The fruits of such\r\nrevivals were seen in souls who shrank not at self-denial and sacrifice,\r\nbut rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer reproach and trial\r\nfor the sake of Christ. Men beheld a transformation in the lives of those\r\nwho had professed the name of Jesus. The community was benefited by their\r\ninfluence. They gathered with Christ, and sowed to the Spirit, to reap\r\nlife everlasting.\r\n\r\nIt could be said of them: “Ye sorrowed to repentance.” “For godly sorrow\r\nworketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of\r\nthe world worketh death. For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed\r\nafter a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing\r\nof yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement\r\ndesire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved\r\nyourselves to be clear in this matter.”(777)\r\n\r\nThis is the result of the work of the Spirit of God. There is no evidence\r\nof genuine repentance unless it works reformation. If he restore the\r\npledge, give again that he had robbed, confess his sins, and love God and\r\nhis fellow-men, the sinner may be sure that he has found peace with God.\r\nSuch were the effects that in former years followed seasons of religious\r\nawakening. Judged by their fruits, they were known to be blessed of God in\r\nthe salvation of men and the uplifting of humanity.\r\n\r\nBut many of the revivals of modern times have presented a marked contrast\r\nto those manifestations of divine grace which in earlier days followed the\r\nlabors of God’s servants. It is true that a wide-spread interest is\r\nkindled, many profess conversion, and there are large accessions to the\r\nchurches; nevertheless the results are not such as to warrant the belief\r\nthat there has been a corresponding increase of real spiritual life. The\r\nlight which flames up for a time soon dies out, leaving the darkness more\r\ndense than before.\r\n\r\nPopular revivals are too often carried by appeals to the imagination, by\r\nexciting the emotions, by gratifying the love for what is new and\r\nstartling. Converts thus gained have little desire to listen to Bible\r\ntruth, little interest in the testimony of prophets and apostles. Unless a\r\nreligious service has something of a sensational character, it has no\r\nattractions for them. A message which appeals to unimpassioned reason\r\nawakens no response. The plain warnings of God’s word, relating directly\r\nto their eternal interests, are unheeded.\r\n\r\nWith every truly converted soul the relation to God and to eternal things\r\nwill be the great topic of life. But where, in the popular churches of\r\nto-day, is the spirit of consecration to God? The converts do not renounce\r\ntheir pride and love of the world. They are no more willing to deny self,\r\nto take up the cross, and follow the meek and lowly Jesus, than before\r\ntheir conversion. Religion has become the sport of infidels and skeptics\r\nbecause so many who bear its name are ignorant of its principles. The\r\npower of godliness has well-nigh departed from many of the churches.\r\nPicnics, church theatricals, church fairs, fine houses, personal display,\r\nhave banished thoughts of God. Lands and goods and worldly occupations\r\nengross the mind, and things of eternal interest receive hardly a passing\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the wide-spread declension of faith and piety, there are\r\ntrue followers of Christ in these churches. Before the final visitation of\r\nGod’s judgments upon the earth, there will be, among the people of the\r\nLord, such a revival of primitive godliness as has not been witnessed\r\nsince apostolic times. The Spirit and power of God will be poured out upon\r\nHis children. At that time many will separate themselves from those\r\nchurches in which the love of this world has supplanted love for God and\r\nHis word. Many, both of ministers and people, will gladly accept those\r\ngreat truths which God has caused to be proclaimed at this time, to\r\nprepare a people for the Lord’s second coming. The enemy of souls desires\r\nto hinder this work; and before the time for such a movement shall come,\r\nhe will endeavor to prevent it, by introducing a counterfeit. In those\r\nchurches which he can bring under his deceptive power, he will make it\r\nappear that God’s special blessing is poured out; there will be manifest\r\nwhat is thought to be great religious interest. Multitudes will exult that\r\nGod is working marvelously for them, when the work is that of another\r\nspirit. Under a religious guise, Satan will seek to extend his influence\r\nover the Christian world.\r\n\r\nIn many of the revivals which have occurred during the last half century,\r\nthe same influences have been at work, to a greater or less degree, that\r\nwill be manifest in the more extensive movements of the future. There is\r\nan emotional excitement, a mingling of the true with the false, that is\r\nwell adapted to mislead. Yet none need be deceived. In the light of God’s\r\nword it is not difficult to determine the nature of these movements.\r\nWherever men neglect the testimony of the Bible, turning away from those\r\nplain, soul-testing truths which require self-denial and renunciation of\r\nthe world, there we may be sure that God’s blessing is not bestowed. And\r\nby the rule which Christ Himself has given, “Ye shall know them by their\r\nfruits,”(778) it is evident that these movements are not the work of the\r\nSpirit of God.\r\n\r\nIn the truths of His word, God has given to men a revelation of Himself;\r\nand to all who accept them they are a shield against the deceptions of\r\nSatan. It is a neglect of these truths that has opened the door to the\r\nevils which are now becoming so wide-spread in the religious world. The\r\nnature and the importance of the law of God have been, to a great extent,\r\nlost sight of. A wrong conception of the character, the perpetuity, and\r\nthe obligation of the divine law, has led to errors in relation to\r\nconversion and sanctification, and has resulted in lowering the standard\r\nof piety in the church. Here is to be found the secret of the lack of the\r\nSpirit and power of God in the revivals of our time.\r\n\r\nThere are, in the various denominations, men eminent for their piety, by\r\nwhom this fact is acknowledged and deplored. Prof. Edwards A. Park, in\r\nsetting forth the current religious perils, ably says: “One source of\r\ndanger is the neglect of the pulpit to enforce the divine law. In former\r\ndays the pulpit was an echo of the voice of conscience.... Our most\r\nillustrious preachers gave a wonderful majesty to their discourses by\r\nfollowing the example of the Master, and giving prominence to the law, its\r\nprecepts, and its threatenings. They repeated the two great maxims, that\r\nthe law is a transcript of the divine perfections, and that a man who does\r\nnot love the law does not love the gospel; for the law, as well as the\r\ngospel, is a mirror reflecting the true character of God. This peril leads\r\nto another, that of underrating the evil of sin, the extent of it, the\r\ndemerit of it. In proportion to the rightfulness of the commandment is the\r\nwrongfulness of disobeying it....\r\n\r\n“Affiliated to the dangers already named is the danger of underestimating\r\nthe justice of God. The tendency of the modern pulpit is to strain out the\r\ndivine justice from the divine benevolence, to sink benevolence into a\r\nsentiment rather than exalt it into a principle. The new theological prism\r\nputs asunder what God has joined together. Is the divine law a good or an\r\nevil? It is a good. Then justice is good; for it is a disposition to\r\nexecute the law. From the habit of underrating the divine law and justice,\r\nthe extent and demerit of human disobedience, men easily slide into the\r\nhabit of underestimating the grace which has provided an atonement for\r\nsin.” Thus the gospel loses its value and importance in the minds of men,\r\nand soon they are ready practically to cast aside the Bible itself.\r\n\r\nMany religious teachers assert that Christ by His death abolished the law,\r\nand men are henceforth free from its requirements. There are some who\r\nrepresent it as a grievous yoke; and in contrast to the bondage of the\r\nlaw, they present the liberty to be enjoyed under the gospel.\r\n\r\nBut not so did prophets and apostles regard the holy law of God. Said\r\nDavid, “I will walk at liberty: for I seek Thy precepts.”(779) The apostle\r\nJames, who wrote after the death of Christ, refers to the decalogue as the\r\n“royal law,” and the “perfect law of liberty.”(780) And the Revelator,\r\nhalf a century after the crucifixion, pronounces a blessing upon them\r\n“that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life,\r\nand may enter in through the gates into the city.”(781)\r\n\r\nThe claim that Christ by His death abolished His Father’s law, is without\r\nfoundation. Had it been possible for the law to be changed or set aside,\r\nthen Christ need not have died to save man from the penalty of sin. The\r\ndeath of Christ, so far from abolishing the law, proves that it is\r\nimmutable. The Son of God came to “magnify the law, and make it\r\nhonorable.”(782) He said, “Think not that I am come to destroy the law;”\r\n“till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass\r\nfrom the law.”(783) And concerning Himself He declares, “I delight to do\r\nThy will, O My God: yea, Thy law is within My heart.”(784)\r\n\r\nThe law of God, from its very nature, is unchangeable. It is a revelation\r\nof the will and the character of its Author. God is love, and His law is\r\nlove. Its two great principles are love to God and love to man. “Love is\r\nthe fulfilling of the law.”(785) The character of God is righteousness and\r\ntruth; such is the nature of His law. Says the psalmist, “Thy law is the\r\ntruth;” “all Thy commandments are righteousness.”(786) And the apostle\r\nPaul declares, “The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and\r\ngood.”(787) Such a law, being an expression of the mind and will of God,\r\nmust be as enduring as its Author.\r\n\r\nIt is the work of conversion and sanctification to reconcile men to God,\r\nby bringing them into accord with the principles of His law. In the\r\nbeginning, man was created in the image of God. He was in perfect harmony\r\nwith the nature and the law of God; the principles of righteousness were\r\nwritten upon his heart. But sin alienated him from his Maker. He no longer\r\nreflected the divine image. His heart was at war with the principles of\r\nGod’s law. “The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject\r\nto the law of God, neither indeed can be.”(788) But “God so loved the\r\nworld, that He gave His only begotten Son,” that man might be reconciled\r\nto God. Through the merits of Christ he can be restored to harmony with\r\nhis Maker. His heart must be renewed by divine grace; he must have a new\r\nlife from above. This change is the new birth, without which, says Jesus,\r\n“he cannot see the kingdom of God.”\r\n\r\nThe first step in reconciliation to God, is the conviction of sin. “Sin is\r\nthe transgression of the law.” “By the law is the knowledge of sin.”(789)\r\nIn order to see his guilt, the sinner must test his character by God’s\r\ngreat standard of righteousness. It is a mirror which shows the perfection\r\nof a righteous character, and enables him to discern the defects in his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThe law reveals to man his sins, but it provides no remedy. While it\r\npromises life to the obedient, it declares that death is the portion of\r\nthe transgressor. The gospel of Christ alone can free him from the\r\ncondemnation or the defilement of sin. He must exercise repentance toward\r\nGod, whose law has been transgressed; and faith in Christ, his atoning\r\nsacrifice. Thus he obtains “remission of sins that are past,” and becomes\r\na partaker of the divine nature. He is a child of God, having received the\r\nspirit of adoption, whereby he cries, “Abba, Father!”\r\n\r\nIs he now free to transgress God’s law? Says Paul: “Do we then make void\r\nthe law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.” “How shall\r\nwe, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?” And John declares,\r\n“This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments: and His\r\ncommandments are not grievous.”(790) In the new birth the heart is brought\r\ninto harmony with God, as it is brought into accord with His law. When\r\nthis mighty change has taken place in the sinner, he has passed from death\r\nunto life, from sin unto holiness, from transgression and rebellion to\r\nobedience and loyalty. The old life of alienation from God has ended; the\r\nnew life of reconciliation, of faith and love, has begun. Then “the\r\nrighteousness of the law” will “be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the\r\nflesh, but after the Spirit.”(791) And the language of the soul will be,\r\n“O how love I Thy law! it is my meditation all the day.”(792)\r\n\r\n“The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.”(793) Without the\r\nlaw, men have no just conception of the purity and holiness of God, or of\r\ntheir own guilt and uncleanness. They have no true conviction of sin, and\r\nfeel no need of repentance. Not seeing their lost condition as violators\r\nof God’s law, they do not realize their need of the atoning blood of\r\nChrist. The hope of salvation is accepted without a radical change of\r\nheart or reformation of life. Thus superficial conversions abound, and\r\nmultitudes are joined to the church who have never been united to Christ.\r\n\r\nErroneous theories of sanctification, also, springing from neglect or\r\nrejection of the divine law, have a prominent place in the religious\r\nmovements of the day. These theories are both false in doctrine and\r\ndangerous in practical results; and the fact that they are so generally\r\nfinding favor, renders it doubly essential that all have a clear\r\nunderstanding of what the Scriptures teach upon this point.\r\n\r\nTrue sanctification is a Bible doctrine. The apostle Paul, in his letter\r\nto the Thessalonian church, declares, “This is the will of God, even your\r\nsanctification.” And he prays, “The very God of peace sanctify you\r\nwholly.”(794) The Bible clearly teaches what sanctification is, and how it\r\nis to be attained. The Saviour prayed for His disciples, “Sanctify them\r\nthrough Thy truth: Thy word is truth.”(795) And Paul teaches that\r\nbelievers are to be “sanctified by the Holy Ghost.”(796) What is the work\r\nof the Holy Spirit? Jesus told His disciples, “When He, the Spirit of\r\ntruth, is come, He will guide you into all truth.”(797) And the psalmist\r\nsays, “Thy law is the truth.” By the word and the Spirit of God are opened\r\nto men the great principles of righteousness embodied in His law. And\r\nsince the law of God is “holy, and just, and good,” a transcript of the\r\ndivine perfection, it follows that a character formed by obedience to that\r\nlaw will be holy. Christ is a perfect example of such a character. He\r\nsays, “I have kept My Father’s commandments.” “I do always those things\r\nthat please Him.”(798) The followers of Christ are to become like Him,—by\r\nthe grace of God to form characters in harmony with the principles of His\r\nholy law. This is Bible sanctification.\r\n\r\nThis work can be accomplished only through faith in Christ, by the power\r\nof the indwelling Spirit of God. Paul admonishes believers, “Work out your\r\nown salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you\r\nboth to will and to do of His good pleasure.”(799) The Christian will feel\r\nthe promptings of sin, but he will maintain a constant warfare against it.\r\nHere is where Christ’s help is needed. Human weakness becomes united to\r\ndivine strength, and faith exclaims, “Thanks be to God, which giveth us\r\nthe victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.”(800)\r\n\r\nThe Scriptures plainly show that the work of sanctification is\r\nprogressive. When in conversion the sinner finds peace with God through\r\nthe blood of the atonement, the Christian life has but just begun. Now he\r\nis to “go on unto perfection;” to grow up “unto the measure of the stature\r\nof the fulness of Christ.” Says the apostle Paul, “This one thing I do,\r\nforgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those\r\nthings which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high\r\ncalling of God in Christ Jesus.”(801) And Peter sets before us the steps\r\nby which Bible sanctification is to be attained: “Giving all diligence,\r\nadd to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge\r\ntemperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to\r\ngodliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.... If ye\r\ndo these things, ye shall never fall.”(802)\r\n\r\nThose who experience the sanctification of the Bible will manifest a\r\nspirit of humility. Like Moses, they have had a view of the awful majesty\r\nof holiness, and they see their own unworthiness in contrast with the\r\npurity and exalted perfection of the Infinite One.\r\n\r\nThe prophet Daniel was an example of true sanctification. His long life\r\nwas filled up with noble service for his Master. He was a man “greatly\r\nbeloved”(803) of Heaven. Yet instead of claiming to be pure and holy, this\r\nhonored prophet identified himself with the really sinful of Israel, as he\r\npleaded before God in behalf of his people: “We do not present our\r\nsupplications before Thee for our righteousnesses, but for Thy great\r\nmercies.” “We have sinned, we have done wickedly.” He declares, “I was\r\nspeaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people.”\r\nAnd when at a later time the Son of God appeared, to give him instruction,\r\nDaniel says, “My comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I\r\nretained no strength.”(804)\r\n\r\nWhen Job heard the voice of the Lord out of the whirlwind, he exclaimed,\r\n“I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.”(805) It was when Isaiah\r\nsaw the glory of the Lord, and heard the cherubim crying, “Holy, holy,\r\nholy, is the Lord of hosts,” that he cried out, “Woe is me! for I am\r\nundone.”(806) Paul, after he was caught up into the third heaven, and\r\nheard things which it was not possible for a man to utter, speaks of\r\nhimself as “less than the least of all saints.”(807) It was the beloved\r\nJohn, who leaned on Jesus’ breast and beheld His glory, that fell as one\r\ndead before the feet of the angel.(808)\r\n\r\nThere can be no self-exaltation, no boastful claim to freedom from sin, on\r\nthe part of those who walk in the shadow of Calvary’s cross. They feel\r\nthat it was their sin which caused the agony that broke the heart of the\r\nSon of God, and this thought will lead them to self-abasement. Those who\r\nlive nearest to Jesus discern most clearly the frailty and sinfulness of\r\nhumanity, and their only hope is in the merit of a crucified and risen\r\nSaviour.\r\n\r\nThe sanctification now gaining prominence in the religious world, carries\r\nwith it a spirit of self-exaltation, and a disregard for the law of God,\r\nthat mark it as foreign to the religion of the Bible. Its advocates teach\r\nthat sanctification is an instantaneous work, by which, through faith\r\nalone, they attain to perfect holiness. “Only believe,” say they, “and the\r\nblessing is yours.” No further effort on the part of the receiver is\r\nsupposed to be required. At the same time they deny the authority of the\r\nlaw of God, urging that they are released from obligation to keep the\r\ncommandments. But is it possible for men to be holy, in accord with the\r\nwill and character of God, without coming into harmony with the principles\r\nwhich are an expression of His nature and will, and which show what is\r\nwell pleasing to Him?\r\n\r\nThe desire for an easy religion, that requires no striving, no\r\nself-denial, no divorce from the follies of the world, has made the\r\ndoctrine of faith, and faith only, a popular doctrine; but what saith the\r\nword of God? Says the apostle James: “What doth it profit, my brethren,\r\nthough a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?...\r\nWilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? Was not\r\nAbraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son\r\nupon the altar? Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works\r\nwas faith made perfect?... Ye see then how that by works a man is\r\njustified, and not by faith only.”(809)\r\n\r\nThe testimony of the word of God is against this ensnaring doctrine of\r\nfaith without works. It is not faith that claims the favor of Heaven\r\nwithout complying with the conditions upon which mercy is to be granted,\r\nit is presumption; for genuine faith has its foundation in the promises\r\nand provisions of the Scriptures.\r\n\r\nLet none deceive themselves with the belief that they can become holy\r\nwhile wilfully violating one of God’s requirements. The commission of a\r\nknown sin silences the witnessing voice of the Spirit, and separates the\r\nsoul from God. “Sin is the transgression of the law.” And “whosoever\r\nsinneth [transgresseth the law] hath not seen Him, neither known\r\nHim.”(810) Though John in his epistles dwells so fully upon love, yet he\r\ndoes not hesitate to reveal the true character of that class who claim to\r\nbe sanctified while living in transgression of the law of God. “He that\r\nsaith, I know Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the\r\ntruth is not in him. But whoso keepeth His word, in him verily is the love\r\nof God perfected.”(811) Here is the test of every man’s profession. We\r\ncannot accord holiness to any man without bringing him to the measurement\r\nof God’s only standard of holiness in heaven and in earth. If men feel no\r\nweight of the moral law, if they belittle and make light of God’s\r\nprecepts, if they break one of the least of these commandments, and teach\r\nmen so, they shall be of no esteem in the sight of Heaven, and we may know\r\nthat their claims are without foundation.\r\n\r\nAnd the claim to be without sin is, in itself, evidence that he who makes\r\nthis claim is far from holy. It is because he has no true conception of\r\nthe infinite purity and holiness of God, or of what they must become who\r\nshall be in harmony with His character; because he has no true conception\r\nof the purity and exalted loveliness of Jesus, and the malignity and evil\r\nof sin, that man can regard himself as holy. The greater the distance\r\nbetween himself and Christ, and the more inadequate his conceptions of the\r\ndivine character and requirements, the more righteous he appears in his\r\nown eyes.\r\n\r\nThe sanctification set forth in the Scriptures embraces the entire\r\nbeing,—spirit, soul, and body. Paul prayed for the Thessalonians, that\r\ntheir “whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the\r\ncoming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”(812) Again he writes to believers, “I\r\nbeseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present\r\nyour bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.”(813) In the\r\ntime of ancient Israel, every offering brought as a sacrifice to God was\r\ncarefully examined. If any defect was discovered in the animal presented,\r\nit was refused; for God had commanded that the offering be “without\r\nblemish.” So Christians are bidden to present their bodies, “a living\r\nsacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.” In order to do this, all their\r\npowers must be preserved in the best possible condition. Every practice\r\nthat weakens physical or mental strength unfits man for the service of his\r\nCreator. And will God be pleased with anything less than the best we can\r\noffer? Said Christ, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart.”\r\nThose who do love God with all the heart will desire to give Him the best\r\nservice of their life, and they will be constantly seeking to bring every\r\npower of their being into harmony with the laws that will promote their\r\nability to do His will. They will not, by the indulgence of appetite or\r\npassion, enfeeble or defile the offering which they present to their\r\nheavenly Father.\r\n\r\nPeter says, “Abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.”(814)\r\nEvery sinful gratification tends to benumb the faculties and deaden the\r\nmental and spiritual perceptions, and the word or the Spirit of God can\r\nmake but a feeble impression upon the heart. Paul writes to the\r\nCorinthians, “Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh\r\nand spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.”(815) And with the\r\nfruits of the Spirit,—“love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness,\r\ngoodness, faith, meekness,”—he classes “temperance.”(816)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these inspired declarations, how many professed Christians\r\nare enfeebling their powers in the pursuit of gain or the worship of\r\nfashion; how many are debasing their godlike manhood by gluttony, by\r\nwine-drinking, by forbidden pleasure. And the church, instead of rebuking,\r\ntoo often encourages the evil by appealing to appetite, to desire for gain\r\nor love of pleasure, to replenish her treasury, which love for Christ is\r\ntoo feeble to supply. Were Jesus to enter the churches of to-day, and\r\nbehold the feasting and unholy traffic there conducted in the name of\r\nreligion, would He not drive out those desecrators, as He banished the\r\nmoney-changers from the temple?\r\n\r\nThe apostle James declares that the wisdom from above is “first pure.” Had\r\nhe encountered those who take the precious name of Jesus upon lips defiled\r\nby tobacco, those whose breath and person are contaminated by its foul\r\nodor, and who pollute the air of heaven, and force all about them to\r\ninhale the poison,—had the apostle come in contact with a practice so\r\nopposed to the purity of the gospel, would he not have denounced it as\r\n“earthly, sensual, devilish”? Slaves of tobacco, claiming the blessing of\r\nentire sanctification, talk of their hope of heaven; but God’s word\r\nplainly declares that “there shall in no wise enter into it anything that\r\ndefileth.”(817)\r\n\r\n“Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in\r\nyou, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? for ye are bought with\r\na price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are\r\nGod’s.”(818) He whose body is the temple of the Holy Spirit will not be\r\nenslaved by a pernicious habit. His powers belong to Christ, who has\r\nbought him with the price of blood. His property is the Lord’s. How could\r\nhe be guiltless in squandering this intrusted capital? Professed\r\nChristians yearly expend an immense sum upon useless and pernicious\r\nindulgences, while souls are perishing for the word of life. God is robbed\r\nin tithes and offerings, while they consume upon the altar of destroying\r\nlust more than they give to relieve the poor or for the support of the\r\ngospel. If all who profess to be followers of Christ were truly\r\nsanctified, their means, instead of being spent for needless and even\r\nhurtful indulgences, would be turned into the Lord’s treasury, and\r\nChristians would set an example of temperance, self-denial, and\r\nself-sacrifice. Then they would be the light of the world.\r\n\r\nThe world is given up to self-indulgence. “The lust of the flesh, the lust\r\nof the eye, and the pride of life,” control the masses of the people. But\r\nChrist’s followers have a holier calling. “Come out from among them, and\r\nbe ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean.” In the light\r\nof God’s word we are justified in declaring that sanctification cannot be\r\ngenuine which does not work this utter renunciation of the sinful pursuits\r\nand gratifications of the world.\r\n\r\nTo those who comply with the conditions, “Come out from among them, and be\r\nye separate, ... and touch not the unclean,” God’s promise is, “I will\r\nreceive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons and\r\ndaughters, saith the Lord Almighty.”(819) It is the privilege and the duty\r\nof every Christian to have a rich and abundant experience in the things of\r\nGod. “I am the light of the world,” said Jesus. “He that followeth Me\r\nshall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.”(820) “The\r\npath of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto\r\nthe perfect day.”(821) Every step of faith and obedience brings the soul\r\ninto closer connection with the Light of the world, in whom “there is no\r\ndarkness at all.” The bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness shine upon\r\nthe servants of God, and they are to reflect His rays. As the stars tell\r\nus that there is a great light in heaven with whose glory they are made\r\nbright, so Christians are to make it manifest that there is a God on the\r\nthrone of the universe whose character is worthy of praise and imitation.\r\nThe graces of His Spirit, the purity and holiness of His character, will\r\nbe manifest in His witnesses.\r\n\r\nPaul, in his letter to the Colossians, sets forth the rich blessings\r\ngranted to the children of God. He says: We “do not cease to pray for you,\r\nand to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of His will in\r\nall wisdom and spiritual understanding; that ye might walk worthy of the\r\nLord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing\r\nin the knowledge of God; strengthened with all might, according to His\r\nglorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with\r\njoyfulness.”(822)\r\n\r\nAgain he writes of his desire that the brethren at Ephesus might come to\r\nunderstand the height of the Christian’s privilege. He opens before them,\r\nin the most comprehensive language, the marvelous power and knowledge that\r\nthey might possess as sons and daughters of the Most High. It was theirs\r\n“to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man,” to be\r\n“rooted and grounded in love,” to “comprehend with all saints what is the\r\nbreadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of\r\nChrist, which passeth knowledge.” But the prayer of the apostle reaches\r\nthe climax of privilege when he prays that “ye might be filled with all\r\nthe fulness of God.”(823)\r\n\r\nHere are revealed the heights of attainment that we may reach through\r\nfaith in the promises of our heavenly Father, when we fulfil His\r\nrequirements. Through the merits of Christ, we have access to the throne\r\nof Infinite Power. “He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up\r\nfor us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all\r\nthings?”(824) The Father gave His Spirit without measure to His Son, and\r\nwe also may partake of its fulness. Jesus says: “If ye then, being evil,\r\nknow how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your\r\nheavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?”(825) “If ye\r\nshall ask anything in My name, I will do it.” “Ask, and ye shall receive,\r\nthat your joy may be full.”(826)\r\n\r\nWhile the Christian’s life will be characterized by humility, it should\r\nnot be marked with sadness and self-depreciation. It is the privilege of\r\nevery one so to live that God will approve and bless him. It is not the\r\nwill of our heavenly Father that we should be ever under condemnation and\r\ndarkness. There is no evidence of true humility in going with the head\r\nbowed down and the heart filled with thoughts of self. We may go to Jesus\r\nand be cleansed, and stand before the law without shame and remorse.\r\n“There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus,\r\nwho walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”(827)\r\n\r\nThrough Jesus the fallen sons of Adam become “sons of God.” “Both He that\r\nsanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one: for which cause\r\nHe is not ashamed to call them brethren.”(828) The Christian’s life should\r\nbe one of faith, of victory, and joy in God. “Whatsoever is born of God\r\novercometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world,\r\neven our faith.”(829) Truly spake God’s servant Nehemiah, “The _joy_ of\r\nthe Lord is your strength.”(830) And Paul says: “Rejoice in the Lord\r\nalway: and again I say, Rejoice.” “Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing.\r\nIn everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus\r\nconcerning you.”(831)\r\n\r\nSuch are the fruits of Bible conversion and sanctification; and it is\r\nbecause the great principles of righteousness set forth in the law of God\r\nare so indifferently regarded by the Christian world, that these fruits\r\nare so rarely witnessed. This is why there is manifest so little of that\r\ndeep, abiding work of the Spirit of God which marked revivals in former\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIt is by beholding that we become changed. And as those sacred precepts in\r\nwhich God has opened to men the perfection and holiness of His character\r\nare neglected, and the minds of the people are attracted to human\r\nteachings and theories, what marvel that there has followed a decline of\r\nliving piety in the church. Saith the Lord, “They have forsaken Me the\r\nfountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns,\r\nthat can hold no water.”(832)\r\n\r\n“Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly.... But\r\nhis delight is in the law of the Lord; and in His law doth he meditate day\r\nand night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,\r\nthat bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not\r\nwither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.”(833) It is only as the law\r\nof God is restored to its rightful position that there can be a revival of\r\nprimitive faith and godliness among His professed people. “Thus saith the\r\nLord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is\r\nthe good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your\r\nsouls.”(834)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28. THE INVESTIGATIVE JUDGMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\n“I beheld,” says the prophet Daniel, “till thrones were placed, and One\r\nthat was ancient of days did sit: His raiment was white as snow, and the\r\nhair of His head like pure wool; His throne was fiery flames, and the\r\nwheels thereof burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from\r\nbefore Him: thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times\r\nten thousand stood before Him: the judgment was set, and the books were\r\nopened.”(835)\r\n\r\nThus was presented to the prophet’s vision the great and solemn day when\r\nthe characters and the lives of men should pass in review before the Judge\r\nof all the earth, and to every man should be rendered “according to his\r\nworks.” The Ancient of days is God the Father. Says the psalmist, “Before\r\nthe mountains were brought forth, or ever Thou hadst formed the earth and\r\nthe world, even from everlasting to everlasting, Thou art God.”(836) It is\r\nHe, the source of all being, and the fountain of all law, that is to\r\npreside in the judgment. And holy angels, as ministers and witnesses, in\r\nnumber “ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,”\r\nattend this great tribunal.\r\n\r\n“And, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and\r\ncame to the Ancient of days, and they brought Him near before Him. And\r\nthere was given Him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people,\r\nnations, and languages, should serve Him: His dominion is an everlasting\r\ndominion, which shall not pass away.”(837) The coming of Christ here\r\ndescribed is not His second coming to the earth. He comes to the Ancient\r\nof days in heaven to receive dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, which\r\nwill be given Him at the close of His work as a mediator. It is this\r\ncoming, and not His second advent to the earth, that was foretold in\r\nprophecy to take place at the termination of the 2300 days in 1844.\r\nAttended by heavenly angels, our great High Priest enters the holy of\r\nholies, and there appears in the presence of God, to engage in the last\r\nacts of His ministration in behalf of man,—to perform the work of\r\ninvestigative judgment, and to make an atonement for all who are shown to\r\nbe entitled to its benefits.\r\n\r\nIn the typical service, only those who had come before God with confession\r\nand repentance, and whose sins, through the blood of the sin-offering,\r\nwere transferred to the sanctuary, had a part in the service of the day of\r\natonement. So in the great day of final atonement and investigative\r\njudgment, the only cases considered are those of the professed people of\r\nGod. The judgment of the wicked is a distinct and separate work, and takes\r\nplace at a later period. “Judgment must begin at the house of God: and if\r\nit first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the\r\ngospel?”(838)\r\n\r\nThe books of record in heaven, in which the names and the deeds of men are\r\nregistered, are to determine the decisions of the judgment. Says the\r\nprophet Daniel, “The judgment was set, and the books were opened.” The\r\nrevelator, describing the same scene, adds, “Another book was opened,\r\nwhich is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things\r\nwhich were written in the books, according to their works.”(839)\r\n\r\nThe book of life contains the names of all who have ever entered the\r\nservice of God. Jesus bade His disciples, “Rejoice, because your names are\r\nwritten in heaven.”(840) Paul speaks of his faithful fellow-workers,\r\n“whose names are in the book of life.”(841) Daniel, looking down to “a\r\ntime of trouble, such as never was,” declares that God’s people shall be\r\ndelivered, “every one that shall be found written in the book.” And the\r\nrevelator says that those only shall enter the city of God whose names\r\n“are written in the Lamb’s book of life.”(842)\r\n\r\n“A book of remembrance” is written before God, in which are recorded the\r\ngood deeds of “them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon His\r\nname.”(843) Their words of faith, their acts of love, are registered in\r\nheaven. Nehemiah refers to this when he says, “Remember me, O my God, ...\r\nand wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my\r\nGod.”(844) In the book of God’s remembrance every deed of righteousness is\r\nimmortalized. There every temptation resisted, every evil overcome, every\r\nword of tender pity expressed, is faithfully chronicled. And every act of\r\nsacrifice, every suffering and sorrow endured for Christ’s sake, is\r\nrecorded. Says the psalmist, “Thou tellest my wanderings: put Thou my\r\ntears into Thy bottle: are they not in Thy book?”(845)\r\n\r\nThere is a record also of the sins of men. “For God shall bring every work\r\ninto judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it\r\nbe evil.” “Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account\r\nthereof in the day of judgment.” Said the Saviour: “By thy words thou\r\nshalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.”(846) The\r\nsecret purposes and motives appear in the unerring register; for God “will\r\nbring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the\r\ncounsels of the hearts.”(847) “Behold, it is written before Me, ... your\r\niniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the\r\nLord.”(848)\r\n\r\nEvery man’s work passes in review before God, and is registered for\r\nfaithfulness or unfaithfulness. Opposite each name in the books of heaven\r\nis entered, with terrible exactness, every wrong word, every selfish act,\r\nevery unfulfilled duty, and every secret sin, with every artful\r\ndissembling. Heaven-sent warnings or reproofs neglected, wasted moments,\r\nunimproved opportunities, the influence exerted for good or for evil, with\r\nits far-reaching results, all are chronicled by the recording angel.\r\n\r\nThe law of God is the standard by which the characters and the lives of\r\nmen will be tested in the judgment. Says the wise man: “Fear God, and keep\r\nHis commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring\r\nevery work into judgment.”(849) The apostle James admonishes his brethren,\r\n“So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of\r\nliberty.”(850)\r\n\r\nThose who in the judgment are “accounted worthy,” will have a part in the\r\nresurrection of the just. Jesus said, “They which shall be accounted\r\nworthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, ... are\r\nequal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of\r\nthe resurrection.”(851) And again He declares that “they that have done\r\ngood” shall come forth “unto the resurrection of life.”(852) The righteous\r\ndead will not be raised until after the judgment at which they are\r\naccounted worthy of “the resurrection of life.” Hence they will not be\r\npresent in person at the tribunal when their records are examined and\r\ntheir cases decided.\r\n\r\nJesus will appear as their advocate, to plead in their behalf before God.\r\n“If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the\r\nrighteous.”(853) “For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with\r\nhands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to\r\nappear in the presence of God for us.” “Wherefore He is able also to save\r\nthem to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to\r\nmake intercession for them.”(854)\r\n\r\nAs the books of record are opened in the judgment, the lives of all who\r\nhave believed on Jesus come in review before God. Beginning with those who\r\nfirst lived upon the earth, our Advocate presents the cases of each\r\nsuccessive generation, and closes with the living. Every name is\r\nmentioned, every case closely investigated. Names are accepted, names\r\nrejected. When any have sins remaining upon the books of record,\r\nunrepented of and unforgiven, their names will be blotted out of the book\r\nof life, and the record of their good deeds will be erased from the book\r\nof God’s remembrance. The Lord declared to Moses, “Whosoever hath sinned\r\nagainst Me, him will I blot out of My book.”(855) And says the prophet\r\nEzekiel, “When the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and\r\ncommitteth iniquity, ... all his righteousness that he hath done shall not\r\nbe mentioned.”(856)\r\n\r\nAll who have truly repented of sin, and by faith claimed the blood of\r\nChrist as their atoning sacrifice, have had pardon entered against their\r\nnames in the books of heaven; as they have become partakers of the\r\nrighteousness of Christ, and their characters are found to be in harmony\r\nwith the law of God, their sins will be blotted out, and they themselves\r\nwill be accounted worthy of eternal life. The Lord declares, by the\r\nprophet Isaiah, “I, even I, am He that blotteth out thy transgressions for\r\nMine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.”(857) Said Jesus: “He that\r\novercometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not\r\nblot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name\r\nbefore My Father, and before His angels.” “Whosoever therefore shall\r\nconfess Me before men, him will I confess also before My Father which is\r\nin heaven. But whosoever shall deny Me before men, him will I also deny\r\nbefore My Father which is in heaven.”(858)\r\n\r\nThe deepest interest manifested among men in the decisions of earthly\r\ntribunals but faintly represents the interest evinced in the heavenly\r\ncourts when the names entered in the book of life come up in review before\r\nthe Judge of all the earth. The divine Intercessor presents the plea that\r\nall who have overcome through faith in His blood be forgiven their\r\ntransgressions, that they be restored to their Eden home, and crowned as\r\njoint-heirs with Himself to the “first dominion.”(859) Satan, in his\r\nefforts to deceive and tempt our race, had thought to frustrate the divine\r\nplan in man’s creation; but Christ now asks that this plan be carried into\r\neffect, as if man had never fallen. He asks for His people not only pardon\r\nand justification, full and complete, but a share in His glory and a seat\r\nupon His throne.\r\n\r\nWhile Jesus is pleading for the subjects of His grace, Satan accuses them\r\nbefore God as transgressors. The great deceiver has sought to lead them\r\ninto skepticism, to cause them to lose confidence in God, to separate\r\nthemselves from His love, and to break His law. Now he points to the\r\nrecord of their lives, to the defects of character, the unlikeness to\r\nChrist, which has dishonored their Redeemer, to all the sins that he has\r\ntempted them to commit, and because of these he claims them as his\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nJesus does not excuse their sins, but shows their penitence and faith,\r\nand, claiming for them forgiveness, He lifts His wounded hands before the\r\nFather and the holy angels, saying, “I know them by name. I have graven\r\nthem on the palms of My hands. ‘The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit:\r\na broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise.’ ”(860) And\r\nto the accuser of His people He declares, “The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan;\r\neven the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand\r\nplucked out of the fire?”(861) Christ will clothe His faithful ones with\r\nHis own righteousness, that He may present them to His Father “a glorious\r\nchurch, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.”(862) Their names\r\nstand enrolled in the book of life, and concerning them it is written,\r\n“They shall walk with Me in white: for they are worthy.”(863)\r\n\r\nThus will be realized the complete fulfilment of the new-covenant promise,\r\n“I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”\r\n“In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the iniquity of Israel\r\nshall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and\r\nthey shall not be found.”(864) “In that day shall the branch of the Lord\r\nbe beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent\r\nand comely for them that are escaped of Israel. And it shall come to pass,\r\nthat he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be\r\ncalled holy, even every one that is written among the living in\r\nJerusalem.”(865)\r\n\r\nThe work of the investigative judgment and the blotting out of sins is to\r\nbe accomplished before the second advent of the Lord. Since the dead are\r\nto be judged out of the things written in the books, it is impossible that\r\nthe sins of men should be blotted out until after the judgment at which\r\ntheir cases are to be investigated. But the apostle Peter distinctly\r\nstates that the sins of believers will be blotted out “when the times of\r\nrefreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and He shall send\r\nJesus Christ.”(866) When the investigative judgment closes, Christ will\r\ncome, and His reward will be with Him to give to every man as his work\r\nshall be.\r\n\r\nIn the typical service the high priest, having made the atonement for\r\nIsrael, came forth and blessed the congregation. So Christ, at the close\r\nof His work as mediator, will appear, “without sin unto salvation,”(867)\r\nto bless His waiting people with eternal life. As the priest, in removing\r\nthe sins from the sanctuary, confessed them upon the head of the\r\nscapegoat, so Christ will place all these sins upon Satan, the originator\r\nand instigator of sin. The scapegoat, bearing the sins of Israel, was sent\r\naway “unto a land not inhabited;”(868) so Satan, bearing the guilt of all\r\nthe sins which he has caused God’s people to commit, will be for a\r\nthousand years confined to the earth, which will then be desolate, without\r\ninhabitant, and he will at last suffer the full penalty of sin in the\r\nfires that shall destroy all the wicked. Thus the great plan of redemption\r\nwill reach its accomplishment in the final eradication of sin, and the\r\ndeliverance of all who have been willing to renounce evil.\r\n\r\nAt the time appointed for the judgment—the close of the 2300 days, in\r\n1844—began the work of investigation and blotting out of sins. All who\r\nhave ever taken upon themselves the name of Christ must pass its searching\r\nscrutiny. Both the living and the dead are to be judged “out of those\r\nthings which were written in the books, according to their works.”\r\n\r\nSins that have not been repented of and forsaken will not be pardoned, and\r\nblotted out of the books of record, but will stand to witness against the\r\nsinner in the day of God. He may have committed his evil deeds in the\r\nlight of day or in the darkness of night; but they were open and manifest\r\nbefore Him with whom we have to do. Angels of God witnessed each sin, and\r\nregistered it in the unerring records. Sin may be concealed, denied,\r\ncovered up from father, mother, wife, children, and associates; no one but\r\nthe guilty actors may cherish the least suspicion of the wrong; but it is\r\nlaid bare before the intelligences of heaven. The darkness of the darkest\r\nnight, the secrecy of all deceptive arts, is not sufficient to veil one\r\nthought from the knowledge of the Eternal. God has an exact record of\r\nevery unjust account and every unfair dealing. He is not deceived by\r\nappearances of piety. He makes no mistakes in His estimation of character.\r\nMen may be deceived by those who are corrupt in heart, but God pierces all\r\ndisguises, and reads the inner life.\r\n\r\nHow solemn is the thought! Day after day, passing into eternity, bears its\r\nburden of records for the books of heaven. Words once spoken, deeds once\r\ndone, can never be recalled. Angels have registered both the good and the\r\nevil. The mightiest conqueror upon the earth cannot call back the record\r\nof even a single day. Our acts, our words, even our most secret motives,\r\nall have their weight in deciding our destiny for weal or woe. Though they\r\nmay be forgotten by us, they will bear their testimony to justify or to\r\ncondemn.\r\n\r\nAs the features of the countenance are reproduced with unerring accuracy\r\non the polished plate of the artist, so the character is faithfully\r\ndelineated in the books above. Yet how little solicitude is felt\r\nconcerning that record which is to meet the gaze of heavenly beings. Could\r\nthe veil which separates the visible from the invisible world be swept\r\nback, and the children of men behold an angel recording every word and\r\ndeed, which they must meet again in the judgment, how many words that are\r\ndaily uttered would remain unspoken; how many deeds would remain undone.\r\n\r\nIn the judgment, the use made of every talent will be scrutinized. How\r\nhave we employed the capital lent us of Heaven? Will the Lord at His\r\ncoming receive His own with usury? Have we improved the powers intrusted\r\nus, in hand and heart and brain, to the glory of God and the blessing of\r\nthe world? How have we used our time, our pen, our voice, our money, our\r\ninfluence? What have we done for Christ, in the person of the poor, the\r\nafflicted, the orphan, or the widow? God has made us the depositaries of\r\nHis holy word; what have we done with the light and truth given us to make\r\nmen wise unto salvation? No value is attached to a mere profession of\r\nfaith in Christ; only the love which is shown by works is counted genuine.\r\nYet it is love alone which in the sight of Heaven makes any act of value.\r\nWhatever is done from love, however small it may appear in the estimation\r\nof men, is accepted and rewarded of God.\r\n\r\nThe hidden selfishness of men stands revealed in the books of heaven.\r\nThere is the record of unfulfilled duties to their fellow-men, of\r\nforgetfulness of the Saviour’s claims. There they will see how often were\r\ngiven to Satan the time, thought, and strength that belonged to Christ.\r\nSad is the record which angels bear to heaven. Intelligent beings,\r\nprofessed followers of Christ, are absorbed in the acquirement of worldly\r\npossessions or the enjoyment of earthly pleasures. Money, time, and\r\nstrength are sacrificed for display and self-indulgence; but few are the\r\nmoments devoted to prayer, to the searching of the Scriptures, to\r\nhumiliation of soul and confession of sin.\r\n\r\nSatan invents unnumbered schemes to occupy our minds, that they may not\r\ndwell upon the very work with which we ought to be best acquainted. The\r\narch-deceiver hates the great truths that bring to view an atoning\r\nsacrifice and an all-powerful Mediator. He knows that with him everything\r\ndepends on his diverting minds from Jesus and His truth.\r\n\r\nThose who would share the benefits of the Saviour’s mediation should\r\npermit nothing to interfere with their duty to perfect holiness in the\r\nfear of God. The precious hours, instead of being given to pleasure, to\r\ndisplay, or to gain-seeking, should be devoted to an earnest, prayerful\r\nstudy of the Word of truth. The subject of the sanctuary and the\r\ninvestigative judgment should be clearly understood by the people of God.\r\nAll need a knowledge for themselves of the position and work of their\r\ngreat High Priest. Otherwise, it will be impossible for them to exercise\r\nthe faith which is essential at this time, or to occupy the position which\r\nGod designs them to fill. Every individual has a soul to save or to lose.\r\nEach has a case pending at the bar of God. Each must meet the great Judge\r\nface to face. How important, then, that every mind contemplate often the\r\nsolemn scene when the judgment shall sit and the books shall be opened,\r\nwhen, with Daniel, every individual must stand in his lot, at the end of\r\nthe days.\r\n\r\nAll who have received the light upon these subjects are to bear testimony\r\nof the great truths which God has committed to them. The sanctuary in\r\nheaven is the very center of Christ’s work in behalf of men. It concerns\r\nevery soul living upon the earth. It opens to view the plan of redemption,\r\nbringing us down to the very close of time, and revealing the triumphant\r\nissue of the contest between righteousness and sin. It is of the utmost\r\nimportance that all should thoroughly investigate these subjects, and be\r\nable to give an answer to every one that asketh them a reason of the hope\r\nthat is in them.\r\n\r\nThe intercession of Christ in man’s behalf in the sanctuary above is as\r\nessential to the plan of salvation as was His death upon the cross. By His\r\ndeath He began that work which after His resurrection He ascended to\r\ncomplete in heaven. We must by faith enter within the veil, “whither the\r\nForerunner is for us entered.”(869) There the light from the cross of\r\nCalvary is reflected. There we may gain a clearer insight into the\r\nmysteries of redemption. The salvation of man is accomplished at an\r\ninfinite expense to heaven; the sacrifice made is equal to the broadest\r\ndemands of the broken law of God. Jesus has opened the way to the Father’s\r\nthrone, and through His mediation the sincere desire of all who come to\r\nHim in faith may be presented before God.\r\n\r\n“He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and\r\nforsaketh them shall have mercy.”(870) If those who hide and excuse their\r\nfaults could see how Satan exults over them, how he taunts Christ and holy\r\nangels with their course, they would make haste to confess their sins and\r\nto put them away. Through defects in the character, Satan works to gain\r\ncontrol of the whole mind, and he knows that if these defects are\r\ncherished, he will succeed. Therefore he is constantly seeking to deceive\r\nthe followers of Christ with his fatal sophistry that it is impossible for\r\nthem to overcome. But Jesus pleads in their behalf His wounded hands, His\r\nbruised body; and He declares to all who would follow Him, “My grace is\r\nsufficient for thee.”(871) “Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I\r\nam meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My\r\nyoke is easy, and My burden is light.”(872) Let none, then, regard their\r\ndefects as incurable. God will give faith and grace to overcome them.\r\n\r\nWe are now living in the great day of atonement. In the typical service,\r\nwhile the high priest was making the atonement for Israel, all were\r\nrequired to afflict their souls by repentance of sin and humiliation\r\nbefore the Lord, lest they be cut off from among the people. In like\r\nmanner, all who would have their names retained in the book of life,\r\nshould now, in the few remaining days of their probation, afflict their\r\nsouls before God by sorrow for sin and true repentance. There must be\r\ndeep, faithful searching of heart. The light, frivolous spirit indulged by\r\nso many professed Christians must be put away. There is earnest warfare\r\nbefore all who would subdue the evil tendencies that strive for the\r\nmastery. The work of preparation is an individual work. We are not saved\r\nin groups. The purity and devotion of one will not offset the want of\r\nthese qualities in another. Though all nations are to pass in judgment\r\nbefore God, yet He will examine the case of each individual with as close\r\nand searching scrutiny as if there were not another being upon the earth.\r\nEvery one must be tested, and found without spot or wrinkle or any such\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nSolemn are the scenes connected with the closing work of the atonement.\r\nMomentous are the interests involved therein. The judgment is now passing\r\nin the sanctuary above. For many years this work has been in progress.\r\nSoon—none know how soon—it will pass to the cases of the living. In the\r\nawful presence of God our lives are to come up in review. At this time\r\nabove all others it behooves every soul to heed the Saviour’s admonition,\r\n“Watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.”(873) “If therefore\r\nthou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not\r\nknow what hour I will come upon thee.”(874)\r\n\r\nWhen the work of the investigative judgment closes, the destiny of all\r\nwill have been decided for life or death. Probation is ended a short time\r\nbefore the appearing of the Lord in the clouds of heaven. Christ in the\r\nRevelation looking forward to that time, declares: “He that is unjust, let\r\nhim be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and\r\nhe that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let\r\nhim be holy still. And, behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me,\r\nto give every man according as his work shall be.”(875)\r\n\r\nThe righteous and the wicked will still be living upon the earth in their\r\nmortal state,—men will be planting and building, eating and drinking, all\r\nunconscious that the final, irrevocable decision has been pronounced in\r\nthe sanctuary above. Before the flood, after Noah entered the ark, God\r\nshut him in, and shut the ungodly out; but for seven days the people,\r\nknowing not that their doom was fixed, continued their careless,\r\npleasure-loving life, and mocked the warnings of impending judgment. “So,”\r\nsays the Saviour, “shall also the coming of the Son of man be.”(876)\r\nSilently, unnoticed as the midnight thief, will come the decisive hour\r\nwhich marks the fixing of every man’s destiny, the final withdrawal of\r\nmercy’s offer to guilty men.\r\n\r\n“Watch ye therefore: ... lest coming suddenly He find you sleeping.”(877)\r\nPerilous is the condition of those who, growing weary of their watch, turn\r\nto the attractions of the world. While the man of business is absorbed in\r\nthe pursuit of gain, while the pleasure-lover is seeking indulgence, while\r\nthe daughter of fashion is arranging her adornments,—it may be in that\r\nhour the Judge of all the earth will pronounce the sentence, “Thou art\r\nweighed in the balances, and art found wanting.”(878)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29. THE ORIGIN OF EVIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nTo many minds, the origin of sin and the reason for its existence are a\r\nsource of great perplexity. They see the work of evil, with its terrible\r\nresults of woe and desolation, and they question how all this can exist\r\nunder the sovereignty of One who is infinite in wisdom, in power, and in\r\nlove. Here is a mystery, of which they find no explanation. And in their\r\nuncertainty and doubt, they are blinded to truths plainly revealed in\r\nGod’s word, and essential to salvation. There are those who, in their\r\ninquiries concerning the existence of sin, endeavor to search into that\r\nwhich God has never revealed; hence they find no solution of their\r\ndifficulties; and such as are actuated by a disposition to doubt and\r\ncavil, seize upon this as an excuse for rejecting the words of Holy Writ.\r\nOthers, however, fail of a satisfactory understanding of the great problem\r\nof evil, from the fact that tradition and misinterpretation have obscured\r\nthe teaching of the Bible concerning the character of God, the nature of\r\nHis government, and the principles of His dealing with sin.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to explain the origin of sin so as to give a reason for\r\nits existence. Yet enough may be understood concerning both the origin and\r\nthe final disposition of sin, to make fully manifest the justice and\r\nbenevolence of God in all His dealings with evil. Nothing is more plainly\r\ntaught in Scripture than that God was in no wise responsible for the\r\nentrance of sin; that there was no arbitrary withdrawal of divine grace,\r\nno deficiency in the divine government, that gave occasion for the\r\nuprising of rebellion. Sin is an intruder, for whose presence no reason\r\ncan be given. It is mysterious, unaccountable; to excuse it, is to defend\r\nit. Could excuse for it be found, or cause be shown for its existence, it\r\nwould cease to be sin. Our only definition of sin is that given in the\r\nword of God; it is “the transgression of the law,” it is the outworking of\r\na principle at war with the great law of love which is the foundation of\r\nthe divine government.\r\n\r\nBefore the entrance of evil, there was peace and joy throughout the\r\nuniverse. All was in perfect harmony with the Creator’s will. Love for God\r\nwas supreme, love for one another impartial. Christ the Word, the only\r\nbegotten of God, was one with the eternal Father,—one in nature, in\r\ncharacter, and in purpose,—the only being in all the universe that could\r\nenter into all the counsels and purposes of God. By Christ, the Father\r\nwrought in the creation of all heavenly beings. “By Him were all things\r\ncreated, that are in heaven, ... whether they be thrones, or dominions, or\r\nprincipalities, or powers;”(879) and to Christ, equally with the Father,\r\nall heaven gave allegiance.\r\n\r\nThe law of love being the foundation of the government of God, the\r\nhappiness of all created beings depended upon their perfect accord with\r\nits great principles of righteousness. God desires from all His creatures\r\nthe service of love,—homage that springs from an intelligent appreciation\r\nof His character. He takes no pleasure in a forced allegiance, and to all\r\nHe grants freedom of will, that they may render Him voluntary service.\r\n\r\nBut there was one that chose to pervert this freedom. Sin originated with\r\nhim who, next to Christ, had been most honored of God, and who stood\r\nhighest in power and glory among the inhabitants of heaven. Before his\r\nfall, Lucifer was first of the covering cherubs, holy and undefiled. “Thus\r\nsaith the Lord God: Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect\r\nin beauty. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone\r\nwas thy covering.” “Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have\r\nset thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up\r\nand down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways\r\nfrom the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in\r\nthee.”(880)\r\n\r\nLucifer might have remained in favor with God, beloved and honored by all\r\nthe angelic host, exercising his noble powers to bless others and to\r\nglorify his Maker. But, says the prophet, “Thine heart was lifted up\r\nbecause of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy\r\nbrightness.”(881) Little by little, Lucifer came to indulge a desire for\r\nself-exaltation. “Thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God.” “Thou\r\nhast said, ... I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit\r\nalso upon the mount of the congregation.... I will ascend above the\r\nheights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.”(882) Instead of\r\nseeking to make God supreme in the affections and allegiance of His\r\ncreatures, it was Lucifer’s endeavor to win their service and homage to\r\nhimself. And coveting the honor which the infinite Father had bestowed\r\nupon His Son, this prince of angels aspired to power which it was the\r\nprerogative of Christ alone to wield.\r\n\r\nAll heaven had rejoiced to reflect the Creator’s glory and to show forth\r\nHis praise. And while God was thus honored, all had been peace and\r\ngladness. But a note of discord now marred the celestial harmonies. The\r\nservice and exaltation of self, contrary to the Creator’s plan, awakened\r\nforebodings of evil in minds to whom God’s glory was supreme. The heavenly\r\ncouncils pleaded with Lucifer. The Son of God presented before him the\r\ngreatness, the goodness, and the justice of the Creator, and the sacred,\r\nunchanging nature of His law. God Himself had established the order of\r\nheaven; and in departing from it, Lucifer would dishonor his Maker, and\r\nbring ruin upon himself. But the warning, given in infinite love and\r\nmercy, only aroused a spirit of resistance. Lucifer allowed jealousy of\r\nChrist to prevail, and he became the more determined.\r\n\r\nPride in his own glory nourished the desire for supremacy. The high honors\r\nconferred upon Lucifer were not appreciated as the gift of God, and called\r\nforth no gratitude to the Creator. He gloried in his brightness and\r\nexaltation, and aspired to be equal with God. He was beloved and\r\nreverenced by the heavenly host. Angels delighted to execute his commands,\r\nand he was clothed with wisdom and glory above them all. Yet the Son of\r\nGod was the acknowledged Sovereign of heaven, one in power and authority\r\nwith the Father. In all the counsels of God, Christ was a participant,\r\nwhile Lucifer was not permitted thus to enter into the divine purposes.\r\n“Why,” questioned this mighty angel, “should Christ have the supremacy?\r\nWhy is He thus honored above Lucifer?”\r\n\r\nLeaving his place in the immediate presence of God, Lucifer went forth to\r\ndiffuse the spirit of discontent among the angels. Working with mysterious\r\nsecrecy, and for a time concealing his real purpose under an appearance of\r\nreverence for God, he endeavored to excite dissatisfaction concerning the\r\nlaws that governed heavenly beings, intimating that they imposed an\r\nunnecessary restraint. Since their natures were holy, he urged that the\r\nangels should obey the dictates of their own will. He sought to create\r\nsympathy for himself, by representing that God had dealt unjustly with him\r\nin bestowing supreme honor upon Christ. He claimed that in aspiring to\r\ngreater power and honor he was not aiming at self-exaltation, but was\r\nseeking to secure liberty for all the inhabitants of heaven, that by this\r\nmeans they might attain to a higher state of existence.\r\n\r\nGod, in His great mercy, bore long with Lucifer. He was not immediately\r\ndegraded from his exalted station when he first indulged the spirit of\r\ndiscontent, nor even when he began to present his false claims before the\r\nloyal angels. Long was he retained in heaven. Again and again he was\r\noffered pardon, on condition of repentance and submission. Such efforts as\r\nonly infinite love and wisdom could devise, were made to convince him of\r\nhis error. The spirit of discontent had never before been known in heaven.\r\nLucifer himself did not at first see whither he was drifting; he did not\r\nunderstand the real nature of his feelings. But as his dissatisfaction was\r\nproved to be without cause, Lucifer was convinced that he was in the\r\nwrong, that the divine claims were just, and that he ought to acknowledge\r\nthem as such before all heaven. Had he done this, he might have saved\r\nhimself and many angels. He had not at this time fully cast off his\r\nallegiance to God. Though he had forsaken his position as covering cherub,\r\nyet if he had been willing to return to God, acknowledging the Creator’s\r\nwisdom, and satisfied to fill the place appointed him in God’s great plan,\r\nhe would have been re-instated in his office. But pride forbade him to\r\nsubmit. He persistently defended his own course, maintained that he had no\r\nneed of repentance, and fully committed himself, in the great controversy,\r\nagainst his Maker.\r\n\r\nAll the powers of his master-mind were now bent to the work of deception,\r\nto secure the sympathy of the angels that had been under his command. Even\r\nthe fact that Christ had warned and counseled him, was perverted to serve\r\nhis traitorous designs. To those whose loving trust bound them most\r\nclosely to him, Satan had represented that he was wrongly judged, that his\r\nposition was not respected, and that his liberty was to be abridged. From\r\nmisrepresentation of the words of Christ, he passed to prevarication and\r\ndirect falsehood, accusing the Son of God of a design to humiliate him\r\nbefore the inhabitants of heaven. He sought also to make a false issue\r\nbetween himself and the loyal angels. All whom he could not subvert and\r\nbring fully to his side, he accused of indifference to the interests of\r\nheavenly beings. The very work which he himself was doing, he charged upon\r\nthose who remained true to God. And to sustain his charge of God’s\r\ninjustice toward him, he resorted to misrepresentation of the words and\r\nacts of the Creator. It was his policy to perplex the angels with subtle\r\narguments concerning the purposes of God. Everything that was simple he\r\nshrouded in mystery, and by artful perversion cast doubt upon the plainest\r\nstatements of Jehovah. His high position, in such close connection with\r\nthe divine administration, gave greater force to his representations, and\r\nmany were induced to unite with him in rebellion against Heaven’s\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nGod in His wisdom permitted Satan to carry forward his work, until the\r\nspirit of disaffection ripened into active revolt. It was necessary for\r\nhis plans to be fully developed, that their true nature and tendency might\r\nbe seen by all. Lucifer, as the anointed cherub, had been highly exalted;\r\nhe was greatly loved by the heavenly beings, and his influence over them\r\nwas strong. God’s government included not only the inhabitants of heaven,\r\nbut of all the worlds that He had created; and Satan thought that if he\r\ncould carry the angels of heaven with him in rebellion, he could carry\r\nalso the other worlds. He had artfully presented his side of the question,\r\nemploying sophistry and fraud to secure his objects. His power to deceive\r\nwas very great, and by disguising himself in a cloak of falsehood he had\r\ngained an advantage. Even the loyal angels could not fully discern his\r\ncharacter, or see to what his work was leading.\r\n\r\nSatan had been so highly honored, and all his acts were so clothed with\r\nmystery, that it was difficult to disclose to the angels the true nature\r\nof his work. Until fully developed, sin would not appear the evil thing it\r\nwas. Heretofore it had had no place in the universe of God, and holy\r\nbeings had no conception of its nature and malignity. They could not\r\ndiscern the terrible consequences that would result from setting aside the\r\ndivine law. Satan had, at first, concealed his work under a specious\r\nprofession of loyalty to God. He claimed to be seeking to promote the\r\nhonor of God, the stability of His government, and the good of all the\r\ninhabitants of heaven. While instilling discontent into the minds of the\r\nangels under him, he had artfully made it appear that he was seeking to\r\nremove dissatisfaction. When he urged that changes be made in the order\r\nand laws of God’s government, it was under the pretense that these were\r\nnecessary in order to preserve harmony in heaven.\r\n\r\nIn His dealing with sin, God could employ only righteousness and truth.\r\nSatan could use what God could not—flattery and deceit. He had sought to\r\nfalsify the word of God, and had misrepresented His plan of government\r\nbefore the angels, claiming that God was not just in laying laws and rules\r\nupon the inhabitants of heaven; that in requiring submission and obedience\r\nfrom His creatures, He was seeking merely the exaltation of Himself.\r\nTherefore it must be demonstrated before the inhabitants of heaven, as\r\nwell as of all the worlds, that God’s government was just, His law\r\nperfect. Satan had made it appear that he himself was seeking to promote\r\nthe good of the universe. The true character of the usurper, and his real\r\nobject, must be understood by all. He must have time to manifest himself\r\nby his wicked works.\r\n\r\nThe discord which his own course had caused in heaven, Satan charged upon\r\nthe law and government of God. All evil he declared to be the result of\r\nthe divine administration. He claimed that it was his own object to\r\nimprove upon the statutes of Jehovah. Therefore it was necessary that he\r\nshould demonstrate the nature of his claims, and show the working out of\r\nhis proposed changes in the divine law. His own work must condemn him.\r\nSatan had claimed from the first that he was not in rebellion. The whole\r\nuniverse must see the deceiver unmasked.\r\n\r\nEven when it was decided that he could no longer remain in heaven,\r\nInfinite Wisdom did not destroy Satan. Since the service of love can alone\r\nbe acceptable to God, the allegiance of His creatures must rest upon a\r\nconviction of His justice and benevolence. The inhabitants of heaven and\r\nof other worlds, being unprepared to comprehend the nature or consequences\r\nof sin, could not then have seen the justice and mercy of God in the\r\ndestruction of Satan. Had he been immediately blotted from existence, they\r\nwould have served God from fear, rather than from love. The influence of\r\nthe deceiver would not have been fully destroyed, nor would the spirit of\r\nrebellion have been utterly eradicated. Evil must be permitted to come to\r\nmaturity. For the good of the entire universe through ceaseless ages,\r\nSatan must more fully develop his principles, that his charges against the\r\ndivine government might be seen in their true light by all created beings,\r\nthat the justice and mercy of God and the immutability of His law might\r\nforever be placed beyond all question.\r\n\r\nSatan’s rebellion was to be a lesson to the universe through all coming\r\nages, a perpetual testimony to the nature and terrible results of sin. The\r\nworking out of Satan’s rule, its effects upon both men and angels, would\r\nshow what must be the fruit of setting aside the divine authority. It\r\nwould testify that with the existence of God’s government and His law is\r\nbound up the well-being of all the creatures He has made. Thus the history\r\nof this terrible experiment of rebellion was to be a perpetual safeguard\r\nto all holy intelligences, to prevent them from being deceived as to the\r\nnature of transgression, to save them from committing sin and suffering\r\nits punishment.\r\n\r\nTo the very close of the controversy in heaven, the great usurper\r\ncontinued to justify himself. When it was announced that with all his\r\nsympathizers he must be expelled from the abodes of bliss, then the rebel\r\nleader boldly avowed his contempt for the Creator’s law. He reiterated his\r\nclaim that angels needed no control, but should be left to follow their\r\nown will, which would ever guide them right. He denounced the divine\r\nstatutes as a restriction of their liberty, and declared that it was his\r\npurpose to secure the abolition of law; that, freed from this restraint,\r\nthe hosts of heaven might enter upon a more exalted, more glorious state\r\nof existence.\r\n\r\nWith one accord, Satan and his host threw the blame of their rebellion\r\nwholly upon Christ, declaring that if they had not been reproved, they\r\nwould never have rebelled. Thus stubborn and defiant in their disloyalty,\r\nseeking vainly to overthrow the government of God, yet blasphemously\r\nclaiming to be themselves the innocent victims of oppressive power, the\r\narch-rebel and all his sympathizers were at last banished from heaven.\r\n\r\nThe same spirit that prompted rebellion in heaven, still inspires\r\nrebellion on earth. Satan has continued with men the same policy which he\r\npursued with the angels. His spirit now reigns in the children of\r\ndisobedience. Like him they seek to break down the restraints of the law\r\nof God, and promise men liberty through transgression of its precepts.\r\nReproof of sin still arouses the spirit of hatred and resistance. When\r\nGod’s messages of warning are brought home to the conscience, Satan leads\r\nmen to justify themselves, and to seek the sympathy of others in their\r\ncourse of sin. Instead of correcting their errors, they excite indignation\r\nagainst the reprover, as if he were the sole cause of difficulty. From the\r\ndays of righteous Abel to our own time, such is the spirit which has been\r\ndisplayed toward those who dare to condemn sin.\r\n\r\nBy the same misrepresentation of the character of God as he had practised\r\nin heaven, causing Him to be regarded as severe and tyrannical, Satan\r\ninduced man to sin. And having succeeded thus far, he declared that God’s\r\nunjust restrictions had led to man’s fall, as they had led to his own\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nBut the Eternal One Himself proclaims His character: “The Lord God,\r\nmerciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,\r\nkeeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin,\r\nand that will by no means clear the guilty.”(883)\r\n\r\nIn the banishment of Satan from heaven, God declared His justice, and\r\nmaintained the honor of His throne. But when man had sinned through\r\nyielding to the deceptions of this apostate spirit, God gave an evidence\r\nof His love by yielding up His only begotten Son to die for the fallen\r\nrace. In the atonement the character of God is revealed. The mighty\r\nargument of the cross demonstrates to the whole universe that the course\r\nof sin which Lucifer had chosen was in no wise chargeable upon the\r\ngovernment of God.\r\n\r\nIn the contest between Christ and Satan, during the Saviour’s earthly\r\nministry, the character of the great deceiver was unmasked. Nothing could\r\nso effectually have uprooted Satan from the affections of the heavenly\r\nangels and the whole loyal universe, as did his cruel warfare upon the\r\nworld’s Redeemer. The daring blasphemy of his demand that Christ should\r\npay him homage, his presumptuous boldness in bearing Him to the mountain\r\nsummit and the pinnacle of the temple, the malicious intent betrayed in\r\nurging Him to cast Himself down from the dizzy height, the unsleeping\r\nmalice that hunted Him from place to place, inspiring the hearts of\r\npriests and people to reject His love, and at the last to cry, “Crucify\r\nHim! crucify Him!”—all this excited the amazement and indignation of the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nIt was Satan that prompted the world’s rejection of Christ. The prince of\r\nevil exerted all his power and cunning to destroy Jesus; for he saw that\r\nthe Saviour’s mercy and love, His compassion and pitying tenderness, were\r\nrepresenting to the world the character of God. Satan contested every\r\nclaim put forth by the Son of God, and employed men as his agents to fill\r\nthe Saviour’s life with suffering and sorrow. The sophistry and falsehood\r\nby which he had sought to hinder the work of Jesus, the hatred manifested\r\nthrough the children of disobedience, his cruel accusations against Him\r\nwhose life was one of unexampled goodness, all sprung from deep-seated\r\nrevenge. The pent-up fires of envy and malice, hatred and revenge, burst\r\nforth on Calvary against the Son of God, while all heaven gazed upon the\r\nscene in silent horror.\r\n\r\nWhen the great sacrifice had been consummated, Christ ascended on high,\r\nrefusing the adoration of angels until He had presented the request, “I\r\nwill that they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am.”(884)\r\nThen with inexpressible love and power came forth the answer from the\r\nFather’s throne, “Let all the angels of God worship Him.”(885) Not a stain\r\nrested upon Jesus. His humiliation ended, His sacrifice completed, there\r\nwas given unto Him a name that is above every name.\r\n\r\nNow the guilt of Satan stood forth without excuse. He had revealed his\r\ntrue character as a liar and a murderer. It was seen that the very same\r\nspirit with which he ruled the children of men, who were under his power,\r\nhe would have manifested had he been permitted to control the inhabitants\r\nof heaven. He had claimed that the transgression of God’s law would bring\r\nliberty and exaltation; but it was seen to result in bondage and\r\ndegradation.\r\n\r\nSatan’s lying charges against the divine character and government appeared\r\nin their true light. He had accused God of seeking merely the exaltation\r\nof Himself in requiring submission and obedience from His creatures, and\r\nhad declared that while the Creator exacted self-denial from all others,\r\nHe Himself practised no self-denial and made no sacrifice. Now it was seen\r\nthat for the salvation of a fallen and sinful race, the Ruler of the\r\nuniverse had made the greatest sacrifice which love could make; for “God\r\nwas in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself.”(886) It was seen,\r\nalso, that while Lucifer had opened the door for the entrance of sin, by\r\nhis desire for honor and supremacy, Christ had, in order to destroy sin,\r\nhumbled Himself, and become obedient unto death.\r\n\r\nGod had manifested His abhorrence of the principles of rebellion. All\r\nheaven saw His justice revealed, both in the condemnation of Satan and in\r\nthe redemption of man. Lucifer had declared that if the law of God was\r\nchangeless, and its penalty could not be remitted, every transgressor must\r\nbe forever debarred from the Creator’s favor. He had claimed that the\r\nsinful race were placed beyond redemption, and were therefore his rightful\r\nprey. But the death of Christ was an argument in man’s behalf that could\r\nnot be overthrown. The penalty of the law fell upon Him who was equal with\r\nGod, and man was free to accept the righteousness of Christ, and by a life\r\nof penitence and humiliation to triumph, as the Son of God had triumphed,\r\nover the power of Satan. Thus God is just, and yet the justifier of all\r\nwho believe in Jesus.\r\n\r\nBut it was not merely to accomplish the redemption of man that Christ came\r\nto the earth to suffer and to die. He came to “magnify the law” and to\r\n“make it honorable.” Not alone that the inhabitants of this world might\r\nregard the law as it should be regarded; but it was to demonstrate to all\r\nthe worlds of the universe that God’s law is unchangeable. Could its\r\nclaims have been set aside, then the Son of God need not have yielded up\r\nHis life to atone for its transgression. The death of Christ proves it\r\nimmutable. And the sacrifice to which infinite love impelled the Father\r\nand the Son, that sinners might be redeemed, demonstrates to all the\r\nuniverse—what nothing less than this plan of atonement could have sufficed\r\nto do—that justice and mercy are the foundation of the law and government\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nIn the final execution of the judgment it will be seen that no cause for\r\nsin exists. When the Judge of all the earth shall demand of Satan, “Why\r\nhast thou rebelled against Me, and robbed Me of the subjects of My\r\nkingdom?” the originator of evil can render no excuse. Every mouth will be\r\nstopped, and all the hosts of rebellion will be speechless.\r\n\r\nThe cross of Calvary, while it declares the law immutable, proclaims to\r\nthe universe that the wages of sin is death. In the Saviour’s expiring\r\ncry, “It is finished,” the death-knell of Satan was rung. The great\r\ncontroversy which had been so long in progress was then decided, and the\r\nfinal eradication of evil was made certain. The Son of God passed through\r\nthe portals of the tomb, that “through death He might destroy him that had\r\nthe power of death, that is, the devil.”(887) Lucifer’s desire for\r\nself-exaltation had led him to say, “I will exalt my throne above the\r\nstars of God: ... I will be like the Most High.” God declares, “I will\r\nbring thee to ashes upon the earth, ... and never shalt thou be any\r\nmore.”(888) When “the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven, ... all the\r\nproud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that\r\ncometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave\r\nthem neither root nor branch.”(889)\r\n\r\nThe whole universe will have become witnesses to the nature and results of\r\nsin. And its utter extermination, which in the beginning would have\r\nbrought fear to angels and dishonor to God, will now vindicate His love\r\nand establish His honor before the universe of beings who delight to do\r\nHis will, and in whose heart is His law. Never will evil again be\r\nmanifest. Says the word of God, “Affliction shall not rise up the second\r\ntime.”(890) The law of God, which Satan has reproached as the yoke of\r\nbondage, will be honored as the law of liberty. A tested and proved\r\ncreation will never again be turned from allegiance to Him whose character\r\nhas been fully manifested before them as fathomless love and infinite\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30. ENMITY BETWEEN MAN AND SATAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\n“I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and\r\nher seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.”(891)\r\nThe divine sentence pronounced against Satan after the fall of man, was\r\nalso a prophecy, embracing all the ages to the close of time, and\r\nforeshadowing the great conflict to engage all the races of men who should\r\nlive upon the earth.\r\n\r\nGod declares, “I will put enmity.” This enmity is not naturally\r\nentertained. When man transgressed the divine law, his nature became evil,\r\nand he was in harmony, and not at variance, with Satan. There exists\r\nnaturally no enmity between sinful man and the originator of sin. Both\r\nbecame evil through apostasy. The apostate is never at rest, except as he\r\nobtains sympathy and support by inducing others to follow his example. For\r\nthis reason, fallen angels and wicked men unite in desperate\r\ncompanionship. Had not God specially interposed, Satan and man would have\r\nentered into an alliance against Heaven; and instead of cherishing enmity\r\nagainst Satan, the whole human family would have been united in opposition\r\nto God.\r\n\r\nSatan tempted man to sin, as he had caused angels to rebel, that he might\r\nthus secure co-operation in his warfare against Heaven. There was no\r\ndissension between himself and the fallen angels as regards their hatred\r\nof Christ; while on all other points there was discord, they were firmly\r\nunited in opposing the authority of the Ruler of the universe. But when\r\nSatan heard the declaration that enmity should exist between himself and\r\nthe woman, and between his seed and her seed, he knew that his efforts to\r\ndeprave human nature would be interrupted; that by some means man was to\r\nbe enabled to resist his power.\r\n\r\nSatan’s enmity against the human race is kindled, because, through Christ,\r\nthey are the objects of God’s love and mercy. He desires to thwart the\r\ndivine plan for man’s redemption, to cast dishonor upon God, by defacing\r\nand defiling His handiwork; he would cause grief in heaven, and fill the\r\nearth with woe and desolation. And he points to all this evil as the\r\nresult of God’s work in creating man.\r\n\r\nIt is the grace that Christ implants in the soul which creates in man\r\nenmity against Satan. Without this converting grace and renewing power,\r\nman would continue the captive of Satan, a servant ever ready to do his\r\nbidding. But the new principle in the soul creates conflict where hitherto\r\nhad been peace. The power which Christ imparts, enables man to resist the\r\ntyrant and usurper. Whoever is seen to abhor sin instead of loving it,\r\nwhoever resists and conquers those passions that have held sway within,\r\ndisplays the operation of a principle wholly from above.\r\n\r\nThe antagonism that exists between the spirit of Christ and the spirit of\r\nSatan was most strikingly displayed in the world’s reception of Jesus. It\r\nwas not so much because He appeared without worldly wealth, pomp, or\r\ngrandeur, that the Jews were led to reject Him. They saw that He possessed\r\npower which would more than compensate for the lack of these outward\r\nadvantages. But the purity and holiness of Christ called forth against Him\r\nthe hatred of the ungodly. His life of self-denial and sinless devotion\r\nwas a perpetual reproof to a proud, sensual people. It was this that\r\nevoked enmity against the Son of God. Satan and evil angels joined with\r\nevil men. All the energies of apostasy conspired against the Champion of\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThe same enmity is manifested toward Christ’s followers as was manifested\r\ntoward their Master. Whoever sees the repulsive character of sin, and in\r\nstrength from above resists temptation, will assuredly arouse the wrath of\r\nSatan and his subjects. Hatred of the pure principles of truth, and\r\nreproach and persecution of its advocates, will exist as long as sin and\r\nsinners remain. The followers of Christ and the servants of Satan cannot\r\nharmonize. The offense of the cross has not ceased. “All that will live\r\ngodly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.”(892)\r\n\r\nSatan’s agents are constantly working under his direction to establish his\r\nauthority and build up his kingdom in opposition to the government of God.\r\nTo this end they seek to deceive Christ’s followers, and allure them from\r\ntheir allegiance. Like their leader, they misconstrue and pervert the\r\nScriptures to accomplish their object. As Satan endeavored to cast\r\nreproach upon God, so do his agents seek to malign God’s people. The\r\nspirit which put Christ to death moves the wicked to destroy His\r\nfollowers. All this is foreshadowed in that first prophecy, “I will put\r\nenmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed.” And\r\nthis will continue to the close of time.\r\n\r\nSatan summons all his forces, and throws his whole power into the combat.\r\nWhy is it that he meets with no greater resistance? Why are the soldiers\r\nof Christ so sleepy and indifferent? Because they have so little real\r\nconnection with Christ; because they are so destitute of His Spirit. Sin\r\nis not to them repulsive and abhorrent, as it was to their Master. They do\r\nnot meet it, as did Christ, with decisive and determined resistance. They\r\ndo not realize the exceeding evil and malignity of sin, and they are\r\nblinded both to the character and the power of the prince of darkness.\r\nThere is little enmity against Satan and his works, because there is so\r\ngreat ignorance concerning his power and malice, and the vast extent of\r\nhis warfare against Christ and His church. Multitudes are deluded here.\r\nThey do not know that their enemy is a mighty general, who controls the\r\nminds of evil angels, and that with well-matured plans and skilful\r\nmovements he is warring against Christ to prevent the salvation of souls.\r\nAmong professed Christians, and even among ministers of the gospel, there\r\nis heard scarcely a reference to Satan, except perhaps an incidental\r\nmention in the pulpit. They overlook the evidences of his continual\r\nactivity and success; they neglect the many warnings of his subtlety; they\r\nseem to ignore his very existence.\r\n\r\nWhile men are ignorant of his devices, this vigilant foe is upon their\r\ntrack every moment. He is intruding his presence in every department of\r\nthe household, in every street of our cities, in the churches, in the\r\nnational councils, in the courts of justice, perplexing, deceiving,\r\nseducing, everywhere ruining the souls and bodies of men, women, and\r\nchildren, breaking up families, sowing hatred, emulation, strife,\r\nsedition, murder. And the Christian world seem to regard these things as\r\nthough God had appointed them, and they must exist.\r\n\r\nSatan is continually seeking to overcome the people of God by breaking\r\ndown the barriers which separate them from the world. Ancient Israel were\r\nenticed into sin when they ventured into forbidden association with the\r\nheathen. In a similar manner are modern Israel led astray. “The god of\r\nthis world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the\r\nlight of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should\r\nshine unto them.”(893) All who are not decided followers of Christ are\r\nservants of Satan. In the unregenerate heart there is love of sin, and a\r\ndisposition to cherish and excuse it. In the renewed heart there is hatred\r\nof sin, and determined resistance against it. When Christians choose the\r\nsociety of the ungodly and unbelieving, they expose themselves to\r\ntemptation. Satan conceals himself from view, and stealthily draws his\r\ndeceptive covering over their eyes. They cannot see that such company is\r\ncalculated to do them harm; and while all the time assimilating to the\r\nworld in character, words, and actions, they are becoming more and more\r\nblinded.\r\n\r\nConformity to worldly customs converts the church to the world; it never\r\nconverts the world to Christ. Familiarity with sin will inevitably cause\r\nit to appear less repulsive. He who chooses to associate with the servants\r\nof Satan, will soon cease to fear their master. When in the way of duty we\r\nare brought into trial, as was Daniel in the king’s court, we may be sure\r\nthat God will protect us; but if we place ourselves under temptation, we\r\nshall fall sooner or later.\r\n\r\nThe tempter often works most successfully through those who are least\r\nsuspected of being under his control. The possessors of talent and\r\neducation are admired and honored, as if these qualities could atone for\r\nthe absence of the fear of God, or entitle men to His favor. Talent and\r\nculture, considered in themselves, are gifts of God; but when these are\r\nmade to supply the place of piety, when, instead of bringing the soul\r\nnearer to God, they lead away from Him, then they become a curse and a\r\nsnare. The opinion prevails with many that all which appears like courtesy\r\nor refinement must, in some sense, pertain to Christ. Never was there a\r\ngreater mistake. These qualities should grace the character of every\r\nChristian, for they would exert a powerful influence in favor of true\r\nreligion; but they must be consecrated to God, or they also are a power\r\nfor evil. Many a man of cultured intellect and pleasant manners, who would\r\nnot stoop to what is commonly regarded as an immoral act, is but a\r\npolished instrument in the hands of Satan. The insidious, deceptive\r\ncharacter of his influence and example renders him a more dangerous enemy\r\nto the cause of Christ than are those who are ignorant and uncultured.\r\n\r\nBy earnest prayer and dependence upon God, Solomon obtained the wisdom\r\nwhich excited the wonder and admiration of the world. But when he turned\r\nfrom the Source of his strength, and went forward relying upon himself, he\r\nfell a prey to temptation. Then the marvelous powers bestowed on this\r\nwisest of kings, only rendered him a more effective agent of the adversary\r\nof souls.\r\n\r\nWhile Satan is constantly seeking to blind their minds to the fact, let\r\nChristians never forget that they “wrestle not against flesh and blood,\r\nbut against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the\r\ndarkness of this world, against wicked spirits in high places.”(894) The\r\ninspired warning is sounding down the centuries to our time: “Be sober, be\r\nvigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh\r\nabout, seeking whom he may devour.”(895) “Put on the whole armor of God,\r\nthat ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.”(896)\r\n\r\nFrom the days of Adam to our own time, our great enemy has been exercising\r\nhis power to oppress and destroy. He is now preparing for his last\r\ncampaign against the church. All who seek to follow Jesus will be brought\r\ninto conflict with this relentless foe. The more nearly the Christian\r\nimitates the divine Pattern, the more surely will he make himself a mark\r\nfor the attacks of Satan. All who are actively engaged in the cause of\r\nGod, seeking to unveil the deceptions of the evil one and to present\r\nChrist before the people, will be able to join in the testimony of Paul,\r\nin which he speaks of serving the Lord with all humility of mind, with\r\nmany tears and temptations.\r\n\r\nSatan assailed Christ with his fiercest and most subtle temptations; but\r\nhe was repulsed in every conflict. Those battles were fought in our\r\nbehalf; those victories make it possible for us to conquer. Christ will\r\ngive strength to all who seek it. No man without his own consent can be\r\novercome by Satan. The tempter has no power to control the will or to\r\nforce the soul to sin. He may distress, but he cannot contaminate. He can\r\ncause agony, but not defilement. The fact that Christ has conquered should\r\ninspire His followers with courage to fight manfully the battle against\r\nsin and Satan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31. AGENCY OF EVIL SPIRITS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nThe connection of the visible with the invisible world, the ministration\r\nof angels of God, and the agency of evil spirits, are plainly revealed in\r\nthe Scriptures, and inseparably interwoven with human history. There is a\r\ngrowing tendency to disbelief in the existence of evil spirits, while the\r\nholy angels that “minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation,”(897)\r\nare regarded by many as the spirits of the dead. But the Scriptures not\r\nonly teach the existence of angels, both good and evil, but present\r\nunquestionable proof that these are not the disembodied spirits of dead\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nBefore the creation of man, angels were in existence; for when the\r\nfoundations of the earth were laid, “the morning stars sang together, and\r\nall the sons of God shouted for joy.”(898) After the fall of man, angels\r\nwere sent to guard the tree of life, and this before a human being had\r\ndied. Angels are in nature superior to men; for the psalmist says that man\r\nwas made “a little lower than the angels.”(899)\r\n\r\nWe are informed in Scripture as to the number, and the power and glory, of\r\nthe heavenly beings, of their connection with the government of God, and\r\nalso of their relation to the work of redemption. “The Lord hath prepared\r\nHis throne in the heavens; and His kingdom ruleth over all.” And, says the\r\nprophet, “I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne.” In the\r\npresence-chamber of the King of kings they wait—“angels, that excel in\r\nstrength,” “ministers of His, that do His pleasure,” “hearkening unto the\r\nvoice of His word.”(900) Ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of\r\nthousands, were the heavenly messengers beheld by the prophet Daniel. The\r\napostle Paul declared them “an innumerable company.”(901) As God’s\r\nmessengers they go forth, like “the appearance of a flash of\r\nlightning,”(902) so dazzling their glory, and so swift their flight. The\r\nangel that appeared at the Saviour’s tomb, his countenance “like\r\nlightning, and his raiment white as snow,” caused the keepers for fear of\r\nhim to quake, and they “became as dead men.”(903) When Sennacherib, the\r\nhaughty Assyrian, reproached and blasphemed God, and threatened Israel\r\nwith destruction, “it came to pass that night, that the angel of the Lord\r\nwent out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and\r\nfive thousand.” There were “cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the\r\nleaders and captains,” from the army of Sennacherib. “So he returned with\r\nshame of face to his own land.”(904)\r\n\r\nAngels are sent on missions of mercy to the children of God. To Abraham,\r\nwith promises of blessing; to the gates of Sodom, to rescue righteous Lot\r\nfrom its fiery doom; to Elijah, as he was about to perish from weariness\r\nand hunger in the desert; to Elisha, with chariots and horses of fire\r\nsurrounding the little town where he was shut in by his foes; to Daniel,\r\nwhile seeking divine wisdom in the court of a heathen king, or abandoned\r\nto become the lions’ prey; to Peter, doomed to death in Herod’s dungeon;\r\nto the prisoners at Philippi; to Paul and his companions in the night of\r\ntempest on the sea; to open the mind of Cornelius to receive the gospel;\r\nto dispatch Peter with the message of salvation to the Gentile\r\nstranger,—thus holy angels have, in all ages, ministered to God’s people.\r\n\r\nA guardian angel is appointed to every follower of Christ. These heavenly\r\nwatchers shield the righteous from the power of the wicked one. This Satan\r\nhimself recognized when he said, “Doth Job fear God for naught? Hast not\r\nThou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he\r\nhath on every side?”(905) The agency by which God protects His people is\r\npresented in the words of the psalmist, “The angel of the Lord encampeth\r\nround about them that fear Him, and delivereth them.”(906) Said the\r\nSaviour, speaking of those that believe in Him, “Take heed that ye despise\r\nnot one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their\r\nangels do always behold the face of My Father.”(907) The angels appointed\r\nto minister to the children of God have at all times access to His\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nThus God’s people, exposed to the deceptive power and unsleeping malice of\r\nthe prince of darkness, and in conflict with all the forces of evil, are\r\nassured of the unceasing guardianship of heavenly angels. Nor is such\r\nassurance given without need. If God has granted to His children promise\r\nof grace and protection, it is because there are mighty agencies of evil\r\nto be met,—agencies numerous, determined, and untiring, of whose malignity\r\nand power none can safely be ignorant or unheeding.\r\n\r\nEvil spirits, in the beginning created sinless, were equal in nature,\r\npower, and glory with the holy beings that are now God’s messengers. But\r\nfallen through sin, they are leagued together for the dishonor of God and\r\nthe destruction of men. United with Satan in his rebellion, and with him\r\ncast out from heaven, they have, through all succeeding ages, co-operated\r\nwith him in his warfare against the divine authority. We are told in\r\nScripture of their confederacy and government, of their various orders, of\r\ntheir intelligence and subtlety, and of their malicious designs against\r\nthe peace and happiness of men.\r\n\r\nOld Testament history presents occasional mentions of their existence and\r\nagency; but it was during the time when Christ was upon the earth that\r\nevil spirits manifested their power in the most striking manner. Christ\r\nhad come to enter upon the plan devised for man’s redemption, and Satan\r\ndetermined to assert his right to control the world. He had succeeded in\r\nestablishing idolatry in every part of the earth except the land of\r\nPalestine. To the only land that had not fully yielded to the tempter’s\r\nsway, Christ came to shed upon the people the light of heaven. Here two\r\nrival powers claimed supremacy. Jesus was stretching out His arms of love,\r\ninviting all who would to find pardon and peace in Him. The hosts of\r\ndarkness saw that they did not possess unlimited control, and they\r\nunderstood that if Christ’s mission should be successful, their rule was\r\nsoon to end. Satan raged like a chained lion, and defiantly exhibited his\r\npower over the bodies as well as the souls of men.\r\n\r\nThe fact that men have been possessed with demons, is clearly stated in\r\nthe New Testament. The persons thus afflicted were not merely suffering\r\nwith disease from natural causes. Christ had perfect understanding of that\r\nwith which He was dealing, and He recognized the direct presence and\r\nagency of evil spirits.\r\n\r\nA striking example of their number, power, and malignity, and also of the\r\npower and mercy of Christ, is given in the Scripture account of the\r\nhealing of the demoniacs at Gadara. Those wretched maniacs, spurning all\r\nrestraint, writhing, foaming, raging, were filling the air with their\r\ncries, doing violence to themselves, and endangering all who should\r\napproach them. Their bleeding and disfigured bodies and distracted minds\r\npresented a spectacle well-pleasing to the prince of darkness. One of the\r\ndemons controlling the sufferers declared, “My name is Legion: for we are\r\nmany.”(908) In the Roman army a legion consisted of from three to five\r\nthousand men. Satan’s hosts also are marshaled in companies, and the\r\nsingle company to which these demons belonged numbered no less than a\r\nlegion.\r\n\r\nAt the command of Jesus, the evil spirits departed from their victims,\r\nleaving them calmly sitting at the Saviour’s feet, subdued, intelligent,\r\nand gentle. But the demons were permitted to sweep a herd of swine into\r\nthe sea; and to the dwellers of Gadara the loss of these outweighed the\r\nblessings which Christ had bestowed, and the divine Healer was entreated\r\nto depart. This was the result which Satan designed to secure. By casting\r\nthe blame of their loss upon Jesus, he aroused the selfish fears of the\r\npeople, and prevented them from listening to His words. Satan is\r\nconstantly accusing Christians as the cause of loss, misfortune, and\r\nsuffering, instead of allowing the reproach to fall where it belongs,—upon\r\nhimself and his agents.\r\n\r\nBut the purposes of Christ were not thwarted. He allowed the evil spirits\r\nto destroy the herd of swine as a rebuke to those Jews who were raising\r\nthese unclean beasts for the sake of gain. Had not Christ restrained the\r\ndemons, they would have plunged into the sea, not only the swine, but also\r\ntheir keepers and owners. The preservation of both the keepers and the\r\nowners was due alone to His power, mercifully exercised for their\r\ndeliverance. Furthermore, this event was permitted to take place that the\r\ndisciples might witness the cruel power of Satan upon both man and beast.\r\nThe Saviour desired His followers to have a knowledge of the foe whom they\r\nwere to meet, that they might not be deceived and overcome by his devices.\r\nIt was also His will that the people of that region should behold His\r\npower to break the bondage of Satan and release his captives. And though\r\nJesus Himself departed, the men so marvelously delivered, remained to\r\ndeclare the mercy of their Benefactor.\r\n\r\nOther instances of a similar nature are recorded in the Scriptures. The\r\ndaughter of the Syro-Phenician woman was grievously vexed with a devil,\r\nwhom Jesus cast out by His word.(909) One “possessed with a devil, blind,\r\nand dumb;”(910) a youth who had a dumb spirit, that ofttimes “cast him\r\ninto the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him;”(911) the maniac who,\r\ntormented by “a spirit of an unclean devil,”(912) disturbed the Sabbath\r\nquiet of the synagogue at Capernaum,—all were healed by the compassionate\r\nSaviour. In nearly every instance, Christ addressed the demon as an\r\nintelligent entity, commanding him to come out of his victim and to\r\ntorment him no more. The worshipers at Capernaum, beholding His mighty\r\npower, “were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, ‘What a word\r\nis this! for with authority and power He commandeth the unclean spirits,\r\nand they come out.’ ”(913)\r\n\r\nThose possessed with devils are usually represented as being in a\r\ncondition of great suffering; yet there were exceptions to this rule. For\r\nthe sake of obtaining supernatural power, some welcomed the satanic\r\ninfluence. These of course had no conflict with the demons. Of this class\r\nwere those who possessed the spirit of divination,—Simon Magus, Elymas the\r\nsorcerer, and the damsel who followed Paul and Silas at Philippi.\r\n\r\nNone are in greater danger from the influence of evil spirits than those\r\nwho, notwithstanding the direct and ample testimony of the Scriptures,\r\ndeny the existence and agency of the devil and his angels. So long as we\r\nare ignorant of their wiles, they have almost inconceivable advantage;\r\nmany give heed to their suggestions while they suppose themselves to be\r\nfollowing the dictates of their own wisdom. This is why, as we approach\r\nthe close of time, when Satan is to work with greatest power to deceive\r\nand destroy, he spreads everywhere the belief that he does not exist. It\r\nis his policy to conceal himself and his manner of working.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing that the great deceiver fears so much as that we shall\r\nbecome acquainted with his devices. The better to disguise his real\r\ncharacter and purposes, he has caused himself to be so represented as to\r\nexcite no stronger emotion than ridicule or contempt. He is well pleased\r\nto be painted as a ludicrous or loathsome object, misshapen, half animal\r\nand half human. He is pleased to hear his name used in sport and mockery\r\nby those who think themselves intelligent and well informed.\r\n\r\nIt is because he has masked himself with consummate skill that the\r\nquestion is so widely asked, “Does such a being really exist?” It is an\r\nevidence of his success that theories giving the lie to the plainest\r\ntestimony of the Scriptures are so generally received in the religious\r\nworld. And it is because Satan can most readily control the minds of those\r\nwho are unconscious of his influence, that the word of God gives us so\r\nmany examples of his malignant work, unveiling before us his secret\r\nforces, and thus placing us on our guard against his assaults.\r\n\r\nThe power and malice of Satan and his host might justly alarm us, were it\r\nnot that we may find shelter and deliverance in the superior power of our\r\nRedeemer. We carefully secure our houses with bolts and locks to protect\r\nour property and our lives from evil men; but we seldom think of the evil\r\nangels who are constantly seeking access to us, and against whose attacks\r\nwe have, in our own strength, no method of defense. If permitted, they can\r\ndistract our minds, disorder and torment our bodies, destroy our\r\npossessions and our lives. Their only delight is in misery and\r\ndestruction. Fearful is the condition of those who resist the divine\r\nclaims, and yield to Satan’s temptations, until God gives them up to the\r\ncontrol of evil spirits. But those who follow Christ are ever safe under\r\nHis watchcare. Angels that excel in strength are sent from heaven to\r\nprotect them. The wicked one cannot break through the guard which God has\r\nstationed about His people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n32. SNARES OF SATAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nThe great controversy between Christ and Satan, that has been carried\r\nforward for nearly six thousand years, is soon to close; and the wicked\r\none redoubles his efforts to defeat the work of Christ in man’s behalf,\r\nand to fasten souls in his snares. To hold the people in darkness and\r\nimpenitence till the Saviour’s mediation is ended, and there is no longer\r\na sacrifice for sin, is the object which he seeks to accomplish.\r\n\r\nWhen there is no special effort made to resist his power, when\r\nindifference prevails in the church and the world, Satan is not concerned;\r\nfor he is in no danger of losing those whom he is leading captive at his\r\nwill. But when the attention is called to eternal things, and souls are\r\ninquiring, “What must I do to be saved?” he is on the ground, seeking to\r\nmatch his power against the power of Christ, and to counteract the\r\ninfluence of the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Scriptures declare that upon one occasion, when the angels of God came\r\nto present themselves before the Lord, Satan came also among them,(914)\r\nnot to bow before the Eternal King, but to further his own malicious\r\ndesigns against the righteous. With the same object he is in attendance\r\nwhen men assemble for the worship of God. Though hidden from sight, he is\r\nworking with all diligence to control the minds of the worshipers. Like a\r\nskilful general, he lays his plans beforehand. As he sees the messenger of\r\nGod searching the Scriptures, he takes note of the subject to be presented\r\nto the people. Then he employs all his cunning and shrewdness so to\r\ncontrol circumstances that the message may not reach those whom he is\r\ndeceiving on that very point. The one who most needs the warning will be\r\nurged into some business transaction which requires his presence, or will\r\nby some other means be prevented from hearing the words that might prove\r\nto him a savor of life unto life.\r\n\r\nAgain, Satan sees the Lord’s servants burdened because of the spiritual\r\ndarkness that enshrouds the people. He hears their earnest prayers for\r\ndivine grace and power to break the spell of indifference, carelessness,\r\nand indolence. Then with renewed zeal he plies his arts. He tempts men to\r\nthe indulgence of appetite or to some other form of self-gratification,\r\nand thus benumbs their sensibilities, so that they fail to hear the very\r\nthings which they most need to learn.\r\n\r\nSatan well knows that all whom he can lead to neglect prayer and the\r\nsearching of the Scriptures, will be overcome by his attacks. Therefore he\r\ninvents every possible device to engross the mind. There has ever been a\r\nclass professing godliness, who, instead of following on to know the\r\ntruth, make it their religion to seek some fault of character or error of\r\nfaith in those with whom they do not agree. Such are Satan’s right-hand\r\nhelpers. Accusers of the brethren are not few; and they are always active\r\nwhen God is at work, and His servants are rendering Him true homage. They\r\nwill put a false coloring upon the words and acts of those who love and\r\nobey the truth. They will represent the most earnest, zealous,\r\nself-denying servants of Christ as deceived or deceivers. It is their work\r\nto misrepresent the motives of every true and noble deed, to circulate\r\ninsinuations, and arouse suspicion in the minds of the inexperienced. In\r\nevery conceivable manner they will seek to cause that which is pure and\r\nrighteous to be regarded as foul and deceptive.\r\n\r\nBut none need be deceived concerning them. It may be readily seen whose\r\nchildren they are, whose example they follow, and whose work they do. “Ye\r\nshall know them by their fruits.”(915) Their course resembles that of\r\nSatan, the envenomed slanderer, “the accuser of our brethren.”(916)\r\n\r\nThe great deceiver has many agents ready to present any and every kind of\r\nerror to ensnare souls,—heresies prepared to suit the varied tastes and\r\ncapacities of those whom he would ruin. It is his plan to bring into the\r\nchurch insincere, unregenerate elements that will encourage doubt and\r\nunbelief, and hinder all who desire to see the work of God advance, and to\r\nadvance with it. Many who have no real faith in God or in His word, assent\r\nto some principles of truth, and pass as Christians; and thus they are\r\nenabled to introduce their errors as scriptural doctrines.\r\n\r\nThe position that it is of no consequence what men believe, is one of\r\nSatan’s most successful deceptions. He knows that the truth, received in\r\nthe love of it, sanctifies the soul of the receiver; therefore he is\r\nconstantly seeking to substitute false theories, fables, another gospel.\r\nFrom the beginning, the servants of God have contended against false\r\nteachers, not merely as vicious men, but as inculcators of falsehoods that\r\nwere fatal to the soul. Elijah, Jeremiah, Paul, firmly and fearlessly\r\nopposed those who were turning men from the word of God. That liberality\r\nwhich regards a correct religious faith as unimportant, found no favor\r\nwith these holy defenders of the truth.\r\n\r\nThe vague and fanciful interpretations of Scripture, and the many\r\nconflicting theories concerning religious faith, that are found in the\r\nChristian world, are the work of our great adversary, to confuse minds so\r\nthat they shall not discern the truth. And the discord and division which\r\nexist among the churches of Christendom are in a great measure due to the\r\nprevailing custom of wresting the Scriptures to support a favorite theory.\r\nInstead of carefully studying God’s word with humility of heart to obtain\r\na knowledge of His will, many seek only to discover something odd or\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nIn order to sustain erroneous doctrines or unchristian practices, some\r\nwill seize upon passages of Scripture separated from the context, perhaps\r\nquoting half of a single verse as proving their point, when the remaining\r\nportion would show the meaning to be quite the opposite. With the cunning\r\nof the serpent, they entrench themselves behind disconnected utterances\r\nconstrued to suit their carnal desires. Thus do many wilfully pervert the\r\nword of God. Others, who have an active imagination, seize upon the\r\nfigures and symbols of Holy Writ, interpret them to suit their fancy, with\r\nlittle regard to the testimony of Scripture as its own interpreter, and\r\nthen they present their vagaries as the teachings of the Bible.\r\n\r\nWhenever the study of the Scriptures is entered upon without a prayerful,\r\nhumble, teachable spirit, the plainest and simplest as well as the most\r\ndifficult passages will be wrested from their true meaning. The papal\r\nleaders select such portions of Scripture as best serve their purpose,\r\ninterpret to suit themselves, and then present these to the people, while\r\nthey deny them the privilege of studying the Bible and understanding its\r\nsacred truths for themselves. The whole Bible should be given to the\r\npeople just as it reads. It would be better for them not to have Bible\r\ninstruction at all, than to have the teaching of the Scriptures thus\r\ngrossly misrepresented.\r\n\r\nThe Bible was designed to be a guide to all who wish to become acquainted\r\nwith the will of their Maker. God gave to men the sure word of prophecy;\r\nangels and even Christ Himself came to make known to Daniel and John the\r\nthings that must shortly come to pass. Those important matters that\r\nconcern our salvation were not left involved in mystery. They were not\r\nrevealed in such a way as to perplex and mislead the honest seeker after\r\ntruth. Said the Lord by the prophet Habakkuk, “Write the vision, and make\r\nit plain, ... that he may run that readeth it.”(917) The word of God is\r\nplain to all who study it with a prayerful heart. Every truly honest soul\r\nwill come to the light of truth. “Light is sown for the righteous.”(918)\r\nAnd no church can advance in holiness unless its members are earnestly\r\nseeking for truth as for hid treasure.\r\n\r\nBy the cry, Liberality, men are blinded to the devices of their adversary,\r\nwhile he is all the time working steadily for the accomplishment of his\r\nobject. As he succeeds in supplanting the Bible by human speculations, the\r\nlaw of God is set aside, and the churches are under the bondage of sin\r\nwhile they claim to be free.\r\n\r\nTo many, scientific research has become a curse. God has permitted a flood\r\nof light to be poured upon the world in discoveries in science and art;\r\nbut even the greatest minds, if not guided by the word of God in their\r\nresearch, become bewildered in their attempts to investigate the relations\r\nof science and revelation.\r\n\r\nHuman knowledge of both material and spiritual things is partial and\r\nimperfect; therefore many are unable to harmonize their views of science\r\nwith Scripture statements. Many accept mere theories and speculations as\r\nscientific facts, and they think that God’s word is to be tested by the\r\nteachings of “science falsely so called.”(919) The Creator and His works\r\nare beyond their comprehension; and because they cannot explain these by\r\nnatural laws, Bible history is regarded as unreliable. Those who doubt the\r\nreliability of the records of the Old and New Testaments, too often go a\r\nstep farther, and doubt the existence of God, and attribute infinite power\r\nto nature. Having let go their anchor, they are left to beat about upon\r\nthe rocks of infidelity.\r\n\r\nThus many err from the faith, and are seduced by the devil. Men have\r\nendeavored to be wiser than their Creator; human philosophy has attempted\r\nto search out and explain mysteries which will never be revealed, through\r\nthe eternal ages. If men would but search and understand what God has made\r\nknown of Himself and His purposes, they would obtain such a view of the\r\nglory, majesty, and power of Jehovah, that they would realize their own\r\nlittleness, and would be content with that which has been revealed for\r\nthemselves and their children.\r\n\r\nIt is a masterpiece of Satan’s deceptions to keep the minds of men\r\nsearching and conjecturing in regard to that which God has not made known,\r\nand which He does not intend that we shall understand. It was thus that\r\nLucifer lost his place in heaven. He became dissatisfied because all the\r\nsecrets of God’s purposes were not confided to him, and he entirely\r\ndisregarded that which was revealed concerning his own work in the lofty\r\nposition assigned him. By arousing the same discontent in the angels under\r\nhis command, he caused their fall. Now he seeks to imbue the minds of men\r\nwith the same spirit, and to lead them also to disregard the direct\r\ncommands of God.\r\n\r\nThose who are unwilling to accept the plain, cutting truths of the Bible,\r\nare continually seeking for pleasing fables that will quiet the\r\nconscience. The less spiritual, self-denying, and humiliating the\r\ndoctrines presented, the greater the favor with which they are received.\r\nThese persons degrade the intellectual powers to serve their carnal\r\ndesires. Too wise in their own conceit to search the Scriptures with\r\ncontrition of soul and earnest prayer for divine guidance, they have no\r\nshield from delusion. Satan is ready to supply the heart’s desire, and he\r\npalms off his deceptions in the place of truth. It was thus that the\r\npapacy gained its power over the minds of men; and by rejection of the\r\ntruth because it involves a cross, Protestants are following the same\r\npath. All who neglect the word of God to study convenience and policy,\r\nthat they may not be at variance with the world, will be left to receive\r\ndamnable heresy for religious truth. Every conceivable form of error will\r\nbe accepted by those who wilfully reject the truth. He who looks with\r\nhorror upon one deception will readily receive another. The apostle Paul,\r\nspeaking of a class who “received not the love of the truth, that they\r\nmight be saved,” declares, “For this cause God shall send them strong\r\ndelusion, that they should believe a lie: that they all might be damned\r\nwho believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.”(920)\r\nWith such a warning before us, it behooves us to be on our guard as to\r\nwhat doctrines we receive.\r\n\r\nAmong the most successful agencies of the great deceiver are the delusive\r\nteachings and lying wonders of Spiritualism. Disguised as an angel of\r\nlight, he spreads his nets where least suspected. If men would but study\r\nthe Book of God with earnest prayer that they might understand it, they\r\nwould not be left in darkness to receive false doctrines. But as they\r\nreject the truth, they fall a prey to deception.\r\n\r\nAnother dangerous error is the doctrine that denies the deity of Christ,\r\nclaiming that He had no existence before His advent to this world. This\r\ntheory is received with favor by a large class who profess to believe the\r\nBible; yet it directly contradicts the plainest statements of our Saviour\r\nconcerning His relationship with the Father, His divine character, and His\r\npre-existence. It cannot be entertained without the most unwarranted\r\nwresting of the Scriptures. It not only lowers man’s conceptions of the\r\nwork of redemption, but undermines faith in the Bible as a revelation from\r\nGod. While this renders it the more dangerous, it makes it also harder to\r\nmeet. If men reject the testimony of the inspired Scriptures concerning\r\nthe deity of Christ, it is in vain to argue the point with them; for no\r\nargument, however conclusive, could convince them. “The natural man\r\nreceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness\r\nunto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually\r\ndiscerned.”(921) None who hold this error can have a true conception of\r\nthe character or the mission of Christ, or of the great plan of God for\r\nman’s redemption.\r\n\r\nStill another subtle and mischievous error is the fast-spreading belief\r\nthat Satan has no existence as a personal being; that the name is used in\r\nScripture merely to represent men’s evil thoughts and desires.\r\n\r\nThe teaching so widely echoed from popular pulpits, that the second advent\r\nof Christ is His coming to each individual at death, is a device to divert\r\nthe minds of men from His personal coming in the clouds of heaven. For\r\nyears Satan has thus been saying, “Behold, He is in the secret\r\nchambers,”(922) and many souls have been lost by accepting this deception.\r\n\r\nAgain, worldly wisdom teaches that prayer is not essential. Men of science\r\nclaim that there can be no real answer to prayer; that this would be a\r\nviolation of law, a miracle, and that miracles have no existence. The\r\nuniverse, say they, is governed by fixed laws, and God Himself does\r\nnothing contrary to these laws. Thus they represent God as bound by His\r\nown laws—as if the operation of divine laws could exclude divine freedom.\r\nSuch teaching is opposed to the testimony of the Scriptures. Were not\r\nmiracles wrought by Christ and His apostles? The same compassionate\r\nSaviour lives to-day, and He is as willing to listen to the prayer of\r\nfaith as when He walked visibly among men. The natural co-operates with\r\nthe supernatural. It is a part of God’s plan to grant us, in answer to the\r\nprayer of faith, that which He would not bestow did we not thus ask.\r\n\r\nInnumerable are the erroneous doctrines and fanciful ideas that are\r\nobtaining among the churches of Christendom. It is impossible to estimate\r\nthe evil results of removing one of the landmarks fixed by the word of\r\nGod. Few who venture to do this stop with the rejection of a single truth.\r\nThe majority continue to set aside one after another of the principles of\r\ntruth, until they become actual infidels.\r\n\r\nThe errors of popular theology have driven many a soul to skepticism, who\r\nmight otherwise have been a believer in the Scriptures. It is impossible\r\nfor him to accept doctrines which outrage his sense of justice, mercy, and\r\nbenevolence: and since these are represented as the teaching of the Bible,\r\nhe refuses to receive it as the word of God.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the object which Satan seeks to accomplish. There is nothing\r\nthat he desires more than to destroy confidence in God and in His word.\r\nSatan stands at the head of the great army of doubters, and he works to\r\nthe utmost of his power to beguile souls into his ranks. It is becoming\r\nfashionable to doubt. There is a large class by whom the word of God is\r\nlooked upon with distrust for the same reason as was its Author,—because\r\nit reproves and condemns sin. Those who are unwilling to obey its\r\nrequirements, endeavor to overthrow its authority. They read the Bible, or\r\nlisten to its teachings as presented from the sacred desk, merely to find\r\nfault with the Scriptures or with the sermon. Not a few become infidels in\r\norder to justify or excuse themselves in neglect of duty. Others adopt\r\nskeptical principles from pride and indolence. Too ease-loving to\r\ndistinguish themselves by accomplishing anything worthy of honor, which\r\nrequires effort and self-denial, they aim to secure a reputation for\r\nsuperior wisdom by criticising the Bible. There is much which the finite\r\nmind, unenlightened by divine wisdom, is powerless to comprehend; and thus\r\nthey find occasion to criticise. There are many who seem to feel that it\r\nis a virtue to stand on the side of unbelief, skepticism, and infidelity.\r\nBut underneath an appearance of candor, it will be found that such persons\r\nare actuated by self-confidence and pride. Many delight in finding\r\nsomething in the Scriptures to puzzle the minds of others. Some at first\r\ncriticise and reason on the wrong side, from a mere love of controversy.\r\nThey do not realize that they are thus entangling themselves in the snare\r\nof the fowler. But having openly expressed unbelief, they feel that they\r\nmust maintain their position. Thus they unite with the ungodly, and close\r\nto themselves the gates of Paradise.\r\n\r\nGod has given in His word sufficient evidence of its divine character. The\r\ngreat truths which concern our redemption are clearly presented. By the\r\naid of the Holy Spirit, which is promised to all who seek it in sincerity,\r\nevery man may understand these truths for himself. God has granted to men\r\na strong foundation upon which to rest their faith.\r\n\r\nYet the finite minds of men are inadequate fully to comprehend the plans\r\nand purposes of the Infinite One. We can never by searching find out God.\r\nWe must not attempt to lift with presumptuous hand the curtain behind\r\nwhich He veils His majesty. The apostle exclaims, “How unsearchable are\r\nHis judgments, and His ways past finding out!”(923) We can so far\r\ncomprehend His dealings with us, and the motives by which He is actuated,\r\nthat we may discern boundless love and mercy united to infinite power. Our\r\nFather in heaven orders everything in wisdom and righteousness, and we are\r\nnot to be dissatisfied and distrustful, but to bow in reverent submission.\r\nHe will reveal to us as much of His purposes as it is for our good to\r\nknow, and beyond that we must trust the Hand that is omnipotent, the Heart\r\nthat is full of love.\r\n\r\nWhile God has given ample evidence for faith, He will never remove all\r\nexcuse for unbelief. All who look for hooks to hang their doubts upon,\r\nwill find them. And those who refuse to accept and obey God’s word until\r\nevery objection has been removed, and there is no longer an opportunity\r\nfor doubt, will never come to the light.\r\n\r\nDistrust of God is the natural outgrowth of the unrenewed heart, which is\r\nat enmity with Him. But faith is inspired by the Holy Spirit, and it will\r\nflourish only as it is cherished. No man can become strong in faith\r\nwithout a determined effort. Unbelief strengthens as it is encouraged; and\r\nif men, instead of dwelling upon the evidences which God has given to\r\nsustain their faith, permit themselves to question and cavil, they will\r\nfind their doubts constantly becoming more confirmed.\r\n\r\nBut those who doubt God’s promises, and distrust the assurance of His\r\ngrace, are dishonoring Him; and their influence, instead of drawing others\r\nto Christ, tends to repel them from Him. They are unproductive trees, that\r\nspread their dark branches far and wide, shutting away the sunlight from\r\nother plants, and causing them to droop and die under the chilling shadow.\r\nThe life-work of these persons will appear as a never-ceasing witness\r\nagainst them. They are sowing seeds of doubt and skepticism that will\r\nyield an unfailing harvest.\r\n\r\nThere is but one course for those to pursue who honestly desire to be\r\nfreed from doubts. Instead of questioning and caviling concerning that\r\nwhich they do not understand, let them give heed to the light which\r\nalready shines upon them, and they will receive greater light. Let them do\r\nevery duty which has been made plain to their understanding, and they will\r\nbe enabled to understand and perform those of which they are now in doubt.\r\n\r\nSatan can present a counterfeit so closely resembling the truth that it\r\ndeceives those who are willing to be deceived, who desire to shun the\r\nself-denial and sacrifice demanded by the truth; but it is impossible for\r\nhim to hold under his power one soul who honestly desires, at whatever\r\ncost, to know the truth. Christ is the truth, and the “light, which\r\nlighteth every man that cometh into the world.”(924) The Spirit of truth\r\nhas been sent to guide men into all truth. And upon the authority of the\r\nSon of God it is declared, “Seek, and ye shall find.” “If any man will do\r\nHis will, he shall know of the doctrine.”(925)\r\n\r\nThe followers of Christ know little of the plots which Satan and his hosts\r\nare forming against them. But He who sitteth in the heavens will overrule\r\nall these devices for the accomplishment of His deep designs. The Lord\r\npermits His people to be subjected to the fiery ordeal of temptation, not\r\nbecause He takes pleasure in their distress and affliction, but because\r\nthis process is essential to their final victory. He could not,\r\nconsistently with His own glory, shield them from temptation; for the very\r\nobject of the trial is to prepare them to resist all the allurements of\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nNeither wicked men nor devils can hinder the work of God, or shut out His\r\npresence from His people, if they will, with subdued, contrite hearts,\r\nconfess and put away their sins, and in faith claim His promises. Every\r\ntemptation, every opposing influence, whether open or secret, may be\r\nsuccessfully resisted, “not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit,\r\nsaith the Lord of hosts.”(926)\r\n\r\n“The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and His ears are open unto\r\ntheir prayers.... And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of\r\nthat which is good?”(927) When Balaam, allured by the promise of rich\r\nrewards, practised enchantments against Israel, and by sacrifices to the\r\nLord sought to invoke a curse upon His people, the Spirit of God forbade\r\nthe evil which he longed to pronounce, and Balaam was forced to exclaim:\r\n“How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom\r\nthe Lord hath not defied?” “Let me die the death of the righteous, and let\r\nmy last end be like his!” When sacrifice had again been offered, the\r\nungodly prophet declared: “Behold, I have received commandment to bless:\r\nand He hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it. He hath not beheld iniquity\r\nin Jacob, neither hath He seen perverseness in Israel: the Lord his God is\r\nwith him, and the shout of a King is among them.” “Surely there is no\r\nenchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel:\r\naccording to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath\r\nGod wrought!”(928) Yet a third time altars were erected, and again Balaam\r\nessayed to secure a curse. But from the unwilling lips of the prophet, the\r\nSpirit of God declared the prosperity of His chosen, and rebuked the folly\r\nand malice of their foes: “Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is\r\nhe that curseth thee.”(929)\r\n\r\nThe people of Israel were at this time loyal to God; and so long as they\r\ncontinued in obedience to His law, no power in earth or hell could prevail\r\nagainst them. But the curse which Balaam had not been permitted to\r\npronounce against God’s people, he finally succeeded in bringing upon them\r\nby seducing them into sin. When they transgressed God’s commandments, then\r\nthey separated themselves from Him, and they were left to feel the power\r\nof the destroyer.\r\n\r\nSatan is well aware that the weakest soul who abides in Christ is more\r\nthan a match for the hosts of darkness, and that, should he reveal himself\r\nopenly, he would be met and resisted. Therefore he seeks to draw away the\r\nsoldiers of the cross from their strong fortification, while he lies in\r\nambush with his forces, ready to destroy all who venture upon his ground.\r\nOnly in humble reliance upon God, and obedience to all His commandments,\r\ncan we be secure.\r\n\r\nNo man is safe for a day or an hour without prayer. Especially should we\r\nentreat the Lord for wisdom to understand His word. Here are revealed the\r\nwiles of the tempter, and the means by which he may be successfully\r\nresisted. Satan is an expert in quoting Scripture, placing his own\r\ninterpretation upon passages, by which he hopes to cause us to stumble. We\r\nshould study the Bible with humility of heart, never losing sight of our\r\ndependence upon God. While we must constantly guard against the devices of\r\nSatan, we should pray in faith continually, “Lead us not into temptation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n33. THE FIRST GREAT DECEPTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nWith the earliest history of man, Satan began his efforts to deceive our\r\nrace. He who had incited rebellion in heaven, desired to bring the\r\ninhabitants of the earth to unite with him in his warfare against the\r\ngovernment of God. Adam and Eve had been perfectly happy in obedience to\r\nthe law of God, and this fact was a constant testimony against the claim\r\nwhich Satan had urged in heaven, that God’s law was oppressive, and\r\nopposed to the good of His creatures. And furthermore, Satan’s envy was\r\nexcited as he looked upon the beautiful home prepared for the sinless\r\npair. He determined to cause their fall, that, having separated them from\r\nGod and brought them under his own power, he might gain possession of the\r\nearth, and here establish his kingdom, in opposition to the Most High.\r\n\r\nHad Satan revealed himself in his real character, he would have been\r\nrepulsed at once, for Adam and Eve had been warned against this dangerous\r\nfoe; but he worked in the dark, concealing his purpose, that he might more\r\neffectually accomplish his object. Employing as his medium the serpent,\r\nthen a creature of fascinating appearance, he addressed himself to Eve,\r\n“Hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?”(930) Had\r\nEve refrained from entering into argument with the tempter, she would have\r\nbeen safe; but she ventured to parley with him, and fell a victim to his\r\nwiles. It is thus that many are still overcome. They doubt and argue\r\nconcerning the requirements of God; and instead of obeying the divine\r\ncommands, they accept human theories, which but disguise the devices of\r\nSatan.\r\n\r\n“The woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of\r\nthe garden: but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the\r\ngarden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it,\r\nlest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:\r\nfor God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be\r\nopened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.”(931) He declared\r\nthat they would become like God, possessing greater wisdom than before,\r\nand being capable of a higher state of existence. Eve yielded to\r\ntemptation; and through her influence, Adam was led into sin. They\r\naccepted the words of the serpent, that God did not mean what He said;\r\nthey distrusted their Creator, and imagined that He was restricting their\r\nliberty, and that they might obtain great wisdom and exaltation by\r\ntransgressing His law.\r\n\r\nBut what did Adam, after his sin, find to be the meaning of the words, “In\r\nthe day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die”? Did he find them\r\nto mean, as Satan had led him to believe, that he was to be ushered into a\r\nmore exalted state of existence? Then indeed there was great good to be\r\ngained by transgression, and Satan was proved to be a benefactor of the\r\nrace. But Adam did not find this to be the meaning of the divine sentence.\r\nGod declared that as a penalty for his sin, man should return to the\r\nground whence he was taken: “Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou\r\nreturn.”(932) The words of Satan, “Your eyes shall be opened,” proved to\r\nbe true in this sense only: After Adam and Eve had disobeyed God, their\r\neyes were opened to discern their folly; they did know evil, and they\r\ntasted the bitter fruit of transgression.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of Eden grew the tree of life, whose fruit had the power of\r\nperpetuating life. Had Adam remained obedient to God, he would have\r\ncontinued to enjoy free access to this tree, and would have lived forever.\r\nBut when he sinned, he was cut off from partaking of the tree of life, and\r\nhe became subject to death. The divine sentence, “Dust thou art, and unto\r\ndust shalt thou return,” points to the utter extinction of life.\r\n\r\nImmortality, promised to man on condition of obedience, had been forfeited\r\nby transgression. Adam could not transmit to his posterity that which he\r\ndid not possess; and there could have been no hope for the fallen race had\r\nnot God, by the sacrifice of His Son, brought immortality within their\r\nreach. While “death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned,” Christ\r\n“hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.”(933) And\r\nonly through Christ can immortality be obtained. Said Jesus, “He that\r\nbelieveth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the\r\nSon shall not see life.”(934) Every man may come into possession of this\r\npriceless blessing if he will comply with the conditions. All “who by\r\npatient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and\r\nimmortality,” will receive “eternal life.”(935)\r\n\r\nThe only one who promised Adam life in disobedience was the great\r\ndeceiver. And the declaration of the serpent to Eve in Eden,—“Ye shall not\r\nsurely die,”—was the first sermon ever preached upon the immortality of\r\nthe soul. Yet this declaration, resting solely upon the authority of\r\nSatan, is echoed from the pulpits of Christendom, and is received by the\r\nmajority of mankind as readily as it was received by our first parents.\r\nThe divine sentence, “The soul that sinneth, it shall die,”(936) is made\r\nto mean, The soul that sinneth, it shall not die, but live eternally. We\r\ncannot but wonder at the strange infatuation which renders men so\r\ncredulous concerning the words of Satan, and so unbelieving in regard to\r\nthe words of God.\r\n\r\nHad man, after his fall, been allowed free access to the tree of life, he\r\nwould have lived forever, and thus sin would have been immortalized. But\r\ncherubim and a flaming sword kept “the way of the tree of life,”(937) and\r\nnot one of the family of Adam has been permitted to pass that barrier and\r\npartake of the life-giving fruit. Therefore there is not an immortal\r\nsinner.\r\n\r\nBut after the fall, Satan bade his angels make a special effort to\r\ninculcate the belief in man’s natural immortality; and having induced the\r\npeople to receive this error, they were to lead them on to conclude that\r\nthe sinner would live in eternal misery. Now the prince of darkness,\r\nworking through his agents, represents God as a revengeful tyrant,\r\ndeclaring that He plunges into hell all those who do not please Him, and\r\ncauses them ever to feel His wrath; and that while they suffer unutterable\r\nanguish, and writhe in the eternal flames, their Creator looks down upon\r\nthem with satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThus the arch-fiend clothes with his own attributes the Creator and\r\nBenefactor of mankind. Cruelty is satanic. God is love; and all that He\r\ncreated was pure, holy, and lovely, until sin was brought in by the first\r\ngreat rebel. Satan himself is the enemy who tempts man to sin, and then\r\ndestroys him if he can; and when he has made sure of his victim, then he\r\nexults in the ruin he has wrought. If permitted, he would sweep the entire\r\nrace into his net. Were it not for the interposition of divine power, not\r\none son or daughter of Adam would escape.\r\n\r\nSatan is seeking to overcome men to-day, as he overcame our first parents,\r\nby shaking their confidence in their Creator, and leading them to doubt\r\nthe wisdom of His government and the justice of His laws. Satan and his\r\nemissaries represent God as even worse than themselves, in order to\r\njustify their own malignity and rebellion. The great deceiver endeavors to\r\nshift his own horrible cruelty of character upon our heavenly Father, that\r\nhe may cause himself to appear as one greatly wronged by his expulsion\r\nfrom heaven because he would not submit to so unjust a governor. He\r\npresents before the world the liberty which they may enjoy under his mild\r\nsway, in contrast with the bondage imposed by the stern decrees of\r\nJehovah. Thus he succeeds in luring souls away from their allegiance to\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nHow repugnant to every emotion of love and mercy, and even to our sense of\r\njustice, is the doctrine that the wicked dead are tormented with fire and\r\nbrimstone in an eternally burning hell; that for the sins of a brief\r\nearthly life they are to suffer torture as long as God shall live. Yet\r\nthis doctrine has been widely taught, and is still embodied in many of the\r\ncreeds of Christendom. Said a learned doctor of divinity: “The sight of\r\nhell-torments will exalt the happiness of the saints forever. When they\r\nsee others who are of the same nature and born under the same\r\ncircumstances, plunged in such misery, and they so distinguished, it will\r\nmake them sensible of how happy they are.” Another used these words:\r\n“While the decree of reprobation is eternally executing on the vessels of\r\nwrath, the smoke of their torment will be eternally ascending in view of\r\nthe vessels of mercy, who, instead of taking the part of these miserable\r\nobjects, will say, Amen, Alleluia! praise ye the Lord!”\r\n\r\nWhere, in the pages of God’s word, is such teaching to be found? Will the\r\nredeemed in heaven be lost to all emotions of pity and compassion, and\r\neven to feelings of common humanity? Are these to be exchanged for the\r\nindifference of the stoic, or the cruelty of the savage? No, no; such is\r\nnot the teaching of the Book of God. Those who present the views expressed\r\nin the quotations given above may be learned and even honest men; but they\r\nare deluded by the sophistry of Satan. He leads them to misconstrue strong\r\nexpressions of Scripture, giving to the language the coloring of\r\nbitterness and malignity which pertains to himself, but not to our\r\nCreator. “As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death\r\nof the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye,\r\nturn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die?”(938)\r\n\r\nWhat would be gained to God should we admit that He delights in witnessing\r\nunceasing tortures; that He is regaled with the groans and shrieks and\r\nimprecations of the suffering creatures whom He holds in the flames of\r\nhell? Can these horrid sounds be music in the ear of Infinite Love? It is\r\nurged that the infliction of endless misery upon the wicked would show\r\nGod’s hatred of sin as an evil which is ruinous to the peace and order of\r\nthe universe. Oh, dreadful blasphemy! As if God’s hatred of sin is the\r\nreason why it is perpetuated. For, according to the teachings of these\r\ntheologians, continued torture without hope of mercy maddens its wretched\r\nvictims, and as they pour out their rage in curses and blasphemy, they are\r\nforever augmenting their load of guilt. God’s glory is not enhanced by\r\nthus perpetuating continually increasing sin through ceaseless ages.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond the power of the human mind to estimate the evil which has\r\nbeen wrought by the heresy of eternal torment. The religion of the Bible,\r\nfull of love and goodness, and abounding in compassion, is darkened by\r\nsuperstition and clothed with terror. When we consider in what false\r\ncolors Satan has painted the character of God, can we wonder that our\r\nmerciful Creator is feared, dreaded, and even hated? The appalling views\r\nof God which have spread over the world from the teachings of the pulpit\r\nhave made thousands, yes, millions, of skeptics and infidels.\r\n\r\nThe theory of eternal torment is one of the false doctrines that\r\nconstitute the wine of the abominations of Babylon, of which she makes all\r\nnations drink.(939) That ministers of Christ should have accepted this\r\nheresy and proclaimed it from the sacred desk, is indeed a mystery. They\r\nreceived it from Rome, as they received the false sabbath. True, it has\r\nbeen taught by great and good men; but the light on this subject had not\r\ncome to them as it has come to us. They were responsible only for the\r\nlight which shone in their time; we are accountable for that which shines\r\nin our day. If we turn from the testimony of God’s word, and accept false\r\ndoctrines because our fathers taught them, we fall under the condemnation\r\npronounced upon Babylon; we are drinking of the wine of her abominations.\r\n\r\nA large class to whom the doctrine of eternal torment is revolting, are\r\ndriven to the opposite error. They see that the Scriptures represent God\r\nas a being of love and compassion, and they cannot believe that He will\r\nconsign His creatures to the fires of an eternally burning hell. But\r\nholding that the soul is naturally immortal, they see no alternative but\r\nto conclude that all mankind will finally be saved. Many regard the\r\nthreatenings of the Bible as designed merely to frighten men into\r\nobedience, and not to be literally fulfilled. Thus the sinner can live in\r\nselfish pleasure, disregarding the requirements of God, and yet expect to\r\nbe finally received into His favor. Such a doctrine, presuming upon God’s\r\nmercy, but ignoring His justice, pleases the carnal heart, and emboldens\r\nthe wicked in their iniquity.\r\n\r\nTo show how believers in universal salvation wrest the Scriptures to\r\nsustain their soul-destroying dogmas, it is needful only to cite their own\r\nutterances. At the funeral of an irreligious young man, who had been\r\nkilled instantly by an accident, a Universalist minister selected as his\r\ntext the Scripture statement concerning David, “He was comforted\r\nconcerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.”(940)\r\n\r\n“I am frequently asked,” said the speaker, “what will be the fate of those\r\nwho leave the world in sin, die, perhaps, in a state of inebriation, die\r\nwith the scarlet stains of crime unwashed from their robes, or die as this\r\nyoung man died, having never made a profession or enjoyed an experience of\r\nreligion. We are content with the Scriptures; their answer shall solve the\r\nawful problem. Amnon was exceedingly sinful; he was unrepentant, he was\r\nmade drunk, and while drunk was killed. David was a prophet of God; he\r\nmust have known whether it would be ill or well for Amnon in the world to\r\ncome. What were the expressions of his heart? ‘The soul of King David\r\nlonged to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon,\r\nseeing he was dead.’\r\n\r\n“And what is the inference to be deduced from this language? Is it not\r\nthat endless suffering formed no part of his religious belief? So we\r\nconceive; and here we discover a triumphant argument in support of the\r\nmore pleasing, more enlightened, more benevolent hypothesis of ultimate\r\nuniversal purity and peace. He was comforted, seeing his son was dead. And\r\nwhy so? Because by the eye of prophecy he could look forward into the\r\nglorious future, and see that son far removed from all temptations,\r\nreleased from the bondage and purified from the corruptions of sin, and\r\nafter being made sufficiently holy and enlightened, admitted to the\r\nassembly of ascended and rejoicing spirits. His only comfort was, that in\r\nbeing removed from the present state of sin and suffering, his beloved son\r\nhad gone where the loftiest breathings of the Holy Spirit would be shed\r\nupon his darkened soul; where his mind would be unfolded to the wisdom of\r\nheaven and the sweet raptures of immortal love, and thus prepared with a\r\nsanctified nature to enjoy the rest and society of the heavenly\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\n“In these thoughts we would be understood to believe that the salvation of\r\nheaven depends upon nothing which we can do in this life; neither upon a\r\npresent change of heart, nor upon present belief, or a present profession\r\nof religion.”\r\n\r\nThus does the professed minister of Christ reiterate the falsehood uttered\r\nby the serpent in Eden, “Ye shall not surely die.” “In the day ye eat\r\nthereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods.” He\r\ndeclares that the vilest of sinners,—the murderer, the thief, and the\r\nadulterer,—will after death be prepared to enter into immortal bliss.\r\n\r\nAnd from what does this perverter of the Scriptures draw his conclusions?\r\nFrom a single sentence expressing David’s submission to the dispensation\r\nof Providence. His soul “longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was\r\ncomforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.” The poignancy of his\r\ngrief having been softened by time, his thoughts turned from the dead to\r\nthe living son, self-banished through fear of the just punishment of his\r\ncrime. And this is the evidence that the incestuous, drunken Amnon was at\r\ndeath immediately transported to the abodes of bliss, there to be purified\r\nand prepared for the companionship of sinless angels! A pleasing fable\r\nindeed, well suited to gratify the carnal heart! This is Satan’s own\r\ndoctrine, and it does his work effectually. Should we be surprised that,\r\nwith such instruction, wickedness abounds?\r\n\r\nThe course pursued by this one false teacher illustrates that of many\r\nothers. A few words of Scripture are separated from the context, which\r\nwould, in many cases, show their meaning to be exactly opposite to the\r\ninterpretation put upon them; and such disjointed passages are perverted\r\nand used in proof of doctrines that have no foundation in the word of God.\r\nThe testimony cited as evidence that the drunken Amnon is in heaven, is a\r\nmere inference, directly contradicted by the plain and positive statement\r\nof the Scriptures, that no drunkard shall inherit the kingdom of God.(941)\r\nIt is thus that doubters, unbelievers, and skeptics turn the truth into a\r\nlie. And multitudes have been deceived by their sophistry, and rocked to\r\nsleep in the cradle of carnal security.\r\n\r\nIf it were true that the souls of all men passed directly to heaven at the\r\nhour of dissolution, then we might well covet death rather than life. Many\r\nhave been led by this belief to put an end to their existence. When\r\noverwhelmed with trouble, perplexity, and disappointment, it seems an easy\r\nthing to break the brittle thread of life, and soar away into the bliss of\r\nthe eternal world.\r\n\r\nGod has given in His word decisive evidence that He will punish the\r\ntransgressors of His law. Those who flatter themselves that He is too\r\nmerciful to execute justice upon the sinner, have only to look to the\r\ncross of Calvary. The death of the spotless Son of God testifies that “the\r\nwages of sin is death,” that every violation of God’s law must receive its\r\njust retribution. Christ the sinless became sin for man. He bore the guilt\r\nof transgression, and the hiding of His Father’s face, until His heart was\r\nbroken and His life crushed out. All this sacrifice was made that sinners\r\nmight be redeemed. In no other way could man be freed from the penalty of\r\nsin. And every soul that refuses to become a partaker of the atonement\r\nprovided at such a cost, must bear in his own person the guilt and\r\npunishment of transgression.\r\n\r\nLet us consider what the Bible teaches further concerning the ungodly and\r\nunrepentant, whom the Universalist places in heaven as holy, happy angels.\r\n\r\n“I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life\r\nfreely.”(942) This promise is only to those that thirst. None but those\r\nwho feel their need of the water of life, and seek it at the loss of all\r\nthings else, will be supplied. “He that overcometh shall inherit all\r\nthings; and I will be his God, and he shall be My son.”(943) Here, also,\r\nconditions are specified. In order to inherit all things, we must resist\r\nand overcome sin.\r\n\r\nThe Lord declares by the prophet Isaiah, “Say ye to the righteous, that it\r\nshall be well with him.” “Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him:\r\nfor the reward of his hands shall be given him.”(944) “Though a sinner do\r\nevil a hundred times,” says the wise man, “and his days be prolonged, yet\r\nsurely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear\r\nbefore Him: but it shall not be well with the wicked.”(945) And Paul\r\ntestifies that the sinner is treasuring up unto himself “wrath against the\r\nday of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will\r\nrender to every man according to his deeds;” “tribulation and anguish upon\r\nevery soul of man that doeth evil.”(946)\r\n\r\n“No fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater,\r\nhath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.”(947) “Follow peace\r\nwith all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.”(948)\r\n“Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to\r\nthe tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. For\r\nwithout are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and\r\nidolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.”(949)\r\n\r\nGod has given to men a declaration of His character, and of His method of\r\ndealing with sin. “The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering,\r\nand abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving\r\niniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the\r\nguilty.”(950) “All the wicked will He destroy.” “The transgressors shall\r\nbe destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.”(951) The\r\npower and authority of the divine government will be employed to put down\r\nrebellion; yet all the manifestations of retributive justice will be\r\nperfectly consistent with the character of God as a merciful,\r\nlong-suffering, benevolent being.\r\n\r\nGod does not force the will or judgment of any. He takes no pleasure in a\r\nslavish obedience. He desires that the creatures of His hands shall love\r\nHim because He is worthy of love. He would have them obey Him because they\r\nhave an intelligent appreciation of His wisdom, justice, and benevolence.\r\nAnd all who have a just conception of these qualities will love Him\r\nbecause they are drawn toward Him in admiration of His attributes.\r\n\r\nThe principles of kindness, mercy, and love, taught and exemplified by our\r\nSaviour, are a transcript of the will and character of God. Christ\r\ndeclared that He taught nothing except that which He had received from His\r\nFather. The principles of the divine government are in perfect harmony\r\nwith the Saviour’s precept, “Love your enemies.” God executes justice upon\r\nthe wicked, for the good of the universe, and even for the good of those\r\nupon whom His judgments are visited. He would make them happy if He could\r\ndo so in accordance with the laws of His government and the justice of His\r\ncharacter. He surrounds them with the tokens of His love, He grants them a\r\nknowledge of His law, and follows them with the offers of His mercy; but\r\nthey despise His love, make void His law, and reject His mercy. While\r\nconstantly receiving His gifts, they dishonor the Giver; they hate God\r\nbecause they know that He abhors their sins. The Lord bears long with\r\ntheir perversity; but the decisive hour will come at last, when their\r\ndestiny is to be decided. Will He then chain these rebels to His side?\r\nWill He force them to do His will?\r\n\r\nThose who have chosen Satan as their leader, and have been controlled by\r\nhis power, are not prepared to enter the presence of God. Pride,\r\ndeception, licentiousness, cruelty, have become fixed in their characters.\r\nCan they enter heaven, to dwell forever with those whom they despised and\r\nhated on earth? Truth will never be agreeable to a liar; meekness will not\r\nsatisfy self-esteem and pride; purity is not acceptable to the corrupt;\r\ndisinterested love does not appear attractive to the selfish. What source\r\nof enjoyment could heaven offer to those who are wholly absorbed in\r\nearthly and selfish interests?\r\n\r\nCould those whose lives have been spent in rebellion against God be\r\nsuddenly transported to heaven, and witness the high, the holy state of\r\nperfection that ever exists there,—every soul filled with love, every\r\ncountenance beaming with joy, enrapturing music in melodious strains\r\nrising in honor of God and the Lamb, and ceaseless streams of light\r\nflowing upon the redeemed from the face of Him who sitteth upon the\r\nthrone,—could those whose hearts are filled with hatred of God, of truth\r\nand holiness, mingle with the heavenly throng and join their songs of\r\npraise? Could they endure the glory of God and the Lamb? No, no; years of\r\nprobation were granted them, that they might form characters for heaven;\r\nbut they have never trained the mind to love purity; they have never\r\nlearned the language of heaven, and now it is too late. A life of\r\nrebellion against God has unfitted them for heaven. Its purity, holiness,\r\nand peace would be torture to them; the glory of God would be a consuming\r\nfire. They would long to flee from that holy place. They would welcome\r\ndestruction, that they might be hidden from the face of Him who died to\r\nredeem them. The destiny of the wicked is fixed by their own choice. Their\r\nexclusion from heaven is voluntary with themselves, and just and merciful\r\non the part of God.\r\n\r\nLike the waters of the flood, the fires of the great day declare God’s\r\nverdict that the wicked are incurable. They have no disposition to submit\r\nto divine authority. Their will has been exercised in revolt; and when\r\nlife is ended, it is too late to turn the current of their thoughts in the\r\nopposite direction, too late to turn from transgression to obedience, from\r\nhatred to love.\r\n\r\nIn sparing the life of Cain the murderer, God gave the world an example of\r\nwhat would be the result of permitting the sinner to live, to continue a\r\ncourse of unbridled iniquity. Through the influence of Cain’s teaching and\r\nexample, multitudes of his descendants were led into sin, until “the\r\nwickedness of man was great in the earth,” and “every imagination of the\r\nthoughts of his heart was only evil continually.” “The earth also was\r\ncorrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.”(952)\r\n\r\nIn mercy to the world, God blotted out its wicked inhabitants in Noah’s\r\ntime. In mercy, He destroyed the corrupt dwellers in Sodom. Through the\r\ndeceptive power of Satan, the workers of iniquity obtain sympathy and\r\nadmiration, and are thus constantly leading others to rebellion. It was so\r\nin Cain’s and in Noah’s day, and in the time of Abraham and Lot; it is so\r\nin our time. It is in mercy to the universe that God will finally destroy\r\nthe rejecters of His grace.\r\n\r\n“The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through\r\nJesus Christ our Lord.”(953) While life is the inheritance of the\r\nrighteous, death is the portion of the wicked. Moses declared to Israel,\r\n“I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil.”(954)\r\nThe death referred to in these scriptures is not that pronounced upon\r\nAdam, for all mankind suffer the penalty of his transgression. It is the\r\n“second death” that is placed in contrast with everlasting life.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of Adam’s sin, death passed upon the whole human race. All\r\nalike go down into the grave. And through the provisions of the plan of\r\nsalvation, all are to be brought forth from their graves. “There shall be\r\na resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust;”(955) “for as in\r\nAdam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.”(956) But a\r\ndistinction is made between the two classes that are brought forth. “All\r\nthat are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they\r\nthat have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have\r\ndone evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.”(957) They who have been\r\n“accounted worthy” of the resurrection of life, are “blessed and holy.”\r\n“On such the second death hath no power.”(958) But those who have not,\r\nthrough repentance and faith, secured pardon, must receive the penalty of\r\ntransgression,—“the wages of sin.” They suffer punishment varying in\r\nduration and intensity, “according to their works,” but finally ending in\r\nthe second death. Since it is impossible for God, consistently with His\r\njustice and mercy, to save the sinner in his sins, He deprives him of the\r\nexistence which his transgressions have forfeited, and of which he has\r\nproved himself unworthy. Says an inspired writer, “Yet a little while, and\r\nthe wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place,\r\nand it shall not be.” And another declares, “They shall be as though they\r\nhad not been.”(959) Covered with infamy, they sink into hopeless, eternal\r\noblivion.\r\n\r\nThus will be made an end of sin, with all the woe and ruin which have\r\nresulted from it. Says the psalmist: “Thou hast destroyed the wicked, Thou\r\nhast put out their name forever and ever. O thou enemy, destructions are\r\ncome to a perpetual end.”(960) John, in the Revelation, looking forward to\r\nthe eternal state, hears a universal anthem of praise, undisturbed by one\r\nnote of discord. Every creature in heaven and earth was heard ascribing\r\nglory to God.(961) There will then be no lost souls to blaspheme God, as\r\nthey writhe in never-ending torment; no wretched beings in hell will\r\nmingle their shrieks with the songs of the saved.\r\n\r\nUpon the fundamental error of natural immortality rests the doctrine of\r\nconsciousness in death,—a doctrine, like eternal torment, opposed to the\r\nteachings of the Scriptures, to the dictates of reason, and to our\r\nfeelings of humanity. According to the popular belief, the redeemed in\r\nheaven are acquainted with all that takes place on the earth, and\r\nespecially with the lives of the friends whom they have left behind. But\r\nhow could it be a source of happiness to the dead to know the troubles of\r\nthe living, to witness the sins committed by their own loved ones, and to\r\nsee them enduring all the sorrows, disappointments, and anguish of life?\r\nHow much of heaven’s bliss would be enjoyed by those who were hovering\r\nover their friends on earth? And how utterly revolting is the belief that\r\nas soon as the breath leaves the body, the soul of the impenitent is\r\nconsigned to the flames of hell! To what depths of anguish must those be\r\nplunged who see their friends passing to the grave unprepared, to enter\r\nupon an eternity of woe and sin! Many have been driven to insanity by this\r\nharrowing thought.\r\n\r\nWhat say the Scriptures concerning these things? David declares that man\r\nis not conscious in death. “His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his\r\nearth; in that very day his thoughts perish.”(962) Solomon bears the same\r\ntestimony: “The living know that they shall die: but the dead know not\r\nanything.” “Their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished;\r\nneither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done\r\nunder the sun.” “There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom,\r\nin the grave, whither thou goest.”(963)\r\n\r\nWhen, in answer to his prayer, Hezekiah’s life was prolonged fifteen\r\nyears, the grateful king rendered to God a tribute of praise for His great\r\nmercy. In this song he tells the reason why he thus rejoices: “The grave\r\ncannot praise Thee, death cannot celebrate Thee: they that go down into\r\nthe pit cannot hope for Thy truth. The living, the living, he shall praise\r\nThee, as I do this day.”(964) Popular theology represents the righteous\r\ndead as in heaven, entered into bliss, and praising God with an immortal\r\ntongue; but Hezekiah could see no such glorious prospect in death. With\r\nhis words agrees the testimony of the psalmist: “In death there is no\r\nremembrance of Thee: in the grave who shall give Thee thanks?” “The dead\r\npraise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence.”(965)\r\n\r\nPeter, on the day of Pentecost, declared that the patriarch David “is both\r\ndead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us unto this day.” “For David\r\nis not ascended into the heavens.”(966) The fact that David remains in the\r\ngrave until the resurrection, proves that the righteous do not go to\r\nheaven at death. It is only through the resurrection, and by virtue of the\r\nfact that Christ has risen, that David can at last sit at the right hand\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nAnd said Paul: “If the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if\r\nChrist be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then\r\nthey also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.”(967) If for\r\nfour thousand years the righteous had gone directly to heaven at death,\r\nhow could Paul have said that if there is no resurrection, “they which are\r\nfallen asleep in Christ are perished”? No resurrection would be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe martyr Tyndale, referring to the state of the dead, declared: “I\r\nconfess openly, that I am not persuaded that they be already in the full\r\nglory that Christ is in, or the elect angels of God are in. Neither is it\r\nany article of my faith; for if it were so, I see not but then the\r\npreaching of the resurrection of the flesh were a thing in vain.”(968)\r\n\r\nIt is an undeniable fact that the hope of immortal blessedness at death\r\nhas led to wide-spread neglect of the Bible doctrine of the resurrection.\r\nThis tendency was remarked by Dr. Adam Clarke, who said: “The doctrine of\r\nthe resurrection appears to have been thought of much more consequence\r\namong the primitive Christians than it is _now!_ How is this? The apostles\r\nwere continually insisting on it, and exciting the followers of God to\r\ndiligence, obedience, and cheerfulness through it. And their successors in\r\nthe present day seldom mention it! So apostles preached, and so primitive\r\nChristians believed; so we preach, and so our hearers believe. There is\r\nnot a doctrine in the gospel on which more stress is laid; and there is\r\nnot a doctrine in the present system of preaching which is treated with\r\nmore neglect!”(969)\r\n\r\nThis has continued until the glorious truth of the resurrection has been\r\nalmost wholly obscured, and lost sight of by the Christian world. Thus a\r\nleading religious writer, commenting on the words of Paul in 1 Thess.\r\n4:13-18, says: “For all practical purposes of comfort the doctrine of the\r\nblessed immortality of the righteous takes the place for us of any\r\ndoubtful doctrine of the Lord’s second coming. At our death the Lord comes\r\nfor us. That is what we are to wait and watch for. The dead are already\r\npassed into glory. They do not wait for the trump for their judgment and\r\nblessedness.”\r\n\r\nBut when about to leave His disciples, Jesus did not tell them that they\r\nwould soon come to Him. “I go to prepare a place for you,” He said. “And\r\nif I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you\r\nunto Myself.”(970) And Paul tells us, further, that “the Lord Himself\r\nshall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel,\r\nand with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then\r\nwe which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the\r\nclouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the\r\nLord.” And he adds, “Comfort one another with these words.”(971) How wide\r\nthe contrast between these words of comfort and those of the Universalist\r\nminister previously quoted. The latter consoled the bereaved friends with\r\nthe assurance, that, however sinful the dead might have been, when he\r\nbreathed out his life here he was to be received among the angels. Paul\r\npoints his brethren to the future coming of the Lord, when the fetters of\r\nthe tomb shall be broken, and the “dead in Christ” shall be raised to\r\neternal life.\r\n\r\nBefore any can enter the mansions of the blest, their cases must be\r\ninvestigated, and their characters and their deeds must pass in review\r\nbefore God. All are to be judged according to the things written in the\r\nbooks, and to be rewarded as their works have been. This judgment does not\r\ntake place at death. Mark the words of Paul: “He hath appointed a day, in\r\nthe which He will judge the world in righteousness by that Man whom He\r\nhath ordained; whereof He hath given assurance unto all men, in that He\r\nhath raised Him from the dead.”(972) Here the apostle plainly stated that\r\na specified time, then future, had been fixed upon for the judgment of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nJude refers to the same period: “The angels which kept not their first\r\nestate, but left their own habitation, He hath reserved in everlasting\r\nchains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.” And again he\r\nquotes the words of Enoch: “Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of\r\nHis saints, to execute judgment upon all.”(973) John declares that he “saw\r\nthe dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened;\r\n... and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the\r\nbooks.”(974)\r\n\r\nBut if the dead are already enjoying the bliss of heaven or writhing in\r\nthe flames of hell, what need of a future judgment? The teachings of God’s\r\nword on these important points are neither obscure nor contradictory; they\r\nmay be understood by common minds. But what candid mind can see either\r\nwisdom or justice in the current theory? Will the righteous, after the\r\ninvestigation of their cases at the judgment, receive the commendation,\r\n“Well done, thou good and faithful servant, ... _enter thou_ into the joy\r\nof thy Lord,”(975) when they have been dwelling in His presence, perhaps\r\nfor long ages? Are the wicked summoned from the place of torment to\r\nreceive the sentence from the Judge of all the earth, “Depart from Me, ye\r\ncursed, into everlasting fire”?(976) Oh, solemn mockery! shameful\r\nimpeachment of the wisdom and justice of God!\r\n\r\nThe theory of the immortality of the soul was one of those false doctrines\r\nthat Rome, borrowing from paganism, incorporated into the religion of\r\nChristendom. Martin Luther classed it with the “monstrous fables that form\r\npart of the Roman dunghill of decretals.”(977) Commenting on the words of\r\nSolomon in Ecclesiastes, that the dead know not anything, the Reformer\r\nsays: “Another place proving that the dead have no ... feeling. There is,\r\nsaith he, no duty, no science, no knowledge, no wisdom there. Solomon\r\njudgeth that the dead are asleep, and feel nothing at all. For the dead\r\nlie there, accounting neither days nor years, but when they are awaked,\r\nthey shall seem to have slept scarce one minute.”(978)\r\n\r\nNowhere in the Sacred Scriptures is found the statement that the righteous\r\ngo to their reward or the wicked to their punishment at death. The\r\npatriarchs and prophets have left no such assurance. Christ and His\r\napostles have given no hint of it. The Bible clearly teaches that the dead\r\ndo not go immediately to heaven. They are represented as sleeping until\r\nthe resurrection.(979) In the very day when the silver cord is loosed and\r\nthe golden bowl broken,(980) man’s thoughts perish. They that go down to\r\nthe grave are in silence. They know no more of anything that is done under\r\nthe sun.(981) Blessed rest for the weary righteous! Time, be it long or\r\nshort, is but a moment to them. They sleep; they are awakened by the trump\r\nof God to a glorious immortality. “For the trumpet shall sound, and the\r\ndead shall be raised incorruptible.... So when this corruptible shall have\r\nput on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then\r\nshall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up\r\nin victory.”(982) As they are called forth from their deep slumber, they\r\nbegin to think just where they ceased. The last sensation was the pang of\r\ndeath, the last thought that they were falling beneath the power of the\r\ngrave. When they arise from the tomb, their first glad thought will be\r\nechoed in the triumphal shout, “O death, where is thy sting? O grave,\r\nwhere is thy victory?”(983)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n34. SPIRITUALISM.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nThe ministration of holy angels, as presented in the Scriptures, is a\r\ntruth most comforting and precious to every follower of Christ. But the\r\nBible teaching upon this point has been obscured and perverted by the\r\nerrors of popular theology. The doctrine of natural immortality, first\r\nborrowed from the pagan philosophy, and in the darkness of the great\r\napostasy incorporated into the Christian faith, has supplanted the truth,\r\nso plainly taught in Scripture, that “the dead know not anything.”\r\nMultitudes have come to believe that it is the spirits of the dead who are\r\nthe “ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be\r\nheirs of salvation.” And this notwithstanding the testimony of Scripture\r\nto the existence of heavenly angels, and their connection with the history\r\nof man, before the death of a human being.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of man’s consciousness in death, especially the belief that\r\nthe spirits of the dead return to minister to the living, has prepared the\r\nway for modern Spiritualism. If the dead are admitted to the presence of\r\nGod and holy angels, and privileged with knowledge far exceeding what they\r\nbefore possessed, why should they not return to the earth to enlighten and\r\ninstruct the living? If, as taught by popular theologians, the spirits of\r\nthe dead are hovering about their friends on earth, why should they not be\r\npermitted to communicate with them, to warn them against evil, or to\r\ncomfort them in sorrow? How can those who believe in man’s consciousness\r\nin death reject what comes to them as divine light communicated by\r\nglorified spirits? Here is a channel regarded as sacred, through which\r\nSatan works for the accomplishment of his purposes. The fallen angels who\r\ndo his bidding appear as messengers from the spirit world. While\r\nprofessing to bring the living into communication with the dead, the\r\nprince of evil exercises his bewitching influence upon their minds.\r\n\r\nHe has power to bring before men the appearance of their departed friends.\r\nThe counterfeit is perfect; the familiar look, the words, the tone, are\r\nreproduced with marvelous distinctness. Many are comforted with the\r\nassurance that their loved ones are enjoying the bliss of heaven; and\r\nwithout suspicion of danger, they give ear to “seducing spirits, and\r\ndoctrines of devils.”\r\n\r\nWhen they have been led to believe that the dead actually return to\r\ncommunicate with them, Satan causes those to appear who went into the\r\ngrave unprepared. They claim to be happy in heaven, and even to occupy\r\nexalted positions there; and thus the error is widely taught, that no\r\ndifference is made between the righteous and the wicked. The pretended\r\nvisitants from the world of spirits sometimes utter cautions and warnings\r\nwhich prove to be correct. Then, as confidence is gained, they present\r\ndoctrines that directly undermine faith in the Scriptures. With an\r\nappearance of deep interest in the well-being of their friends on earth,\r\nthey insinuate the most dangerous errors. The fact that they state some\r\ntruths, and are able at times to foretell future events, gives to their\r\nstatements an appearance of reliability; and their false teachings are\r\naccepted by the multitudes as readily, and believed as implicitly, as if\r\nthey were the most sacred truths of the Bible. The law of God is set\r\naside, the Spirit of grace despised, the blood of the covenant counted an\r\nunholy thing. The spirits deny the deity of Christ, and place even the\r\nCreator on a level with themselves. Thus under a new disguise the great\r\nrebel still carries on his warfare against God, begun in heaven, and for\r\nnearly six thousand years continued upon the earth.\r\n\r\nMany endeavor to account for spiritual manifestations by attributing them\r\nwholly to fraud and sleight of hand on the part of the medium. But while\r\nit is true that the results of trickery have often been palmed off as\r\ngenuine manifestations, there have been, also, marked exhibitions of\r\nsupernatural power. The mysterious rapping with which modern Spiritualism\r\nbegan was not the result of human trickery or cunning, but was the direct\r\nwork of evil angels, who thus introduced one of the most successful of\r\nsoul-destroying delusions. Many will be ensnared through the belief that\r\nSpiritualism is a merely human imposture; when brought face to face with\r\nmanifestations which they cannot but regard as supernatural, they will be\r\ndeceived, and will be led to accept them as the great power of God.\r\n\r\nThese persons overlook the testimony of the Scriptures concerning the\r\nwonders wrought by Satan and his agents. It was by satanic aid that\r\nPharaoh’s magicians were enabled to counterfeit the work of God. Paul\r\ntestifies that before the second advent of Christ there will be similar\r\nmanifestations of satanic power. The coming of the Lord is to be preceded\r\nby “the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and\r\nwith all deceivableness of unrighteousness.”(984) And the apostle John,\r\ndescribing the miracle-working power that will be manifested in the last\r\ndays, declares: “He doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down\r\nfrom heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that\r\ndwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to\r\ndo.”(985) No mere impostures are here foretold. Men are deceived by the\r\nmiracles which Satan’s agents have power to do, not which they pretend to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nThe prince of darkness, who has so long bent the powers of his master-mind\r\nto the work of deception, skilfully adapts his temptations to men of all\r\nclasses and conditions. To persons of culture and refinement he presents\r\nSpiritualism in its more refined and intellectual aspects, and thus\r\nsucceeds in drawing many into his snare. The wisdom which Spiritualism\r\nimparts is that described by the apostle James, which “descendeth not from\r\nabove, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.”(986) This, however, the great\r\ndeceiver conceals, when concealment will best suit his purpose. He who\r\ncould appear clothed with the brightness of the heavenly seraphs before\r\nChrist in the wilderness of temptation, comes to men in the most\r\nattractive manner, as an angel of light. He appeals to the reason by the\r\npresentation of elevating themes; he delights the fancy with enrapturing\r\nscenes; and he enlists the affections by his eloquent portrayals of love\r\nand charity. He excites the imagination to lofty flights, leading men to\r\ntake so great pride in their own wisdom that in their hearts they despise\r\nthe Eternal One. That mighty being who could take the world’s Redeemer to\r\nan exceedingly high mountain, and bring before Him all the kingdoms of the\r\nearth and the glory of them, will present his temptations to men in a\r\nmanner to pervert the senses of all who are not shielded by divine power.\r\n\r\nSatan beguiles men now as he beguiled Eve in Eden, by flattery, by\r\nkindling a desire to obtain forbidden knowledge, by exciting ambition for\r\nself-exaltation. It was cherishing these evils that caused his fall, and\r\nthrough them he aims to compass the ruin of men. “Ye shall be as gods,” he\r\ndeclares, “knowing good and evil.”(987) Spiritualism teaches “that man is\r\nthe creature of progression; that it is his destiny from his birth to\r\nprogress, even to eternity, toward the Godhead.” And again: “Each mind\r\nwill judge itself and not another.” “The judgment will be right, because\r\nit is the judgment of self.... The throne is within you.” Said a\r\nSpiritualistic teacher, as the “spiritual consciousness” awoke within him,\r\n“My fellow-men, all were unfallen demigods.” And another declares, “Any\r\njust and perfect being is Christ.”\r\n\r\nThus, in place of the righteousness and perfection of the infinite God,\r\nthe true object of adoration; in place of the perfect righteousness of His\r\nlaw, the true standard of human attainment, Satan has substituted the\r\nsinful, erring nature of man himself, as the only object of adoration, the\r\nonly rule of judgment, or standard of character. This is progress, not\r\nupward, but downward.\r\n\r\nIt is a law both of the intellectual and the spiritual nature, that by\r\nbeholding, we become changed. The mind gradually adapts itself to the\r\nsubjects upon which it is allowed to dwell. It becomes assimilated to that\r\nwhich it is accustomed to love and reverence. Man will never rise higher\r\nthan his standard of purity or goodness or truth. If self is his loftiest\r\nideal, he will never attain to anything more exalted. Rather, he will\r\nconstantly sink lower and lower. The grace of God alone has power to exalt\r\nman. Left to himself, his course must inevitably be downward.\r\n\r\nTo the self-indulgent, the pleasure-loving, the sensual, Spiritualism\r\npresents itself under a less subtle disguise than to the more refined and\r\nintellectual; in its grosser forms they find that which is in harmony with\r\ntheir inclinations. Satan studies every indication of the frailty of human\r\nnature, he marks the sins which each individual is inclined to commit, and\r\nthen he takes care that opportunities shall not be wanting to gratify the\r\ntendency to evil. He tempts men to excess in that which is in itself\r\nlawful, causing them, through intemperance, to weaken physical, mental,\r\nand moral power. He has destroyed and is destroying thousands through the\r\nindulgence of the passions, thus brutalizing the entire nature of man. And\r\nto complete his work, he declares, through the spirits, that “true\r\nknowledge places man above all law;” that “whatever is, is right;” that\r\n“God doth not condemn;” and that “_all_ sins which are committed are\r\ninnocent.” When the people are thus led to believe that desire is the\r\nhighest law, that liberty is license, and that man is accountable only to\r\nhimself, who can wonder that corruption and depravity teem on every hand?\r\nMultitudes eagerly accept teachings that leave them at liberty to obey the\r\npromptings of the carnal heart. The reins of self-control are laid upon\r\nthe neck of lust, the powers of mind and soul are made subject to the\r\nanimal propensities, and Satan exultingly sweeps into his net thousands\r\nwho profess to be followers of Christ.\r\n\r\nBut none need be deceived by the lying claims of Spiritualism. God has\r\ngiven the world sufficient light to enable them to discover the snare. As\r\nalready shown, the theory which forms the very foundation of Spiritualism\r\nis at war with the plainest statements of Scripture. The Bible declares\r\nthat the dead know not anything, that their thoughts have perished; they\r\nhave no part in anything that is done under the sun; they know nothing of\r\nthe joys or sorrows of those who were dearest to them on earth.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, God has expressly forbidden all pretended communication with\r\ndeparted spirits. In the days of the Hebrews there was a class of people\r\nwho claimed, as do the Spiritualists of to-day, to hold communication with\r\nthe dead. But the “familiar spirits,” as these visitants from other worlds\r\nwere called, are declared by the Bible to be the “spirits of devils.”(988)\r\nThe work of dealing with familiar spirits was pronounced an abomination to\r\nthe Lord, and was solemnly forbidden under penalty of death.(989) The very\r\nname of witchcraft is now held in contempt. The claim that men can hold\r\nintercourse with evil spirits is regarded as a fable of the Dark Ages. But\r\nSpiritualism, which numbers its converts by hundreds of thousands, yea, by\r\nmillions, which has made its way into scientific circles, which has\r\ninvaded churches, and has found favor in legislative bodies, and even in\r\nthe courts of kings,—this mammoth deception is but a revival, in a new\r\ndisguise, of the witchcraft condemned and prohibited of old.\r\n\r\nIf there were no other evidence of the real character of Spiritualism, it\r\nshould be enough for the Christian that the spirits make no difference\r\nbetween righteousness and sin, between the noblest and purest of the\r\napostles of Christ and the most corrupt of the servants of Satan. By\r\nrepresenting the basest of men as in heaven, and highly exalted there,\r\nSatan says to the world: “No matter how wicked you are; no matter whether\r\nyou believe or disbelieve God and the Bible. Live as you please; heaven is\r\nyour home.” The Spiritualist teachers virtually declare, “Every one that\r\ndoeth evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and He delighteth in them;\r\nor, Where is the God of judgment?”(990) Saith the word of God, “Woe unto\r\nthem that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and\r\nlight for darkness.”(991)\r\n\r\nThe apostles, as personated by these lying spirits, are made to contradict\r\nwhat they wrote at the dictation of the Holy Spirit when on earth. They\r\ndeny the divine origin of the Bible, and thus tear away the foundation of\r\nthe Christian’s hope, and put out the light that reveals the way to\r\nheaven. Satan is making the world believe that the Bible is a mere\r\nfiction, or at least a book suited to the infancy of the race, but now to\r\nbe lightly regarded, or cast aside as obsolete. And to take the place of\r\nthe word of God he holds out spiritual manifestations. Here is a channel\r\nwholly under his control; by this means he can make the world believe what\r\nhe will. The Book that is to judge him and his followers he puts in the\r\nshade, just where he wants it; the Saviour of the world he makes to be no\r\nmore than a common man. And as the Roman guard that watched the tomb of\r\nJesus spread the lying report which the priests and elders put into their\r\nmouths to disprove His resurrection, so do the believers in spiritual\r\nmanifestations try to make it appear that there is nothing miraculous in\r\nthe circumstances of our Saviour’s life. After thus seeking to put Jesus\r\nin the background, they call attention to their own miracles, declaring\r\nthat these far exceed the works of Christ.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Spiritualism is now changing its form, and, veiling some\r\nof its more objectionable features, is assuming a Christian guise. But its\r\nutterances from the platform and the press have been before the public for\r\nmany years, and in these its real character stands revealed. These\r\nteachings cannot be denied or hidden.\r\n\r\nEven in its present form, so far from being more worthy of toleration than\r\nformerly, it is really a more dangerous, because a more subtle deception.\r\nWhile it formerly denounced Christ and the Bible, it now _professes_ to\r\naccept both. But the Bible is interpreted in a manner that is pleasing to\r\nthe unrenewed heart, while its solemn and vital truths are made of no\r\neffect. Love is dwelt upon as the chief attribute of God, but it is\r\ndegraded to a weak sentimentalism, making little distinction between good\r\nand evil. God’s justice, His denunciations of sin, the requirements of His\r\nholy law, are all kept out of sight. The people are taught to regard the\r\ndecalogue as a dead letter. Pleasing, bewitching fables captivate the\r\nsenses, and lead men to reject the Bible as the foundation of their faith.\r\nChrist is as verily denied as before; but Satan has so blinded the eyes of\r\nthe people that the deception is not discerned.\r\n\r\nThere are few who have any just conception of the deceptive power of\r\nSpiritualism and the danger of coming under its influence. Many tamper\r\nwith it, merely to gratify their curiosity. They have no real faith in it,\r\nand would be filled with horror at the thought of yielding themselves to\r\nthe spirits’ control. But they venture upon the forbidden ground, and the\r\nmighty destroyer exercises his power upon them against their will. Let\r\nthem once be induced to submit their minds to his direction, and he holds\r\nthem captive. It is impossible, in their own strength, to break away from\r\nthe bewitching, alluring spell. Nothing but the power of God, granted in\r\nanswer to the earnest prayer of faith, can deliver these ensnared souls.\r\n\r\nAll who indulge sinful traits of character, or wilfully cherish a known\r\nsin, are inviting the temptations of Satan. They separate themselves from\r\nGod and from the watchcare of His angels; as the evil one presents his\r\ndeceptions, they are without defense, and fall an easy prey. Those who\r\nthus place themselves in his power, little realize where their course will\r\nend. Having achieved their overthrow, the tempter will employ them as his\r\nagents to lure others to ruin.\r\n\r\nSays the prophet Isaiah: “When they shall say unto you, Seek unto them\r\nthat have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter:\r\nshould not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? To\r\nthe law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it\r\nis because there is no light in them.”(992) If men had been willing to\r\nreceive the truth so plainly stated in the Scriptures, concerning the\r\nnature of man and the state of the dead, they would see in the claims and\r\nmanifestations of Spiritualism the working of Satan with power and signs\r\nand lying wonders. But rather than yield the liberty so agreeable to the\r\ncarnal heart, and renounce the sins which they love, multitudes close\r\ntheir eyes to the light, and walk straight on, regardless of warnings,\r\nwhile Satan weaves his snares about them, and they become his prey.\r\n“Because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be\r\nsaved,” therefore “God shall send them strong delusion, that they should\r\nbelieve a lie.”(993)\r\n\r\nThose who oppose the teachings of Spiritualism are assailing, not men\r\nalone, but Satan and his angels. They have entered upon a contest against\r\nprincipalities and powers and wicked spirits in high places. Satan will\r\nnot yield one inch of ground except as he is driven back by the power of\r\nheavenly messengers. The people of God should be able to meet him, as did\r\nour Saviour, with the words, “It is written.” Satan can quote Scripture\r\nnow as in the days of Christ, and he will pervert its teachings to sustain\r\nhis delusions. Those who would stand in this time of peril must understand\r\nfor themselves the testimony of the Scriptures. Many will be confronted by\r\nthe spirits of devils personating beloved relatives or friends, and\r\ndeclaring the most dangerous heresies. These visitants will appeal to our\r\ntenderest sympathies, and will work miracles to sustain their pretensions.\r\nWe must be prepared to withstand them with the Bible truth that the dead\r\nknow not anything, and that they who thus appear are the spirits of\r\ndevils.\r\n\r\nJust before us is the “hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the\r\nworld, to try them that dwell upon the earth.”(994) All whose faith is not\r\nfirmly established upon the word of God will be deceived and overcome.\r\nSatan “works with all deceivableness of unrighteousness” to gain control\r\nof the children of men; and his deceptions will continually increase. But\r\nhe can gain his object only as men voluntarily yield to his temptations.\r\nThose who are earnestly seeking a knowledge of the truth, and are striving\r\nto purify their souls through obedience, thus doing what they can to\r\nprepare for the conflict, will find, in the God of truth, a sure defense.\r\n“Because thou hast kept the word of My patience, I also will keep\r\nthee,”(995) is the Saviour’s promise. He would sooner send every angel out\r\nof heaven to protect His people, than leave one soul that trusts in Him to\r\nbe overcome by Satan.\r\n\r\nThe prophet Isaiah brings to view the fearful deception which will come\r\nupon the wicked, causing them to count themselves secure from the\r\njudgments of God: “We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are\r\nwe at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall\r\nnot come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood\r\nhave we hid ourselves.”(996) In the class here described are included\r\nthose who in their stubborn impenitence comfort themselves with the\r\nassurance that there is to be no punishment for the sinner; that all\r\nmankind, it matters not how corrupt, are to be exalted to heaven, to\r\nbecome as the angels of God. But still more emphatically are those making\r\na covenant with death and an agreement with hell, who renounce the truths\r\nwhich Heaven has provided as a defense for the righteous in the day of\r\ntrouble, and accept the refuge of lies offered by Satan in its stead,—the\r\ndelusive pretensions of Spiritualism.\r\n\r\nMarvelous beyond expression is the blindness of the people of this\r\ngeneration. Thousands reject the word of God as unworthy of belief, and\r\nwith eager confidence receive the deceptions of Satan. Skeptics and\r\nscoffers denounce the bigotry of those who contend for the faith of\r\nprophets and apostles, and they divert themselves by holding up to\r\nridicule the solemn declarations of the Scriptures concerning Christ and\r\nthe plan of salvation, and the retribution to be visited upon the\r\nrejecters of the truth. They affect great pity for minds so narrow, weak,\r\nand superstitious as to acknowledge the claims of God and obey the\r\nrequirements of His law. They manifest as much assurance as if, indeed,\r\nthey had made a covenant with death and an agreement with hell,—as if they\r\nhad erected an impassable, impenetrable barrier between themselves and the\r\nvengeance of God. Nothing can arouse their fears. So fully have they\r\nyielded to the tempter, so closely are they united with him, and so\r\nthoroughly imbued with his spirit, that they have no power and no\r\ninclination to break away from his snare.\r\n\r\nSatan has long been preparing for his final effort to deceive the world.\r\nThe foundation of his work was laid by the assurance given to Eve in Eden,\r\n“Ye shall not surely die.” “In the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes\r\nshall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.”(997)\r\nLittle by little he has prepared the way for his masterpiece of deception\r\nin the development of Spiritualism. He has not yet reached the full\r\naccomplishment of his designs; but it will be reached in the last remnant\r\nof time. Says the prophet: “I saw three unclean spirits like frogs; ...\r\nthey are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the\r\nkings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of\r\nthat great day of God Almighty.”(998) Except those who are kept by the\r\npower of God, through faith in His word, the whole world will be swept\r\ninto the ranks of this delusion. The people are fast being lulled to a\r\nfatal security, to be awakened only by the outpouring of the wrath of God.\r\n\r\nSaith the Lord God: “Judgment also will I lay to the line, and\r\nrighteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of\r\nlies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place. And your covenant\r\nwith death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not\r\nstand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be\r\ntrodden down by it.”(999)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n35. AIMS OF THE PAPACY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nRomanism is now regarded by Protestants with far greater favor than in\r\nformer years. In those countries where Catholicism is not in the\r\nascendency, and the papists are taking a conciliatory course in order to\r\ngain influence, there is an increasing indifference concerning the\r\ndoctrines that separate the reformed churches from the papal hierarchy;\r\nthe opinion is gaining ground, that, after all, we do not differ so widely\r\nupon vital points as has been supposed, and that a little concession on\r\nour part will bring us into a better understanding with Rome. The time was\r\nwhen Protestants placed a high value upon the liberty of conscience which\r\nhad been so dearly purchased. They taught their children to abhor popery,\r\nand held that to seek harmony with Rome would be disloyalty to God. But\r\nhow widely different are the sentiments now expressed.\r\n\r\nThe defenders of the papacy declare that the church has been maligned; and\r\nthe Protestant world are inclined to accept the statement. Many urge that\r\nit is unjust to judge the church of to-day by the abominations and\r\nabsurdities that marked her reign during the centuries of ignorance and\r\ndarkness. They excuse her horrible cruelty as the result of the barbarism\r\nof the times, and plead that the influence of modern civilization has\r\nchanged her sentiments.\r\n\r\nHave these persons forgotten the claim of infallibility put forth for\r\neight hundred years by this haughty power? So far from being relinquished,\r\nthis claim was affirmed in the nineteenth century with greater\r\npositiveness than ever before. As Rome asserts that the church “_never\r\nerred_; nor will it, according to the Scriptures, _ever err_,”(1000) how\r\ncan she renounce the principles which governed her course in past ages?\r\n\r\nThe papal church will never relinquish her claim to infallibility. All\r\nthat she has done in her persecution of those who reject her dogmas, she\r\nholds to be right; and would she not repeat the same acts, should the\r\nopportunity be presented? Let the restraints now imposed by secular\r\ngovernments be removed, and Rome be re-instated in her former power, and\r\nthere would speedily be a revival of her tyranny and persecution.\r\n\r\nA well-known writer speaks thus of the attitude of the papal hierarchy as\r\nregards freedom of conscience, and of the perils which especially threaten\r\nthe United States from the success of her policy:\r\n\r\n“There are many who are disposed to attribute any fear of Roman\r\nCatholicism in the United States to bigotry or childishness. Such see\r\nnothing in the character and attitude of Romanism that is hostile to our\r\nfree institutions, or find nothing portentous in its growth. Let us, then,\r\nfirst compare some of the fundamental principles of our government with\r\nthose of the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\n“The Constitution of the United States guarantees _liberty of conscience_.\r\nNothing is dearer or more fundamental. Pope Pius IX., in his Encyclical\r\nLetter of August 15, 1854, said: ‘The absurd and erroneous doctrines or\r\nravings in defense of liberty of conscience, are a most pestilential\r\nerror—a pest, of all others, most to be dreaded in a State.’ The same\r\npope, in his Encyclical Letter of December 8, 1864, anathematized ‘those\r\nwho assert the liberty of conscience science and of religious worship,’\r\nalso ‘all such as maintain that the church may not employ force.’\r\n\r\n“The pacific tone of Rome in the United States does not imply a change of\r\nheart. She is tolerant where she is helpless. Says Bishop O’Connor:\r\n‘Religious liberty is merely endured until the opposite can be carried\r\ninto effect without peril to the Catholic world.’... The archbishop of St.\r\nLouis once said: ‘Heresy and unbelief are crimes; and in Christian\r\ncountries, as in Italy and Spain, for instance, where all the people are\r\nCatholics, and where the Catholic religion is an essential part of the law\r\nof the land, they are punished as other crimes.’...\r\n\r\n“Every cardinal, archbishop, and bishop in the Catholic Church takes an\r\noath of allegiance to the pope, in which occur the following words:\r\n‘Heretics, schismatics, and rebels to our said lord (the pope), or his\r\naforesaid successors, I will to my utmost persecute and oppose.’ ”(1001)\r\n\r\nIt is true that there are real Christians in the Roman Catholic communion.\r\nThousands in that church are serving God according to the best light they\r\nhave. They are not allowed access to His word, and therefore they do not\r\ndiscern the truth. They have never seen the contrast between a living\r\nheart-service and a round of mere forms and ceremonies. God looks with\r\npitying tenderness upon these souls, educated as they are in a faith that\r\nis delusive and unsatisfying. He will cause rays of light to penetrate the\r\ndense darkness that surrounds them. He will reveal to them the truth as it\r\nis in Jesus, and many will yet take their position with His people.\r\n\r\nBut Romanism as a system is no more in harmony with the gospel of Christ\r\nnow than at any former period in her history. The Protestant churches are\r\nin great darkness, or they would discern the signs of the times. The Roman\r\nChurch is far-reaching in her plans and modes of operation. She is\r\nemploying every device to extend her influence and increase her power in\r\npreparation for a fierce and determined conflict to regain control of the\r\nworld, to re-establish persecution, and to undo all that Protestantism has\r\ndone. Catholicism is gaining ground upon every side. See the increasing\r\nnumber of her churches and chapels in Protestant countries. Look at the\r\npopularity of her colleges and seminaries in America, so widely patronized\r\nby Protestants. Look at the growth of ritualism in England, and the\r\nfrequent defections to the ranks of the Catholics. These things should\r\nawaken the anxiety of all who prize the pure principles of the gospel.\r\n\r\nProtestants have tampered with and patronized popery; they have made\r\ncompromises and concessions which papists themselves are surprised to see,\r\nand fail to understand. Men are closing their eyes to the real character\r\nof Romanism, and the dangers to be apprehended from her supremacy. The\r\npeople need to be aroused to resist the advances of this most dangerous\r\nfoe to civil and religious liberty.\r\n\r\nMany Protestants suppose that the Catholic religion is unattractive, and\r\nthat its worship is a dull, meaningless round of ceremony. Here they\r\nmistake. While Romanism is based upon deception, it is not a coarse and\r\nclumsy imposture. The religious service of the Roman Church is a most\r\nimpressive ceremonial. Its gorgeous display and solemn rites fascinate the\r\nsenses of the people, and silence the voice of reason and of conscience.\r\nThe eye is charmed. Magnificent churches, imposing processions, golden\r\naltars, jeweled shrines, choice paintings, and exquisite sculpture appeal\r\nto the love of beauty. The ear also is captivated. The music is\r\nunsurpassed. The rich notes of the deep-toned organ, blending with the\r\nmelody of many voices as it swells through the lofty domes and pillared\r\naisles of her grand cathedrals, cannot fail to impress the mind with awe\r\nand reverence.\r\n\r\n                         [Interior of a church.]\r\n\r\nThis outward splendor, pomp, and ceremony, that only mocks the longings of\r\nthe sin-sick soul, is an evidence of inward corruption. The religion of\r\nChrist needs not such attractions to recommend it. In the light shining\r\nfrom the cross, true Christianity appears so pure and lovely that no\r\nexternal decorations can enhance its true worth. It is the beauty of\r\nholiness, a meek and quiet spirit, which is of value with God.\r\n\r\nBrilliancy of style is not necessarily an index of pure, elevated thought.\r\nHigh conceptions of art, delicate refinement of taste, often exist in\r\nminds that are earthly and sensual. They are often employed by Satan to\r\nlead men to forget the necessities of the soul, to lose sight of the\r\nfuture, immortal life, to turn away from their infinite Helper, and to\r\nlive for this world alone.\r\n\r\nA religion of externals is attractive to the unrenewed heart. The pomp and\r\nceremony of the Catholic worship has a seductive, bewitching power, by\r\nwhich many are deceived; and they come to look upon the Roman Church as\r\nthe very gate of heaven. None but those who have planted their feet firmly\r\nupon the foundation of truth, and whose hearts are renewed by the Spirit\r\nof God, are proof against her influence. Thousands who have not an\r\nexperimental knowledge of Christ will be led to accept the forms of\r\ngodliness without the power. Such a religion is just what the multitudes\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nThe church’s claim to the right to pardon, leads the Romanist to feel at\r\nliberty to sin; and the ordinance of confession, without which her pardon\r\nis not granted, tends also to give license to evil. He who kneels before\r\nfallen man, and opens in confession the secret thoughts and imaginations\r\nof his heart, is debasing his manhood, and degrading every noble instinct\r\nof his soul. In unfolding the sins of his life to a priest,—an erring,\r\nsinful mortal, and too often corrupted with wine and licentiousness,—his\r\nstandard of character is lowered, and he is defiled in consequence. His\r\nthought of God is degraded to the likeness of fallen humanity; for the\r\npriest stands as a representative of God. This degrading confession of man\r\nto man is the secret spring from which has flowed much of the evil that is\r\ndefiling the world, and fitting it for the final destruction. Yet to him\r\nwho loves self-indulgence, it is more pleasing to confess to a\r\nfellow-mortal than to open the soul to God. It is more palatable to human\r\nnature to do penance than to renounce sin; it is easier to mortify the\r\nflesh by sackcloth and nettles and galling chains than to crucify fleshly\r\nlusts. Heavy is the yoke which the carnal heart is willing to bear rather\r\nthan bow to the yoke of Christ.\r\n\r\nThere is a striking similarity between the Church of Rome and the Jewish\r\nChurch at the time of Christ’s first advent. While the Jews secretly\r\ntrampled upon every principle of the law of God, they were outwardly\r\nrigorous in the observance of its precepts, loading it down with exactions\r\nand traditions that made obedience painful and burdensome. As the Jews\r\nprofessed to revere the law, so do Romanists claim to reverence the cross.\r\nThey exalt the symbol of Christ’s sufferings, while in their lives they\r\ndeny Him whom it represents.\r\n\r\nPapists place crosses upon their churches, upon their altars, and upon\r\ntheir garments. Everywhere is seen the insignia of the cross. Everywhere\r\nit is outwardly honored and exalted. But the teachings of Christ are\r\nburied beneath a mass of senseless traditions, false interpretations, and\r\nrigorous exactions. The Saviour’s words concerning the bigoted Jews, apply\r\nwith still greater force to the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church:\r\n“They bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s\r\nshoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their\r\nfingers.”(1002) Conscientious souls are kept in constant terror, fearing\r\nthe wrath of an offended God, while many of the dignitaries of the church\r\nare living in luxury and sensual pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe worship of images and relics, the invocation of saints, and the\r\nexaltation of the pope, are devices of Satan to attract the minds of the\r\npeople from God and from His Son. To accomplish their ruin, he endeavors\r\nto turn their attention from Him through whom alone they can find\r\nsalvation. He will direct them to any object that can be substituted for\r\nthe One who has said, “Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy\r\nladen, and I will give you rest.”(1003)\r\n\r\nIt is Satan’s constant effort to misrepresent the character of God, the\r\nnature of sin, and the real issues at stake in the great controversy. His\r\nsophistry lessens the obligation of the divine law, and gives men license\r\nto sin. At the same time he causes them to cherish false conceptions of\r\nGod, so that they regard Him with fear and hate, rather than with love.\r\nThe cruelty inherent in his own character is attributed to the Creator; it\r\nis embodied in systems of religion, and expressed in modes of worship.\r\nThus the minds of men are blinded, and Satan secures them as his agents to\r\nwar against God. By perverted conceptions of the divine attributes,\r\nheathen nations were led to believe human sacrifices necessary to secure\r\nthe favor of Deity; and horrible cruelties have been perpetrated under the\r\nvarious forms of idolatry.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic Church, uniting the forms of paganism and Christianity,\r\nand, like paganism, misrepresenting the character of God, has resorted to\r\npractices no less cruel and revolting. In the days of Rome’s supremacy,\r\nthere were instruments of torture to compel assent to her doctrines. There\r\nwas the stake for those who would not concede to her claims. There were\r\nmassacres on a scale that will never be known until revealed in the\r\njudgment. Dignitaries of the church studied, under Satan their master, to\r\ninvent means to cause the greatest possible torture, and not end the life\r\nof their victim. In many cases the infernal process was repeated to the\r\nutmost limit of human endurance, until nature gave up the struggle, and\r\nthe sufferer hailed death as a sweet release.\r\n\r\nSuch was the fate of Rome’s opponents. For her adherents she had the\r\ndiscipline of the scourge, of famishing hunger, of bodily austerities in\r\nevery conceivable, heart-sickening form. To secure the favor of Heaven,\r\npenitents violated the laws of God by violating the laws of nature. They\r\nwere taught to sunder the ties which He has formed to bless and gladden\r\nman’s earthly sojourn. The churchyard contains millions of victims, who\r\nspent their lives in vain endeavors to subdue their natural affections, to\r\nrepress, as offensive to God, every thought and feeling of sympathy with\r\ntheir fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nIf we desire to understand the determined cruelty of Satan, manifested for\r\nhundreds of years, not among those who never heard of God, but in the very\r\nheart and throughout the extent of Christendom, we have only to look at\r\nthe history of Romanism. Through this mammoth system of deception the\r\nprince of evil achieves his purpose of bringing dishonor to God and\r\nwretchedness to man. And as we see how he succeeds in disguising himself,\r\nand accomplishing his work through the leaders of the church, we may\r\nbetter understand why he has so great antipathy to the Bible. If that book\r\nis read, the mercy and love of God will be revealed; it will be seen that\r\nHe lays upon men none of these heavy burdens. All that He asks is a broken\r\nand contrite heart, a humble, obedient spirit.\r\n\r\nChrist gives no example in His life for men and women to shut themselves\r\nin monasteries in order to become fitted for heaven. He has never taught\r\nthat love and sympathy must be repressed. The Saviour’s heart overflowed\r\nwith love. The nearer man approaches to moral perfection, the keener are\r\nhis sensibilities, the more acute is his perception of sin, and the deeper\r\nhis sympathy for the afflicted. The pope claims to be the vicar of Christ;\r\nbut how does his character bear comparison with that of our Saviour? Was\r\nChrist ever known to consign men to the prison or the rack because they\r\ndid not pay Him homage as the King of heaven? Was His voice heard\r\ncondemning to death those who did not accept Him? When He was slighted by\r\nthe people of a Samaritan village, the apostle John was filled with\r\nindignation, and inquired, “Lord, wilt Thou that we command fire to come\r\ndown from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?” Jesus looked with\r\npity upon His disciple, and rebuked his harsh spirit, saying, “The Son of\r\nman is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.”(1004) How\r\ndifferent from the spirit manifested by Christ is that of His professed\r\nvicar.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Church now presents a fair front to the world, covering with\r\napologies her record of horrible cruelties. She has clothed herself in\r\nChristlike garments; but she is unchanged. Every principle of the papacy\r\nthat existed in past ages exists to-day. The doctrines devised in the\r\ndarkest ages are still held. Let none deceive themselves. The papacy that\r\nProtestants are now so ready to honor is the same that ruled the world in\r\nthe days of the Reformation, when men of God stood up, at the peril of\r\ntheir lives, to expose her iniquity. She possesses the same pride and\r\narrogant assumption that lorded it over kings and princes, and claimed the\r\nprerogatives of God. Her spirit is no less cruel and despotic now than\r\nwhen she crushed out human liberty, and slew the saints of the Most High.\r\n\r\nThe papacy is just what prophecy declared that she would be, the apostasy\r\nof the latter times.(1005) It is a part of her policy to assume the\r\ncharacter which will best accomplish her purpose; but beneath the variable\r\nappearance of the chameleon, she conceals the invariable venom of the\r\nserpent. “Faith ought not to be kept with heretics, nor persons suspected\r\nof heresy,”(1006) she declares. Shall this power, whose record for a\r\nthousand years is written in the blood of the saints, be now acknowledged\r\nas a part of the church of Christ?\r\n\r\nIt is not without reason that the claim has been put forth in Protestant\r\ncountries, that Catholicism differs less widely from Protestantism than in\r\nformer times. There has been a change; but the change is not in the\r\npapacy. Catholicism indeed resembles much of the Protestantism that now\r\nexists; because Protestantism has so greatly degenerated since the days of\r\nthe Reformers.\r\n\r\nAs the Protestant churches have been seeking the favor of the world, false\r\ncharity has blinded their eyes. They do not see but that it is right to\r\nbelieve good of all evil; and as the inevitable result, they will finally\r\nbelieve evil of all good. Instead of standing in defense of the faith once\r\ndelivered to the saints, they are now, as it were, apologizing to Rome for\r\ntheir uncharitable opinion of her, begging pardon for their bigotry.\r\n\r\nA large class, even of those who look upon Romanism with no favor,\r\napprehend little danger from her power and influence. Many urge that the\r\nintellectual and moral darkness prevailing during the Middle Ages favored\r\nthe spread of her dogmas, superstitions, and oppression, and that the\r\ngreater intelligence of modern times, the general diffusion of knowledge,\r\nand the increasing liberality in matters of religion, forbid a revival of\r\nintolerance and tyranny. The very thought that such a state of things will\r\nexist in this enlightened age is ridiculed. It is true that great light,\r\nintellectual, moral, and religious, is shining upon this generation. In\r\nthe open pages of God’s holy word, light from heaven has been shed upon\r\nthe world. But it should be remembered that the greater the light\r\nbestowed, the greater the darkness of those who pervert or reject it.\r\n\r\nA prayerful study of the Bible would show Protestants the real character\r\nof the papacy, and would cause them to abhor and to shun it; but many are\r\nso wise in their own conceit that they feel no need of humbly seeking God\r\nthat they may be led into the truth. Although priding themselves on their\r\nenlightenment, they are ignorant both of the Scriptures and of the power\r\nof God. They must have some means of quieting their consciences; and they\r\nseek that which is least spiritual and humiliating. What they desire is a\r\nmethod of forgetting God which shall pass as a method of remembering Him.\r\nThe papacy is well adapted to meet the wants of all these. It is prepared\r\nfor two classes of mankind, embracing nearly the whole world,—those who\r\nwould be saved by their merits, and those who would be saved in their\r\nsins. Here is the secret of its power.\r\n\r\nA day of great intellectual darkness has been shown to be favorable to the\r\nsuccess of the papacy. It will yet be demonstrated that a day of great\r\nintellectual light is equally favorable for its success. In past ages,\r\nwhen men were without God’s word, and without the knowledge of the truth,\r\ntheir eyes were blindfolded, and thousands were ensnared, not seeing the\r\nnet spread for their feet. In this generation there are many whose eyes\r\nbecome dazzled by the glare of human speculations, “science falsely so\r\ncalled;” they discern not the net, and walk into it as readily as if\r\nblindfolded. God designed that man’s intellectual powers should be held as\r\na gift from his Maker, and should be employed in the service of truth and\r\nrighteousness; but when pride and ambition are cherished, and men exalt\r\ntheir own theories above the word of God, then intelligence can accomplish\r\ngreater harm than ignorance. Thus the false science of the present day,\r\nwhich undermines faith in the Bible, will prove as successful in preparing\r\nthe way for the acceptance of the papacy, with its pleasing forms, as did\r\nthe withholding of knowledge in opening the way for its aggrandizement in\r\nthe Dark Ages.\r\n\r\nIn the movements now in progress in the United States to secure for the\r\ninstitutions and usages of the church the support of the state,\r\nProtestants are following in the steps of papists. Nay, more, they are\r\nopening the door for the papacy to regain in Protestant America the\r\nsupremacy which she has lost in the Old World. And that which gives\r\ngreater significance to this movement is the fact that the principal\r\nobject contemplated is the enforcement of Sunday observance,—a custom\r\nwhich originated with Rome, and which she claims as the sign of her\r\nauthority. It is the spirit of the papacy,—the spirit of conformity to\r\nworldly customs, the veneration for human traditions above the\r\ncommandments of God,—that is permeating the Protestant churches, and\r\nleading them on to do the same work of Sunday exaltation which the papacy\r\nhas done before them.\r\n\r\nIf the reader would understand the agencies to be employed in the\r\nsoon-coming contest, he has but to trace the record of the means which\r\nRome employed for the same object in ages past. If he would know how\r\npapists and Protestants united will deal with those who reject their\r\ndogmas, let him see the spirit which Rome manifested toward the Sabbath\r\nand its defenders.\r\n\r\nRoyal edicts, general councils, and church ordinances sustained by secular\r\npower, were the steps by which the pagan festival attained its position of\r\nhonor in the Christian world. The first public measure enforcing Sunday\r\nobservance was the law enacted by Constantine.(1007) This edict required\r\ntownspeople to rest on “the venerable day of the sun,” but permitted\r\ncountrymen to continue their agricultural pursuits. Though virtually a\r\nheathen statute, it was enforced by the emperor after his nominal\r\nacceptance of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe royal mandate not proving a sufficient substitute for divine\r\nauthority, Eusebius, a bishop who sought the favor of princes, and who was\r\nthe special friend and flatterer of Constantine, advanced the claim that\r\nChrist had transferred the Sabbath to Sunday. Not a single testimony of\r\nthe Scriptures was produced in proof of the new doctrine. Eusebius himself\r\nunwittingly acknowledges its falsity, and points to the real authors of\r\nthe change. “All things,” he says, “whatever that it was duty to do on the\r\nSabbath, these _we_ have transferred to the Lord’s day.”(1008) But the\r\nSunday argument, groundless as it was, served to embolden men in trampling\r\nupon the Sabbath of the Lord. All who desired to be honored by the world\r\naccepted the popular festival.\r\n\r\nAs the papacy became firmly established, the work of Sunday exaltation was\r\ncontinued. For a time the people engaged in agricultural labor when not\r\nattending church, and the seventh day was still regarded as the Sabbath.\r\nBut steadily a change was effected. Those in holy office were forbidden to\r\npass judgment in any civil controversy on the Sunday. Soon after, all\r\npersons, of whatever rank, were commanded to refrain from common labor, on\r\npain of a fine for freemen, and stripes in the case of servants. Later it\r\nwas decreed that rich men should be punished with the loss of half of\r\ntheir estates; and finally, that if still obstinate they should be made\r\nslaves. The lower classes were to suffer perpetual banishment.\r\n\r\nMiracles also were called into requisition. Among other wonders it was\r\nreported that as a husbandman who was about to plow his field on Sunday,\r\ncleaned his plow with an iron, the iron stuck fast in his hand, and for\r\ntwo years he carried it about with him, “to his exceeding great pain and\r\nshame.”(1009)\r\n\r\nLater, the pope gave directions that the parish priest should admonish the\r\nviolators of Sunday, and wish them to go to church and say their prayers,\r\nlest they bring some great calamity on themselves and neighbors. An\r\necclesiastical council brought forward the argument, since so widely\r\nemployed, even by Protestants, that because persons had been struck by\r\nlightning while laboring on Sunday, it must be the Sabbath. “It is\r\napparent,” said the prelates, “how high the displeasure of God was upon\r\ntheir neglect of this day.” An appeal was then made that priests and\r\nministers, kings and princes, and all faithful people, “use their utmost\r\nendeavors and care that the day be restored to its honor, and, for the\r\ncredit of Christianity, more devoutly observed for the time to\r\ncome.”(1010)\r\n\r\nThe decrees of councils proving insufficient, the secular authorities were\r\nbesought to issue an edict that would strike terror to the hearts of the\r\npeople, and force them to refrain from labor on the Sunday. At a synod\r\nheld in Rome, all previous decisions were reaffirmed with greater force\r\nand solemnity. They were also incorporated into the ecclesiastical law,\r\nand enforced by the civil authorities throughout nearly all\r\nChristendom.(1011)\r\n\r\nStill the absence of scriptural authority for Sunday-keeping occasioned no\r\nlittle embarrassment. The people questioned the right of their teachers to\r\nset aside the positive declaration of Jehovah, “The seventh day is the\r\nSabbath of the Lord thy God,” in order to honor the day of the sun. To\r\nsupply the lack of Bible testimony, other expedients were necessary. A\r\nzealous advocate of Sunday, who about the close of the twelfth century\r\nvisited the churches of England, was resisted by faithful witnesses for\r\nthe truth; and so fruitless were his efforts that he departed from the\r\ncountry for a season, and cast about him for some means to enforce his\r\nteachings. When he returned, the lack was supplied, and in his\r\nafter-labors he met with greater success. He brought with him a roll\r\npurporting to be from God Himself, which contained the needed command for\r\nSunday observance, with awful threats to terrify the disobedient. This\r\nprecious document—as base a counterfeit as the institution it\r\nsupported—was said to have fallen from heaven, and to have been found in\r\nJerusalem, upon the altar of St. Simeon, in Golgotha. But in fact, the\r\npontifical palace at Rome was the source whence it proceeded. Frauds and\r\nforgeries to advance the power and prosperity of the church have in all\r\nages been esteemed lawful by the papal hierarchy.\r\n\r\nThe roll forbade labor from the ninth hour, three o’clock, on Saturday\r\nafternoon, till sunrise on Monday; and its authority was declared to be\r\nconfirmed by many miracles. It was reported that persons laboring beyond\r\nthe appointed hour were stricken with paralysis. A miller who attempted to\r\ngrind his corn, saw, instead of flour, a torrent of blood come forth, and\r\nthe mill-wheel stood still, notwithstanding the strong rush of the water.\r\nA woman who placed dough in the oven, found it raw when taken out, though\r\nthe oven was very hot. Another who had dough prepared for baking at the\r\nninth hour, but determined to set it aside till Monday, found, the next\r\nday, that it had been made into loaves and baked by divine power. A man\r\nwho baked bread after the ninth hour on Saturday, found, when he broke it\r\nthe next morning, that blood started therefrom. By such absurd and\r\nsuperstitious fabrications did the advocates of Sunday endeavor to\r\nestablish its sacredness.(1012)\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, as in England, a greater regard for Sunday was secured by\r\nuniting with it a portion of the ancient Sabbath. But the time required to\r\nbe kept holy varied. An edict from the king of Scotland declared that\r\n“Saturday from twelve at noon ought to be accounted holy,” and that no\r\nman, from that time till Monday morning, should engage in worldly\r\nbusiness.(1013)\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding all the efforts to establish Sunday sacredness,\r\npapists themselves publicly confessed the divine authority of the Sabbath,\r\nand the human origin of the institution by which it had been supplanted.\r\nIn the sixteenth century a papal council plainly declared: “Let all\r\nChristians remember that the seventh day was consecrated by God, and hath\r\nbeen received and observed, not only by the Jews, but by all others who\r\npretend to worship God; though we Christians have changed their Sabbath\r\ninto the Lord’s day.”(1014) Those who were tampering with the divine law\r\nwere not ignorant of the character of their work. They were deliberately\r\nsetting themselves above God.\r\n\r\nA striking illustration of Rome’s policy toward those who disagree with\r\nher was given in the long and bloody persecution of the Waldenses, some of\r\nwhom were observers of the Sabbath. Others suffered in a similar manner\r\nfor their fidelity to the fourth commandment. The history of the churches\r\nof Ethiopia and Abyssinia is especially significant. Amid the gloom of the\r\nDark Ages, the Christians of Central Africa were lost sight of and\r\nforgotten by the world, and for many centuries they enjoyed freedom in the\r\nexercise of their faith. But at last Rome learned of their existence, and\r\nthe emperor of Abyssinia was soon beguiled into an acknowledgment of the\r\npope as the vicar of Christ. Other concessions followed. An edict was\r\nissued forbidding the observance of the Sabbath under the severest\r\npenalties.(1015) But papal tyranny soon became a yoke so galling that the\r\nAbyssinians determined to break it from their necks. After a terrible\r\nstruggle, the Romanists were banished from their dominions, and the\r\nancient faith was restored. The churches rejoiced in their freedom, and\r\nthey never forgot the lesson they had learned concerning the deception,\r\nthe fanaticism, and the despotic power of Rome. Within their solitary\r\nrealm they were content to remain, unknown to the rest of Christendom.\r\n\r\nThe churches of Africa held the Sabbath as it was held by the papal church\r\nbefore her complete apostasy. While they kept the seventh day in obedience\r\nto the commandment of God, they abstained from labor on the Sunday in\r\nconformity to the custom of the church. Upon obtaining supreme power, Rome\r\nhad trampled upon the Sabbath of God to exalt her own; but the churches of\r\nAfrica, hidden for nearly a thousand years, did not share in this\r\napostasy. When brought under the sway of Rome, they were forced to set\r\naside the true and exalt the false sabbath; but no sooner had they\r\nregained their independence than they returned to obedience to the fourth\r\ncommandment.(1016)\r\n\r\nThese records of the past clearly reveal the enmity of Rome toward the\r\ntrue Sabbath and its defenders, and the means which she employs to honor\r\nthe institution of her creating. The word of God teaches that these scenes\r\nare to be repeated as Roman Catholics and Protestants shall unite for the\r\nexaltation of the Sunday.\r\n\r\nThe prophecy of Revelation 13 declares that the power represented by the\r\nbeast with lamb-like horns shall cause “the earth and them which dwell\r\ntherein” to worship the papacy—there symbolized by the beast “like unto a\r\nleopard.” The beast with two horns is also to say “to them that dwell on\r\nthe earth, that they should make an image to the beast;” and, furthermore,\r\nit is to command all, “both small and great, rich and poor, free and\r\nbond,” to receive “the mark of the beast.”(1017) It has been shown that\r\nthe United States is the power represented by the beast with lamb-like\r\nhorns, and that this prophecy will be fulfilled when the United States\r\nshall enforce Sunday observance, which Rome claims as the special\r\nacknowledgment of her supremacy. But in this homage to papacy the United\r\nStates will not be alone. The influence of Rome in the countries that once\r\nacknowledged her dominion, is still far from being destroyed. And prophecy\r\nforetells a restoration of her power. “I saw one of his heads as it were\r\nwounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world\r\nwondered after the beast.”(1018) The infliction of the deadly wound points\r\nto the downfall of the papacy in 1798. After this, says the prophet, “His\r\ndeadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.” Paul\r\nstates plainly that the man of sin will continue until the second\r\nadvent.(1019) To the very close of time he will carry forward his work of\r\ndeception. And the revelator declares, also referring to the papacy, “All\r\nthat dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written\r\nin the book of life.”(1020) In both the Old and the New World, the papacy\r\nwill receive homage in the honor paid to the Sunday institution, that\r\nrests solely upon the authority of the Roman Church.\r\n\r\nFor more than half a century, students of prophecy in the United States\r\nhave presented this testimony to the world. In the events now taking place\r\nis seen a rapid advance toward the fulfilment of the prediction. With\r\nProtestant teachers there is the same claim of divine authority for\r\nSunday-keeping, and the same lack of scriptural evidence, as with the\r\npapal leaders who fabricated miracles to supply the place of a command\r\nfrom God. The assertion that God’s judgments are visited upon men for\r\ntheir violation of the Sunday-sabbath, will be repeated; already it is\r\nbeginning to be urged. And a movement to enforce Sunday observance is fast\r\ngaining ground.\r\n\r\nMarvelous in her shrewdness and cunning is the Roman Church. She can read\r\nwhat is to be. She bides her time, seeing that the Protestant churches are\r\npaying her homage in their acceptance of the false sabbath, and that they\r\nare preparing to enforce it by the very means which she herself employed\r\nin bygone days. Those who reject the light of truth will yet seek the aid\r\nof this self-styled infallible power to exalt an institution that\r\noriginated with her. How readily she will come to the help of Protestants\r\nin this work, it is not difficult to conjecture. Who understands better\r\nthan the papal leaders how to deal with those who are disobedient to the\r\nchurch?\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic Church, with all its ramifications throughout the\r\nworld, forms one vast organization, under the control, and designed to\r\nserve the interests, of the papal see. Its millions of communicants, in\r\nevery country on the globe, are instructed to hold themselves as bound in\r\nallegiance to the pope. Whatever their nationality or their government,\r\nthey are to regard the authority of the church as above all other. Though\r\nthey may take the oath pledging their loyalty to the state, yet back of\r\nthis lies the vow of obedience to Rome, absolving them from every pledge\r\ninimical to her interests.\r\n\r\nHistory testifies of her artful and persistent efforts to insinuate\r\nherself into the affairs of nations; and having gained a foothold, to\r\nfurther her own aims, even at the ruin of princes and people. In the year\r\n1204, Pope Innocent III. extracted from Peter II., king of Arragon, the\r\nfollowing extraordinary oath: “I, Peter, king of Arragonians, profess and\r\npromise to be ever faithful and obedient to my lord, Pope Innocent, to his\r\nCatholic successors, and the Roman Church, and faithfully to preserve my\r\nkingdom in his obedience, defending the Catholic faith, and persecuting\r\nheretical pravity.”(1021) This is in harmony with the claims regarding the\r\npower of the Roman pontiff, that “it is lawful for him to depose\r\nemperors,” and that “he can absolve subjects from their allegiance to\r\nunrighteous rulers.”(1022)\r\n\r\nAnd let it be remembered, it is the boast of Rome that she never changes.\r\nThe principles of Gregory VII. and Innocent III. are still the principles\r\nof the Roman Catholic Church. And had she but the power, she would put\r\nthem in practice with as much vigor now as in past centuries. Protestants\r\nlittle know what they are doing when they propose to accept the aid of\r\nRome in the work of Sunday exaltation. While they are bent upon the\r\naccomplishment of their purpose, Rome is aiming to re-establish her power,\r\nto recover her lost supremacy. Let the principle once be established in\r\nthe United States, that the church may employ or control the power of the\r\nstate; that religious observances may be enforced by secular laws; in\r\nshort, that the authority of church and state is to dominate the\r\nconscience, and the triumph of Rome in this country is assured.\r\n\r\nGod’s word has given warning of the impending danger; let this be\r\nunheeded, and the Protestant world will learn what the purposes of Rome\r\nreally are, only when it is too late to escape the snare. She is silently\r\ngrowing into power. Her doctrines are exerting their influence in\r\nlegislative halls, in the churches, and in the hearts of men. She is\r\npiling up her lofty and massive structures, in the secret recesses of\r\nwhich her former persecutions will be repeated. Stealthily and\r\nunsuspectedly she is strengthening her forces to further her own ends when\r\nthe time shall come for her to strike. All that she desires is\r\nvantage-ground, and this is already being given her. We shall soon see and\r\nshall feel what the purpose of the Roman element is. Whoever shall believe\r\nand obey the word of God, will thereby incur reproach and persecution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n36. THE IMPENDING CONFLICT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of the great controversy in heaven, it has been\r\nSatan’s purpose to overthrow the law of God. It was to accomplish this\r\nthat he entered upon his rebellion against the Creator; and though he was\r\ncast out of heaven, he has continued the same warfare upon the earth. To\r\ndeceive men, and thus lead them to transgress God’s law, is the object\r\nwhich he has steadfastly pursued. Whether this be accomplished by casting\r\naside the law altogether, or by rejecting one of its precepts, the result\r\nwill be ultimately the same. He that offends “in one point,” manifests\r\ncontempt for the whole law; his influence and example are on the side of\r\ntransgression; he becomes “guilty of all.”(1023)\r\n\r\nIn seeking to cast contempt upon the divine statutes, Satan has perverted\r\nthe doctrines of the Bible, and errors have thus become incorporated into\r\nthe faith of thousands who profess to believe the Scriptures. The last\r\ngreat conflict between truth and error is but the final struggle of the\r\nlong-standing controversy concerning the law of God. Upon this battle we\r\nare now entering,—a battle between the laws of men and the precepts of\r\nJehovah, between the religion of the Bible and the religion of fable and\r\ntradition.\r\n\r\nThe agencies which will unite against truth and righteousness in this\r\ncontest are now actively at work. God’s holy word, which has been handed\r\ndown to us at such a cost of suffering and blood, is but little valued.\r\nThe Bible is within the reach of all, but there are few who really accept\r\nit as the guide of life. Infidelity prevails to an alarming extent, not in\r\nthe world merely, but in the church. Many have come to deny doctrines\r\nwhich are the very pillars of the Christian faith. The great facts of\r\ncreation as presented by the inspired writers, the fall of man, the\r\natonement, and the perpetuity of the law of God, are practically rejected,\r\neither wholly or in part, by a large share of the professedly Christian\r\nworld. Thousands who pride themselves upon their wisdom and independence,\r\nregard it an evidence of weakness to place implicit confidence in the\r\nBible; they think it a proof of superior talent and learning to cavil at\r\nthe Scriptures, and to spiritualize and explain away their most important\r\ntruths. Many ministers are teaching their people, and many professors and\r\nteachers are instructing their students, that the law of God has been\r\nchanged or abrogated; and those who regard its requirements as still\r\nvalid, to be literally obeyed, are thought to be deserving only of\r\nridicule or contempt.\r\n\r\nIn rejecting the truth, men reject its Author. In trampling upon the law\r\nof God, they deny the authority of the Lawgiver. It is as easy to make an\r\nidol of false doctrines and theories as to fashion an idol of wood or\r\nstone. By misrepresenting the attributes of God, Satan leads men to\r\nconceive of Him in a false character. With many, a philosophical idol is\r\nenthroned in the place of Jehovah; while the living God, as He is revealed\r\nin His word, in Christ, and in the works of creation, is worshiped by but\r\nfew. Thousands deify nature, while they deny the God of nature. Though in\r\na different form, idolatry exists in the Christian world to-day as verily\r\nas it existed among ancient Israel in the days of Elijah. The god of many\r\nprofessedly wise men, of philosophers, poets, politicians,\r\njournalists,—the god of polished fashionable circles, of many colleges and\r\nuniversities, even of some theological institutions,—is little better than\r\nBaal, the sun-god of Phenicia.\r\n\r\nNo error accepted by the Christian world strikes more boldly against the\r\nauthority of Heaven, none is more directly opposed to the dictates of\r\nreason, none is more pernicious in its results, than the modern doctrine,\r\nso rapidly gaining ground, that God’s law is no longer binding upon men.\r\nEvery nation has its laws, which command respect and obedience; no\r\ngovernment could exist without them; and can it be conceived that the\r\nCreator of the heavens and the earth has no law to govern the beings He\r\nhas made? Suppose that prominent ministers were publicly to teach that the\r\nstatutes which govern their land and protect the rights of its citizens\r\nwere not obligatory,—that they restricted the liberties of the people, and\r\ntherefore ought not to be obeyed; how long would such men be tolerated in\r\nthe pulpit? But is it a graver offense to disregard the laws of states and\r\nnations than to trample upon those divine precepts which are the\r\nfoundation of all government?\r\n\r\nIt would be far more consistent for nations to abolish their statutes, and\r\npermit the people to do as they please, than for the Ruler of the universe\r\nto annul His law, and leave the world without a standard to condemn the\r\nguilty or justify the obedient. Would we know the result of making void\r\nthe law of God? The experiment has been tried. Terrible were the scenes\r\nenacted in France when atheism became the controlling power. It was then\r\ndemonstrated to the world that to throw off the restraints which God has\r\nimposed is to accept the rule of the cruelest of tyrants. When the\r\nstandard of righteousness is set aside, the way is open for the prince of\r\nevil to establish his power in the earth.\r\n\r\nWherever the divine precepts are rejected, sin ceases to appear sinful, or\r\nrighteousness desirable. Those who refuse to submit to the government of\r\nGod are wholly unfitted to govern themselves. Through their pernicious\r\nteachings, the spirit of insubordination is implanted in the hearts of\r\nchildren and youth, who are naturally impatient of control; and a lawless,\r\nlicentious state of society results. While scoffing at the credulity of\r\nthose who obey the requirements of God, the multitudes eagerly accept the\r\ndelusions of Satan. They give the rein to lust, and practise the sins\r\nwhich have called down judgments upon the heathen.\r\n\r\nThose who teach the people to regard lightly the commandments of God, sow\r\ndisobedience, to reap disobedience. Let the restraint imposed by the\r\ndivine law be wholly cast aside, and human laws would soon be disregarded.\r\nBecause God forbids dishonest practices, coveting, lying, and defrauding,\r\nmen are ready to trample upon His statutes as a hindrance to their worldly\r\nprosperity; but the results of banishing these precepts would be such as\r\nthey do not anticipate. If the law were not binding, why should any fear\r\nto transgress? Property would no longer be safe. Men would obtain their\r\nneighbors’ possessions by violence; and the strongest would become\r\nrichest. Life itself would not be respected. The marriage vow would no\r\nlonger stand as a sacred bulwark to protect the family. He who had the\r\npower, would, if he desired, take his neighbor’s wife by violence. The\r\nfifth commandment would be set aside with the fourth. Children would not\r\nshrink from taking the life of their parents, if by so doing they could\r\nobtain the desire of their corrupt hearts. The civilized world would\r\nbecome a horde of robbers and assassins; and peace, rest, and happiness\r\nwould be banished from the earth.\r\n\r\nAlready the doctrine that men are released from obedience to God’s\r\nrequirements has weakened the force of moral obligation, and opened the\r\nflood-gates of iniquity upon the world. Lawlessness, dissipation, and\r\ncorruption are sweeping in upon us like an overwhelming tide. In the\r\nfamily, Satan is at work. His banner waves, even in professedly Christian\r\nhouseholds. There is envy, evil surmising, hypocrisy, estrangement,\r\nemulation, strife, betrayal of sacred trusts, indulgence of lust. The\r\nwhole system of religious principles and doctrines, which should form the\r\nfoundation and framework of social life, seems to be a tottering mass,\r\nready to fall to ruin. The vilest of criminals, when thrown into prison\r\nfor their offenses, are often made the recipients of gifts and attentions,\r\nas if they had attained an enviable distinction. Great publicity is given\r\nto their character and crimes. The press publishes the revolting details\r\nof vice, thus initiating others into the practice of fraud, robbery, and\r\nmurder; and Satan exults in the success of his hellish schemes. The\r\ninfatuation of vice, the wanton taking of life, the terrible increase of\r\nintemperance and iniquity of every order and degree, should arouse all who\r\nfear God, to inquire what can be done to stay the tide of evil.\r\n\r\nCourts of justice are corrupt. Rulers are actuated by desire for gain, and\r\nlove of sensual pleasure. Intemperance has beclouded the faculties of\r\nmany, so that Satan has almost complete control of them. Jurists are\r\nperverted, bribed, deluded. Drunkenness and revelry, passion, envy,\r\ndishonesty of every sort, are represented among those who administer the\r\nlaws. “Justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and\r\nequity cannot enter.”(1024)\r\n\r\nThe iniquity and spiritual darkness that prevailed under the supremacy of\r\nRome were the inevitable result of her suppression of the Scriptures; but\r\nwhere is to be found the cause of the wide-spread infidelity, the\r\nrejection of the law of God, and the consequent corruption, under the full\r\nblaze of gospel light in an age of religious freedom? Now that Satan can\r\nno longer keep the world under his control by withholding the Scriptures,\r\nhe resorts to other means to accomplish the same object. To destroy faith\r\nin the Bible serves his purpose as well as to destroy the Bible itself. By\r\nintroducing the belief that God’s law is not binding, he as effectually\r\nleads men to transgress as if they were wholly ignorant of its precepts.\r\nAnd now, as in former ages, he has worked through the church to further\r\nhis designs. The religious organizations of the day have refused to listen\r\nto unpopular truths plainly brought to view in the Scriptures, and in\r\ncombating them they have adopted interpretations and taken positions which\r\nhave sown broadcast the seeds of skepticism. Clinging to the papal error\r\nof natural immortality and man’s consciousness in death, they have\r\nrejected the only defense against the delusions of Spiritualism. The\r\ndoctrine of eternal torment has led many to disbelieve the Bible. And as\r\nthe claims of the fourth commandment are urged upon the people, it is\r\nfound that the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath is enjoined; and as\r\nthe only way to free themselves from a duty which they are unwilling to\r\nperform, many popular teachers declare that the law of God is no longer\r\nbinding. Thus they cast away the law and the Sabbath together. As the work\r\nof Sabbath reform extends, this rejection of the divine law to avoid the\r\nclaims of the fourth commandment will become well-nigh universal. The\r\nteachings of religious leaders have opened the door to infidelity, to\r\nSpiritualism, and to contempt for God’s holy law; and upon these leaders\r\nrests a fearful responsibility for the iniquity that exists in the\r\nChristian world.\r\n\r\nYet this very class put forth the claim that the fast-spreading corruption\r\nis largely attributable to the desecration of the so-called “Christian\r\nsabbath,” and that the enforcement of Sunday observance would greatly\r\nimprove the morals of society. This claim is especially urged in America,\r\nwhere the doctrine of the true Sabbath has been most widely preached. Here\r\nthe temperance work, one of the most prominent and important of moral\r\nreforms, is often combined with the Sunday movement, and the advocates of\r\nthe latter represent themselves as laboring to promote the highest\r\ninterest of society; and those who refuse to unite with them are denounced\r\nas the enemies of temperance and reform. But the fact that a movement to\r\nestablish error is connected with a work which is in itself good, is not\r\nan argument in favor of the error. We may disguise poison by mingling it\r\nwith wholesome food, but we do not change its nature. On the contrary, it\r\nis rendered more dangerous, as it is more likely to be taken unawares. It\r\nis one of Satan’s devices to combine with falsehood just enough truth to\r\ngive it plausibility. The leaders of the Sunday movement may advocate\r\nreforms which the people need, principles which are in harmony with the\r\nBible; yet while there is with these a requirement which is contrary to\r\nGod’s law, His servants cannot unite with them. Nothing can justify them\r\nin setting aside the commandments of God for the precepts of men.\r\n\r\nThrough the two great errors, the immortality of the soul and Sunday\r\nsacredness, Satan will bring the people under his deceptions. While the\r\nformer lays the foundation of Spiritualism, the latter creates a bond of\r\nsympathy with Rome. The Protestants of the United States will be foremost\r\nin stretching their hands across the gulf to grasp the hand of\r\nSpiritualism; they will reach over the abyss to clasp hands with the Roman\r\npower; and under the influence of this threefold union, this country will\r\nfollow in the steps of Rome in trampling on the rights of conscience.\r\n\r\nAs Spiritualism more closely imitates the nominal Christianity of the day,\r\nit has greater power to deceive and ensnare. Satan himself is converted,\r\nafter the modern order of things. He will appear in the character of an\r\nangel of light. Through the agency of Spiritualism, miracles will be\r\nwrought, the sick will be healed, and many undeniable wonders will be\r\nperformed. And as the spirits will profess faith in the Bible, and\r\nmanifest respect for the institutions of the church, their work will be\r\naccepted as a manifestation of divine power.\r\n\r\nThe line of distinction between professed Christians and the ungodly is\r\nnow hardly distinguishable. Church-members love what the world loves, and\r\nare ready to join with them; and Satan determines to unite them in one\r\nbody, and thus strengthen his cause by sweeping all into the ranks of\r\nSpiritualism. Papists, who boast of miracles as a certain sign of the true\r\nchurch, will be readily deceived by this wonder-working power; and\r\nProtestants, having cast away the shield of truth, will also be deluded.\r\nPapists, Protestants, and worldlings will alike accept the form of\r\ngodliness without the power, and they will see in this union a grand\r\nmovement for the conversion of the world, and the ushering in of the\r\nlong-expected millennium.\r\n\r\nThrough Spiritualism, Satan appears as a benefactor of the race, healing\r\nthe diseases of the people, and professing to present a new and more\r\nexalted system of religious faith; but at the same time he works as a\r\ndestroyer. His temptations are leading multitudes to ruin. Intemperance\r\ndethrones reason; sensual indulgence, strife, and bloodshed follow. Satan\r\ndelights in war; for it excites the worst passions of the soul, and then\r\nsweeps into eternity its victims steeped in vice and blood. It is his\r\nobject to incite the nations to war against one another; for he can thus\r\ndivert the minds of the people from the work of preparation to stand in\r\nthe day of God.\r\n\r\nSatan works through the elements also to garner his harvest of unprepared\r\nsouls. He has studied the secrets of the laboratories of nature, and he\r\nuses all his power to control the elements as far as God allows. When he\r\nwas suffered to afflict Job, how quickly flocks and herds, servants,\r\nhouses, children, were swept away, one trouble succeeding another as in a\r\nmoment. It is God that shields His creatures, and hedges them in from the\r\npower of the destroyer. But the Christian world have shown contempt for\r\nthe law of Jehovah; and the Lord will do just what He has declared that He\r\nwould,—He will withdraw His blessings from the earth, and remove His\r\nprotecting care from those who are rebelling against His law, and teaching\r\nand forcing others to do the same. Satan has control of all whom God does\r\nnot especially guard. He will favor and prosper some, in order to further\r\nhis own designs; and he will bring trouble upon others, and lead men to\r\nbelieve that it is God who is afflicting them.\r\n\r\nWhile appearing to the children of men as a great physician who can heal\r\nall their maladies, he will bring disease and disaster, until populous\r\ncities are reduced to ruin and desolation. Even now he is at work. In\r\naccidents and calamities by sea and by land, in great conflagrations, in\r\nfierce tornadoes and terrific hail-storms, in tempests, floods, cyclones,\r\ntidal waves, and earthquakes, in every place and in a thousand forms,\r\nSatan is exercising his power. He sweeps away the ripening harvest, and\r\nfamine and distress follow. He imparts to the air a deadly taint, and\r\nthousands perish by the pestilence. These visitations are to become more\r\nand more frequent and disastrous. Destruction will be upon both man and\r\nbeast. “The earth mourneth and fadeth away,” “the haughty people ... do\r\nlanguish. The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because\r\nthey have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the\r\neverlasting covenant.”(1025)\r\n\r\nAnd then the great deceiver will persuade men that those who serve God are\r\ncausing these evils. The class that have provoked the displeasure of\r\nHeaven will charge all their troubles upon those whose obedience to God’s\r\ncommandments is a perpetual reproof to transgressors. It will be declared\r\nthat men are offending God by the violation of the Sunday-sabbath; that\r\nthis sin has brought calamities which will not cease until Sunday\r\nobservance shall be strictly enforced; and that those who present the\r\nclaims of the fourth commandment, thus destroying reverence for Sunday,\r\nare troublers of the people, preventing their restoration to divine favor\r\nand temporal prosperity. Thus the accusation urged of old against the\r\nservant of God will be repeated, and upon grounds equally well\r\nestablished: “And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said\r\nunto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel? And he answered, I have not\r\ntroubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have\r\nforsaken the commandments of the Lord, and thou hast followed\r\nBaalim.”(1026) As the wrath of the people shall be excited by false\r\ncharges, they will pursue a course toward God’s ambassadors very similar\r\nto that which apostate Israel pursued toward Elijah.\r\n\r\nThe miracle-working power manifested through Spiritualism will exert its\r\ninfluence against those who choose to obey God rather than men.\r\nCommunications from the spirits will declare that God has sent them to\r\nconvince the rejecters of Sunday of their error, affirming that the laws\r\nof the land should be obeyed as the law of God. They will lament the great\r\nwickedness in the world, and second the testimony of religious teachers,\r\nthat the degraded state of morals is caused by the desecration of Sunday.\r\nGreat will be the indignation excited against all who refuse to accept\r\ntheir testimony.\r\n\r\nSatan’s policy in this final conflict with God’s people is the same that\r\nhe employed in the opening of the great controversy in heaven. He\r\nprofessed to be seeking to promote the stability of the divine government,\r\nwhile secretly bending every effort to secure its overthrow. And the very\r\nwork which he was thus endeavoring to accomplish, he charged upon the\r\nloyal angels. The same policy of deception has marked the history of the\r\nRoman Church. It has professed to act as the vicegerent of Heaven, while\r\nseeking to exalt itself above God, and to change His law. Under the rule\r\nof Rome, those who suffered death for their fidelity to the gospel were\r\ndenounced as evil-doers; they were declared to be in league with Satan;\r\nand every possible means was employed to cover them with reproach, to\r\ncause them to appear, in the eyes of the people, and even to themselves,\r\nas the vilest of criminals. So it will be now. While Satan seeks to\r\ndestroy those who honor God’s law, he will cause them to be accused as\r\nlawbreakers, as men who are dishonoring God, and bringing judgments upon\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nGod never forces the will or the conscience; but Satan’s constant\r\nresort—to gain control of those whom he cannot otherwise seduce—is\r\ncompulsion by cruelty. Through fear or force he endeavors to rule the\r\nconscience, and to secure homage to himself. To accomplish this, he works\r\nthrough both religious and secular authorities, moving them to the\r\nenforcement of human laws in defiance of the law of God.\r\n\r\nThose who honor the Bible Sabbath will be denounced as enemies of law and\r\norder, as breaking down the moral restraints of society, causing anarchy\r\nand corruption, and calling down the judgments of God upon the earth.\r\nTheir conscientious scruples will be pronounced obstinacy, stubbornness,\r\nand contempt of authority. They will be accused of disaffection toward the\r\ngovernment. Ministers who deny the obligation of the divine law will\r\npresent from the pulpit the duty of yielding obedience to the civil\r\nauthorities as ordained of God. In legislative halls and courts of\r\njustice, commandment-keepers will be misrepresented and condemned. A false\r\ncoloring will be given to their words; the worst construction will be put\r\nupon their motives.\r\n\r\nAs the Protestant churches reject the clear, scriptural arguments in\r\ndefense of God’s law, they will long to silence those whose faith they\r\ncannot overthrow by the Bible. Though they blind their own eyes to the\r\nfact, they are now adopting a course which will lead to the persecution of\r\nthose who conscientiously refuse to do what the rest of the Christian\r\nworld are doing, and acknowledge the claims of the papal sabbath.\r\n\r\nThe dignitaries of church and state will unite to bribe, persuade, or\r\ncompel all classes to honor the Sunday. The lack of divine authority will\r\nbe supplied by oppressive enactments. Political corruption is destroying\r\nlove of justice and regard for truth; and even in free America, rulers and\r\nlegislators, in order to secure public favor, will yield to the popular\r\ndemand for a law enforcing Sunday observance. Liberty of conscience, which\r\nhas cost so great a sacrifice, will no longer be respected. In the\r\nsoon-coming conflict we shall see exemplified the prophet’s words, “The\r\ndragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of\r\nher seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of\r\nJesus Christ.”(1027)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n37. THE SCRIPTURES A SAFEGUARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\n“To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this\r\nword, it is because there is no light in them.”(1028) The people of God\r\nare directed to the Scriptures as their safeguard against the influence of\r\nfalse teachers and the delusive power of spirits of darkness. Satan\r\nemploys every possible device to prevent men from obtaining a knowledge of\r\nthe Bible; for its plain utterances reveal his deceptions. At every\r\nrevival of God’s work, the prince of evil is aroused to more intense\r\nactivity; he is now putting forth his utmost efforts for a final struggle\r\nagainst Christ and His followers. The last great delusion is soon to open\r\nbefore us. Antichrist is to perform his marvelous works in our sight. So\r\nclosely will the counterfeit resemble the true, that it will be impossible\r\nto distinguish between them except by the Holy Scriptures. By their\r\ntestimony every statement and every miracle must be tested.\r\n\r\nThose who endeavor to obey all the commandments of God will be opposed and\r\nderided. They can stand only in God. In order to endure the trial before\r\nthem, they must understand the will of God as revealed in His word; they\r\ncan honor Him only as they have a right conception of His character,\r\ngovernment, and purposes, and act in accordance with them. None but those\r\nwho have fortified the mind with the truths of the Bible will stand\r\nthrough the last great conflict. To every soul will come the searching\r\ntest, Shall I obey God rather than men? The decisive hour is even now at\r\nhand. Are our feet planted on the rock of God’s immutable word? Are we\r\nprepared to stand firm in defense of the commandments of God and the faith\r\nof Jesus?\r\n\r\nBefore His crucifixion, the Saviour explained to His disciples that He was\r\nto be put to death, and to rise again from the tomb; and angels were\r\npresent to impress His words on minds and hearts. But the disciples were\r\nlooking for temporal deliverance from the Roman yoke, and they could not\r\ntolerate the thought that He in whom all their hopes centered should\r\nsuffer an ignominious death. The words which they needed to remember were\r\nbanished from their minds; and when the time of trial came, it found them\r\nunprepared. The death of Jesus as fully destroyed their hopes as if He had\r\nnot forewarned them. So in the prophecies the future is opened before us\r\nas plainly as it was opened to the disciples by the words of Christ. The\r\nevents connected with the close of probation and the work of preparation\r\nfor the time of trouble, are clearly presented. But multitudes have no\r\nmore understanding of these important truths than if they had never been\r\nrevealed. Satan watches to catch away every impression that would make\r\nthem wise unto salvation, and the time of trouble will find them unready.\r\n\r\nWhen God sends to men warnings so important that they are represented as\r\nproclaimed by holy angels flying in the midst of heaven, He requires every\r\nperson endowed with reasoning powers to heed the message. The fearful\r\njudgments denounced against the worship of the beast and his image,(1029)\r\nshould lead all to a diligent study of the prophecies to learn what the\r\nmark of the beast is, and how they are to avoid receiving it. But the\r\nmasses of the people turn away their ears from hearing the truth, and are\r\nturned unto fables. The apostle Paul declared, looking down to the last\r\ndays, “The time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine.”(1030)\r\nThat time has fully come. The multitudes do not want Bible truth, because\r\nit interferes with the desires of the sinful, world-loving heart; and\r\nSatan supplies the deceptions which they love.\r\n\r\nBut God will have a people upon the earth to maintain the Bible, and the\r\nBible only, as the standard of all doctrines, and the basis of all\r\nreforms. The opinions of learned men, the deductions of science, the\r\ncreeds or decisions of ecclesiastical councils, as numerous and discordant\r\nas are the churches which they represent, the voice of the majority,—not\r\none nor all of these should be regarded as evidence for or against any\r\npoint of religious faith. Before accepting any doctrine or precept, we\r\nshould demand a plain “Thus saith the Lord” in its support.\r\n\r\nSatan is constantly endeavoring to attract attention to man in the place\r\nof God. He leads the people to look to bishops, to pastors, to professors\r\nof theology, as their guides, instead of searching the Scriptures to learn\r\ntheir duty for themselves. Then, by controlling the minds of these\r\nleaders, he can influence the multitudes according to his will.\r\n\r\nWhen Christ came to speak the words of life, the common people heard Him\r\ngladly; and many, even of the priests and rulers, believed on Him. But the\r\nchief of the priesthood and the leading men of the nation were determined\r\nto condemn and repudiate His teachings. Though they were baffled in all\r\ntheir efforts to find accusations against Him, though they could not but\r\nfeel the influence of the divine power and wisdom attending His words, yet\r\nthey encased themselves in prejudice; they rejected the clearest evidence\r\nof His Messiahship, lest they should be forced to become His disciples.\r\nThese opponents of Jesus were men whom the people had been taught from\r\ninfancy to reverence, to whose authority they had been accustomed\r\nimplicitly to bow. “How is it,” they asked, “that our rulers and learned\r\nscribes do not believe on Jesus? Would not these pious men receive Him if\r\nHe were the Christ?” It was the influence of such teachers that led the\r\nJewish nation to reject their Redeemer.\r\n\r\nThe spirit which actuated those priests and rulers is still manifested by\r\nmany who make a high profession of piety. They refuse to examine the\r\ntestimony of the Scriptures concerning the special truths for this time.\r\nThey point to their own numbers, wealth, and popularity, and look with\r\ncontempt upon the advocates of truth as few, poor, and unpopular, having a\r\nfaith that separates them from the world.\r\n\r\nChrist foresaw that the undue assumption of authority indulged by the\r\nscribes and Pharisees would not cease with the dispersion of the Jews. He\r\nhad a prophetic view of the work of exalting human authority to rule the\r\nconscience, which has been so terrible a curse to the church in all ages.\r\nAnd His fearful denunciations of the scribes and Pharisees, and His\r\nwarnings to the people not to follow these blind leaders, were placed on\r\nrecord as an admonition to future generations.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Church reserves to the clergy the right to interpret the\r\nScriptures. On the ground that ecclesiastics alone are competent to\r\nexplain God’s word, it is withheld from the common people. Though the\r\nReformation gave the Scriptures to all, yet the selfsame principle which\r\nwas maintained by Rome prevents multitudes in Protestant churches from\r\nsearching the Bible for themselves. They are taught to accept its\r\nteachings _as interpreted by the church_; and there are thousands who dare\r\nreceive nothing, however plainly revealed in Scripture, that is contrary\r\nto their creed, or the established teaching of their church.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the Bible is full of warnings against false teachers, many\r\nare ready thus to commit the keeping of their souls to the clergy. There\r\nare to-day thousands of professors of religion who can give no other\r\nreason for points of faith which they hold than that they were so\r\ninstructed by their religious leaders. They pass by the Saviour’s\r\nteachings almost unnoticed, and place implicit confidence in the words of\r\nthe ministers. But are ministers infallible? How can we trust our souls to\r\ntheir guidance unless we know from God’s word that they are light-bearers?\r\nA lack of moral courage to step aside from the beaten track of the world,\r\nleads many to follow in the steps of learned men; and by their reluctance\r\nto investigate for themselves, they are becoming hopelessly fastened in\r\nthe chains of error. They see that the truth for this time is plainly\r\nbrought to view in the Bible, and they feel the power of the Holy Spirit\r\nattending its proclamation; yet they allow the opposition of the clergy to\r\nturn them from the light. Though reason and conscience are convinced,\r\nthese deluded souls dare not think differently from the minister; and\r\ntheir individual judgment, their eternal interests, are sacrificed to the\r\nunbelief, the pride and prejudice, of another.\r\n\r\nMany are the ways by which Satan works through human influence to bind his\r\ncaptives. He secures multitudes to himself by attaching them by the silken\r\ncords of affection to those who are enemies of the cross of Christ.\r\nWhatever this attachment may be, parental, filial, conjugal, or social,\r\nthe effect is the same; the opposers of truth exert their power to control\r\nthe conscience, and the souls held under their sway have not sufficient\r\ncourage or independence to obey their own convictions of duty.\r\n\r\nThe truth and the glory of God are inseparable; it is impossible for us,\r\nwith the Bible within our reach, to honor God by erroneous opinions. Many\r\nclaim that it matters not what one believes, if his life is only right.\r\nBut the life is moulded by the faith. If light and truth is within our\r\nreach, and we neglect to improve the privilege of hearing and seeing it,\r\nwe virtually reject it; we are choosing darkness rather than light.\r\n\r\n“There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the\r\nways of death.”(1031) Ignorance is no excuse for error or sin, when there\r\nis every opportunity to know the will of God. A man is traveling, and\r\ncomes to a place where there are several roads, and a guide-board\r\nindicating where each one leads. If he disregards the guide-board, and\r\ntakes whichever road seems to him to be right, he may be ever so sincere,\r\nbut will in all probability find himself on the wrong road.\r\n\r\nGod has given us His word that we may become acquainted with its\r\nteachings, and know for ourselves what He requires of us. When the lawyer\r\ncame to Jesus with the inquiry, “What shall I do to inherit eternal life?”\r\nthe Saviour referred him to the Scriptures, saying, “What is written in\r\nthe law? how readest thou?” Ignorance will not excuse young or old, nor\r\nrelease them from the punishment due for the transgression of God’s law;\r\nbecause there is in their hands a faithful presentation of that law and of\r\nits principles and its claims. It is not enough to have good intentions;\r\nit is not enough to do what a man thinks is right, or what the minister\r\ntells him is right. His soul’s salvation is at stake, and he should search\r\nthe Scriptures for himself. However strong may be his convictions, however\r\nconfident he may be that the minister knows what is truth, this is not his\r\nfoundation. He has a chart pointing out every way mark on the heavenward\r\njourney, and he ought not to guess at anything.\r\n\r\nIt is the first and highest duty of every rational being to learn from the\r\nScriptures what is truth, and then to walk in the light, and encourage\r\nothers to follow his example. We should day by day study the Bible\r\ndiligently, weighing every thought, and comparing scripture with\r\nscripture. With divine help, we are to form our opinions for ourselves, as\r\nwe are to answer for ourselves before God.\r\n\r\nThe truths most plainly revealed in the Bible have been involved in doubt\r\nand darkness by learned men, who, with a pretense of great wisdom, teach\r\nthat the Scriptures have a mystical, a secret, spiritual meaning not\r\napparent in the language employed. These men are false teachers. It was to\r\nsuch a class that Jesus declared, “Ye know not the Scriptures, neither the\r\npower of God.”(1032) The language of the Bible should be explained\r\naccording to its obvious meaning, unless a symbol or figure is employed.\r\nChrist has given the promise, “If any man will do His will, he shall know\r\nof the doctrine.”(1033) If men would but take the Bible as it reads, if\r\nthere were no false teachers to mislead and confuse their minds, a work\r\nwould be accomplished that would make angels glad, and that would bring\r\ninto the fold of Christ thousands upon thousands who are now wandering in\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nWe should exert all the powers of the mind in the study of the Scriptures,\r\nand should task the understanding to comprehend, as far as mortals can,\r\nthe deep things of God; yet we must not forget that the docility and\r\nsubmission of a child is the true spirit of the learner. Scriptural\r\ndifficulties can never be mastered by the same methods that are employed\r\nin grappling with philosophical problems. We should not engage in the\r\nstudy of the Bible with that self-reliance with which so many enter the\r\ndomains of science, but with a prayerful dependence upon God, and a\r\nsincere desire to learn His will. We must come with a humble and teachable\r\nspirit to obtain knowledge from the great I AM. Otherwise, evil angels\r\nwill so blind our minds and harden our hearts that we shall not be\r\nimpressed by the truth.\r\n\r\nMany a portion of Scripture which learned men pronounce a mystery, or pass\r\nover as unimportant, is full of comfort and instruction to him who has\r\nbeen taught in the school of Christ. One reason why many theologians have\r\nno clearer understanding of God’s word is, they close their eyes to truths\r\nwhich they do not wish to practise. An understanding of Bible truth\r\ndepends not so much on the power of intellect brought to the search as on\r\nthe singleness of purpose, the earnest longing after righteousness.\r\n\r\nThe Bible should never be studied without prayer. The Holy Spirit alone\r\ncan cause us to feel the importance of those things easy to be understood,\r\nor prevent us from wresting truths difficult of comprehension. It is the\r\noffice of heavenly angels to prepare the heart so to comprehend God’s word\r\nthat we shall be charmed with its beauty, admonished by its warnings, or\r\nanimated and strengthened by its promises. We should make the psalmist’s\r\npetition our own, “Open Thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things\r\nout of Thy law.”(1034) Temptations often appear irresistible because,\r\nthrough neglect of prayer and the study of the Bible, the tempted one\r\ncannot readily remember God’s promises and meet Satan with the Scripture\r\nweapons. But angels are round about those who are willing to be taught in\r\ndivine things; and in the time of great necessity, they will bring to\r\ntheir remembrance the very truths which are needed. Thus “when the enemy\r\nshall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a\r\nstandard against him.”(1035)\r\n\r\nJesus promised His disciples, “The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost,\r\nwhom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things, and\r\nbring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto\r\nyou.”(1036) But the teachings of Christ must previously have been stored\r\nin the mind, in order for the Spirit of God to bring them to our\r\nremembrance in the time of peril. “Thy word have I hid in mine heart,”\r\nsaid David, “that I might not sin against Thee.”(1037)\r\n\r\nAll who value their eternal interests should be on their guard against the\r\ninroads of skepticism. The very pillars of truth will be assailed. It is\r\nimpossible to keep beyond the reach of the sarcasms and sophisms, the\r\ninsidious and pestilent teachings, of modern infidelity. Satan adapts his\r\ntemptations to all classes. He assails the illiterate with a jest or\r\nsneer, while he meets the educated with scientific objections and\r\nphilosophical reasoning, alike calculated to excite distrust or contempt\r\nof the Scriptures. Even youth of little experience presume to insinuate\r\ndoubts concerning the fundamental principles of Christianity. And this\r\nyouthful infidelity, shallow as it is, has its influence. Many are thus\r\nled to jest at the faith of their fathers, and to do despite to the Spirit\r\nof grace.(1038) Many a life that promised to be an honor to God and a\r\nblessing to the world, has been blighted by the foul breath of infidelity.\r\nAll who trust to the boastful decisions of human reason, and imagine that\r\nthey can explain divine mysteries, and arrive at truth unaided by the\r\nwisdom of God, are entangled in the snare of Satan.\r\n\r\nWe are living in the most solemn period of this world’s history. The\r\ndestiny of earth’s teeming multitudes is about to be decided. Our own\r\nfuture well-being, and also the salvation of other souls, depend upon the\r\ncourse which we now pursue. We need to be guided by the Spirit of truth.\r\nEvery follower of Christ should earnestly inquire, “Lord, what wilt Thou\r\nhave me to do?” We need to humble ourselves before the Lord, with fasting\r\nand prayer, and to meditate much upon His word, especially upon the scenes\r\nof the judgment. We should now seek a deep and living experience in the\r\nthings of God. We have not a moment to lose. Events of vital importance\r\nare taking place around us; we are on Satan’s enchanted ground. Sleep not,\r\nsentinels of God; the foe is lurking near, ready at any moment, should you\r\nbecome lax and drowsy, to spring upon you and make you his prey.\r\n\r\nMany are deceived as to their true condition before God. They congratulate\r\nthemselves upon the wrong acts which they do not commit, and forget to\r\nenumerate the good and noble deeds which God requires of them, but which\r\nthey have neglected to perform. It is not enough that they are trees in\r\nthe garden of God. They are to answer His expectation by bearing fruit. He\r\nholds them accountable for their failure to accomplish all the good which\r\nthey could have done, through His grace strengthening them. In the books\r\nof heaven they are registered as cumberers of the ground. Yet the case of\r\neven this class is not utterly hopeless. With those who have slighted\r\nGod’s mercy and abused His grace, the heart of long-suffering Love yet\r\npleads. “Wherefore He saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the\r\ndead, and Christ shall give thee light. See then that ye walk\r\ncircumspectly, ... redeeming the time, because the days are evil.”(1039)\r\n\r\nWhen the testing time shall come, those who have made God’s word their\r\nrule of life will be revealed. In summer there is no noticeable difference\r\nbetween evergreens and other trees; but when the blasts of winter come,\r\nthe evergreens remain unchanged, while other trees are stripped of their\r\nfoliage. So the false-hearted professor may not now be distinguished from\r\nthe real Christian, but the time is just upon us when the difference will\r\nbe apparent. Let opposition arise, let bigotry and intolerance again bear\r\nsway, let persecution be kindled, and the half-hearted and hypocritical\r\nwill waver and yield the faith; but the true Christian will stand firm as\r\na rock, his faith stronger, his hope brighter, than in days of prosperity.\r\n\r\nSays the psalmist: “Thy testimonies are my meditation.” “Through Thy\r\nprecepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.”(1040)\r\n\r\n“Happy is the man that findeth wisdom.” “He shall be as a tree planted by\r\nthe waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not\r\nsee when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be\r\ncareful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding\r\nfruit.”(1041)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n38. THE FINAL WARNING.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\n“I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the\r\nearth was lightened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong\r\nvoice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the\r\nhabitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of\r\nevery unclean and hateful bird.” “And I heard another voice from heaven,\r\nsaying, Come out of her, My people, that ye be not partakers of her sins,\r\nand that ye receive not of her plagues.”(1042)\r\n\r\nThis scripture points forward to a time when the announcement of the fall\r\nof Babylon, as made by the second angel(1043) of Revelation 14, is to be\r\nrepeated, with the additional mention of the corruptions which have been\r\nentering the various organizations that constitute Babylon, since that\r\nmessage was first given, in the summer of 1844. A terrible condition of\r\nthe religious world is here described. With every rejection of truth, the\r\nminds of the people will become darker, their hearts more stubborn, until\r\nthey are entrenched in an infidel hardihood. In defiance of the warnings\r\nwhich God has given, they will continue to trample upon one of the\r\nprecepts of the decalogue, until they are led to persecute those who hold\r\nit sacred. Christ is set at naught in the contempt placed upon His word\r\nand His people. As the teachings of Spiritualism are accepted by the\r\nchurches, the restraint imposed upon the carnal heart is removed, and the\r\nprofession of religion will become a cloak to conceal the basest iniquity.\r\nA belief in spiritual manifestations opens the door to seducing spirits,\r\nand doctrines of devils, and thus the influence of evil angels will be\r\nfelt in the churches.\r\n\r\nOf Babylon, at the time brought to view in this prophecy, it is declared,\r\n“Her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her\r\niniquities.”(1044) She has filled up the measure of her guilt, and\r\ndestruction is about to fall upon her. But God still has a people in\r\nBabylon; and before the visitation of His judgments, these faithful ones\r\nmust be called out, that they “partake not of her sins, and receive not of\r\nher plagues.” Hence the movement symbolized by the angel coming down from\r\nheaven, lightening the earth with his glory, and crying mightily with a\r\nstrong voice, announcing the sins of Babylon. In connection with his\r\nmessage the call is heard, “Come out of her, My people.” These\r\nannouncements, uniting with the third angel’s message, constitute the\r\nfinal warning to be given to the inhabitants of the earth.\r\n\r\nFearful is the issue to which the world is to be brought. The powers of\r\nearth, uniting to war against the commandments of God, will decree that\r\nall, “both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,”(1045) shall\r\nconform to the customs of the church by the observance of the false\r\nsabbath. All who refuse compliance will be visited with civil penalties,\r\nand it will finally be declared that they are deserving of death. On the\r\nother hand, the law of God enjoining the Creator’s rest-day demands\r\nobedience, and threatens wrath against all who transgress its precepts.\r\n\r\nWith the issue thus clearly brought before him, whoever shall trample upon\r\nGod’s law to obey a human enactment, receives the mark of the beast; he\r\naccepts the sign of allegiance to the power which he chooses to obey\r\ninstead of God. The warning from heaven is, “If any man worship the beast\r\nand his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the\r\nsame shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out\r\nwithout mixture into the cup of His indignation.”(1046)\r\n\r\nBut not one is made to suffer the wrath of God until the truth has been\r\nbrought home to his mind and conscience, and has been rejected. There are\r\nmany who have never had an opportunity to hear the special truths for this\r\ntime. The obligation of the fourth commandment has never been set before\r\nthem in its true light. He who reads every heart, and tries every motive,\r\nwill leave none who desire a knowledge of the truth, to be deceived as to\r\nthe issues of the controversy. The decree is not to be urged upon the\r\npeople blindly. Every one is to have sufficient light to make his decision\r\nintelligently.\r\n\r\nThe Sabbath will be the great test of loyalty; for it is the point of\r\ntruth especially controverted. When the final test shall be brought to\r\nbear upon men, then the line of distinction will be drawn between those\r\nwho serve God and those who serve Him not. While the observance of the\r\nfalse sabbath in compliance with the law of the state, contrary to the\r\nfourth commandment, will be an avowal of allegiance to a power that is in\r\nopposition to God, the keeping of the true Sabbath, in obedience to God’s\r\nlaw, is an evidence of loyalty to the Creator. While one class, by\r\naccepting the sign of submission to earthly powers, receive the mark of\r\nthe beast, the other, choosing the token of allegiance to divine\r\nauthority, receive the seal of God.\r\n\r\nHeretofore those who presented the truths of the third angel’s message\r\nhave often been regarded as mere alarmists. Their predictions that\r\nreligious intolerance would gain control in the United States, that church\r\nand state would unite to persecute those who keep the commandments of God,\r\nhave been pronounced groundless and absurd. It has been confidently\r\ndeclared that this land could never become other than what it has\r\nbeen,—the defender of religious freedom. But as the question of enforcing\r\nSunday observance is widely agitated, the event so long doubted and\r\ndisbelieved is seen to be approaching, and the third message will produce\r\nan effect which it could not have had before.\r\n\r\nIn every generation God has sent His servants to rebuke sin, both in the\r\nworld and in the church. But the people desire smooth things spoken to\r\nthem, and the pure, unvarnished truth is not acceptable. Many reformers,\r\nin entering upon their work, determined to exercise great prudence in\r\nattacking the sins of the church and the nation. They hoped, by the\r\nexample of a pure Christian life, to lead the people back to the doctrines\r\nof the Bible. But the Spirit of God came upon them as it came upon Elijah,\r\nmoving him to rebuke the sins of a wicked king and an apostate people;\r\nthey could not refrain from preaching the plain utterances of the\r\nBible,—doctrines which they had been reluctant to present. They were\r\nimpelled to zealously declare the truth, and the danger which threatened\r\nsouls. The words which the Lord gave them they uttered, fearless of\r\nconsequences, and the people were compelled to hear the warning.\r\n\r\nThus the message of the third angel will be proclaimed. As the time comes\r\nfor it to be given with greatest power, the Lord will work through humble\r\ninstruments, leading the minds of those who consecrate themselves to His\r\nservice. The laborers will be qualified rather by the unction of His\r\nSpirit than by the training of literary institutions. Men of faith and\r\nprayer will be constrained to go forth with holy zeal, declaring the words\r\nwhich God gives them. The sins of Babylon will be laid open. The fearful\r\nresults of enforcing the observances of the church by civil authority, the\r\ninroads of Spiritualism, the stealthy but rapid progress of the papal\r\npower,—all will be unmasked. By these solemn warnings the people will be\r\nstirred. Thousands upon thousands will listen who have never heard words\r\nlike these.\r\n\r\nIn amazement they hear the testimony that Babylon is the church, fallen\r\nbecause of her errors and sins, because of her rejection of the truth sent\r\nto her from heaven. As the people go to their former teachers with the\r\neager inquiry, Are these things so? the ministers present fables, prophesy\r\nsmooth things, to soothe their fears, and quiet the awakened conscience.\r\nBut since many refuse to be satisfied with the mere authority of men, and\r\ndemand a plain “Thus saith the Lord,” the popular ministry, like the\r\nPharisees of old, filled with anger as their authority is questioned, will\r\ndenounce the message as of Satan, and stir up the sin-loving multitudes to\r\nrevile and persecute those who proclaim it.\r\n\r\nAs the controversy extends into new fields, and the minds of the people\r\nare called to God’s down-trodden law, Satan is astir. The power attending\r\nthe message will only madden those who oppose it. The clergy will put\r\nforth almost superhuman efforts to shut away the light, lest it should\r\nshine upon their flocks. By every means at their command they will\r\nendeavor to suppress the discussion of these vital questions. The church\r\nappeals to the strong arm of civil power, and in this work, papists and\r\nProtestants unite. As the movement for Sunday enforcement becomes more\r\nbold and decided, the law will be invoked against commandment-keepers.\r\nThey will be threatened with fines and imprisonment, and some will be\r\noffered positions of influence, and other rewards and advantages, as\r\ninducements to renounce their faith. But their steadfast answer is, “Show\r\nus from the word of God our error,”—the same plea that was made by Luther\r\nunder similar circumstances. Those who are arraigned before the courts,\r\nmake a strong vindication of the truth, and some who hear them are led to\r\ntake their stand to keep all the commandments of God. Thus light will be\r\nbrought before thousands who otherwise would know nothing of these truths.\r\n\r\nConscientious obedience to the word of God will be treated as rebellion.\r\nBlinded by Satan, the parent will exercise harshness and severity toward\r\nthe believing child; the master or mistress will oppress the\r\ncommandment-keeping servant. Affection will be alienated; children will be\r\ndisinherited, and driven from home. The words of Paul will be literally\r\nfulfilled, “All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer\r\npersecution.”(1047) As the defenders of truth refuse to honor the\r\nSunday-sabbath, some of them will be thrust into prison, some will be\r\nexiled, some will be treated as slaves. To human wisdom, all this now\r\nseems impossible; but as the restraining Spirit of God shall be withdrawn\r\nfrom men, and they shall be under the control of Satan, who hates the\r\ndivine precepts, there will be strange developments. The heart can be very\r\ncruel when God’s fear and love are removed.\r\n\r\nAs the storm approaches, a large class who have professed faith in the\r\nthird angel’s message, but have not been sanctified through obedience to\r\nthe truth, abandon their position, and join the ranks of the opposition.\r\nBy uniting with the world and partaking of its spirit, they have come to\r\nview matters in nearly the same light; and when the test is brought, they\r\nare prepared to choose the easy, popular side. Men of talent and pleasing\r\naddress, who once rejoiced in the truth, employ their powers to deceive\r\nand mislead souls. They become the most bitter enemies of their former\r\nbrethren. When Sabbath-keepers are brought before the courts to answer for\r\ntheir faith, these apostates are the most efficient agents of Satan to\r\nmisrepresent and accuse them, and by false reports and insinuations to\r\nstir up the rulers against them.\r\n\r\nIn this time of persecution the faith of the Lord’s servants will be\r\ntried. They have faithfully given the warning, looking to God and to His\r\nword alone. God’s Spirit, moving upon their hearts, has constrained them\r\nto speak. Stimulated with holy zeal, and with the divine impulse strong\r\nupon them, they entered upon the performance of their duties without\r\ncoldly calculating the consequences of speaking to the people the word\r\nwhich the Lord had given them. They have not consulted their temporal\r\ninterests, nor sought to preserve their reputation or their lives. Yet\r\nwhen the storm of opposition and reproach bursts upon them, some,\r\noverwhelmed with consternation, will be ready to exclaim, “Had we foreseen\r\nthe consequences of our words, we would have held our peace.” They are\r\nhedged in with difficulties. Satan assails them with fierce temptations.\r\nThe work which they have undertaken seems far beyond their ability to\r\naccomplish. They are threatened with destruction. The enthusiasm which\r\nanimated them is gone; yet they cannot turn back. Then, feeling their\r\nutter helplessness, they flee to the Mighty One for strength. They\r\nremember that the words which they have spoken were not theirs, but His\r\nwho bade them give the warning. God put the truth into their hearts, and\r\nthey could not forbear to proclaim it.\r\n\r\nThe same trials have been experienced by men of God in ages past.\r\nWycliffe, Huss, Luther, Tyndale, Baxter, Wesley, urged that all doctrines\r\nbe brought to the test of the Bible, and declared that they would renounce\r\neverything which it condemned. Against these men, persecution raged with\r\nrelentless fury; yet they ceased not to declare the truth. Different\r\nperiods in the history of the church have each been marked by the\r\ndevelopment of some special truth, adapted to the necessities of God’s\r\npeople at that time. Every new truth has made its way against hatred and\r\nopposition; those who were blessed with its light were tempted and tried.\r\nThe Lord gives a special truth for the people in an emergency. Who dare\r\nrefuse to publish it? He commands His servants to present the last\r\ninvitation of mercy to the world. They cannot remain silent, except at the\r\nperil of their souls. Christ’s ambassadors have nothing to do with\r\nconsequences. They must perform their duty, and leave results with God.\r\n\r\nAs the opposition rises to a fiercer height, the servants of God are again\r\nperplexed; for it seems to them that they have brought the crisis. But\r\nconscience and the word of God assure them that their course is right; and\r\nalthough the trials continue, they are strengthened to bear them. The\r\ncontest grows closer and sharper, but their faith and courage rise with\r\nthe emergency. Their testimony is: “We dare not tamper with God’s word,\r\ndividing His holy law; calling one portion essential and another\r\nnon-essential, to gain the favor of the world. The Lord whom we serve is\r\nable to deliver us. Christ has conquered the powers of earth; and shall we\r\nbe afraid of a world already conquered?”\r\n\r\nPersecution in its varied forms is the development of a principle which\r\nwill exist as long as Satan exists and Christianity has vital power. No\r\nman can serve God without enlisting against himself the opposition of the\r\nhosts of darkness. Evil angels will assail him, alarmed that his influence\r\nis taking the prey from their hands. Evil men, rebuked by his example,\r\nwill unite with them in seeking to separate him from God by alluring\r\ntemptations. When these do not succeed, then a compelling power is\r\nemployed to force the conscience.\r\n\r\nBut so long as Jesus remains man’s intercessor in the sanctuary above, the\r\nrestraining influence of the Holy Spirit is felt by rulers and people. It\r\nstill controls, to some extent, the laws of the land. Were it not for\r\nthese laws, the condition of the world would be much worse than it now is.\r\nWhile many of our rulers are active agents of Satan, God also has His\r\nagents among the leading men of the nation. The enemy moves upon his\r\nservants to propose measures that would greatly impede the work of God;\r\nbut statesmen who fear the Lord are influenced by holy angels to oppose\r\nsuch propositions with unanswerable arguments. Thus a few men will hold in\r\ncheck a powerful current of evil. The opposition of the enemies of truth\r\nwill be restrained that the third angel’s message may do its work. When\r\nthe final warning shall be given, it will arrest the attention of these\r\nleading men through whom the Lord is now working, and some of them will\r\naccept it, and will stand with the people of God through the time of\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nThe angel who unites in the proclamation of the third angel’s message, is\r\nto lighten the whole earth with his glory. A work of world-wide extent and\r\nunwonted power is here foretold. The Advent Movement of 1840-44 was a\r\nglorious manifestation of the power of God; the first angel’s message was\r\ncarried to every missionary station in the world, and in some countries\r\nthere was the greatest religious interest which has been witnessed in any\r\nland since the Reformation of the sixteenth century; but these are to be\r\nexceeded by the mighty movement under the last warning of the third angel.\r\n\r\nThe work will be similar to that of the day of Pentecost. As the “former\r\nrain” was given, in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at the opening of\r\nthe gospel, to cause the upspringing of the precious seed, so the “latter\r\nrain” will be given at its close, for the ripening of the harvest. “Then\r\nshall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord: His going forth is\r\nprepared as the morning; and He shall come unto us as the rain, as the\r\nlatter and former rain unto the earth.”(1048) “Be glad then, ye children\r\nof Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God: for He hath given you the\r\nformer rain moderately, and He will cause to come down for you the rain,\r\nthe former rain, and the latter rain.”(1049) “In the last days, saith God,\r\nI will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh.” “And it shall come to pass,\r\nthat whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”(1050)\r\n\r\nThe great work of the gospel is not to close with less manifestation of\r\nthe power of God than marked its opening. The prophecies which were\r\nfulfilled in the outpouring of the former rain at the opening of the\r\ngospel, are again to be fulfilled in the latter rain at its close. Here\r\nare “the times of refreshing” to which the apostle Peter looked forward\r\nwhen he said, “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may\r\nbe blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence\r\nof the Lord; and He shall send Jesus.”(1051)\r\n\r\nServants of God, with their faces lighted up and shining with holy\r\nconsecration, will hasten from place to place to proclaim the message from\r\nheaven. By thousands of voices, all over the earth, the warning will be\r\ngiven. Miracles will be wrought, the sick will be healed, and signs and\r\nwonders will follow the believers. Satan also works with lying wonders,\r\neven bringing down fire from heaven in the sight of men.(1052) Thus the\r\ninhabitants of the earth will be brought to take their stand.\r\n\r\nThe message will be carried not so much by argument as by the deep\r\nconviction of the Spirit of God. The arguments have been presented. The\r\nseed has been sown, and now it will spring up and bear fruit. The\r\npublications distributed by missionary workers have exerted their\r\ninfluence, yet many whose minds were impressed have been prevented from\r\nfully comprehending the truth or from yielding obedience. Now the rays of\r\nlight penetrate everywhere, the truth is seen in its clearness, and the\r\nhonest children of God sever the bands which have held them. Family\r\nconnections, church relations, are powerless to stay them now. Truth is\r\nmore precious than all besides. Notwithstanding the agencies combined\r\nagainst the truth, a large number take their stand upon the Lord’s side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n39. “THE TIME OF TROUBLE.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\n“At that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for\r\nthe children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as\r\nnever was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that\r\ntime thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written\r\nin the book.”(1053)\r\n\r\nWhen the third angel’s message closes, mercy no longer pleads for the\r\nguilty inhabitants of the earth. The people of God have accomplished their\r\nwork. They have received “the latter rain,” “the refreshing from the\r\npresence of the Lord,” and they are prepared for the trying hour before\r\nthem. Angels are hastening to and fro in heaven. An angel returning from\r\nthe earth announces that his work is done; the final test has been brought\r\nupon the world, and all who have proved themselves loyal to the divine\r\nprecepts have received “the seal of the living God.” Then Jesus ceases His\r\nintercession in the sanctuary above. He lifts His hands, and with a loud\r\nvoice says, “It is done;” and all the angelic host lay off their crowns as\r\nHe makes the solemn announcement: “He that is unjust, let him be unjust\r\nstill: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is\r\nrighteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be\r\nholy still.”(1054) Every case has been decided for life or death. Christ\r\nhas made the atonement for His people, and blotted out their sins. The\r\nnumber of His subjects is made up; “the kingdom and dominion, and the\r\ngreatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven,” is about to be given to\r\nthe heirs of salvation, and Jesus is to reign as King of kings, and Lord\r\nof lords.\r\n\r\nWhen He leaves the sanctuary, darkness covers the inhabitants of the\r\nearth. In that fearful time the righteous must live in the sight of a holy\r\nGod without an intercessor. The restraint which has been upon the wicked\r\nis removed, and Satan has entire control of the finally impenitent. God’s\r\nlong-suffering has ended. The world has rejected His mercy, despised His\r\nlove, and trampled upon His law. The wicked have passed the boundary of\r\ntheir probation; the Spirit of God, persistently resisted, has been at\r\nlast withdrawn. Unsheltered by divine grace, they have no protection from\r\nthe wicked one. Satan will then plunge the inhabitants of the earth into\r\none great, final trouble. As the angels of God cease to hold in check the\r\nfierce winds of human passion, all the elements of strife will be let\r\nloose. The whole world will be involved in ruin more terrible than that\r\nwhich came upon Jerusalem of old.\r\n\r\nA single angel destroyed all the first-born of the Egyptians, and filled\r\nthe land with mourning. When David offended against God by numbering the\r\npeople, one angel caused that terrible destruction by which his sin was\r\npunished. The same destructive power exercised by holy angels when God\r\ncommands, will be exercised by evil angels when He permits. There are\r\nforces now ready, and only waiting the divine permission, to spread\r\ndesolation everywhere.\r\n\r\nThose who honor the law of God have been accused of bringing judgments\r\nupon the world, and they will be regarded as the cause of the fearful\r\nconvulsions of nature and the strife and bloodshed among men that are\r\nfilling the earth with woe. The power attending the last warning has\r\nenraged the wicked; their anger is kindled against all who have received\r\nthe message, and Satan will excite to still greater intensity the spirit\r\nof hatred and persecution.\r\n\r\nWhen God’s presence was finally withdrawn from the Jewish nation, priests\r\nand people knew it not. Though under the control of Satan, and swayed by\r\nthe most horrible and malignant passions, they still regarded themselves\r\nas the chosen of God. The ministration in the temple continued; sacrifices\r\nwere offered upon its polluted altars, and daily the divine blessing was\r\ninvoked upon a people guilty of the blood of God’s dear Son, and seeking\r\nto slay His ministers and apostles. So when the irrevocable decision of\r\nthe sanctuary has been pronounced, and the destiny of the world has been\r\nforever fixed, the inhabitants of the earth will know it not. The forms of\r\nreligion will be continued by a people from whom the Spirit of God has\r\nbeen finally withdrawn; and the satanic zeal with which the prince of evil\r\nwill inspire them for the accomplishment of his malignant designs, will\r\nbear the semblance of zeal for God.\r\n\r\nAs the Sabbath has become the special point of controversy throughout\r\nChristendom, and religious and secular authorities have combined to\r\nenforce the observance of the Sunday, the persistent refusal of a small\r\nminority to yield to the popular demand, will make them objects of\r\nuniversal execration. It will be urged that the few who stand in\r\nopposition to an institution of the church and a law of the state, ought\r\nnot to be tolerated; that it is better for them to suffer than for whole\r\nnations to be thrown into confusion and lawlessness. The same argument\r\neighteen hundred years ago was brought against Christ by the “rulers of\r\nthe people.” “It is expedient for us,” said the wily Caiaphas, “that one\r\nman should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish\r\nnot.”(1055) This argument will appear conclusive; and a decree will\r\nfinally be issued against those who hallow the Sabbath of the fourth\r\ncommandment, denouncing them as deserving of the severest punishment, and\r\ngiving the people liberty, after a certain time, to put them to death.\r\nRomanism in the Old World, and apostate Protestantism in the New, will\r\npursue a similar course toward those who honor all the divine precepts.\r\n\r\nThe people of God will then be plunged into those scenes of affliction and\r\ndistress described by the prophet as the time of Jacob’s trouble. “Thus\r\nsaith the Lord: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of\r\npeace.... All faces are turned into paleness. Alas! for that day is great,\r\nso that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he\r\nshall be saved out of it.”(1056)\r\n\r\nJacob’s night of anguish, when he wrestled in prayer for deliverance from\r\nthe hand of Esau,(1057) represents the experience of God’s people in the\r\ntime of trouble. Because of the deception practised to secure his father’s\r\nblessing, intended for Esau, Jacob had fled for his life, alarmed by his\r\nbrother’s deadly threats. After remaining for many years an exile, he had\r\nset out, at God’s command, to return with his wives and children, his\r\nflocks and herds, to his native country. On reaching the borders of the\r\nland, he was filled with terror by the tidings of Esau’s approach at the\r\nhead of a band of warriors, doubtless bent upon revenge. Jacob’s company,\r\nunarmed and defenseless, seemed about to fall helpless victims of violence\r\nand slaughter. And to the burden of anxiety and fear was added the\r\ncrushing weight of self-reproach; for it was his own sin that had brought\r\nthis danger. His only hope was in the mercy of God; his only defense must\r\nbe prayer. Yet he leaves nothing undone on his own part to atone for the\r\nwrong to his brother, and to avert the threatened danger. So should the\r\nfollowers of Christ, as they approach the time of trouble, make every\r\nexertion to place themselves in a proper light before the people, to\r\ndisarm prejudice, and to avert the danger which threatens liberty of\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nHaving sent his family away, that they may not witness his distress, Jacob\r\nremains alone to intercede with God. He confesses his sin, and gratefully\r\nacknowledges the mercy of God toward him, while with deep humiliation he\r\npleads the covenant made with his fathers, and the promises to himself in\r\nthe night vision at Bethel and in the land of his exile. The crisis in his\r\nlife has come; everything is at stake. In the darkness and solitude he\r\ncontinues praying and humbling himself before God. Suddenly a hand is laid\r\nupon his shoulder. He thinks that an enemy is seeking his life, and with\r\nall the energy of despair he wrestles with his assailant. As the day\r\nbegins to break, the stranger puts forth his superhuman power: at his\r\ntouch the strong man seems paralyzed, and he falls, a helpless, weeping\r\nsuppliant, upon the neck of his mysterious antagonist. Jacob knows now\r\nthat it is the Angel of the Covenant with whom he has been in conflict.\r\nThough disabled, and suffering the keenest pain, he does not relinquish\r\nhis purpose. Long has he endured perplexity, remorse, and trouble for his\r\nsin; now he must have the assurance that it is pardoned. The divine\r\nvisitant seems about to depart; but Jacob clings to Him, pleading for a\r\nblessing. The Angel urges, “Let Me go; for the day breaketh;” but the\r\npatriarch exclaims, “I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me.” What\r\nconfidence, what firmness and perseverance, are here displayed! Had this\r\nbeen a boastful, presumptuous claim, Jacob would have been instantly\r\ndestroyed; but his was the assurance of one who confesses his weakness and\r\nunworthiness, yet trusts the mercy of a covenant-keeping God.\r\n\r\n“He had power over the Angel, and prevailed.”(1058) Through humiliation,\r\nrepentance, and self-surrender, this sinful, erring mortal prevailed with\r\nthe Majesty of heaven. He had fastened his trembling grasp upon the\r\npromises of God, and the heart of Infinite Love could not turn away the\r\nsinner’s plea. As an evidence of his triumph, and an encouragement to\r\nothers to imitate his example, his name was changed from one which was a\r\nreminder of his sin, to one that commemorated his victory. And the fact\r\nthat Jacob had prevailed with God was an assurance that he would prevail\r\nwith men. He no longer feared to encounter his brother’s anger; for the\r\nLord was his defense.\r\n\r\nSatan had accused Jacob before the angels of God, claiming the right to\r\ndestroy him because of his sin; he had moved upon Esau to march against\r\nhim; and during the patriarch’s long night of wrestling, Satan endeavored\r\nto force upon him a sense of his guilt, in order to discourage him, and\r\nbreak his hold upon God. Jacob was driven almost to despair; but he knew\r\nthat without help from heaven he must perish. He had sincerely repented of\r\nhis great sin, and he appealed to the mercy of God. He would not be turned\r\nfrom his purpose, but held fast the Angel, and urged his petition with\r\nearnest, agonizing cries, until he prevailed.\r\n\r\nAs Satan influenced Esau to march against Jacob, so he will stir up the\r\nwicked to destroy God’s people in the time of trouble. And as he accused\r\nJacob, he will urge his accusations against the people of God. He numbers\r\nthe world as his subjects; but the little company who keep the\r\ncommandments of God are resisting his supremacy. If he could blot them\r\nfrom the earth, his triumph would be complete. He sees that holy angels\r\nare guarding them, and he infers that their sins have been pardoned; but\r\nhe does not know that their cases have been decided in the sanctuary\r\nabove. He has an accurate knowledge of the sins which he has tempted them\r\nto commit, and he presents these before God in the most exaggerated light,\r\nrepresenting this people to be just as deserving as himself of exclusion\r\nfrom the favor of God. He declares that the Lord cannot in justice forgive\r\ntheir sins, and yet destroy him and his angels. He claims them as his\r\nprey, and demands that they be given into his hands to destroy.\r\n\r\nAs Satan accuses the people of God on account of their sins, the Lord\r\npermits him to try them to the uttermost. Their confidence in God, their\r\nfaith and firmness, will be severely tested. As they review the past,\r\ntheir hopes sink; for in their whole lives they can see little good. They\r\nare fully conscious of their weakness and unworthiness. Satan endeavors to\r\nterrify them with the thought that their cases are hopeless, that the\r\nstain of their defilement will never be washed away. He hopes so to\r\ndestroy their faith that they will yield to his temptations, and turn from\r\ntheir allegiance to God.\r\n\r\nThough God’s people will be surrounded by enemies who are bent upon their\r\ndestruction, yet the anguish which they suffer is not a dread of\r\npersecution for the truth’s sake; they fear that every sin has not been\r\nrepented of, and that through some fault in themselves they will fail to\r\nrealize the fulfilment of the Saviour’s promise, “I will keep thee from\r\nthe hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world.”(1059) If\r\nthey could have the assurance of pardon, they would not shrink from\r\ntorture or death; but should they prove unworthy, and lose their lives\r\nbecause of their own defects of character, then God’s holy name would be\r\nreproached.\r\n\r\nOn every hand they hear the plottings of treason, and see the active\r\nworking of rebellion; and there is aroused within them an intense desire,\r\nan earnest yearning of soul, that this great apostasy may be terminated,\r\nand the wickedness of the wicked may come to an end. But while they plead\r\nwith God to stay the work of rebellion, it is with a keen sense of\r\nself-reproach that they themselves have no more power to resist and urge\r\nback the mighty tide of evil. They feel that had they always employed all\r\ntheir ability in the service of Christ, going forward from strength to\r\nstrength, Satan’s forces would have less power to prevail against them.\r\n\r\nThey afflict their souls before God, pointing to their past repentance of\r\ntheir many sins, and pleading the Saviour’s promise, “Let him take hold of\r\nMy strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with\r\nMe.”(1060) Their faith does not fail because their prayers are not\r\nimmediately answered. Though suffering the keenest anxiety, terror, and\r\ndistress, they do not cease their intercessions. They lay hold of the\r\nstrength of God as Jacob laid hold of the Angel; and the language of their\r\nsouls is, “I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me.”\r\n\r\nHad not Jacob previously repented of his sin in obtaining the birthright\r\nby fraud, God would not have heard his prayer and mercifully preserved his\r\nlife. So, in the time of trouble, if the people of God had unconfessed\r\nsins to appear before them while tortured with fear and anguish, they\r\nwould be overwhelmed; despair would cut off their faith, and they could\r\nnot have confidence to plead with God for deliverance. But while they have\r\na deep sense of their unworthiness, they have no concealed wrongs to\r\nreveal. Their sins have gone beforehand to judgment, and have been blotted\r\nout; and they cannot bring them to remembrance.\r\n\r\nSatan leads many to believe that God will overlook their unfaithfulness in\r\nthe minor affairs of life; but the Lord shows in His dealings with Jacob\r\nthat He will in no wise sanction or tolerate evil. All who endeavor to\r\nexcuse or conceal their sins, and permit them to remain upon the books of\r\nheaven, unconfessed and unforgiven, will be overcome by Satan. The more\r\nexalted their profession, and the more honorable the position which they\r\nhold, the more grievous is their course in the sight of God, and the more\r\nsure the triumph of their great adversary. Those who delay a preparation\r\nfor the day of God cannot obtain it in the time of trouble, or at any\r\nsubsequent time. The case of all such is hopeless.\r\n\r\nThose professed Christians who come up to that last fearful conflict\r\nunprepared, will, in their despair, confess their sins in words of burning\r\nanguish, while the wicked exult over their distress. These confessions are\r\nof the same character as was that of Esau or of Judas. Those who make\r\nthem, lament the _result_ of transgression, but not its guilt. They feel\r\nno true contrition, no abhorrence of evil. They acknowledge their sin,\r\nthrough fear of punishment; but, like Pharaoh of old, they would return to\r\ntheir defiance of Heaven, should the judgments be removed.\r\n\r\nJacob’s history is also an assurance that God will not cast off those who\r\nhave been deceived, and tempted, and betrayed into sin, but who have\r\nreturned unto Him with true repentance. While Satan seeks to destroy this\r\nclass, God will send His angels to comfort and protect them in the time of\r\nperil. The assaults of Satan are fierce and determined, his delusions are\r\nterrible; but the Lord’s eye is upon His people, and His ear listens to\r\ntheir cries. Their affliction is great, the flames of the furnace seem\r\nabout to consume them; but the Refiner will bring them forth as gold tried\r\nin the fire. God’s love for His children during the period of their\r\nseverest trial, is as strong and tender as in the days of their sunniest\r\nprosperity; but it is needful for them to be placed in the furnace of\r\nfire; their earthliness must be consumed, that the image of Christ may be\r\nperfectly reflected.\r\n\r\nThe season of distress and anguish before us will require a faith that can\r\nendure weariness, delay, and hunger,—a faith that will not faint, though\r\nseverely tried. The period of probation is granted to all to prepare for\r\nthat time. Jacob prevailed because he was persevering and determined. His\r\nvictory is an evidence of the power of importunate prayer. All who will\r\nlay hold of God’s promises, as he did, and be as earnest and persevering\r\nas he was, will succeed as he succeeded. Those who are unwilling to deny\r\nself, to agonize before God, to pray long and earnestly for His blessing,\r\nwill not obtain it. Wrestling with God—how few know what it is! How few\r\nhave ever had their souls drawn out after God with intensity of desire\r\nuntil every power is on the stretch. When waves of despair which no\r\nlanguage can express sweep over the suppliant, how few cling with\r\nunyielding faith to the promises of God.\r\n\r\nThose who exercise but little faith now, are in the greatest danger of\r\nfalling under the power of satanic delusions and the decree to compel the\r\nconscience. And even if they endure the test, they will be plunged into\r\ndeeper distress and anguish in the time of trouble, because they have\r\nnever made it a habit to trust in God. The lessons of faith which they\r\nhave neglected, they will be forced to learn under a terrible pressure of\r\ndiscouragement.\r\n\r\nWe should now acquaint ourselves with God by proving His promises. Angels\r\nrecord every prayer that is earnest and sincere. We should rather dispense\r\nwith selfish gratifications than neglect communion with God. The deepest\r\npoverty, the greatest self-denial, with His approval, is better than\r\nriches, honors, ease, and friendship without it. We must take time to\r\npray. If we allow our minds to be absorbed by worldly interests, the Lord\r\nmay give us time by removing from us our idols of gold, of houses, or of\r\nfertile lands.\r\n\r\nThe young would not be seduced into sin if they would refuse to enter any\r\npath save that upon which they could ask God’s blessing. If the messengers\r\nwho bear the last solemn warning to the world would pray for the blessing\r\nof God, not in a cold, listless, lazy manner, but fervently and in faith,\r\nas did Jacob, they would find many places where they could say, “I have\r\nseen God face to face, and my life is preserved.”(1061) They would be\r\naccounted of heaven as princes, having power to prevail with God and with\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe “time of trouble such as never was,” is soon to open upon us; and we\r\nshall need an experience which we do not now possess, and which many are\r\ntoo indolent to obtain. It is often the case that trouble is greater in\r\nanticipation that in reality; but this is not true of the crisis before\r\nus. The most vivid presentation cannot reach the magnitude of the ordeal.\r\nIn that time of trial, every soul must stand for himself before God.\r\n“Though Noah, Daniel, and Job” were in the land, “as I live, saith the\r\nLord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but\r\ndeliver their own souls by their righteousness.”(1062)\r\n\r\nNow, while our great High Priest is making the atonement for us, we should\r\nseek to become perfect in Christ. Not even by a thought could our Saviour\r\nbe brought to yield to the power of temptation. Satan finds in human\r\nhearts some point where he can gain a foothold; some sinful desire is\r\ncherished, by means of which his temptations assert their power. But\r\nChrist declared of Himself, “The prince of this world cometh, and hath\r\nnothing in Me.”(1063) Satan could find nothing in the Son of God that\r\nwould enable him to gain the victory. He had kept His Father’s\r\ncommandments, and there was no sin in Him that Satan could use to his\r\nadvantage. This is the condition in which those must be found who shall\r\nstand in the time of trouble.\r\n\r\nIt is in this life that we are to separate sin from us, through faith in\r\nthe atoning blood of Christ. Our precious Saviour invites us to join\r\nourselves to Him, to unite our weakness to His strength, our ignorance to\r\nHis wisdom, our unworthiness to His merits. God’s providence is the school\r\nin which we are to learn the meekness and lowliness of Jesus. The Lord is\r\never setting before us, not the way we would choose, which seems easier\r\nand pleasanter to us, but the true aims of life. It rests with us to\r\nco-operate with the agencies which Heaven employs in the work of\r\nconforming our characters to the divine model. None can neglect or defer\r\nthis work but at the most fearful peril to their souls.\r\n\r\nThe apostle John in vision heard a loud voice in heaven exclaiming, “Woe\r\nto the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down\r\nunto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short\r\ntime.”(1064) Fearful are the scenes which call forth this exclamation from\r\nthe heavenly voice. The wrath of Satan increases as his time grows short,\r\nand his work of deceit and destruction will reach its culmination in the\r\ntime of trouble.\r\n\r\nFearful sights of a supernatural character will soon be revealed in the\r\nheavens, in token of the power of miracle-working demons. The spirits of\r\ndevils will go forth to the kings of the earth and to the whole world, to\r\nfasten them in deception, and urge them on to unite with Satan in his last\r\nstruggle against the government of heaven. By these agencies, rulers and\r\nsubjects will be alike deceived. Persons will arise pretending to be\r\nChrist Himself, and claiming the title and worship which belong to the\r\nworld’s Redeemer. They will perform wonderful miracles of healing, and\r\nwill profess to have revelations from heaven contradicting the testimony\r\nof the Scriptures.\r\n\r\nAs the crowning act in the great drama of deception, Satan himself will\r\npersonate Christ. The church has long professed to look to the Saviour’s\r\nadvent as the consummation of her hopes. Now the great deceiver will make\r\nit appear that Christ has come. In different parts of the earth, Satan\r\nwill manifest himself among men as a majestic being of dazzling\r\nbrightness, resembling the description of the Son of God given by John in\r\nthe Revelation.(1065) The glory that surrounds him is unsurpassed by\r\nanything that mortal eyes have yet beheld. The shout of triumph rings out\r\nupon the air, “Christ has come! Christ has come!” The people prostrate\r\nthemselves in adoration before him, while he lifts up his hands, and\r\npronounces a blessing upon them, as Christ blessed His disciples when He\r\nwas upon the earth. His voice is soft and subdued, yet full of melody. In\r\ngentle, compassionate tones he presents some of the same gracious,\r\nheavenly truths which the Saviour uttered; he heals the diseases of the\r\npeople, and then, in his assumed character of Christ, he claims to have\r\nchanged the Sabbath to Sunday, and commands all to hallow the day which he\r\nhas blessed. He declares that those who persist in keeping holy the\r\nseventh day are blaspheming his name by refusing to listen to his angels\r\nsent to them with light and truth. This is the strong, almost\r\novermastering delusion. Like the Samaritans who were deceived by Simon\r\nMagus, the multitudes, from the least to the greatest, give heed to these\r\nsorceries, saying, This is “the great power of God.”(1066)\r\n\r\nBut the people of God will not be misled. The teachings of this false\r\nchrist are not in accordance with the Scriptures. His blessing is\r\npronounced upon the worshipers of the beast and his image, the very class\r\nupon whom the Bible declares that God’s unmingled wrath shall be poured\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAnd, furthermore, Satan is not permitted to counterfeit the manner of\r\nChrist’s advent. The Saviour has warned His people against deception upon\r\nthis point, and has clearly foretold the manner of His second coming.\r\n“There shall arise false christs, and false prophets, and shall show great\r\nsigns and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive\r\nthe very elect.... Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, He is in\r\nthe desert; go not forth: behold, He is in the secret chambers; believe it\r\nnot. For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto\r\nthe west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.”(1067) This\r\ncoming, there is no possibility of counterfeiting. It will be universally\r\nknown—witnessed by the whole world.\r\n\r\nOnly those who have been diligent students of the Scriptures, and who have\r\nreceived the love of the truth, will be shielded from the powerful\r\ndelusion that takes the world captive. By the Bible testimony these will\r\ndetect the deceiver in his disguise. To all, the testing time will come.\r\nBy the sifting of temptation, the genuine Christian will be revealed. Are\r\nthe people of God now so firmly established upon His word that they would\r\nnot yield to the evidence of their senses? Would they, in such a crisis,\r\ncling to the Bible, and the Bible only? Satan will, if possible, prevent\r\nthem from obtaining a preparation to stand in that day. He will so arrange\r\naffairs as to hedge up their way, entangle them with earthly treasures,\r\ncause them to carry a heavy, wearisome burden, that their hearts may be\r\novercharged with the cares of this life, and the day of trial may come\r\nupon them as a thief.\r\n\r\nAs the decree issued by the various rulers of Christendom against\r\ncommandment-keepers shall withdraw the protection of government, and\r\nabandon them to those who desire their destruction, the people of God will\r\nflee from the cities and villages and associate together in companies,\r\ndwelling in the most desolate and solitary places. Many will find refuge\r\nin the strongholds of the mountains. Like the Christians of the Piedmont\r\nvalleys, they will make the high places of the earth their sanctuaries,\r\nand will thank God for the “munitions of rocks.”(1068) But many of all\r\nnations, and of all classes, high and low, rich and poor, black and white,\r\nwill be cast into the most unjust and cruel bondage. The beloved of God\r\npass weary days, bound in chains, shut in by prison bars, sentenced to be\r\nslain, some apparently left to die of starvation in dark and loathsome\r\ndungeons. No human ear is open to hear their moans; no human hand is ready\r\nto lend them help.\r\n\r\nWill the Lord forget His people in this trying hour? Did He forget\r\nfaithful Noah when judgments were visited upon the antediluvian world? Did\r\nHe forget Lot when the fire came down from heaven to consume the cities of\r\nthe plain? Did He forget Joseph surrounded by idolaters in Egypt? Did He\r\nforget Elijah when the oath of Jezebel threatened him with the fate of the\r\nprophets of Baal? Did He forget Jeremiah in the dark and dismal pit of his\r\nprison-house? Did He forget the three worthies in the fiery furnace? or\r\nDaniel in the den of lions?\r\n\r\n“Zion said, Jehovah hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me. Can a\r\nwoman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the\r\nson of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee. Behold,\r\nI have graven thee upon the palms of My hands.”(1069) The Lord of hosts\r\nhas said, “He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of His eye.”(1070)\r\n\r\nThough enemies may thrust them into prison, yet dungeon walls cannot cut\r\noff the communication between their souls and Christ. One who sees their\r\nevery weakness, who is acquainted with every trial, is above all earthly\r\npowers; and angels will come to them in lonely cells, bringing light and\r\npeace from heaven. The prison will be as a palace; for the rich in faith\r\ndwell there, and the gloomy walls will be lighted up with heavenly light,\r\nas when Paul and Silas prayed and sung praises at midnight in the\r\nPhilippian dungeon.\r\n\r\nGod’s judgments will be visited upon those who are seeking to oppress and\r\ndestroy His people. His long forbearance with the wicked emboldens men in\r\ntransgression, but their punishment is none the less certain and terrible\r\nbecause it is long delayed. “The Lord shall rise up as in Mount Perazim,\r\nHe shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that He may do His work, His\r\nstrange work; and bring to pass His act, His strange act.”(1071) To our\r\nmerciful God the act of punishment is a strange act. “As I live, saith the\r\nLord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked.”(1072) The Lord\r\nis “merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and\r\ntruth, ... forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin.” Yet He will “by\r\nno means clear the guilty.” “The Lord is slow to anger, and great in\r\npower, and will not at all acquit the wicked.”(1073) By terrible things in\r\nrighteousness He will vindicate the authority of His downtrodden law. The\r\nseverity of the retribution awaiting the transgressor may be judged by the\r\nLord’s reluctance to execute justice. The nation with which He bears long,\r\nand which He will not smite until it has filled up the measure of its\r\niniquity in God’s account, will finally drink the cup of wrath unmixed\r\nwith mercy.\r\n\r\nWhen Christ ceases His intercession in the sanctuary, the unmingled wrath\r\nthreatened against those who worship the beast and his image and receive\r\nhis mark,(1074) will be poured out. The plagues upon Egypt when God was\r\nabout to deliver Israel, were similar in character to those more terrible\r\nand extensive judgments which are to fall upon the world just before the\r\nfinal deliverance of God’s people. Says the revelator, in describing those\r\nterrific scourges: “There fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men\r\nwhich had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshiped his image.”\r\nThe sea “became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in\r\nthe sea.” And “the rivers and fountains of waters ... became blood.”\r\nTerrible as these inflictions are, God’s justice stands fully vindicated.\r\nThe angel of God declares: “Thou are righteous, O Lord, ... because Thou\r\nhast judged thus. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and\r\nThou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.”(1075) By\r\ncondemning the people of God to death, they have as truly incurred the\r\nguilt of their blood as if it had been shed by their hands. In like manner\r\nChrist declared the Jews of His time guilty of all the blood of holy men\r\nwhich had been shed since the days of Abel; for they possessed the same\r\nspirit, and were seeking to do the same work, with these murderers of the\r\nprophets.\r\n\r\nIn the plague that follows, power is given to the sun “to scorch men with\r\nfire. And men were scorched with great heat.”(1076) The prophets thus\r\ndescribe the condition of the earth at this fearful time: “The land\r\nmourneth; ... because the harvest of the field is perished.” “All the\r\ntrees of the field are withered: because joy is withered away from the\r\nsons of men.” “The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid\r\ndesolate.” “How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed,\r\nbecause they have no pasture.... The rivers of waters are dried up, and\r\nthe fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.” “The songs of the\r\ntemple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord God: there shall be\r\nmany dead bodies in every place; they shall cast them forth with\r\nsilence.”(1077)\r\n\r\nThese plagues are not universal, or the inhabitants of the earth would be\r\nwholly cut off. Yet they will be the most awful scourges that have ever\r\nbeen known to mortals. All the judgments upon men, prior to the close of\r\nprobation, have been mingled with mercy. The pleading blood of Christ has\r\nshielded the sinner from receiving the full measure of his guilt; but in\r\nthe final judgment, wrath is poured out unmixed with mercy.\r\n\r\nIn that day, multitudes will desire the shelter of God’s mercy which they\r\nhave so long despised. “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I\r\nwill send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for\r\nwater, but of hearing the words of the Lord: and they shall wander from\r\nsea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro\r\nto seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.”(1078)\r\n\r\nThe people of God will not be free from suffering; but while persecuted\r\nand distressed, while they endure privation, and suffer for want of food,\r\nthey will not be left to perish. That God who cared for Elijah, will not\r\npass by one of His self-sacrificing children. He who numbers the hairs of\r\ntheir head, will care for them; and in time of famine they shall be\r\nsatisfied. While the wicked are dying from hunger and pestilence, angels\r\nwill shield the righteous, and supply their wants. To him that “walketh\r\nrighteously” is the promise, “Bread shall be given him; his waters shall\r\nbe sure.” “When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and\r\ntheir tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of\r\nIsrael will not forsake them.”(1079)\r\n\r\n“Although the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the\r\nvines; the labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no\r\nmeat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd\r\nin the stalls:” yet shall they that fear Him “rejoice in the Lord,” and\r\njoy in the God of their salvation.(1080)\r\n\r\n“The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The\r\nsun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord shall\r\npreserve thee from all evil: He shall preserve thy soul.” “He shall\r\ndeliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome\r\npestilence. He shall cover thee with His feathers, and under His wings\r\nshalt thou trust: His truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt\r\nnot be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by\r\nday; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the\r\ndestruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side,\r\nand ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. Only\r\nwith thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.\r\nBecause thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High,\r\nthy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague\r\ncome nigh thy dwelling.”(1081)\r\n\r\nYet to human sight it will appear that the people of God must soon seal\r\ntheir testimony with their blood, as did the martyrs before them. They\r\nthemselves begin to fear that the Lord has left them to fall by the hand\r\nof their enemies. It is a time of fearful agony. Day and night they cry\r\nunto God for deliverance. The wicked exult, and the jeering cry is heard,\r\n“Where now is your faith? Why does not God deliver you out of our hands if\r\nyou are indeed His people?” But the waiting ones remember Jesus dying upon\r\nCalvary’s cross, and the chief priests and rulers shouting in mockery, “He\r\nsaved others; Himself He cannot save. If He be the King of Israel, let Him\r\nnow come down from the cross, and we will believe Him.”(1082) Like Jacob,\r\nall are wrestling with God. Their countenances express their internal\r\nstruggle. Paleness sits upon every face. Yet they cease not their earnest\r\nintercession.\r\n\r\nCould men see with heavenly vision, they would behold companies of angels\r\nthat excel in strength stationed about those who have kept the word of\r\nChrist’s patience. With sympathizing tenderness, angels have witnessed\r\ntheir distress, and have heard their prayers. They are waiting the word of\r\ntheir Commander to snatch them from their peril. But they must wait yet a\r\nlittle longer. The people of God must drink of the cup, and be baptized\r\nwith the baptism. The very delay, so painful to them, is the best answer\r\nto their petitions. As they endeavor to wait trustingly for the Lord to\r\nwork, they are led to exercise faith, hope, and patience, which have been\r\ntoo little exercised during their religious experience. Yet for the\r\nelect’s sake, the time of trouble will be shortened. “Shall not God avenge\r\nHis own elect, which cry day and night unto Him?... I tell you that He\r\nwill avenge them speedily.”(1083) The end will come more quickly than men\r\nexpect. The wheat will be gathered and bound in sheaves for the garner of\r\nGod; the tares will be bound as fagots for the fires of destruction.\r\n\r\nThe heavenly sentinels, faithful to their trust, continue their watch.\r\nThough a general decree has fixed the time when commandment-keepers may be\r\nput to death, their enemies will in some cases anticipate the decree, and\r\nbefore the time specified, will endeavor to take their lives. But none can\r\npass the mighty guardians stationed about every faithful soul. Some are\r\nassailed in their flight from the cities and villages; but the swords\r\nraised against them break and fall as powerless as a straw. Others are\r\ndefended by angels in the form of men of war.\r\n\r\nIn all ages, God has wrought through holy angels for the succor and\r\ndeliverance of His people. Celestial beings have taken an active part in\r\nthe affairs of men. They have appeared clothed in garments that shone as\r\nthe lightning; they have come as men, in the garb of wayfarers. Angels\r\nhave appeared in human form to men of God. They have rested, as if weary,\r\nunder the oaks at noon. They have accepted the hospitalities of human\r\nhomes. They have acted as guides to benighted travelers. They have, with\r\ntheir own hands, kindled the fires of the altar. They have opened prison\r\ndoors, and set free the servants of the Lord. Clothed with the panoply of\r\nheaven, they came to roll away the stone from the Saviour’s tomb.\r\n\r\nIn the form of men, angels are often in the assemblies of the righteous,\r\nand they visit the assemblies of the wicked, as they went to Sodom, to\r\nmake a record of their deeds, to determine whether they have passed the\r\nboundary of God’s forbearance. The Lord delights in mercy; and for the\r\nsake of a few who really serve Him, He restrains calamities, and prolongs\r\nthe tranquillity of multitudes. Little do sinners against God realize that\r\nthey are indebted for their own lives to the faithful few whom they\r\ndelight to ridicule and oppress.\r\n\r\nThough the rulers of this world know it not, yet often in their councils\r\nangels have been spokesmen. Human eyes have looked upon them; human ears\r\nhave listened to their appeals; human lips have opposed their suggestions\r\nand ridiculed their counsels; human hands have met them with insult and\r\nabuse. In the council hall and the court of justice, these heavenly\r\nmessengers have shown an intimate acquaintance with human history; they\r\nhave proved themselves better able to plead the cause of the oppressed\r\nthan were their ablest and most eloquent defenders. They have defeated\r\npurposes and arrested evils that would have greatly retarded the work of\r\nGod, and would have caused great suffering to His people. In the hour of\r\nperil and distress, “the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that\r\nfear Him, and delivereth them.”(1084)\r\n\r\nWith earnest longing, God’s people await the tokens of their coming King.\r\nAs the watchmen are accosted, “What of the night?” the answer is given\r\nunfalteringly, “ ‘The morning cometh, and also the night.’(1085) Light is\r\ngleaming upon the clouds above the mountain tops. Soon there will be a\r\nrevealing of His glory. The Sun of Righteousness is about to shine forth.\r\nThe morning and the night are both at hand,—the opening of endless day to\r\nthe righteous, the settling down of eternal night to the wicked.”\r\n\r\nAs the wrestling ones urge their petitions before God, the veil separating\r\nthem from the unseen seems almost withdrawn. The heavens glow with the\r\ndawning of eternal day, and like the melody of angel songs, the words fall\r\nupon the ear, “Stand fast to your allegiance. Help is coming.” Christ, the\r\nalmighty victor, holds out to His weary soldiers a crown of immortal\r\nglory; and His voice comes from the gates ajar: “Lo, I am with you. Be not\r\nafraid. I am acquainted with all your sorrows; I have borne your griefs.\r\nYou are not warring against untried enemies. I have fought the battle in\r\nyour behalf, and in My name you are more than conquerors.”\r\n\r\nThe precious Saviour will send help just when we need it. The way to\r\nheaven is consecrated by His footprints. Every thorn that wounds our feet\r\nhas wounded His. Every cross that we are called to bear, He has borne\r\nbefore us. The Lord permits conflicts, to prepare the soul for peace. The\r\ntime of trouble is a fearful ordeal for God’s people; but it is the time\r\nfor every true believer to look up, and by faith he may see the bow of\r\npromise encircling him.\r\n\r\n“The redeemed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing unto Zion;\r\nand everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness\r\nand joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away. I, even I, am He that\r\ncomforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of a man that\r\nshall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass; and\r\nforgettest the Lord thy Maker; ... and hast feared continually every day\r\nbecause of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and\r\nwhere is the fury of the oppressor? The captive exile hasteneth that he\r\nmay be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread\r\nshould fail. But I am the Lord thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves\r\nroared: the Lord of hosts is His name. And I have put My words in thy\r\nmouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of Mine hand.”(1086)\r\n\r\n“Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:\r\nThus saith thy Lord Jehovah, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of His\r\npeople, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even\r\nthe dregs of the cup of My fury; thou shalt no more drink it again: but I\r\nwill put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to\r\nthy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as\r\nthe ground, and as the street, to them that went over.”(1087)\r\n\r\nThe eye of God, looking down the ages, was fixed upon the crisis which His\r\npeople are to meet, when earthly powers shall be arrayed against them.\r\nLike the captive exile, they will be in fear of death by starvation or by\r\nviolence. But the Holy One who divided the Red Sea before Israel, will\r\nmanifest His mighty power and turn their captivity. “They shall be Mine,\r\nsaith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up My jewels; and I will\r\nspare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.”(1088) If the\r\nblood of Christ’s faithful witnesses were shed at this time, it would not,\r\nlike the blood of the martyrs, be as seed sown to yield a harvest for God.\r\nTheir fidelity would not be a testimony to convince others of the truth;\r\nfor the obdurate heart has beaten back the waves of mercy until they\r\nreturn no more. If the righteous were now left to fall a prey to their\r\nenemies, it would be a triumph for the prince of darkness. Says the\r\npsalmist, “In the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion: in the\r\nsecret of His tabernacle shall He hide me.”(1089) Christ has spoken:\r\n“Come, My people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about\r\nthee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation\r\nbe overpast. For, behold, the Lord cometh out of His place to punish the\r\ninhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.”(1090) Glorious will be the\r\ndeliverance of those who have patiently waited for His coming, and whose\r\nnames are written in the book of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n40. GOD’S PEOPLE DELIVERED.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nWhen the protection of human laws shall be withdrawn from those who honor\r\nthe law of God, there will be, in different lands, a simultaneous movement\r\nfor their destruction. As the time appointed in the decree draws near, the\r\npeople will conspire to root out the hated sect. It will be determined to\r\nstrike in one night a decisive blow, which shall utterly silence the voice\r\nof dissent and reproof.\r\n\r\nThe people of God—some in prison cells, some hidden in solitary retreats\r\nin the forests and the mountains—still plead for divine protection, while\r\nin every quarter companies of armed men, urged on by hosts of evil angels,\r\nare preparing for the work of death. It is now, in the hour of utmost\r\nextremity, that the God of Israel will interpose for the deliverance of\r\nHis chosen. Saith the Lord: “Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a\r\nholy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth ... to\r\ncome into the mountain of Jehovah, to the Mighty One of Israel. And the\r\nLord shall cause His glorious voice to be heard, and shall show the\r\nlighting down of His arm, with the indignation of His anger, and with the\r\nflame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and\r\nhailstones.”(1091)\r\n\r\nWith shouts of triumph, jeering, and imprecation, throngs of evil men are\r\nabout to rush upon their prey, when, lo, a dense blackness, deeper than\r\nthe darkness of the night, falls upon the earth. Then a rainbow, shining\r\nwith the glory from the throne of God, spans the heavens, and seems to\r\nencircle each praying company. The angry multitudes are suddenly arrested.\r\nTheir mocking cries die away. The objects of their murderous rage are\r\nforgotten. With fearful forebodings they gaze upon the symbol of God’s\r\ncovenant, and long to be shielded from its overpowering brightness.\r\n\r\nBy the people of God a voice, clear and melodious, is heard, saying, “Look\r\nup,” and lifting their eyes to the heavens, they behold the bow of\r\npromise. The black, angry clouds that covered the firmament are parted,\r\nand like Stephen they look up steadfastly into heaven, and see the glory\r\nof God, and the Son of man seated upon His throne. In His divine form they\r\ndiscern the marks of His humiliation; and from His lips they hear the\r\nrequest, presented before His Father and the holy angels, “I will that\r\nthey also, whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am.”(1092) Again a\r\nvoice, musical and triumphant, is heard, saying: “They come! they come!\r\nholy, harmless, and undefiled. They have kept the word of My patience;\r\nthey shall walk among the angels;” and the pale, quivering lips of those\r\nwho have held fast their faith, utter a shout of victory.\r\n\r\nIt is at midnight that God manifests His power for the deliverance of His\r\npeople. The sun appears, shining in its strength. Signs and wonders follow\r\nin quick succession. The wicked look with terror and amazement upon the\r\nscene, while the righteous behold with solemn joy the tokens of their\r\ndeliverance. Everything in nature seems turned out of its course. The\r\nstreams cease to flow. Dark, heavy clouds come up, and clash against each\r\nother. In the midst of the angry heavens is one clear space of\r\nindescribable glory, whence comes the voice of God like the sound of many\r\nwaters, saying, “It is done.”(1093)\r\n\r\nThat voice shakes the heavens and the earth. There is a mighty earthquake,\r\n“such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake,\r\nand so great.”(1094) The firmament appears to open and shut. The glory\r\nfrom the throne of God seems flashing through. The mountains shake like a\r\nreed in the wind, and ragged rocks are scattered on every side. There is a\r\nroar as of a coming tempest. The sea is lashed into fury. There is heard\r\nthe shriek of the hurricane, like the voice of demons upon a mission of\r\ndestruction. The whole earth heaves and swells like the waves of the sea.\r\nIts surface is breaking up. Its very foundations seem to be giving way.\r\nMountain chains are sinking. Inhabited islands disappear. The seaports\r\nthat have become like Sodom for wickedness, are swallowed up by the angry\r\nwaters. Babylon the Great has come in remembrance before God, “to give\r\nunto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of His wrath.”(1095) Great\r\nhailstones, every one “about the weight of a talent,” are doing their work\r\nof destruction. The proudest cities of the earth are laid low. The lordly\r\npalaces, upon which the world’s great men have lavished their wealth in\r\norder to glorify themselves, are crumbling to ruin before their eyes.\r\nPrison walls are rent asunder, and God’s people, who have been held in\r\nbondage for their faith, are set free.\r\n\r\nGraves are opened, and “many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth\r\n... awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting\r\ncontempt.”(1096) All who have died in the faith of the third angel’s\r\nmessage come forth from the tomb glorified, to hear God’s covenant of\r\npeace with those who have kept His law. “They also which pierced\r\nHim,”(1097) those that mocked and derided Christ’s dying agonies, and the\r\nmost violent opposers of His truth and His people, are raised to behold\r\nHim in His glory, and to see the honor placed upon the loyal and obedient.\r\n\r\nThick clouds still cover the sky; yet the sun now and then breaks through,\r\nappearing like the avenging eye of Jehovah. Fierce lightnings leap from\r\nthe heavens, enveloping the earth in a sheet of flame. Above the terrific\r\nroar of thunder, voices, mysterious and awful, declare the doom of the\r\nwicked. The words spoken are not comprehended by all; but they are\r\ndistinctly understood by the false teachers. Those who a little before\r\nwere so reckless, so boastful and defiant, so exultant in their cruelty to\r\nGod’s commandment-keeping people, are now overwhelmed with consternation,\r\nand shuddering in fear. Their wails are heard above the sound of the\r\nelements. Demons acknowledge the deity of Christ, and tremble before His\r\npower, while men are supplicating for mercy, and groveling in abject\r\nterror.\r\n\r\nSaid the prophets of old, as they beheld in holy vision the day of God:\r\n“Howl ye; for the day of the Lord is at hand; it shall come as a\r\ndestruction from the Almighty.”(1098) “Enter into the rock, and hide thee\r\nin the dust, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of His majesty. The\r\nlofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be\r\nbowed down, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. For the day\r\nof the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and\r\nupon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low.” “In that\r\nday a man shall cast the idols of his silver, and the idols of his gold,\r\nwhich they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the\r\nbats; to go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged\r\nrocks, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of His majesty, when He\r\nariseth to shake terribly the earth.”(1099)\r\n\r\nThrough a rift in the clouds, there beams a star whose brilliancy is\r\nincreased fourfold in contrast with the darkness. It speaks hope and joy\r\nto the faithful, but severity and wrath to the transgressors of God’s law.\r\nThose who have sacrificed all for Christ are now secure, hidden as in the\r\nsecret of the Lord’s pavilion. They have been tested, and before the world\r\nand the despisers of truth they have evinced their fidelity to Him who\r\ndied for them. A marvelous change has come over those who have held fast\r\ntheir integrity in the very face of death. They have been suddenly\r\ndelivered from the dark and terrible tyranny of men transformed to demons.\r\nTheir faces, so lately pale, anxious, and haggard, are now aglow with\r\nwonder, faith, and love. Their voices rise in triumphant song: “God is our\r\nrefuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we\r\nfear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried\r\ninto the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar and be troubled,\r\nthough the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.”(1100)\r\n\r\nWhile these words of holy trust ascend to God, the clouds sweep back, and\r\nthe starry heavens are seen, unspeakably glorious in contrast with the\r\nblack and angry firmament on either side. The glory of the celestial city\r\nstreams from the gates ajar. Then there appears against the sky a hand\r\nholding two tables of stone folded together. Says the prophet, “The\r\nheavens shall declare His righteousness: for God is judge Himself.”(1101)\r\nThat holy law, God’s righteousness, that amid thunder and flame was\r\nproclaimed from Sinai as the guide of life, is now revealed to men as the\r\nrule of judgment. The hand opens the tables, and there are seen the\r\nprecepts of the decalogue, traced as with a pen of fire. The words are so\r\nplain that all can read them. Memory is aroused, the darkness of\r\nsuperstition and heresy is swept from every mind, and God’s ten words,\r\nbrief, comprehensive, and authoritative, are presented to the view of all\r\nthe inhabitants of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe the horror and despair of those who have\r\ntrampled upon God’s holy requirements. The Lord gave them His law; they\r\nmight have compared their characters with it, and learned their defects\r\nwhile there was yet opportunity for repentance and reform; but in order to\r\nsecure the favor of the world, they set aside its precepts and taught\r\nothers to transgress. They have endeavored to compel God’s people to\r\nprofane His Sabbath. Now they are condemned by that law which they have\r\ndespised. With awful distinctness they see that they are without excuse.\r\nThey chose whom they would serve and worship. “Then shall ye return, and\r\ndiscern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God\r\nand him that serveth Him not.”(1102)\r\n\r\nThe enemies of God’s law, from the ministers down to the least among them,\r\nhave a new conception of truth and duty. Too late they see that the\r\nSabbath of the fourth commandment is the seal of the living God. Too late\r\nthey see the true nature of their spurious sabbath, and the sandy\r\nfoundation upon which they have been building. They find that they have\r\nbeen fighting against God. Religious teachers have led souls to perdition\r\nwhile professing to guide them to the gates of Paradise. Not until the day\r\nof final accounts will it be known how great is the responsibility of men\r\nin holy office, and how terrible are the results of their unfaithfulness.\r\nOnly in eternity can we rightly estimate the loss of a single soul.\r\nFearful will be the doom of him to whom God shall say, Depart, thou wicked\r\nservant.\r\n\r\nThe voice of God is heard from heaven, declaring the day and hour of\r\nJesus’ coming, and delivering the everlasting covenant to His people. Like\r\npeals of loudest thunder, His words roll through the earth. The Israel of\r\nGod stand listening, with their eyes fixed upward. Their countenances are\r\nlighted up with His glory, and shine as did the face of Moses when he came\r\ndown from Sinai. The wicked cannot look upon them. And when the blessing\r\nis pronounced on those who have honored God by keeping His Sabbath holy,\r\nthere is a mighty shout of victory.\r\n\r\nSoon there appears in the east a small black cloud, about half the size of\r\na man’s hand. It is the cloud which surrounds the Saviour, and which seems\r\nin the distance to be shrouded in darkness. The people of God know this to\r\nbe the sign of the Son of man. In solemn silence they gaze upon it as it\r\ndraws nearer the earth, becoming lighter and more glorious, until it is a\r\ngreat white cloud, its base a glory like consuming fire, and above it the\r\nrainbow of the covenant. Jesus rides forth as a mighty conqueror. Not now\r\na “man of sorrows,” to drink the bitter cup of shame and woe, He comes,\r\nvictor in heaven and earth, to judge the living and the dead. “Faithful\r\nand true,” “in righteousness He doth judge and make war.” And “the armies\r\nwhich were in heaven follow Him.”(1103) With anthems of celestial melody\r\nthe holy angels, a vast, unnumbered throng, attend Him on His way. The\r\nfirmament seems filled with radiant forms,—“ten thousand times ten\r\nthousand, and thousands of thousands.” No human pen can portray the scene;\r\nno mortal mind is adequate to conceive its splendor. “His glory covered\r\nthe heavens, and the earth was full of His praise. And His brightness was\r\nas the light.”(1104) As the living cloud comes still nearer, every eye\r\nbeholds the Prince of life. No crown of thorns now mars that sacred head,\r\nbut a diadem of glory rests on His holy brow. His countenance outshines\r\nthe dazzling brightness of the noonday sun. “And He hath on His vesture\r\nand on His thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.”(1105)\r\n\r\nBefore His presence, “all faces are turned into paleness;” upon the\r\nrejecters of God’s mercy falls the terror of eternal despair. “The heart\r\nmelteth, and the knees smite together,” “and the faces of them all gather\r\nblackness.”(1106) The righteous cry with trembling, “Who shall be able to\r\nstand?” The angels’ song is hushed, and there is a period of awful\r\nsilence. Then the voice of Jesus is heard, saying, “My grace is sufficient\r\nfor you.” The faces of the righteous are lighted up, and joy fills every\r\nheart. And the angels strike a note higher, and sing again, as they draw\r\nstill nearer to the earth.\r\n\r\nThe King of kings descends upon the cloud, wrapped in flaming fire. The\r\nheavens are rolled together as a scroll, the earth trembles before Him,\r\nand every mountain and island is moved out of its place. “Our God shall\r\ncome, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before Him, and it\r\nshall be very tempestuous round about Him. He shall call to the heavens\r\nfrom above, and to the earth, that He may judge His people.”(1107)\r\n\r\n“And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the\r\nchief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every freeman,\r\nhid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; and said to\r\nthe mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that\r\nsitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the great day\r\nof His wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?”(1108)\r\n\r\nThe derisive jests have ceased. Lying lips are hushed into silence. The\r\nclash of arms, the tumult of battle, “with confused noise, and garments\r\nrolled in blood,”(1109) is stilled. Naught now is heard but the voice of\r\nprayer and the sound of weeping and lamentation. The cry bursts forth from\r\nlips so lately scoffing, “The great day of His wrath is come; and who\r\nshall be able to stand?” The wicked pray to be buried beneath the rocks of\r\nthe mountains, rather than meet the face of Him whom they have despised\r\nand rejected.\r\n\r\nThat voice which penetrates the ear of the dead, they know. How often have\r\nits plaintive, tender tones called them to repentance. How often has it\r\nbeen heard in the touching entreaties of a friend, a brother, a Redeemer.\r\nTo the rejecters of His grace, no other could be so full of condemnation,\r\nso burdened with denunciation, as that voice which has so long pleaded,\r\n“Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die?”(1110) O that\r\nit were to them the voice of a stranger! Says Jesus: “I have called, and\r\nye refused; I have stretched out My hand, and no man regarded; but ye have\r\nset at naught all My counsel, and would none of My reproof.”(1111) That\r\nvoice awakens memories which they would fain blot out,—warnings despised,\r\ninvitations refused, privileges slighted.\r\n\r\nThere are those who mocked Christ in His humiliation. With thrilling power\r\ncome to their minds the Sufferer’s words, when, adjured by the high\r\npriest, He solemnly declared, “Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man\r\nsitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of\r\nheaven.”(1112) Now they behold Him in His glory, and they are yet to see\r\nHim sitting on the right hand of power.\r\n\r\nThose who derided His claim to be the Son of God are speechless now. There\r\nis the haughty Herod who jeered at His royal title, and bade the mocking\r\nsoldiers crown Him king. There are the very men who with impious hands\r\nplaced upon His form the purple robe, upon His sacred brow the thorny\r\ncrown, and in His unresisting hand the mimic scepter, and bowed before Him\r\nin blasphemous mockery. The men who smote and spit upon the Prince of\r\nlife, now turn from His piercing gaze, and seek to flee from the\r\noverpowering glory of His presence. Those who drove the nails through His\r\nhands and feet, the soldier who pierced His side, behold these marks with\r\nterror and remorse.\r\n\r\nWith awful distinctness do priests and rulers recall the events of\r\nCalvary. With shuddering horror they remember how, wagging their heads in\r\nsatanic exultation, they exclaimed: “He saved others; Himself He cannot\r\nsave. If He be the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross,\r\nand we will believe Him. He trusted in God; let Him deliver Him now, if He\r\nwill have Him.”(1113)\r\n\r\nVividly they recall the Saviour’s parable of the husbandmen who refused to\r\nrender to their lord the fruit of the vineyard, who abused his servants\r\nand slew his son. They remember, too, the sentence which they themselves\r\npronounced: The lord of the vineyard “will miserably destroy those wicked\r\nmen.” In the sin and punishment of those unfaithful men, the priests and\r\nelders see their own course and their own just doom. And now there rises a\r\ncry of mortal agony. Louder than the shout, “Crucify Him! crucify Him!”\r\nwhich rang through the streets of Jerusalem, swells the awful, despairing\r\nwail, “He is the Son of God! He is the true Messiah!” They seek to flee\r\nfrom the presence of the King of kings. In the deep caverns of the earth,\r\nrent asunder by the warring of the elements, they vainly attempt to hide.\r\n\r\nIn the lives of all who reject truth, there are moments when conscience\r\nawakens, when memory presents the torturing recollection of a life of\r\nhypocrisy, and the soul is harassed with vain regrets. But what are these\r\ncompared with the remorse of that day when “fear cometh as desolation,”\r\nwhen “destruction cometh as a whirlwind”!(1114) Those who would have\r\ndestroyed Christ and His faithful people, now witness the glory which\r\nrests upon them. In the midst of their terror they hear the voices of the\r\nsaints in joyful strains exclaiming, “Lo, this is our God; we have waited\r\nfor Him, and He will save us.”(1115)\r\n\r\nAmid the reeling of the earth, the flash of lightning, and the roar of\r\nthunder, the voice of the Son of God calls forth the sleeping saints. He\r\nlooks upon the graves of the righteous, then raising His hands to heaven\r\nHe cries, “Awake, awake, awake, ye that sleep in the dust, and arise!”\r\nThroughout the length and breadth of the earth, the dead shall hear that\r\nvoice; and they that hear shall live. And the whole earth shall ring with\r\nthe tread of the exceeding great army of every nation, kindred, tongue,\r\nand people. From the prison-house of death they come, clothed with\r\nimmortal glory, crying, “O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is\r\nthy victory?”(1116) And the living righteous and the risen saints unite\r\ntheir voices in a long, glad shout of victory.\r\n\r\nAll come forth from their graves the same in stature as when they entered\r\nthe tomb. Adam, who stands among the risen throng, is of lofty height and\r\nmajestic form, in stature but little below the Son of God. He presents a\r\nmarked contrast to the people of later generations; in this one respect is\r\nshown the great degeneracy of the race. But all arise with the freshness\r\nand vigor of eternal youth. In the beginning, man was created in the\r\nlikeness of God, not only in character, but in form and feature. Sin\r\ndefaced and almost obliterated the divine image; but Christ came to\r\nrestore that which had been lost. He will change our vile bodies, and\r\nfashion them like unto His glorious body. The mortal, corruptible form,\r\ndevoid of comeliness, once polluted with sin, becomes perfect, beautiful,\r\nand immortal. All blemishes and deformities are left in the grave.\r\nRestored to the tree of life in the long-lost Eden, the redeemed will\r\n“grow up”(1117) to the full stature of the race in its primeval glory. The\r\nlast lingering traces of the curse of sin will be removed, and Christ’s\r\nfaithful ones will appear “in the beauty of the Lord our God,” in mind and\r\nsoul and body reflecting the perfect image of their Lord. Oh, wonderful\r\nredemption! long talked of, long hoped for, contemplated with eager\r\nanticipation, but never fully understood.\r\n\r\nThe living righteous are changed “in a moment, in the twinkling of an\r\neye.” At the voice of God they were glorified; now they are made immortal,\r\nand with the risen saints are caught up to meet their Lord in the air.\r\nAngels “gather together the elect from the four winds, from one end of\r\nheaven to the other.” Little children are borne by holy angels to their\r\nmothers’ arms. Friends long separated by death are united, nevermore to\r\npart, and with songs of gladness ascend together to the city of God.\r\n\r\nOn each side of the cloudy chariot are wings, and beneath it are living\r\nwheels; and as the chariot rolls upward, the wheels cry, “Holy,” and the\r\nwings, as they move, cry, “Holy,” and the retinue of angels cry, “Holy,\r\nholy, holy, Lord God Almighty.” And the redeemed shout “Alleluia!” as the\r\nchariot moves onward toward the New Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nBefore entering the city of God, the Saviour bestows upon His followers\r\nthe emblems of victory, and invests them with the insignia of their royal\r\nstate. The glittering ranks are drawn up, in the form of a hollow square,\r\nabout their King, whose form rises in majesty high above saint and angel,\r\nwhose countenance beams upon them full of benignant love. Throughout the\r\nunnumbered host of the redeemed, every glance is fixed upon Him, every eye\r\nbeholds His glory whose “visage was so marred more than any man, and His\r\nform more than the sons of men.” Upon the heads of the overcomers, Jesus\r\nwith His own right hand places the crown of glory. For each there is a\r\ncrown, bearing his own “new name,”(1118) and the inscription, “Holiness to\r\nthe Lord.” In every hand are placed the victor’s palm and the shining\r\nharp. Then, as the commanding angels strike the note, every hand sweeps\r\nthe harp strings with skilful touch, awaking sweet music in rich,\r\nmelodious strains. Rapture unutterable thrills every heart, and each voice\r\nis raised in grateful praise: “Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from\r\nour sins in His own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and\r\nHis Father; to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever.”(1119)\r\n\r\nBefore the ransomed throng is the holy city. Jesus opens wide the pearly\r\ngates, and the nations that have kept the truth enter in. There they\r\nbehold the Paradise of God, the home of Adam in his innocency. Then that\r\nvoice, richer than any music that ever fell on mortal ear, is heard,\r\nsaying, “Your conflict is ended.” “Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit\r\nthe kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.”\r\n\r\nNow is fulfilled the Saviour’s prayer for His disciples, “I will that they\r\nalso whom Thou hast given Me be with Me where I am.” “Faultless before the\r\npresence of His glory with exceeding joy,”(1120) Christ presents to the\r\nFather the purchase of His blood, declaring, “Here am I, and the children\r\nwhom Thou hast given Me.” “Those that Thou gavest Me I have kept.” Oh, the\r\nwonders of redeeming love! the rapture of that hour when the infinite\r\nFather, looking upon the ransomed, shall behold His image, sin’s discord\r\nbanished, its blight removed, and the human once more in harmony with the\r\ndivine!\r\n\r\nWith unutterable love, Jesus welcomes His faithful ones to the “joy of\r\ntheir Lord.” The Saviour’s joy is in seeing, in the kingdom of glory, the\r\nsouls that have been saved by His agony and humiliation. And the redeemed\r\nwill be sharers in His joy, as they behold, among the blessed, those who\r\nhave been won to Christ through their prayers, their labors, and their\r\nloving sacrifice. As they gather about the great white throne, gladness\r\nunspeakable will fill their hearts, when they behold those whom they have\r\nwon for Christ, and see that one has gained others, and these still\r\nothers, all brought into the haven of rest, there to lay their crowns at\r\nJesus’ feet, and praise Him through the endless cycles of eternity.\r\n\r\nAs the ransomed ones are welcomed to the city of God, there rings out upon\r\nthe air an exultant cry of adoration. The two Adams are about to meet. The\r\nSon of God is standing with outstretched arms to receive the father of our\r\nrace,—the being whom He created, who sinned against his Maker, and for\r\nwhose sin the marks of the crucifixion are borne upon the Saviour’s form.\r\nAs Adam discerns the prints of the cruel nails, he does not fall upon the\r\nbosom of his Lord, but in humiliation casts himself at His feet, crying,\r\n“Worthy, worthy is the Lamb that was slain!” Tenderly the Saviour lifts\r\nhim up, and bids him look once more upon the Eden home from which he has\r\nso long been exiled.\r\n\r\nAfter his expulsion from Eden, Adam’s life on earth was filled with\r\nsorrow. Every dying leaf, every victim of sacrifice, every blight upon the\r\nfair face of nature, every stain upon man’s purity, was a fresh reminder\r\nof his sin. Terrible was the agony of remorse as he beheld iniquity\r\nabounding, and, in answer to his warnings, met the reproaches cast upon\r\nhimself as the cause of sin. With patient humility he bore, for nearly a\r\nthousand years, the penalty of transgression. Faithfully did he repent of\r\nhis sin, and trust in the merits of the promised Saviour, and he died in\r\nthe hope of a resurrection. The Son of God redeemed man’s failure and\r\nfall; and now, through the work of the atonement, Adam is re-instated in\r\nhis first dominion.\r\n\r\nTransported with joy, he beholds the trees that were once his delight,—the\r\nvery trees whose fruit he himself had gathered in the days of his\r\ninnocence and joy. He sees the vines that his own hands have trained, the\r\nvery flowers that he once loved to care for. His mind grasps the reality\r\nof the scene; he comprehends that this is indeed Eden restored, more\r\nlovely now than when he was banished from it. The Saviour leads him to the\r\ntree of life, and plucks the glorious fruit, and bids him eat. He looks\r\nabout him, and beholds a multitude of his family redeemed, standing in the\r\nParadise of God. Then he casts his glittering crown at the feet of Jesus,\r\nand falling upon His breast, embraces the Redeemer. He touches the golden\r\nharp, and the vaults of heaven echo the triumphant song, “Worthy, worthy,\r\nworthy is the Lamb that was slain, and lives again!” The family of Adam\r\ntake up the strain, and cast their crowns at the Saviour’s feet as they\r\nbow before Him in adoration.\r\n\r\nThis reunion is witnessed by the angels who wept at the fall of Adam, and\r\nrejoiced when Jesus, after His resurrection, ascended to heaven, having\r\nopened the grave for all who should believe on His name. Now they behold\r\nthe work of redemption accomplished, and they unite their voices in the\r\nsong of praise.\r\n\r\nUpon the crystal sea before the throne, that sea of glass as it were\r\nmingled with fire,—so resplendent is it with the glory of God,—are\r\ngathered the company that have “gotten the victory over the beast, and\r\nover his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name.”(1121)\r\nWith the Lamb upon Mount Zion, “having the harps of God,” they stand, the\r\nhundred and forty and four thousand that were redeemed from among men; and\r\nthere is heard, as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of a great\r\nthunder, “the voice of harpers harping with their harps.”(1122) And they\r\nsing “a new song” before the throne, a song which no man can learn save\r\nthe hundred and forty and four thousand. It is the song of Moses and the\r\nLamb,—a song of deliverance. None but the hundred and forty-four thousand\r\ncan learn that song; for it is the song of their experience,—an experience\r\nsuch as no other company have ever had. “These are they which follow the\r\nLamb whithersoever He goeth.” These, having been translated from the\r\nearth, from among the living, are counted as “the first-fruits unto God\r\nand to the Lamb.”(1123) “These are they which came out of great\r\ntribulation;”(1124) they have passed through the time of trouble such as\r\nnever was since there was a nation; they have endured the anguish of the\r\ntime of Jacob’s trouble; they have stood without an intercessor through\r\nthe final outpouring of God’s judgments. But they have been delivered, for\r\nthey have “washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the\r\nLamb.” “In their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault”\r\nbefore God. “Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve Him\r\nday and night in His temple: and He that sitteth on the throne shall dwell\r\namong them.”(1125) They have seen the earth wasted with famine and\r\npestilence, the sun having power to scorch men with great heat, and they\r\nthemselves have endured suffering, hunger, and thirst. But “they shall\r\nhunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on\r\nthem, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall\r\nfeed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God\r\nshall wipe away all tears from their eyes.”(1126)\r\n\r\nIn all ages the Saviour’s chosen have been educated and disciplined in the\r\nschool of trial. They walked in narrow paths on earth; they were purified\r\nin the furnace of affliction. For Jesus’ sake they endured opposition,\r\nhatred, calumny. They followed Him through conflicts sore; they endured\r\nself-denial and experienced bitter disappointments. By their own painful\r\nexperience they learned the evil of sin, its power, its guilt, its woe;\r\nand they look upon it with abhorrence. A sense of the infinite sacrifice\r\nmade for its cure, humbles them in their own sight, and fills their hearts\r\nwith gratitude and praise which those who have never fallen cannot\r\nappreciate. They love much, because they have been forgiven much. Having\r\nbeen partakers of Christ’s sufferings, they are fitted to be partakers\r\nwith Him of His glory.\r\n\r\nThe heirs of God have come from garrets, from hovels, from dungeons, from\r\nscaffolds, from mountains, from deserts, from the caves of the earth, from\r\nthe caverns of the sea. On earth they were “destitute, afflicted,\r\ntormented.” Millions went down to the grave loaded with infamy, because\r\nthey steadfastly refused to yield to the deceptive claims of Satan. By\r\nhuman tribunals they were adjudged the vilest of criminals. But now “God\r\nis judge Himself.”(1127) Now the decisions of earth are reversed. “The\r\nrebuke of His people shall He take away.”(1128) “They shall call them, The\r\nholy people, The redeemed of the Lord.” He hath appointed “to give unto\r\nthem beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise\r\nfor the spirit of heaviness.”(1129) They are no longer feeble, afflicted,\r\nscattered, and oppressed. Henceforth they are to be ever with the Lord.\r\nThey stand before the throne clad in richer robes than the most honored of\r\nthe earth have ever worn. They are crowned with diadems more glorious than\r\nwere ever placed upon the brow of earthly monarchs. The days of pain and\r\nweeping are forever ended. The King of glory has wiped the tears from all\r\nfaces; every cause of grief has been removed. Amid the waving of\r\npalm-branches they pour forth a song of praise, clear, sweet, and\r\nharmonious; every voice takes up the strain, until the anthem swells\r\nthrough the vaults of heaven, “Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the\r\nthrone, and unto the Lamb.” And all the inhabitants of heaven respond in\r\nthe ascription, “Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving,\r\nand honor, and power, and might, be unto our God forever and ever.”(1130)\r\n\r\nIn this life we can only begin to understand the wonderful theme of\r\nredemption. With our finite comprehension we may consider most earnestly\r\nthe shame and the glory, the life and the death, the justice and the\r\nmercy, that meet in the cross; yet with the utmost stretch of our mental\r\npowers we fail to grasp its full significance. The length and the breadth,\r\nthe depth and the height, of redeeming love are but dimly comprehended.\r\nThe plan of redemption will not be fully understood, even when the\r\nransomed see as they are seen and know as they are known; but through the\r\neternal ages, new truth will continually unfold to the wondering and\r\ndelighted mind. Though the griefs and pains and temptations of earth are\r\nended, and the cause removed, the people of God will ever have a distinct,\r\nintelligent knowledge of what their salvation has cost.\r\n\r\nThe cross of Christ will be the science and the song of the redeemed\r\nthrough all eternity. In Christ glorified they will behold Christ\r\ncrucified. Never will it be forgotten that He whose power created and\r\nupheld the unnumbered worlds through the vast realms of space, the Beloved\r\nof God, the Majesty of heaven, He whom cherub and shining seraph delighted\r\nto adore,—humbled Himself to uplift fallen man; that He bore the guilt and\r\nshame of sin, and the hiding of His Father’s face, till the woes of a lost\r\nworld broke His heart, and crushed out His life on Calvary’s cross. That\r\nthe Maker of all worlds, the Arbiter of all destinies, should lay aside\r\nHis glory, and humiliate Himself from love to man, will ever excite the\r\nwonder and adoration of the universe. As the nations of the saved look\r\nupon their Redeemer, and behold the eternal glory of the Father shining in\r\nHis countenance; as they behold His throne, which is from everlasting to\r\neverlasting, and know that His kingdom is to have no end, they break forth\r\nin rapturous song, “Worthy, worthy is the Lamb that was slain, and hath\r\nredeemed us to God by His own most precious blood!”\r\n\r\nThe mystery of the cross explains all other mysteries. In the light that\r\nstreams from Calvary, the attributes of God which had filled us with fear\r\nand awe appear beautiful and attractive. Mercy, tenderness, and parental\r\nlove are seen to blend with holiness, justice, and power. While we behold\r\nthe majesty of His throne, high and lifted up, we see His character in its\r\ngracious manifestations, and comprehend, as never before, the significance\r\nof that endearing title, “Our Father.”\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that He who is infinite in wisdom could devise no plan for\r\nour salvation except the sacrifice of His Son. The compensation for this\r\nsacrifice is the joy of peopling the earth with ransomed beings, holy,\r\nhappy, and immortal. The result of the Saviour’s conflict with the powers\r\nof darkness is joy to the redeemed, redounding to the glory of God\r\nthroughout eternity. And such is the value of the soul that the Father is\r\nsatisfied with the price paid; and Christ Himself, beholding the fruits of\r\nHis great sacrifice, is satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n41. DESOLATION OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\n“Her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her\r\niniquities.” “In the cup which she hath filled, fill to her double. How\r\nmuch she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment\r\nand sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no\r\nwidow, and shall see no sorrow. Therefore shall her plagues come in one\r\nday, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with\r\nfire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her. And the kings of the\r\nearth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her,\r\nshall bewail her, and lament for her, ... saying, Alas, alas that great\r\ncity Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment\r\ncome.”(1131)\r\n\r\n“The merchants of the earth,” that have “waxed rich through the abundance\r\nof her delicacies,” “shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment,\r\nweeping and wailing, and saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was\r\nclothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and\r\nprecious stones, and pearls! For in one hour so great riches is come to\r\nnaught.”(1132)\r\n\r\nSuch are the judgments that fall upon Babylon in the day of the visitation\r\nof God’s wrath. She has filled up the measure of her iniquity; her time\r\nhas come; she is ripe for destruction.\r\n\r\nWhen the voice of God turns the captivity of His people, there is a\r\nterrible awakening of those who have lost all in the great conflict of\r\nlife. While probation continued they were blinded by Satan’s deceptions,\r\nand they justified their course of sin. The rich prided themselves upon\r\ntheir superiority to those who were less favored; but they had obtained\r\ntheir riches by violation of the law of God. They had neglected to feed\r\nthe hungry, to clothe the naked, to deal justly, and to love mercy. They\r\nhad sought to exalt themselves, and to obtain the homage of their\r\nfellow-creatures. Now they are stripped of all that made them great, and\r\nare left destitute and defenseless. They look with terror upon the\r\ndestruction of the idols which they preferred before their Maker. They\r\nhave sold their souls for earthly riches and enjoyments, and have not\r\nsought to become rich toward God. The result is, their lives are a\r\nfailure; their pleasures are now turned to gall, their treasures to\r\ncorruption. The gain of a lifetime is swept away in a moment. The rich\r\nbemoan the destruction of their grand houses, the scattering of their gold\r\nand silver. But their lamentations are silenced by the fear that they\r\nthemselves are to perish with their idols.\r\n\r\nThe wicked are filled with regret, not because of their sinful neglect of\r\nGod and their fellow-men, but because God has conquered. They lament that\r\nthe result is what it is; but they do not repent of their wickedness. They\r\nwould leave no means untried to conquer if they could.\r\n\r\nThe world see the very class whom they have mocked and derided, and\r\ndesired to exterminate, pass unharmed through pestilence, tempest, and\r\nearthquake. He who is to the transgressors of His law a devouring fire, is\r\nto His people a safe pavilion.\r\n\r\nThe minister who has sacrificed truth to gain the favor of men, now\r\ndiscerns the character and influence of his teachings. It is apparent that\r\nthe omniscient eye was following him as he stood in the desk, as he walked\r\nthe streets, as he mingled with men in the various scenes of life. Every\r\nemotion of the soul, every line written, every word uttered, every act\r\nthat led men to rest in a refuge of falsehood, has been scattering seed;\r\nand now, in the wretched, lost souls around him, he beholds the harvest.\r\n\r\nSaith the Lord: “They have healed the hurt of the daughter of My people\r\nslightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.” “With lies ye\r\nhave made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and\r\nstrengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his\r\nwicked way, by promising him life.”(1133)\r\n\r\n“Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of My\r\npasture!... Behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings.” “Howl,\r\nye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of\r\nthe flock: for your days for slaughter and your dispersions are\r\naccomplished; ... and the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the\r\nprincipal of the flock to escape.”(1134)\r\n\r\nMinisters and people see that they have not sustained the right relation\r\nto God. They see that they have rebelled against the Author of all just\r\nand righteous law. The setting aside of the divine precepts gave rise to\r\nthousands of springs of evil, discord, hatred, iniquity, until the earth\r\nbecame one vast field of strife, one sink of corruption. This is the view\r\nthat now appears to those who rejected truth and chose to cherish error.\r\nNo language can express the longing which the disobedient and disloyal\r\nfeel for that which they have lost forever,—eternal life. Men whom the\r\nworld has worshiped for their talents and eloquence now see these things\r\nin their true light. They realize what they have forfeited by\r\ntransgression, and they fall at the feet of those whose fidelity they have\r\ndespised and derided, and confess that God has loved them.\r\n\r\nThe people see that they have been deluded. They accuse one another of\r\nhaving led them to destruction; but all unite in heaping their bitterest\r\ncondemnation upon the ministers. Unfaithful pastors have prophesied smooth\r\nthings; they have led their hearers to make void the law of God and to\r\npersecute those who would keep it holy. Now, in their despair, these\r\nteachers confess before the world their work of deception. The multitudes\r\nare filled with fury. “We are lost!” they cry, “and you are the cause of\r\nour ruin;” and they turn upon the false shepherds. The very ones that once\r\nadmired them most, will pronounce the most dreadful curses upon them. The\r\nvery hands that once crowned them with laurels, will be raised for their\r\ndestruction. The swords which were to slay God’s people, are now employed\r\nto destroy their enemies. Everywhere there is strife and bloodshed.\r\n\r\n“A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a\r\ncontroversy with the nations, He will plead with all flesh; He will give\r\nthem that are wicked to the sword.”(1135) For six thousand years the great\r\ncontroversy has been in progress; the Son of God and His heavenly\r\nmessengers have been in conflict with the power of the evil one, to warn,\r\nenlighten, and save the children of men. Now all have made their decision;\r\nthe wicked have fully united with Satan in his warfare against God. The\r\ntime has come for God to vindicate the authority of His downtrodden law.\r\nNow the controversy is not alone with Satan, but with men. “The Lord hath\r\na controversy with the nations;” “He will give them that are wicked to the\r\nsword.”\r\n\r\nThe mark of deliverance has been set upon those “that sigh and that cry\r\nfor all the abominations that be done.” Now the angel of death goes forth,\r\nrepresented in Ezekiel’s vision by the men with the slaughtering weapons,\r\nto whom the command is given: “Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and\r\nlittle children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the\r\nmark; and begin at My sanctuary.”(1136) Says the prophet, “They began at\r\nthe ancient men which were before the house.”(1137) The work of\r\ndestruction begins among those who have professed to be the spiritual\r\nguardians of the people. The false watchmen are the first to fall. There\r\nare none to pity or to spare. Men, women, maidens, and little children\r\nperish together.\r\n\r\n“The Lord cometh out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth\r\nfor their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no\r\nmore cover her slain.”(1138) “And this shall be the plague wherewith the\r\nLord will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem: Their\r\nflesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes\r\nshall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in\r\ntheir mouth. And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult\r\nfrom the Lord shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on\r\nthe hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of\r\nhis neighbor.”(1139) In the mad strife of their own fierce passions, and\r\nby the awful outpouring of God’s unmingled wrath, fall the wicked\r\ninhabitants of the earth,—priests, rulers, and people, rich and poor, high\r\nand low. “And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of\r\nthe earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be\r\nlamented, neither gathered, nor buried.”(1140)\r\n\r\nAt the coming of Christ the wicked are blotted from the face of the whole\r\nearth,—consumed with the spirit of His mouth, and destroyed by the\r\nbrightness of His glory. Christ takes His people to the city of God, and\r\nthe earth is emptied of its inhabitants. “Behold, the Lord maketh the\r\nearth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and\r\nscattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.” “The land shall be utterly\r\nemptied, and utterly spoiled: for the Lord hath spoken this word.”\r\n“Because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken\r\nthe everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and\r\nthey that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the\r\nearth are burned.”(1141)\r\n\r\nThe whole earth appears like a desolate wilderness. The ruins of cities\r\nand villages destroyed by the earthquake, uprooted trees, ragged rocks\r\nthrown out by the sea or torn out of the earth itself, are scattered over\r\nits surface, while vast caverns mark the spot where the mountains have\r\nbeen rent from their foundations.\r\n\r\nNow the event takes place, foreshadowed in the last solemn service of the\r\nday of atonement. When the ministration in the holy of holies had been\r\ncompleted, and the sins of Israel had been removed from the sanctuary by\r\nvirtue of the blood of the sin-offering, then the scapegoat was presented\r\nalive before the Lord; and in presence of the congregation the high priest\r\nconfessed over him “all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all\r\ntheir transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the\r\ngoat.”(1142) In like manner, when the work of atonement in the heavenly\r\nsanctuary has been completed, then in the presence of God and heavenly\r\nangels, and the host of the redeemed, the sins of God’s people will be\r\nplaced upon Satan; he will be declared guilty of all the evil which he has\r\ncaused them to commit. And as the scapegoat was sent away into a land not\r\ninhabited, so Satan will be banished to the desolate earth, an uninhabited\r\nand dreary wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe revelator foretells the banishment of Satan, and the condition of\r\nchaos and desolation to which the earth is to be reduced; and he declares\r\nthat this condition will exist for a thousand years. After presenting the\r\nscenes of the Lord’s second coming and the destruction of the wicked, the\r\nprophecy continues: “I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key\r\nof the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on\r\nthe dragon, that old serpent, which is the devil, and Satan, and bound him\r\na thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up,\r\nand set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till\r\nthe thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a\r\nlittle season.”(1143)\r\n\r\nThat the expression “bottomless pit” represents the earth in a state of\r\nconfusion and darkness, is evident from other scriptures. Concerning the\r\ncondition of the earth “in the beginning,” the Bible record says that it\r\n“was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the\r\ndeep.”(1144) Prophecy teaches that it will be brought back, partially at\r\nleast, to this condition. Looking forward to the great day of God, the\r\nprophet Jeremiah declares: “I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without\r\nform, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. I beheld the\r\nmountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. I\r\nbeheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were\r\nfled. I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the\r\ncities thereof were broken down.”(1145)\r\n\r\nHere is to be the home of Satan with his evil angels for a thousand years.\r\nLimited to the earth, he will not have access to other worlds, to tempt\r\nand annoy those who have never fallen. It is in this sense that he is\r\nbound: there are none remaining, upon whom he can exercise his power. He\r\nis wholly cut off from the work of deception and ruin which for so many\r\ncenturies has been his sole delight.\r\n\r\nThe prophet Isaiah, looking forward to the time of Satan’s overthrow,\r\nexclaims: “How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!\r\nhow art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!...\r\nThou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my\r\nthrone above the stars of God.” “I will be like the Most High. Yet thou\r\nshalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. They that see thee\r\nshall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man\r\nthat made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms; that made the\r\nworld as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that _opened not\r\nthe house of his prisoners_?”(1146)\r\n\r\nFor six thousand years, Satan’s work of rebellion has “made the earth to\r\ntremble.” He has “made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities\r\nthereof.” And “he opened not the house of his prisoners.” For six thousand\r\nyears his prison-house has received God’s people, and he would have held\r\nthem captive forever, but Christ has broken his bonds, and set the\r\nprisoners free.\r\n\r\nEven the wicked are now placed beyond the power of Satan; and alone with\r\nhis evil angels he remains to realize the effect of the curse which sin\r\nhas brought. “The kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory,\r\nevery one in his own house [the grave]. But thou art cast out of thy grave\r\nlike an abominable branch.... Thou shalt not be joined with them in\r\nburial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people.”(1147)\r\n\r\nFor a thousand years, Satan will wander to and fro in the desolate earth,\r\nto behold the results of his rebellion against the law of God. During this\r\ntime his sufferings are intense. Since his fall, his life of unceasing\r\nactivity has banished reflection; but he is now deprived of his power, and\r\nleft to contemplate the part which he has acted since first he rebelled\r\nagainst the government of heaven, and to look forward with trembling and\r\nterror to the dreadful future, when he must suffer for all the evil that\r\nhe has done, and be punished for the sins that he has caused to be\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\nTo God’s people, the captivity of Satan will bring gladness and rejoicing.\r\nSays the prophet: “It shall come to pass in the day that the Lord shall\r\ngive thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy trouble, and from the hard\r\nservice wherein thou wast made to serve, that thou shalt take up this\r\nproverb against the king of Babylon [here representing Satan], and say,\r\nHow hath the oppressor ceased!... The Lord hath broken the staff of the\r\nwicked, the scepter of the rulers; that smote the peoples in wrath with a\r\ncontinual stroke, that ruled the nations in anger, with a persecution that\r\nnone restrained.”(1148)\r\n\r\nDuring the thousand years between the first and the second resurrection,\r\nthe judgment of the wicked takes place. The apostle Paul points to this\r\njudgment as an event that follows the second advent. “Judge nothing before\r\nthe time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden\r\nthings of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the\r\nhearts.”(1149) Daniel declares that when the Ancient of days came,\r\n“judgment was given to the saints of the Most High.”(1150) At this time\r\nthe righteous reign as kings and priests unto God. John in the Revelation\r\nsays: “I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto\r\nthem.” “They shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with\r\nHim a thousand years.”(1151) It is at this time that, as foretold by Paul,\r\n“the saints shall judge the world.”(1152) In union with Christ they judge\r\nthe wicked, comparing their acts with the statute-book, the Bible, and\r\ndeciding every case according to the deeds done in the body. Then the\r\nportion which the wicked must suffer is meted out, according to their\r\nworks; and it is recorded against their names in the book of death.\r\n\r\nSatan also and evil angels are judged by Christ and His people. Says Paul,\r\n“Know ye not that we shall judge angel?”(1153) And Jude declares that “the\r\nangels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation,\r\nHe hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of\r\nthe great day.”(1154)\r\n\r\nAt the close of the thousand years the second resurrection will take\r\nplace. Then the wicked will be raised from the dead, and appear before God\r\nfor the execution of “the judgment written.” Thus the revelator, after\r\ndescribing the resurrection of the righteous, says, “The rest of the dead\r\nlived not again until the thousand years were finished.”(1155) And Isaiah\r\ndeclares, concerning the wicked, “They shall be gathered together, as\r\nprisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and\r\n_after many days shall they be visited_.”(1156)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n42. THE CONTROVERSY ENDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: Chapter header.]\r\n\r\nAt the close of the thousand years, Christ again returns to the earth. He\r\nis accompanied by the host of the redeemed, and attended by a retinue of\r\nangels. As He descends in terrific majesty, He bids the wicked dead arise\r\nto receive their doom. They come forth, a mighty host, numberless as the\r\nsands of the sea. What a contrast to those who were raised at the first\r\nresurrection! The righteous were clothed with immortal youth and beauty.\r\nThe wicked bear the traces of disease and death.\r\n\r\nEvery eye in that vast multitude is turned to behold the glory of the Son\r\nof God. With one voice the wicked hosts exclaim, “Blessed is He that\r\ncometh in the name of the Lord!” It is not love to Jesus that inspires\r\nthis utterance. The force of truth urges the words from unwilling lips. As\r\nthe wicked went into their graves, so they come forth, with the same\r\nenmity to Christ, and the same spirit of rebellion. They are to have no\r\nnew probation, in which to remedy the defects of their past lives. Nothing\r\nwould be gained by this. A lifetime of transgression has not softened\r\ntheir hearts. A second probation, were it given them, would be occupied as\r\nwas the first, in evading the requirements of God and exciting rebellion\r\nagainst Him.\r\n\r\nChrist descends upon the Mount of Olives, whence, after His resurrection,\r\nHe ascended, and where angels repeated the promise of His return. Says the\r\nprophet: “The Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with Thee.” “And\r\nHis feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, which is before\r\nJerusalem on the east, and the Mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst\r\nthereof, ... and there shall be a very great valley.” “And the Lord shall\r\nbe king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one Lord, and His\r\nname one.”(1157) As the New Jerusalem, in its dazzling splendor, comes\r\ndown out of heaven, it rests upon the place purified and made ready to\r\nreceive it, and Christ, with His people and the angels, enters the holy\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nNow Satan prepares for a last mighty struggle for the supremacy. While\r\ndeprived of his power, and cut off from his work of deception, the prince\r\nof evil was miserable and dejected: but as the wicked dead are raised, and\r\nhe sees the vast multitudes upon his side, his hopes revive, and he\r\ndetermines not to yield the great controversy. He will marshal all the\r\narmies of the lost under his banner, and through them endeavor to execute\r\nhis plans. The wicked are Satan’s captives. In rejecting Christ they have\r\naccepted the rule of the rebel leader. They are ready to receive his\r\nsuggestions and to do his bidding. Yet, true to his early cunning, he does\r\nnot acknowledge himself to be Satan. He claims to be the prince who is the\r\nrightful owner of the world, and whose inheritance has been unlawfully\r\nwrested from him. He represents himself to his deluded subjects as a\r\nredeemer, assuring them that his power has brought them forth from their\r\ngraves, and that he is about to rescue them from the most cruel tyranny.\r\nThe presence of Christ having been removed, Satan works wonders to support\r\nhis claims. He makes the weak strong, and inspires all with his own spirit\r\nand energy. He proposes to lead them against the camp of the saints, and\r\nto take possession of the city of God. With fiendish exultation he points\r\nto the unnumbered millions who have been raised from the dead, and\r\ndeclares that as their leader he is well able to overthrow the city, and\r\nregain his throne and his kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn that vast throng are multitudes of the long-lived race that existed\r\nbefore the flood; men of lofty stature and giant intellect, who, yielding\r\nto the control of fallen angels, devoted all their skill and knowledge to\r\nthe exaltation of themselves; men whose wonderful works of art led the\r\nworld to idolize their genius, but whose cruelty and evil inventions,\r\ndefiling the earth and defacing the image of God, caused Him to blot them\r\nfrom the face of His creation. There are kings and generals who conquered\r\nnations, valiant men who never lost a battle, proud, ambitious warriors\r\nwhose approach made kingdoms tremble. In death these experienced no\r\nchange. As they come up from the grave, they resume the current of their\r\nthoughts just where it ceased. They are actuated by the same desire to\r\nconquer that ruled them when they fell.\r\n\r\nSatan consults with his angels, and then with these kings and conquerors\r\nand mighty men. They look upon the strength and numbers on their side, and\r\ndeclare that the army within the city is small in comparison with theirs,\r\nand that it can be overcome. They lay their plans to take possession of\r\nthe riches and glory of the New Jerusalem. All immediately begin to\r\nprepare for battle. Skilful artisans construct implements of war. Military\r\nleaders, famed for their success, marshal the throngs of warlike men into\r\ncompanies and divisions.\r\n\r\nAt last the order to advance is given, and the countless host moves on,—an\r\narmy such as was never summoned by earthly conquerors, such as the\r\ncombined forces of all ages since war began on earth could never equal.\r\nSatan, the mightiest of warriors, leads the van, and his angels unite\r\ntheir forces for this final struggle. Kings and warriors are in his train,\r\nand the multitudes follow in vast companies, each under its appointed\r\nleader. With military precision, the serried ranks advance over the\r\nearth’s broken and uneven surface to the city of God. By command of Jesus,\r\nthe gates of the New Jerusalem are closed, and the armies of Satan\r\nsurround the city, and make ready for the onset.\r\n\r\nNow Christ again appears to the view of His enemies. Far above the city,\r\nupon a foundation of burnished gold, is a throne, high and lifted up. Upon\r\nthis throne sits the Son of God, and around Him are the subjects of His\r\nkingdom. The power and majesty of Christ no language can describe, no pen\r\nportray. The glory of the Eternal Father is enshrouding His Son. The\r\nbrightness of His presence fills the city of God, and flows out beyond the\r\ngates, flooding the whole earth with its radiance.\r\n\r\nNearest the throne are those who were once zealous in the cause of Satan,\r\nbut who, plucked as brands from the burning, have followed their Saviour\r\nwith deep, intense devotion. Next are those who perfected Christian\r\ncharacters in the midst of falsehood and infidelity, those who honored the\r\nlaw of God when the Christian world declared it void, and the millions, of\r\nall ages, who were martyred for their faith. And beyond is the “great\r\nmultitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and\r\npeople, and tongues, ... before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed\r\nwith white robes, and palms in their hands.”(1158) Their warfare is ended,\r\ntheir victory won. They have run the race and reached the prize. The palm\r\nbranch in their hands is a symbol of their triumph, the white robe an\r\nemblem of the spotless righteousness of Christ which now is theirs.\r\n\r\nThe redeemed raise a song of praise that echoes and re-echoes through the\r\nvaults of heaven, “Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and\r\nunto the Lamb.” And angel and seraph unite their voices in adoration. As\r\nthe redeemed have beheld the power and malignity of Satan, they have seen,\r\nas never before, that no power but that of Christ could have made them\r\nconquerors. In all that shining throng there are none to ascribe salvation\r\nto themselves, as if they had prevailed by their own power and goodness.\r\nNothing is said of what they have done or suffered; but the burden of\r\nevery song, the keynote of every anthem, is, Salvation to our God, and\r\nunto the Lamb.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of the assembled inhabitants of earth and heaven the final\r\ncoronation of the Son of God takes place. And now, invested with supreme\r\nmajesty and power, the King of kings pronounces sentence upon the rebels\r\nagainst His government, and executes justice upon those who have\r\ntransgressed His law and oppressed His people. Says the prophet of God: “I\r\nsaw a great white throne, and Him that sat on it, from whose face the\r\nearth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. And\r\nI saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were\r\nopened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the\r\ndead were judged out of those things which were written in the books,\r\naccording to their works.”(1159)\r\n\r\nAs soon as the books of record are opened, and the eye of Jesus looks upon\r\nthe wicked, they are conscious of every sin which they have ever\r\ncommitted. They see just where their feet diverged from the path of purity\r\nand holiness, just how far pride and rebellion have carried them in the\r\nviolation of the law of God. The seductive temptations which they\r\nencouraged by indulgence in sin, the blessings perverted, the messengers\r\nof God despised, the warnings rejected, the waves of mercy beaten back by\r\nthe stubborn, unrepentant heart,—all appear as if written in letters of\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nAbove the throne is revealed the cross; and like a panoramic view appear\r\nthe scenes of Adam’s temptation and fall, and the successive steps in the\r\ngreat plan of redemption. The Saviour’s lowly birth; His early life of\r\nsimplicity and obedience; His baptism in Jordan; the fast and temptation\r\nin the wilderness; His public ministry, unfolding to men heaven’s most\r\nprecious blessings; the days crowded with deeds of love and mercy, the\r\nnights of prayer and watching in the solitude of the mountains; the\r\nplottings of envy, hate, and malice which repaid His benefits; the awful,\r\nmysterious agony in Gethsemane, beneath the crushing weight of the sins of\r\nthe whole world; His betrayal into the hands of the murderous mob; the\r\nfearful events of that night of horror,—the unresisting prisoner, forsaken\r\nby His best-loved disciples, rudely hurried through the streets of\r\nJerusalem; the Son of God exultingly displayed before Annas, arraigned in\r\nthe high priest’s palace, in the judgment-hall of Pilate, before the\r\ncowardly and cruel Herod, mocked, insulted, tortured, and condemned to\r\ndie,—all are vividly portrayed.\r\n\r\nAnd now before the swaying multitude are revealed the final scenes,—the\r\npatient Sufferer treading the path to Calvary; the Prince of heaven\r\nhanging upon the cross; the haughty priests and the jeering rabble\r\nderiding His expiring agony; the supernatural darkness; the heaving earth,\r\nthe rent rocks, the open graves, marking the moment when the world’s\r\nRedeemer yielded up His life.\r\n\r\nThe awful spectacle appears just as it was. Satan, his angels, and his\r\nsubjects have no power to turn from the picture of their own work. Each\r\nactor recalls the part which he performed. Herod, who slew the innocent\r\nchildren of Bethlehem that he might destroy the King of Israel; the base\r\nHerodias, upon whose guilty soul rests the blood of John the Baptist; the\r\nweak, time-serving Pilate; the mocking soldiers; the priests and rulers\r\nand the maddened throng who cried, “His blood be on us, and on our\r\nchildren!”—all behold the enormity of their guilt. They vainly seek to\r\nhide from the divine majesty of His countenance, outshining the glory of\r\nthe sun, while the redeemed cast their crowns at the Saviour’s feet,\r\nexclaiming, “He died for me!”\r\n\r\nAmid the ransomed throng are the apostles of Christ, the heroic Paul, the\r\nardent Peter, the loved and loving John, and their true-hearted brethren,\r\nand with them the vast host of martyrs; while outside the walls, with\r\nevery vile and abominable thing, are those by whom they were persecuted,\r\nimprisoned, and slain. There is Nero, that monster of cruelty and vice,\r\nbeholding the joy and exaltation of those whom he once tortured, and in\r\nwhose extremest anguish he found satanic delight. His mother is there to\r\nwitness the result of her own work; to see how the evil stamp of character\r\ntransmitted to her son, the passions encouraged and developed by her\r\ninfluence and example, have borne fruit in crimes that caused the world to\r\nshudder.\r\n\r\nThere are papist priests and prelates, who claimed to be Christ’s\r\nambassadors, yet employed the rack, the dungeon, and the stake to control\r\nthe consciences of His people. There are the proud pontiffs who exalted\r\nthemselves above God, and presumed to change the law of the Most High.\r\nThose pretended fathers of the church have an account to render to God\r\nfrom which they would fain be excused. Too late they are made to see that\r\nthe Omniscient One is jealous of His law, and that He will in no wise\r\nclear the guilty. They learn now that Christ identifies His interest with\r\nthat of His suffering people; and they feel the force of His own words,\r\n“Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren,\r\nye have done it unto Me.”(1160)\r\n\r\nThe whole wicked world stand arraigned at the bar of God, on the charge of\r\nhigh treason against the government of heaven. They have none to plead\r\ntheir cause; they are without excuse; and the sentence of eternal death is\r\npronounced against them.\r\n\r\nIt is now evident to all that the wages of sin is not noble independence\r\nand eternal life, but slavery, ruin, and death. The wicked see what they\r\nhave forfeited by their life of rebellion. The far more exceeding and\r\neternal weight of glory was despised when offered them; but how desirable\r\nit now appears. “All this,” cries the lost soul, “I might have had; but I\r\nchose to put these things far from me. Oh, strange infatuation! I have\r\nexchanged peace, happiness, and honor, for wretchedness, infamy, and\r\ndespair.” All see that their exclusion from heaven is just. By their lives\r\nthey have declared, “We will not have this Jesus to reign over us.”\r\n\r\nAs if entranced, the wicked have looked upon the coronation of the Son of\r\nGod. They see in His hands the tables of the divine law, the statutes\r\nwhich they have despised and transgressed. They witness the outburst of\r\nwonder, rapture, and adoration from the saved; and as the wave of melody\r\nsweeps over the multitudes without the city, all with one voice exclaim,\r\n“Great and marvelous are Thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are\r\nThy ways, Thou King of saints;”(1161) and falling prostrate, they worship\r\nthe Prince of life.\r\n\r\nSatan seems paralyzed as he beholds the glory and majesty of Christ. He\r\nwho was once a covering cherub remembers whence he has fallen. A shining\r\nseraph, “son of the morning;” how changed, how degraded! From the council\r\nwhere once he was honored, he is forever excluded. He sees another now\r\nstanding near to the Father, veiling His glory. He has seen the crown\r\nplaced upon the head of Christ by an angel of lofty stature and majestic\r\npresence, and he knows that the exalted position of this angel might have\r\nbeen his.\r\n\r\nMemory recalls the home of his innocence and purity, the peace and content\r\nthat were his until he indulged in murmuring against God, and envy of\r\nChrist. His accusations, his rebellion, his deceptions to gain the\r\nsympathy and support of the angels, his stubborn persistence in making no\r\neffort for self-recovery when God would have granted him forgiveness,—all\r\ncome vividly before him. He reviews his work among men and its\r\nresults,—the enmity of man toward his fellow-man, the terrible destruction\r\nof life, the rise and fall of kingdoms, the overturning of thrones, the\r\nlong succession of tumults, conflicts, and revolutions. He recalls his\r\nconstant efforts to oppose the work of Christ and to sink man lower and\r\nlower. He sees that his hellish plots have been powerless to destroy those\r\nwho have put their trust in Jesus. As Satan looks upon his kingdom, the\r\nfruit of his toil, he sees only failure and ruin. He has led the\r\nmultitudes to believe that the city of God would be an easy prey; but he\r\nknows that this is false. Again and again, in the progress of the great\r\ncontroversy, he has been defeated, and compelled to yield. He knows too\r\nwell the power and majesty of the Eternal.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the great rebel has ever been to justify himself, and to prove\r\nthe divine government responsible for the rebellion. To this end he has\r\nbent all the power of his giant intellect. He has worked deliberately and\r\nsystematically, and with marvelous success, leading vast multitudes to\r\naccept his version of the great controversy which has been so long in\r\nprogress. For thousands of years this chief of conspiracy has palmed off\r\nfalsehood for truth. But the time has now come when the rebellion is to be\r\nfinally defeated, and the history and character of Satan disclosed. In his\r\nlast great effort to dethrone Christ, destroy His people, and take\r\npossession of the city of God, the arch-deceiver has been fully unmasked.\r\nThose who have united with him see the total failure of his cause.\r\nChrist’s followers and the loyal angels behold the full extent of his\r\nmachinations against the government of God. He is the object of universal\r\nabhorrence.\r\n\r\nSatan sees that his voluntary rebellion has unfitted him for heaven. He\r\nhas trained his powers to war against God: the purity, peace, and harmony\r\nof heaven would be to him supreme torture. His accusations against the\r\nmercy and justice of God are now silenced. The reproach which he has\r\nendeavored to cast upon Jehovah rests wholly upon himself. And now Satan\r\nbows down, and confesses the justice of his sentence.\r\n\r\n“Who shall not fear Thee, O Lord, and glorify Thy name? for Thou only art\r\nholy: for all nations shall come and worship before Thee; for Thy\r\njudgments are made manifest.”(1162) Every question of truth and error in\r\nthe long-standing controversy has now been made plain. The results of\r\nrebellion, the fruits of setting aside the divine statutes, have been laid\r\nopen to the view of all created intelligences. The working out of Satan’s\r\nrule in contrast with the government of God, has been presented to the\r\nwhole universe. Satan’s own works have condemned him. God’s wisdom, His\r\njustice, and His goodness stand fully vindicated. It is seen that all His\r\ndealings in the great controversy have been conducted with respect to the\r\neternal good of His people, and the good of all the worlds that He has\r\ncreated. “All Thy works shall praise Thee, O Lord; and Thy saints shall\r\nbless Thee.”(1163) The history of sin will stand to all eternity as a\r\nwitness that with the existence of God’s law is bound up the happiness of\r\nall the beings He has created. With all the facts of the great controversy\r\nin view, the whole universe, both loyal and rebellious, with one accord\r\ndeclare, “Just and true are Thy ways, Thou King of saints.”\r\n\r\nBefore the universe has been clearly presented the great sacrifice made by\r\nthe Father and the Son in man’s behalf. The hour has come when Christ\r\noccupies His rightful position, and is glorified above principalities and\r\npowers and every name that is named. It was for the joy that was set\r\nbefore Him,—that He might bring many sons unto glory,—that He endured the\r\ncross and despised the shame. And inconceivably great as was the sorrow\r\nand the shame, yet greater is the joy and the glory. He looks upon the\r\nredeemed, renewed in His own image, every heart bearing the perfect\r\nimpress of the divine, every face reflecting the likeness of their King.\r\nHe beholds in them the result of the travail of His soul, and He is\r\nsatisfied. Then, in a voice that reaches the assembled multitudes of the\r\nrighteous and the wicked, He declares, “Behold the purchase of My blood!\r\nFor these I suffered, for these I died, that they might dwell in My\r\npresence throughout eternal ages.” And the song of praise ascends from the\r\nwhite-robed ones about the throne, “Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to\r\nreceive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory,\r\nand blessing.”(1164)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that Satan has been constrained to acknowledge God’s\r\njustice, and to bow to the supremacy of Christ, his character remains\r\nunchanged. The spirit of rebellion, like a mighty torrent, again bursts\r\nforth. Filled with frenzy, he determines not to yield the great\r\ncontroversy. The time has come for a last desperate struggle against the\r\nKing of heaven. He rushes into the midst of his subjects, and endeavors to\r\ninspire them with his own fury, and arouse them to instant battle. But of\r\nall the countless millions whom he has allured into rebellion, there are\r\nnone now to acknowledge his supremacy. His power is at an end. The wicked\r\nare filled with the same hatred of God that inspires Satan; but they see\r\nthat their case is hopeless, that they cannot prevail against Jehovah.\r\nTheir rage is kindled against Satan and those who have been his agents in\r\ndeception, and with the fury of demons they turn upon them.\r\n\r\nSaith the Lord: “Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God;\r\nbehold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the\r\nnations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy\r\nwisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness. They shall bring thee down\r\nto the pit.” “I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of\r\nthe stones of fire.... I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee\r\nbefore kings, that they may behold thee.... I will bring thee to ashes\r\nupon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.... Thou shalt be\r\na terror, and never shalt thou be any more.”(1165)\r\n\r\n“Every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled\r\nin blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.” “The\r\nindignation of the Lord is upon all nations, and His fury upon all their\r\narmies: He hath utterly destroyed them, He hath delivered them to the\r\nslaughter.” “Upon the wicked He shall rain quick burning coals, fire and\r\nbrimstone, and a horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their\r\ncup.”(1166) Fire comes down from God out of heaven. The earth is broken\r\nup. The weapons concealed in its depths are drawn forth. Devouring flames\r\nburst from every yawning chasm. The very rocks are on fire. The day has\r\ncome that shall burn as an oven. The elements melt with fervent heat, the\r\nearth also, and the works that are therein are burned up.(1167) The\r\nearth’s surface seems one molten mass,—a vast, seething lake of fire. It\r\nis the time of the judgment and perdition of ungodly men,—“the day of the\r\nLord’s vengeance, and the year of recompenses for the controversy of\r\nZion.”(1168)\r\n\r\nThe wicked receive their recompense in the earth.(1169) They “shall be\r\nstubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of\r\nhosts.”(1170) Some are destroyed as in a moment, while others suffer many\r\ndays. All are punished “according to their deeds.” The sins of the\r\nrighteous having been transferred to Satan, he is made to suffer not only\r\nfor his own rebellion, but for all the sins which he has caused God’s\r\npeople to commit. His punishment is to be far greater than that of those\r\nwhom he has deceived. After all have perished who fell by his deceptions,\r\nhe is still to live and suffer on. In the cleansing flames the wicked are\r\nat last destroyed, root and branch,—Satan the root, his followers the\r\nbranches. The full penalty of the law has been visited; the demands of\r\njustice have been met; and heaven and earth, beholding, declare the\r\nrighteousness of Jehovah.\r\n\r\nSatan’s work of ruin is forever ended. For six thousand years he has\r\nwrought his will, filling the earth with woe, and causing grief throughout\r\nthe universe. The whole creation has groaned and travailed together in\r\npain. Now God’s creatures are forever delivered from his presence and\r\ntemptations. “The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they [the\r\nrighteous] break forth into singing.”(1171) And a shout of praise and\r\ntriumph ascends from the whole loyal universe. “The voice of a great\r\nmultitude,” “as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty\r\nthunderings,” is heard, saying, “Alleluia; for the Lord God omnipotent\r\nreigneth.”\r\n\r\nWhile the earth was wrapped in the fire of destruction, the righteous\r\nabode safely in the holy city. Upon those that had part in the first\r\nresurrection, the second death has no power. While God is to the wicked a\r\nconsuming fire, He is to His people both a sun and a shield.(1172)\r\n\r\n“I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first\r\nearth were passed away.”(1173) The fire that consumes the wicked purifies\r\nthe earth. Every trace of the curse is swept away. No eternally burning\r\nhell will keep before the ransomed the fearful consequences of sin.\r\n\r\nOne reminder alone remains: our Redeemer will ever bear the marks of His\r\ncrucifixion. Upon His wounded head, upon His side, His hands and feet, are\r\nthe only traces of the cruel work that sin has wrought. Says the prophet,\r\nbeholding Christ in His glory, “He had bright beams coming out of His\r\nside: and there was the hiding of His power.”(1174) That pierced side\r\nwhence flowed the crimson stream that reconciled man to God,—there is the\r\nSaviour’s glory, there “the hiding of His power.” “Mighty to save,”\r\nthrough the sacrifice of redemption, He was therefore strong to execute\r\njustice upon them that despised God’s mercy. And the tokens of His\r\nhumiliation are His highest honor; through the eternal ages the wounds of\r\nCalvary will show forth His praise, and declare His power.\r\n\r\n“O tower of the flock, the stronghold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee\r\nshall it come, even the first dominion.”(1175) The time has come, to which\r\nholy men have looked with longing since the flaming sword barred the first\r\npair from Eden,—the time for “the redemption of the purchased\r\npossession.”(1176) The earth originally given to man as his kingdom,\r\nbetrayed by him into the hands of Satan, and so long held by the mighty\r\nfoe, has been brought back by the great plan of redemption. All that was\r\nlost by sin has been restored. “Thus saith the Lord ... that formed the\r\nearth and made it; He hath established it, He created it not in vain, He\r\nformed it to be inhabited.”(1177) God’s original purpose in the creation\r\nof the earth is fulfilled as it is made the eternal abode of the redeemed.\r\n“The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein forever.”(1178)\r\n\r\nA fear of making the future inheritance seem too material has led many to\r\nspiritualize away the very truths which lead us to look upon it as our\r\nhome. Christ assured His disciples that He went to prepare mansions for\r\nthem in the Father’s house. Those who accept the teachings of God’s word\r\nwill not be wholly ignorant concerning the heavenly abode. And yet, “eye\r\nhath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man,\r\nthe things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.”(1179) Human\r\nlanguage is inadequate to describe the reward of the righteous. It will be\r\nknown only to those who behold it. No finite mind can comprehend the glory\r\nof the Paradise of God.\r\n\r\nIn the Bible the inheritance of the saved is called a country.(1180) There\r\nthe heavenly Shepherd leads His flock to fountains of living waters. The\r\ntree of life yields its fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree are\r\nfor the service of the nations. There are ever-flowing streams, clear as\r\ncrystal, and beside them waving trees cast their shadows upon the paths\r\nprepared for the ransomed of the Lord. There the wide-spreading plains\r\nswell into hills of beauty, and the mountains of God rear their lofty\r\nsummits. On those peaceful plains, beside those living streams, God’s\r\npeople, so long pilgrims and wanderers, shall find a home.\r\n\r\n“My people shall dwell in a peaceful habitation, and in sure dwellings,\r\nand in quiet resting-places.” “Violence shall no more be heard in thy\r\nland, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy\r\nwalls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.” “They shall build houses, and\r\ninhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them,\r\nThey shall not build, and another inhabit; they shalt not plant, and\r\nanother eat:... Mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their\r\nhands.”(1181)\r\n\r\nThere, “the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and\r\nthe desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.” “Instead of the thorn\r\nshall come up the fir-tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the\r\nmyrtle-tree.”(1182) “The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the\r\nleopard shall lie down with the kid; ... and a little child shall lead\r\nthem.” “They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain,”(1183)\r\nsaith the Lord.\r\n\r\nPain cannot exist in the atmosphere of heaven. There will be no more\r\ntears, no funeral trains, no badges of mourning. “There shall be no more\r\ndeath, neither sorrow, nor crying, ... for the former things are passed\r\naway.”(1184) “The inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that\r\ndwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.”(1185)\r\n\r\nThere is the New Jerusalem, the metropolis of the glorified new earth, “a\r\ncrown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of\r\nthy God.”(1186) “Her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like\r\na jasper stone, clear as crystal.” “The nations of them which are saved\r\nshall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their\r\nglory and honor into it.”(1187) Saith the Lord, “I will rejoice in\r\nJerusalem, and joy in My people.”(1188) “The tabernacle of God is with\r\nmen, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God\r\nHimself shall be with them, and be their God.”(1189)\r\n\r\nIn the city of God “there shall be no night.” None will need or desire\r\nrepose. There will be no weariness in doing the will of God and offering\r\npraise to His name. We shall ever feel the freshness of the morning, and\r\nshall ever be far from its close. “And they need no candle, neither light\r\nof the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light.”(1190) The light of the\r\nsun will be superseded by a radiance which is not painfully dazzling, yet\r\nwhich immeasurably surpasses the brightness of our noontide. The glory of\r\nGod and the Lamb floods the holy city with unfading light. The redeemed\r\nwalk in the sunless glory of perpetual day.\r\n\r\n“I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the\r\ntemple of it.”(1191) The people of God are privileged to hold open\r\ncommunion with the Father and the Son. “Now we see through a glass,\r\ndarkly.”(1192) We behold the image of God reflected, as in a mirror, in\r\nthe works of nature and in His dealings with men; but then we shall see\r\nHim face to face, without a dimming veil between. We shall stand in His\r\npresence, and behold the glory of His countenance.\r\n\r\nThere the redeemed shall “know, even as also they are known.” The loves\r\nand sympathies which God Himself has planted in the soul, shall there find\r\ntruest and sweetest exercise. The pure communion with holy beings, the\r\nharmonious social life with the blessed angels and with the faithful ones\r\nof all ages, who have washed their robes and made them white in the blood\r\nof the Lamb, the sacred ties that bind together “the whole family in\r\nheaven and earth,”(1193)—these help to constitute the happiness of the\r\nredeemed.\r\n\r\nThere, immortal minds will contemplate with never-failing delight the\r\nwonders of creative power, the mysteries of redeeming love. There will be\r\nno cruel, deceiving foe to tempt to forgetfulness of God. Every faculty\r\nwill be developed, every capacity increased. The acquirement of knowledge\r\nwill not weary the mind or exhaust the energies. There the grandest\r\nenterprises may be carried forward, the loftiest aspirations reached, the\r\nhighest ambitions realized; and still there will arise new heights to\r\nsurmount, new wonders to admire, new truths to comprehend, fresh objects\r\nto call forth the powers of mind and soul and body.\r\n\r\nAll the treasures of the universe will be open to the study of God’s\r\nredeemed. Unfettered by mortality, they wing their tireless flight to\r\nworlds afar,—worlds that thrilled with sorrow at the spectacle of human\r\nwoe, and rang with songs of gladness at the tidings of a ransomed soul.\r\nWith unutterable delight the children of earth enter into the joy and the\r\nwisdom of unfallen beings. They share the treasures of knowledge and\r\nunderstanding gained through ages upon ages in contemplation of God’s\r\nhandiwork. With undimmed vision they gaze upon the glory of creation,—suns\r\nand stars and systems, all in their appointed order circling the throne of\r\nDeity. Upon all things, from the least to the greatest, the Creator’s name\r\nis written, and in all are the riches of His power displayed.\r\n\r\nAnd the years of eternity, as they roll, will bring richer and still more\r\nglorious revelations of God and of Christ. As knowledge is progressive, so\r\nwill love, reverence, and happiness increase. The more men learn of God,\r\nthe greater will be their admiration of His character. As Jesus opens\r\nbefore them the riches of redemption, and the amazing achievements in the\r\ngreat controversy with Satan, the hearts of the ransomed thrill with more\r\nfervent devotion, and with more rapturous joy they sweep the harps of\r\ngold; and ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands of\r\nvoices unite to swell the mighty chorus of praise.\r\n\r\n“And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the\r\nearth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I\r\nsaying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that\r\nsitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever.”(1194)\r\n\r\nThe great controversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no more. The entire\r\nuniverse is clean. One pulse of harmony and gladness beats through the\r\nvast creation. From Him who created all, flow life and light and gladness,\r\nthroughout the realms of illimitable space. From the minutest atom to the\r\ngreatest world, all things, animate and inanimate, in their unshadowed\r\nbeauty and perfect joy, declare that God is love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Notes.\r\n\r\nPage 50. TITLES.—In a passage which forms a part of the Roman canon law,\r\nPope Innocent III. declares that the Roman pontiff is “the vicegerent upon\r\nearth, not of a mere man, but of very God;” and in a gloss on the passage\r\nit is explained that this is because he is the vicegerent of Christ, who\r\nis “very God and very man.” (See Decretal. D. Gregor. Pap. IX. lib. 1. de\r\ntranslat. Episc. tit. 7. c. 3. Corp. Jur. Canon. ed. Paris, 1612; tom. II.\r\nDecretal. col. 205.)\r\n\r\nFor the title, “Lord God the Pope,” see a gloss on the Extravagantes of\r\nPope John XXII., title 14, ch. 4, “_Declaramus_.” In an Antwerp edition of\r\nthe Extravagantes, dated 1584, the words “_Dominum Deum nostrum Papam_”\r\n(\"Our Lord God the Pope\") occur in column 153. In a Paris edition, dated\r\n1612, they occur in column 140. In several editions published since 1612,\r\nthe word “_Deum_” (\"God\") has been omitted.\r\n\r\nPage 52. IMAGE WORSHIP.—“The worship of images ... was one of those\r\ncorruptions of Christianity which crept into the church stealthily and\r\nalmost without notice or observation. This corruption did not, like other\r\nheresies, develop itself at once, for in that case it would have met with\r\ndecided censure and rebuke: but, making its commencement under a fair\r\ndisguise, so gradually was one practice after another introduced in\r\nconnection with it, that the church had become deeply steeped in practical\r\nidolatry, not only without any efficient opposition, but almost without\r\nany decided remonstrance; and when at length an endeavor was made to root\r\nit out, the evil was found too deeply fixed to admit of removal.... It\r\nmust be traced to the idolatrous tendency of the human heart, and its\r\npropensity to serve the creature more than the Creator....\r\n\r\n“Images and pictures were first introduced into churches, not to be\r\nworshiped, but either in the place of books to give instruction to those\r\nwho could not read, or to excite devotion in the minds of others. How far\r\nthey ever answered such a purpose is doubtful; but, even granting that\r\nthis was the case for a time, it soon ceased to be so, and it was found\r\nthat pictures and images brought into churches darkened rather than\r\nenlightened the minds of the ignorant—degraded rather than exalted the\r\ndevotion of the worshiper. So that, however they might have been intended\r\nto direct men’s minds to God, they ended in turning them from Him to the\r\nworship of created things.”—_J. Mendham, __“__The Seventh General Council,\r\nthe Second of Nicæa,__”__ Introduction, pp. iii-vi._\r\n\r\nFor a record of the proceedings and decisions of the Second Council of\r\nNice, A.D. 787, called to establish the worship of images, see Baronius,\r\n“Ecclesiastical Annals,” Vol. IX, pp. 391-407 (1612 Antwerp ed.); J.\r\nMendham, “The Seventh General Council, the Second of Nicæa;” Ed.\r\nStillingfleet, “Defence of the Discourse Concerning the Idolatry Practiced\r\nin the Church of Rome” (London, 1686); “A Select Library of Nicene and\r\nPost-Nicene Fathers,” second series, Vol. XIV, pp. 521-587 (N.

EDICT OF CONSTANTINE.—The law issued by Constantine on the\r\nseventh of March, A.D. 321, regarding a day of rest, reads thus:\r\n\r\n“Let all judges, and all city people, and all tradesmen, rest upon the\r\nvenerable day of the sun. But let those dwelling in the country freely and\r\nwith full liberty attend to the culture of their fields; since it\r\nfrequently happens, that no other day is so fit for the sowing of grain,\r\nor the planting of vines; hence the favorable time should not be allowed\r\nto pass, lest the provisions of heaven be lost.”—_A. H. Lewis,\r\n__“__History of the Sabbath and the Sunday,__”__ pp. 123, 124 (2d ed.,\r\nrev., 1903)._\r\n\r\nThe original (in the “Codex of Justinian,” lib. 3, tit. 12, leg. 3) is\r\nquoted by Dr. J. A. Hessey in his Bampton Lectures on “Sunday,” lecture 3,\r\npar. 1, and by Dr. Philip Schaff in his “History of the Christian Church,”\r\nVol. III, sec. 75, par. 5, note 1.

FORGED WRITINGS.—Among the documents that at the present time are\r\ngenerally admitted to be forgeries, the Donation of Constantine and the\r\nPseudo-Isidorian Decretals are of primary importance.\r\n\r\nIn citing facts concerning the question, “When and by whom was\r\nConstantine’s Donation forged?” M. Gosselin, Director of the Seminary of\r\nSt. Sulpice (Paris), says:\r\n\r\n“Though this document is unquestionably spurious, it would be difficult to\r\ndetermine with precision the date of its fabrication. M. de Marca,\r\nMuratori, and other learned critics, are of the opinion that it was\r\ncomposed in the eighth century, before the reign of Charlemagne. Muratori,\r\nmoreover, thinks it probable that it may have induced that monarch and\r\nPepin to be so generous to the Holy See.”—_Gosselin_, “_The Power of the\r\nPope during the Middle Ages_,” _Vol. I_, _p. 321_ (translated by the Rev.\r\nMatthew Kelly, St. Patrick’s College, Maynooth; Baltimore, J. Murphy &\r\nCo., 1853).\r\n\r\nOn the date of the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals, see Mosheim,\r\n“Ecclesiastical History,” bk. 3, cent. 9, part 2, ch. 2, sec. 8. As Dr.\r\nMurdock, the translator, points out in a foot-note, the learned Catholic\r\nhistorian, M. L’Abbé Fleury, in his “Ecclesiastical History” (diss. 4,\r\nsec. 1), says of these decretals, that “they crept to light near the close\r\nof the eighth century.” Fleury, writing near the close of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, says further that these “false decretals were looked upon as\r\nauthentic for the space of eight hundred years; and it was with much\r\ndifficulty that they were given up in the last century. It is true that at\r\npresent there are hardly any, though meanly instructed in these matters,\r\nwho do not acknowledge that these decretals are false.”—_Fleury_,\r\n“_Ecclesiastical History_,” _bk. 44_, _par. 54_ (G. Adam’s translation,\r\nLondon, 1732, Vol. V, p. 196). See also Gibbon, “Decline and Fall of the\r\nRoman Empire,” ch. 49, par. 16.\r\n\r\nPage 57.

PURGATORY.—Dr. Joseph Faa Di Bruno thus defines purgatory:\r\n“Purgatory is a state of suffering after this life, in which those souls\r\nare for a time detained, who depart this life after their deadly sins have\r\nbeen remitted as to the stain and guilt, and as to the everlasting pain\r\nthat was due to them; but who have on account of those sins still some\r\ndebt of temporal punishment to pay; as also those souls which leave this\r\nworld guilty only of venial sins.”—“_Catholic Belief_,” _page 196_ (ed.\r\n1884; imprimateur Archbishop of New York).\r\n\r\nSee also K.

John Gerard, S. J., and published in London, 1902, by the\r\nCatholic Truth Society. In this work it is said that “the mainspring of\r\nthe whole organization of the Society is a spirit of entire obedience:\r\n‘Let each one,’ writes St. Ignatius, ‘persuade himself that those who live\r\nunder obedience ought to allow themselves to be moved and directed by\r\ndivine Providence through their superiors, just as though they were a dead\r\nbody, which allows itself to be carried anywhere and to be treated in any\r\nmanner whatever, or as an old man’s staff, which serves him who holds it\r\nin his hand in whatsoever way he will.’\r\n\r\n“This absolute submission is ennobled by its motive, and should be,\r\ncontinues the ... founder, ‘prompt, joyous, and persevering; ... the\r\nobedient religious accomplishes joyfully that which his superiors have\r\nconfided to him for the general good, assured that thereby he corresponds\r\ntruly with the divine will.’ ”—_The Comtesse R. de Courson, in\r\n__“__Concerning Jesuits,__”__ p. 6._\r\n\r\nSee also L.

EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS AND DESTROY THE BIBLE.—Referring to the\r\nlong-continued efforts in France to suppress the Bible—particularly\r\nversions in the language of the common people, Gaussen says: “The decree\r\nof Toulouse, 1229,” which established the “tribunal of the Inquisition\r\nagainst all the readers of the Bible in the vulgar tongue, ... was an\r\nedict of fire, bloodshed, and devastation. In its 3d, 4th, 5th, and 6th\r\nchapters, it ordained the entire destruction of the houses, the humblest\r\nplaces of concealment, and even the subterranean retreats of men convicted\r\nof possessing the Scriptures; that they should be pursued to the forests\r\nand caves of the earth; and that even those who harbored them should be\r\nseverely punished.” As a result, the Bible “was everywhere prohibited; it\r\nvanished, as it were, underground; it descended into the tomb.” These\r\ndecrees were “followed for five hundred years by innumerable punishments,\r\nin which the blood of the saints flowed like water.”—_L. Gaussen, __“__The\r\nCanon of the Holy Scriptures,__”__ __ part 2, bk. 2, ch. 7, sec. 5, prop.\r\n561; and ch. 13, sec. 2, prop. 641, par. 2._\r\n\r\nOn the special efforts made to destroy Bibles during the Reign of Terror,\r\nlate in 1793, Dr. Lorimer says: “Wherever a Bible could be found it might\r\nbe said to be persecuted to death; so much so, that several respectable\r\ncommentators interpret the slaying of the two witnesses in the eleventh\r\nchapter of the Apocalypse, of the general suppression, nay, destruction,\r\nof the Old and New Testaments in France at this period.”—_J.

THE CIRCULATION OF THE SCRIPTURES.—In 1804, according to Mr.\r\nWilliam Canton, of the British and Foreign Bible Society, “all the Bibles\r\nextant in the world, in manuscript or in print, counting every version in\r\nevery land, were computed at not many more than four millions.... The\r\nvarious languages in which those four millions were written, including\r\nsuch bygone speech as the Mœso-Gothic of Ulfilas and the Anglo-Saxon of\r\nBede, are set down as numbering about fifty.”—“_What Is the Bible\r\nSociety?_” p. 23 (rev. ed., 1904).\r\n\r\nA hundred years later, at the close of its first centenary, the British\r\nand Foreign Bible Society was able to report a total distribution of\r\nBibles, Testaments, or portions thereof, by that society alone, to the\r\nnumber of 186,680,101—a total that, in 1910, had grown to upwards of\r\n220,000,000 copies, in nearly four hundred distinct tongues.\r\n\r\nTo these totals must be added the millions of copies of the Scriptures or\r\nportions thereof, in many languages, distributed by other Bible societies\r\nand by various commercial agencies. The American Bible Society,—the\r\ngreatest of the daughters of the British parent society,—during the first\r\nninety-four years of its work, reported a total distribution of 87,296,182\r\ncopies. (See _Bible Society Record_, June, 1910.) According to\r\nconservative estimates, about six million copies of the Bible are printed\r\nannually by commercial houses, which, added to the combined output of the\r\nBible societies, gives a total yearly circulation of more than fifteen\r\nmillion copies.\r\n\r\nThe Scriptures, in whole or in part, have been printed in more than five\r\nhundred distinct tongues; and the work of translation into new languages\r\nand dialects is still carried forward with unflagging zeal.\r\n\r\nPage 288. FOREIGN MISSIONS.—Dr. G. P. Fisher, in a chapter on “Christian\r\nMissions” in his “History of the Christian Church,” outlines the\r\nbeginnings of the missionary movement, which, in “the later years of the\r\neighteenth century, ushered in a brilliant era of missionary activity, an\r\nera which, in the history of missions, is only less remarkable than the\r\nfirst of the Christian ages.” In 1792, “the Baptist society was founded,\r\nwith Carey as one of its first missionaries. Carey sailed for India, and\r\nthere, with the help of other members of the same society, founded the\r\nmission of Serampore.” In 1795, the London Missionary Society was founded;\r\nin 1799, there was formed “the organization which in 1812 became the\r\nChurch Missionary Society.” Soon afterward, the Wesleyan Missionary\r\nSociety was founded.\r\n\r\n“While the missionary activity was growing up in Great Britain, the\r\nChristians of America were becoming animated with a like zeal.” In 1812,\r\nthey founded the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions; and\r\nin 1814, the American Baptist Missionary Union. Adoniram Judson, one of\r\nthe first missionaries to go out from America, sailed for Calcutta in\r\n1812, and reached Burmah in July, 1813. In 1837, the Presbyterian Board\r\nwas formed. (See Fisher, “History of the Christian Church,” period 9, ch.\r\n7, par. 3-25.)\r\n\r\nDr. A. T. Pierson, in an article published in the _Missionary Review of\r\nthe World_ for January, 1910, declares: “A half-century ago, China and\r\nManchuria, Japan and Korea, Turkey and Arabia, and even the vast continent\r\nof Africa, were sleeping—hermit nations, locked in the cell of long\r\nseclusion and exclusion. Central Asia was comparatively unexplored, as was\r\nCentral Africa. In many lands, Satan’s long occupation was undisputed and\r\nhis empire unmolested. Papal countries were as intolerant as pagan; Italy\r\nand Spain imprisoned a man for daring to sell a Bible, or preach the\r\ngospel. France was practically infidel, and Germany permeated with\r\nrationalism; and over a large part of the mission field, the doors were\r\nshut and locked by a more or less rigid exclusion and caste system. Now\r\nthe changes, on every side, are so remarkable and so radical that, to one\r\nwho should suddenly come out of this middle period of the last century,\r\n... the world would be unrecognizable. He who holds the keys of the\r\ntwo-leaved gates has been unlocking them, opening up all lands to the\r\nMessenger of the Cross. Even in the Eternal City, where, a half-century\r\nago, a visitor had to leave his Bible outside the walls, there are\r\nProtestant chapels by the score, and a free circulation of the\r\nScriptures.”\r\n\r\nPage 327. PROPHETIC DATES.—See note for page 329.\r\n\r\nPage 329. PROPHETIC DATES.—The historical and chronological facts\r\nconnected with the prophetic periods of Daniel 8 and 9, including many\r\nevidences pointing unmistakably to the year 457 B.C. as the proper time\r\nfrom which to begin reckoning these periods, have been clearly outlined by\r\nmany students of prophecy. See Stanley Leathes, “Old Testament Prophecy,”\r\nlectures 10, 11 (Warburton Lectures for 1876-1880); W.

ASCENSION ROBES.—The story that the Adventists made robes with\r\nwhich to ascend “to meet the Lord in the air,” was invented by those who\r\nwished to reproach the cause. It was circulated so industriously that many\r\nbelieved it; but careful inquiry proved its falsity. For many years a\r\nlarge reward has been offered for proof that one such instance ever\r\noccurred, but the proof has not been produced. None who loved the\r\nappearing of the Saviour were so ignorant of the teachings of the\r\nScriptures as to suppose that robes which they could make would be\r\nnecessary for that occasion. The only robe which the saints will need to\r\nmeet the Lord is the righteousness of Christ. See Rev. 19:8.\r\n\r\nPage 374. THE CHRONOLOGY OF PROPHECY.—Dr. Geo. Bush, Professor of Hebrew\r\nand Oriental Literature in the New York City University, in a letter\r\naddressed to Mr. Miller, and published in the _Advent Herald, and Signs of\r\nthe Times Reporter_, Boston, March 6 and 13, 1844, made some important\r\nadmissions relative to his calculation of the prophetic times. Mr. Bush\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n“Neither is it to be objected, as I conceive, to yourself or your friends,\r\nthat you have devoted much time and attention to the study of the\r\n_chronology_ of prophecy, and have labored much to determine the\r\ncommencing and closing dates of its great periods. If these periods are\r\nactually given by the Holy Ghost in the prophetic books, it was doubtless\r\nwith the design that they _should_ be studied, and probably, in the end,\r\nfully understood; and no man is to be charged with presumptuous folly who\r\nreverently makes the attempt to do this.... In taking a _day_ as the\r\nprophetical term for a _year_, I believe you are sustained by the soundest\r\nexegesis, as well as fortified by the high names of Mede, Sir Isaac\r\nNewton, Kirby, Scott, Keith, and a host of others, who have long since\r\ncome to substantially your conclusions on this head. They all agree that\r\nthe leading periods mentioned by Daniel and John do actually expire _about\r\nthis age of the world_, and it would be a strange logic that would convict\r\nyou of heresy for holding in effect the same views which stand forth so\r\nprominently in the notices of these eminent divines.” “Your results in\r\nthis field of inquiry do not strike me as so far out of the way as to\r\naffect any of the great interests of truth and duty.” “Your error, as I\r\napprehend, lies in another direction than your chronology.” “You have\r\nentirely mistaken _the nature of the events_ which are to occur when those\r\nperiods have expired. This is the head and front of your expository\r\noffending.”\r\n\r\nPage 399. PROPHETIC DATES.—See note for page 329.\r\n\r\nPage 435. A THREEFOLD MESSAGE.—Rev. 14:6, 7, foretells the proclamation of\r\nthe first angel’s message. Then the prophet continues: “There followed\r\nanother angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, ... and the third\r\nangel followed them.” The word here rendered “followed,” means, in\r\nconstructions like that in this text, “to go with.” Liddell and Scott\r\nrender the word thus: “_To follow one, go after_ or _with_ him.” Robinson\r\nsays: “_To follow, to go with, to accompany_ any one.” It is the same word\r\nthat is used in Mark 5:24: “Jesus went with him; and much people followed\r\nHim, and thronged Him.” It is also used of the redeemed one hundred and\r\nforty-four thousand, where it is said, “These are they which follow the\r\nLamb whithersoever He goeth.” Rev. 14:4. In both these places it is\r\nevident that the idea intended to be conveyed is that of going together,\r\nin company with. So in 1 Cor. 10:4, where we read of the children of\r\nIsrael that “they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them,” the\r\nword “followed” is translated from the same Greek word, and the margin has\r\nit, “went with them.” From this we learn that the idea in Rev. 14:8, 9, is\r\nnot simply that the second and third angels followed the first in point of\r\ntime, but that they went with him. The three messages are but one\r\nthreefold message. They are _three_ only in the order of their rise. But\r\nhaving risen, they go on together, and are inseparable.\r\n\r\nPage 447.
