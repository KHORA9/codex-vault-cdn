I had a chum.\r\nWhat boy has not? My chum’s name was Bill. He had been absent from New\r\nBedford for a few months, and on meeting him, a few days after his\r\nreturn, I greeted him with:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “HELLO, BILL!”]\r\n\r\n“Hello, Bill! Have you heard the news?”\r\n\r\n“No; what is it?”\r\n\r\n“Well; while you were away, the news came that a man in California,\r\nnamed Marshall, has made the discovery that there’s lots of GOLD out\r\nthere. He found a big chunk of it where he was at work.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t say so! What’s he going to do with it; did he say?”\r\n\r\n“That has nothing to do with the case. There’s the greatest excitement\r\nhere, you ever heard of. Not only here, but all over the country, on\r\naccount of the discovery. Thousands of men are getting ready to go out\r\nthere. A lot of ships down at the wharves are being fitted out for the\r\nvoyage, and they are going to take passengers cheap. Now what do you\r\nsay to going along?”\r\n\r\nBill did not seem to enthuse nearly as much as the occasion would\r\nwarrant, for said he,\r\n\r\n“Well, now; I don’t see what reasons you can give for supposing that\r\nthere’s more gold there, simply because this man found a chunk of it.”\r\n\r\n“But, Bill,” said I, with undampened ardor; “don’t you understand the\r\nscientific nature of it? Isn’t it likely that there must be lots more\r\nof it scattered about? Besides, the volcanic character of the country\r\nis very favorable for that kind of a product, you know.”\r\n\r\nBill smiled skeptically, and gave me the benefit of his geological\r\nknowledge as follows:\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, I know. The gold is thrown out from the bowels of the earth,\r\nwhere it’s manufactured, by the volcanoes and scattered about on the\r\ntops of the mountains. Then along come the earthquakes and shake it\r\ndown among the grass roots and bushes in the valleys, where you expect\r\nto scrape it up by the bushel.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, it may prove to be, as you say, a wild goose chase, after\r\nall; but there’s a ship, now at the wharf, right from San Francisco,\r\nand one of the sailors, who seems to be a real honest chap, told me\r\nthat the country was chock full of gold. He said that after they had\r\nhoisted up the anchor to start home he scraped the mud off the anchor\r\nand washed more than five pounds out of it--”\r\n\r\n“Of what--mud?”\r\n\r\n“No, of GOLD; REAL GOLD!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, pshaw! Do you believe that yarn?”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course I do! Sailors are noted for their veracity.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing of the kind. They have the reputation of being the biggest\r\nliars on earth; especially when out on the water and the wind blows\r\nhard.”\r\n\r\nStill true to my colors, I protested, “That’s impossible.”\r\n\r\n“No, ’tis not, for if you were sailing a ship out at sea and the wind\r\nblew real hard, you’d lie too.”\r\n\r\nBill’s levity fell upon unappreciative soil. I was too much in earnest,\r\nand resumed:\r\n\r\n“I’m bound to go out there, Bill, if I don’t pick more than a hatful of\r\ngold in a day. There’s nothing like trying, you know. But what’s the\r\nuse of going after gold, you say? Well, now, isn’t that what we are all\r\nafter, and nearly crazy to get? And, isn’t it easier to go to a country\r\nwhere you can scrape it up from the ground or pick it out from among\r\nthe grass by the bucketful, than it is to toil and sweat and worry\r\nthrough a long life here?”\r\n\r\nI cannot now remember whether Bill was just a little cynical, or simply\r\nechoed the opinions of some of the wiseacres of that day when he\r\nparried my query with,\r\n\r\n“There’s plenty of money in the country now, and more is unnecessary.\r\nWhat are you going to do with it all?”\r\n\r\n“That’s a singular idea,” I answered. “Do you suppose it’s possible to\r\nhave too much money in the country? Such old, puritanical notions about\r\nmoney are ridiculous. You and I haven’t too much and we could use a\r\nfew millions to good advantage, if we had them. And if it should prove\r\ntrue that lots of gold can be found in California, you’ll live to see\r\nthis country step to the front among nations in wealth, prosperity and\r\nenterprise.”\r\n\r\nIn my ardor I had risen to unwonted heights of eloquence.\r\n\r\nBill thought that there was enough enterprise in the country, already.\r\n\r\nI assured him that when we began to send gold back from California in\r\nton lots, the various enterprises would boom to an extent never before\r\nwitnessed in the world.\r\n\r\nBill had, however, taken the negative side of the issue and fired\r\nanother broadside at me:\r\n\r\n“Yes, but Jo, aren’t you going it a little too fast in anticipating\r\nsuch big things? For my part, I don’t believe that there’s enough gold\r\nin all of California to do all that. ’Twould take bushels of it, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\nUpon confirmation of the news of the discovery of gold in California,\r\nall was commotion in the various seaports of the Atlantic coast.\r\nVessels of all sizes and descriptions, from the small, 50 ton fishing\r\nsmack, that would be compelled to crawl along near the shore, up to\r\nthe noble clipper ship, that was able to contend with the elements\r\nin mid-ocean, were fitted up with conveniences for passengers in\r\ngreatest haste. Many vessels sailed early in the year of ’49 for the\r\nEldorado. It was not, however, until the spring that the grand stampede\r\ncommenced. By April 1, in ’49, 50,000 good, able-bodied men, and a few\r\nwomen, all desirous of bettering their condition and acquiring wealth\r\nin a much easier and quicker method than by the old-fashioned, slow and\r\nplodding methods of their ancestors, were upon their way to the other\r\nside of the continent, willing to encounter the danger from Indians\r\nor starvation, whilst an equal number preferred to risk the dangers\r\nof a journey by sea to the land of gold. In company with about one\r\nhundred others, we took passage in the clipper ship “America,” Capt.\r\nC. P. Seabury, from the port of New Bedford, Mass. On the morning of\r\nthe 1st of April, the fact was announced that all must be on board at\r\n10 A.M. The anchor was raised from its muddy bed below;\r\nthe sails were unfurled to the breeze; the bow of our boat swung round\r\na bit and pointed out toward the billows in the big ocean beyond. We\r\nbade farewell to friends who accompanied us out to the light-house;\r\nand, with hearty wishes from them that we might meet with the greatest\r\nsuccess in our venturesome undertaking, sailed out upon the broad ocean\r\nin the direction of Cape Horn. We watched the green hills, with which\r\nwe had been familiar from early childhood, as they vanished from sight\r\nbelow the horizon, and wondered then if ’twas so ordained by the powers\r\nabove, that we would soon be enabled to return again to these familiar\r\nscenes of our boyhood days with our pockets lined with tin (and some of\r\nus still continue in the same business, at the old stand, of wondering).\r\n\r\nOur passengers, being unaccustomed to the situation, soon felt very\r\npeculiar sensations produced by the motions of the vessel. We sought\r\nthe entrance to the basement, into which we managed to make our way in\r\nan oblique kind of a style, and retired to our sleeping apartments,\r\nthere to remain until we deemed it safe to again climb out upon the\r\nroof of the vessel.\r\n\r\nWe were satisfied in a few days that we were very fortunate in our\r\nselection of a vessel for the voyage, for we found that she was a\r\nstrong, staunch one; a fast goer, with a good crew and commanded by an\r\nexpert seaman, who understood his business. Fortunately for\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE START.]\r\n\r\nus, perhaps, we had as passengers a number of old veteran (retired) sea\r\ncaptains, who were always very ready and willing, without remuneration,\r\nto give our captain all necessary advice, at such times when, in their\r\nopinion, he needed it. When, in their opinion, there was danger of\r\nthe ship sailing too fast, they would advise him to take down some\r\nof the big sails; or, again, when the wind was too high, they would\r\nbecome aware at once of the danger of the ship running under, front end\r\nforemost, and at such times they would advise the captain to stop her.\r\nUnder such conditions, where there were many men of experience keeping\r\ntheir weather eyes open for emergencies, it is evident that we, the\r\npassengers, felt perfectly secure from danger, and could sleep without\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nDuring the voyage we amused ourselves, no doubt, in the same manner\r\nas passengers of vessels usually do, by various games. There were an\r\nassortment of musical instruments, and card playing was an amusement\r\nmuch in vogue; but a few of the younger passengers of a sporting\r\ntendency, would bet upon the speed of the ship and the number of miles\r\nwe would sail upon the succeeding day. Some of the older ones, however,\r\nof a more elevated character, who were above such petty amusements,\r\nwould practice at leap-frog upon deck during pleasant weather. When\r\nthe weather was otherwise they would pass their time below, in betting\r\nwith each other upon the number of plums they would be able to find\r\nin their respective rations of duff, and many were enabled to enjoy\r\ndouble rations at the table in consequence. In the opinion of many of\r\nthe older passengers, one very important fact had been overlooked in\r\nour great haste to start for the golden shores of California, and that\r\nwas, the failure to make suitable provision for the storage of gold\r\ndust. This was, indeed, an oversight, for nothing had been provided\r\nsuitable for the purpose. It therefore taxed the ingenuity of the\r\nolder ones, and many were the devices proposed. One very ingenious and\r\nsanguine individual commenced the manufacture of leather pouches from\r\nold boot-legs or from pieces of canvas, maintaining that these would be\r\nfound the most convenient. Another insisted that good, strong, stone\r\nale bottles were far superior for stowing the finer grades of dust,\r\nand such was his faith in them that he had actually brought two or\r\nthree dozen with him. But where is the limit to genius or the faculty\r\nof adaptation to conditions, for if no other person had appeared upon\r\nthe stage with a superior device for the purpose, the inventors of the\r\nboot-leg pouch and of the ale bottle devices would have divided the\r\nhonors between them for their ingenuity. The possession of an older\r\nhead with greater experience, however, suggested that although leather\r\npouches and beer bottles might answer very well, they would probably\r\nbe found very inconvenient to handle on account of the great specific\r\ngravity of gold. He therefore suggested that the best way to pack the\r\ngold dust, and the best means of handling it, would be to put it into\r\nempty pork barrels, for these could be rolled with ease and of course\r\nwould be more convenient for shipping. The greater portion of the\r\npassengers saw at once the superior advantages of the pork-barrel idea,\r\nand resolved to adopt that method.\r\n\r\nOne old gentleman spent his time in the construction of a dredging\r\nmachine for raising the sand from the river beds, and for extracting\r\nthe big nuggets from among the rocks at the bottom; whilst another\r\none busied himself in making sheet-iron scoops, to which long poles\r\nwere to be attached. His idea was to take his station under the shade\r\nof a tree, upon the river bank, scoop up the rich golden sands and\r\nextract the gold from it upon dry land, without the danger of being sun\r\nstruck or wetting his feet. Many of the more intelligent ones among\r\nour passengers kept a daily record of scenes and incidents during our\r\nvoyage; but so much of this class of literature has been heretofore\r\nbrought before the public that a report from any of them would not be\r\nof much interest at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nARRIVAL AT ST. CATHERINA--AMERICAN PLUCK--THE FOUR BRAVE TOURISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt having been decided by the Captain of our vessel, at the request\r\nof many of the passengers, that we visit some port upon the coast of\r\nBrazil, upon consulting the sailing directions of Lieut. Maury, it was\r\nfound that in order to do so it was necessary to first visit the coast\r\nof Africa, to take advantage of the trade winds. The ship’s course was\r\ntherefore directed towards the Continent of Africa, at which portion\r\nof our planet we arrived in good time; and ’twas not until we found\r\nthat the dust from that continent was accumulating upon our clothing\r\nand other articles on ship board, that our Captain concluded we were\r\nnear enough to the African coast. Our good ship was, therefore, turned\r\naround and the bow pointed towards South America. With a fair wind we\r\ncrossed the ocean again, and on the 20th of May sailed into the port of\r\nSt. Catherina and dropped anchor under the guns of the fortification\r\nlocated on the summit of a hill near the town.\r\n\r\nWe found lying at anchor here the steamer “Senator,” on her way\r\nto California, as well as two or three other vessels loaded with\r\npassengers from the United States for the same destination. An incident\r\nin which the passengers of these vessels took a very prominent part\r\noccurred a few days previous to our arrival, and is worth relating, as\r\nit illustrates the type of American character which constituted the\r\nadvance guard of the California pioneers, and proves that the Americans\r\nwill submit to no indignity from a foreign race, if they possess the\r\npower and means of resenting it.\r\n\r\nA young man, a passenger of one of the vessels, was assassinated by\r\na native, but for what reason was not known, although supposed to be\r\nfrom jealousy. The Americans demanded the arrest and punishment of\r\nthe assassin, but no attention was paid to the demand, and no efforts\r\nwere made for the murderer’s arrest, since he had slain only an\r\n“Americano.” It may be of some interest to those of the human family\r\nwho have adopted the great American Eagle as their emblem, to know\r\nthat at this period in their history--40 years ago--when iron clads\r\nwere unthought of and monitors unknown, this nation of people were not\r\nheld in very high esteem by the various governments and peoples of the\r\nSouth American continent, for the reason that their ports were but\r\nvery seldom visited by our ships of war, only upon certain isolated\r\noccasions, when the American sloop of war “St. Marys,” or some craft\r\nof similar dimensions, would put into these Southern ports. For this\r\nreason, they seemed to be impressed with the idea that, in comparison\r\nwith England, with the monster ships of war with which they were all\r\nfamiliar, the United States were of little consequence and small\r\npotatoes generally. As a consequence, a demand for the arrest for the\r\nmurderer of the young American was treated with contempt; but they were\r\ndealing now with the passengers of three or four ships who were on\r\ntheir way to California--a crowd of Americans who were determined to\r\nhave the culprit arrested and punished at all hazards. The Governor of\r\nthe province, beginning to be alarmed by their demonstrations, for they\r\nhad threatened to capture the fortress upon the hill and to bombard the\r\ntown, despatched messengers instantly to the Emperor at Rio Janeiro for\r\nassistance, believing, no doubt, that it was the intention of these\r\nvile “Americanos” to capture the entire country and annex it to the\r\nUnited States. This idea arose from the fact, as we heard related,\r\nthat the passengers from one ship did actually enter the fortress and\r\nunfolded to the breeze the stars and stripes from the flag-staff, and\r\nsome one, for fun or accident, had with a piece of charcoal put in an\r\nadditional star which, of course, represented Brazil. But peace was\r\nsoon restored; the Governor had the culprit arrested, and after a fair\r\ntrial he was shot in the presence of those who demanded his execution;\r\nand in a few days the ships sailed upon their course for California\r\nwith passengers satisfied and contented.\r\n\r\nWe found, a short distance in the interior, a man with his family\r\nfrom the State of Vermont, who had emigrated here to live in ease and\r\ncomfort upon the spontaneous productions of the soil, which consist of\r\noranges, bananas and other tropical fruits. He stated that he had been\r\ninduced to make his home in this tropical country by an acquaintance\r\nwho was a seafaring man, and had often visited this portion of the\r\nearth. Through representations of the beauty of the country and the\r\nlittle labor and exertion required to live in ease and comfort, he had\r\nbeen persuaded into coming here.\r\n\r\n“The first year was pleasant indeed,” said he; “and often when we were\r\nconversing upon the pleasures of such a life free from toil and care,\r\nwe wondered why the greater portion of those who dwelt in the far\r\nnorthern New England States, amidst the snows and rains of their severe\r\nwinters, toiling and striving for the necessaries of life, did not come\r\nto this earthly paradise. These were our thoughts and feelings during\r\nthe first year; but, after a residence of three years in this beautiful\r\ncountry, with its warm sunny skies and its luxuriant vegetation,\r\ndespite these advantages, we have been forced to the conclusion that,\r\nalthough the natives of the country were adapted by nature to such\r\nconditions of existence, an American never would be. Why, sir, I can\r\ntake more solid enjoyment and comfort in one year among the rugged\r\nhills and rocks of old Vermont, where the maxim is work or starve, than\r\nit would be possible to find here in a lifetime, and I intend returning\r\nto that country again just as soon as opportunity offers.”\r\n\r\nIt was here at St. Catherina, also, that we saw for the first time in\r\nour lives diamonds in their rough state when taken from the river beds,\r\nand which, to all appearances, are ordinary quartz pebbles, such as\r\nare often seen upon the sea-shore. In their original state when first\r\nformed in nature’s subterranean laboratory, they are crystallized with\r\nproper facets and angles; but being subsequently deposited in the beds\r\nof running streams, in process of time are worn to a smooth surface by\r\nfriction amongst the gravel of the river. These gems possess but little\r\nvalue until much time and considerable labor is expended in again\r\nrestoring the worn out facets and angles. So far as known they serve\r\nbut one purpose in their rough state, and that is to illustrate the\r\nfact that although a man may be very careless in his style of dress,\r\npaying no regard to the latest fashion and even with his top-coat in\r\nrags, yet he may be a real nice sort of a man for all that; a gem of\r\nthe first water beneath a rough coating. Experience illustrates the\r\nfact that this is often the case, and for this reason it would be as\r\nwell before driving the tramp from out the back yard to search beneath\r\nhis rags for the gem that may possibly be there, or for anything else\r\nof value that may be concealed.\r\n\r\nWe saw, also, a specimen of the diamond miner, a few of them having\r\njust arrived from the mines, hundreds of miles away to the West, in\r\nthe interior, to dispose of the diamonds to the merchants in the town.\r\nOne of them explained to us the manner of finding the valuable gem:\r\nthe process being similar, in some respects, to the methods adopted in\r\nCalifornia in mining for gold in the river-beds. By the use of wing\r\ndams, the stream is turned, and, after shovelling the sand and gravel\r\nfrom the bed rock, search is then made for what are termed pot holes\r\nin the hard bed rock, in the bottom of which is found the diamond, or\r\nat least it should be there, but unfortunately this is not always the\r\ncase, as all miners can testify to with sorrow.\r\n\r\nA few miles inland was the border of the great Brazilian forest that\r\nwe had often read of in our school-boy days, and which, at this point,\r\napproaches to within a few miles of the coast. We were informed that\r\na few miles within this dark forest could be found a small lake about\r\ntwo miles in circumference, and that it was filled with a great variety\r\nof creeping ferocious reptiles, such as alligators, crocodiles, huge\r\nwater snakes and water lizards. Upon its surface, also could be seen\r\nwater fowl of all kinds, and upon the branches of trees surrounding\r\nit a great variety of birds, with the gayest plumage, could be found.\r\nFrolicking amidst the tall grass upon its banks would be seen a variety\r\nof wild animals, including beautiful specimens of the frolicsome\r\nBrazilian tiger. A number of us determined to enter this dense\r\nforest and investigate the beauties of this wonderful lake and its\r\nsurroundings; but we were warned by the natives that it was a dangerous\r\nundertaking, unless we procured a suitable guide, as it was very dark\r\nand dismal within the forest; and furthermore, that the trails formed\r\nby the animals were so tortuous and crooked, that there was danger of\r\ngetting lost. To our inexperienced minds, an undertaking of this nature\r\noffered irresistible fascinations, for we were of a nation that knew\r\nno fear, and the national characteristic being to satisfy curiosity,\r\nlet the consequences be what they may, why should we fear? Were we not\r\narmed with the latest discovery that the inventive genius of a Yankee\r\ncould devise as a protection? Perhaps the animals in the forest had\r\nnot, as yet, been made aware of the fact; but would they not crouch in\r\nabject fear when we entered the dark trails of the vast forest to see\r\neach of us carrying in his hand a Smith & Wesson, duplex patent, double\r\nback action, revolver, vulgarly styled a “pepper-box”? Well, I should\r\nsay they would, and so we thought. Armed with this style of weapon,\r\none pleasant morning four of us (the bravest ones) determined to enter\r\nthe forest and beard the tiger in his lair. A native kindly volunteered\r\nto leave his daily toil, and, for a small fee, guide us to the entrance\r\nof the forest. We examined our weapons, drew a long breath, and in\r\nsingle file, walked in the narrow trail for a short distance into the\r\ndark abyss: then stopped, drew another long breath, and marched out\r\nagain. Not because we had any fear for our individual selves, but for\r\neach other, for each didn’t like to see the other torn into a mass of\r\nshoe strings by an enraged tiger.\r\n\r\n“What was that awful roaring away in there, do you reckon?” asked one.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” says another. “That noise was miles away. I ain’t afraid, so\r\nlet’s try it again.”\r\n\r\nAfter discharging a few shots at imaginary beasts, as a fair warning\r\nto others away in the forest that were not imaginary, we again entered\r\nthe dark trail and proceeded cautiously onward. The monkeys among the\r\nbranches over our heads would follow us, and occasionally approach near\r\nenough to endeavor to snatch our hats from our heads. We had proceeded\r\nin this manner for about a mile, when a Cape Cod chap, who was in the\r\nvan, suddenly came to a stop, at the same time exclaiming in a very\r\nemphatic manner, “Go back! go back, quick!” We all pressed forward,\r\nhowever, anxious to see the cause of the alarm, and we saw it. A few\r\nstraggling rays of the sun had forced their way through the thick\r\nfoliage above, and illuminated a small patch of the trail of about\r\ntwo feet in extent, and lying in this sunny spot could be discerned\r\nthe head of an enormous serpent. The body was there too, of course,\r\nbut being among the bushes it was not visible. We cared nothing for\r\nthe body, but it was the ferocious looking head that startled us. Its\r\neyes assumed all the colors of the rainbow. Four pairs of very severe\r\neyes were concentrated upon the eyes of the monster, which seemed to\r\nrealize the situation, and from a feeling of bashfulness at being gazed\r\nupon by strangers, or, perhaps, having caught sight of our weapons,\r\nand recognized the brand, from an instinct of coming danger closed its\r\neyes. With optics partially closed, its countenance assumed a very\r\namiable expression; but a slight movement from one of us caused it to\r\nagain raise its eyes, and made one, at least, of us wish that he hadn’t\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n“Oh pshaw!” remarked a Boston chap, who had attended high school some,\r\n“let’s go ahead anyhow. You remember that Plato, or some other fellow,\r\nsaid that courage was one of the virtues, or something of the kind. Now\r\nlet us prove that we are virtuous young men. We will turn his right\r\nflank, and get to his rear easy enough.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, git out,” said the Cape Cod chap; “them form of animals hain’t\r\ngot any right nor left flank at all; nor rear end neither, ’cause\r\ntheir bodies come to a point on the fur end.” Just at this moment,\r\nthe monster made a forward movement and we retired in a rather hasty\r\nmanner, leaving the serpent to enjoy its sun bath.\r\n\r\nBut the reader would ask, since we were so well provided with weapons,\r\nwhy in the name of Cæsar didn’t we massacre the brute at once, and go\r\non. It must have been from fear that we did not, and so it was. We were\r\nfearful of shooting each other, for we had practiced so little with our\r\nweapons that it had not as yet been positively decided whether or not\r\nwe should aim right at an animal that we desired to massacre, or in the\r\nopposite direction. One of the young men who had practiced considerably\r\nduring the voyage shooting at the big waves, and was always positive\r\nthat he hit them, somewhere, volunteered to test his skill upon the\r\nserpent, but for fear that the noise might make it angry and cause it\r\nto bite some of us, he was prevented.\r\n\r\nAs we emerged from the forest, our ears were assailed with a most\r\nunearthly screeching, that seemed to come from the open country beyond\r\nthe forest. We concluded, at once, that some ferocious monster had by\r\naccident got out of the woods, and was unable to find its way back\r\nagain. We examined our weapons, determined to sell our lives at the\r\nhighest price, spot cash, and marched manfully in the direction of our\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nThe Cape Cod lad remarked, as we hurried onward, that the screeching\r\nreminded him of a political caucus in his native town, and “the\r\ncheerman was a-tryin’ to call ther meetin’ to order.” Upon reaching\r\na slight elevation, we saw, in the road ahead of us, a cart drawn by\r\na pair of oxen, and it was from this that the noise proceeded. We\r\nconcluded, at once, that the cart contained wild animals that were\r\nperhaps being shipped to New York for Mr. Barnum; but upon nearer\r\napproach we found, to our astonishment and disgust, that the terrible\r\nBrazilian melody was caused by the wheels upon the axles, which in this\r\ncountry are never greased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MUSICAL OX-CART.]\r\n\r\nWe suggested to the driver, by certain signs, that they ought to be\r\ngreased, and that it was an evidence of barbarism, and would not be\r\ntolerated in any civilized country. “Oh no,” he replied, “Americanos no\r\nsabe. Wheels no sing: bullocks no go.”\r\n\r\nWell, ’tis no wonder they go; anything would go from such a noise, and\r\nnever return. An army of Kansas grasshoppers would go into the regions\r\nabove and never again return to earth. The terrible screeching was\r\nheard also on board of the ship, and it even suggested to our Captain\r\nthat we ought to go too, and that ten days was long enough to remain in\r\nany country where they didn’t grease their cart wheels, and we went.\r\nAfter taking on board a good supply of tropical fruits of various\r\nkinds, with bananas in greatest abundance, which were suspended to the\r\nship’s rigging in all convenient places until she had the appearance\r\nof a banana plantation going on an excursion, we sailed again out upon\r\nthe broad ocean and laid our course for Cape Horn, where we expected to\r\narrive by the middle of June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nA GALE--THE OCEAN SWELL--CAPE HORN--THE MAGELLAN CLOUD--THE NATIVE\r\nTRADITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs is very often the case in relation to human affairs, fate decreed\r\notherwise, and in plain, unmistakable language we heard whispered by\r\nthe gale which we encountered as it roared through the ship’s rigging,\r\n“Go slow! go slow!” And we did. About three hundred miles from the\r\nland off the mouth of the La Platte we encountered what all of the old\r\nsalts, as well as the young, fresh ones, declared to be the heaviest\r\ngale that it was ever our misfortune to encounter. It came from off\r\nthe coast, and of course was favorable for us; but there was a little\r\ntoo much of it. The sea was smooth, for such was the velocity and\r\nforce of the gale that when a billow attempted to assert its rights\r\nand raised its head above the general sea level, it was instantly\r\nblown off, leaving in its place but a mass of white and seething foam.\r\nIn this manner, with our noble ship lying to with the lee rail under\r\nwater, we remained for thirteen days. To cook was impossible, for the\r\nreason that, at the angle at which our galley stove cut the horizon,\r\nnothing would stay in the dinner pot, and we were obliged therefore to\r\neat off-hand and at random whatever we could get. It was now getting\r\nmonotonous, and to add to our troubles the Captain would not grant us\r\npermission to go on shore, and it even seemed to hurt his feelings when\r\nwe asked him.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the thirteenth, the Captain, deprived of his\r\naccustomed rations of plum duff and soft tack, determined upon the\r\ntactics which he should adopt the following day if the gale did not\r\nabate and that was to run before the gale. This course was strongly\r\nobjected to by the veteran skippers on board, who claimed that it would\r\nbe a most dangerous proceeding and would never be adopted by anyone\r\nbut a young and inexperienced commander. They had, as they explained,\r\nroamed the seas over from infancy and were well aware of the danger\r\nof running before a gale of such huge dimensions as we were then\r\nexperiencing. They therefore strongly protested against it and assured\r\nthe Captain that in case he did adopt that plan he must be responsible\r\nfor all damages if the ship should run under and sink away down to the\r\nbottom in the cold sea, which they were most positive would be the case.\r\n\r\nThe Captain, however, after lying all night on the edge of his bunk\r\ndetermined, notwithstanding their protestations, early the next morning\r\nto make a break for liberty. With a firm step and with salt water in\r\nhis larboard eye, he ascended to the deck and soon the command was\r\nheard above the roar of the tempest: “All hands on deck!”\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes every man of us was at his post as soon as we could\r\nfind it, and when the order was given to the sailors who were holding\r\nfast to the wheel to let her go, they did, and it flew around in a most\r\nspiteful manner, as if conscious of its freedom. The bows of the ship\r\nswung around with the gale and we went flying amidst the foam upon the\r\nrough surface of the sea at a rate of speed nearly equal to a railroad\r\ntrain, and in a few hours were again upon our way with a fair wind and\r\nunder full sail in the direction of Cape Horn.\r\n\r\n“Well, well!” exclaimed one of the veteran skippers, who had predicted\r\nall kinds of disasters to the inexperienced Captain, as a consequence\r\nof his rash proceeding, and who was now standing near the gangway\r\nholding in his hand a well-filled carpet-bag, and with a look of\r\ndisgust and disappointment in his expectations stamped upon his\r\nweather-beaten countenance: “Yer come outer that gale in good seaman\r\nstyle; but if yer had only took my advice yer’d done it more ’n a week\r\nago.”\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Cape Horn on the 4th of July, and with a fair wind sailed\r\naround the dangerous point and entered the waters of the Pacific\r\nOcean. This being our national holiday, we dressed up our vessel in\r\nappropriate attire, and with various instruments of music, the firing\r\nof guns and pistols, celebrated the day in true Yankee style, to the\r\ngreat astonishment of the seagulls, as well as the immense flock of\r\nbirds of various kinds that arose into the air from the clefts and\r\ncaverns of the massive rocks of the coast.\r\n\r\nJust previous to our arrival at Cape Horn, much surprise had been\r\nexpressed by many of us at the unusual heavy swell of the sea or of the\r\nhuge billows we encountered, but had been invariably reminded by the\r\naged veteran seaman on board:\r\n\r\n“Oh, pshaw! these are nothing but ripples compared to what you will see\r\nwhen you reach Cape Horn. You just wait, and blast me eyes, but you\r\nwill see them down there as high as the main mast.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CAPE HORN SWELL.]\r\n\r\nThe consequence was that we waited. We now turned our attention to the\r\nheavy swells for which we had patiently waited, and found them nearly\r\nas represented, for they were immense, and to take a view of them from\r\nthe cabin window at the stern of the ship required considerable nerve,\r\nas it really seemed, when the stern was away down in the trough between\r\nthe great rollers, that nothing short of a miracle could raise the ship\r\nquick enough to prevent the hugh billows from rolling over her. We\r\nfound, however, upon experimenting with a long rope on deck, by shaking\r\nit up and down from one end, that in a similar manner the great billows\r\ndo not move forward upon the surface of the ocean, as they have every\r\nappearance of doing, to the utter destruction of every object which\r\nthey come into contact with, but that they simply rise and fall. It is\r\nthis continual rise and fall of the water on the surface of the ocean\r\nthat gives it the appearance of rolling onward in the form of huge\r\nbillows.\r\n\r\nThe traditions of the native Patagonians tell us that centuries ago\r\na race of giants existed upon the extreme end of the South American\r\ncontinent; but whether that was their place of residence, or that they\r\nwere there only upon a picnic excursion, is not definitely known.\r\nIt unfortunately happened, however, that while there this great\r\nconvulsion occurred, which separated the extreme end of the continent\r\nfrom the main land; and to their great astonishment, when aroused\r\nfrom their slumbers early one morning, they found themselves situated\r\nupon a high commanding eminence, at a distance from the main land,\r\nand entirely surrounded by water. To wade through the cold Southern\r\nsea to the main land again was out of the question, for they had come\r\ntotally unprepared for such an emergency, having left their rubber\r\nboots at home. They were, however, giants, and knew their strength.\r\nBreaking the high mountain upon which they stood into fragments of\r\nsuitable size they hurled them into the sea beyond, and using them\r\nfor stepping-stones, regained the said continent without accident, or\r\nwetting a single foot. This is said to be the origin of those extreme\r\nSouthern islands which they named Terra del Fuego.\r\n\r\nThe end of the continent was by this convulsion broken apart, and\r\nthrough this break the waters of the oceans found their way, forming\r\na very convenient channel for small vessels to avoid the dangers of\r\nthe Cape in passing from one ocean to the other. This channel was\r\ndiscovered by Magellan.\r\n\r\nTo the extreme southern point of the solid islands of rocks is given\r\nthe name Cape Horn, around which it is difficult and dangerous to pass\r\nin consequence of the prevailing winds, which blow almost constantly\r\nfrom the west. It is at this point, also, that a good view is had of\r\nwhat is called the Magellan Cloud, not so named because Mr. Magellan\r\nfirst discovered it, but from the fact that the strait which he did\r\ndiscover, whether by accident or otherwise, is located immediately\r\nbeneath it. At night, this cloud has the appearance of a mass of\r\nluminous vapor floating in space above, and such is its immense\r\ndistance from our planet, that no telescope has as yet been constructed\r\nwith power sufficient to enable our astronomers to determine its\r\ntrue character; or whether it is, as it appears, a mass of luminous\r\nvapor, or a cluster of celestial bodies like our own universe. Now,\r\nis it not possible that this is another universe similar to our own,\r\nlocated in distant space, and in company with thousands of other\r\nsimilar collections of celestial bodies which are scattered throughout\r\ninfinite space, all moving in one general direction, and governed and\r\ncontrolled by the same ruling power? This is possible, and that each\r\nuniverse is separate and distinct from all others there is no doubt,\r\nand that to those who are dwelling upon the various planets of which\r\nthey are composed, our own universe presents a similar appearance is\r\nvery probable. In viewing these distant collections of celestial bodies\r\nin the firmament above, they may be very properly compared to swarms of\r\ngnats which we often witness sporting in the sunshine.\r\n\r\nWith a fair wind, we laid our course for the port of Callao, in Peru.\r\nA few days followed of fair wind which seemed to increase in violence\r\nas we proceeded, until it had assumed the proportions of a very\r\nrespectable gale, termed in Nevada a “gentle zephyr.” It was during the\r\ncontinuance of this gale that a little incident occurred which may not\r\nbe of much interest to seafaring men, and one of ordinary occurrence;\r\nbut to those who do not go down upon the sea in ships it may be of\r\nsome interest, since it illustrates the nature and character of the\r\nrequisites of an able seaman and commander. During the gale, a block or\r\nshieve upon the end of the main yard was torn from its lashings, and\r\nfell upon the deck. The ship was luffed up into the wind: the great\r\nseas broke over the bows, and the mainsail threshed about in a terrible\r\nmanner in its frantic efforts to free itself from its lashings, and\r\nto keep company with the gale. It was absolutely necessary that that\r\nblock should again be placed and securely lashed upon the end of the\r\nyard, of which fact all the officers of the ship were well aware; but\r\nwhere was the sailor who had the courage to go out upon the end of\r\nthat yard, when, as the ship rolled, the extreme end where the block\r\nwas to be lashed was out of sight, became buried in the white foam of\r\nthe huge billows? The Captain ordered no one to perform the dangerous\r\nduty, but asked the first mate, who was holding fast upon the rigging\r\nnear, if any man would volunteer to do it? The mate, who was naturally\r\nof a modest and quiet disposition, raised his eyes aloft to the yard,\r\nthen to the surging billows below, thought of his loved ones at home,\r\nand very modestly declined, with thanks. The second mate, a big, burly\r\nseaman, turned his port eye toward the chief mate, concluded that he\r\nhad a level head, and concurred for similar reasons. Our Captain,\r\nfinding that no one on board of the ship was willing to perform the\r\ndangerous duty, remarked that he should then be compelled to do it\r\nhimself. Taking the huge block, slung to his shoulder, he mounted aloft\r\nout upon the yard, where he succeeded in lashing it securely in its\r\nplace, although not without a great deal of trouble and danger. The\r\nship swung off again before the gale, and all danger was past.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ABLE COMMANDER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nARRIVAL IN CALLAO--THE RELICS OF THE EARTHQUAKE--THE FROLIC WITH THE\r\nENGLISH OFFICERS--TARGET SHOOTING--THE CALM--WATER SPOUTS--THE SHARK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ship’s course was now directed towards the port of Callao, Peru,\r\nwhere we arrived about the 10th of August. We remained in this port\r\nabout eight days, visiting in the meantime the beautiful city of Lima\r\nlocated at the foot of the mountains, a few miles inland, and a portion\r\nof the earth where a rain-storm is unknown.\r\n\r\nWe found that the chief and principal amusements here at this time\r\nconsisted in cock and bull fighting; the grand arena, with its gorgeous\r\ntrappings, being situated adjacent to and under the shadow of the\r\nprincipal cathedral of the city.\r\n\r\nIn the town of Callao we saw the ruins of the old city which was\r\npartially submerged by an earthquake in 1765, at which time a ship\r\nbeing at anchor in the harbor was carried by the returning tidal wave\r\nabout five miles inland, where the old hull was deposited and could be\r\nplainly seen. At ebb tide, the tiled roofs of many old buildings can\r\nyet be seen upon the sandy beach; but the greater portion, however,\r\nof the submerged town lies in deep water, above which vessels in the\r\nharbor ride at anchor.\r\n\r\nA little incident which occurred here in the city of Lima upon the\r\nday previous to our arrival, as we heard related is perhaps worth\r\nrecording. Upon our arrival in the port of Callao, we found lying at\r\nanchor there, the U. S. sloop of war “St. Mary,” as well as the English\r\nman-of-war “Asia,” and an English sloop of war, the name of which I\r\nhave forgotten. There was also in port a ship from Norfolk, Va., having\r\non board as passengers about forty young men from Richmond and other\r\nSouthern cities on their way to California. There was a feeling of\r\njealousy existing among the English officers and these young Southern\r\nbloods in the city of Lima, from the fact that the latter seemed to\r\nattract more attention\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ARGONAUTS AT LIMA.]\r\n\r\nfrom the ladies of Castilian blood. The English officers were\r\ndetermined to revenge themselves, and they endeavored to do it, and to\r\nfurther show their contempt for Americans generally in a despicable\r\nmanner. The latter, upon one occasion, concluded to have a regular\r\nchampagne dinner, and engaged for the purpose the large dining-room\r\nof the only American hotel in the city, which they arranged to occupy\r\nat 2 P.M. of the day appointed. The English officers,\r\nto the number of thirty, having been informed of the intention of the\r\nAmericans, found now their opportunity for revenge by taking possession\r\nof the dining-room at the appointed time, and locking the doors, thus\r\ninterfering with the arrangements. Unfortunately for them, however,\r\nthey had never fully understood the real nature of American pluck, as\r\none of the English officers was afterwards ready and willing to admit.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time the Americans met at the hotel, but only to\r\nfind the doors to the dining-room locked and the room occupied by the\r\nEnglish officers. After a short consultation, a tall, fine-looking\r\nspecimen of one of the F. F. V’s knocked upon the door, demanding\r\ninstant admission, but, of course, was refused. Two minutes was then\r\nallowed, and in case of refusal they were informed that the door\r\nwould be broken in. “Do so, at your peril,” came from the inside;\r\nand almost instantly the door went in with a crash, and the tall\r\nVirginian, stepping inside to the head of the table, seized a bottle\r\nof wine and threw it with full force, striking the center of the table\r\nbeyond, and bounding to the wall upon the opposite end of the room.\r\nAt the same time, thirty or forty Americans, well prepared, filed in\r\nand took their stations behind the English officers, who leaped to\r\ntheir feet, and with their short swords flourishing above their heads\r\ndemanded instant satisfaction for the insult. They were informed by\r\nthe leader of the opposite party that it was the latter who demanded\r\nsatisfaction, and that the former must instantly leave the room, or\r\nthe Americans would enforce the demand. After some loud talking and\r\nthreats from the leaders of both sides had been indulged in, a more\r\nquiet and subdued tone was used; mutual explanations followed; suitable\r\napologies were given, and a general hand-shaking followed. Swords were\r\nsheathed, and fortunately the danger of a conflict was averted; seats,\r\nas well as an additional supply of champagne and other refreshments,\r\nwere ordered. The Americans were very cordially invited to partake of\r\nthe festivities, which invitation they accepted, and peace and harmony\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\nOne effect of this incident, was a greater respect for the American\r\npeople, or at least that portion of them who were at present in the\r\nharbor of Callao; for, upon the day following the incident, the\r\npassengers of the American ships were very cordially invited on\r\nboard of H. M. ship of war the “Asia,” and were received in the most\r\nhospitable manner. Furthermore, through the influence of her commander,\r\na few passengers of one of the American ships who were detected in the\r\nact of smuggling on shore a quantity of tobacco, were released upon\r\npromising to do so no more.\r\n\r\nGoing on shore one day, we found on the sandy beach three or four\r\nEnglish officers who were practicing target-shooting. The target was\r\na board twelve or fourteen inches square, and placed at a distance\r\nof one-hundred yards. They were practicing with the English sporting\r\nrifles, some of them being fixed up in a beautiful style and ornamented\r\nwith silver. These rifles were fired from a rest, and with this\r\nadvantage even, the target was hit but twice out of five shots. One of\r\nour boys remarked to them that he had an old U. S. musket on board of\r\nthe ship, and offered to wager that he could put four balls out of five\r\ninto the target, off hand. One of the Englishmen asserted that that\r\nwas a huge joke “ye know”; but requested our passenger to bring it on\r\nshore and prove his assertion, which he proceeded to do. There was much\r\nmerriment among them when he returned, bringing with him an old style\r\nSpringfield rifle, or Jæger, as they were usually called; but when this\r\nyouth, off-hand, put four balls out of five into the target, their\r\nmerriment subsided, and in fact they were astonished. They asked many\r\nquestions, and when informed that the U. S. army was armed with this\r\nsort of thing they marveled greatly, and desired permission to take it\r\non board of H. M. ship of war for inspection, which they did, remarking\r\nupon its return that it was an ugly looking thing; but “by Jove, the\r\nway it shoots is simply marvelous, ye know!”\r\n\r\nOne of the officers asked the young man if all the U. S. soldiers were\r\nas expert with the use of the gun as he was, and he replied that he\r\nhad just been expelled from the army for one year, in consequence of\r\nbeing the poorest shot in his regiment, which was Co. Y. of the 287th\r\nregiment of light infantry, stationed at Fortress Monroe; but that he\r\nwas allowed one year for practice, and if at the expiration of that\r\ntime he could do the regulation shot according to Scott’s Manual of\r\nTactics, he would be re-admitted into the Army. When asked what the\r\nregulation shot was, he replied that every soldier was required to be\r\nable to put four balls out of five into a four-inch ring, off-hand, at\r\na distance of half a mile when ordered, and no postponement on account\r\nof the weather.\r\n\r\n“My hies,” was the only answer.\r\n\r\nHaving laid in a good supply of fruit, etc., we sailed out again upon\r\nthe broad ocean toward the land of gold. From this port we cannot,\r\nhowever, take a direct course for California, in consequence of the\r\nirregularity of the winds along the coast. We are therefore compelled\r\nto test the maxim that the longest way around is in some cases the\r\nnearest way home, and for such reasons our good ship is headed in the\r\ndirection of Japan until we reach longitude about 140° W., from which\r\npoint upon the equator, in consequence of the prevailing winds, the\r\ncourse can be laid direct for the port of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest pleasures of a long tedious sea voyage is in\r\nspeaking with other ships, bound for different ports of the world,\r\nand when the condition of the sea and weather permits, it is usual to\r\nexchange courtesies by giving the latest news, the destination of your\r\nship, and occasionally visiting each other. Many, of course, were the\r\nquestions asked by the commanders of other ships upon seeing so many\r\npassengers on ship-board, in that portion of the sea, not having heard\r\nof the wonderful gold discovery. One commander, in particular, hailing\r\nfrom Valparaiso and bound for Cork, who had passed several ships loaded\r\nwith passengers, very earnestly inquired if we Yankees were on our way\r\nto found a new empire somewhere among the islands of the Pacific ocean,\r\nor if we were only the rear guard of Alexander’s army searching for new\r\nworlds to conquer. We, however, satisfied his curiosity by informing\r\nhim that we were neither one nor the other, but simply Pilgrims going\r\nin search of the new Jerusalem supposed to be somewhere in California.\r\n\r\nWe had now a fair wind until near the equator, where it then left us,\r\nand there fell a great calm upon the waters.\r\n\r\nIt is in these latitudes that the conditions are most favorable for\r\nthe formation of the water-spout, for it is here where the winds are\r\nvariable, and where dead calms of long duration are the rule, and\r\nnature’s forces find the breeding grounds for the marine cyclones--it\r\nis here that the germs of the Kansas cyclones are found, in their\r\noriginal purity, free from dust, old fence-rails, hay, or ox-carts;\r\nthe upright columns being filled only with pure sea water, drawn up\r\nfrom the surface of the ocean. We saw many of them in all stages of\r\ngrowth, from the newly-formed, which was just able to move along in an\r\nupright position, staggering and swaying from side to side like a child\r\njust learning to walk, up to the monster columns which possessed the\r\npower to elevate into the regions above anything with which it came in\r\ncontact, from a clam-shell to a man-of-war. Five were seen in one day,\r\nand one of the largest of them seemed inclined to pay us a visit; but\r\nbeing aware of the fact, we made all necessary preparations to give it\r\na warm reception. It changed its course, from an instinct of danger no\r\ndoubt, which was the general opinion, from the fact that an old seaman\r\ndeclared positively that if you discharge a cannon-ball into this\r\ncolumn of water, it will instantly burst, as the proper circulation\r\nis destroyed. For the same reasons also, as the veteran salt and able\r\nseaman declared, it was even possible sometimes to frighten one of them\r\nto death by running out of the port-hole a Quaker gun, and he said that\r\nhe had seen several burst in that way. It was the most economical way,\r\nas it saved a lot of powder; but of course the rest of us old salts\r\ndidn’t believe all he said about it.\r\n\r\nWe found that upon the occurrence of any event during the voyage, this\r\nold salt could refer to a similar event within his experience that\r\nwould discount anything we had seen. For instance, during the calm he\r\nremarked that,\r\n\r\n“This calm was nothing to what he experienced at a certain time on the\r\ncoast of Chili.”\r\n\r\n“Why,” said he, “the calm lasted nearly two months, the surface of the\r\nocean became stagnant, turned green, and smelled like bilge water, and\r\nyou could see dead fish of all kinds, and even dead whales floating\r\nabout.”\r\n\r\nDuring the gale which occurred upon the Atlantic also, he remarked:\r\n\r\n“Oh, pshaw! this is nothing to what I have seen. Why, I was bound once\r\nup the Mediterranean Sea, when we encountered a gale that threw our\r\nship upon her beam ends, and we laid in that position for nearly six\r\nweeks. It blew away our main-topmast, and the last we saw of it, ’twas\r\ngoing away south toward Africa; and maybe you won’t believe it, my\r\nlads, but five years afterwards ’twas found in the great desert partly\r\nburied in the sand, where it fell. The cross trees had sprouted, and a\r\nfine cluster of white oak trees had grown up from it, more than sixty\r\nfeet high, and they made a beautiful shade for the camels to rest\r\nunder when they were cruising around the desert.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PROLIFIC TOPMAST.]\r\n\r\nI have stated at this time that the conditions are favorable for\r\nwater-spouts, as will be further explained. The formation of a\r\nwater-spout is only possible when there exists a calm upon the waters,\r\nand in consequence of the heat of the sun being reflected from the\r\nsmooth surface of the ocean, the atmosphere becomes greatly rarefied,\r\nand ascends to higher regions. The result is that at this point a\r\npartial vacuum is produced, and the atmosphere from all points rushes\r\nin to equalize the unbalanced condition. A hollow cylinder is formed\r\nof atmospheric currents, which revolves with great velocity. A partial\r\nvacuum within this is the result, and up within which the water from\r\nthe surface of the ocean rises, falling again in great showers of\r\nrain. But one great mystery attending not only the water-spout upon\r\nthe ocean, but also the cyclone upon land, is the fact of their motion\r\nforward in any direction, for since they are only produced under\r\nconditions of a calm, it is difficult to determine by what force they\r\nare caused to move in any direction, with such velocity as is often\r\nwitnessed. I observed that in a few cases, the smaller water-spouts did\r\nnot move in any particular direction, but seemed to wander about as\r\nthough undecided what course to take; while again another, but a few\r\nmiles distant to the east, would be going in a northerly direction, and\r\nanother one at the same time to the westward was taking a southerly\r\ncourse at the rate of three or four miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThat a water-spout should be able to move at all in any direction,\r\nduring a dead calm upon the ocean, when at the same time our ship was\r\nas it were, stationary is not only a mystery, but also very aggravating\r\nto those who are from necessity compelled to remain on board of her and\r\nsuffer the intense heat, and at the same time be at the mercy of these\r\nwandering, revolving tramps that are liable at any time to make you a\r\nvisit without any special invitation, and without any power whatever on\r\nyour part to avoid them.\r\n\r\nThe mystery of their forward movements lies in the fact that, at\r\nsome point the atmosphere is more highly rarified than at others,\r\nand the water-spout will therefore move in the direction of the\r\nleast resistance, being impelled forward towards that point by the\r\natmosphere, the tendency of which is to restore the equilibrium.\r\nThey will, consequently, move with a velocity corresponding to such\r\nunbalanced conditions to any given point.\r\n\r\nOh, the annoyance of a calm at sea, especially under such circumstances\r\nas when a crowd of anxious gold seekers are cooped up unable to do\r\nas, or go where they please, and all anxious to be filling their\r\nbottles and pouches from Uncle Sam’s golden fountains. Fretting and\r\nworrying could, however, avail nothing. We must gracefully submit to\r\nthe inevitable, and pray for a strong breeze from the Southwest (the\r\npraying for which didn’t amount to much, for reasons not necessary to\r\nexplain here). There was one amusement which we were inabled to enjoy\r\nto our heart’s content,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CALM.]\r\n\r\nin consequence of the calm and passive condition of Nature’s forces,\r\nand this was bathing in Neptune’s immense bath-tub, the Pacific Ocean.\r\nAt all hours of the day, many would be seen enjoying the luxury of a\r\nbath in the warm and placid waters. The sensation of plunging headlong,\r\nor diving from the ship’s rail into the fathomless depths is, for the\r\nfirst time, anything but pleasant, for upon the shady side of our\r\nship we could see below the surface a great distance. We found, upon\r\nthrowing overboard an old tin plate, or any bright object, that we\r\ncould keep it in sight for several minutes, until it had descended for\r\nthe distance of one-eighth of a mile at least, or even much further.\r\nWith this idea in mind, when standing upon the rail, all ready for a\r\ndive into this dark and bottomless abyss, one can readily imagine the\r\npeculiar sensations produced and the thoughts that flit across the\r\nmind at the moment. What if some miraculous event should occur upon\r\ndiving into the deep sea, or some wonderful changes in Nature’s laws\r\ntake place reversing perhaps the laws of gravitation, which should\r\nmake the waters lighter and organic substances heavier! Then just\r\nimagine one’s self sinking down, down into the unfathomable waters and\r\ncontinuing upon the downward course, among the huge monsters who make\r\ntheir habitations amid the rocks and cliffs at the bottom! But after a\r\nfew trials this sensation wears away, for we find that it is impossible\r\nto descend but a short distance below the surface, and that whether we\r\nwill or not, we must ascend again without delay.\r\n\r\nFor two or three days, a number of our passengers indulged in this\r\nluxury of bathing, and would have continued doing so during the calm;\r\nbut all things have an ending, and sea-bathing is no exception to the\r\nrule. The diversion was brought to an end by an incident which is worth\r\nmentioning. We had a passenger on board who, but a few years before,\r\nwhen on a voyage in the Indian Ocean, lost one of his legs in appeasing\r\nthe appetite of a shark, while enjoying the luxury of a sea-bath. This\r\nyoung man, whose name was Measury, from Salem, Mass., acted in the\r\ncapacity of sergeant at arms for us, and would allow no one to dive\r\nfrom the ship until well satisfied that there were no sharks in the\r\nimmediate vicinity. This fact he would ascertain by throwing overboard\r\nany bright object, such as a tin cup or plate, for if there were any\r\nsharks within a reasonable distance, say one or two miles, they would\r\nbe attracted towards the vessel, and could be plainly seen swimming\r\nback and forth under the ship’s keel--waiting, not like Micawber,\r\nfor something to turn up, but for some unfortunate sailor to tumble\r\noverboard. If no sharks made their appearance below the ship in the\r\nspace of half an hour, it was presumed that the coast was clear, and by\r\nthe gate-keeper’s consent, over we would go.\r\n\r\nWe had been in bathing one day, and nearly all of us had climbed\r\naboard, when our sergeant at arms, who was seated as usual upon the\r\nship’s rail upon the shady side, where he could obtain a good view of\r\nthe ship’s keel, was heard to cry out to those who were yet in the\r\nwater, but who were, however, near the ship, and just upon the point of\r\nclimbing on board.\r\n\r\n“Quick! quick boys, for God’s sake! A shark! A shark!”\r\n\r\nUpon looking over the side, we saw an enormous shark beneath the keel.\r\nHe spied the last man who was in the water, and darted towards him. The\r\nman, however, had reached the ladder, and was soon out of danger. The\r\nshark, turning upon its back with open mouth, darted towards him, but\r\nwas too late, for just at this time its career was ended. The captain\r\nwho was in the cabin, heard the cry of shark, and having been a short\r\ntime before sailing engaged in whale-fishing, was prepared for such an\r\nemergency. Seizing his favorite weapon, which was a harpoon all ready\r\nfor use, and to which was attached a long wooden pole, suspended from\r\nropes over head in a convenient place, he jumped upon the rail, and\r\nas the shark’s head with open mouth projected above the water with a\r\ntrue aim darted the harpoon into its body. The huge fish was hoisted on\r\nboard, and found upon measurement to be about fifteen feet in length.\r\nWhat a mouth, when opened! I was reminded of it years afterwards, in\r\npassing a Mendicino Co. saw-mill, with its gang of saws all in a row,\r\nready for business. This incident ended our pleasures of sea-bathing.\r\n\r\nBut now was the old salt’s opportunity to spin a yarn that would\r\ndiscount anything in the shark line, and he made the most of it. Seated\r\nupon the fore hatch, toward evening, and after taking a fresh quid he\r\nsailed in:\r\n\r\n“Well, well! me lads, that’s a big shark; but I can tell about one that\r\ndiscounts him. ’Twas when I was sailing on an English packet ship in\r\nthe Indian Ocean, bound for the East Indies. We had an opera company on\r\nboard, bound for Calcutta.\r\n\r\n“We were running along one day with a stiff breeze, and the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OPERATIC SHARK.]\r\n\r\npassengers were all enjoying themselves up on deck, when all at\r\nonce there was a cry of man overboard. An old gentleman, one of the\r\nmusicians, was seated on the lee rail a readin’, when the ship give a\r\nlurch, and away he went over the side. His son was standing near at\r\nhand, and hauling off his coat, over the side he went, to rescue his\r\nfather. The ship was brought up into the wind; a boat was lowered, and\r\nblast my eyes if we didn’t cruise about in our ship’s wake for more\r\nthan four hours to get a sight of the old gentleman and his son. But\r\nwe searched in vain, for they had gone; only, we couldn’t tell how,\r\njust then. We did though, pretty soon; for a few days after we saw a\r\nbig shark following in our wake. He was a regular man-eater, and we\r\nknew from the antics he was cutting up, that he had swallowed the old\r\nmusician and his son sure enough, and was huntin’ for the balance of\r\nthe opera company. Why, shipmates, the shark would jest promenade\r\naround ship, standing upon his tail; then he would balance fore and aft\r\non his head, and go through the figures of a quadrille in good style.\r\nOne of the opera boys said that the old musician was a tough customer,\r\nand maybe the shark had the colic. Another one thought that maybe he\r\nhad been chasin’ a French ship, and had swallowed a French dancin’\r\nmaster who had fell overboard. But we soon found out all about it, for\r\nit happened that the shark came nearer to the ship than he intended\r\nto, and one of the crew threw a harpoon into him, and we histed him\r\non deck to have a look at him. Jest as we were gettin’ ready to throw\r\nhim overboard again, one of the opera boys says ‘hush! what’s that\r\nstrange noise comin’ from inside of him?’ Well, we all heard it, and to\r\nsatisfy our curiosity we cut him open, and maybe, shipmates, you won’t\r\nbelieve me when I tell you what we seen. But right in there was the old\r\nmusician, sittin’ at a pianner and playin’ the Fisher’s Hornpipe, and\r\nlaying in a hammock overhead was his son, beatin’ time on a base drum.”\r\n\r\nThere is consolation in the thought that, under whatever circumstances\r\nwe may be placed that are of an unpleasant nature, all things, states\r\nand conditions have an ending. In the operations of Nature’s forces,\r\nman, by his ingenuity, can direct them for his use, but cannot control.\r\nDuring a gale of wind, for instance, the ship, by means of the sails\r\nand rudder, can be changed or altered in her course, and at such a time\r\nhow insignificant man appears in comparison with the force and power\r\nof the elements, which are far beyond his absolute control! Yet, even\r\nwhen the elements are in active motion, they can be made serviceable by\r\nusing the proper means; but when Nature’s forces are entirely passive\r\nand the elements are at rest, it is then that man is made conscious of\r\nhis utter insignificance, especially if he is on board of a sailing\r\nvessel which is floating about at random upon the ocean in a dead calm.\r\nAt such a time he has no control whatever over the elements above,\r\nor of the waters below, and the vessel drifts at random in whatever\r\ndirection the currents are flowing. She rises and falls with the swell\r\nof the ocean, and her sails are continually flapping against the mast\r\nas an encouragement to her patience, or as a means of quieting her\r\nanxiety. The bows, also, exhibit their intense anxiety by swinging\r\naround the circle like a chained bear, in the vain endeavor to break\r\naway from the influence of such unpleasant conditions; but the only\r\nobject on board which does not conform to the random motions of the\r\nvessel, and remained, fortunately for us, constant to the forces which\r\ngave it value, was the needle in the binnacle.\r\n\r\nThe end was near, however, for upon the morning of the 14th day, away\r\noff in the distance, toward the west, was discovered a cat’s paw, a\r\nripple upon the water, crawling silently but surely towards us upon\r\nthe surface of the waters. It crawled carefully up the side of the\r\nship, up into the rigging; and the great sails, which had been idly\r\nflapping for many days against the mast, now feel the effects of its\r\nmagic influence, and, swelling with pride, endeavor to move the ship\r\nforward upon her course. The wheel, also, which for several days\r\nhad been neglected and alone, lazily swinging from one side to the\r\nother, nodding and blinking beneath the scorching rays of the sun,\r\nwas now aroused from its slumbers by the strong arm of a sailor, and,\r\nresponding to his efforts, the bows of the ship swing gracefully around\r\nupon our course for the entrance to the Golden Gate with a fair wind,\r\nwhich increased with such force in a few hours that it was evident we\r\nhad not only received the benefit of a cat’s paw, but that the whole\r\nanimal had crawled on board, tail and all.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon of September 19th, we arrived at the entrance to\r\nthe Golden Gate, but only to find the sea enveloped in a dense fog,\r\nand the entrance through which we were in hope of passing at once,\r\nhidden from our view. The only resource was, in seaman’s phraseology,\r\n“to lay off” and on until morning, which we did in safety, although\r\nnot without escaping in an almost miraculous manner from the greatest\r\ndanger. The incident is worth relating, as it shows how it is possible,\r\nafter having sailed so many thousands of miles in safety, upon arriving\r\nat your destination to meet with disaster through the ignorance of\r\nan incompetent seaman. It was the second mate’s watch on deck, the\r\nburly-headed seaman previously mentioned. About 11 P.M.,\r\nas the Captain was about turning in for the night, the second mate\r\ncalled down the gang-way for the Captain. When asked what was wanted,\r\nhe replied that right ahead, seen through the fog, was a square-rigged\r\nvessel. The Captain answered:\r\n\r\n“Well, you know your business, of course.”\r\n\r\nAlmost instantly afterwards he again shouted:\r\n\r\n“Captain, come quick! we are close aboard of her!”\r\n\r\nThe latter leaped from his bunk, and was upon deck in an instant, and\r\nsaw at once the nationality and character of the square-rigged craft,\r\nlooming up in a dense fog, immediately over our bow. He ordered the\r\nwheel hard a port, and the old ship swung readily around in the foam\r\nand swash, and within less than half a ship’s length of one of the\r\ngreat rocks of the Faralone Islands. In less than one minute more we\r\nwould have crashed into, run afoul of, and knocked from its foundation\r\ninto the deep sea beyond, one of the grandest structures of the whole\r\ngroup, but the presence of mind of our Captain saved it from utter\r\ndestruction, as well as a few score of badly scared gold hunters. Upon\r\nthe morning of the 20th, we sailed in through the Golden Gate, coming\r\nat anchor in front of the tented city of San Francisco, having made the\r\npassage from our native city to this place in the space of five months\r\nand seventeen days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n THE ARRIVAL IN SAN FRANCISCO--GOLD MACHINES--GOING TO THE MINES--THE\r\n BULLWHACKER--ARRIVAL IN HANGTOWN--THE VIEW FROM THE HILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city presented the appearance of a vast army encampment, and it was\r\nevident that the advance guard of Alexander’s army had arrived sure\r\nenough, and had conquered what they sought. In the contemplation of the\r\nscene as we saw it from the roof of the cook’s galley, we found deep\r\nconsolation in the thought that in case the future would prove that we\r\nhad travelled so many thousands of miles in search for gold, only to\r\nfind upon our arrival that we had been badly sold, we were not alone\r\nat any rate. There was a grim satisfaction, therefore, in viewing the\r\ngreat number of vessels at anchor in the harbor from the various ports\r\nof the world, that had brought to the coast thousands of others for the\r\nsame purpose.\r\n\r\nOur voyage being ended upon our arrival in California, it is now, after\r\nupwards of forty years have passed since we sailed in through the\r\nGolden Gate, of some interest to know what has become of the passengers\r\nand crew of the old ship, and in fact of the ship also. The ship, after\r\nreturning again to New Bedford, was fitted out for a whaling voyage\r\nand lost, I think in an ice pack in the Arctic Ocean. Captain Seabury,\r\nafter serving for several years as master of a China steamer in the\r\nemploy of the Pacific Mail Co., and also upon the Atlantic coast from\r\nNew York to Aspinwall, a few years since retired from active service,\r\nand now lives in ease and comfort at his home in New Bedford. Of the\r\npassengers, there are but three of us at present remaining upon the\r\nPacific Coast. Many of them died here. The greater portion of them\r\nreturned to their Eastern homes; but a few of them are now left, and\r\nof all that number of gold hunters, not one of them succeeded in his\r\nanticipations of filling a pork barrel with the precious metal and but\r\na small portion of them in filling an old boot-leg, or a beer-bottle,\r\nwith the same.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to explain here, that the ingenuity of many mechanics\r\nin the far-off Atlantic States had been exercised in the construction\r\nof various devices for the extraction of gold from the sand and soil\r\nwhich were, unfortunately, mixed with it. Our passengers, having full\r\nfaith in their great value and efficacy, had brought quite a number\r\nof such machines with them. They were of all varieties and patterns;\r\nmade of copper, iron, zinc and brass. Some of them were to be worked\r\nby a crank; others, more pretentious, having two cranks; whilst\r\nanother patent gold washer, more economical and efficient, worked\r\nwith a treadle. One variety was upright, requiring the miner to stand\r\nwhile using it. Still another, the inventor of which being of a more\r\nbenevolent and humane temperament, was arranged in such a manner that\r\nthe poor tired miner could sit in his arm-chair and take his comfort as\r\nhe worked it.\r\n\r\nOne machine requires special mention. It was in the shape of a huge\r\nfanning mill, with sieves properly arranged for assorting the gold\r\nready for bottling. All chunks too large for the bottle would be\r\nconsigned to the pork barrel. This immense machine which, during our\r\npassage, excited the envy and jealously of all who had not the means\r\nand opportunity of securing a similar one, required of course the\r\nservices of a hired man to turn the crank, whilst the proprietor would\r\nbe busily engaged in shovelling in the pay dirt and pumping water; the\r\ngreater portion of the time, however, being required, as was firmly\r\nbelieved in the corking of the bottles and fitting heads to the pork\r\nbarrels. This machine was owned by a Mr. Allen, from Cambridge, Mass.,\r\nwho brought with him from that renowned head-center of learning, a\r\ncolored servant who was to manage and control the crank portion of the\r\ninvaluable institution; and so sanguine were all passengers in regard\r\nto the nature and value of the various machines for the purposes of\r\nsaving, or for the extraction of gold, that apparently nothing but\r\nactual trial could convince them to the contrary.\r\n\r\nTheir faith in all kinds of mining machinery was put to the test sooner\r\nthan expected; for upon landing, we found lying upon the sand and\r\nhalf buried in the mud, hundreds of similar machines, bearing silent\r\nwitness at once to the value of our gold-saving machinery, without the\r\nnecessity of a trial. Of course ours were also deposited carefully and\r\ntenderly upon the sandy beach, from where, in a short time, they were\r\nwashed into deep water, making amusement for the shrimps, clams, and\r\ncrabs, which were no doubt under the impression that some unfortunate\r\nItalian vessel, with a cargo of hand-organs, had foundered in the\r\nlocality. It was reported soon after, that the crew of a Dutch vessel\r\nthat passed near Rincon Rock close by one dark and foggy night, saw\r\ndistinctly a group of sea nymphs seated upon it, and that each one of\r\nthem was engaged in turning the crank of what appeared to be some kind\r\nof a musical instrument. Old Neptune was seen standing in their midst\r\nas leader of the orchestra, keeping time with his sluice fork.\r\n\r\nWe saw scattered around among the bushes near the shore, also, a great\r\nnumber of trunks, chests, and valises of all sizes, and the most of\r\nthem containing clothing of all descriptions, in many cases of value.\r\nThese had all been thrown aside as useless encumbrances by their\r\nowners, who had started for the mines, being unable to pay the extra\r\nfreight charged upon them.\r\n\r\nWe found that no wharves had yet been constructed, and the tide being\r\nout, it was somewhat difficult to land without wallowing through a\r\nshort distance of very dark mud.\r\n\r\nOne of the sights which attracted our attention was a newly-constructed\r\nsidewalk, commencing at the building at that time occupied by Simmons,\r\nHutchinson & Co., and extending in the direction of Adams & Co’s.\r\nexpress office, for a distance of about seventy-five yards, I think. In\r\nany other portion of the earth except California, this sidewalk would\r\nhave been considered a very extravagant piece of work, hardly excelled\r\nby the golden pavements in the new Jerusalem. The first portion of the\r\nwalk was constructed of Chilean flour, in one hundred pound sacks, and\r\nwhich in one place had been pressed down nearly out of sight in the\r\nsoft mud. Then followed a long row of large cooking stoves, over which\r\nit was necessary to carefully pick your way, as some of the covers had\r\nbeen accidentally thrown off. Beyond these again, and which completed\r\nthe walk, was a double row of boxes of tobacco, of large size. Although\r\nthis style of walk may seem very extravagant, even to an old pioneer,\r\nyet at that time sacks of Chilean flour, cooking stoves, tobacco, and\r\npianos were the cheapest materials to be found, for lumber was in the\r\ngreatest demand, selling in some instances at $600 per M., whilst the\r\nformer articles, in consequence of the great supply, were of little\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEPTUNE’S ORCHESTRA.]\r\n\r\nThe town presented a strange scene. There were but few buildings; but\r\nthe surrounding hills were covered with tents scattered promiscuously\r\nabout, without regard to method or order.\r\n\r\nBusiness of all kinds was lively, and although coin was scarce, yet\r\ngold dust answered every purpose.\r\n\r\nGambling houses and bar-rooms were numerous for the accommodation of\r\ncitizens; but the former, for the accomodation, more especially, of the\r\nminers, who were daily arriving from the mines, and who could be seen\r\ncoming from the landing place toward Adams & Co.’s express office with\r\ntheir sacks of gold dust, to be sold or forwarded to their friends in\r\nthe East. Many, however, were forced to return again to the mines in a\r\nfew days, after having struck bedrock in one of the gambling houses, in\r\ntheir curiosity to discover upon which end of the tiger its tail was\r\nhung; and they generally made the discovery.\r\n\r\nWe found the cost of living in the city very high, although certain\r\narticles, as flour, for instance, were plentiful and cheap. Meals at\r\nthe restaurants were from one to two dollars. One of our passengers had\r\nabout 80 pounds of sweet potatoes, which he sold readily for one dollar\r\nper pound, and also a few orangers which he sold for one dollar each.\r\n\r\nThe following bill of fare gives an idea of the cost of living:\r\n\r\n\r\n BILL OF FARE.--WARD HOUSE.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  RUSSEL & MYERS      PROPRIETORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _San Francisco, Thursday, October 27, 1849._\r\n\r\n\r\n SOUP.\r\n\r\n  Ox Tail,                                   $1 00\r\n\r\n\r\n FISH.\r\n\r\n  Baked Trout, White and Anchovy Sauce,      $1 50\r\n\r\n\r\n ROAST.\r\n\r\n  Beef,                                      $1 00\r\n  Lamb, stuffed,                              1 00\r\n  Mutton Stuffed,                            $1 00\r\n  Pork, Apple Sauce,                          1 25\r\n\r\n\r\n BOILED.\r\n\r\n  Leg Mutton, Caper Sauce,                   $1 25\r\n  Corned Beef and Cabbage,                   $1 25\r\n  Ham,                                       $1 00\r\n\r\n\r\n ENTREES.\r\n\r\n  Curried Sausages, _a mie_                  $1 00\r\n  Beef, stewed with Onions                    1 25\r\n  Tenderloin Lamb, Green Peas                 1 25\r\n  Venison, Port Wine Sauce                    1 50\r\n  Stewed Kidney, Sauce de Champagne           1 25\r\n\r\n\r\n EXTRAS.\r\n\r\n  Fresh California Eggs, each                $1 00\r\n\r\n\r\n GAME.\r\n\r\n  Curlew, roast or boiled to order           $3 00\r\n\r\n\r\n VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\n  Sweet Potatoes, baked                      $0 50\r\n  Irish    do     boiled                      0 50\r\n  Irish Potatoes, mashed                     $0 50\r\n  Cabbage                                     0 50\r\n  Squash                                     $0 50\r\n\r\n\r\n PASTRY.\r\n\r\n  Bread Pudding                              $0 75\r\n  Mince Pie                                   0 75\r\n  Apple Pie                                   0 75\r\n  Brandy Peach                                2 00\r\n  Rum Omelette                               $2 00\r\n  Jelly  do                                   2 00\r\n  Cheese                                      0 50\r\n  Stewed Prunes                               0 75\r\n\r\nAn observation of the crowds of persons continually arriving in\r\ngreat numbers and crowding into the new city proved them to be men\r\nof an active and energetic character, who had come for a certain\r\nspecific purpose, and were determined to accomplish it by all possible\r\nlegitimate means; but varied, of course, as to the manner, or methods\r\nof accomplishment. We found that a portion only of those who entered\r\nthe Golden Gate had any desire to extract their share of gold from the\r\nmines, but were content to remain in San Francisco, believing that the\r\nflow of gold to the City would enable them to gather in a fair pro rata\r\nof it in some business enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe monotony of a long and tedious sea voyage being now at an end, the\r\nreal business, or the object contemplated in making such a voyage now\r\ncommenced. We have entered upon new scenes, and a change of condition,\r\nwith all of its strange events and varying incidents.\r\n\r\nA company of us--twenty-three in number--came for the special purpose\r\nof mining, and all preparations for the proper working of such an\r\nenterprise had been made previous to sailing. We had purchased all\r\nnecessary tools and instruments for the purpose in view. For these\r\nreasons, we did not linger in San Francisco longer than was necessary;\r\nbut began immediately the work of putting together the materials of a\r\nlarge scow, or barge, which we had brought with us.\r\n\r\nUpon this, when complete, we placed our effects, and with a fair wind\r\nand tide in our favor, started on our journey towards Sacramento City,\r\nat which place we arrived upon the fourth day out from San Francisco.\r\nAt this place, after making a proper division of our provisions,\r\ntools, and instruments, we dissolved co-partnership as a company,\r\neach and every one going to such a mining district as best suited his\r\ninclination, or at which place, in his opinion, were to be found the\r\nrichest mines. We learned here that rich gold mines had been discovered\r\nin several places besides Coloma, the point of original discovery by\r\nMarshall. Among them were Hangtown, Greenwood, Kelsey, Georgetown,\r\nand Mormon Island. The latter mining camp, located upon the American\r\nRiver about twenty miles east of Sacramento City, was the spot where\r\nour ex-Senator, John Connors, first engaged in the mining industry in\r\nAugust, ’49. Further north were Auburn and numerous bars upon the South\r\nand Middle forks of the American River, as well as other good mining\r\nlocalities in a southern direction. Sacramento City being the point\r\nof departure for all mining localities so far discovered, presented\r\na very lively scene, and almost daily could be seen long strings of\r\nmen on their way to the mines, carrying upon their backs their roll\r\nof blankets, on the top of which would be fastened certain cooking\r\nutensils and other conveniences. After selling off all stock, utensils,\r\nscow, tent and other things belonging to the company which could not\r\nbe divided, we made a division of proceeds, and then every man was for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nTwo others and myself formed a company, and after deciding upon\r\nthe mining camp which we should visit, we employed a Pike county\r\nbullwhacker who agreed to deliver us and our effects in Hangtown for a\r\ncertain consideration, payment invariably in advance. We accepted the\r\noffer, and in a few hours were on our way to Hangtown.\r\n\r\nCaptain Pike, as we christened him, had full control of his craft,\r\nbeing captain, cook, and all hands; running into port and camping when\r\nand wherever he pleased. He was a tall, powerful man, and carried an ox\r\ngad, which was about twelve feet in length, and large in proportion, to\r\nwhich was attached a lash made of raw-hide, long and large enough for a\r\nship’s back-stay. With this he would urge\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ASTONISHED BULLWHACKER.]\r\n\r\nhis cattle forward by whacking it over their backs occasionally when\r\nthey were very tired; but, in general, this was unnecessary, for\r\nthe crack of it, which made a report like a gun, was a sufficient\r\ninducement for them to hurry up. This rare breed of bullwhackers has\r\nnow become almost entirely extinct in California. More gentle, as well\r\nas more humane, means of driving cattle have been introduced from the\r\nfar east, and it may not be out of place here to illustrate this by an\r\nincident which occurred only a few months later.\r\n\r\nA bullwhacker, with his four yoke of cattle, was driving up over the\r\nhill from Hangtown, on his way to Sacramento City. The hill was long\r\nand in some places quite steep, and the road was very crooked, winding\r\namong and around the trees. On the side of the hill was a log cabin in\r\nwhich were living a company of miners from the State of Vermont. The\r\nox driver stopped in front of the cabin for a rest, and the Vermonters\r\nlaughed at and ridiculed his method of driving cattle with such a\r\nmonster whip, used in such a cruel manner; but Pike said that:\r\n\r\n“Them air cattle couldn’t be driv any other way.”\r\n\r\nOne of the boys, however, made a bet with him that he would, by the\r\nuse of a little switch only, sit in the empty wagon and drive his team\r\nto the top of the hill, without accident or running against the trees.\r\nPike accepted the bet, and with the rest of them got into the wagon.\r\n\r\nThe Yank, as Pike called him, cut a light switch, and after getting\r\nthe oxen well started under way, took his seat upon the front of the\r\nwagon, and in that manner drove them to the top of the hill without any\r\ntrouble whatever, to the great astonishment of the bullwhacker, as well\r\nas to the cattle too, no doubt.\r\n\r\n“Well,” says Pike, “if that don’t beat anything I ever heerd tell on. I\r\nhev seen um drive a heap of cattle in old Missouri, but never seen it\r\ndone with a little baby gad like that before. Blamed if I don’t try it\r\nmyself; you Yanks beat thunder.”\r\n\r\nI have neglected to mention that, before leaving Sacramento for the\r\nmines, many who had been up there were now returning on their way\r\nhome again, if they could get there, being disappointed in their\r\nexpectations, and declaring that it was all a fraud, but little\r\ngold being found anyhow, and then only, as one of them told me\r\nconfidentially, after you had to dig away down in the hard ground three\r\nor four feet to find it. This, of course, was not very encouraging\r\nnews for men who had sailed around Cape Horn, and then to find that it\r\nwas all a fraud; but we started on, however, as before stated, for the\r\nmines.\r\n\r\nWe passed many on their way down who had become discouraged and\r\nhomesick. Among them were two or three acquaintances of mine who had\r\nbeen into the mines about two weeks, and were now returning to the\r\nEast. They explained the state of affairs, saying that there was but\r\nlittle gold to be found, and that it required very hard and laborious\r\nwork in the hot sun to get it, and very dirty work, too, as it was\r\naway down out of sight in the mud. They, therefore, advised all\r\nacquaintances whom they met to return with them.\r\n\r\nWe concluded, however, to continue on and see with our own eyes what\r\nthe chances were, and if these men who were on the way home had really\r\nspoken the truth. It required many years to find this out; and if the\r\ngreat majority of miners who are now mining, and others who mined many\r\nlong years, were asked their opinion in relation to it, they would be\r\nunanimous in their conclusion that these men did come near telling the\r\ntruth, although unconscious of the fact at the time.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been the opinion of many who came into California soon\r\nafter the discovery of gold, that the rich metal was to be found upon\r\nthe surface of the ground, and that it could be very easily scraped up\r\nand cleaned from the dirt. Consequently, there was much disappointment\r\nupon finding that it was necessary to dig in the mud and water for it.\r\nWhen engaged in mining, soon after, near the road many emigrants who\r\nhad crossed the plains with their ox teams would stop alongside of the\r\nroad and watch the process of mining. Upon one occasion an emigrant\r\ninquired:\r\n\r\n“Wall, now, and is thet the way you fellers hes to do to get the derned\r\nstuff?”\r\n\r\nWhen informed that such was the method necessary to get it, he remarked:\r\n\r\n“Yas; well, then, I don’t keer for none in mine. Gee haw, buck, jest go\r\nlang thar!”\r\n\r\nAnd for this reason hundreds passed through the mining region to the\r\nvalleys below.\r\n\r\nAbout noon of the fourth day from Sacramento we crossed over the hill,\r\nfrom the summit of which the town, with its log cabins and tents, was\r\nvisible below. We descended to near the foot of the hill, where we\r\nunloaded our effects among a cluster of pines. From this point we had\r\na full view of the creek and portions of the various ravines, where we\r\nsaw hundreds of busy men hard at work with pick and shovel. From the\r\nbusy scene a spectator, who was unaware of the object of this laborious\r\nwork, would imagine that an army had encamped in the locality and were\r\nat work in the trenches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “DON’T WANT NONE IN MINE.”]\r\n\r\nMy native town was well represented, there being at this time about\r\nthree hundred there from New Bedford who had sailed around\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DANDY MINERS.]\r\n\r\nthe Horn. I found many acquaintances among them, and all appeared to\r\nbe cheerful and confident of success in their new business. I should\r\njudge, after looking about and among the various flats, creeks, ravines\r\nand gulches for a few days, that at this time there were about four\r\nthousand persons altogether in town and in the immediate vicinity, but\r\nonly about half of them, however, were engaged in mining. The latter\r\nclass was composed, at this early day, almost entirely of citizens of\r\nthe United States, although there were a few from other countries, and\r\nall kinds of trades and professions were represented.\r\n\r\nHere at work in the mud and water, with his gold spectacles and kid\r\ngloves, was a lawyer. Near him was a physician with his pants in his\r\nboots, sporting a plug hat. Here could be found clerks, bankers,\r\nstorekeepers, barbers, hotel waiters, sea captains and mates,\r\nhotel-keepers and congressmen, nearly all from the New England States,\r\nwho had come around Cape Horn to seek their fortunes.\r\n\r\nUpon a slight elevation two well-dressed men were hard at work; they\r\nwere lawyers from the city of New York, and were styled the dandy\r\nminers; they continued mining for several months and succeeded in\r\nmaking a very respectable fortune.\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of the first gold seekers in the summer and fall of\r\n’49 houses were, of course, unnecessary. Those who were fortunate\r\nenough to be the owners of tents occupied them, but the greater portion\r\nmade their camps in the shade of the trees. As winter drew near,\r\nhowever, it was evident that other means of shelter would be necessary,\r\nconsequently log cabins were constructed around among the ravines and\r\ngulches in all suitable localities convenient to a spring of water.\r\nWood for fuel was, of course, plenty. Lumber for building purposes was\r\nscarce and very dear. All household furniture, such as chairs, tables,\r\netc., was constructed in the most primitive style, often from old\r\nbarrels and boxes when convenient.\r\n\r\nMuch ingenuity was displayed by various ones in the construction of\r\nthese household necessities, but more especially in the case of chairs.\r\nThe miner’s easy chair, which he loved to take his comfort in after the\r\nwork of the day was over, was usually made from an empty flour barrel,\r\nbeing cut out in the proper manner and made with rockers. Some, who\r\npossessed more aristocratic tendencies, would have these chairs lined\r\nand stuffed in good style, and they were pronounced very comfortable\r\nand equal to anything that could be bought in New York or Boston.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable fact was noticed at this early day in relation to the\r\nhabits of the forty-niners, when we take into consideration their\r\nisolated condition, away from the influences of civilized society, and\r\nthat was in the observance of the Sabbath, for, as a general rule, all\r\nEastern men especially were true to their early training, and rested\r\nfrom their labor, or rather from their mining labors. It was upon this\r\nday that all mending and washing was done, and other little necessary\r\nhousehold duties attended to, for it must be remembered that the\r\nwashwoman had not put in an appearance yet, but she was, however, on\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MINERS AT HOME.]\r\n\r\nOn Sunday afternoons the clothes lines would be seen filled with a\r\ngreat assortment of woolen goods, socks, etc., the one thing needful to\r\ngive all the appearance of a more advanced condition of civilization,\r\nhowever, was wanting, viz.: the “biled shirt,” which came later, and\r\nwas contemporaneous with woman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BOSTON BOY’S BUGLE.]\r\n\r\nAs before mentioned, the chief amusement upon Sunday afternoons with\r\nthe great majority was in lounging around the various saloons and\r\ngambling-houses; but to many, however, this part of the day was devoted\r\nto visiting the cabins of each other. There were many good singers to\r\nbe found among the ravines and gulches, and upon pleasant moonlight\r\nevenings could be heard the notes of “Ben Bolt” from the boys who\r\noccupied the cabin on the hill above, while from another cabin in the\r\nravine could be heard the refrain of “Do They Miss Me at Home,” or\r\n“Sweet Home.” Some, also, could be heard singing the songs we used\r\nto hear of, “Life on the Ocean Wave,” “The Last Rose of Summer,” or,\r\nperhaps, “Old Dan Tucker,” all to be concluded by the singing of “Old\r\nHundred,” “Siloam,” and “Coronation,” and other tunes of a similar\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThere were also many good musicians to be found among the miners. Many\r\nof them had brought their instruments with them, and often at night\r\ncould be heard echoing from the ravines and cañons the sounds of the\r\nfiddle, flute, accordeon and clarionet. One young man from Boston had\r\nbrought with him his favorite instrument, the bugle, and when perched\r\nabove upon the summit of a hill overlooking the town upon pleasant\r\nmoonlight evenings, the strains of “Oft in the Stilly Night,” “The\r\nEmigrant’s Lament,” or the martial strains of “The Red, White and\r\nBlue,” or “The Star Spangled Banner,” from his bugle, would be heard\r\nechoing far and near, among the ravines and gulches, and hailed by all\r\nwith the greatest delight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n BUSINESS IN THE MINES--THE VARIOUS MINING CAMPS--PHYSICIANS\r\n IN CAMP--DR. RANKIN--COLOMA--PROCESS OF MINING--THE ’49\r\n EMIGRATION--SAUERKRAUT--FEMALE INFLUENCE ILLUSTRATED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe found on arriving in Hangtown quite a number of business houses,\r\nstocked with a very good assortment of provisions and nearly all other\r\narticles for miner’s use. The merchants, as well as I can remember,\r\nwere Thomas & Young; W. T. Coleman; Sayward & Thorndike; Judge Russel;\r\nMr. Job; Judge Daniells; C. Williams, while a short distance above upon\r\nthe bank of the creek were the stores of Frost, Brewster & Price, and\r\njust below town was the store of the Governor.\r\n\r\nThere were three hotels in town: one large log-cabin, used for a hotel,\r\nwas called the Eldorado, and owned by Mr. Eltsner; another one was kept\r\nby J. Adams, and the third by Col. Backus. The most numerous business\r\nhouses in town were, however, the saloons and gambling houses.\r\n\r\nAt Cold Springs, a few miles below Hangtown, was located a mining camp,\r\nat this time consisting of a cluster of tents used for saloons and for\r\ngambling houses, and one provision store, owned by Burgess & Hill.\r\n\r\nOn the road towards Coloma, at the mining camp called Kelsy, named\r\nafter the man who discovered the placer mines here, were also two\r\nstores with the usual complement of saloons. At Coloma, which is\r\nsituated upon the South Fork of the American River, we found a number\r\nof stores and saloons, whilst just below this camp were the old saw\r\nmill and tail race, where Marshall found the nugget of gold which\r\nhas been the means of revolutionizing society and changing social\r\nconditions among us, as well as settling up the whole Pacific coast in\r\nso short a space of time.\r\n\r\nAcross the river could also be seen at this time, the name of John T.\r\nLittle in large letters, on the side of an extensive warehouse. This,\r\nwith other various signs, informed the mining community that here could\r\nbe found all kinds of mining supplies, and that the highest price was\r\npaid for gold dust. Following the road past Mr. Little’s store, up over\r\nthe mountain towards the middle fork of the American River, we found\r\nseveral camps where rich mines had been discovered. At Coloma down\r\ntowards the old mill was the store of Shannon & Cady, and near to this\r\nwere the stores of Perkins & Co., Tailor & Co., and also the gun and\r\nammunition store of F. Beckhart. Of the business men, there are now\r\nliving Thomas & Young, W. T. Coleman, Mr. Darlington, who is at the\r\npresent time in business at Placerville; Mr. Thorndike; Judge Russell:\r\nMr. Caples, Mr. Price, and I think, Mr. Brewster, all of Hangtown. Mr.\r\nJ. T. Little and Mr. Beckhart are both residing at the present time\r\nalso in San Francisco, and no doubt many of the early business men are\r\nyet living in the East, or in some remote corner of the earth.\r\n\r\nOf the physicians who were residing in the mining regions at this\r\nearly day, a number of them are yet living; and as far as I know these\r\nare Dr. Bacon of Coloma; Dr. Clark, who is now residing at Stockton;\r\nDr. Worthen, and I was informed that Dr. Ober is at the present time\r\nliving east of the Rockies. We found also in the town five or six\r\nphysicians, among the most prominent of whom were Dr. Wakefield, Dr.\r\nKunkler, Dr. Ober, and Dr. Worthen, who is at the present time engaged\r\nin his profession and residing in the same old locality. There were Dr.\r\nRankin, also, who had an extensive practice, and Dr. Clark.\r\n\r\nIn connection with Dr. Rankin, an amusing incident which occurred\r\nin the fall of ’49 may not be out of place here. The doctor was a\r\nSoutherner by birth, and one of the old school, as his style of dress,\r\nwhich consisted of a white fur plug hat, blue coat with brass buttons,\r\na buff-colored vest with trowsers to match, indicated. Upon certain\r\noccasions he sported a frill shirt front as well. Dressed in this\r\nstyle, he went one day astride his favorite Bucephalus, to visit a\r\npatient a few miles from town. It had been raining recently, and the\r\nroad upon which he was travelling was house deep with soft yellow mud.\r\nHe passed on his way a tall, large, raw-boned Scotchman, carrying upon\r\nhis shoulder a sack of flour, and as he passed the pedestrian the\r\ndoctor remarked that wallowing through the deep mud with a load like\r\nthat must be tough work.\r\n\r\n“Well,” retorted the Scotchman, “and that’s me ain business; and hed I\r\nye doon here, me mon, I wad wallow ye in the mud, too.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HE DONE IT WEEL.]\r\n\r\n“You would, would you,” says the doctor, at the same time leaping from\r\nhis horse, and landing knee-deep in the mud alongside of the Scotchman.\r\n\r\nThe latter laid down his burden upon a log, and seizing the doctor\r\nby the nape of the neck and seat of his pants, he raised him up and\r\ndropped him in the deepest part of a mud-hole. The doctor wasn’t long\r\nin getting out, and mounting his horse was soon on his way home,\r\nremarking to the valiant Scot as he turned to leave:\r\n\r\n“Well, now, Scotty, you done that weel.”\r\n\r\n“It was about sixteen years afterwards that the doctor was sitting\r\nin the bar-room of the What Cheer House, in Sacramento City, and\r\nin company with a few others, talking of old times. During the\r\nconversation he related how the tall Scotchman had rolled him in the\r\nyellow mud, and how he looked as though he had been run through a\r\nminer’s ground sluice. Sitting tipped back in a chair at the side of\r\nthe room was an old farmer, half asleep, but listening very attentively\r\nto the reminiscences of old times. When the doctor commenced relating\r\nthe incident as above, the old farmer raised upon his feet, and at the\r\nconclusion stepped up, and placing his hand upon the Doctor’s shoulder,\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n“Yas, doc’, and ye told me, ye remember, that I doon it weel, too.”\r\n\r\nOf course the doctor was somewhat astonished, as well as pleased also,\r\nto meet his old antagonist, and again acknowledge once more that he\r\ndoon it weel at any rate.\r\n\r\nHandshaking and the usual refreshments followed, as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nThe town, or village, of Coloma, is situated upon the south branch of\r\nthe American River; it was here that gold was first found by Marshall;\r\nthe old mill where he worked is still standing. Mr. Marshall resided\r\nhere during his life, living in a small cabin upon the side hill, a\r\nportion of which he had planted with vines and fruit trees. The first\r\nmining, of course, was done here, and this location constituted the\r\ngerm or nucleus from which radiated all other mining localities, for\r\nit was from this point that the prospectors started out in various\r\ndirections in the search for other mines. Some of the prospectors took\r\na southerly course and found the rich deposits among the ravines of\r\nwhat is now called Hangtown creek. Others found Kelsey’s, Spanish dry\r\ndiggings, and further north they ran afoul of Georgetown and Greenwood,\r\neach locality deriving its name, when found, from some circumstance,\r\nevent, or from the name of the finder. By the time of the arrival\r\nof the first gold seekers, who came via Cape Horn, hundreds of new\r\nlocations had been made and named around the immediate vicinity of\r\nColoma, and by the 1st of December, ’49 the country had been traveled\r\nover and prospected, from Coloma to the Slanislau River on the south,\r\nand up to the Yuba River on the north, and valuable mines found for\r\nover a hundred miles in both directions.\r\n\r\nBefore commencing the business of mining, our little company concluded\r\nfirst to build a residence, which we constructed of logs in the\r\nregulation style, with chimney in the rear, the front door opposite,\r\nand after stowing away pots, pans and kettles in their proper places,\r\nputting up bunks with all the necessary arrangements of curtains,\r\nout-riggers, etc., a few more blows with the hammer here and there made\r\nus master of the situation, or of the castle, at least.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing our residence, we started in to the business of mining,\r\nfor which we had traveled nearly half way around the globe. In a large\r\nravine near at hand, called Oregon Ravine, as it was first found by\r\na man from that State, we determined to make our first effort. There\r\nwere at work in the same locality about two hundred others. The method\r\nof mining was of the most primitive character. The dirt would be dug\r\ndown to the bed-rock and thrown to one side, as the dirt and gravel\r\nin immediate contact with the bed-rock, including the surface of the\r\nlatter also, was all that was considered of any value. This was put\r\ninto sacks and packed upon our backs down to the creek, where the gold\r\nwas separated from it by panning. Many, however, would spread their\r\npay dirt upon the ground, and when it was thoroughly dry would winnow\r\nit out by pouring it from the pan to the ground, the wind, when strong\r\nenough, answering a very good purpose. This was the style of mining as\r\npracticed by the Mexicans and also the Chileans, but it was a very slow\r\nprocess, and would only pay when no water could be found.\r\n\r\nFrom the hill above, it was a strange sight to see men of all classes\r\nand from every State in the Union thus clustered together upon one spot\r\nin common, and all inspired with the one desire, i. e., to dig gold.\r\nAll hard at work in the mud and water, with pick and shovel, each one\r\ndetermined to do his level best to get all he could in the shortest\r\ntime possible.\r\n\r\nOver in that ravine yonder is a crowd of Yankees from Maine and\r\nVermont, with a leavening of a few Missourians and Kentuckians. In\r\nthat large ravine to the right are three or four hundred hard-working,\r\nearnest, gold seekers from Massachusetts and New\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HANGTOWN IN ’49.]\r\n\r\nYork, and from Connecticut and Ohio, as well as a few from Georgia,\r\nArkansas and Old Virginia. Upon that extensive flat below, the great\r\ncrowd at work is of a more cosmopolitan character, being composed of\r\nmen from all States in nearly equal proportions. But few are noticed at\r\npresent hailing from the Southern States, except those of a sporting\r\ncharacter, who will be found among the saloons and gambling houses.\r\nAmong these, a few of the old style Southern politicians, who are\r\ndressed in regulation blue dress-coat, with its great brass buttons,\r\nand a white plug hat, can be seen daily promenading around from place\r\nto place, with the crooked cane hanging upon the arm. The emigration\r\nacross the plains in the fall of 1849 was estimated to be about 25,000.\r\nBut a small proportion of them, however, remained in the mining\r\nregions. The greater number of them being farmers, passed through to\r\nmake their homes in the valleys below.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said and written in relation to the arrival of the\r\nfirst young ladies in the mines; but the very first young ladies who\r\nmade their appearance in the mining regions of California arrived at\r\nthis time. They were the daughters of Mrs. Stuart, from the State of\r\nIllinois. Their father died during the journey across the plains. They\r\narrived in Hangtown about the middle of September, returning again to\r\ntheir Eastern homes sometime during the summer or autumn of ’50.\r\n\r\nThere were many women and children in the emigration of this season,\r\nand in consequence of the scarcity of feed for the teams, many of them\r\nwere compelled to trudge along through the sandy desert and over the\r\nsteep and rough mountain roads, for hundreds of miles.\r\n\r\nOne family to arrive at this time was that of Dr. Kunkler, with\r\nhis wife and son, who was about six years of age, and an incident\r\nin relation to them is worthy of record. An accident happened to\r\nthe doctor through which he was unable to travel on foot, and was\r\nconsequently obliged to ride in the wagon. They were traveling\r\nwith an ox-team, and for this reason, the accident to him was very\r\nunfortunate, since it was absolutely necessary for one of the party\r\nto walk alongside of the team for a part of the time, especially when\r\ntraveling among the hills. Mrs. Kunkler was a French lady, and born in\r\nthe city of Paris. She was of slight build, delicate in appearance, and\r\nunaccustomed to such hardships; but it was now absolutely necessary\r\nthat she should take charge of the ox team, for a time at least. All\r\nemigrants who cross the plains are well aware that this is a very\r\ndifficult duty to perform, even for a man. To attend to and hunt the\r\ncattle, cook and wait upon the sick and the children also, and to make\r\nready for a start again--all of this the delicate French lady attended\r\nto in good style, and walked alongside of her team (for over 800 miles)\r\nwhich she managed like a veteran, arriving in Hangtown in August, ’49,\r\nin the best of health and spirits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “DIS AM A FREE KENTRY, MASSA.”]\r\n\r\nThe doctor and his wife have both crossed to the other side; but the\r\nson, having inherited the profession of the father, practiced in\r\nSan Francisco until a short time ago, when he also joined the great\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nQuite a number of slaves from Tennessee and Kentucky were brought\r\nacross the plains during this year, and were taken into the mines by\r\ntheir masters. This kind of mining by slave labor did not, however,\r\nprove a success, and was soon abandoned. One man from Tennessee,\r\nbrought his slaves, three in number, into Hangtown and located in a\r\nsmall gulch near Spanish Ravine. The claim which they worked was rich,\r\nand the master was happy, although his happiness was of short duration,\r\nfor he was very much astonished at the close of one very pleasant day,\r\nwhen, as he went to take possession of the gold dust which had been\r\nwashed out during the day, he was politely informed by his rebellious\r\nsubjects to “Jess take his hands off from dat ar gold dust, as it\r\nbelonged to dem.”\r\n\r\nHe was further informed that “Dey was now in a free country and slaves\r\nno mor’; but if Massa was willin’ to come in and work with em on sheers\r\nhe could do so.”\r\n\r\nHe endeavored to reason with the boys, but in vain. He told them that\r\nhe would appeal to the law, which he finally did; but with no better\r\nsuccess, and he returned in disgust to Tennessee leaving his slaves\r\nmasters of the field, as well as of themselves.\r\n\r\nTwo slaves worked in the Spring of ’50 in Log Cabin Ravine, now Bedford\r\nave. They were from the city of Louisville, Ky., and owned by a very\r\nprominent physician at that place. The doctor had furnished his two\r\nslaves with a good team and all necessary supplies, and had sent them\r\nforth to earn their freedom, the agreement being that when they had\r\nforwarded to him the sum of twenty-three hundred dollars in gold, the\r\nmaster in return would send them their “freedom papers.” They were\r\ninformed that they were free men, and it was unnecessary to send money\r\nto purchase their freedom; but they were firm in their purpose to do\r\njust as they had agreed with their master, and since he had trusted in\r\ntheir word they should not disappoint him, and they did not. The money\r\nwas sent to their master through Adams & Co.’s Express, and in due time\r\nthey received their papers. In a few months afterwards they forwarded\r\nto their late master the sum of eight hundred dollars also, as the\r\nprice of their sister’s freedom, and in the fall of ’50 she met her\r\nbrothers in Hangtown with her papers of deliverance in her pocket.\r\n\r\nThere were no cradles or toms at this time in the mines, for the reason\r\nthat there was no water; but with the first rains, cradles made their\r\nappearance, and towards Spring long toms were used, but regular sluices\r\ndid not come into use until a year later. The first hole that we dug\r\nafter having measured off and staked our claims, fifteen feet square to\r\neach man, in accordance with the miners’ law, gave us the gold very\r\nfine, and by the advice of a few veteran miners who had followed the\r\nbusiness off and on for nearly eight days, we moved to other vacant\r\nspots nearer to the center of the ravine (Oregon Ravine), where we\r\nfound the gold much coarser and easier to save. It was the custom for\r\nminers to get out to work as early in the morning as possible, usually\r\nabout eight o’clock, and we quit work about four P.M.\r\nThis gave us sufficient time to finish our evening meal, and to dress\r\nup, ready for a long evening, lounging through the various gambling\r\nhouses and seeing the sights in town, which, however, at this early\r\nday were not to be compared in number or in gorgeousness with those of\r\na year later. The chief pleasure, however, among us was in visiting\r\nthe cabins of each other, and listening to the old yarns from the\r\nseafaring men, or in tasting of some of their favorite dishes, which\r\nthey had learned to manufacture out on the ocean; such for instance\r\nas “dundefunk,” “lobsconce,” and a variety of others; to hear the\r\nvarious opinions expressed upon the subject of cooking. It gave us the\r\nimpression that cooking was one of the fine arts, and that the only\r\nobject in life or the chief aim in existence was to eat. Of course\r\nwe, the novices in the art, soon became quite expert in the chemical\r\ncombination necessary for dundefunk, lobsconce, hard and soft tack,\r\netc., and in a short time were able to boast of our dexterity, also, in\r\nwhirling a flapjack up through the chimney and catching it again in our\r\nfrying pan, right side up, by holding the latter out doors on the other\r\nside of the house.\r\n\r\nIt was customary, also, among many of the miners to play all kinds of\r\npractical jokes upon each other, and one amusement, in particular, was\r\nto place a flat stone, or board, upon the top of a chimney, and then\r\nto be near at hand in the morning when the victims were trying to cook\r\ntheir breakfast amidst the smoke, occasionally coming to the door with\r\nthe tears streaming down their cheeks, swearing until all nature around\r\nlooked blue. They would assert that some “infernal sea cook” had come\r\nin the night and stolen the draught, or had turned the chimney “tother\r\nend up.” It didn’t take long, however, to discover the cause, and then\r\nthe remark was “that Nantucket sea cook of a Tom Ferney done it,” they\r\nknew.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to explain here, as it may be the means of giving\r\na wrong impression in relation to the habits of the old-timers, to\r\nelucidate what is meant by the boys dressing up after the day’s work\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SMOKED OUT.]\r\n\r\nwas done. In all civilized societies the expression “to dress up”\r\nsignifies to change, or to alter one’s general appearance by the\r\ndonning of “a biled shirt,” store clothes and a plug hat, perhaps.\r\nThere was no necessity, however, in the mines for being very particular\r\nabout the style. It is true that at this time there would be found\r\noccasionally one who would shave or trim up his whiskers and even don\r\na fancy necktie, but he was looked upon with suspicion. His ancestors\r\nwere sporting men, probably, and he had inherited the tendency. There\r\nwas not, in the opinion of these old-timers, any necessity or use in\r\ndressing up in “store clothes” or “biled shirts.” The “dress up,”\r\ntherefore, to which I had reference, consisted of washing the face and\r\nhands, taking a fresh cud of fine cut (Mrs. Miller’s brand), or donning\r\na clay pipe, well stocked.\r\n\r\nAll of my readers, perhaps, have during their lives many times read\r\nof or heard discussed the old worn-out subject of “female influence,”\r\nbut it is but very seldom that any of us are enabled to see the effect\r\nof the _absence_ of woman so practically illustrated as it was in the\r\nmines. For the first two years, or up to the arrival of the emigration\r\nfrom across the plains in the fall of ’50, the condition of the mining\r\npopulation, especially their carelessness in regard to appearances,\r\nmode of life, and habits in general, showed conclusively that man,\r\nwhen alone, and deprived of that influence which the presence of woman\r\nonly can produce, would in a short time degenerate into a savage and\r\nbarbarous state.\r\n\r\nAt this time, also, there was but little necessity for law, except to\r\nrestrain the vicious element among the few Mexican horse-thieves, who\r\nhad found their way into the mining regions, but this class, Judge\r\nLynch dealt with in a very summary style, and they soon became scarce.\r\nNo standing army or armed force of policemen were required to protect\r\nthe rights of the forty-niners, for they were, as a general rule, a\r\nclass who respected law and order, as well as the rights of others,\r\nand illustrated the fact that among a class of men who are disposed to\r\ndo what is right, with no desire to injure or trespass upon the rights\r\nof others, no law for their government or control is really necessary.\r\nIt is very true, however, that in the cases of many who had occupied\r\nhigh positions in church organizations in the East, upon finding\r\nthemselves thus placed, afar from all restraint and church influences,\r\ndid reveal their true nature by falling from grace and practicing\r\nhabits that were strictly prohibited by ecclesiastical law. Yet these\r\nwere the exceptions, only; not the rule. We were, of course, under the\r\njurisdiction of the U. S. Government; but no laws could be put into\r\nforce or executed as no officers had been appointed for the purpose.\r\nWe elected, however, an Alcalde, according to the Mexican custom, who\r\ndecided all cases occurring in relation to the disputes among miners.\r\nAll cases of a criminal nature were decided by a committee of the\r\nwhole, a jury for the purpose being chosen from the mining community,\r\nand all criminals being granted a fair and impartial trial.\r\n\r\nBut a change soon took place in our political affairs, for upon\r\nNovember 13th, 1849, the constitution of the Territory was adopted, and\r\nPeter H. Burnett was elected our first Governor.\r\n\r\nThe election to vote upon the adoption of the constitution and for\r\nGovernor in this portion of the mining region was held in the hotel\r\nof Col. Bachus, Hangtown, and the border element was very strongly\r\nopposed to the whole business, claiming that we did not require law and\r\norder, constitution or Governor either; that we were getting along well\r\nenough without them; if the Yanks undertook to play any sich nonsense\r\nthey would be sorry for it; they made some show of resistance, but\r\nwhen they saw that the Yanks were in dead earnest, and had come to the\r\nplace of voting well armed and prepared to maintain law and order, they\r\nvery reluctantly departed in disgust and the constitution was adopted\r\nunanimously.\r\n\r\nThe first persons hung in California subsequent to the gold discovery,\r\nwere two Mexicans and an American. They were hung for horse stealing\r\nand robbery during the fall of ’48, in Hangtown, and it was from this\r\nfact that the mining camp derived its name, and although the camp\r\nhas enjoyed the unenviable reputation of being the place where many\r\nmurderers and horse-thieves have been kindly laid to rest by the\r\ncitizens, in committees of the whole, yet only one other individual\r\nwas ever hung by the citizens of the place, and that was Irish Dick, a\r\nyoung gambler, who was executed in the fall of ’50 for murder. A jury,\r\ncomposed of miners, was chosen; he was granted a fair trial, declared\r\nguilty, and sentenced to be hung from the old oak tree which stood upon\r\nthe side of the hill across the creek, at 2 P.M. of the\r\nsame day. He requested permission to leap from the limb of the tree,\r\nhead foremost; but this favor, of course, could not be granted since it\r\ndid not conform to the law, and would be a very barbarous proceeding,\r\nas well as a bad precedent to establish, for in some parts of the\r\ncountry the trees were very small.\r\n\r\nThe first rainstorm in the fall of ’49 occurred October 13th. It\r\nwas a shower lasting but a few hours, and continuing in this manner\r\nthroughout the winter months with light showers, but enough, however,\r\nfor the working of cradles; and now was inaugurated the process of\r\nmining in a more business-like and profitable manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAW AND ORDER TRIUMPHANT.]\r\n\r\nClaims, which by the panning process yielded daily but an ounce or so,\r\nnow gave down, by the use of the cradle, from one to ten ounces, and in\r\nsome cases even double the last amount. The richest part of any ravine\r\nor gulch, was, of course, near the center, or where the water course\r\nhad deposited the greatest quantity, consequently the first miners\r\nwould confine their work chiefly to such portions of a ravine, and\r\nthose who came after would work nearer the banks, where the gold was\r\nusually finer and much lighter. By the use of this machine very high\r\nwages could be made from gravel, which would not pay to pan.\r\n\r\nAs winter approached, emigrants who had come by steamer and across\r\nthe Isthmus of Panama, as well as “around the Horn,” now commenced to\r\narrive in great numbers, and not being satisfied with the prospects\r\nof the camp scattered about in various directions over the country in\r\nthe search for new mines. Soon other towns and camps were started;\r\nsome very rich and valuable placer mines being discovered in the\r\nvicinity of Hangtown. Great excitement prevailed, and at this period\r\nof its history Hangtown contained almost as large a population as the\r\nchief city of the country, San Francisco, and a year later Eldorado\r\nwas called the banner county. The winter following passed without the\r\noccurrence of any events in this portion of the country worth relating.\r\nThe rains were light, with but little snow, and the weather warm.\r\nTowards spring news was received that rich mines had been found farther\r\nnorth. From this fact it was concluded that all the gold had originally\r\nbeen washed down from the north by floods or brought down by glacial\r\naction; consequently, the mines would be richer as you advanced toward\r\nthe North Pole. This belief was almost universal among the mining\r\nclasses, and some were so sanguine that such would prove to be the\r\ncase, that one miner offered to bet, “that if yer’d only go fur enough\r\nto the north yer’d find ther gold all coined and sacked up, ready for\r\nshipping.” Great preparations were therefore made for leaving the old\r\nworked-out mining regions in the central portions of the State, and\r\ntowards the spring of ’50 the stampede commenced for the Yuba, Bear\r\nRiver, and other rich mining camps at the north.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n THE KANAKAS--THE DRY DIGGIN’S DESERTED--ADMISSION OF THE\r\n STATE--SCARCITY OF READING MATTER--THE COST OF LETTER POSTAGE--THE\r\n INGENIOUS BARTENDER--PRICES OF DRINKS--CELEBRATING THE FOURTH OF\r\n JULY--HARD CHARACTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KANAKAS MINING ON THE RIVER.]\r\n\r\nEarly in the Spring of ’50, a number of Kanakas from the Sandwich\r\nIslands came up into the mines; but being of an amphibious nature, they\r\nconcluded to prospect the bed of the South Fork of the American River.\r\nThey found a depression in the bed of this river some fifty yards\r\nin length and about fifteen feet deep. After a little prospecting,\r\nthey concluded that there was enough gold in that cavity to satisfy\r\nthem, and they proceeded to work the same in the most primitive\r\nstyle. They procured a number of empty kegs to which rocks and ropes\r\nwere attached. These were sunk at the most favorable points, and the\r\nKanakas, by diving down, would shovel the sand into them. They were\r\nhauled up and the sand was washed in cradles in the usual manner. But\r\nthis deep cavity, like many others upon the various rivers, contained\r\nbut little gold, as was afterwards discovered by a company that\r\nbought out the Kanakas, for upon pumping out the water by the use of\r\nwater-wheels, not enough gold was found to pay the expense of working\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the deep holes and depressions found in the river beds\r\nof California contained but little gold was a singular discovery, and\r\nan unaccountable phenomenon to the miners, for, owing to the great\r\nspecific gravity of gold, it should always settle to the lowest places,\r\nand it is upon this principle that the miner is enabled to make use\r\nof the cradle and sluices for the saving of gold. For such reasons it\r\nwas hard to explain why the greatest quantities should be found on\r\nthe higher riffles in our river beds and the less amount in the deep\r\ncavities. The only explanation of this phenomenon, in my opinion, is\r\nthat these deep depressions found in the river beds were scooped out by\r\nglacial action after the gold had been deposited there.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of April in the spring of ’50, the central mining\r\nregions were almost entirely deserted. All business had ceased, and\r\nwithin a radius of ten miles, where hundreds of miners were hard\r\nat work but two or three months before, not more than six or eight\r\nremained. In the creek, for a distance of four miles from the upper\r\npart of Hangtown, to the village of Cold Springs, a distance of about\r\nfive miles, but four miners were at work, all doing well, and two\r\nof them to my knowledge, were washing out daily from six to fifteen\r\nounces. All hands had struck out for better diggings. Did they find\r\nthem? A few, perhaps, but the greater portion of them, who returned to\r\ntheir old mines in autumn, and found their claims occupied by others,\r\nconcluded that they rather missed it. The rains being over by the last\r\nof April, mining with cradles through the summer season was impossible,\r\nexcept in a few localities. In some cases dirt was conveyed by ox teams\r\nand other means of transportation to where it could be washed, and\r\nother miners again would throw up their pay dirt on the bank, ready for\r\nwashing in the fall.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer, an excitement was occasioned by the wish and desire\r\nof all Eastern men, or Yankees (for at that time all persons from\r\nany point east of the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio were\r\ncalled “Yanks” by all those who came from States west of it), for the\r\nadmission of the State into the Union. And the State was admitted into\r\nthe Union on September 9th, 1850. From this day, everything seemed to\r\nundergo an entire change, and instead now of being a resident thousands\r\nof miles from home in a foreign land, we had by an act of Congress been\r\ntransferred, as if by magic, into our own country, under the protection\r\nof the Stars and Stripes. Officers were now elected, and the machinery\r\nof a State Government put into motion. Posters could be found tacked\r\nupon the trees, stating that certain candidates for the various offices\r\nwould honor our town by exhorting from a stump, or from the top of a\r\nwhiskey barrel, upon the topics of the day, and what they would do if\r\nelected. Other candidates followed in proper time and order.\r\n\r\nI forgot to mention that towards spring, in consequence of the bad\r\nconditions of the roads to Sacramento City, the prices of all eatables\r\nadvanced to fabulous figures: flour at one time selling at $1 per lb.,\r\nmolasses and vinegar $2 a bottle, potatoes $1.50 per lb., and other\r\nprovisions in proportion. An Ames’ shovel was worth at this time $16,\r\nand a good pair of heavy boots from $40 to $50; but, with the opening\r\nof spring all was changed, and provisions were as cheap as in any other\r\nportion of the State.\r\n\r\nThe principal and chief article of food at this early day was the\r\nChilean bean, and such was its value that in times of scarcity, as\r\nis related by some writer who witnessed the incident very probably,\r\na miner seated upon a huge nugget of gold, offered the trifling sum\r\nof $25,000 for a dish of pork and beans. This fact, however, has been\r\ndenied by those who ought to know.\r\n\r\nThe following bill of fare will give an idea of the cost of living in\r\nthe mining region at this period:\r\n\r\n  ELDORADO HOTEL,\r\n\r\n  _Hangtown, January, 1850._\r\n\r\n  M.

An acquaintance,\r\nwho occupied a log cabin near, informed me that the only book he was\r\nable to find was an old Farmer’s Almanac, for which he paid $1.00, and,\r\nsaid he,\r\n\r\n“I read that almanac through and through, forwards and backwards,\r\nsideways and upside down, and by spring had acquired such a knowledge\r\nof astronomical science, that I could locate the signs of the Zodiac\r\nblindfolded, stand on my head and calculate an eclipse, foretell\r\nthe condition of the weather for more than ten years ahead, and\r\nprognosticate the value of the popcorn, baked peanut, and chewing gum\r\ncrops for the whole time.”\r\n\r\nTowards the spring of ’50 a little event occurred here in this\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “THERE SHE COMES, BOYS!”]\r\n\r\ntown for which it never as yet has received due credit or mention.\r\nIt was nothing more nor less than the organization of a temperance\r\nsociety, and the first in the mining regions, at least, if not in\r\nthe State. Money was contributed, and a canvas house was erected\r\nwith a seating capacity for two hundred persons. Mr. Quereau, a\r\nprominent lawyer, was chosen as the President, and Mr. A. W. Bee as\r\nVice-President. The Executive Committee consisted of G. Wheeler, F.\r\nA. Bee and three others. Meetings were held two evenings a week, upon\r\nwhich occasions old veterans in the business would enlighten the\r\naudience upon the evils of intemperance in general, as well as the\r\nhorrors and dangers which would result from frequent use of the vile\r\ncompounds sold in the mining regions for pure liquor. But all things\r\nhave an ending, and temperance societies are no exception to the\r\ngeneral rule. In the autumn of ’50, the greater portion of the active\r\nmembers of the society had departed for other mining camps, and it was\r\nfinally abandoned for want of patronage.\r\n\r\nFor the first six months after our arrival in the mines it was hardly\r\npossible to get a letter from our friends at home, the only chance\r\nbeing to send to San Francisco by some person who was going down on\r\nbusiness or for pleasure. At such times the cost of a letter ranged\r\nall the way from $1 to $2, and even in some cases as high as $3 each,\r\nfor the reason that the one who was willing to do the favor was\r\noftentimes obliged to buy a convenient position near the post-office\r\nwindow in San Francisco rather than take his place in line, and be\r\ncompelled to remain in the city longer than was necessary. But upon the\r\nestablishment of regular mail facilities into the mines, in the spring\r\nof ’50, there was a change--we received our mails regularly, and within\r\nfour days after the arrival of the steamer at ’Frisco. Upon the day of\r\nthe arrival of the mail, eager crowds of miners would gather in front\r\nof the office, and watch for the appearance of the stage as it came\r\ninto view over the top of Hangtown Hill, and “there she comes!” would\r\nbe the cry from a hundred throats, as it first made its appearance. As\r\nthe boys received their letters from Molly, Polly and “Sary Anne,” they\r\nwould take a seat upon some convenient old box or barrel, and eagerly\r\ndevour the contents, and the nature of the news, whether good or bad,\r\ncould be easily seen in their countenances.\r\n\r\n“There,” said Bob Hewitt, as he drew his coat sleeve across his eyes,\r\nafter having read his letter while sitting upon a stump in the street,\r\n“that’s just my infernal luck!”\r\n\r\n“Why, what’s the matter now, Bob?” his friends inquired.\r\n\r\n“Matter! why I have just got the news that I have lost a fortune down\r\nin old Kentuck.”\r\n\r\n“How is that?” they inquired.\r\n\r\n“Well boys, don’t you remember that little red-headed cuss who worked\r\nwith me over in the big canon last winter?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he went home on a visit and I sent a lot of specimens and\r\npresents by him to my gal, and I’ll be doll garned if he didn’t tell\r\nher that I was dead and married her himself, the little cuss, and she\r\nhad a fortune too. Oh!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN UNGRATEFUL PARD.]\r\n\r\nA regular post-office was soon established with T. Nugent as our first\r\npostmaster, and, if I am not mistaken. I think it was Mr. Nugent who\r\nfirst gave to the camp the name of Placerville sometime during the\r\nspring of ’51, although it continued to be known and called Hangtown\r\nfor three or four years afterwards, by the mining community.\r\n\r\nAt this early day, there was but very little coin, either of gold or\r\nsilver, in use in the mining regions, and gold dust was invariably used\r\nfor all business purposes. It was customary in all business places,\r\nstores, hotels, and bar-rooms, as well as in the barber shops, to have\r\nupon the counter, or other convenient place, a pair of gold scales\r\nfor weighing the gold dust, with the proper weights for weighing any\r\ndesired amount, from the price of a drink of whiskey to a sack of\r\nflour, the value of gold dust being estimated at $16.00 per ounce, or\r\n$.80 to the penny-weight, as its standard value for the purchase of\r\nall commodities. In the use of fine gold dust in this manner much was\r\nscattered and lost; but in some of the saloons the ingenious barkeepers\r\nwould take the precaution to cover the floor below the scales with\r\ncloth or zinc, and by this means increase their regular salary to some\r\nextent. Of one in particular it was said that in handling sacks of\r\ngold dust, although he was generally very careful, yet at such a time\r\nit was often observed that his hand had a remarkable way of trembling\r\nviolently. The consequence was that the cloth upon the floor below the\r\nscales panned out monthly an average of about $100, which would have\r\nbeen entirely lost but for the wise forethought of the bartender. One\r\nof the barkeepers in a prominent saloon remarked that by the judicious\r\nhandling of the buckskin sack, and with a tight floor behind the\r\ncounter it was an easy job to realize $300 per month, and, furthermore,\r\nthat he could even improve upon that, when he felt real well.\r\n\r\nThe price of drinks at the bar in the mining regions, at this time\r\nand during the winter of ’49 and ’50, were 3/4 pennyweight or about\r\n$.50 for a single, and one pennyweight (heavy) for two drinks; but\r\nit was not until the fall of ’50 that drinks fell to the regulation\r\nprice of $.25 (fancy drinks extra), which price was maintained for\r\nseveral years. At this early day, nothing could be purchased for a\r\nless sum of gold dust, or coin, than $.25, and it was not until ’54\r\nthat the little innocent but insignificant dime came into circulation,\r\nwhich was followed a few years later by the diminutive 5-cent piece\r\nand the nickel, which will in their turn, no doubt, be accompanied by\r\nthe 1-cent coin, as our civilization advances to higher conditions of\r\ndevelopment. Much has been stated in regard to the habits of the early\r\nminers, of their intemperance and manner of spending their money; but\r\nthis is all a mistake, for they were as a general rule industrious and\r\ntemperate in their habits, and in fact more so in my opinion, than any\r\nother subsequent emigration. The first\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SYDNEY DUCKS TAKE WATER.]\r\n\r\ntemperance organization in our State was organized by these same\r\nforty-niners.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that a residence in California on the part\r\nof the natives of the Eastern States, would cause them to forget\r\nthe habits of their fathers, and pass over in silence or without\r\nrecognizing, the day upon which all Americans give full expression to\r\ntheir patriotism. Among us were very many who were born and raised\r\nunder the shadow of old Bunker Hill; consequently, it was absolutely\r\nnecessary that we do honer to the day by celebrating it in the usual\r\nmanner, a knowledge of which we had acquired in early boyhood. Stumps\r\nand old logs were charged with the powder; guns and pistols were\r\nbrought into service, and upon the morning of the 4th they told the\r\ntale, belching forth the glad news, echoing through the hills that\r\nliberty and freedom had perched upon our banner, and that the 4th of\r\nJuly had arrived in California, and was going to remain with us. A\r\nmilitary company was formed, commanded by “Squire Bob” (Ed. Otis, of\r\nBoston), and with colors flying, marched to the tune of “Yankee Doodle”\r\nand other appropriate military airs, performed upon drum and fife\r\naround through the town, and when, late in the evening, we retired to\r\nour cabins, we felt that we had done our share in the celebration of\r\nthe day, and although so far from our homes, in a strange land, yet\r\nwe had not lost nor sacrificed, in our desire for gold, one jot of\r\nour respect for the old flag or love for our country. I should have\r\nmentioned that at 10 A.M., exercises were held in the\r\nlarge tent used for a temperance hall, which consisted in singing the\r\npatriotic songs “Red, White and Blue,” “The Star Spangled Banner,” and\r\nothers of a similar nature, followed by an oration delivered by Mr.\r\nQuereau.\r\n\r\nIt is probably well known that the news of the gold discovery in\r\nCalifornia reached the Australian Colonies early in ’49, and the\r\nconsequence was that large numbers of the colonists made their way\r\nhere immediately, and among them were a great many ex-convicts. This\r\nclass went into the mines, and in ’49 and ’50 there were a large number\r\nof them around Hangtown and in the immediate vicinity. When these\r\nSydney ducks (as they were entitled) were informed that a 4th of July\r\noration was to be delivered in Hangtown, they protested against it,\r\nand made certain threats that in case any allusion should be made to\r\nEngland that was at all disrespectful, the orator should suffer the\r\nconsequences. Mr. Quereau, however, nothing daunted, mounted the\r\nplatform, and, taking a large horse-pistol from under his coat, he\r\nlaid it upon the table before him, and delivered his oration in grand\r\nstyle, taking very good care not to forget old England, and he was not\r\nvery particular in the choice of his language in relation to the events\r\nwhich occurred during our struggle for Independence. But there was no\r\ninterruption from the Sydney ducks, and it was well for them that they\r\nkept good order during its delivery, for notwithstanding a disagreement\r\namong the residents of the extreme Eastern and Western portions of the\r\nUnion, each one held an individual, undivided interest in 4th of July,\r\nand any attempt on the part of these Sydney ducks to prevent or to\r\ninterfere in any manner with the regulation 4th of July oration would\r\nhave been fatal to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURIOSITY SATISFIED.]\r\n\r\nDuring the continuation of the celebration upon the evening of the 4th,\r\na slight accident occurred, although not of a very serious nature, yet\r\nvery unsatisfactory to an inquisitive mind. Dr. Ruddock found amongst\r\na pile of rubbish a keg, in the bottom of which was a quantity of wet\r\npowder. The Doctor was curious to know whether it would explode, and\r\nthe only way to find out was to try it, and he did. Placing the keg\r\nupon the ground in a suitable position, he stepped back a few paces\r\nfrom it, and with a shot-gun fired a charge into the keg, and his\r\ncuriosity was satisfied. He concluded the celebration of the day in a\r\nvery heroic manner, but remarked when his friends, Luke Richardson,\r\nHale Moore and Dr. Marshall were painting and oiling his badly scorched\r\ncountenance, that he thought he had finished up the festivities of the\r\nday very creditably. Said he:\r\n\r\n“I had no idea that the darned old keg would kick back in that way;\r\nbut anyhow my experiment was a complete success, and that’s some\r\nsatisfaction.”\r\n\r\nFresh beef was now very plentiful and cheap in all the mining\r\ndistricts, and droves of wild Spanish cattle could be seen wending\r\ntheir way over the hills and among cañons, destined for the various\r\nsettlements. It required, usually, quite a large number of Mexican\r\ncattle men, or Vaqueros, to drive a small drove of these wild cattle\r\nfrom Lower California to the mining regions, to prevent their\r\nstampeding, which they will often do when becoming frightened. Some\r\ncurious scenes and narrow escapes of the miners among the ravines were\r\noften witnessed, one in particular more comical than serious, however.\r\nUpon the arrival into the lower part of the town of a small drove of\r\nthis species of beeves, they became frightened, and the usual stampede\r\nand scattering among ravines and gulches in all directions was the\r\nresult. A miner was seated upon his stool, washing with his cradle.\r\nOn the other side of him was the pit from which he was digging his\r\npay dirt. This pit was about twelve feet square and about six feet in\r\ndepth. Hearing a noise in the rear he turned his head, and saw very\r\nnear him a wild steer, with the long regulation horns and with blood\r\nin its eye. He had no time to run, but leaped over his cradle and into\r\nthe bottom of his pit. The steer, not to be foiled, followed in his\r\ntrack over the cradle and into the pit with the miner. They faced each\r\nother for a moment, and it was difficult to tell which was the most\r\nfrightened, the steer or the miner. The latter scrambled out as soon as\r\npossible, and the steer was secured. This was the only instance ever\r\nknown of a miner’s claim being jumped by a wild steer.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a storekeeper in town found among a load of provisions\r\nhauled from Sacramento City, a barrel of provisions of some kind, which\r\nfrom all appearances and smell was so badly damaged as to be unfit for\r\nuse. It was therefore consigned to the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BULLING THE MINE.]\r\n\r\nrubbish heap in the rear of the store, where it was soon covered up\r\nwith empty barrels and boxes. The proprietor noticed that certain\r\nemigrants from the Fatherland would be seen occasionally prowling\r\naround the back yard, apparently having lost something. But little\r\nattention, however, was paid to them, and one day a burly Dutchman came\r\ninto the store, tired, covered with dust, and said:\r\n\r\n“I vants me some von dot, for I vas walked more as den miles.”\r\n\r\nThe storekeeper remarked that he couldn’t tell what “dot” was.\r\n\r\n“Vell, den, I shows you vat I want. You shust come mit me.”\r\n\r\nThe storekeeper followed him to the rear of the store, and the\r\nDutchman, pointing to the rubbish heap, remarked that “some of dot in\r\ndere vas vat he wanted.”\r\n\r\nThe boxes and barrels being removed, the barrel of rotten meats was\r\nexposed to view, and he was informed that the contents were unfit to\r\neat.\r\n\r\n“Ach, mein Gott! I knows better as dot. You shust bust em in, und I\r\nshows you.”\r\n\r\nThe storekeeper, to satisfy him, with an axe “busted em in,” and found\r\nto his astonishment that instead of its being a barrel of rotten hams,\r\nit was, in fact, a barrel of good, old-fashioned sauerkraut of mature\r\nage made in Holland having been brought around Cape Horn in some ship.\r\nWhen the storekeeper inquired of the man how in the world he knew what\r\nwas in that barrel, with a toss of his shaggy head and with a vigorous\r\nsniff he replied:\r\n\r\n“Vell, den, I shust nose it!”\r\n\r\nThis sauerkraut sold readily at a fabulous price, $1 per pound being\r\nconsidered very reasonable. The odor of it had been wafted by the winds\r\nthough the various ravines and gulches among the hills, and soon was\r\nscented by the Dutch miners from afar, who came from all directions to\r\nindulge in the odoriferous compound brought from the Fatherland.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, quietness and peace had reigned and but few quarrels\r\nhad occurred among the residents of the country, and, as far as I know,\r\nno one had been shot. Neither had there been any robberies committed,\r\nfor there was no necessity of it since all had the opportunity of\r\nengaging in, what was at that period in the history of the country,\r\na very profitable business. Locks upon doors were unnecessary, and\r\narticles of value, as well as the gold dust in the cradle, could be\r\nleft upon the claim in perfect safety. It was from\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “I SHOST NOSE IT VEN.”]\r\n\r\nthis fact that originated the old, worn-out term of “honest miner.”\r\n\r\nMany strange characters crossed the plains at this season; but a very\r\nfew, however, came with the intention of mining or of making a living\r\nby manual labor at all, the great majority of them being bar-room\r\nloafers and gamblers. They all succeeded, however, in making a living\r\nby the use of their capital, which consisted principally of their wits.\r\n\r\n“Old Pike” was a character common in the gold regions, and specimens\r\nof this genus could be found in every mining camp. They were generally\r\nadvanced in years, good natured, and afforded no little amusement to\r\nthe miners.\r\n\r\nThe back-woods fiddler, usually from Arkansas, was also a character\r\nseen in every mining town, and his chief business was to seat himself\r\nupon an old box or barrel by the saloon door, and give to the miners\r\nwho congregated in the town after the work of the day was over a\r\nspecimen of Arkansas music, such as the real genuine “Arkansas\r\nTraveler,” with all its variations. By this means he was enabled, at\r\nany rate, to sample the various liquors at the bar, which answered also\r\nfor victuals and clothing.\r\n\r\nAnother singular character in the mines was the genus generally\r\ndesignated as “Dutch Charley.” They were Hollanders by birth, and\r\nsailors by occupation, and singularly enough they were almost\r\ninvariably the most fortunate miners in the camps in early times. Their\r\nclaims were rich, and they enjoyed their affluence to the highest\r\ndegree, for it was no uncommon sight to see one of these “Dutch\r\nCharlies” parading in town, on a Sunday, with a huge gold watch in each\r\nvest pocket and with an immense chain suspended around his neck and\r\nwaist, with the ends reaching near to his knees. These chains were made\r\nfrom gold nuggets, which were fastened together with copper wire. But\r\nthe career of this genus was short, and as the rich ravines were worked\r\nout many of them became very poor and hardly able to make a living, the\r\nmajority finally returning again to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe circus must not be forgotten, for in any quarter of the globe where\r\nan audience can be scraped together will be found the circus. The\r\nfirst to make its appearance in this part of the mining regions was\r\nCostello’s. It was, I think, in the Autumn of ’50. He had the usual\r\ncomplement of horses and riders, with the clown as a chief feature,\r\nwithout which the circus would be a very tame affair. The tent was\r\nusually crowded of an evening with men and women principally, for the\r\nsmall boy who crawls in under the canvas had not as yet put in an\r\nappearance in the mining regions, being a later production, and only\r\ncoming upon the scene as population increased and society was elevated\r\nto higher conditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUTCH CHARLEY.]\r\n\r\nIn the first settlement of the mining regions, game of all kinds was\r\nvery plentiful, but as the country became more thickly populated, the\r\ndeer and other game remained higher up in the mountains. Quail and\r\njack rabbits are even at this late day very plentiful. Lions, as well\r\nas lynx and wild cat, are often encountered by the prospector, but are\r\ngenerally great cowards, and therefore harmless. The grizzly bears, the\r\nking of beasts of this region, which were often seen by the miners,\r\nhave emigrated to new pastures. It was unsafe to encounter one of these\r\nanimals unless well armed. Good runners and good climbers they were no\r\nrespecters of persons, and would attack a lawyer, doctor, or even a\r\nminister of the gospel as readily as a common miner, and enjoy it just\r\nas much. The tarantulas also, were very numerous at this time, and a\r\ndangerous insect to frolic with unless there was a mutual understanding\r\nat the start. Many were bitten by them, and in a few cases the bites\r\nproved fatal. Upon camping out amongst the tall grass, it was found\r\nto be a very wise precaution to first turn your boots wrong side out\r\nbefore putting them on in the morning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURN YOUR BOOTS.]\r\n\r\nThe grizzly is of all animals the hardest to kill, and for this reason\r\nmany hunters were very seriously injured and killed by them. A miner,\r\nwho was at work near town, came running in one morning with the news\r\nthat he had just seen a big grizzly in the brush behind his cabin. It\r\ntook but a short time for the old Kentucky hunting sport, Dan Boone, a\r\ndescendant of the original Daniel, to collect together other lovers of\r\nbear hunting, who, armed with the long barrelled Kentucky rifles, were\r\nsoon on their way in search of his silver-tipped majesty. They found\r\nhis trail, and followed it\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOO MUCH FOR THE BEAR.]\r\n\r\nfor some distance down the big cañon, until they finally lost it among\r\nthe brush and rocks. They then went to the summit of a low hill to\r\nawait future developments, but they didn’t have long to wait, for\r\nthe bear in the meantime had struck their trail, and was looking for\r\nthem. The animal was soon seen near the foot of the hill, forcing its\r\nway through the thick underbrush towards them. Boone was in command\r\nfor the occasion, and arranged his men in line ready for the word of\r\ncommand, and in a few minutes the great animal came into full view\r\nout of the brush and distant from them about 50 yards. Then came the\r\norder to fire, and the report of nine rifles echoed among the ravines\r\nand cañons. The bear stopped, looked up towards the hunters, shook his\r\nhead with a savage growl, and continued to move upward toward their\r\nworks. Boone ordered them to load hastily, and at the word every man\r\nto fire and then everyone for himself. When the bear had come within\r\ntwenty yards of the line, the order was given to fire; but running was\r\nunnecessary, for the bear rolled over from the weight of lead. When\r\nskinned, eleven rifle balls were found in its body. A miner in Shasta\r\nCounty towards the spring of ’50, while out prospecting, was met upon\r\na narrow trail by a fine healthy specimen of a grizzly, and it seemed\r\ndetermined to salute the astonished miner with an affectionate and\r\nloving embrace; the latter resisted vigorously the loving advances of\r\nthe brute, and by a great display of courage and activity did succeed\r\nin saving his life, but not without receiving serious injury, his\r\nface being badly torn and one of his eyes entirely destroyed. As the\r\ncountry became more thickly settled, the rattlesnake, the scorpion, and\r\nthe tarantula, as well as all other dangerous and venomous animals,\r\nfollowed in the trail of the coyote, wild cat, deer, and the grizzly,\r\nfor new pastures far away from the haunts of men, the range of\r\nsix-shooters, patent breech loaders, long range 42 calibre, whiskey,\r\nand the influence of civilization, generally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PROSPECTOR AND THE BEAR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nCLIMATIC CHANGES--APPEARANCE OF FAMILIAR HERBS--RATS--THE TRUE\r\nTHEORY--FALL EMIGRATION--THE JOHNSON CUT OFF--THE TARGET--THE FIRST\r\nYOUNG LADY--A SPARTAN MOTHER--THE BOYS UP A TREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was often maintained by older heads, even at this time as well as\r\nsubsequently, that climatic changes followed emigration to any or all\r\nparts of the world, and that various plants also would follow in their\r\ntrail; but why was this? Whatever the theory may be, we found the fact\r\none of verity in our experience in California. Can we ever forget the\r\nold-fashioned herb bag of our boyhood days suspended from the rafters\r\nin the garret, which we used to take delight in pelting with corn cobs\r\nand other convenient missiles, and which contained the precious herbs\r\nand medical plants that our grandmothers had carefully collected,\r\ndried and stowed away for future use? We surely can never forget our\r\nunpleasant familiarity with a portion of the contents of these same\r\nbags, when suffering from those same complaints with which “grandma”\r\nso assiduously and successfully coped! Now, had the grandmothers who\r\ncrossed the plains to make their homes upon this side of the continent\r\nbrought with them the ancient herb bag? More than likely was it, that\r\nfrom this bag, suspended from the hoops that formed the covering of\r\nthe wagons, the seeds were scattered along the highways and byways;\r\nfor here in this far-distant land where never before were they seen\r\nor known, could the familiar plants be discerned, sprouting into life\r\namong the ravines and gulleys. For instance, here was the horehound,\r\nthe motherwort, the spearmint and the entire family of mints, including\r\nof course the mint julep, and following later, the U. S. Mint. The\r\nwild parsnip, the wild turnip and the catnip (including also in the\r\nlist a great variety of other nips found at the bar), were additional\r\nevidences of the influence of civilization, upon the Fauna, Flora and\r\nherbaceous productions of new settlements. The old fashioned mullein\r\nstalk, with which we were all familiar in our boyhood days, delayed its\r\nappearance in California, at least in the mining regions, until about\r\nthe year ’58, at which late date it came in the following authentic\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\nA Mrs. Coates, a resident of Reservoir Hill, Eldorado County, requested\r\na friend in the State of Wisconsin to send her a package of the cherry\r\ntomato seeds. The friend complied, and the seeds were received in\r\ndue time and planted. They thrived exceedingly, attaining immense\r\nproportions far above the diminutive turnip and radish plants around\r\nthem; but it was found, alas, as they raised their heads above the\r\ngarden fence that the cherry tomato was only a mullein stalk. They\r\nwere allowed to mature from curiosity, and the seeds being blown into\r\nthe water ditch near at hand the plants became profusely scattered\r\nthroughout this portion of the mining regions. In referring again to\r\nthe appearance of the plants before mentioned seeming to follow upon\r\nthe trail of emigration, it is proper to mention here a mysterious\r\nphenomenon which was observed afterwards in the appearance of new\r\nvarieties and species of plants, found in the mining regions wherever\r\nthe surface soil had been disturbed, or where the dirt and gravel from\r\nbelow had been thrown upon the surface and exposed to the action of\r\nthe sun and atmosphere. On these piles of dirt, sand or gravel, new\r\nspecies of plants would be often found that had not previously been\r\nseen in the locality. This phenomenon has for many years been reasoned\r\nupon, by not only the mining class, but by many able scientific men as\r\nwell, in relation to the new species or plants, that spring forth from\r\nthe soil and gravel that have been drawn up from great depths below\r\nthe earth’s surface. Many theories have been advanced in explanation\r\nof the phenomena, and by many scientific men it is maintained that the\r\nseeds of such plants have been lying in a dormant state for centuries,\r\nperhaps, below the surface; but could not germinate until exposed to\r\nthe sun or atmosphere. We find upon visiting again the mining regions\r\nwhere we worked in early days, that the hills and ravines in many\r\nplaces where originally there stood here and there an oak, are now\r\ncovered by a thrifty growth of pine trees, many of them now nearly 40\r\nyears of age and of great size. The question, therefore, arises as to\r\nwhat caused these young pines to start from the ground after the miner\r\nhad commenced his labor of extracting the gold.\r\n\r\nWhy had they not started previous to the discovery of gold; if mining\r\namong the ravines and hills changed the conditions which were necessary\r\nto make the coming of the young pine possible, what then were the\r\nconditions, and what was the nature and cause of the change? In the\r\ninvestigation of this phenomenon, I found one fact well demonstrated,\r\nand that is that these young pines spring into life from the ground\r\nonly in those localities where oak trees had been standing, and which\r\nhad been cut and removed from the ground. It was upon this now vacant\r\nground that the young pines came forth in such numbers, and so thickly,\r\nas though the pine nuts had been sown in the same manner as grain\r\nwould have been. From this fact, it is evident that the removing of\r\nthe oak is the condition or the change required to bring them forth;\r\nbut yet the question still remains unanswered. I found many localities\r\nnow covered with this thick growth of pines that formerly but a few\r\nonly of the oaks had occupied (and in some cases they were at least\r\n150 feet apart), so it could not have been, as has been maintained,\r\nthat it was owing to their shading the ground that the young pines\r\nhad not before sprung up. Some scientists who have written upon\r\nthis subject maintain that the seeds of the pine are scattered just\r\nbeneath the surface of the ground; but, owing to the shade of the oak,\r\nthey cannot germinate, and lie there dormant for hundreds of years,\r\nperhaps, until the conditions become favorable for their growth. My\r\ninterpretation of this phenomenon is, that this soil is natural to the\r\npine, or in other words the proper elements which bring into existence\r\nthis species of vegetation, as the pine tree, are indigenous to the\r\nsoil, for the reason, no doubt, that all of these barren places were\r\nin some pre-historic age, covered with pines: but in consequence of\r\nunusual dry season or by fire had become destroyed. Then again the\r\nquestion arises, that since the oaks are not natural to the soil in\r\nthese locations, how then came they there? This can be explained by\r\nthe fact that the natives who inhabit these regions subsist upon the\r\nacorns to some extent, and by them are scattered among the hills\r\nthroughout the country; they become imbedded in a short time beneath\r\nthe surface, germinate, and grow into great oaks. An accidental\r\nproduction, therefore, not natural to the soil, but which extract from\r\nit certain important elements necessary for the growth of the pine,\r\nand the latter, as a consequence, cannot spring into life until the\r\nformer are removed. In other words, it may be stated that since the\r\nexistence of any form of life, whether vegetable or animal, can only be\r\npossible when the conditions are favorable for such an existence, it is\r\ntherefore very evident that the growth of the oak tree upon this soil\r\nchanges, in some peculiar manner, those conditions which are necessary\r\nfor the growth of the pine; consequently, the latter cannot have an\r\nexistence until the conditions are rendered favorable by the removal of\r\nthe former. That such is the true theory has been well demonstrated,\r\nin my opinion, in a few instances here in California in the case of\r\nthe wild oats, when a field of wheat has been transformed or changed\r\ninto the former. Wild oats being indigenous to the soil, or, in other\r\nwords, the proper elements being contained within the soil necessary\r\nto produce this variety of cereal will under certain conditions, for\r\ninstance, such as plowing, cultivation, or in stirring of the loose\r\nsoil, spring forth spontaneously without the necessity of previously\r\nsowing the seed, and thus preventing the germination of the wheat. This\r\nsingular phenomenon has occurred upon three separate occasions here to\r\nmy knowledge, and is, as far as my knowledge extends, a phenomenon that\r\nhas never been known to occur in any other country except upon a much\r\nsmaller scale.\r\n\r\nBut the question might very properly be asked, Since these pines are\r\nindigenous to the soil, and await the time when all proper conditions\r\nare favorable for their growth, why do they not come forth and cover\r\nthe ground previous to the growth of the oak, as well as after the\r\nlatter has been removed?\r\n\r\nThe only explanation of this in my opinion is, so far as it is possible\r\nto understand the phenomenon, that the presence of the oak growing\r\nupon the heretofore barren sod, makes the conditions in some peculiar\r\nmanner favorable for the germination of the pine, by transferring such\r\nelements from the atmosphere to the soil as are favorable for it, or\r\notherwise extracting from the soil certain elements which are obnoxious\r\nto its growth, and for such reasons, therefore, upon the removal of the\r\noak the young pines make their appearance; at any rate the phenomenon\r\nexists, whether the above explanation is the true one or not.\r\n\r\nThere also was soon seen the old faithful family house-dog, who had\r\nfollowed patiently and wearily through sandy deserts and over mountains\r\nthe train of his master to find a new and a more pleasant\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST RAT IN THE MINES.]\r\n\r\nhome upon the Pacific slope; but up to the spring of ’50 not a single\r\ncat, or “Kitty,” was seen in this part of the mining regions. Many\r\nstarted with the trains but died before reaching here. In the fall of\r\n’50 many were occasionally seen, having been brought from Oregon and\r\nthe lower part of California. Domestic animals will, like the herb, and\r\nfor similar reasons (if any one can explain what they are), follow in\r\nthe trail of advancing civilization, for here now, at this early day,\r\nwhen we have only scarcely arrived, and have hardly had time to get\r\nsquared around and get located, or to look about us, we find among us\r\nthe familiar plants, the faithful house-dog, the occupant of the hearth\r\ncorner--the cat, and now but one thing, or but one more animal, is\r\nwanting to complete the complement needed to give all the appearance of\r\nan Eastern home which we have deserted, perhaps forever, and that is\r\nthe affectionate and the docile rat. Oh, where is the rat! why has he\r\nso long delayed!\r\n\r\n“He is here! here he is! hello, boys, boys, quick! he has come at last!”\r\n\r\nA rush and a commotion in the street outside gave evidence of some\r\ntragic event which had occurred, or was about to take place. Men were\r\nrunning from all directions; some with guns, pistols and weapons of\r\nvarious descriptions and calibre, from a bean blower to a mountain\r\nhowitzer, and all appeared to be concentrating their forces toward a\r\ncertain grocery store, in front of which were a number of men who were\r\nhopping, stamping, and jumping around upon a pile of straw. All were\r\nevidently in the last stages of “jimjams,” for they all swore that\r\nthey had seen a big rat, while others again, who seemed more quiet and\r\ncomposed, maintained that, although they hadn’t seen him, yet they were\r\npositive that they smelled him. Yes, it was true, for soon its body was\r\nfound in the straw, horribly mangled, so much so that its countenance\r\nwas unrecognizable, but its tail was, and that told the tale of its\r\nspecies. It had sponged its way up from San Francisco in the straw of a\r\ncrockery crate, and thus ended the career of the first rat that arrived\r\nin Hangtown, on or about March 1, 1850.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of every ship into San Francisco brought its full\r\ncomplement of rats from various parts of the world. The consequence\r\nwas that, by the fall of ’50, the chief towns near and convenient to\r\nSan Francisco were overrun with this species of animal. During a walk\r\nthrough the principal street in Sacramento in the evening, after the\r\nbusiness of the day was over, they could be seen in swarms, and in\r\nsome localities it was even difficult to walk along without stepping\r\nupon the innocent creatures. On one sidewalk in particular, in J\r\nstreet, I think, upon which were piled sacks of grain and produce\r\nof various kinds, could be seen rats by the thousands, of all sizes\r\nand nationalities, crawling in among, through, and over these sacks\r\nin every direction; through tunnels, down shafts and drifts, in true\r\nminer’s style, and from their sleek, healthy\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RATS.]\r\n\r\nappearance they had evidently struck it. They were different in\r\nnationality, which was evident from their choice in the selection of\r\nfood; for instance, in among a pile of sacks containing cabbages, were\r\nthe Dutch species of rats, brought over in some ship from Holland.\r\nThere was no mistaking their birthplace, for scraps of Bologna\r\nsausage were scattered about, and the scent of Limberger cheese was\r\nperceptible. Upon a pile of sacks containing corn, was seen a number\r\nof very healthy corpulent chaps who appeared to be engaged in debating\r\nsome important question. They were probably of English stock, and were\r\nholding a debate upon the corn laws. Upon a pile of sacks which were\r\nfilled with wheat, was seen a large number of rats of all sizes and\r\ndescriptions: some with long tails, some with short, and some with no\r\ntails at all. They appeared to be engaged in a fierce warfare over\r\nsome very important question, and were scratching, biting, pulling\r\nand hauling each other around in a most vicious manner. A closer\r\nobservation evidenced the fact that these were the true American\r\nspecies, and were wheat brokers “on ’change.” There was no mistaking\r\nthe nationality of those rats prospecting among the stack of potato\r\nsacks beyond, for standing erect upon the top of it, in a very striking\r\nattitude, with its paws up in Yankee Sullivan style, was a huge rat,\r\nits long tail carelessly thrown over an immense potato in front of it,\r\nand in imagination we heard it remark to its companions around it:\r\n\r\n“Now, me lads, bring on the b’ys who’d be afther jest treading on me\r\nfoine tail, thin!”\r\n\r\nA pile of mats containing rice was honored by the presence of a lot\r\nof Chinese rats. The style of eating, and the manner of handling the\r\nchop-sticks was an evidence of this fact.\r\n\r\nThe time was now near at hand when the semi-civilized conditions under\r\nwhich the earlier emigrants had been living, were to be changed; for\r\nthere was quite a large emigration on its way from Missouri, Texas and\r\nother States west of the Mississippi, and among them were some of the\r\nmost desperate characters of the frontier. The first arrivals of the\r\nemigrants created no little degree of excitement among the younger\r\nportion of the community, especially from the fact that it was learned\r\nthat a number of young ladies were on their way to the mining regions,\r\nand would probably pass through the town. About this time, which I\r\nthink was in August, ’50, quite a large number of miners were at work\r\nin and near the creek, along\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST YOUNG LADY.]\r\n\r\nthe margin of which was the regular emigrant road, following the course\r\nof the creek for nearly two miles.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon of one pleasant day that the news was\r\npassed along down the creek, from the miners above to others below,\r\nthat a train was coming in which a very pretty young lady was the chief\r\nattraction. A dust cloud was soon seen away above, showing that the\r\ntrain was near at hand, and the miners left their work and arranged\r\nthemselves near the road. As the train approached, the young lady\r\nwas seen in advance riding the old family gray mare, and apparently\r\nunconscious of the sensation which she was the innocent cause of\r\nproducing among that crowd of unwashed, uncombed and unshaven miners.\r\n\r\nShe was, as all would swear to, a very pretty girl from the State of\r\nKentucky; the daughter of a colonel who was a veteran of the Mexican\r\nwar. Of course, it would never answer for ladies who had been traveling\r\nover mountains and sandy deserts for three or four months, to appear\r\nagain in a civilized community in traveling costume, so a halt had been\r\nmade previous to their entry, a few miles above, and toilets properly\r\narranged. The young lady was dressed plainly but neatly in a common\r\nblue calico dress, with a yoke attachment at the top, heavy flounces\r\naround the bottom cut bias style, but no paniers to speak of. She wore\r\na broad-brimmed Leghorn, milk-maid style of a straw hat, and a broad,\r\nblack velvet ribbon around her neck.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the family had not been so particular and looked\r\njust like all other emigrants. The wagon contained, of course, the\r\naged parents, with the usual complement of tow-heads found among all\r\nemigrant trains.\r\n\r\nThe remarks made by the various miners as the young lady passed along\r\nupon the old gray mare were very amusing. One youth remarked that,\r\n“Them eyes of her’n are jest exactly like my Mary Jane’s,” and another\r\none says, “Now that nose and chin and her hair, too, is exactly like\r\nmy Marthy’s down in Kennebunk.” “But ain’t she lovely, though?” asked\r\nanother, and so on, each one remarking how much she resembled and\r\nreminded him of some one often thought of away across the continent.\r\n\r\nOne young man had the audacity to remark, in the hearing of them all,\r\nthat “That young Kentucky gal wern’t half so good looking as his\r\nMatilda Jane down in Jersey,” and they gave the youth to understand\r\nthat they would have a settlement with him for expressing such an\r\nopinion. But the next morning, on coming out to work, they found two\r\nstakes driven upon this young man’s claim, and on one was an old\r\nsun-bonnet, while on the other was fastened a young lady’s slipper. He\r\nhad evidently purloined these from the wagon during the silent watches\r\nof the night, knowing them to be the property of the young lady from\r\nKentucky. Under such circumstances it was evident that he had repented\r\nof his rashness, and he was freely forgiven upon the condition that he\r\nwould make a division of the plunder, which he did.\r\n\r\nThe train went into camp near town, and after the day’s work was\r\ndone, many of the younger boys lounged around in the vicinity of the\r\nstrangers’ camp to get a sight of the pretty Kentucky girl.\r\n\r\nWhile she was engaged in frying pancakes for the evening meal, a young,\r\nsandy-haired miner proposed to purchase one of them from her. She said\r\nthat they were not for sale, but that she would give him one with\r\npleasure, which she did by dropping it hot from the pan into his hand,\r\nand he returned the compliment by dropping into her hand a very pretty\r\ngold specimen, which she refused to accept. Upon a little persuasion\r\nfrom the modest youth she changed her mind, however, and slipped it\r\ninto her pocket.\r\n\r\nThe emigrants continued straggling in, some on foot and alone, and\r\nothers in trains drawn by horses, mules or oxen. The variety of\r\nvehicles was legion, as some had two wheels and others four; while\r\none man, a tall, sandy-haired Scotchman, rolled along over the dusty\r\nroad, over mountains, through rocky cañons and across the barren desert\r\nfrom St. Jo, in a carriage with but one wheel, to wit, only a common\r\nwheel-barrow.\r\n\r\nThe emigrants of this year suffered terribly in consequence of the\r\nscarcity of grass for animals, for which reason many cattle died, and\r\nthe emigrants were compelled to finish their journey for hundreds of\r\nmiles on foot. There were numerous deaths from exhaustion, starvation\r\nand disease. After their arrival in town, however, many died from\r\nover-eating, and in some cases it was necessary to restrain them by\r\nmain force from gorging themselves while at the dinner table.\r\n\r\nFour young men in town procured horses, and, loading them with\r\nprovisions cooked ready for use, started out to feed the starving\r\nemigrants. A few miles from town they encountered an ox team which was\r\nstanding in the road. The driver, a large, powerful man, was seated\r\nin the road in the dirt and dust in front of them gnawing, or rather\r\nsucking, a small piece of pork rind, and in the covered wagon was found\r\nthe wife and mother, with two or three children, engaged in a similar\r\non occupation. It was the last of their supplies, and upon which they\r\nhad subsisted for the previous two days. The young men, therefore,\r\nfurnished them with the necessary supplies at once.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EMIGRATION OF ’50.]\r\n\r\nA few miles further on they saw ahead of them, in the road, a man\r\ncovered with dust and dirt and hatless, running at full speed towards\r\nthem. They discovered that he was an emigrant, and that starvation had,\r\ndoubtless, made him partially insane. He was pursued and caught, and\r\nafter being fed he recovered sufficiently to be able to give his name.\r\nHe stated that a few miles back upon the road he had passed a woman,\r\nwith her husband, who was sick in the wagon, and with three or four\r\nyoung children.\r\n\r\n“The woman,” he said, “was frying over the fire a few little cakes, and\r\nI asked if she would give me one as I was starving. She said that she\r\nwould to save my life, but that those four little cakes were the last\r\nthat she had to divide among six of them. I told her that if that was\r\nthe case I would not rob her.”\r\n\r\nAnd from that time he stated that he seemed to lose all consciousness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHAT’S UP.]\r\n\r\nBy the afternoon of the second day out upon their charitable mission\r\nthe young men had distributed their supplies among the suffering, and\r\ncamped for the night at a spring near the road. Towards evening, as\r\nthey were sitting by their camp fire, they observed away across on the\r\nopposite side of a steep cañon, an animal of some kind, but owing to\r\nthe distance could not tell whether it was a horse, cow or bear. They\r\nfired several shots with their rifles in that direction, but without\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIt was about daylight the next morning when they were aroused from a\r\nsound sleep by a terrible noise and stampede among their horses. Upon\r\ninvestigation was discovered, at a short distance through the darkness,\r\nthe form of some animal which had very much the appearance of a huge\r\nbear, as they had often seen portrayed in their picture books when\r\nboys. They concluded not to investigate any further at present, but\r\nvied with each other to see who could climb up a tree the quickest. The\r\ngrizzly, for such it proved to be, was the strange animal seen upon\r\nthe flat across the cañon, and which they had been using for a target.\r\nInstigated by a similar feeling, presumably, and with an intense desire\r\nto see who the, to it, strange animals were upon the hill, it had\r\ntraveled up around the head of the cañon, a distance of about twelve\r\nmiles, to satisfy its curiosity and to see what was up, which it soon\r\nfound, on looking up among the limbs of a big pine tree.\r\n\r\nAfter devouring everything in sight that was eatable, as well, also,\r\nas many things which were not so much so, the grizzly cast its eyes up\r\ntowards the boys, and with a knowing wink hoped they would come that\r\nway often to practice target shooting, and departed.\r\n\r\nThe third night out, and on their way home, they camped at what was\r\nthen called “Leek Springs,” on the regular emigrant road. They picketed\r\ntheir horses as usual before retiring for the night, but found, to\r\ntheir astonishment in the morning, that the trusty steeds had been\r\nstolen. After tracking the animals for a few miles, they saw among the\r\ntall grass a large band of horses, well guarded by mounted Mexicans,\r\nwhich had been stolen from the emigrants for the two previous years.\r\n\r\nUpon arriving in town the facts were reported and an expedition started\r\nimmediately to capture the thieves, but too late, as the marauders were\r\non their way to Lower California, led by the noted bandit Joaquin, it\r\nwas supposed.\r\n\r\nA two-wheeled, covered cart, drawn by a very diminutive yoke of oxen,\r\nwhich passed through the town at this time created much amusement. It\r\nwas under the management of a stately Pike County dame. She was about\r\nfifty years of age, with long ringlets dangling from the sides of her\r\nhead, and was dressed in the latest and most approved style of bloomer\r\ncostume. As this stately dame marched with a dignified and majestic\r\ntread alongside of her team, carrying upon her shoulder the usual\r\nregulation Missouri ox gad, she presented a fine appearance, and as old\r\nMike (a venerable Greek) remarked:\r\n\r\n“Be jabers, thin, she reminds me of a Spartan mither with her chariot,\r\ndo yez see, searching upon the faild of battle for the bodies of her\r\nbrave b’ys!”\r\n\r\nIt was, however, a fair illustration of what it is even possible for a\r\nwoman to accomplish when she takes a notion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SPARTAN MOTHER.]\r\n\r\nThe road across the Sierra Nevada range of mountains, over which the\r\nemigrants were obliged to travel, in order to pass through Hangtown,\r\nwas called the old Tremont trail, and was a very rough road; crossing\r\ndeep cañons and rocky points, but a man by the name of Jack Johnson who\r\nwas accustomed to mountain travel and famous for opening new trails and\r\n“cut offs,” succeeded in the fall of ’49, or spring of ’50 rather, in\r\nfinding a much better, as well as a shorter trail, which the emigration\r\nof following years took advantage of. It was used for many years, and\r\nuniversally known as the “Johnson Cut off,” and, by the way, it was\r\nsupposed to save about thirty miles of travel.\r\n\r\nSome eighteen or twenty years subsequent to the finding of this trail,\r\nMr. Johnson had occasion to stop over night in Placerville, at the\r\nCary House, and occupied a room in the second story. He was tired and\r\nrestless, and awakening in the night, not knowing where he was, and\r\nseeing before him what he supposed was an open door, which was in fact\r\na French window opening to the floor, he walked out of this window,\r\nfalling to the ground below, and breaking an arm in the fall. An old\r\ntimer who was present, the next day with a piece of chalk wrote upon a\r\nboard, placing the latter against the building beneath the window:\r\n\r\n                       THE JOHNSON CUT OFF.\r\n\r\nBut the old timer was many years behind the time for such a joke to be\r\nunderstood and appreciated; for nearly twenty years had passed, and\r\nthe history of “Johnson’s Cut off” had long since been forgotten, or\r\nremembered only as a tradition; and all those who saw the sign, with a\r\ncouple of exceptions, asked what it meant. Becoming conscious at length\r\nthat even here, too, time was putting in its work, with a sad heart he\r\nremoved the board from its position, remarking to another old timer\r\nnear him:\r\n\r\n“Dan! the time alas, is drawing near when the boy will inquire of his\r\nfather:\r\n\r\n“‘Pa, what is an old forty-niner, anyhow? The school-teacher gave the\r\nconundrum to-day, for us to guess.’”\r\n\r\n“The father referring to Mark Twain; ‘Phœnix,’ the Argonauts of\r\nCalifornia,’ and numerous other ancient records will answer, that many\r\nlong years ago, a few adventurers from the Eastern States hearing\r\nthat here upon the Western Slope the discovery of the ancient site of\r\nParadise had been made, and that remnants of the richly paved streets\r\nof the New Jerusalem had also been found scattered over the country,\r\nventured forth in quest of this earthly Eden. They brought with them\r\nin their ships all the various tools, implements, and devices for\r\ncollecting together the scattered remnants of the holy pavement, and\r\ntradition states also, as well as from the fact that amidst the debris\r\nand ruins of an old edifice of some description in San Francisco was\r\nfound many years since a huge bear carved in stone, confirming the\r\ntradition that this was the site of an edifice erected by this race\r\nof people (the Forty-niners) and used as a place of resort for social\r\ngatherings, and as a means of keeping in remembrance those early days\r\nand perpetuating the names of the most prominent of those who took a\r\npart. And the inquisitive boy would probably ask:\r\n\r\n“‘Are the names of any of these yet remembered, Pa?’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ARGONAUT AND HIS MULE.]\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, but only one that I now remember of,’ the father would answer;\r\nfor it was the tradition that at that early period of time, a mule\r\nwas often seen wandering among the hills and cañons, going in various\r\ndirections, but without any apparent desire on the part of the frank\r\nand energetic looking Argonaut upon its back to go anywhere in\r\nparticular, only so he got there on time. ‘Tradition, my son, further\r\ntells us that this rider’s name was Pixley, and that he was probably\r\nhunting for some office.’”\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ the boy asks, ‘did he find it, Pa?’\r\n\r\n“‘Tradition tells us that he did later--a printing office.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well, Pa,’ the boy will again ask; ‘the name of the man who first\r\nfound the gold was known, wasn’t it?’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHIEF COOK.]\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, so it was supposed for many long years, and they even erected\r\na monument in Colomo to perpetuate his memory; but alas for the\r\nuncertainty of all human knowledge, an eccentric and ingenious\r\nindividual who made cyphers and oughts his study, made the discovery by\r\na peculiar combination of them, that the first person who discovered\r\ngold here in California was not a man, but a woman, who was engaged as\r\nchief cook for one of the Indian chiefs, and that she found it in the\r\ndinner pot. While cooking for her royal master a Shanghai chicken, the\r\nold chief noticed that it had a very yellow, sickly appearance, and\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n“‘Not muchee bellie good, alle same sick.’\r\n\r\n“‘And the cook, in searching for the cause, found a small fragment of\r\npavement imbedded in its gizzard. Holding it aloft with a triumphant\r\ngrin, she exclaimed to her royal lord and master:\r\n\r\n“‘Oh! go way wid ye now, ye ould hathen. Do yez moind this now? For\r\nshure, and ’tis mesilf that’s the first one to place me oi squarely\r\nupon the likes of this; a bit of the howly pavement and pure vargin\r\ngould. It is now, do yez moind?’\r\n\r\n“‘And this simple incident, my son, was the first foundation in the\r\nstructure of this great and glorious empire, California, where it was\r\nyour good fortune to first see the light of day.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well, it was funny, wasn’t it, Pa? for the books tell us that one\r\nempire in the olden times was saved by a goose, and here is another one\r\nfounded by a Shanghai rooster.’\r\n\r\n“Daniel, let us enter in yonder open doorway, lean upon the bar, and\r\nweep.”\r\n\r\nThey immediately did forthwith enter therein; and leaning sadly upon\r\nthe bar, did--smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nSICKNESS IN THE MINES--EARTHQUAKES--THE STEAMBOAT MEN--A MINERS’\r\nMEETING--LUCKY BILL--KIT CARSON--THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE\r\nMINERS--AUSTRALIAN MIKE AND HIS TIN CAN--PORTUGUESE JO--THE\r\nDIVINING-ROD.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch sickness prevailed among the mining classes, caused, as was\r\ngenerally believed, by the very unhealthy climate; but which, in\r\nfact, can be better attributed to their habits, mode of life, and\r\nintemperance in eating as well as in drinking. Typhoid and bilious\r\nfevers were the usual complaints, from which many died. One fact\r\nwas remarkable in relation to those who suffered from the various\r\ndiseases at this time, which was that those among whom the sickness\r\nand mortality were greatest were, as a general rule, the most robust\r\nand able-bodied men. The explanation doubtless is that the healthy,\r\nstrong and able-bodied men were more careless in their habits and mode\r\nof life; placed less restraint upon their appetites, and therefore\r\nsuffered the consequences. Those, on the other hand, of a weaker\r\nphysique were more careful of their habits, took better care of\r\nthemselves, and therefore suffered but little from disease, proving the\r\npossibility that even the invalid, under proper conditions and in the\r\nuse of his reasoning faculties, may be long-lived.\r\n\r\nAt this period, also, great numbers returned to their Eastern homes,\r\nbelieving this to be the most unhealthy climate of any portion of\r\nthe continent, and one where no Northern or Eastern man could dwell\r\nin safety, in consequence of the duration of the long, dry seasons\r\nwhich in some years continued for a space of eight and ten months (as\r\nwe were informed), when not a cloud obscured the sun or not a drop\r\nof rain fell. It was also feared that the necessaries of life could\r\nnot be raised from the soil. For this reason it was thought that any\r\ninterference with the communication by water between this and the East\r\nor other portions of the earth would cause great inconvenience and\r\nsuffering among the residents of the mining regions. But one of the\r\ngreatest dangers which, as we were informed, we would be compelled to\r\nencounter in this new and unsettled country, and from which there was\r\nno possible escape, was the destructive earthquake. The Indians told us\r\nthat they were so frequent some years that the hills and mountains were\r\nin almost constant motion. The squaws, they asserted, took advantage\r\nof the fact by suspending their papooses from stakes driven into the\r\nground, and the gentle swaying of the hills during the continuance of\r\nthe earthquakes would rock the latter to sleep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PAPOOSE LULLABY.]\r\n\r\nThat diseases should prevail at this time seems paradoxical, for great\r\nadditions had been made during the past few months to the medical\r\nfraternity, in this portion of the mining regions, at least, by the\r\narrival of Drs. Ruddock, Chamberlain, Baker, Smith, Harvey, Cook,\r\nKeane, Burnham, Hall, Van Vleck, Marshal, Titus, Childs, Foster,\r\nShober, and a few others whose names I have forgotten. These, in\r\nconjunction with those of an earlier date of arrival, constituted a\r\nformidable array of medical talent that was competent to battle with\r\nand to resist the destructive effects of all diseases. They failed in\r\nmany cases, however; but whether owing to the very unhealthy nature\r\nof the climate, or want of skill in the fraternity, would be perhaps\r\ndifficult to decide.\r\n\r\nA story is told in relation to one of these physicians, and is worth\r\nrelating, from the fact that one of the principal actors is, at the\r\npresent time, a resident of San Francisco, and can be seen occasionally\r\naround the wharves, or on board of one of the various steamers,\r\nalthough his occupation is gone and the Colonel has outlived his\r\nusefulness.\r\n\r\nDr. Ruddock had built a house upon Stony Point, and was about getting\r\nready to move into it, when he found one evening, to his astonishment,\r\nthat a company of emigrants, which had just arrived from St. Louis,\r\nhad jumped his premises and refused to give up possession. They were\r\nfive in number and were steamboat runners from St. Louis. Complaint was\r\nmade to Mr. Wallace, the Justice, and Alex. Hunter, the Constable was\r\nordered to eject them. Returning to the office again in a few minutes\r\nhe reported that the parties who had jumped the Doctor’s house didn’t\r\neject “worth a cuss.” He was then authorized to raise a posse for the\r\npurpose, which he did, but only to be laughed at by the house jumpers,\r\nand he was forced under the circumstances to make a similar report\r\nto headquarters, and furthermore that they positively declared that\r\n“there wasn’t Yanks enough in Hangtown to drive them out, either.” But\r\nit happened just at this crisis that Col. Rogers, our recently elected\r\nsheriff, rode into town, and was made acquainted with the trouble, and\r\nrequested by the Judge to raise a posse and drive the intruders out.\r\nThe Sheriff remarked that he would attend to the little affair at once,\r\nbut that he considered himself posse enough for the business. Upon his\r\narrival at the house he found the door fastened, and upon demanding\r\nadmission he was ordered off, and he went off--about four feet--when he\r\nreturned again with full force against the door which gave way with a\r\ncrash, and he followed it into the room.\r\n\r\nAs he entered he saw standing near the door a number of rifles.\r\nSeizing one of these, he cocked it, and aiming it at the nearest man\r\nhe demanded an instant evacuation of the premises, which followed\r\nimmediately in the easiest and quickest manner possible, without regard\r\nto order, method or manner of going, their chief desire being\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STEAMBOAT RUNNERS.]\r\n\r\nto get out. The windows in the rear being more convenient and easy\r\nof exit, the five steamboat runners, with the valiant Colonel in the\r\nrear, tumbled out in the quickest manner possible, under a full head of\r\nsteam, with a velocity of about two miles per minute, and were not able\r\nto pull up until they had reached the next landing, a few miles below\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nI have before mentioned that there were very many hard characters who\r\ncame into the mines at this season. Among them were the famous and\r\nnotorious Pike County Missourians, many of whom, however, were men of\r\ngood character. A greater portion of them, it is true, were just the\r\nreverse, a reputation which they enjoyed for many years; so that to\r\ncharge a man with being from Pike County was an insult to be resented.\r\nMany of this class engaged in mining if they could by any means get\r\npossession of a good-paying claim without the necessity of hunting for\r\nit. The consequence was that a goodly number of them were occasionally\r\ninjured through their taking possession of claims which they had no\r\nright to, and miners’ meetings were frequently called to drive these\r\nclaim jumpers from misappropriated ground.\r\n\r\nTwo young men discovered a rich lead upon a low divide near the head\r\nof Big Cañon, a few miles from town, and upon going out to work\r\none morning they found that four of these claim jumpers had taken\r\npossession of their ground and had removed their stakes, placing\r\ntheir own instead. The young men called a miners’ meeting, and the\r\nday following about fifty miners answered the call, and organized\r\nby electing a chairman. After due investigation it was decided that\r\nthese young men owned the ground in dispute, and that the jumpers\r\nmust pull up their stakes and vacate. The jumpers, however, made no\r\ndefense, remarking only after the decision was rendered against them,\r\nthat they would like to see the man who would pull up their stakes,\r\nat the same time drawing their weapons. There was a young man present\r\nas a spectator who had not taken any part in the meeting, although\r\ninterested in the proceedings. This young man drew his gun, and\r\nstepping out from the crowd said to the jumpers:\r\n\r\n“You would like to see the man who will pull up your stakes? Well, you\r\ncan,” at the same time pulling them up and throwing them to one side,\r\nand placing the young men in possession of their claim.\r\n\r\nThis young man was Dave Buell, who was afterwards elected as the County\r\nSheriff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MINER’S MEETING.]\r\n\r\nThe Autumn rains commenced about the first of November, raining,\r\nhowever, but slightly during the fall and winter of ’50 and ’51, and\r\nbeing the most remarkable winter ever experienced either before or\r\nafter, in that section. The only rain of any consequence fell in the\r\nmonth of April following. Miners, who had thrown up piles of dirt, were\r\nbadly disappointed in not being able to wash it, and gold mining was\r\nvoted a fraud. Nothing occurred during the winter to break the monotony\r\nof events, and Hangtown and vicinity were again nearly deserted. News\r\nfrom the North and South of the discovery of rich river mining, as well\r\nas new placer mining, continued to be received, showing that the mining\r\nregion was gradually being extended to nearly the whole length of the\r\nState, although but a few miles in breadth. One other fact, also, was\r\nbeing well demonstrated, and that was that although millions of dollars\r\nwere being washed from the river bars and dry diggings in the mining\r\nregions, yet the greater portion of it, through regular as well as\r\nirregular business channels, was being concentrated in the hands of the\r\nbusiness men in San Francisco; the miners, as a class, retaining but a\r\nsmall proportion of their earnings, and in many cases barely sufficient\r\nto sustain life.\r\n\r\nThe gambling fraternity became now in the fall and winter of ’50 more\r\nnumerous, and were in full blast in our heretofore rather quiet and\r\norderly town.\r\n\r\nFighting was a pastime, and shooting, upon the slightest provocation,\r\nwas one of the chief amusements.\r\n\r\nThe miners lost large amounts of gold dust at the gambling tables,\r\nand in the endeavor to get even still continued to lose. The noted\r\nthimble-rigger, “Lucky Bill,” and the three-card monte sharpers of St.\r\nLouis were on the top round of glory, robbing the honest miners who\r\nfrom curiosity put up their money to know how the thing was done, and\r\nthey always found out.\r\n\r\nThis man, “Lucky Bill,” alias Wm. Thornton, was a gambler by\r\nprofession, born and raised in the city of St. Louis. Although a man\r\nof very bad character, yet there is placed to his credit on the great\r\nregister certain acts of a charitable nature that could hardly be\r\nexpected from such an individual. He was always ready to assist the\r\nneedy, and when money was required for the unfortunate had been known\r\nto contribute hundreds of dollars at a single time. He was hung by\r\na vigilance committee in Carson Valley a few years later for being\r\nimplicated in a murder and cattle stealing scrape.\r\n\r\nIn his address to the spectators around the place of his execution,\r\nhe stated that he could blame no one for the course they had taken\r\nin condemning him to suffer death, for he well knew that he really\r\ndeserved it, but, continued he:\r\n\r\n“How could anything else be expected of a man who was raised and\r\nbrought up by his parents among the criminal class found in the slums\r\nand back alleys of all large cities, or more particularly in St. Louis,\r\nwhere I was born. If I had been raised in a different manner I should,\r\nno doubt, have been a far better man.”\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, he advised his son, who was present, to avoid bad\r\ncompany, to keep away from saloons, and to live an honest and\r\nindustrious life.\r\n\r\nHis address illustrates very aptly the force of habits acquired by\r\nassociation in early life, as well as such inherited conditions which\r\nare natural to the individual; they form a part of him, and, under\r\nordinary circumstances, cannot be avoided or overcome.\r\n\r\nSunday was a general holiday for the miners, and early upon this day\r\nthey could be seen, dressed in store clothes, when fortunate enough to\r\nhave any, coming from the various gulches and ravines towards the town\r\nto see the sights and amusements to be found in the saloons and in the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nThe amusements upon the street consisted principally of horse racing,\r\nrunning, jumping, wrestling, an occasional fight, as well as shooting\r\nat targets with rifle and pistol. One of the best shots with the rifle\r\nwas a descendant of Daniel Boone, of Kentucky, who was remarkably\r\nexpert. Kit Carson, who also had recently arrived, would display his\r\ndexterity with the pistol in shooting through the hub of a wagon wheel\r\nas it was being rolled across the street, a piece of paper having been\r\npasted over the hub previously. Gambling was, of course, indulged in to\r\na great extent by many miners, some of them losing the result of their\r\nwhole week’s work, in some cases amounting to hundreds of dollars. The\r\nman who dealt the three-card French monte game was a great attraction,\r\nfor his simple game looked or seemed “so innocent and aisy to bate,\r\ndoes yez see now,” said an Irish miner; but this was only apparent,\r\nas all those who attempted to beat the game became convinced, for it\r\nwas soon found that the game was a regular swindling operation, being\r\nafterwards abolished entirely by the miners, and the dealer driven from\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nA miner on Sunday, for amusement bet on a certain card, throwing down\r\nhis purse of gold, which contained about $800. Singularly enough\r\nhe won; the dealer, however, discovering the mistake he had made,\r\nattempted to change the card. Failing to do so without detection, he\r\nflatly refused to pay the bet. A short consultation among the miners\r\ndecided as to how he should be served. A rope was thrown around his\r\nneck, and fifteen minutes allowed him in which to “pungle down the\r\ndust.” He called upon his brother gamblers to come to his assistance,\r\nwhich they were inclined to do, but they were very politely informed\r\nby the miners, that after settling with the monte dealer, it was the\r\nintention to hang a few of them also, if they did not leave town within\r\ntwo hours. The monte dealer concluded that he had struck a hard crowd,\r\npaid the bet and vanished. A few of the other gamblers departed also,\r\nbut returned again, however, in a few days.\r\n\r\nIt is proper and but just that I should mention here the vast\r\nimprovement in the make-up and general appearance of the great majority\r\nof the mining class since the arrival of the fall emigration of ’50.\r\nSunday would find them dressed in their “biled shirts” and “store\r\nclothes,” with hair and whiskers well trimmed and faces shaved, and\r\noccasionally a stove-pipe hat would make its appearance. The appearance\r\nof the tile was seldom repeated, however, for the trouble of forcing\r\nit up over the face again where it had been jammed down by some vile\r\nscoundrel, “just for fun you know,” and of again putting it into proper\r\nshape, took away all pleasure in wearing it. The fact is, the miners\r\nwho had been living for the past year away from those conditions which\r\ncivilized society creates, had not as yet arrived at that point again,\r\nor to that advanced condition where the style of a plug hat would be\r\nappreciated; consequently, the man who was ignorant of this fact, and\r\nhad the audacity to appear in the streets with such an absurd head\r\ngear, had to suffer the consequences.\r\n\r\nIt may at this point in the history of mining be of some interest to\r\nknow the financial condition of those who had been engaged in the\r\nbusiness for the past year. As before stated, many returned to their\r\nEastern homes in the spring, a few of them with a considerable amount\r\nof gold dust, and some having as much as $10,000 and even $15,000, but\r\nin very many cases with barely sufficient to pay their way. A few,\r\nagain, who had succeeded in securing a fair amount, would engage in\r\nbusiness in some one of the mining camps, or in Sacramento City or San\r\nFrancisco, whilst others would buy land in some portion of the State\r\nand engage in the stock business. But those miners who remained in this\r\nportion of the mining region were, as a general rule, those who had not\r\nacquired a sufficient amount to satisfy them, and therefore determined\r\nto remain until they did. Others again, desired very much to return to\r\ntheir families, but not having the means were compelled to remain.\r\n\r\nThere were a few persons here who had accumulated a large amount of\r\ndust, and one man by the name of Harper, who never was known to wear a\r\nhat, a Scotchman by birth, is said to have accumulated about $75,000.\r\nAnother one from Australia, but an Irishman by birth, who arrived in\r\nthe mines early in the spring of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONLY TWO DAYS IN THE MINES.]\r\n\r\n’49, is said to have been a very lucky miner, as the saying goes, and\r\nhad about $60,000 which he had put into empty oyster cans and hidden\r\naround in various places, to which fact hangs a tale.\r\n\r\nSeveral instances had occurred where persons had come into the mines\r\nand by a streak of good fortune been successful, or in other words had\r\n“struck it rich,” and returned home again in a very short time. Among\r\nthis number of very lucky ones, were two young men who had just arrived\r\nfrom their homes in the East. On the second day of their arrival in\r\nHangtown, they were directed by an aquaintance to the big cañon a\r\nshort distance north of town as being a good place to commence their\r\noperations, they dug a ditch down the side hill from the main ditch,\r\nin order to run the water into their sluices; and while at work a tin\r\ncan was found in their sluices, which had been washed out from the\r\nloose soil above near the roots of an old oak tree, and had by the\r\nforce of the water rolled down into the sluice. Upon examination, they\r\nfound it full of gold dust and their work was done in California. They\r\nhad found what they had come for, and the next morning were aboard\r\nthe stage bound for San Francisco, with $15,000 worth of gold dust to\r\ndivide between them. Australian Mike lived very near the spot, and\r\nthe next day discovered his loss. An officer in pursuit of the young\r\nchaps arrived in San Francisco about two hours only, which however was\r\nenough, after the steamer had left the wharf for Panama, on which they\r\nhad taken passage. Old Mike did’nt seem to care much for the loss, and\r\nall he said was: “Be jabers, thin, I hev a plinty more handy, do ye\r\nmoind?”\r\n\r\nPeople at the East often asked the question, and wondered why it was\r\nthat so many returned again to their homes without having succeeded in\r\nmaking but very little in the gold mines, while others returned with\r\nfortunes. This seemed strange, and was often attributed to bad habits,\r\nintemperance or laziness, which, of course, was true in many cases but\r\nnot in all, by any means. It is very true that the industrious man\r\nwho worked early and late would, from the nature of things, be more\r\nsuccessful than those who did the reverse or worked but seldom; and\r\nalthough this rule will apply to all human affairs in general, yet\r\nthe mining industry in early days was, to some extent, at least, an\r\nexception to the accepted rule, for, as observation shows us, it was\r\nnot the hardest-working man, or the most industrious, who succeeded\r\nbest in striking the richest placers,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHO ARE THE SUCCESSFUL PROSPECTORS.]\r\n\r\nbut in very many instances fortune favored those who did the least\r\nwork. In the ordinary affairs of life those only will prosper or\r\nsucceed in the business in which they are engaged, who are well\r\nqualified, and who possess the qualities and habits necessary for\r\nits success--that is to say, possessing a reasonable amount of\r\nintelligence, economy, industry, and proper caution; but in mining,\r\nthese qualities are, so far as the finding and extraction of the gold\r\nis concerned, of very little value, as was often illustrated in early\r\nmining days.\r\n\r\nI do not include, however, in this class those who were too lazy to\r\nmake an effort to find a paying mine, for the country was full of this\r\nclass of men, and they could be seen tramping about among the numerous\r\nhills and gulches with their tools, hunting for some pleasant spot to\r\nwork, and they would generally find it under the shade of a tree. It\r\nwas this class of men who depended upon their more industrious friends\r\nfor a living, and who were always ready to maintain that mining in\r\nearly days was a mere question of luck.\r\n\r\nVery often the most ignorant, idle and shiftless lout, would stumble\r\nby accident upon a very rich gold deposit. The colored individual, and\r\nthe sailor too, who had run away from his ship, as well as many others\r\nof like ilk, had just as good an opportunity, and were as competent\r\nto find a valuable gold deposit, as the most highly educated college\r\nstudent or scientific geologist. In mining, but little judgment was\r\nrequired, and a little experience, which was soon acquired, brought all\r\nupon an equal footing. If gold had been scattered equally and uniformly\r\nthroughout the land, then only those would be the most successful who\r\nwere the most industrious; but this was not the case, however, for\r\n’twas scattered all over only in spots, and it was the dropping upon\r\nthese spots by accident that determined the success of the individual.\r\nIt was often the case that persons were hard at work realizing daily\r\nbut a few dollars, whilst a few feet away others were making perhaps\r\nhundreds of dollars per diem, and many again who to my knowledge were\r\nquite industrious barely made a living. That a few made large sums,\r\nwhilst others again made but little, must therefore be attributed to\r\ntheir good fortune, or to their having, from chance conditions, located\r\ntheir claim and worked upon the right spot. In my opinion no other\r\nexplanation can be given, or why a few were enabled to make large sums\r\nwhile others, equally industrious, realized but little.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LUCKY STAR.]\r\n\r\nFor instance a sailor, who had just arrived from San Francisco, having\r\ndeserted from his ship, strolled along up the creek one day where two\r\nminers were hard at work, and he stood silently watching them for a\r\nfew minutes. Then transferring his cud of tobacco across from port to\r\nstarboard, he remarked, in a coarse salt-water, tone of voice:\r\n\r\n“Well shipmates, what’s the show for a fellow here, anyhow?”\r\n\r\nThey pointed out a vacant spot of ground a short distance above (near\r\nwhat is now called Cedar Ravine) and borrowing the necessary tools,\r\nJack was soon at hard work.\r\n\r\nTowards evening he returned again, and said that he didn’t know\r\nanything about the blasted bed rock, gold, or anything else, and wanted\r\nthe shipmates to go and take a look at the blasted thing. They went to\r\nhis claim and found it about five feet long and about three feet in\r\nwidth and four feet in depth. Near the center it was about six inches\r\ndeeper, and in this depression, which was very rich, they washed out\r\nwith their cradles for Jack in two hours about $3,500. He was only\r\ntwo days in the mines, for of course he returned to San Francisco\r\nimmediately to enjoy himself.\r\n\r\nQuite a number of similar instances might be given in elucidation of\r\nthe fact as I have explained it, and if you wish for good luck in\r\nmining, always put in your time right where gold is, and nowhere else.\r\n\r\nAnother instance in illustration of the fact that Dame Fortune is\r\nimpartial in the distribution of her favors was that of Portuguese\r\nJoe, a sailor who came up into the mines from San Francisco early in\r\nthe spring of ’50. After working around for a few weeks in various\r\nlocalities with but poor success, he concluded to do a little\r\nprospecting in some less frequented locality. Purchasing a diminutive\r\ndonkey, he packed the animal with all necessary tools and supplies\r\nand wandered forth. It was not long, however, before he returned to\r\npurchase further supplies, and it was surmised from the size and weight\r\nof his sack that he had struck it rich. But where? Not a word could\r\nbe gotten from him, however. He was followed a number of times, but,\r\nsuspecting it, would go miles out of his way upon his return to deceive\r\nthem. But Yankee ingenuity could not be foiled by a Portuguese sailor;\r\nand one dark night, when he had started to his camp upon the donkey,\r\ntwo old miners followed his trail. The donkey and its rider suspected\r\nthis, and consequently traveled nearly all night around among the\r\nhills, through rocky ravines and dark cañons, but only to find to their\r\ngreat astonishment, when, as they slid down the side of a steep hill\r\nnear the dawn of day and landed upon a small bar upon the South Fork of\r\nthe American River, that closely following them and sliding down the\r\ndeep descent in their rear, were the two old miners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON HIS TRAIL.]\r\n\r\nWell, Joe was a good-natured fellow, and was rather glad of their\r\ncompany, for the bar was very rich and large enough for all. They\r\nfound, on investigation, upon the richest part of the bar the sand and\r\ngravel was only from six inches to a foot in depth, and that the gold\r\nwas coarse and easily found in the crevices of the slate bed rock,\r\nand from this time forward it was called “Portuguese Joe’s Bar.” How\r\nmuch this Portuguese sailor took from his bar was never exactly known,\r\nalthough it was estimated to be about $60,000; nor of his ultimate\r\nend, for, alas, his was a sad ending, and of the incidents, being an\r\neye-witness, I have at this late day a very vivid recollection.\r\n\r\nDuring one of his frequent visits into Hangtown, astride of his\r\ndiminutive donkey with his feet dangling upon the ground, for he was\r\na very tall man, upon passing along through the noisy street, for it\r\nwas Sunday, the affectionate animal, either from accident or fun, very\r\nsuddenly elevated that portion of his anatomy abaft the saddle, and\r\nthe rider was thrown forward upon the cold ground. Assisting him again\r\nto his feet, a bystander, in a very careless although innocent manner\r\nwithout the least design to injure or desire to harm anyone, remarked\r\nthat Joe reminded him very much of Cæsar, since both had been placed\r\nunder similar circumstances. Upon being asked why, in the hearing of\r\nJoe, he answered that they both fell by a brute ass (Brutus). Joe gazed\r\nsadly upon the thoughtless miscreant to see if he was in dead earnest\r\nor only intended it as a joke, and being satisfied that it was no joke,\r\nhe strode sadly astride of his beast which he sat down upon, turned his\r\nhead toward the setting sun and departed never to return again.\r\n\r\nThis vile attempt to destroy the peace and happiness of a fellow-being\r\nin the eyes of the miners was equivalent to manslaughter, and a jury\r\nbeing immediately formed the culprit was arraigned before the bar (in\r\nthe nearest saloon), received his sentence, the fine being very heavy,\r\nas the jury was numerous and very dry.\r\n\r\nBut what became of Portuguese Joe was never known. It is said that\r\naway off in Europe, amidst the dense forest in the German Empire was\r\noccasionally seen by the superstitious peasants the phantom of a\r\ndonkey, and riding on his back a tall, dark and sad-eyed rider, going\r\nin the direction of Rome; and they positively assert that after he\r\nhad passed they could distinctly hear the gentle breeze, as it moved\r\nslightly among the trees, sadly murmur. Oh, Cæsar! Oh, Cæsar! This\r\nin all probability was Portuguese Joe from Hangtown, Eldorado County,\r\nCalifornia, who, not having previously heard of Cæsar’s accident, was\r\ndoubtless on his way to see if the latter was much hurt by his fall.\r\n\r\nThe location of the right spot to dig is the great problem to solve\r\nin mining, and many devices were, adopted for the purpose, among\r\nthem being the divining-rod, frequently used by our associates from\r\nthe Faderland. One German had established an office, and in his\r\nprospectus agreed to furnish, for a consideration, the exact location\r\nwhere gold deposits could be found; but upon trial, to his vexation\r\nand astonishment, found that it was useless. A newcomer engaged his\r\nservices, and the spot was located near the banks of a ravine near by.\r\nThe bed rock was slate and very hard, but the German fakir stated that\r\ndown under the rock was a great deposit of gold, and he only charged\r\nthe verdant youth the sum of $25 for the valuable information. After\r\nspending much time and money, as well as a great deal of hard work, in\r\npenetrating the slate bed to the distance of about thirty feet, the\r\nproject was abandoned, and the German, with his rod of divination, also\r\nabandoned the mines in disgust. These fabulous instruments, usually\r\nmade of sticks cut from a witch-hazel bush in our own country, in\r\nGermany are made of whalebone, and to one which I saw was fastened a\r\nsmall vial containing quicksilver, in which was found a piece of paper\r\nupon which was written in some foreign language certain mythical words\r\nand signs, evidently from the Bible, meaning, I suppose, “excavate and\r\nye shall find,” or an extract from Job, “Watch the pot and it will\r\nnever bile,” or something similar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nWHERE THE RICH PLACERS WERE FOUND--MINERS’ SUPERSTITION--THE BLUE CLAY\r\nDEPOSIT--GOLD MACHINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt might be of some interest to those who engage in mining, as well\r\nas for others, to know where were found the richest gold deposits by\r\nthe first miners, or, rather, what were considered as the richest\r\nravines or cañons, in the central portion of the mining regions or\r\ndry diggings, as they were called. Previous to the arrival of the\r\nemigration of ’49, those who happened to be in the country, as well\r\nas the Mormon element which rushed into the mines from Salt Lake upon\r\nhearing of the gold discovery, and those also who came from Oregon,\r\nmade their way immediately to the vicinity of Coloma, where gold\r\nwas first discovered. But little placer mining was found in this\r\nvicinity, and the gold seekers wandered off in various directions. In\r\nthe vicinity of Georgetown and Kelsey, rich mines among the hills and\r\nravines were found, the dry diggings around Hangtown being discovered\r\nabout March 1 by parties from Oregon. The first discovery was made in\r\nHangtown Creek, near the mouth of Cedar Ravine, the latter being the\r\nfirst ravine worked, and found to be very rich, yielding upwards of\r\n$1,000,000. The next discovery was in Bedford Avenue, at that time\r\ncalled “Log Cabin Ravine,” and a large amount of gold was taken from\r\nit by the two Winslow brothers, who first discovered it, and also by a\r\nMr. Rider who took home with him about $25,000. From this ravine had\r\nbeen taken altogether, as near as can be determined, about $250,000.\r\nThe richest portion of the creek was from a point below the mouth of\r\nCedar Ravine down to a point near the foundry. Below this again but\r\nvery little gold was found. In ascending the creek, good wages were\r\nmade above Cedar Ravine, and a few very good deposits were found nearly\r\nup to the store of Dr. Price. From that point up, but little gold was\r\never found, although a few spots paid fair wages. The creek was worked\r\nin ’49 and up to the autumn of ’51 by the usual process of sinking of\r\nholes and cradling the gravel upon the bed rock. Spots in the creek,\r\nespecially in the rear of the court house, were found to be very\r\nrich, and a piece of ground in the rear of Adam’s Hotel (afterwards\r\nthe Mount Joy Hotel) was worked in ’49 and up to the spring of ’50 by\r\nFish Brothers and Co., from which they realized, as they stated, about\r\n$20,000.\r\n\r\nJust below Adams’ Hotel was a round tent used as a saloon and gambling\r\nhouse by Tom Ashton, in the winter of ’49. Immediately in the rear of\r\nthis tent, a man by the name of Wiley, in the spring of ’50, from one\r\npan of white clay washed out the sum of $1,400. A singular fact noticed\r\nand commented upon in ’49 was, that from about this point in the creek\r\ndown, but very little gold was ever found. The cause of this was not\r\ndiscovered until near the spring of ’50, when it was found that the\r\noriginal creek which deposited the gold made a turn at this point,\r\nrunning down under the buildings and crossing the street about opposite\r\nthe grocery store belonging to A. W. Bee, continued down through town\r\non the opposite side of the street, being confined in its course to\r\na narrow channel until reaching nearly to the Cary House. From this\r\npoint, no regular channel was ever found; but the gold was found\r\nscattered over the flats below. This flat was worked principally during\r\n’49 and the summer of ’50. The old channel running through and under\r\nthe town has all been worked with pan and cradle, and found to be very\r\nrich in places; and would pay well with sluices, but not in my opinion\r\nhalf as well as many imagine, for there is no gold to speak of in the\r\nmain street, except perhaps a very narrow spot on the Plaza, where the\r\nold creek crossed.\r\n\r\nThe amount of gold extracted from the creek altogether, including the\r\nflat below, as near as I was able to judge, was about $800,000. It was\r\ngenerally known how much miners were realizing from their claims, yet\r\nthere were certain ones who kept it a secret, these generally being\r\nthose who had the richest mines. Emigrant Ravine paid fair wages nearly\r\nup to the head of it, and a few smaller ravines emptying into it, also\r\npaid well. Going north from town across the Big Cañon to Poverty Point\r\nand its vicinity, many rich ravines were found; but the richest gold\r\ndeposit was reserved for the miners of ’50. This was the celebrated\r\nRed Hill, of decomposed quartz deposit lead, found upon the apex of a\r\nslate ledge crossing three different ravines, and running down towards\r\nthe Big Cañon. This lead was about an eight of a mile in length, and\r\nin some places only about three inches in width; yet over $250,000 was\r\ntaken from it. The very richest ravine that was discovered up to this\r\ntime, the spring of ’51, around Hangtown, was the Oregon Ravine. This\r\nravine was first discovered by two men from Oregon named Yocum. They\r\nfirst worked a narrow strip up through the ravine about three feet in\r\nwidth, and were at work at the time of our arrival in Hangtown, about\r\nthe 1st of October. We had consequently an opportunity of forming some\r\nidea of its richness. Their method of working was of the most primitive\r\nkind. One would with pick and shovel remove the dirt from the surface\r\nto near the bed rock, which was about three feet in depth, and the\r\nother, with an old knife or a sharp stick in one hand, would stir up\r\nthe dirt, and as the bright pieces of gold showed themselves, would\r\npick them up and drop them into a tin cup, which he constantly carried\r\nin the other hand.\r\n\r\nThis was their slow method of working, and although they realized a\r\nfortune by this process, they did not glean as much as they should have\r\ndone. How much these two men realized was never known, for they were\r\nvery cautious; but it was supposed that they took home with them about\r\n$100,000 each.\r\n\r\nOld man Harper, who also worked in this ravine, was said to have made\r\nout $60,000; several others also, have made large profits here. They\r\nall left for home in the fall of ’49.\r\n\r\nSoon after my arrival, there were at least 200 men at work in this\r\nravine, and all doing well, for the ravine was wide and paid richly\r\nfrom bank to bank. Dr. Ober was very successful, and as he passed along\r\ndown at night among the miners who were at work below him, with a\r\nsmiling countenance showed his tin cup in which he carried his gold. I\r\nfound that about $150 was his average day’s work. In my opinion, Oregon\r\nRavine yielded at least $1,000,000 if not more, and considering its\r\nsize was the richest one in this portion of the country.\r\n\r\nIn Spanish Ravine also was found a rich lead which continued up for a\r\nshort distance from its mouth, and which was worked out in the summer\r\nof ’49. As we go to the east a few very rich spots were round near\r\nSmith’s Flat, one small ravine in particular near the Emigrant Road,\r\nand only thirty yards in length, yielded about $13,000. At the small\r\ntown of Newtown, which was located about six miles nearly due east of\r\nPlacerville, and upon the eastern edge of the gold-bearing district,\r\nfrom a small ravine, during the winter of ’49, was taken by a company\r\nof four men the sum of $64,000.\r\n\r\nWeaver Creek upon the south was also very rich in many places, all\r\nincluded, however, in a distance of about four miles. Many small\r\nravines emptying into it were also found to be very rich. Of the many\r\ncañons in the County of Eldorado, which were prospected and worked\r\nin the winter of ’49-’50, there was but one which was noted for its\r\nmineral wealth. This was Georgetown Cañon, from which it was estimated\r\nthat fully $2,000,000 were taken up to the spring of ’53. Whether\r\nthis is a correct estimate or not I cannot say, although this was the\r\nestimate of a miner who worked there for about two years, and returned\r\nto the East in the autumn of ’52 with about $20,000 as his portion of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThere were also numerous small ravines emptying into all of these\r\nlarger ones and the cañon which contributed their quota to the general\r\nfund, besides numerous flats, slides and benches, which however, were\r\nworked at a later day. The Big Cañon, two miles north of town, was in\r\nsome portions of it very rich, and a few places were worked in ’49; but\r\nthe greater portion, or rather the richer portion of it, near the head,\r\nwas worked with toms, in the spring and winter of ’50-’51. The cañons\r\nlying at the east of this were not very rich, although one portion of\r\nWhite Rock Cañon worked in the winter of ’49-’50 by O’Brien, Grayson,\r\nStuart and Dayton, was very rich. The South Fork of the American River,\r\nas well as the numerous bars upon it, was not noted for its paying\r\nqualities, although some few rich deposits were found. Upon Kanaka Bar\r\na rich lead was discovered, which yielded many thousands. One beautiful\r\nnugget was found upon this bar which was valued at $1,010; but by far\r\nthe richest bar upon the whole river was that belonging to Portuguese\r\nJoe, from which he realized a fortune.\r\n\r\nAs we advance to the north we find that a few rich places were\r\ndiscovered around Coloma, at Kelsey’s, Spanish Flat, Greenwood Camp,\r\nand in the vicinity of Georgetown.\r\n\r\nEarly in ’49 the country and rivers as far north as the Yuba River was\r\nexamined and prospected, a few of the bars upon the latter being worked\r\nand found to be very rich.\r\n\r\nFortunes were realized from Spanish, Murderers’, Big and Michigan Bars,\r\nwhere Ex-Governor Stanford had his little store in ’52, the germ from\r\nwhich sprang the Great Overland Railroad.\r\n\r\nIn one respect Eldorado County differed from nearly all other mining\r\ncounties in the State, or even upon the Coast, as the gold was more\r\nevenly scattered and the mines, as a general rule, were more shallow\r\nand much more easily worked. For these reasons they paid better for the\r\ntime expended in working them, though naturally worked out much quicker.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the first discovery of gold having been made in\r\nEldorado County the first mining was confined to this portion of the\r\nmining regions, and for this reason also the yield of gold during the\r\nfirst two years subsequent to its discovery was greater than from any\r\npart of the State, the amount realized from the county up to the spring\r\nof ’51 having been estimated at $20,000,000.\r\n\r\nAs we advance to the north we find that the gold deposits in the\r\nravines and cañons are much deeper, and although gold upon the bed\r\nrock can be had in great quantities, being in some cases taken out\r\nby the pound, yet the net profits are very small, owing to the great\r\nexpense in working. For instance, in Cœur d’Alene gold mining region\r\nthe gravel upon some of the richest creek bottoms is from 20 to 30\r\nfeet in depth, while upon the bed rock there are rich deposits from\r\nwhich very coarse gold and nuggets have been taken by the pound. Yet\r\nthe great disadvantage and expense of working many of these places in\r\nconsequence of the amount of water to contend with, as well as the want\r\nof sufficient fall of same, make them unprofitable.\r\n\r\nIn the Caribou County, creeks were discovered of fabulous richness, yet\r\nsuch is the depth of gravel, in some cases upwards of 60 feet, that the\r\nexpense of working in many instances exceeded the income.\r\n\r\nWe find, also, as we proceed to the north, that the ancient river beds\r\nare of greater extent and much richer, the mountains also being higher\r\nand more rugged. The placer mining, on the other hand, is confined to\r\na smaller area, gold being found only in a few of the principal, or\r\nlarger, creeks and ravines.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, from this fact, as well as from the general\r\nappearance of the hills, that those natural forces, such as volcanic\r\nand glacial action, which wore away the high mountain peaks to their\r\npresent altitude, and which broke down the ancient river channels\r\nthroughout the central portion of the mining regions, were of much\r\ngreater force and of longer duration. And it is for this reason,\r\nalso, that we find the washed gravel and particles of gold which they\r\ncontained scattered over a larger area of country upon the surface.\r\n\r\nIt was the general opinion among the early miners that where placer\r\nmines existed would also be found rich quartz ledges, and where rich\r\nquartz ledges are found there must, for similar reasons, be good placer\r\nmining. This is true only of the central portion of the mining regions,\r\nwhere the quartz ledges have been thrown down and broken up, and is\r\nnot true of other sections, for we find farther north, among the high\r\ncliffs and rugged peaks which have not been worn down by these natural\r\nforces, quartz ledges containing free gold, in many cases of great\r\nvalue. Yet no free gold, or at least but very little, can be found\r\namong the ravines or cañons below them.\r\n\r\nIt has been often said that the early miners were a very superstitious\r\nlot of men and firm believers in luck, even more so than any others;\r\nbut this is a great mistake, for observation shows us that all grades\r\nand races of men are afflicted to a greater or less extent with this\r\npeculiar mania of belief in the efficacy of signs which give warning\r\nof coming dangers, as well as prognosticate good luck or a change\r\nin conditions. Those who are believers in this mysterious change in\r\ncircumstances termed luck are close observers of such signs, and before\r\ncommencing their operations or enterprises will first consult the\r\noracle to see if the signs are favorable.\r\n\r\nAmong the mining classes in early days, the Germans were firm believers\r\nin the potency of signs, although many Americans and those of other\r\nnationalities were not far behind them, the main difference between\r\nthem being that the former had no hesitation in acknowledging such a\r\nbelief.\r\n\r\nIn early mining days it was generally believed that success in mining\r\nwas entirely owing to luck, and this is the common belief at present\r\namong portions of the mining classes, as well as those engaged in other\r\nkinds of business. For this reason the so-called signs are intently\r\nobserved, which will indicate what the future or result of any work or\r\nenterprise is to be. From the observation of others, as well as our\r\nown experiences in the operation of many of these omens, it is very\r\nconclusively shown that in many cases such circumstances do occur, or\r\nsuch effects result, as were previously suggested by the signs; but\r\nreason teaches us that there can be no possible connection between the\r\nmere fact of a dream, or of the occurrence of any certain events and\r\nany subsequent effects. As a consequence such future effects can have\r\nno other explanation than that of coincidence, although we must admit\r\nthat the future events very often constitute a mysterious phenomenon.\r\nMany instances might be mentioned as an evidence of this, while again\r\nnumerous cases of a similar nature could be brought forth as reliable\r\nevidence of exactly the reverse. Of this latter class of effects the\r\nbeliever in lucky signs takes no note, since they are of a negative\r\ncharacter, and have, therefore, no value.\r\n\r\nAn acquaintance of mine was realizing from his ravine claim about\r\n$20 daily, and upon his way to his cabin one evening he picked up a\r\nhorseshoe which he took to his quarters and hung upon a nail, with the\r\nremark that his claim in future was “just agoin’ to pungle”; and sure\r\nenough, for about two weeks following it did “pungle” at the average of\r\n$50 per diem.\r\n\r\nA short time after another miner, a near neighbor, found, upon his way\r\nhome from work, two horseshoes, which were hung up in his cabin for\r\nluck, and strange as it may seem, instead of his claim increasing in\r\nits daily pay, in a few days it ceased paying entirely. Of course, the\r\nonly explanation for this phenomenon, as one of his friends told him,\r\nwas that in finding two horseshoes he overdid the business, for one\r\noffset the other. Another acquaintance accounted for the catastrophe\r\nby saying that very probably one of the shoes was a mule shoe, and\r\nconsequently all good luck was kicked out.\r\n\r\nAnother miner, upon commencing his work one morning, said that during\r\nthe night previous he had dreams of finding a hen’s nest containing a\r\nnumber of eggs, and was told that such a dream was surely a sign of\r\ngood luck. Singularly enough, for three or four days afterwards his\r\nclaim gave down far better than it ever had done before.\r\n\r\nA few mornings subsequent, another miner at work near by reported a\r\nsimilar dream, and he also received his reward by an increase in daily\r\npay. But a short time afterwards another miner in the same ravine, who\r\nwas making upon his claim an average daily profit of $14, reported\r\none morning that he dreamt the night before of finding a hen’s nest\r\nfrom which he took nearly a peck of eggs. It is to be feared that he\r\ntoo overdid it, as the sign for him was an entire failure. He found at\r\nnight that the lead upon which he had been at work had run out, and he\r\ncould average but two dollars per day, and was consequently forced to\r\nabandon his claim. Many explanations were given for the sign having\r\ngone back on him, with a peck of eggs behind it, too, but were all\r\nunsatisfactory with one exception, this being the only reasonable one,\r\nthat by the law of coincidences it could hardly be possible that such\r\neffects should occur three times in succession, notwithstanding the\r\nfavorable nature of the signs.\r\n\r\nMany cases could be mentioned of miners who had first discovered the\r\nnew moon over the right shoulder, and, if future prospects and events\r\nwere favorable, would always be sure to mention the fact of having seen\r\nthe new moon in the proper manner, while others who saw the new moon\r\nin a similar manner were, for certain reasons, very careful to never\r\nmention the circumstance.\r\n\r\nIt was not expected, of course, that the most intelligent miners would\r\nacknowledge a belief in such signs, and they were always ready to\r\nridicule any one who did. One of the old miners in particular, who\r\nridiculed the superstitious notion, would always close his eyes when\r\nleaving his cabin, so his partner said, and not open them till he got\r\ninto the road, and faced in the right direction in order to catch the\r\nmoon in the proper position over his right shoulder.\r\n\r\nA miner who had some trouble with another one about the right to use a\r\ncertain stream of water, the case being then in court, stated to his\r\nacquaintances upon the day of the trial that he dreamt the night before\r\nof killing a large snake. A German acquaintance informed him that he\r\nwould surely win his case, and he did.\r\n\r\nAnother miner subsequently had a similar dispute about the right to\r\na certain claim, and, dreaming of killing a big snake a short time\r\nprevious to the trial, success in winning his suit was assured him, and\r\nhe did; but in working his claim it was found to be of no value.\r\n\r\nHundreds of similar instances might be cited to show that these\r\nso-called lucky strikes, as foretold by dreams or signs, are simply\r\ncoincidences, and no other explanation, in my opinion, is possible.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, well understood that gold mining in general has\r\nreference to the method or process of getting money, or of acquiring\r\nwealth in an easy as well as in a very rapid manner, without the\r\nnecessity of toiling through a long series of years for the purpose,\r\nand it was this idea that brought many thousands into the mining\r\nregions of California. But coming here and finding, alas, that\r\neven to dig gold direct from the soil required labor, patience and\r\nperseverance, as well as an indefinite space of time, and even then\r\nwith uncertain results, was the cause of hundreds returning immediately\r\nto their Eastern homes, or, at any rate, of leaving the mining regions\r\nin disgust upon making the unpleasant discovery that gold was not to\r\nbe scraped from the surface of the ground, but that it was away down\r\nout of sight, badly mixed up with the dirt, mud and water. For these\r\nreasons, thousands who crossed the sandy plains, or who came by water\r\nto the gold mines, were sadly disappointed.\r\n\r\nIn order to find a gold deposit or lead which would pay for working, it\r\nwas, of course, necessary to travel around with pick, pan and shovel\r\namong the ravines, flats and gulches; and when what seemed a favorable\r\nspot was found, a hole of suitable dimensions had to be dug, and the\r\ndirt upon the bed rock panned to determine the value of the claim, or\r\nwhether it would pay to be worked.\r\n\r\nAfter the central portions of these ravines had been worked in ’49 and\r\n’50 it was then, of course, necessary to prospect in deeper ground,\r\nnear the banks, or in the flats and gulches.\r\n\r\nOf the great number who prospected subsequently to ’49 but a very\r\nsmall portion found claims that paid them for their trouble, while\r\nhundreds barely made a living. This was not, however, on account of\r\nthe mines having become exhausted, but can be attributed to their\r\nmanner of working, or prospecting. It was a common sight to see many\r\ntramping around among the hills, carrying their picks and shovels\r\non their shoulders, in search of a suitable spot where they could\r\nstrike it rich, but where the soil was not too deep, and this class of\r\nprospectors could very seldom find a claim worth working; for if they\r\neven ventured to sink a hole, it was generally of such a size that\r\nno idea could be formed of the nature of the bed rock or of what it\r\ncontained.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration: Two miners on their way to work one morning\r\nencountered a tall, middle-aged man, sitting by the road-side\r\nlamenting his sad fate. He said that he had left his family upon his\r\nlittle farm in the State of Illinois, and had come to try gold mining,\r\nbut couldn’t find enough to enable him to live, and was very anxious\r\nto return home again. He said that he had dug and prospected in many\r\nplaces, but could find nothing. He led the way to a ravine near at\r\nhand that he had been at work in for quite a spell, he said, “but\r\nthar warn’t nuthin’ thar,” and we found that he had started to sink a\r\nnumber of holes. They were about four feet across upon the surface of\r\nthe ground, but contracted as they approached the bed rock, coming to\r\na point finally. He was asked if this was his method of working in his\r\nfarming operations. “Wall, I reckon not, but thot it mought do here.”\r\n\r\nUpon suggesting to him the necessity when sinking a hole of keeping its\r\nfull size to the bed rock, especially in a ravine of that character, he\r\nconcluded to act according to the advice, and sure enough he found that\r\nhe had run across a very fair claim, from which he succeeded in getting\r\ngold enough to take him back again to his Eastern home.\r\n\r\nAnother man dug a hole in a shallow ravine, the ground being only about\r\nthree feet in depth; he found that the bed rock was descending towards\r\nthe center of the ravine. He dug another hole adjoining, and discovered\r\nthat the bed rock inclined towards the first, the channel being between\r\nthe two, and the place where gold would be found if there were any\r\nthere. He did not, however make a connection between the two holes, as\r\nhe ought to have done, as he was told by an old miner who passed that\r\nway; but left the wall about six inches in thickness between them. The\r\nconsequence was that the aforesaid old miner who had given him the\r\nadvice was passing the place a few days afterwards, and, finding that\r\nit had not been acted upon, commenced to investigate that six-inch\r\nwall, and discovered a very rich lead from which he took in a few days\r\nabout $1,000.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to explain here the general nature and character of\r\nthe gold deposits found up to this time. These deposits consisted of\r\nsuch as were found among washed, or quartz gravel, and were confined to\r\nthe hills or gravel claims; as well as in rivers, creeks and in such\r\nravines where the gold was deposited by the action of water, there\r\nwere what were termed benches also. These were formed by a breakdown\r\nfrom the original river beds, and usually contained beds of gravel\r\nfound upon the side of the hill below the level of the ancient beds, in\r\nslides which were formed by the sliding down of a portion of a hill. In\r\nall ravines, creeks and gulches also, the gold found was what is termed\r\nwashed gold, showing evidence of having been at some time amongst the\r\ngravel of a running stream. Upon the various flats, the gold was of\r\na similar character and found with quartz gravel, showing that these\r\nflats had at one time formed the bed of some creek or running stream.\r\nThere were some peculiar gold deposits again that differed entirely\r\nin their nature, and had an altogether different origin. The former\r\ndeposits alluded to as being in rivers, creeks, ravines, gulches,\r\nflats, slides and benches, were all supplied from the beds of ancient\r\nwater courses, which had been in course of time broken up and thrown\r\ndown, the gravel washed and scattered by the action of water to where\r\nit is now found. Among the red hills in the mining regions are found\r\nwhat are termed “red hill leads.” The gold in these is rough with sharp\r\nedges, and has never been in contact with gravel or running water. The\r\nleads are generally very narrow, in some cases being not more than an\r\ninch in width, and are found almost invariably in small, narrow and dry\r\nravines; and upon the hills above and in the vicinity will be found\r\nquartz ledges which indicate their origin.\r\n\r\nAmong these leads, quartz in a partially decayed state will often be\r\nencountered with the appearance of having been at some time in contact\r\nwith great heat. It is very evident therefore, that these streaks of\r\ngold, or leads, were deposited subsequent to the great convulsions\r\nwhich broke up the ancient river cañons, and still remain in their\r\noriginal position as when melted from the quartz ledges, which were\r\nbroken up and distributed in this manner among the ravines. There are\r\nalso found among the ravines large deposits of clay of various colors;\r\nbut as a general thing, either blue, red or yellow. Very rich deposits\r\nare often discovered mixed with or beneath this clay.\r\n\r\nThe fact that rich gold deposits oftentimes existed beneath these\r\nbeds of clay was discovered in the spring of ’50. Three or four young\r\nmen, who had just arrived in the mines, prospected a piece of ground\r\nlocated at the junction of two ravines, in what is now known as Clay\r\nRavine, just below the Pacific Quartz Mill, near Hangtown. They found,\r\nupon sinking a shaft about eight feet in depth, a bed of blue clay.\r\nIt was dry and hard. Presuming, therefore, that it was bed rock, they\r\nabandoned the place. A young man residing near, named Williamson, and\r\nan Irishman, by the way, from curiosity concluded to sink down through\r\nthis blue clay to see what was underneath. The miners who were at work\r\nin Oregon Ravine, a short distance below, heard him yelling out at the\r\ntop of his voice:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STHRUCK IT.]\r\n\r\n“Say b’ys, jest come now an’ see phwat I hev found under this clay, be\r\njabers!”\r\n\r\nUpon going up to the claim, we saw on the ground a hard solid chunk of\r\nclay, about the size of a water-bucket, taken from the bed rock, and\r\nthe under surface was one mass of gold. It was taken to the Express\r\nOffice, pounded up and found to contain $1,500; but how much he got\r\nfrom his claim was unknown.\r\n\r\nI have before explained that the chief and only machine used for the\r\nwashing of pay dirt were the cradles, toms and sluices, although other\r\nkinds of machines were often brought into the mines for which it was\r\nclaimed that they were of superior character, and warranted to save\r\nmore gold than any other kind. They were, however, in nearly all cases,\r\ninvented or constructed by persons who had little knowledge of gold\r\nmining, and were, therefore, ignorant of what was really needed, it\r\nbeing the general impression among them that gold existed among the\r\ndirt in great quantities, and that some superior process was necessary\r\nto separate it. All miners of any experience are well aware of the\r\nfact that the great difficulty or drawback to gold or placer mining,\r\nis not so much how to save the gold, but how or where to find the dirt\r\nor gravel that contains gold enough to pay for the working. That is\r\nthe main question in mining, and the manner of washing or saving the\r\ngold is of course a secondary consideration. When the richest placers\r\nwere worked out by the use of a pan and cradle, and it became necessary\r\nto wash a much greater amount of dirt, the “tom” came into use, and\r\nanswered a good purpose for a time. But the time soon arrived when a\r\ntom was found to be inadequate for the emergency, for the reason that\r\nit was necessary to wash still larger quantities of dirt or gravel, and\r\nto accomplish this the sluices were used; they, in their turn to be\r\nsuperseded by the hydraulic pipe, by which large bodies of earth and\r\ngravel could be washed with good profit that could not be made to pay\r\nby the sluicing process, and which again in its turn will be superseded\r\nby some peculiar electric process, by which means whole mountains will\r\nbe melted, and the liquid gold will flow out from the bottom of the\r\nhuge furnace in pipes arranged for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThere are at present in California, as well as in Oregon, large bodies\r\nof black and common river sand containing gold in paying quantities,\r\nonly awaiting the ingenuity of some mechanic or miner to invent a quick\r\nprocess for separating it, as no means or method is at present known\r\nwhereby this can be accomplished with any profit.\r\n\r\nUpon the Columbia River, for a distance of at least 150 miles, there\r\nare numerous sand bars that contain gold in paying quantities if any\r\nprocess can be devised for separating it. Many efforts have been made,\r\nand many ingenious mechanics have taxed their brains in the vain\r\nattempt to solve the problem. A company is now engaged upon one of the\r\nsand bars near the head waters of the Columbia in experimenting with\r\nelectricity in the attempt to separate the fine float gold from the\r\nsand. If this proves to be a success, the sand bars upon the Columbia\r\nwill be valuable mining properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n THE INDIAN WAR--A CHANGE IN THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS--THE DESPERADO--THE\r\n SAILORS--THE MINES WORKED OUT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was during this season that an event of the greatest importance\r\nto the State and to the mining interest occurred. I refer to the\r\nsubjugation of the Digger tribe of Indians, a warlike and savage race,\r\nwho seemed determined to exterminate, if possible, the American race of\r\ngold hunters; that is to say, in the opinion of the business portion\r\nof the community who had something to sell. These Indians were in many\r\ncases very badly treated and abused, and many had been killed for mere\r\nsport by the border-ruffian element from the East. The consequence, a\r\nvery natural one, was that in a spirit of revenge they resented such\r\noutrages by taking the lives of a few of those who abused them. But\r\nthis was deemed a sufficient cause for a war of extermination, and a\r\ndemand was made upon the Government for assistance. No regulars were\r\nnecessary, for the “Irregulars,” who were ever ready to volunteer when\r\nan Indian is to be butchered, were numerous.\r\n\r\nA small army was soon formed, commanded by Col. William Rogers, and\r\nwhen all was ready, or nearly so, they marched for the front, if it\r\ncould be found. A fine spot for the purpose was discovered near at\r\nhand, but a little out of range of the arrows. They went into camp and\r\nwaited for something to turn up. If any attempt was made by the Indians\r\nto charge upon their works, reinforcements were sent for at once, and\r\na change of base ordered immediately. Such was the nature of this\r\nferocious, warlike regiment of Irregulars, however, that a change of\r\nconditions was absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were hidden behind the rocks upon the opposite side of\r\nBrush Cañon, a few miles above the town, and, unconscious of danger,\r\nwere with their families engaged in various amusements. The older\r\nmembers were seated around in groups discussing the current events\r\nof the day, and indulging in reminiscences of the happy springtide of\r\nyouth when engaging in the pleasures of the chase after grasshoppers,\r\nwhen the Colonel of the Irregulars, from a high commanding position,\r\nthe top of a stump, took a view of the situation with his field glass,\r\nleaped to the soil below and ordered a charge at once.\r\n\r\nThe poor Indians, taken by surprise, fought with valor, disputing the\r\nground inch by inch; but, being overpowered by numbers, and it being\r\nalso nearly lunch time, they very precipitately vamoosed the ranch, and\r\nthe United States Government of America remained master of the field.\r\n\r\nThe ambulance train was ordered up, and the dead and wounded were\r\ncarefully handled when found. But one Irregular, however, lost his life\r\nduring the conflict, this unfortunate being Mr. W. McKinney, of Cold\r\nSprings.\r\n\r\nThe opinion among the troops, however, was general, to the effect that\r\nthe Indian department suffered terribly, and that large numbers of\r\nthem had passed over to the happy hunting ground, and were, probably,\r\nalready engaged in chasing grasshoppers in the spirit land; but after\r\nthe smoke of battle had been drifted through and the ground sluiced\r\naway, but one old squaw, with her papoose, were found in a ditch asleep.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Army of the Sierras captured all that was to be found in the\r\ndeserted Indian camp, the spoils consisting of an old pack saddle, a\r\njack knife with two blades, and one woolen shirt. These were taken\r\ninto town, and, under orders from the Government, sold at auction to\r\nthe highest bidder, the proceeds going into the Treasury and thrown in\r\namong the surplus.\r\n\r\nThis terrible and devastating uprising was thus squelched, and the\r\nIndians said they would do so no more, and they never did. The great\r\nconflict which was participated in and decided by the valor of\r\nundisciplined Irregulars, not only saved the entire country from utter\r\ndestruction, but, in addition, demonstrated the fact to the interest\r\nof all concerned in mining, that the black sand which had heretofore\r\nbeen thrown aside as valueless was in reality worth $1 per pound,\r\navoirdupois, in the following manner:\r\n\r\nPowder for the grand army being scarce, an enterprising and shrewd\r\nstorekeeper in the town, who furnished certain supplies, substituted\r\nkegs of the aforementioned sand in its place, and it was said that in\r\nconsequence of the great similarity of appearance, neither the grand\r\narmy, the Indians, nor Uncle Sam, ever knew the difference.\r\n\r\nFor further particulars and details please refer to the history of\r\nthe great conflict, as I do not wish to trespass too much upon such\r\nincidents as are matters of historical record.\r\n\r\nI desire, however, to mention a few facts in relation to this race of\r\nIndians, for, in my opinion and judging from appearances, they are very\r\nprobably the ancestors of the great Mongolian race, and that the latter\r\ndescended from them. Of course, this was some time ago, and it may be\r\npossible that it is just the other way, although it matters not which\r\nparty made the descent first, or which did the degenerating part of\r\nthe business. That the Indians have retained the old original dialect,\r\nhowever, is an evidence of a very close relationship, which the most\r\nskeptical must acknowledge.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the great battle which decided the destiny of the race and\r\nthe safety of the country, and when the grand old eagle, with prophetic\r\neye soared from aloft and, sailing majestically across the rocky\r\ncañon, flapped its wings with joy from the top of the great American\r\nbanner suspended from a pile of sage brush, the Colonel in command had\r\ndispatched an officer, in full regimentals, to demand the immediate\r\nsurrender of all goods and chattels which were contraband of war. This\r\nmeant, of course, all squaws and papooses which were in arms. The reply\r\ntold the tale of their descent at once.\r\n\r\n“You Melican man heap allee samee fool. You no foolee me muchee. You\r\nsabe squaw? You no takee, you wantee. You come catche.”\r\n\r\nThe officer explained that his object was only to cover them with the\r\nold flag to protect them from the cold weather, as there was every\r\nindication of rain.\r\n\r\nQuite a change in social conditions was now taking place. Balls and\r\ndances were more frequent, and the mining regions began to assume the\r\nappearance of civilized communities. To our Eastern friends it was of\r\ncourse a conundrum how women could live with safety here in the mines\r\nof California, in the midst of such a crowd of cow boys and frontier\r\ndesperadoes. It did seem rather strange, but the reason why women\r\ncould not only reside here in perfect safety, but could travel about\r\nthe country free from insult and molestation as well, I will give an\r\nillustration of:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WOMEN MUST BE PROTECTED.]\r\n\r\nSoon after the arrival of the fall emigration of ’50, a very pretty\r\nyoung married woman, wife of a Mr. Herrick, the hotel-keeper, could\r\nfrequently be seen riding a pony around among the hills. On one\r\noccasion she was met upon the road a few miles from town by one of this\r\nclass of men who offered her an insult. She was not long in reaching\r\ntown and reporting the fact, and almost as quickly as I have stated\r\nit he had a rope around his neck, while the other end was thrown over\r\nthe limb of a tree, but upon promising faithfully that he would never\r\ndo such a thing again, or never insult another woman in California,\r\nhe was allowed to depart. An insult to a woman was by these rough\r\nminers considered a worse crime than robbery or murder, and punished\r\naccordingly, and for this reason a woman could travel alone and\r\nunattended anywhere among the mining regions in the early days.\r\n\r\nThe presence of woman not only illustrated the influence of changed\r\nsocial conditions, but also the effect upon civilization in general;\r\nfor previous to her coming, as I have before mentioned, there was\r\namong all, or at least the greater portion, a total disregard for\r\nappearances, and a visit to the miner’s cabin would show that his mode\r\nof life and household arrangements were sadly in need of repair. Under\r\nwoman’s influence, the old cabin was put into proper shape; a washboard\r\nand tub stand by the door; the dishes are regularly washed and arranged\r\ncarefully upon the shelf, and the yard in front of the house has been\r\ncleared of old hats, boots and either rubbish--showing by the changed\r\nappearance of the old castle and its surroundings the effect of this\r\nmagical influence, tending toward higher conditions of civilization.\r\n\r\nYou see yonder a large cabin; it has recently undergone a complete\r\ntransformation. You observe that a new addition has been put on for the\r\nconvenience of cooking arrangements; in front of the house, which was\r\nformerly littered with tin cans and piles of rubbish, all is now smooth\r\nand clean. A pretty fence now surrounds the house, and if you approach\r\ncloser you will observe a sweet-pea vine and a morning-glory running\r\nup around the window, fastened with pieces of cotton twine, and in\r\nthe corners of the yard, and along by the fence, you will also notice\r\ngrowing bushes of certain varieties of roses.\r\n\r\nThe door opens and thence comes the pilgrim chap. But he does not\r\nlook like the same boy at all. Can it be he? That “biled shirt” and\r\nthose store clothes and shining boots have changed him somewhat in\r\nappearance. But why this change? What is the matter with him, you ask.\r\nWalk with me towards the house. Do you hear that strange sound? ’Tis\r\nnot the wail of a hyena or of a catamount from yonder mountain, but the\r\nwail of an infant in the direction of the house. That is what’s the\r\nmatter. That rocking motion you hear is not made by a miner’s cradle,\r\nbut the other kind, and in it is a very valuable nugget, a ten-pounder\r\nthat the pilgrim has just struck, and 24 carets fine. And now don’t\r\nyou think that it is the presence of woman that tends to elevate\r\nmankind, or you old forty-niners in particular, to higher conditions of\r\ncivilization?\r\n\r\n“I reckon,” say each and all of us.\r\n\r\nThe desperadoes and border ruffians from Texas and Missouri were\r\nnow quite numerous. Many robberies were committed and some shooting\r\nparticipated in occasionally. There were also many of this class\r\ninclined to jump claims, when it was possible to do so without danger,\r\nand, as one of them expressed it who had jumped a claim belonging to a\r\nyoung man who had just gone to his cabin for\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOMAN’S INFLUENCE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLAIM JUMPER.]\r\n\r\nlunch, “All Hades couldn’t drive me off either.” He was dressed\r\nin a kind of masquerade costume, and a gambler by profession from\r\nsome interior town in Missouri. He wore a white fur plug hat; blue\r\nswallow-tail coat with brass buttons, and around his waist a broad belt\r\ncontaining weapons enough for a whole regiment. But wait; a large,\r\npowerfully built man was walking very leisurely toward the claim,\r\nfollowed by the young man, its owner. The big fellow, C. Marple, who\r\nwas from Philadelphia, in a very mild and persuasive tone of voice\r\nrequested the U. S. arsenal to kindly leave the claim; but placing\r\nhis hand upon the most convenient weapon the claim jumper refused.\r\nMr. Marple, in a very polite manner, stepped towards him, and taking\r\nhim by the collar kindly assisted him to leave, which he did without\r\nany further trouble; proving the well known fact that the greater the\r\nscoundrel, the greater the coward,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ART OF SELF-DEFENCE.]\r\n\r\nand requiring a great number of weapons, therefore, to convince others\r\nof his bravery.\r\n\r\nA desperado by the name of Burns, the same who afterwards assisted in\r\nthe capture of the noted bandit, Joaquin, came across the plains this\r\nseason, and could be seen visiting and lounging around the various\r\nbar-rooms, carrying a miniature U. S. arsenal around his waist. Having\r\none day a dispute with this same Mr. Marple in relation to some\r\ntrifling matter, he grasped the handle of his favorite weapon, but the\r\nunfrightened Yank, shoving his clenched fist in close proximity to the\r\ndesperado’s left eye, playfully remarked:\r\n\r\n“Yes, draw your weapon, and I’ll bet drinks for the crowd that I knock\r\nyou down before you can cock it.”\r\n\r\nBurns eyed the huge fist, concluded that he would like its appearance\r\nbetter at a distance, put up his weapon, and treated the crowd. One of\r\nthese brave frontier ruffians made his stopping place and home at a\r\nway station, or bar-room, located upon the emigrant road a few miles\r\nfrom Hangtown, and was very frequently in the habit of accosting miners\r\nand strangers who had occasion to stop at the place, in a very rough\r\nand barbarous manner. He would draw a weapon, and ask if they had said\r\ntheir prayers and were ready to die, getting, of course, his whiskey\r\nfree as a compromise, upon condition of putting up his weapons. Upon\r\none occasion, however, he struck a costumer, a regular old-fashioned,\r\nJacksonian Democrat from Kentucky, who did not believe in compromising.\r\n\r\nAs the latter stood at the bar enjoying his beverage, the border\r\nruffian approached him with an immense bowie knife raised above his\r\nhead, and inquired if the stranger had said his prayers that morning,\r\nat the same time making a motion as if to strike. The old Kentuckian\r\nremarked that he had not, as he had done all his praying in his younger\r\ndays, and enough, he reckoned, to last him the rest of his life, at the\r\nsame time drawing his pistol from his belt, and sending a ball crashing\r\nthrough the brain of the desperado. No inquest, as the coroner did not\r\nthink it was necessary.\r\n\r\nThis class of desperadoes was now becoming quite numerous in the mining\r\nregions, and caused much trouble and annoyance. But they must not be\r\nconfounded with, nor be included in, what in more modern times are\r\ndenominated as cow-boys; for the latter are a later invention, and as a\r\nrule of a higher order, although there may be many desperate characters\r\namong them. Yet the great majority\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NO COMPROMISE.]\r\n\r\nof cow-boys are respectable as compared with the border ruffians of\r\nforty years ago. The term desperado, as I am informed, is derived from\r\nthe Sanscrit, or some other tongue: desper signifying to “git” and ado\r\nbeing an abbreviation of the word adieu; in border dialect meaning\r\n“Farewell, I’m off.” The individual who made the application, even if\r\nit was many years ago, knew who he had reference to; for if ever there\r\nwas a man who felt inclined to “git” and to tender an affectionate\r\nfarewell, it is one of these old-style border ruffians or desperadoes,\r\nwhen, chancing to be alone, he meets some one with whom he is not on\r\ngood speaking terms, the sight of whose clenched fist strikes terror\r\ninto his soul.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SIMILE.]\r\n\r\nThey resemble the hyena very much, for when in numbers they are brave,\r\nferocious and warlike, and will at such times attack anything that\r\nhas legs, from an old milk-stool to a yearling calf, or anything that\r\nwalks, from a congressman to the walking-beam of a steamboat; but when\r\nalone and he scents danger from afar, although encased in armor and\r\nwith an arsenal suspended to his waist, yet at such a time he resembles\r\nvery much the appearance of a little dog running up the road with a big\r\ntin kettle tied to his tail, while from a rear view all that can be\r\nseen is the hardware.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW COMER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISCOVERY OF THE RED HILL GOLD.]\r\n\r\nAs the spring of ’51 approached, the opinion became general that the\r\nmines of California were very nearly worked out, or rather that portion\r\nof them which was thought to be worth working, and consequently many\r\nleft the mining regions in the dry diggings and went up to the various\r\nrivers, north or south, others again returning to their Eastern homes.\r\nOwing to the great specific gravity of gold, and being ignorant, also,\r\nof the reasons why gold was almost invariably associated with running\r\nstreams, for at this time quartz was unknown and hill gravel mining\r\nwas not a possible conception, it was supposed that gold would always\r\nbe found only in the lowest places. The time soon arrived, however,\r\nwhen all old miners, in this mining region at least, were to learn\r\nsomething new in relation to mining, and discover that the richest\r\ndeposits were not in the lowest places by any means, but in the hills\r\nabove, in the beds of other, older rivers, and also among the quartz,\r\nwhich is called the mother of gold, since it is only in this rock that\r\ngold is found in its original state. To illustrate: Some miners were at\r\nwork with their cradles in what is called Emigrant Ravine, and about\r\ntwo miles above town. It was a hot, sultry day, and a stranger, with\r\nhis pick and pan for prospecting, inquired of them if there was a place\r\nwhere he could start in to work. One of the miners, for a joke, pointed\r\ntowards an oak tree near the ravine upon a little rise of ground, and\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TARS ON THE HILL.]\r\n\r\n“Yes, there by that tree is the finest place to work that I know of.”\r\n\r\nThe prospector took a view of the ground, and, believing the old miner\r\nto be in earnest, commenced to work. It was deep; the ground was dry\r\nand hard, but, by perseverance and hard work, in about two days he\r\nfound the bed rock eight or ten feet below the surface, and from the\r\nbottom of this hole he cradled out more gold in a week than the company\r\nof astonished miners who had fooled him had obtained in their whole\r\nseason’s work. In this manner it was soon fully demonstrated that\r\ngold was universally scattered all over, in spots, in no one place in\r\nparticular, but wherever you could find it.\r\n\r\nA short time subsequent to this a colored man, in walking along the\r\ntrail at the foot of a steep hill, picked up a small piece of gold. Its\r\nedges were sharp, and from all appearances it had never been in running\r\nwater; but the question was, where did this come from, and there lay\r\nthe mystery. Not from the ravine, and certainly not from the steep\r\nside hill; but at any rate the colored man, from curiosity, dug a hole\r\nupon the steep side hill. He found no gravel, but saw that the soil\r\nupon the bed rock was a deep crimson color, and that, scattered around\r\namong this blood red earth was to be found coarse gold. This had never\r\nbeen in contact with water, but had been deposited by heat or chemical\r\naction, and was the first discovery in this section of the rich, red\r\nhill gold deposits.\r\n\r\nIt was in the spring of ’50 that four sailors, who had deserted from\r\ntheir ship in San Francisco, took a cruise up among the mines, as they\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n“Jest to see how the land lay.”\r\n\r\nThey cruised about for several days, hardly knowing what to do or even\r\nhow to do it, and during one of their daily excursions they found\r\nthemselves near the head of a small ravine, and a very steep one, which\r\nemptied down into the big cañon. It was a pleasant spot, and one of\r\nthem remarked:\r\n\r\n“Well now, me lads, let’s drop anchor here; pipe all hands, pass the\r\ngrog, and make the blarsted dirt fly.”\r\n\r\nSo one of them volunteered to commence operations by measuring off a\r\nspot about the size of the forehatch, and then commenced work with his\r\npick and shovel to break out the cargo, until he struck bottom, as he\r\nremarked. A number of miners at work in the ravine below watched the\r\noperations of the Jack Tars, and were very much amused to see them\r\nsinking a hole away up at the top of a hill. The soil was not deep, and\r\nthe tars, by taking a turn about at the helm, were soon down to the bed\r\nrock, upon which they found the dirt and gravel of a very pretty red\r\ncolor. Filling a pan they took it to the ravine below, where one of the\r\nold miners kindly offered to wash it for them, although he remarked\r\nthat it was hardly necessary, for gold never could have got away up\r\nthere at the top of the hill. But upon washing it, they found to their\r\nastonishment that there was gold “away up there on the hill,” and a\r\nconsiderable lot of it too, as the amount in the pan indicated, for it\r\ncontained about $20. The jolly Tars procured cradles and the necessary\r\ntools, and started in to work, at which they continued some three\r\nmonths, during which time they extracted about $20,000, as was stated\r\nby Adams & Co.’s agent soon after they left. The ravine was afterwards\r\nknown as the “Sailor Boy’s Ravine,” being about one and a half miles\r\nfrom Hangtown and near the trail to the American River.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISCOVERY OF THE OLD RIVER BEDS.]\r\n\r\nIt was late in the winter or fall of ’49, that the discovery by W.\r\nSalmon and his comrades that gold existed in the hills in the vicinity\r\nof Georgetown was made, and that many of them contained beds of gravel\r\nwhich were rich in gold, this fact being well demonstrated by the\r\ndiscovery in Forest Hill, a few months later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNCLE BEN ON GEOLOGY.]\r\n\r\nUpon the discovery of hill diggings, mining assumed another form, for\r\ninstead of the mines being worked out, which was the general opinion,\r\nwe were only beginning to learn where to find the precious metal. The\r\nfirst hill diggings in Eldorado County were discovered near Upper\r\nHangtown, early in the spring of ’51, by the Aiken brothers, who worked\r\na small ravine located on the side of Indian Hill. When working near\r\nthe upper end of the ravine their pay dirt left them, and, instead of\r\na slate bed rock, they now found that it had changed to what appeared\r\nto be of the nature of sandstone. This, however, proved to be, upon\r\nexamination, cement, under which, upon working through it, they found\r\na deposit of rich gravel resting upon a slate foundation, and pitching\r\ninto the hill. Other hills in the vicinity were soon found to be\r\nsimilar in character, cement capped, containing ancient river beds rich\r\nin gold.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of these ancient river beds, among a portion of the\r\nminers created quite a discussion as to their origin and the period,\r\nin geological eras, when this ancient river system was destroyed,\r\nand by what forces. Many of the discussions between these veteran,\r\nself-taught, geological expounders were interesting, as well as\r\ninstructive, each one, of course, having a theory of his own which\r\nmust be the only reasonable interpretation. One of the most prominent\r\nof these students of nature was an old gentleman from the State of\r\nWisconsin, Uncle Ben Coats, and to listen to one of his geological\r\nlectures, under the shade of an aged oak, surrounded by a crowd of\r\nminers who were all anxious to be informed as to the facts of the case,\r\nwas decidedly instructive and interesting--a scene, too, reminding one\r\nof Socrates or Aristotle lecturing to his pupils in the shady groves of\r\nAthens. We, the miners, soon became proficient in the use of the words\r\ntertiary, pliocene, carboniferous, spirituous, and gaseous eras or\r\nepochs, retaining even to the present time a very vivid recollection of\r\nthem, but more especially of the two latter epochs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n MINING SPECULATORS--THE LOST BROTHER--GAMBLING--A GENEROUS GAMBLER--AN\r\n IMPORTANT DISCOVERY--BEGINNING OF FRUIT CULTURE AND WINE MANUFACTURE\r\n IN CALIFORNIA--THE FIRST CHURCH ORGANIZATION IN THE MINING\r\n REGIONS--“OLD NICK” AND HIS ANIMALS--“OLD SYD.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMany persons were now continually ruining into the mines, and\r\nstupendous frauds were being perpetrated upon them in the sale of\r\nmining claims.\r\n\r\nOne very enterprising individual who had drifted into the low red hill\r\nor slide in the hope of finding a lead, being disappointed, loaded his\r\nshot-gun with gold dust, and discharged it into various places. Upon\r\nfinding a newcomer who desired to purchase, he was requested to take\r\na pan and prospect for himself, which the victim would often do with\r\nremarkable success. He, however, saw the joke after he had bought the\r\nmine, and procuring a shot-gun played the same game on some other chap;\r\nand I’m not sure, but I think that their descendants have inherited\r\nthe same habit, and are yet shooting and selling old claims. One sale\r\nof a mining claim is worth mentioning. It was a rich piece of ground\r\nin the lower part of Hangtown, and located on a rich lead. A chap who\r\nhad been hard at work for nearly ten days stripping the top dirt from\r\nhis claim, about fifteen feet square and ten feet deep, prospecting a\r\npan of dirt in one corner and finding nothing, concluded to sell it,\r\nif possible. Presently along came three or four young men who had just\r\narrived, and he proposed to sell it to them, explaining that there\r\nwas good pay a little deeper. They paid him his price--one hundred\r\nand fifty dollars--and early next morning started in to work. By 3\r\nP.M. they were down to bed rock in various places, and\r\nwater being handy they washed a pan just for curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe seller of the claim, who lingered around to see how badly he had\r\nfooled them, was, when he saw them wash out pan after pan,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHARP SHOOTERS.]\r\n\r\ncontaining from ten dollars to twenty dollars, fifty dollars, and one\r\nhundred dollars to a pan, the most disgusted man in California. He\r\ntried to buy it back, and offered five hundred dollars for it. They\r\ntook out in about five days nearly $7,000, and this was their first\r\nmining venture.\r\n\r\nThe winter of ’50-51 as before stated was a very dry one, and there\r\nwas hardly water enough to run a tom. Consequently the summer of ’51\r\nwas very dry, and the dry diggings throughout the country were almost\r\nentirely deserted. This season saw large amounts of gold dust taken\r\nfrom the river beds of the Yuba, Feather and Bear Rivers, as well as\r\nin the various forks of the American, and also in the streams in the\r\ncentral and lower portions of the State. Small towns were now being\r\nstarted in the various mining districts. School-houses and churches\r\nwere conspicuous among all, and the country was now, more than ever,\r\nassuming the appearance of civilization, to the great disgust of the\r\nborder-ruffian element, one of whom was heard to remark:\r\n\r\n“That ef these Yanks didn’t stop with that ar’ nonsense of fooling away\r\ntheir time with school an’ prayin’ shebangs, the whole country would go\r\nto h--l.” But time has since proved that he lied.\r\n\r\nThe emigration of this fall was larger than that of the year previous\r\nand was that of a better class, consisting principally of families,\r\nmany of whom were from States east of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nA bulletin board, or, rather, a book for registering the names of the\r\nnewly-arrived emigrants in order that friends and acquaintances could\r\nlearn of their destination and location, was put up. Many amusing\r\nincidents occurred in the search for those who had previously arrived.\r\nA young man, having just arrived, made inquiries among the various\r\nbarrooms and hotels for his brother, who had, as he was informed by\r\nthe bulletin board, come across the plains this season. The young man\r\nwas from Ohio, and his older brother had left home some twelve or\r\nfifteen years previous. The new arrival, therefore, was very anxious to\r\nfind his brother. The train with which the young man had just arrived\r\nwas under the control of a man from New Orleans called the Colonel,\r\nhis real name not being known by any one upon the train. In making\r\ninquiries in one of the barrooms, with the hope of finding some one who\r\ncould give him the required information in regard to his brother, a\r\ngentleman from New Orleans, who was present, remarked:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DISGUSTED SPECULATOR.]\r\n\r\n“Why, the man you’re inquiring for, the Colonel, is here in town, and I\r\nsaw him not ten minutes ago over there in that drug store.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOUND HIS BROTHER.]\r\n\r\nThe young man went over and saw the Colonel, with whom he had crossed\r\nthe plains, in the store, and of course mentioned the reasons for his\r\ncoming in as directed.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the Colonel, “what was your brother’s name?”\r\n\r\n“His name was William B. Richards.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” rejoined the Colonel, “that is my name.”\r\n\r\nSure enough, this Colonel with whom he had crossed the plains was the\r\nlong-lost brother!\r\n\r\nIt was the habit, or custom rather, in early days to give to each man a\r\ncertain nickname by which he was usually known, his real name being, as\r\na general rule, unknown, or even unasked for. “Whar air you from?” was\r\nthe main question and the information most desired, and usually decided\r\nhis nickname.\r\n\r\nHere were “Old Pike,” “Big and Little Pike,” “Old Kentuck,” “Texas\r\nJack,” “Texas Jim,” “Old Arkansas”; if Scotch, he was “Sandy,” or\r\n“Scotty”; if from the East, “Little or Big Yank,” and their mining\r\nlocations would in some cases, also decide their names. There were\r\n“French Flat Pete,” “Sandy Hill Mike,” “Poverty Point Jim,” _ad\r\ninfinitum_.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, a young miner returned to his Eastern home for a\r\nvisit, and one day, while visiting at some family acquaintances with\r\nhis parents at a distance, upon looking over some daguerrotypes lying\r\non the tables, he remarked that one of them resembled very much a young\r\nman with whom he had worked, and who was at present living in the same\r\nplace, Mocklmne Hill, in a cabin near his. He could not tell the name,\r\nbut he went by the name of Jack, and one day, being in his cabin, saw\r\na book upon the table, and found upon looking at it, that it was the\r\n“Pilgrims Progress,” on the fly leaf of which was written the name of\r\nElizabeth Andrews.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Oh!” said a young lady present, “that is my brother, John Andrews,\r\nand we haven’t heard from him for nearly 15 years, and were afraid that\r\nsome accident had happened to him somewhere.”\r\n\r\nAfter the commencement of the rainy season, in the fall of ’51, the\r\nriver miners flocked into the placer mining districts. Other arrivals\r\nfrom across the waters, soon swelled the population in all of the\r\nvarious mining camps. Gambling in all of its various forms became again\r\nthe principal amusement. Barrooms and gambling-houses vied with each\r\nother in furnishing their patrons with the finest and loudest music,\r\nand bands could be heard playing in all of them during the greater\r\nportion of the evening, and until the wee sma’ hours of the morning.\r\nThe professionals were as a general rule Southerners by birth, hailing\r\nfrom New Orleans, Louisville, Memphis, Richmond and St. Louis; whilst\r\nonly occasionally would be found a sport claiming Boston or New York\r\nas his birthplace. Many of this class were men of good education and\r\nabilities, and many of them descendants of respectable families as\r\nwell. They had been accustomed from childhood to associate with this\r\nclass in their native cities, and therefore inherited or acquired\r\nthe gambling trait of character. It is of course well understood that\r\nall men who gamble for money are necessarily very bad characters; but\r\nthe professional gambler of early days formed, in many instances, an\r\nexception to this general rule, and should not be confounded with the\r\nlower ten-cent ante poker gambler found bumming and loafing around\r\nthe gambling places of to-day. Among this former class were as many\r\ngood, honest and square-dealing men as could generally be found among\r\nthose engaged in any other business, and they were, as a rule, more\r\ncharitable, being always ready to contribute their share, and a little\r\nmore too, towards assisting those who were in distress.\r\n\r\nA lady with two daughters arrived in the mines late in the autumn of\r\n’49, her husband having died on the plains during the journey. They\r\nwere in a very destitute condition and among strangers in a strange\r\nland, without a single acquaintance in the State, as far as they knew.\r\nHer great desire was to return to their Eastern home, and to enable\r\nthem to do so newly-found friends used every effort, endeavoring, among\r\nthe miners and business men of the town, to raise sufficient money for\r\nthe purpose; but not enough money, however, could be collected. Some\r\none mentioned the circumstance in one of the gambling houses, and one\r\ngambler, Lucky Bill, whose sad fate I have before mentioned, who was\r\npresent, remarked:\r\n\r\n“Well, if Mrs. S. wishes to return East again with her daughters, she\r\nshall go.”\r\n\r\nTaking his hat around among the gamblers in the various houses, he\r\nraised in one hour about $1,500, which was sent to her, and in a few\r\ndays the family went on its way rejoicing.\r\n\r\nThe winter of ’51-’52 was a very damp one, and mining throughout the\r\nentire region was carried on very extensively with toms, long and\r\nshort, and towards spring sluices came into use, which enabled the\r\nminer to wash large quantities of dirt that would not pay by any\r\nother process. The greatest activity prevailed among all classes, and\r\nfortunes were realized by many. Among the arrivals during this year\r\nfrom the East, were many who had previously been in the mines and\r\nreturned home; some to remain, while many had been to visit parents,\r\nwives and families as well, also in some few cases with the intention\r\nto return with a partner. Among the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GAMBLER’S CHARITY.]\r\n\r\nlatter class was a young man from Philadelphia, who had been absent\r\nfrom his loved one nearly two years. During the first year after\r\nparting he had written to her by every steamer; but, for some reason,\r\nfor several months previous to revisiting his home he had neglected to\r\ncorrespond, not dreaming of the effect which such neglect sometimes\r\nproduces upon the female mind. Upon arriving in his native city he\r\nhastened at once to the home of his adored one, knocked upon the door,\r\nand the mother of his darling Maggie, answering the call, invite him in\r\nwith the greatest pleasure. Maggie is called; she enters the room, and\r\nthe negligent miner goes for her, but hold! with a wave of the hand,\r\nshe exclaims:\r\n\r\n“Joseph, away, away! I thought you were dead, and I’m a married woman\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\nJoe’s advice to all young men upon his return to California was: “Boys,\r\nwrite often! Write often!”\r\n\r\nDuring the winter, many ditches had been dug, bringing water from the\r\nmountain streams into the various mining districts, thus enabling the\r\nminers to work ravines, slides and benches, which never before had been\r\nworked. This extended the area of mining ground, and from this time\r\nforth it was possible to work nearly all gold-bearing soil.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of ’52, many who had succeeded in accumulating a\r\nsufficient amount of gold turned their attention to the cultivation\r\nof land, and to stock-raising in other portions of the State; and\r\nthroughout the summer, ranches were pre-empted and located in many of\r\nthe lower counties, for the very important discovery had now been made\r\nthat a portion of California, at least, contained land suitable for\r\nagriculture. Up to this time, however, but very few people came with\r\nthe intention of remaining, the principal purpose being to acquire a\r\nsufficient amount of gold, and then to return as soon as possible to\r\ntheir Eastern homes. But to thousands this quick return home was a\r\ndelusion and a snare; for just how to return, or how to acquire the\r\nnecessary means for so doing, was a conundrum that they endeavored to\r\nsolve, but in many instances were finally compelled to give up.\r\n\r\nMany left wives and families in the East, expecting to meet them again\r\nin a short time; but from sickness, misfortune, and poor luck, as well\r\nas in consequence of bad habits, the years rolled on, and they became\r\nweaned from their loved ones at home, who\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WRITE OFTEN, BOYS!]\r\n\r\nwere finally forgotten. In one instance, a man from an Eastern State,\r\nleaving a wife and several daughters to care for themselves, arrived\r\nhere in ’50. He soon forgot his family in the East, but after a few\r\nyears, being very unsuccessful in his mining and business matters, and\r\nhearing that his daughters had made wealthy marriages, concluded to\r\nsurprise them with a visit. As the result proved, he was himself the\r\nmost surprised man in that section of the country, for none of them\r\nknew him and would not even recognize him, a daughter saying that as he\r\nhad never written nor sent them one dollar to assist them, therefore\r\nhe could not be their father, and they kindly bade him farewell. He\r\nreturned to California a sadder, but a more single man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SURPRISE.]\r\n\r\nPrevious to the discovery of the old river channels in the hills, it\r\nwas the almost universal opinion, I think, that the mines would in a\r\nvery few years be entirely worked out, and all would be compelled to\r\nreturn to their Eastern homes; but by the discovery of the hill gravel\r\nmining, the time necessary to accomplish this in was of course extended\r\nto a later day, and taken in connection, also, with the fact of the\r\nother very important discoveries, that good land was found in some of\r\nthe other counties, it looked very reasonable to suppose that it would\r\nbe possible to live here, and establish permanent homes in California.\r\nIt was not until about three years later that this opinion became\r\nprevalent, and hundreds of families throughout the mining regions came\r\nto the conclusion that this might prove to be a pretty good country to\r\nlive in after all.\r\n\r\nSteamers were now making regular trips, bringing letters from home and\r\nfriends semi-monthly. Besides, ships were continually arriving laden\r\nwith all the necessaries of life, as well as its conveniences, and\r\nladies could appear in the streets of the small, inferior mining towns\r\nsporting the latest styles of dress, hats and crinoline attachments,\r\nsimilar to those in the streets of New York or Boston, and what more\r\ncould they desire? Wages were high in all of the towns and cities;\r\nprovisions and groceries were reasonable in price, and the whole\r\ncountry assumed the air of a continuation of conditions of general\r\nprosperity of a more permanent character. The discovery was further\r\nmade that, although malaria and mosquitoes were prevalent in certain\r\nportions of the country near the river margins, and also in the\r\nvicinity of certain flats covered by stagnant waters, and that fleas\r\nin swarms infested its chief city, yet the country in general was a\r\nvery healthy one, the fleas being confined to their native soil and not\r\nallowed to scatter around over the State much.\r\n\r\nThe diverting of the water from mountain streams by means of flumes\r\nand ditches for mining purposes, changed entirely the character and\r\ngeneral appearance of the mining regions, for the eye was soon greeted\r\nwith the appearance of gardens scattered around among the hills, as\r\nwell as in various camps. Cabbages raised their shaggy heads in their\r\nbeds, adjacent to the bed of violets and daisies. Radishes, turnips\r\nand horse-radish, etc., could be found profusely scattered here and\r\nthere, surrounded with rose-bushes, dahlias and the high, lofty and\r\naristocratic sunflower. Beautiful cottages, surrounded with blooming\r\ngardens, could be seen dotting the sides and gentle slopes of the hills\r\nin the environments of the various mining towns, all denoting the fact\r\nof changed conditions, and telling in plain language that now we have\r\ncome to stay. These changed conditions were not, however, confined to\r\nany one particular section of the country, but to all of the mineral\r\nregions that at this time were being worked, which included the central\r\ncounties of the State, as well also as the chief towns and cities. All\r\nreceived the impulse of the change, and moved forward in their course\r\ntoward a higher improvement of conditions.\r\n\r\nWith these changes came, also, from the far East, many who had\r\npreviously returned to their Eastern homes, under the impression\r\nwhen they left that a total collapse here of all mining and business\r\ninterests generally was a question of but a few short years, and being\r\nformed of that material peculiar to the pioneer, too proud to beg their\r\nway, would, therefore, be compelled to remain and make their future\r\ndwelling places in company with the Indians, amid the ruins of the once\r\nthrifty but now deserted mining villages. Many of these men returned,\r\nbringing their families with them also, satisfied that they found at\r\nlast a suitable spot upon the face of the earth for a home, safe from\r\nthe freezing blizzard and the destructive cyclone; and a country, too,\r\nwhere at night, after the toil of the day is over and all have retired\r\nto rest, and sweet, refreshing sleep is desired, the mercury in the\r\ntube of the thermometer hanging by the door, which has been through the\r\nday pretty well up towards the nineties, does not reverse the natural\r\norder of things as it does in the East, and continue climbing up during\r\nthe night, forgetting to fall. On the contrary, here it conforms with\r\nthe natural law, and gently descends from its lofty elevation of the\r\nday, evidencing a more agreeable temperature, necessary to sweet and\r\nrefreshing slumber.\r\n\r\nThese things, and many other facts of a similar nature, brought to our\r\nState emigrants not only from the East, but from all other countries\r\nof the globe, who desired to live under such favorable conditions, and\r\nin a short time there could be found in the mining regions, as well\r\nas in the chief towns and cities, representatives from almost every\r\nnation. But a very small proportion, however, of those who came into\r\nthe mountains in the year ’53 engaged in the business of mining, for\r\nprevious to this time the very important discovery had been made that,\r\nby the use of water for irrigation, the soil could be rendered highly\r\nproductive, and all kinds of fruits could be raised in the red and\r\napparently barren soil. The German population commenced the cultivation\r\nof the grape vine, and from this point in the history of California can\r\nbe dated the inception of the fruit and wine industries of the Pacific\r\nSlope, which in a few years swelled to immense proportions. The little\r\nvalleys and level places, suitable for orchards and vineyards, were\r\nreadily located, and everything indicated the fact that all had become\r\nconvinced that this was the promised land, for which they had so long\r\nbeen searching.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the gold seekers from the Eastern side\r\nof the Continent, in their earnest desire to improve their financial\r\ncondition, should entirely overlook their spiritual welfare; and that\r\nthey did not forget their early training was evident from the fact that\r\nin the spring of ’51 a church was organized, and a suitable building\r\nerected near the mouth of Cedar Ravine, where services were held upon\r\nthe Sabbath. The Rev. Mr. Owens was the first minister to officiate,\r\nand it was stated that this was the first church organization in the\r\nmining regions. The discovery was soon made, that although we had a\r\nchurch and a very respectable congregation, containing quite a number\r\nof ladies and a few children, yet there was something else wanting,\r\nsomething that had been associated in our minds from infancy in\r\nconnection with a church, and this was a bell. The question therefore\r\nat once suggested itself as to how we could reasonably expect success\r\nin spiritual matters without a bell. Upon the supposition that this\r\nwould be an impossibility, a committee was appointed, and money was\r\nraised for the purchase of one.\r\n\r\nAfter much inquiry, the committee succeeded in purchasing in San\r\nFrancisco an old ship’s bell. This upon its arrival was hailed with\r\nhearty cheers, and elevated in due time to its lofty perch upon the\r\nroof of the church. The sound of it could be heard for many miles\r\naround, reverberating among the ravines and cañons, telling to the\r\nminers far and near, in the plainest tones and in unmistakable\r\nlanguage, that the holy Sabbath day had not only found its way across\r\nthe barren desert and the mountain ranges, but had come to stay, and\r\nthey must not forget it.\r\n\r\nAll persons are, perhaps, aware that the peculiar tone of a bell which\r\nwe have often been accustomed to hear, and are therefore familiar with,\r\ncan very easily be distinguished from the tones of another, even after\r\nthe lapse of many years. Near the head of the Big Cañon, about two\r\nmiles from the town, was a cabin occupied by three or four men who had\r\nfollowed the sea, and upon the first Sabbath morning when the bell was\r\nrung the sound of it reached the ears of the sailor boys; and one of\r\nthem rushing from the cabin door exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Blast me eyes, shipmates, if thet aint ole Dick’s voice” (the name\r\ngiven to the bell on shipboard), “and I’ll jest bet a tar bucket agin\r\nan ole soldier, that the Capt’in of the ship has been on a spree, lost\r\nhis bearin’s, and is a sailin’ up Hangtown Creek, and a comin’ to\r\nanchor off the town. We’ll scrub decks, trim sails, make all taut, me\r\nlads, and take a cruise down that way, and hev a talk with ole Dick.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “THE VOICE OF OLD DICK.”]\r\n\r\nJack was informed upon reaching town that the bell upon the church,\r\nsure enough, was formerly used upon the ship “Staffordshire.”\r\n\r\n“Yas” says Jack; “I wud know that bell in any part o’ the world. For\r\ntwelve years Dick and I sailed together the seas over, from the China\r\nSea up through the Mediterranean, and the Indian Ocean; an’ we could\r\nall understan’ Dick’s language when he talked to us. It was Dick who\r\ntole us when the plum duff and ole horse was ready fur us to stow away\r\nin our lockers. When ’twas our watch below, an’ also late at night,\r\nwhen ’twas our watch on deck, we wud hear ole Dick sing out, ‘Aye,\r\nbelow there, me hearties! Rouse out, ye lubbers, an’ come on deck,’\r\nan’ we always obeyed his orders.’ Well, me lads, ’tis quite a change\r\nfur ole Dick from the deck of a ship tossin’ about on the ocean, to\r\nthe roof of a church up in Hangtown; but he’ll do his duty faithfully\r\nan’ if the land lubbers will be as quick to come on deck for prayers\r\nwhen he talks to ’em on a Sunday mornin,’ as the lubbers in the ship’s\r\nfo’cas’le were, they’ll all sail through life in safety with a fair\r\nwind. An’ then, when their voyage is ended, and Dick tells them that\r\ntis their watch below, they can slip their cables from this world\r\nwithout fear, sail over to the other side, an’ find a safe harbor in\r\nthe next.”\r\n\r\nAbout thirty-eight years have now passed since the old ship’s bell\r\nfirst made its appearance in the mining regions. It served its purpose\r\nwell for a short time upon the roof of the church, in calling together\r\nthe miners for prayers on Sunday mornings; but an increase in number\r\nof the congregation demanded a larger edifice. A larger bell was\r\ntherefore deemed necessary, and Dick was transferred to the roof of the\r\nschool-house on the hill, from which his voice can yet be heard, with\r\nthe same cheerful tone calling upon the children to come and prepare\r\nthemselves to take a part in the active duties of life.\r\n\r\nThe school was for a long time under the instruction of Mr. Cyrus\r\nBartlett, of New Bedford, Mass.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of ’51, no little excitement was created in the town,\r\nby the entrance of a person whose name was Ben Nickerson, but who\r\nwas generally known, however, as “Old Nick.” He brought into the\r\nmines with him a rather superannuated specimen of a grizzly, with a\r\ndiminutive donkey as an accompaniment, and the posters upon the fences\r\nconveyed the valuable information that on the hill in the rear of the\r\nCourt House, within an inclosure erected for the express purpose, at\r\n2 P.M. daily, Sundays unexcepted, would be witnessed\r\na most terrific combat between these two ferocious animals: tickets\r\n$1, to be had at the door; reserved seats for ladies and children at\r\nhalf price. To the credit of the ladies in the mining regions, it\r\nmay be as well to mention that none ever visited old Nick, nor his\r\ninhuman exhibition. Occasionally the programme would be changed by\r\nthe substitution of a wild Spanish bull, in place of the donkey. In a\r\nshort time, however, public sentiment revolted against the inhuman\r\nexhibition, and the citizens, en masse, tore down the structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD NICK’S GRAND ENTREE.]\r\n\r\nMany old-timers will remember Syd Ketchum, of Hangtown. He was full of\r\nhis jokes, and was rightly named, for it was his greatest delight to\r\n“ketch ’um” (the boys) occasionally. One afternoon he took his station\r\nin the middle of the street in front of the Empire saloon, and casting\r\nhis eyes upward seemed to be gazing\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CYCLONE.]\r\n\r\nat some extraordinary object in the heavens. In a few minutes he was\r\nsurrounded by others who were anxious to see what he was gazing at\r\nso earnestly, and among these was Anderson, the actor, who took his\r\nstation in front of Syd, and gazed intently and long in the same\r\ndirection. Finally, he turned to Syd and asked what he saw.\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing,” was the answer as he walked away.\r\n\r\nAnderson, with his hands jammed in his pockets, stood in the same spot\r\nand watched the joker until the latter was out of sight, and remarked,\r\nas he turned to enter the saloon again:\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll be durned.”\r\n\r\n“It was but a few days after this that Syd, rushing into the Belle\r\nUnion gaming house out of breath, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Horrible, horrible. The Coloma stage, with a full load of passengers,\r\nhas just run off the Coloma street bridge.”\r\n\r\n“Of course there was a great rush on the part of the crowd to the\r\ncorner below for the purpose of witnessing the horrible accident, and\r\namong them was Anderson, the actor, in the lead. Upon their arrival at\r\nthe corner they saw the stage, with its load of passengers, on its way\r\nup Coloma street, and it at once occurred to them that the stage never\r\ncould have gotten across the bridge without running off at the further\r\nend of it.\r\n\r\n“Well,” says Anderson, “durned if I don’t get even with old Syd, if I\r\nhave to live in Hangtown the rest of my life.”\r\n\r\nHe watched his opportunity and it soon came.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the fall and raining. In the large gambling house called\r\nthe Trio Hall, sitting around a great sheet iron stove one afternoon\r\nwere a number of men enjoying themselves, and among them was Syd.\r\n\r\nAll at once the front door was violently opened and in rushed Anderson,\r\nthe actor. He was hatless, and, from all appearances, was in the full\r\nenjoyment of a full-fledged case of “jimjams.” He stepped to the stove\r\nand with his foot kicked open the door, at the same time drawing from\r\nunder his coat a large powder horn, which he threw into the stove,\r\nexclaiming:\r\n\r\n“Let’s all go together, boys.”\r\n\r\nA few minutes afterwards Syd, with a few others, ventured to look into\r\nthe door, and there stood the actor with his hat upon his head, who,\r\nwith a pleasant smile, inquired of Syd if the stage had run off the\r\nbridge again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOT PREPARED TO GO.]\r\n\r\nSome one asked Syd how he got out. He said that at times he was at\r\nthe top, and sometimes they were five or six deep and he was at the\r\nbottom of the pile, but he managed, by rolling, tumbling and crawling\r\noccasionally, with a hop, skip and a jump, to get outside before the\r\nstove blew up, and acknowledged that Anderson had got even.\r\n\r\nSoon after the hanging of Irish Dick in the fall of ’50, the question\r\nof hanging a culprit in that promiscuous manner was objected to by\r\nmany, and Syd opposed it strongly upon the grounds that, as a general\r\nrule, the hardest characters in the camp would be the first to pull on\r\nthe rope and cry “Hang him!” as was the case when Dick was hung, the\r\nmajority of those who were the most eager to hang him being men of the\r\nlowest class.\r\n\r\nSyd claimed that if a man were to run through the town, followed by\r\nothers who cried “Hang him! Hang him!” this crowd of ignorant barroom\r\nloafers would join in the chase and hang the man, if they caught him,\r\nwithout asking any question, and simply upon general principles and\r\nfrom the excitement of the occasion. To prove this it was agreed that\r\na young man present should run down the street, a few others should\r\nfollow in his wake and cry “Hang him!” The young man started as agreed\r\nupon, and before he reached the corner of Coloma street a dozen barroom\r\nloafers had caught him, and with a rope around his neck were using him\r\nin a very rough manner. No doubt they would have injured him severely,\r\neven if they had not hung him, but for the interference of Syd and\r\nothers, who explained the joke as well as the object in playing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n EMIGRATION OF ’51--CHURCHES ERECTED--MINES DESERTED--THE CHINESE\r\n MINERS--HILL, RIVER AND QUARTZ MINING--NATURE FROWNS--THE COURSE OF\r\n EVENTS CHANGE--FRUIT RAISING--PROSPECTING--ON THE HOME STRETCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the fall of ’51 there was a very heavy emigration across the plains,\r\nfrom the Western States principally, which I heard estimated at 25,000,\r\nbut whether it was as much as this I cannot say. Great numbers, also,\r\nwho had traveled by water during the fall and winter of ’51, came up\r\ninto the mining regions, and the estimate was made that in Eldorado\r\nCounty alone there were in the spring of ’52 fully 30,000 persons,\r\nwhile in the mining regions there were nearly 100,000. Of this number\r\nonly a small proportion engaged in the business of mining, the great\r\nmajority consisting of business men including saloon-keepers, idlers,\r\nloafers, and a large number of sporting men. From observation, I should\r\njudge that less than one-tenth of those who came into the mining\r\nregions up to this time engaged in the business of mining.\r\n\r\nIt was during the spring of this year that the first newspaper, called\r\nthe _Eldorado News_, was started in the mining regions by Harmon &\r\nSpringer. It changed hands in ’52, I think, its name being altered to\r\nthat of _The Mountain Democrat_, under the management of Gilwicks &\r\nPhillips.\r\n\r\nIt was the intention of many up to this time (about ’52 and ’53) to\r\nreturn home after a few years; but now the time had arrived when\r\norchards were blooming upon the hillsides, and the grapevines could\r\nbe seen bending under their luscious burdens, the prevalent question\r\nappearing to be, Why not stay and make our homes here? The society\r\nin the mining regions, as was doubtless the case in the towns and\r\ncities, was somewhat mixed, and at first social conditions were rather\r\nstrained, owing, of course, to the difference in the manners and\r\ncustoms of the natives of the different States and countries from\r\nwhich they had emigrated. This state of affairs did not last long,\r\nhowever, and society soon adapted itself to such changed conditions,\r\nand continued upon a more favorable basis. Churches were erected\r\nin all the chief mining towns by the various denominations; school\r\ndistricts were formed at an earlier day, and school-houses were erected\r\nthroughout the mining counties, not only in the chief towns, but also\r\nin all of the various mining camps that contained children enough to\r\nstart one.\r\n\r\nIn the dry seasons of ’50-’53, when water was scarce in the placer\r\nmining districts, large numbers proceeded to prospect the beds of other\r\nrivers, both north and south, finding that almost every stream, from\r\nthe Klamath, Trinity and Scott rivers of the North, to the Stanislaus\r\nand other rivers of the South, contained gold in paying quantities.\r\nDams, ditches, tail races, wing dams and flumes were built at the most\r\navailable points in the various rivers, and immense fortunes were\r\nrealized by a few persons. River mining partakes of the same nature and\r\ncharacter as other mining, and although the exact location was known\r\nin the river where the rich deposits were to be found, yet the trouble\r\nand expense, as well as the uncertainty and risk in getting it, offset\r\nto a great extent the value of the amount acquired; for, in some cases,\r\nminers were compelled to dam and flue three and even four years in\r\nsuccession before being able to get to work among the pay gravel in the\r\nriver bed.\r\n\r\nFrequent losses were entailed in consequence of the breaking away\r\nof dams, caused by rains in the mountains above coming upon them\r\nunexpectedly and carrying away flumes, tools, etc., just as everything\r\nwas about ready for commencing the work of washing the pay dirt.\r\n\r\nGold mining, under favorable conditions is of a pleasing and exciting\r\nnature, and for this reason has great attraction for many; but such is\r\nthe great uncertainty of success of this method of acquiring wealth,\r\nthat although fully $50,000,000 of gold was being annually extracted\r\nfrom the mines and put into circulation, yet, strange and paradoxical\r\nas it may seem, a few years demonstrated the fact that the class who\r\nextracted the gold from the soil in the dry diggings, from tunnels in\r\nthe old, ancient river beds, as well as from the present water courses,\r\nwere the very ones who had, or who retained in their possession, the\r\nleast amount. It would be natural to suppose, from the nature of\r\nthings, that those who dug the gold should hold or retain in their\r\npossession by far the greater portion of it; the reverse, however, was\r\nthe case, and in a short time the miners, as a class, were the poorest\r\npersons in the State. A few, of course, had acquired fortunes, but\r\nthousands who had, but a short time previously been in possession,\r\nof good paying claims were now barely able to make a living. It is a\r\nmooted question as to why this was, and in what respects the business\r\nof gold mining differed from any other occupation.\r\n\r\nThe true explanation of this paradox, in my opinion, can be traced to\r\nthe great expense attendant upon the business, and to the fact that the\r\noutgo continues at all times, while little or nothing is coming in; an\r\nimportant factor being also an excessive freedom in the use of gold,\r\nfor a miner who has a paying mine does not practice habits of economy;\r\nhe does not know how, and if he ever did it has slipped his memory.\r\n\r\nAs the ravines, gulches and small creeks were now worked out, or at\r\nthat point when they ceased to pay sufficient to warrant working,\r\nthey were entirely abandoned. This gave to the mining regions a very\r\ndesolate appearance; for in certain locations or districts where but\r\na short time previous all was life and animation, and the clatter of\r\nthe shovels upon the tom iron, the rush of water and gravel through\r\nthe long sluices, and the laughter and jollity of the miners at work,\r\nevidencing the fact that fair wages were being made, could be heard,\r\nnow the scene was changed and all was desolate and deserted. The\r\nnumerous old cabins scattered around among the hills were silent, and\r\ntenantless, too; the old chimneys in some places were falling to the\r\nground, and young pine trees were showing themselves among the ruins.\r\n\r\nBut again the scene changes; for now the Asiatic hordes, who had\r\nlearned of the great wealth to be acquired here in so easy a manner,\r\nwere on their way to honor the State with their company, and they\r\nsoon flocked into the mining regions in swarms, well satisfied to\r\nwork over the old abandoned claims left and deserted by others. They\r\nwere welcomed by the mining community with open arms, as it was soon\r\ndiscovered that the Chinese would not preempt, or locate any new mining\r\ngrounds, desiring only to buy at a fair price the old worked-out\r\nclaims which had been abandoned. Here was the grand opportunity of the\r\nminer to re-locate and sell to the Mongolian emigrant these old mining\r\nclaims; and well did these disciples of Confucius merit the title of\r\nscavengers of the mining regions, for many of the old claims which\r\nhad been abandoned as worthless, were not so in fact, as it was soon\r\ndiscovered that from many of them the Chinese miners were taking out\r\nlarge amounts of gold.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese method of working a mining claim differed very materially\r\nfrom our own, being of a more systematic character. It was their\r\npractice to commence and take everything clean as they went, leaving\r\nnot an inch of ground behind them unworked. They are very slow workers\r\nas compared with other races, but sure and steady, illustrating by\r\ntheir success in working these old claims the truth of the old adage\r\nthat it is the steady mill that grinds the corn. So thorough was their\r\nwork, that it would be entirely useless and a waste of time to work\r\nover any mining grounds that have been previously worked by a Chinese\r\ncompany, for they got it all.\r\n\r\nSome attempts to prevent the ingress of the Chinese into the mining\r\nregions by levying or enforcing the previously adopted “Foreign Miners’\r\nTax,” were made; but this they paid without a murmur, and in many cases\r\ntwo or three times over, for it was often the custom of some to go\r\namong them with fictitious papers, and collect their taxes in advance\r\nof the regularly licensed collector.\r\n\r\nIn the summers of ’53-’54, those who still continued in the occupation\r\nof mining, turned their attention chiefly to river and hill mining,\r\nreturning to the rivers in the dry season and to their hill claims\r\nin the fall, after the rivers had risen, and rendered such mining\r\nimpracticable. Tunnels were run into the old river channels in all\r\ndirections; with varying success, however, some being a perfect\r\nfailure, whilst from others fortunes were realized. Among the richest\r\nof these were the forest hill claims, where was found the celebrated\r\nblue gravel lead, this being discovered principally amid the ancient\r\nriver beds, in the central and northern mining regions of the State,\r\nbut small sections of it ever having been found through the southern\r\nportions. These hill claims were very extensive, and many throughout\r\nthe mining regions, upon which work was commenced nearly thirty-eight\r\nyears ago, are yet being worked with success. The same manner of\r\nworking as originally, by drifting, is still in vogue, although the\r\ngravel, instead of being washed as it was at that time, is now crushed\r\nin mills in the same manner as quartz, and with greater profit. Many\r\nof these old abandoned hill claims, from which the gravel had been\r\npreviously drifted, were afterwards washed away by the hydraulic\r\nprocess, with good success.\r\n\r\nThis process of mining commenced, I think, in some of the mines in the\r\nspring of ’52, and such was found to be the great advantage of the\r\nmethod, and the facility with which whole hills could be removed from\r\ntheir foundations and carefully and evenly deposited among the farms\r\nin the low counties, leaving, of course, the gold behind, that it came\r\ninto general use throughout the mining regions wherever sufficient fall\r\nand water could be obtained. Old abandoned mines were by this process\r\nmade very remunerative, as was the case also with many ravines and\r\nflats which could be washed to advantage, without regard to the rights\r\nof those who had fenced in and improved their garden spots with fruit\r\ntrees, vines and flower-beds.\r\n\r\nIt was the general opinion of the great majority of the mining classes,\r\nfrom about the year ’51, that this was exclusively a mining country;\r\nthat it was fit for nothing else, and that no man had a right to\r\nquestion this opinion, or to build upon, or to fence in, any portion of\r\nthe soil for any other purpose whatsoever for his own individual use,\r\nthat a miner was bound to respect. This idea yet exists in the minds of\r\nmany, or at least of that portion who are engaged in hydraulic mining,\r\nfor in their opinion the business of mining, being the first and\r\noriginal industry of the country, must have precedence over all other\r\nkinds of business, and of course this priority gives them the right to\r\nfill up, cover up, and destroy the property of the farmers below who\r\nwere foolish enough to get in the way.\r\n\r\nIt was some time during the early spring of ’52, that mining men and\r\ngeologists turned their attention to the various quartz ledges which\r\nwere found projecting above the surface of the ground among the hills,\r\nmany of which, upon examination, proved to be very rich in gold.\r\nThe opinion soon became general, and a well-demonstrated fact, that\r\nall gold found among the ravines, flats, hills and river beds, came\r\noriginally from these same quartz ledges, and that locked within the\r\nsolid quartz, in the finest of particles, was its original condition.\r\nIn consequence of volcanic eruptions and glacial action the hills and\r\nledges had, in course of ages, been broken up and worn away to their\r\npresent elevation, the gold therefrom having been scattered by the\r\nforce of the rushing waters among the ravines and river beds, where it\r\nis now found.\r\n\r\nIn ’53 the erection of quartz mills commenced, and soon the crash and\r\nrattle of their stamps could be heard echoing among the hills and\r\ncañons. In the first excitement of quartz mining, mills were erected\r\nupon all ledges which showed the least appearance of containing gold,\r\nbut it was soon discovered that the greater portion of them did not\r\npay expenses. The consequence was, it is safe to say, that hundreds of\r\nmills were idle in a year hence, and the valuable machinery was left to\r\nrust and decay. In the case, however, of many of these old abandoned\r\nledges, further prospecting at lower depth proved them to be of value,\r\nand many of them at the present time are being worked with profit,\r\nowing to the improved methods of saving the gold.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that gold mining was not a legitimate business, and\r\nthat the intense desire for gold created unnatural conditions. But\r\nobservation and experience show us that the happiness of the human\r\nfamily, as well as the grade of civilization to which it is possible\r\nto attain, depends upon the quantity of gold which it is possible to\r\nacquire, and its proper use. Without gold in what would life consist?\r\nWhat would be its chief aim and consideration? Why, there wouldn’t\r\nbe any aim at all, for there wouldn’t be any target worth the aiming\r\nat. It was the desire to possess this precious metal that prompted\r\nthousands of us to undertake such a long, wearisome, and dangerous\r\njourney around those gigantic obstructions at the extreme end of the\r\ncontinent, as well as a tedious journey across the barren deserts. It\r\nis this desire, also, or incentive, which builds our great cities,\r\nour great manufacturing industries, as well as our railroads and\r\nsteamships; proving conclusively, in my opinion, that the individual\r\nwho first invented and threw to the breeze the old saying that money\r\nmakes the mare go understood the whole business.\r\n\r\nBut why should gold in such vast quantities be scattered here upon\r\nthe western portion of our continent, and why was Nature so partial\r\nin the distribution of her favors? Was it accidental, the effect\r\nof chance conditions, or was it designed for some special purpose?\r\nThe latter is the more reasonable, and therefore the more probable,\r\ntheory, for observation shows us that Nature frowns upon unbalanced\r\nconditions, and that here, upon the western slope of the continent,\r\nlying silent and deserted, was an earthly paradise, unthought of, and\r\nas yet unknown except by a few, while at the East vast numbers were\r\nsettling and making their homes amid the snowbanks and blizzards of\r\nan Arctic climate, totally unconscious of what the conditions were\r\nat the far West, beneath the setting sun. Under such conditions it\r\nis very easy to understand why Nature frowns. It is very true, as we\r\nhad been previously informed, and rightly too, that Westward the Star\r\nof Empire takes its way; yet, by the natural process of settlement\r\nit would have required hundreds of years, perhaps, to colonize and\r\nto settle up this portion of our continent, and properly balance the\r\nconditions of increased population. It was for this purpose, no doubt,\r\nthat the knowledge of the existence of gold upon the western portion\r\nof our continent was reserved for the Anglo-Saxon race, who understood\r\nits real value and knew how to use it as an incentive for the proper\r\nadjustment of unbalanced conditions; and we have come as the pioneers\r\nof an advancing civilization, intending to grow up with the country\r\nand to use our best endeavors (by all legitimate means) to restore the\r\nequilibrium by an increase in population.\r\n\r\nThe hills, rivers and ravines still continued to give forth their\r\nvaluable treasure; but one fact was very evident, and that was that but\r\na very small proportion of it remained in the mining regions. There\r\nwas a continuous current of gold flowing into the chief city by the\r\nsea, and but a very small portion of it returning to the miners, who\r\nby their labor extracted it from the earth. Business men, also, among\r\nthe various mining camps in the gold regions, who had succeeded in\r\naccumulating a reasonable amount, followed in the wake of this current\r\nto the big city, there to use and spend their earnings, and none, or at\r\nleast but a very few, seemed willing to continue to live in and improve\r\nthat portion of the country where they had won success.\r\n\r\nThe continuous flow of gold concentrated, therefore, in the hands of\r\ncomparatively few men, and San Francisco became the head-center for\r\nall comers who desired to secure a portion of the golden stream. And\r\nnow the city which, but a few years previous, was a mere cluster of\r\nsand-hills, began to assume the form and appearance of a great city, or\r\nthe foundation upon which a metropolis was to be built.\r\n\r\nThroughout the dry or placer mining regions, numerous towns and\r\nvillages had grown up which in a few years assumed conditions of\r\nconsiderable importance under the impression that such mining would be\r\nof a more lasting and permanent character. It required but a few years,\r\nhowever, to demonstrate the fact that such mining was of a transient\r\nnature; the gold in the ravines, gulches, flats and benches, as well\r\nas in the small and shallow creeks, was soon extracted, what was left\r\nby the American miner in his hasty and careless method of working\r\nbeing subsequently thoroughly cleaned out by the Chinese miners. These\r\nsections being now almost entirely deserted by the miners, the business\r\nmen and families in the towns and villages were forced to abandon them,\r\ntheir homes and property soon falling into decay.\r\n\r\nA journey through these deserted and now silent villages, which but a\r\nfew short years previous were full of life and animation, presents to\r\nthe mind a scene which can only be paralleled by the New Zealander of\r\nthe future, sitting upon the ruins of London Bridge, speculating upon\r\nthe vicissitudes and the uncertainties of human affairs, especially\r\nin gold mining, and further illustrates the fact that although it is\r\ngold itself that forms the great incentive for building up our towns\r\nand cities, yet the precious metal does not possess the power to built\r\nup, or improve, the portions of the country in which it is found;\r\nbut seemingly produces a contrary effect. It was for these reasons,\r\nthat upon the placer mines being worked out, the various towns and\r\nvillages soon went to decay; the country presenting a very desolate and\r\ndeserted appearance. This desolation would have increased as the mines\r\nbecame exhausted, and in course of time the whole mining region would\r\nhave been silent and deserted, but for the important discovery having\r\nbeen made that the abandoned mining regions possessed a value for\r\nagricultural purposes far superior, of a more permanent character, and\r\nof greater value to the human family in general than the gold beneath\r\nthe surface. To this cause can be attributed the change in the course\r\nof events, as well as the character of the country, and which also\r\nwill in time be the means of transforming the now silent and deserted\r\nportions of the mining regions into populous and thriving settlements.\r\n\r\nAs the various mines became exhausted of their wealth, and the once\r\nprosperous villages were abandoned and left to decay, the gambling\r\nclasses, and the gentlemen of elegant leisure were also\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MINING GROUND TRANSFORMED.]\r\n\r\nforced to leave for other more populous sections--the greater portion\r\nof them following the golden current to the head-centers of population,\r\n_i. e._, the great cities below. Many, however, abandoned their\r\ncalling, and becoming desperate engaged in the business of mining. A\r\nfew, however, turned their attention to what in their opinion seemed\r\nthe most remunerative, and most in accordance with their natures: they\r\nbecame travelling stage agents, upon the various routes throughout\r\nthe mining regions; inspecting the various coaches which they met in\r\nlonesome out-of-way places. When found to be overloaded with a larger\r\namount or weight of precious metal than the law allows in such cases,\r\nthese vehicles would be relieved of the surplus, and in many cases a\r\nlittle more besides. The greater number of this gentry were, however,\r\nin course of time captured through the vigilance of certain well-known\r\nand energetic detectives, such as J. Hume and a few others.\r\n\r\nIn a few short years the placer diggings were almost entirely\r\nexhausted, and, as before mentioned, the annual yield of gold had been\r\nsomewhat reduced in consequence; but the yield from the ancient river\r\nbeds will, no doubt, remain a constant quantity for many long years,\r\nuntil they also become exhausted, or the profits becoming too small\r\nwill lead to their abandonment, and ultimately fall into the hands of\r\nthe Mongolian race, which will, doubtless, continue working them for\r\nthe next three hundred years at least. Quartz mining, however, is of\r\na different nature, and in consequence of the great number of ledges\r\nthroughout the State, as well as the great depth in which gold-bearing\r\nquartz has been found, many ages will be required to entirely exhaust\r\nthem, amounting doubtless to hundreds of years, or as long, perhaps, as\r\ngold is used for the purposes of exchange.\r\n\r\nAfter a residence here among the hills of the mining regions of\r\nsix or seven years’ duration, we had acquired a knowledge of the\r\npeculiarities of the climate of the country, the time of the changes of\r\nits seasons from wet to dry, and vice versa, and we found that there\r\nwas no uniformity in the various changes, and no possible manner of\r\nforetelling what the following winter or its nature would be; whether\r\nit would be a wet or a dry one, or what the nature of the following\r\ndry season was to be. No two seasons were alike, but differed in many\r\nrespects from all preceding ones. The Indians, however, pretended to\r\nhave discovered a means of forecasting the nature of the following\r\nwinters, but they missed it occasionally. It was also claimed that the\r\nsquirrels were endowed with foresight, and would lay in a winter’s\r\nsupply accordingly. These, too, missed it occasionally, from which fact\r\nit was evident, as the oldest inhabitant was forced to admit upon his\r\ndying bed, that no sure means of prognosticating the future condition\r\nof the weather in California were possible.\r\n\r\nThe rains commenced in the mining regions usually about the last of\r\nOctober, and continued at intervals throughout the season until on or\r\nabout April 10th, and occasionally, with a few light showers thrown in\r\nas good measure, up to the 20th. These rainy seasons throughout the\r\ncentral portion of the mining regions were usually warm and pleasant,\r\nwith but very little snow and ice, and, with the exception of a few\r\ndays towards the last of December, mining could be continued throughout\r\nthe year. The dry seasons, in some localities, were very hot for a\r\nshort time during July and August, but the nights, however, in the\r\nhottest of weather were invariably cool.\r\n\r\nThe orchards and vineyards were about this time coming into bearing,\r\ndemonstrating the fact that the soil was well adapted to fruit growing.\r\nMany of the ravines and flats, from which the soil had previously been\r\nwashed away in the search for gold, were by means of brush dams again\r\nfilled up to a proper level by the muddy streams from mining claims\r\nhigher up, and converted into rich garden spots, giving an appearance\r\nsimilar to the older, settled portions of our country. It soon became\r\napparent that fruit raising could be made remunerative, and hundreds\r\nof miners throughout the central portions of the mining regions turned\r\ntheir attention to this new and profitable industry. Orchards and\r\nvineyards in a few short years could be found blooming upon every\r\navailable point where water for irrigation could be obtained; upon\r\nflats, benches and slides, and even in some cases upon the tops of the\r\nhighest hills, for up here the soil was of a lighter character and\r\nbetter adapted to the vine than that of lower and colder localities.\r\nThe long, dry summer seasons here are well adapted to fruit raising,\r\nand it was soon found that tropical fruits would mature and ripen in\r\ncertain well-protected localities, such, for instance, as the orange,\r\nlemon and fig.\r\n\r\nVarious flowering plants, also, which in much lower latitudes of the\r\nAtlantic slope can only be raised in hot-houses, are here an ordinary\r\ngarden plant, and but very seldom injured by the frosts of spring.\r\nThe long, dry summers and cloudless skies are to the new comers an\r\nagreeable contrast with those at the East, and for a few years are\r\nvery enjoyable, but in time become monotonous to those who were born\r\nand raised under less favorable conditions in colder climates, many\r\nbecoming wearied at the continuance of such a long and cloudless\r\natmosphere, which in some seasons embraces a period of eight to ten\r\nmonths. They seem to pine for other conditions, where heavy rains,\r\nhailstorms and cyclones are frequent and break the monotony of the\r\nscene. This desire for a change is a disease, the remedy for which is\r\nwell known, for many who have returned to their Eastern homes to be\r\ncured have again wended their way to California, perfectly convalescent\r\nafter spending one short year away, satisfied and content and willing\r\nto endure the tedious monotony of eight long months beneath the\r\ncloudless skies here, rather than to risk an unequal contest with the\r\nblizzards and cyclones of an Eastern winter.\r\n\r\nThe mining classes are usually of a restless nature and ready to wander\r\nforth at any time in search of new fields, and will, as it has been\r\nproved in the earlier experiences of Gold Bluff, Salmon and the Snake\r\nRiver excitement, as well as in the more recent discoveries of Frazer\r\nRiver, British Columbia and Montana, abandon ranches and good paying\r\nmines, carried away by the anticipation of finding away yonder rich\r\nmines and better pay than can be found nearer home. But the greater\r\nportion eventually return, satisfied that small wages at home are\r\nbetter than searching among the mountain ranges of other sections\r\nof the country for uncertainties. In the course of some eight years\r\nfrom the first discovery of gold in California, the entire country,\r\nextending from Arizona and New Mexico on the south, up through the\r\nBritish possessions to the Alaska line on the north, and as far as the\r\nBlack Hills at the east, were traveled over and prospected by various\r\ncompanies of miners who were in search of another Eldorado. Although\r\nmany rich localities were discovered from which a great amount of\r\ngold was extracted, yet the mines were spotted, the gold generally\r\nat a great depth and confined to a few gulches or ravines only,\r\ndemonstrating the fact that no other portion of the earth’s surface, at\r\nleast upon our own continent, will ever be discovered where the gold is\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DESERTED CAMP.]\r\n\r\ndistributed so uniformly over the surface among the numerous ravines,\r\nrivers and gulches, and in such immense quantities, as was found to be\r\nthe case in California. In fact, I doubt the existence of a similar\r\ndeposit and of such an extent, anywhere upon the earth’s surface.\r\nNeither has there been so far discovered anywhere upon the Pacific\r\nCoast mining districts that contain within their limits such a vast\r\nnumber of quartz ledges bearing free gold in paying quantities, as can\r\nbe found in the mining regions of California at the present time.\r\n\r\nI have stated that the majority of the residents of California, at\r\nleast in the mining regions, had now become well satisfied with\r\ntheir adopted home, and intended to remain; but there were a few,\r\nnevertheless, who still pined for their Eastern home, for various\r\nreasons. For instance.\r\n\r\nI chanced to meet a family one day upon the emigrant road, evidently\r\nupon their return journey. It was during the spring of ’57. The family\r\nwas composed of an old man and his wife, the former driving a yoke of\r\ncattle hitched to a regular emigrant wagon covered, and with all the\r\ntrimmings usually found in connection with an emigrant team. It was so\r\nunusual to see a team of this description headed for the East that,\r\nfrom curiosity, I inquired of them whither they were bound:\r\n\r\n“Wall, stranger,” the old man replied, “me an’ the ole woman air\r\na-gwine away from hyar. We air on the homestretch to ole Missouri agin,\r\nwhar we cum frum nigh on ter ten years ago.”\r\n\r\nHe explained further, that many years before he and his wife had become\r\nimbued with a desire to retire to some secluded place, to live in\r\nsolitude away from the noise and confusion of society, and where, as he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“We cud jest enj’y outsels, an’ raise lots o’ chickens without\r\ninterferin’ with anybody.”\r\n\r\nSo they moved away out West, and made their home in solitude upon the\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\n“Wall stranger that wus a rale quiet place out thar fur a spell; but\r\njest as soon as they diskivered gold out’n California, the jig were up,\r\nfer all them chaps, who wus a-goin’ thar, come right along my way, and\r\njust shoved that air frontier of ourn right along ahead of ’em t’ards\r\nthe West. So one mornin’ Nancy ses to me, ses she, ‘Hiram! Hiram! ef we\r\nair a-gwine to enj’y a solitude along with a frontier\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NO MORE FRONTIER IN OURN.]\r\n\r\nwe mus’ git away from hyer, t’ards the West, and git a leetle ahead of\r\nall them fellers.’ ‘Thet’s so Nancy,’ ses I, ‘an’ ef you back pu ther\r\nduds, I’ll call ther chickens, hitch up ther team an’ load ther wagin,\r\nand we’ll git ahead on ’em and diskiver another frontier somewhar.’\r\nBut durn my buttons, stranger, we’ve been tryin’ to git a leetle ahead\r\non ’em ever sence. But ’taint no use. We thot we hed struck a frontier\r\nin Californy agin’ fur sartin, when we fust got thar; but one mornin’\r\narter we hed hed a long wet spell, the fust thing I seen when I got up\r\nwus a steamboat right in ther back-yard. So ses I, ‘Nancy, Nancy, hyer\r\nthey air jest a comin’ agin’. So we loaded our traps in the wagin, and\r\nwent over ther mountains whar the ocean is, an’ we jest thot that we\r\nhed got it now fur shure; fur hyer was a sort o’ a nat’ral frontier\r\nthat wouldn’t stan’ any pushin’. So we ontied the chickens an’ got\r\nready, kind o’ hum like, when one mornin’ we heerd the awflest n’ise,\r\nand wen we went out, durned if thar wern’t a saw-mill right back of\r\nour chicken house, an’ they were jest buildin’ ’nother one ’cross the\r\ncreek, and some ships was a-sailin’ along in frum ther ocean to load up\r\nther lumber. Now Nancy never did like saw-mills. Sed she’d rather hear\r\nit thunder enny day, ’cause the sawin’ n’ise sets her teeth on aidge\r\nso. On’y she haint got a nat’ral tooth in her hed annyhow.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said I, “where did you go next?”\r\n\r\n“Wall,” the old lady replied, “we thot we mought try it further north\r\nfur a spell, so we moseyed ’long up thru Oregin, an’ ’way off up inter\r\nIdyho; whar we foun’ a frontier at las’, fur sartin. An’ I reckon\r\n’twill stay that fur a spell, too. We stayed on’t a hull year, but had\r\nto git off on’t agin on ’count of ther chickens.”\r\n\r\nI asked her the reason.\r\n\r\n“Oh, shucks,” she replied, “a sawmill was nothin’ t’ ther racket up\r\nthar, an’ I’ll tell ye how it wuz. Yer see, in ther winter ’tis tornal\r\ncold, an’ ther roosters couldn’t crow, fur yer see jest as they ’gun to\r\ncrow it all fruz harder’n a icicle, so jest soon’s spring’s thaw cum\r\non, why all their crowin’s thet wuz fruz in ther winter ’gun t’ chirp,\r\nand sich a crowin’ time ye never heerd in all yer born days. An’ fur\r\nmor’n two weeks me nur Hiram didn’t sleep blessed wink. Well, stranger,\r\nwe jist packed up agin, and thot we’d try the southern kintry, ’mong\r\nth’ cactuses in th’ sandy desert down in Aryzony.

Now\r\nwe’ll go back to ole Missoury agin, whar we kin git suthin’ fit ter\r\neat, anyhow, an’ we’ll try an’ stub thru ther rest o’ our days ’thout\r\nenny frontier in our’n.”\r\n\r\nI asked the old lady if she could not find anything fit to eat in\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yaas, sich as ’tis; but nuthin’ ter wat we kin git in Missoury,”\r\nshe replied.\r\n\r\nWhen I inquired of her what it was that she could get to eat there\r\nthat was so much better than anything to be found in California, she\r\nanswered,\r\n\r\n“Wall, stranger, yer never ett poke-greens’n bacon down in Missoury,\r\nfur if yer hed yer never wud a-ax’d sich a question.”\r\n\r\nI asked the old man what he thought of California, anyhow.\r\n\r\n“Wall,” he replied, “‘tis a big kintry, and I tell yer ’twon’t be long\r\nafore ther’ll be a powerful heap er folks a-livin’ all over, thicker’n\r\nrats in Sacrymenty City” (“Yaas, or fleas in San Frixo,” interjected\r\nNancy), “but when yer cum to talk about yer climate, there aint none\r\nt’compare with climate in ole Missoury.

The mines of California contain\r\ngold principally, but small quantities of silver being found, and in a\r\nfew locations only mines of copper, although, except in a few cases,\r\nnot in paying quantities. In the State adjoining, however, upon the\r\neastern slope of the Nevada range, the rule was reversed, the principal\r\ncharacter of the ore being of silver, but small quantities of gold\r\nhaving been so far discovered.\r\n\r\nThe excitement throughout the mining regions was intense, and thousands\r\ncould be seen upon the various roads on their way to the new Eldorado.\r\nHundreds deserted their ranches, miners forsaking their claims, and\r\nbusiness men and mechanics also joining in the almost universal\r\nstampede. At the commencement of the silver mining industry it could\r\nnot, for the want of proper machinery and facilities for working the\r\nores, be reduced or worked on the Pacific Coast, and it therefore\r\nbecame necessary to export it to other portions of the country for the\r\npurpose. The ore was packed in sacks, placed upon the backs of mules,\r\nand in this manner transported across the mountains to San Francisco,\r\nfrom whence it was shipped to the various reduction works in New\r\nJersey, or to Swansea, Wales. In a short time, long trains of mules\r\nheavily laden with the valuable silver ore could almost daily be seen\r\nwending their way slowly but surely among the rocks and over steep\r\ndeclivities of the mountains, destined for the sea coast.\r\n\r\nThe roads through the mining regions were rough, and across the\r\nmountains steep and precipitous, it being almost impossible to convey\r\nfreight or supplies into the silver mines, except upon the backs of\r\nmules. This state of affairs was soon changed, however, for roads\r\nwere immediately commenced, starting from a point a few miles above\r\nPlacerville, a system of toll roads being constructed across the\r\nmountains nearly one hundred miles in extent. The completion of these\r\nroads changed, in a short time, the character of the silver mining\r\nindustry; for by means of them, all the necessary machinery for working\r\nthe rich ores could easily be transported across the mountains from the\r\nfoundries and work shops of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nSoon were seen long trains of heavily laden wagons, drawn by mules,\r\ncontaining an endless assortment of iron wheels, pulleys, boilers,\r\nsmoke-stacks and enormous fly-wheels, as well as all of the various\r\ntools and parts of machinery necessary for the working of the mines.\r\nHeavily loaded “schooners” also, drawn in some instances by twelve\r\nlarge mules, could often be seen in large numbers stringing along the\r\nroad for miles, laden with household goods, hardware, groceries and\r\nprovisions for the use of the vast numbers who had congregated there\r\nand were engaged in mining, prospecting, and also in laying foundations\r\nof the principal town, Virginia City.\r\n\r\nThese toll roads were grand affairs; broad, smooth and as hard as a\r\nfloor, for they were kept well watered by regular water carts, which\r\nbeing filled from the numerous springs by the roadside, traveled back\r\nand forth, sprinkling them thoroughly. This road, during the dry\r\nseason and when not encumbered by heavy snows upon the summit of the\r\nmountains, for several years presented the appearance of a busy street\r\nin some cities. Men on foot, and vehicles of all descriptions, were\r\ncontinually passing in one direction or the other. For the convenience\r\nof this immense traffic, houses, barrooms and way stations for the\r\naccommodation of teamsters and travelers, were necessary and numerous,\r\nbeing situated but a short distance apart along the entire length of\r\nthe road. Some of them were fine and costly buildings, while others,\r\nagain, were of the cheapest character.\r\n\r\nThis also was the regular stage road, from Sacramento City through\r\nPlacerville. During the summers of ’58-’59 the travel over this stage\r\nroute was very heavy, and for a greater portion of the time two and\r\nthree stages loaded with passengers left Placerville daily for the\r\nsilver mines. To drive a stage upon this route the most expert drivers\r\nwere required; sober and steady men who had great presence of mind,\r\nfor upon these qualities the lives of a load of passengers, numbering\r\nin some instances as many as eighteen or twenty persons, depended, and\r\namong them would always be found a few ladies and children. The horses\r\nused were usually of a Spanish mustang breed, the wheelers generally\r\nbeing old and steady American horses. Six horses was the usual number\r\nrequired, and the leaders being, as was often the case, only half\r\nbroken, untamed mustangs, it required drivers who thoroughly understood\r\ntheir business.\r\n\r\nAmong these experienced drivers, and the most prominent, was the one\r\nwho brought Horace Greeley through on time, Hank Monk, and who had the\r\nreputation of being one of the most expert drivers on the coast; he\r\ndied recently in Carson City. Hank Monk was what is termed among stage\r\nmen a lucky driver, seldom meeting with an accident and no passenger\r\never having been injured who rode with him. If an accident ever did\r\nhappen to him upon his route, he kept cool, puffed his cigar, and kept\r\nhis own counsel.\r\n\r\nA passenger, who on one occasion occupied an outside seat, relates\r\nthat in descending the steep grade from the mountain side into Carson\r\nValley, and when within about a half-mile of the foot of the grade,\r\nthe brake bar gave way. The stage, with its load of passengers, rolled\r\nforward upon the wheelers, but Hank took an extra turn of the line\r\naround his hands, held his cigar firmly between his clenched teeth,\r\nand speaking quietly to his mustang leaders said, “Gerlang! gerlang!”\r\nand they certainly did, for never in the history of staging was faster\r\ntime made down that or any other grade. The passenger sitting beside\r\nhim became frightened and started to jump, but Monk said, “Set still!”\r\nwhich fortunately for him he did. The passengers inside were frightened\r\nat the rate of speed with which the descent was being made, and not\r\nknowing the cause of it naturally supposed that some accident had\r\nhappened to the driver. One of them, therefore, upon thrusting his head\r\nout of the window to reconnoitre, met the smiling countenance of Monk,\r\nand quieted the fears of his fellow passengers by remarking:\r\n\r\n“We are making pretty fast time; but Hank Monk has hold of the lines,\r\nand it’s all right anyhow.”\r\n\r\nThe running wild mustangs were guided safely to the level valley below,\r\nand brought to a standstill in front of the hotel for lunch. When asked\r\nby some of the passengers why he drove so furiously\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I’VE TIME FOR LUNCH.]\r\n\r\ndown that grade, he replied that he was a little behindhand for lunch,\r\nthat was all.\r\n\r\nThere were other stage-drivers also who drove upon this mountain\r\nroad, although not so well known perhaps as Monk, yet who had high\r\nreputations as expert drivers. Among them were Watson and Nelson. There\r\nwas another one, who, if not so expert as a driver, and possibly did\r\nnot acquire so great a notoriety in the business as others, at least\r\nwhen alive, created a greater astonishment at death, and this was\r\nCharley, the noted stage-driver who had followed the business of stage\r\ndriving for some years upon various roads throughout the State, and\r\nupon whose death, which occurred only recently, it was discovered that\r\nthe noted stage-driver was a woman.\r\n\r\nIt could hardly be expected that a well-traveled road like this,\r\nover which so much treasure was being transported, and where so many\r\nteamsters were returning with their freight money about them, should be\r\nfree from the inquisitive eye of the road agent, although it was for a\r\nwhile. The temptation, however, in a short time became too great, and\r\nthe unusual facilities for operating this species of industry rendered\r\nthe conditions such that it followed from necessity. The business of\r\ncertain classes of the sporting fraternity among the small towns of\r\nthe mining regions, had at this time become almost entirely destroyed,\r\nand many of them in their desperation had actually gone to work. But\r\nwith the opening of this new road, with its immense travel and unusual\r\nfacilities, other opportunities of a little better nature than hard\r\nwork were brought into existence; and the result was that many availed\r\nthemselves of them. Teamsters were robbed of their well-earned freight\r\nmoney; travelers on foot, on horseback, and under all conditions, were\r\nrelieved of their surplus at all points, and at all hours of the day or\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nIt was often amusing, as well as very instructive, to stop by chance at\r\nsome large hotel where a number of travelers and teamsters had put up\r\nfor the night, and hear their stories of how they were ordered to stop\r\nand pungle by these knights of the road.\r\n\r\nIt happened upon one occasion that I stopped for the night at Yank’s\r\nHotel in Lake Valley. There were about forty teamsters stopping over\r\nfor the night, and they commenced relating their experiences. Several\r\nhad been relieved of their freight money quite recently, and they\r\nexplained, in very graphic language, just where, when, and how it was\r\ndone. One teamster present was called by his\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLEY, THE FEMALE STAGE-DRIVER.]\r\n\r\nbrother teamsters “Big George,” and well he merited the name, for\r\nhe was a large, powerful man, and drove a twelve-mule bell team. He\r\nmade it his boast that these chaps on the road knew enough to let him\r\nalone, for up to this time he had never been troubled by them; but,\r\nsingularly enough, upon his return from this very trip he was robbed of\r\nhis freight money, amounting to something over $500. On his way home he\r\ntook the Dutch Flat road, and was robbed within half a mile of the town\r\nof Marysville.\r\n\r\nBy coincidence, about two weeks later the same crowd of teamsters,\r\nincluding “Big George,” I being present also, met again at the same\r\nhotel in Lake Valley for the night, and now the remark of “Ah, George,\r\nthey know enough to let me alone!” would be heard from various ones.\r\nAfter hearing this repeated a number of times, George said that he\r\nwould give up, they were too much for him, and upon request he gave a\r\nvery graphic description of the whole affair. He stated that when he\r\nwas within sight of the town, which was visible a short distance ahead,\r\nit was about sundown and he was seated away up in his accustomed place\r\nupon his sheepskin, and that just as the wagon was opposite a great\r\nboulder which had slid down from the bank above partly obstructing the\r\nroad, a little bit of a black-eyed cuss, who wasn’t much bigger than a\r\ngood sized cud of tobacco, jumped from behind it, and placing his foot\r\nupon the hub of the forward wheel, at the same time pointing the muzzle\r\nof an immense revolver up towards George, commanded him to stop the\r\nteam.\r\n\r\n“Well, boys, I stopped them,” said George, “but at the same time I put\r\nmy hand upon my revolver, which was lying all cocked and ready for\r\nbusiness right under the sheepskin. He knew pretty well what I was\r\ngoing down there after, you bet, so he jumped on the hub of the wheel\r\nand shoved his howitzer close up to my eyes and right down into the\r\nbarrel I could see the big leaden balls. They appeared to me to be as\r\nbig as my fist, and just squirming to get at me. Says he, ‘Take your\r\nhand off of that,’ and I did. Then the little cuss, says he, ‘Put your\r\npurse into my hand.’ At the same time extending it up towards me.”\r\n\r\n“Well, George, what did you do then?” some one asked.\r\n\r\n“I just kept my eye down in the barrel of that six pounder, took out my\r\npurse from under the sheepskin carefully and tenderly, for I did hate\r\nto give it up to such a little insignificant squib as he\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIG GEORGE AND THE LITTLE ROAD AGENT.]\r\n\r\nwas, but ’twas no use. I just reached over and laid it gently into\r\nhis hand, like a little man. He jumped down, thanked me kindly, and\r\nremarked as it was getting late I had better hurry up or I would lose\r\nmy supper.”\r\n\r\nMany were the incidents related by these teamsters of their various\r\nexperiences with the road agents and how they escaped, for at this time\r\nmany, for fear of robbery, would express their money over, or take in\r\nits stead a check which they would have cashed in San Francisco or in\r\nSacramento City upon their return home.\r\n\r\nA gentleman was driving a buggy on his way from Dutch Flat to Virginia\r\nCity, when, near his destination, he was stopped by a man; a pistol\r\nwas presented, and the usual formalities were gone through with as is\r\nnecessary in such cases. The gentleman handed over a $20 gold piece,\r\nat the same time remarking that he was very sorry, but that was all he\r\nhappened to have with him. He noticed in handing it over to the road\r\nagent that the latter appeared to be very nervous and frightened, and\r\nhe remarked to him that he believed he was new to the business. The\r\nagent answered that he was and that it was his first offense, and that\r\nhe only did it from absolute necessity. Upon being further questioned,\r\nhe stated that he had worked for a whole year in a livery stable as\r\nhostler in a town not far away; that the livery stable keeper failed,\r\nand he never received a single dollar. Upon further inquiry it was\r\nlearned that he had a young wife and two small children living in the\r\nState of Ohio.\r\n\r\n“They are really suffering, and, by George,” he said, “I was determined\r\nto raise money somehow to send them.”\r\n\r\nThe gentleman then informed him that he himself kept a livery stable,\r\nand promised to give him a good job if he would get into the buggy with\r\nhim. After some persuasion he did so, and it was afterwards stated\r\nthat he proved to be a faithful and competent man, remaining there in\r\nthe Samaritan’s employ for nearly four years, and the gentleman never\r\nstated the facts of the case until after the hostler had returned to\r\nhis family in the East.\r\n\r\nThere were numerous incidents of a similar character constantly\r\noccurring on this road.\r\n\r\nA tall, lean and lank specimen of a Downeaster, who was engaged in\r\nmining, was very leisurely walking along the road one Sunday afternoon\r\non his way home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROAD AGENT OUTWITTED.]\r\n\r\nHe had been out visiting among some of his lady acquaintances and\r\nwas dressed in the regulation store-clothes style; in place of a\r\ncollar, however, he wore a plain white handkerchief for a necktie. In\r\nconsequence of a close resemblance to a certain minister of the gospel\r\nwho frequently visited that part of the country, he was called by all\r\nhis acquaintances “the parson.” All at once one of these polite road\r\nagents stepped out from behind a tree, and, presenting his weapon,\r\ndemanded the “parson’s” money instantly, or off would come the top of\r\nhis head. Now, the parson was totally unprepared for such an encounter,\r\nand as he had in his pocket a purse containing about $250, which he\r\ndidn’t like to part with without a struggle, the question suggested\r\nitself at once as to how he could save it. An idea occurred to him, and\r\nthe fact of his being called a parson could now be made good use of,\r\nsince he was well aware that he very much resembled one. Especially\r\nwas this true when dressed up with his old-fashioned black coat and\r\nhis white necktie, and they saved him. He replied to the demand in\r\na drawling tone, that unfortunately the profession in which he was\r\nengaged didn’t enable him to carry about much money, but that he had a\r\nprayer-book which might be sold for a trifle, at the same time putting\r\nhis hand into his coat pocket for the book. The agent, ordering him\r\nto take his hand from his pocket, again repeated his demand, or off\r\nwould come his head and at once, if he didn’t hand over. Then says the\r\nparson, in his drawling style:\r\n\r\n“If I must go hence, first let me pray, won’t ye?” at the same time\r\nkneeling down in the proper attitude.\r\n\r\nThe road agent, being now satisfied that he had sure enough struck a\r\ngenuine parson, turned in disgust and remarked as he went away:\r\n\r\n“Oh, pray away all night, if you like, and be d---- d!”\r\n\r\nBut this little incident, like many others which often occur among the\r\nparsons, has a sequel.\r\n\r\nSome four years later, in Sacramento City, the parson and some of\r\nhis acquaintances were enjoying themselves as miners usually do when\r\nvisiting the large cities in the barroom of one of the hotels. During\r\nthe course of the evening, a well-dressed man, who seemed to be serving\r\nin some capacity in the hotel, took him by the arm to one side, and\r\nasked him if he ever lived up on the toll-road a few miles above\r\nPlacerville. The parson replied that he did, and that his residence was\r\nin a cañon near the road, where he was at present mining. The man then\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n“You were a minister some four or five years ago, were you not?”\r\n\r\n“Why, no, I wern’t at all; they only called me parson because I looked\r\nso much like one. But say, stranger, why do you ask me these questions?”\r\n\r\n“Well, because when that road agent demanded your money, you remember\r\nyou said you were a preacher, and got right down in the dust to pray.”\r\n\r\n“Yaas, I know that; but you see that chap got the drop on me, and as I\r\nhad no weapon with me I was bound to save about $250 that I had in my\r\npocket.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” says the man, “and you did it well, too.”\r\n\r\n“Why,” Yank asks.\r\n\r\n“Why? because I was the chap who was concerned in that little funny\r\nbusiness.”\r\n\r\n“The h--l you was! why, you don’t say so! really though?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sure. You see I was on the way home from the other side and was\r\ndead broke, and I just thought to myself, now here is a good chance.\r\nIt was my first and last trial in the business, for the idea of\r\nrobbing a country preacher broke me all up. Do you notice that I am now\r\nbald-headed?”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes,” answered the parson; “what’s the matter?”\r\n\r\nThe man replied. “I was so disgusted with myself that I shed my hair\r\nall out on the way home.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll be doll garned!” exclaimed the parson. “Let’s go and take\r\nsuthin’.”\r\n\r\nAnd, by the way, this reminds me of another incident of a similar\r\nnature, where the principal actor could not resist good chance.\r\n\r\nThe robberies or attempts to rob became so frequent within a few miles\r\nof town, that it was very evident that the men engaged in the business\r\nwere a part of the sporting class, with which the town at this time\r\nwas filled. They would go up the road, leaving town late at night, and\r\nreturn before daylight. Many were suspected, but for want of evidence\r\nthey could not be arrested. The sheriff, equal to the emergency,\r\nemployed a man who had himself been in that business in some other\r\nquarter of the globe but who had reformed, to act as a spy or stool\r\npigeon; to go out upon the road at night and endeavor to recognize some\r\nof these sporting chaps.\r\n\r\nOn the day following, an old gentleman complained at the sheriff’s\r\noffice of having been stopped upon the road and robbed of quite a sum\r\nof money, and remarked that he believed that he could recognize the\r\nchap if he could see him, as it was not a very dark night. Just at this\r\nmoment our stool pigeon, or highway detective, entered the door. The\r\nold gentleman took a good, square look at him, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“There! There! That’s the chap who robbed me!”\r\n\r\nThe sheriff said to him:\r\n\r\n“Tom, did you rob this man?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” he replied, “and here is the money,” at the same time\r\nthrowing the purse upon the table.\r\n\r\nWhen asked why he did it he replied,\r\n\r\n“Well, it was such a good chance that I really couldn’t help it.”\r\n\r\nThe murder and robbery of Capt. Harmon of Smith’s Flat, a mining camp a\r\nfew miles above Placerville, is worth mentioning, for there is one very\r\nmysterious circumstance in connection with this man which is difficult\r\nof explanation.\r\n\r\nThe captain had been a seafaring man for many years, and, having become\r\ntired of the sea, he came up to this mining camp in the spring of\r\n’57 and opened a small store. It was noticed by many, in fact it was\r\nwell known among all who had made his acquaintance, that he was almost\r\ndaily in the habit of seating himself in the back part of his store and\r\nholding a conversation, as he very earnestly maintained, with his wife\r\nwho had been dead about seventeen years, and with a daughter also who\r\nhad been dead but a few years.\r\n\r\nIt was useless to argue or to reason with him in relation to the\r\nmatter, for he maintained most positively that such was really the\r\ncase, and they often conversed upon their family affairs and of events\r\nwhich had occurred in early life. It was the general opinion among all\r\nthat the captain was of course insane upon that subject, and for this\r\nreason but little was ever said about it. Spiritualism, at this early\r\nday, at least in this part of the country, had not yet been invented,\r\nalthough at the East it was being developed gradually, having at this\r\ndate progressed as far as table-tipping and other similar phenomena.\r\nFor this reason, when the captain maintained that he was conversing\r\nwith the spirits of his wife and daughter, it could not be accepted.\r\n\r\nIf I am not mistaken, I think that he had been in the camp about\r\neighteen months, when, one day, he made known to a number of his\r\ncustomers that he had been informed the day before by his wife that\r\nhe was soon to leave all earthly affairs and live with his family in\r\nthe other world. He said that his wife did not inform him just when\r\nhe should die, or by what means, and she had refused to enlighten him\r\nany further, only insisting that he would soon be with them. The news\r\nseemed to make him feel rather down-hearted; not, as he said, from\r\na knowledge of the fact of his going, but the means which would be\r\nused to take his life. He had no enemies that he knew of, and was,\r\nfurthermore, in very good health. The boys tried to laugh him out of\r\nthe thought of such a thing, but it was of no use. He received the\r\nnews from his wife upon a Sunday, and on the morning of the Thursday\r\nfollowing he was found upon his bed dead, having been killed with an\r\naxe by a Mexican. The safe was broken open and robbed also. The axe was\r\nsoon found in a shaft, and the Mexican who owned it was arrested, tried\r\nand executed.\r\n\r\nAnother instance in which two courageous and bright specimens of young\r\nAmerica took a very active part, occurred in Eldorado County, some time\r\nduring the year ’63.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUNTING JAIL BIRDS.]\r\n\r\nThese two boys, about 12 years of age, with their shot guns started\r\nout one pleasant morning on a hunt, and in passing the cabin of a\r\nminer, they saw coming from it a strange, suspicious looking character,\r\nwho was loaded down with plunder. Being satisfied that the man was a\r\nthief, they ordered him to return the goods to the cabin, which he\r\ndid. With their guns in readiness, they then ordered him to walk in\r\nthe trail ahead of them, and in this manner they marched the fellow\r\ninto Placerville, a distance of nearly three miles, into the hospitable\r\narms of Sheriff Rogers, who gave him a very cordial reception. Upon\r\ninvestigation, he proved to be an ex-convict, and a very dangerous man,\r\nbut unfortunately for him and very fortunately for the boys, too, at\r\nthis time he was unarmed.\r\n\r\nOn the way to town, he tried every means to prevail upon the boys to\r\nlay down their guns. He offered to bet them five dollars that they\r\ncould not kill a bird perched upon a bush near the trail. One of the\r\nboys remarked that “Them wasn’t the kind of birds we’re huntin’ for;\r\nwe’re huntin’ only for jail birds.” He promised them in case they would\r\njust lay their guns down in the grass for a minute or so, he would give\r\neach of ’em a great many shares of stock in one of the richest mines in\r\nthe Comstock.\r\n\r\nThey politely informed him that the only kind of stock they cared about\r\njust then was gun stock, and that they had shares enough of that to go\r\nround.\r\n\r\nOne of the most laughable cases of highway robbery occurred a few years\r\nlater in Sonoma County, the agent in the affair being a youth about\r\nfourteen years of age. Commencing in fun, he unfortunately ended his\r\njoke in dead earnest.\r\n\r\nThis young man was walking out upon the road one evening, and hearing\r\nthe stage coming behind him, in order to avoid being run over, climbed\r\nupon the bank alongside of the road. The latter was very narrow and\r\nsandy at this point, and the horses were walking.\r\n\r\nNow, near to the edge of the bank where the boy was standing was a\r\npicket fence, and to keep from falling he was obliged to hug rather\r\nclosely to it. In doing so one of the pickets became loose, just as the\r\nstage had got opposite to him. In a spirit of fun, without calculating\r\nupon the effect of the movement, he pointed his loose picket toward the\r\ndriver of the stage, and in a coarse professional tone demanded him to\r\nstop; and, to his astonishment, the driver stopped the team. To carry\r\nout the joke, he then ordered the driver to throw out Wells & Fargo’s\r\ntreasure box; and he was again astonished to see the order promptly\r\nobeyed and the treasure box fall near him upon the bank. It now became\r\nnecessary, in order to continue the joke to a favorable termination, to\r\ngive one more peremptory order, and to hesitate was to be lost. So he\r\ncommanded the driver to “Go on!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PICKET GUARD.]\r\n\r\nThe stage with its load of passengers started onward, leaving the\r\ntreasure in care of the picket guard. Now came the crisis in the\r\naffair; the last act in the drama which was to determine the future\r\ndestiny of a bright specimen of Young America.\r\n\r\nThe boy seated himself upon the box and rubbed his eyes and scratched\r\nhis head to satisfy himself ’twas not all a dream. He said to himself:\r\n\r\n“Now here is an opportunity come to me that I never dreamed or thought\r\nof before. Is it my destiny? Now shall I be a good little boy, take\r\nback the box and tell ’em that I only done it for fun, or shall I keep\r\non jest as them bank cashiers and other fellers do sometimes, and make\r\nthe most of such opportunities that come without huntin’ for um?”\r\n\r\nHe concluded that if it was only done for a joke, he had carried it a\r\nlittle too far, but if it was done in dead earnest, he hadn’t quite\r\nfinished the job. While thus meditating between the two opposite\r\ncourses and upon the future possibilities, he finally decided that\r\nhe would finish the job, and adopt the profession of a road agent,\r\nconscious of the ability to make it a complete success, and even rival\r\nBlack Bart himself in the profession of a stage inspector. He also\r\nthought how he could jest make Jime Hume hump himself a-trying to\r\nfollow his trail.\r\n\r\nThe boy was, perhaps, justified in this conclusion by what he had\r\naccomplished with the aid of a single picket, and therefore judged\r\nof what he might be able to do if backed by an entire fence. With\r\nsuch thoughts running through his mind, and which, no doubt, he had\r\nacquired from the perusal of certain papers published exclusively for\r\nthe benefit of such boys, giving very graphic accounts of the exploits\r\nof “Three-Fingered Jack,” “The Bandit’s Bride,” as well as others of\r\na similar character, and with such bright visions of future notoriety\r\nlooming up before him, he wrestled with the treasure box for a few\r\nminutes, the latter soon looking as though it had been chasing a\r\ncyclone, and had caught it. By means of a big rock he had turned the\r\nbox wrong side out, and the golden coin was scattered about among the\r\ngrass, glistening in the starlight. But unfortunately for our infant\r\nhero his career was short, and for the same reasons, perhaps, that\r\nother great enterprises often end in failure; he had engaged in a\r\nprofession that he had not the capacity, experience, or the necessary\r\nqualities to fill, and it therefore ended by his being locked up.\r\n\r\nIt was about the year ’66 that an Irishman drove ahead of him into\r\nthe town of Placerville a road agent, whom he had captured out on the\r\ntoll-road a few miles above.\r\n\r\nWhen asked by Mr. Griffith, the sheriff, how he had managed to capture\r\nsuch a man, who, by the way, was much the larger as well as the younger\r\nof the two, Pat replied:\r\n\r\n“Indade, thin, I was jist a thraveling along the road alone by meself,\r\ndo yez moind; attinding to me own business and havin’ no thought of\r\nharum at all, whin, all to onct, this dirthy spallpeen came out from\r\nbehoind a bush, and, pinting his gun at me hid, says to me, ‘An’ will\r\nyez plase be afther handing me ther kine that yez are carryin’ about\r\nwith yez, and be hasty about it, too, or darmed if Oi don’t blow the\r\nhid off av yez.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “GO AN’ SAY ME AGENT.”]\r\n\r\n“Says Oi: ‘Yez will, thin?’ Says he: ‘Indeed thin Oi will.’ ‘But\r\nhold aisy, now,’ says Oi, ‘divil a bit will yez do that same,’ and I\r\ncomminced to fale about in me pockets to say if Oi cud sthrike some\r\nkine, but divil a bit cud Oi sthrike ther color of it at all at all.\r\nAn’ so says Oi: ‘Bad luck to it, thin, but Oi have left me purse with\r\nme agent in town.’ ‘An’ who’s yer agent in town,’ says he. ‘Indade,\r\nthin, would yez loike to make his acquaintance?’ says Oi. ‘Oi would,’\r\nsays he. ‘An’ yez shall, thin,’ says Oi.

All residents, with but few exceptions, are now well pleased\r\nwith their adopted home, and intend to remain and grow up with the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nBut how about the pioneers at this time? They were very numerous\r\nthroughout this portion of the mining region. In December, ’59, they\r\nnumbered in this county at least 25,000, a small portion of them only,\r\nhowever, engaged in mining. And now, at the expiration only ten years,\r\nI find upon investigation that there are not to exceed 600 in the\r\ncounty remaining. A few are yet engaged in mining; many have left for\r\ntheir Eastern homes, and some have crossed to the other side, while\r\nmany have fenced in tracts of land and are engaged in fruit raising.\r\nBut the great majority have scattered throughout the length and breadth\r\nof the Pacific Slope, some to engage in agriculture or in stock raising\r\nin the valleys below, and others entering into business of various\r\nkinds in the Cities of San Francisco and Sacramento.\r\n\r\nWith the discovery of the silver mines in Nevada there ensues another\r\nvery important event: The overland stage, a boon to old-timers, for\r\nthey can now communicate with their friends in the East much quicker\r\nand oftener than by water, is established, and which again in its\r\nturn, as a means of rapid communication with the East, is superseded\r\nby the pony express. The first arrival of the pony express occurred, I\r\nthink, in the fall of ’59. The wild mustang was ridden by Harry Rolf,\r\nnow a resident of Oakland, and he came flying through the city of\r\nPlacerville, on his way to Sacramento City, amid the waving of flags,\r\nthe firing of guns, and the hurrah of the multitude which lined the\r\nsides of the road to witness the important event. But although we were\r\noccupying a new and as yet an unsettled portion of the earth which we\r\nhad only recently occupied, yet the progressive spirit of the age, for\r\nwhich our nation is noted, was not wanting, for in a very short time\r\nthese primitive means of transit and of communication with the East\r\nwere again in their turn thrust aside and superseded by the iron horse\r\nand the telegraph. Soon came, also, the sound of war and strife between\r\nthe North and the South, and now the very important question which had\r\nagitated the country for nearly a century was to be decided for all\r\ntime, viz., should the whole country be for freedom or for slavery?\r\nThere were many throughout the State who believed the latter to be\r\npossible, but the sentiment was almost universal that we in California\r\nwould prevent, by all possible means, any attempt upon the part of\r\neither side to involve the residents of the State in the conflict, and\r\nall such attempts, therefore, were very effectually suppressed and\r\npeace and quietness reigned throughout the State. There was, however, a\r\nstage robbery which occurred upon the Virginia City road, a few miles\r\nabove Placerville. A large amount of silver bullion was stolen, and in\r\neffecting the capture of the robbers one of the officers was killed,\r\nhis name being T. G. Caples. In their defense the robbers claimed\r\nthat they were commissioned officers, acting under orders from their\r\ncommanders of the Confederate Government; they were, consequently, not\r\noutlaws or robbers, and demanded the rights and usages due to prisoners\r\nof war. But unfortunately for them our judges did not take that view of\r\nthe case, and they were found guilty of highway robbery. One of them\r\n(Poole) was found guilty also of murder and executed in Placerville in\r\nthe fall of ’63, if I am not mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe winter of ’61-’62 was a very wet one, and water therefore was\r\nabundant throughout the mining regions, enabling the miners to work and\r\nground-sluice many good paying claims located above the ditches which\r\nfurnished the water for mining purposes below. Sacramento felt the\r\neffects of this unusually rainy winter, for twice during the season was\r\nthe city flooded, causing great damage and loss.\r\n\r\nA little incident resulting upon this flood in Sacramento is perhaps\r\nworth relating, as it illustrates not only the uncertainty of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM THE FRYING PAN INTO THE FIRE.]\r\n\r\nthings generally, but also that each and every locality is subject in\r\nits own way to certain events peculiar to the surrounding conditions.\r\n\r\nA certain emigrant from the Fatherland, who lost all his earthly\r\npossessions during the flood in Sacramento City, came to the conclusion\r\nthat he would in future make his dwelling place in some more elevated\r\nlocality, above the reach of the raging floods and at high water mark.\r\nHe therefore, in the fall of ’63, in accordance with this desire,\r\nbought an old station or wayside hotel, located in the toll road a\r\nfew miles above Placerville. During the succeeding winter, our German\r\nfriend, with his family and a few others, were sitting around the big\r\nstove one afternoon. It was storming heavily outside, and the landlord\r\nwas congratulating himself upon the fact that he was far above all\r\ndanger from the floods and earthquakes below, and that he had found at\r\nlast a safe home for his family. Just at this moment his wife jumped\r\nfrom her chair, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Mine Gott! vat vas dat noise I hear?”\r\n\r\nThey all jumped to their feet, and none too soon, for at this instant,\r\nthe rear end of the room in which they were sitting fell in with a\r\ncrash, and a huge boulder went crashing through the house, taking in\r\nits flight the stove, and, smashing through the front of the building\r\ninto the road, rolled away into the creek, some seventy-five yards\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nTo say that our German friend and the rest of them were astonished,\r\nor astounded would hardly express it, for they were simply paralyzed.\r\nAfter recovering his senses, he exclaimed, in the most solemn accents:\r\n\r\n“Ach mine Gott! mine Gott! How vas dot den? Oh! mine grashus, vere ve\r\ngo next! I vas most drowned out mit dose vaters in Sagramento, vas\r\nshaked all to bieces by dem earthquakes at San Francisco, und den I vas\r\ngone up here, vare dem earthquakes or dem waters do not come at all,\r\nvid mine family, und, but up here, mine grashus, dem mountains shust\r\ncome right through mine house und smash dem all to bieces. Mine Gott,\r\nvare ve goes now to py oursellufs?”\r\n\r\nHis wife suggested that they had better go to San Francisco.\r\n\r\n“Oh, mine grashus, no no. Dem earthquakes down dere vill shust shakes\r\nmine head off righd avay, und gife mine families the shakes all ofer.\r\nNo I tink ve vill go pack to Shairmany, for we can find no blace to\r\nlife here in dot strange country. By von blace you vas shake all to\r\nbieces by dem earthquake; den you go to anudder blace, und der vater\r\ncome und vash you all avay; den you vas find anudder blace, vare you\r\ndon’t see dem shakes or dem vaters, und den, py shiminy, dem hills is\r\nall loose, und dey shust dumble down right ofer on to mine house. I\r\ngoes to Shairmany, mine frent, pooty quick; now don’t it?”\r\n\r\nAn event was now about to take place which was to change to a great\r\nextent the future condition of our new home upon the Pacific Coast.\r\nFor although all were apparently content and well satisfied with our\r\nrelative position, yet there was a certain feeling of disconnection,\r\nan impassable barrier between us and our old homesteads with the\r\npleasing associations connected with them; there were between us high\r\nand lofty ranges of rugged mountains and barren plains that to many\r\nwere absolutely impassable, while yet by water the voyage to visit\r\nfriends and our Eastern friends was a long and tedious one; under such\r\ncircumstances it was evident that something yet was wanting which would\r\nenable us to enjoy to the fullest extent the favorable conditions\r\nafforded by a residence here in California, and this something which\r\nall felt the necessity of was a rapid means of communication with our\r\nformer Eastern homes. The great event, therefore, to which I alluded\r\nwas the commencement, by a few energetic old-timers, of a railroad\r\nacross the mountains. In early days the possibility of a railroad\r\nacross the continent was often talked of among the miners, and those\r\nwho had traveled and prospected among the deep cañons and rugged cliffs\r\nof the mountains were very strongly impressed with the conviction that\r\nthe building of a railroad across and over them would be a physical\r\nimpossibility; consequently, when all preparations were made for the\r\npurpose, it was the general opinion among them that it was the wild\r\nfancy of a few lunatics who were ignorant of railroads in general,\r\nor what natural barriers and obstacles were to be encountered in the\r\nbuilding of this railroad in particular. Notwithstanding the protest\r\nand prophetic warnings of the old mountaineers, the work was formally\r\ncommenced in Sacramento City in ’63, and the last (golden) spike driven\r\nin ’68, which formed the connecting link between the two roads, making\r\na continuous line between the Atlantic and the Pacific Coasts. The\r\neffect of this connection was at once apparent, for we now felt as\r\nthough we formed a part of the nation and under its protection; but\r\nwhether the iron rails had any effect upon the electric conditions of\r\nthe country (as was maintained by certain ones), causing atmospheric\r\nchanges here, is immaterial; at any rate, social conditions, which\r\nheretofore had been unbalanced, were now properly adjusted, for,\r\ninstead of dwelling away off in some remote corner of the universe, in\r\na foreign land, as we imagined, separated entirely from intercourse\r\nwith higher conditions of existence by mountain ranges and barren\r\ndeserts, the iron rails had now broken down the barriers, and from this\r\npoint in our history we felt more at home. But what said the old miners\r\nwho had predicted all sorts of troubles, disasters, and failure of the\r\nlunatics, the originators of the undertaking, after its successful\r\ncompletion? “Well” (as one of them expressed himself--an Englishman),\r\n“give a company of Americans the right of way and a subsidy, and blast\r\nme yies if they wouldn’t run a tunnel through the earth and build a\r\nrailroad to China, yer know.”\r\n\r\nAn observation of Nature’s works shows us that the wise Creator,\r\nin scattering upon the surface of our planet his treasures in the\r\nform of gems and rich mineral ores, decided it best to give to such\r\nportions of the surface as were the most barren and desolate, the most\r\nrugged and mountainous, as well as the least attractive and unfit for\r\ncultivation or civilization, the greatest amount of treasures in the\r\nform of precious stones or valuable mineral ores as some compensation\r\nfor such defects, and an investigation of the earth’s surface shows\r\nus that this is almost universally the case. But in the case of\r\nCalifornia however, for some wise purpose, he saw fit to make one grand\r\nexception; for although containing, as it does, some of the richest\r\nmines in the world, yet it contains also some of the richest and most\r\nvaluable farming lands, the low, red hills in the mining regions, the\r\nbest adapted for the cultivation of the vine and all other varieties\r\nof fruit. It contains, also, the largest trees, as well as the highest\r\nwaterfall in the world, the grandest scenery and the finest climate,\r\nas well as many other advantages possessed by no other country. The\r\neffects of this railroad connection with the East was to enable\r\nthousands to make their homes here in this favored country, or to\r\ntravel through it for observation, with a design at some future time\r\nof again returning to dwell amidst the orange groves, and to breathe\r\nthe pure air of this favored country, and, furthermore, to enable many\r\nof the old pioneers, who had abandoned all hopes of ever being able to\r\nvisit the familiar scenes of their early days, to once more journey\r\ntowards the rising sun; to visit their early homes in the East without\r\nfear of Indians, or starvation upon the desert plains, or of shipwreck\r\nupon the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n THE FORTY-NINER--SYD AT THE NORTH POLE--THE HOMES OF THE\r\n OLD-TIMERS--THE REMAINS OF THE CABINS OF THE FORTY-NINERS--PANNING OUT\r\n THE OLD CABINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all mining excitements which have occurred upon the coast when new\r\ndiscoveries have been made, the forty-niner was as a general rule the\r\nfirst to be afflicted with the fever, and they would invariably be\r\nfound in advance, leading their friends to victory or to ruin.\r\n\r\nGreat numbers caught the fever and stampeded during the Frazier River\r\nexcitement, as well as of the Salmon River, Gold Bluff, Caribo, Alder\r\nGulch and other occasions, but returned again from their useless\r\nsearch for new fields, not in despair, however, but only to make good\r\npreparations for the next occasion that should offer in some other\r\nsection of the country. Many are at present trying their fortunes\r\nin Montana and among the rugged cliffs of the Coeur d’Alene silver\r\nregions, in the hope of yet being able to strike at least a paying mine\r\nof some kind, if it is nothing more than pewter, sheet-iron, soap,\r\npaint or putty, at any rate a paying mine, which will enable them to\r\ndo once more, before they depart for that happy land where prospecting\r\nis an unnecessary business, a full suit of store clothes and a biled\r\nshirt, including the usual accompaniments known to civilized society.\r\nIt is this incentive that gives energy to the old forty-niner, that\r\ngives strength and elasticity to his limbs, and which enables him to\r\nwander forth through deep and rocky cañons; to climb the steep and\r\nrugged cliffs of the mountain ranges, in many cases where younger\r\nprospectors are unable to follow, to discover if possible, some\r\nlocation where he can get several colors to pan, and find the bed rock\r\npitching. But the old-timer, however, desires something more than this;\r\nfor it is not altogether the discovery of a fair prospect, and with\r\nthe bed rock pitching, that he wants. Not at all. But as Old Syd the\r\nBadger, as he was titled, remarked after his return from one of his\r\nexcursions away north, at the time of the Frazier River excitement:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SYD’S LAST PROSPECT.]\r\n\r\n“Oh, yaas! Thar is gold along up thar, but dogearn it, a feller can’t\r\ngo nowhar to prospect now, but that he will find that some sneaking\r\ntender-foot has been thar a little ahead of him; darned if I don’t\r\nhunt for some spot to prospect whar no miner’s pick was ever struck\r\nyet.”\r\n\r\nWhen it was suggested to him that there was but one spot where no\r\nminer has ever prospected yet, and that that was at the North Pole,\r\nhe remarked that he’d be dogearned if he didn’t go thar, then, and\r\nit was afterwards supposed that he did, for, some years afterwards,\r\nsome miners upon the Yukon saw the apparition of an old veteran miner\r\npacking upon his back an immense roll of blankets, cooking utensils and\r\nmining tools, going in the direction of the Pole, and at a distance,\r\nthe apparition, when seen through the fog, resembled in appearance\r\nto a native the huge form of a mastodon wandering in the forests. We\r\nhave therefore every reason to believe that the first expedition which\r\nsucceeds in reaching the Pole will find the remains of Old Syd, the\r\nForty-niner, seated comfortably upon the top of the Pole upon which he\r\nhas put his mining notice, and with his glass carefully examining a\r\npiece of it which he has broken off, to see if it contains mineral. The\r\nidea seems almost universal among the residents of the State, and in\r\nfact the coast, that the remnants of the Advance Guard of gold seekers,\r\nthe Forty-niners, are at present the poorest class of men of any upon\r\nthe coast; but this is a mistaken idea, for an investigation as to\r\nthe facts of the case show conclusively that many of our wealthiest\r\nmen were Forty-niners, although the great majority of them are now\r\npoor. That they were energetic and restless, as well as adventurous\r\nis evident, for it was the possession of these traits which made them\r\nForty-niners; for without them, they would certainly have waited for\r\nothers to take the lead. It is for these reasons that we now find\r\nthem roaming around upon various portions of the coast for new mines,\r\nnot that they care so much for the wealth buried there, but this\r\nrestless spirit of adventure to find wealth is from force of habit,\r\nthat others who follow them may enjoy the full benefit of it. And for\r\nthese adventures they were always ready, and at the first alarm when\r\nthere was wafted through the mining regions a bare suspicion that new\r\ndiggings had been found somewhere, the blankets were bound up at once\r\nwith all the necessary paraphernalia, ready at a moment’s notice; and\r\nin some cases, they (the blankets) had been so accustomed to be bound\r\nup, that (like the chickens of the man who was constantly moving with\r\nhis family from place to place, whenever they saw the old familiar\r\nwagon at the door, would invariably lie down and cross their legs to\r\nbe tied), upon the first appearance of any unusual noise or confusion,\r\nthey would immediately roll up, the rope would wiggle and twist itself\r\ninto a knot around them, and the old coffee-pot, the fry-pan, as well\r\nas the pick, pan and shovel from beneath the bunk, would all begin to\r\ncrawl towards their accustomed place upon the top of the blankets,\r\nready to be tied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORCE OF HABIT.]\r\n\r\nIt is remarked throughout the mining regions that these ancient relics\r\nof a former period are a tough and a hardy race, healthy and vigorous,\r\nand are capable of standing as much fatigue and severe labor as the\r\ngreat majority of younger men; the reasons for this, of course, are\r\nthat those who remain of that great multitude who first arrived here,\r\ntook better care of themselves, as a rule; for if they had not, they\r\nwould not now be here. This fact, therefore, is a fair illustration of\r\nthe truth of the Darwinian theory of the survival of the fittest.\r\n\r\nTo an old-timer of this day, it is pleasant to wander amid the old\r\nscenes where we mined so many long years ago with the pan and cradle.\r\nThe ravines and gulches have somewhat changed, it is true; for we find\r\nwhere once the ground was clear and free from trees is now a dense\r\nforest of thrifty pines. Yet the old localities have a familiar look,\r\nand sitting upon a large boulder, which we well remember working around\r\nand of panning from beneath it quite a respectable amount of gold,\r\nwe can almost in imagination go back in time to work over again the\r\nevents and scenes as they occurred in the past. In traveling among the\r\nravines and cañons at this late day in some portions of the mining\r\nregions, the rambler will occasionally come across a log cabin hidden\r\nin some recess, or upon the side of the hills among the forest trees,\r\nand occupied by an old-timer. They once lived in camp or nearer to\r\nthe town, but such changes in course of time occurred--the old-timers\r\nhaving scattered, whilst their places were occupied by strangers--that\r\nin a few years those old-timers who remained, and who still continued\r\nto linger around their old familiar haunts, were now in consequence\r\nof these changes dwelling among strangers. This was disagreeable,\r\nand could not be thought of. They therefore made their homes in\r\nthese out-of-way places, and seldom visit the towns or villages, but\r\nhermit-like pass their time in company with their favorite cat or dog.\r\n\r\nBut a short time since, an old-timer having occasion to visit the\r\nmining region, traveled through a section of the country where he mined\r\nin early days, but which is now a lonely and desolate region. He was\r\ntherefore greatly astonished to find two log cabins which were occupied\r\nin this deserted region; but he was much more surprised to find that\r\nthe occupants of both of them were old-timers with whom he had been\r\nacquainted many long years before, and both were supposed to be dead.\r\nThey seem to enjoy life. They cultivate small gardens, and by the use\r\nof a cradle, are enabled to find gold enough to furnish them with all\r\nthe necessaries of life, which, as one of them stated, consisted of\r\none part flour, two parts potatoes, two of bacon, and the balance in\r\nwhiskey, as far as their claim would stand it; which meant of course\r\nabout ninety-five parts of whiskey, with occasionally a dish of beans\r\nfor variety.\r\n\r\nIt was with the greatest pleasure that I wandered a few years ago\r\namong the old ravines, across the flats, and through the cañons where\r\nwe used to mine, and to visit the old cabins or the places where they\r\nused to stand, for the greater portion of them have gone to decay; but\r\nthere upon that point under the big oak tree you can yet see a few\r\ndecayed logs, all that now remains of a large cabin once occupied by\r\na company of boys from Philadelphia, who came around Cape Horn in the\r\ngood ship “Susan G. Owens;” while over there upon that bench above are\r\nthe remains of a cabin that was occupied in the fall of ’49 by a French\r\nCount. He never spoke to anyone; neither did I ever see him smile; but\r\nhe worked hard in the ravine below and was always dressed in real Paris\r\nstyle with plug hat, black dress coat buttoned up to his chin, and\r\nwearing upon his feet a pair of cloth gaiters.\r\n\r\nAround upon that flat yonder, by the spring, you can still see the\r\noutlines of a miner’s cabin. The lower part of the chimney is yet\r\nstanding, and that great flat stone was the door step. That cabin was\r\noccupied in ’49 by a company of young men from Providence, R. I., who\r\ncame around the Horn in the bark “Floyd.”\r\n\r\nThere at the foot of the hill, you can now see the remains of an old\r\ncabin built by some boys from New York City; while a little further\r\ndown you can see the remains of an old chimney which was built of\r\nflat stones. This was occupied by the Russell, Chase and Gibbs boys,\r\na delegation from Nantucket. Crossing the creek, and going up that\r\nravine, you will see the remains of numerous cabins; the first one\r\nperched upon that bluff above was occupied by a few boys from Maine;\r\nanother one further up, was the home of a company from Massachusetts.\r\nThe latter came through the Straits of Magellan in a small schooner\r\nnamed the “Emily Bourne,” and the Captain was taken prisoner by the\r\nIndians at Patagonia, but finally escaped. The sites formerly occupied\r\nby the cabins of the old Forty-niners are undergoing great changes, for\r\nthe grounds where many of them once stood are now being covered with\r\nfruit trees and vineyards.\r\n\r\nUp on that rocky point now covered with grape vines was the site of a\r\ncabin occupied by Tompkins and three others, who were passengers in\r\nthe ship “Areatas” from Boston. Just below them was located a cabin\r\noccupied by Rowland, Hayden and Moore, passengers in the schooner “John\r\nAlyne,” from Massachusetts. A walk up Oregon Ravine would bring to\r\nview upon the flat to the right, and upon the side hill beyond, the\r\nremains of numerous castles, built and occupied by the Forty-niners.\r\nOne in particular, at the time of my visit among them, was yet\r\nstanding; and for nearly twenty years this ancient edifice, erected\r\nat a great sacrifice of mental energy, and occupied by the writer and\r\nthree others, passengers of the ship “America,” was desecrated to fowl\r\npurposes, being used for a hen roost.\r\n\r\nDown there, below the spring near the creek, you can yet see the\r\nremains of an old chimney and a level spot, where in ’49 stood a\r\ncabin in which were domiciled three or four passengers who came from\r\nPanama in the good ship “Niantic,” the old hull of which is now lying\r\nbeneath a large building at the corner of Clay and Sansome streets,\r\nSan Francisco. A little further down on that gravel bench stood the\r\ncabin of a few of the boys who came out in the bark “Diamond,” the old\r\nhull of which was moored to the levee in Sacramento City for more than\r\ntwenty years subsequently and used for a storehouse.\r\n\r\nIf you would follow that trail for a short distance up the ravine, you\r\nwould see the remains of the chimneys, and a few old, decayed logs, all\r\nthat now remain of two cabins, one sheltering a few young men from the\r\nState of Kentucky, the occupants of the other hailing from Indiana, and\r\nall of them fought under Taylor in the Mexican War. They came across\r\nthe plains, arriving in Hangtown in September, ’49.\r\n\r\nYou see yonder, on that rocky point among the trees, the few decayed\r\nlogs of an old cabin. You observe also that a portion of the old\r\nchimney is yet standing, for ’twas built of rocks, through which the\r\nnimble flap-jack often flew, to be caught again at the door. This cabin\r\nwas occupied by a number of Boston boys who came around the Horn in ’49\r\nin the staunch ship “Capital.”\r\n\r\nA walk up through that cañon beyond will show you also the ruins of\r\nmany pleasant homes, but in many cases only the sites which they\r\noccupied are visible. These were all occupied by gold seekers from the\r\nNew England States, who had come around the Horn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUINED CASTLES OF THE ’49ERS.]\r\n\r\nUpon that level spot to the right two men from Connecticut made\r\ntheir homes throughout the fall and winter of ’49-’50, with nothing\r\nto shelter them from the rain but an old wagon cover. They were\r\nindustrious, out at work early in the morning, and generally the last\r\nto quit work at night. During the time which they worked in the mines,\r\nwhich was a little less than a year, they never struck what was termed\r\na rich pay streak, but only what was termed an average paying claim or\r\nwages. Yet Scoville and Davenport, which were their names, took home\r\nwith them in the fall of ’50 something like $11,000 apiece, as the\r\nexpress agent afterwards stated, thus proving that industry, even in\r\nmining, is the main thing in luck.\r\n\r\nYou observe away up that ravine a level spot now covered with trees. If\r\nyou take the trouble to walk up that way, you would see a few old logs\r\nand the remains of an old chimney, being all that is left now of the\r\nonce pleasant home of two young men from the city of Baltimore. They\r\narrived here early in ’49, and found that ravine very rich. Starting\r\nfor their native city in November of the same year, they took with\r\nthem, as stated at the time, about $20,000 apiece, but in the course of\r\na few weeks they returned to the mines, wiser perhaps, but poorer men,\r\nhaving spent their money, as one of them explained, in the study of\r\nnatural history at one of the gorgeous and inviting gambling menageries\r\nin San Francisco. As I have before mentioned, they resided in that\r\ncabin for many years but finally left for other mines.\r\n\r\nJust over yonder, on that level spot at the foot of the hill, now the\r\nChinaman’s garden, was the cabin of Dr Wakefield with his wide-awake\r\nwife, hailing from the State of Connecticut, and she had the whole\r\nfield to herself in one respect, at least. She furnished the miners\r\nwith the regular, old-fashioned mince pies that they had been\r\naccustomed to eating in their Eastern homes, and at a price too which\r\nno one could cavil at, it being for pies plain $2 each, sugared upper\r\ncrust 50 cents extra. Whether it was owing to the healthy nature of the\r\npie material, or from the fact that the lady herself never ate any of\r\nher own pies, perhaps will never be known. At any rate, she is at the\r\npresent time in good health, and a resident of the city of Oakland.\r\n\r\nIn the lower part of Hangtown, and nearly opposite to where the foundry\r\nnow stands, was the cabin of John Cook, and his wife was the first\r\nwasherwoman in Hangtown.\r\n\r\nJust below them, on the bank of the creek, was the cabin of the two\r\nRussell brothers, from the city of New York, who returned home in\r\nDecember of ’49, taking with them about $12,000 each, which they took\r\nfrom Oregon Ravine.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the creek, upon the side of the hill, could\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FRISKY FLAPJACK.]\r\n\r\nbe seen for many years the remains of an old cabin that was built and\r\noccupied in September, ’49, by a company of pilgrims who came around\r\nCape Horn in the good ship “Mayflower” from New Bedford, Mass.\r\n\r\nUp there by the bank, on the opposite side of the creek, was the old\r\nlog cabin in which lived Uncle Ned Keegen, and he continued to occupy\r\nit for many years, at the present time living with his family on the\r\nsame spot.\r\n\r\nNearly opposite, on the flat, was a more pretentious residence: a\r\ncostly edifice, and an illustration of the expensive habits of the\r\nForty-niners, being constructed of shakes and pine poles. In this were\r\ndomiciled A. F. Bee, his brother F. A. Bee, C. C. Batterman and others,\r\nwho came around Cape Horn in the ship “Elizabeth Ellen,” from New York.\r\n\r\nDuring a walk down Weaver Creek, we saw the remains of the old building\r\nused by Darlington as a store in ’49, and upon the flats and points,\r\nas we passed along down the creek, we noticed the remains of numerous\r\nchimneys, which are the indications of the former existence of cabins\r\nthat were occupied by the Forty-niners; and a short distance below\r\nthe village of Weaverville a few years previously could be seen the\r\nold decayed logs and chimney of the cabin in which resided Mr. Frank\r\nPixley, now editor of the _Argonaut_, San Francisco, who engaged in\r\nmining on the creek. A short distance below, the remains of an old\r\nchimney were seen that belonged to a cabin which was occupied by three\r\nor four Nantucket boys, who came around Cape Horn in the good ship\r\n“Fanny.”\r\n\r\nIn following down the creek, the old decayed logs and ruins of ancient\r\nchimneys could be seen upon various points and flats that were used as\r\nhomes by the Forty-niners; while near Cold Springs, there upon the side\r\nhill, is plainly visible the remains of a cabin erected in ’49 by W.\r\nSalmon & Co.\r\n\r\nOver there upon that point, those old logs and fallen chimney is all\r\nthat is left of a store owned by Sturgess & Hill, which was the first\r\nstore, I believe, that was started at this camp.\r\n\r\nI might continue in describing the present appearances of the pleasant\r\nhomes of the Forty-niners, located among the ravines of the mining\r\nregion; but the reader in imagination can see scattered around about,\r\nupon every available spot, the ruins of what was once the pleasant\r\nabode of this now almost extinguished and forgotten race.\r\n\r\nBut what an interesting book that would be to the Forty-niner, if we\r\ncould read the history of each and every one of these old Forty-niners,\r\nthe former occupants of all these now decayed log cabins; to read\r\nof the success of a portion of them, as well as of the defeated\r\nexpectations of the greater number, and of the present condition, where\r\nliving, and of their final success or failure in life. And although\r\nno doubt such a history would show us that but a small proportion of\r\nthose old-timers who are now living have achieved success, or who are\r\nat least at present in the enjoyment of it, yet it cannot be doubted\r\nbut that the desire or wish would be unanimous to live over again the\r\nscenes and incidents of the past, and to experience once more the\r\nexciting pleasures and expectations found only among the mountains\r\nof the mining region. Oh, yes, one would answer; if we could only\r\nknow what we have since learned in relation to gold mining; but such\r\nknowledge would break the spell and utterly destroy all interest, since\r\nthe charm not only in seeking for gold, but in all other human affairs,\r\nconsists more in the anticipation than in the realization.\r\n\r\nThere is one fact in relation to all of these old cabins, which were\r\nbuilt and occupied by the Forty-niners, which may be of some interest\r\nto mention. In early mining days the conveniences for storing and\r\ntaking care of gold dust were very poor. It being plentiful, the\r\nminers were very careless in handling when engaged in drying and\r\ncleaning it, which was usually done upon an old shovel or an old pan.\r\nThe consequence was that much of the fine dust was scattered among\r\nthe ashes or around upon the floor. The small buckskin sacks, also,\r\nin which each one usually carried about with him for present use a\r\nquantity of fine dust, were of poor quality, and through the seams of\r\nthem fine dust would work its way out.\r\n\r\nThe discovery was made by some inquisitive prospector, in the spring\r\nof ’53, that the most of these ancient castles would pay to pan out,\r\nas well as the ash heaps in front of the door, and one enterprising\r\nprospector, previous to the fact being generally known, bought up\r\na number of them, from which he realized quite a sum. From one in\r\nparticular, that I remember, which was a large cabin and had been\r\noccupied by a number of miners who had rich claims, he realized the sum\r\nof $600 from the dirt scraped up from under the floor and the fire\r\nplace. These old cabins were hunted for among the various cañons and\r\nravines (for it must be remembered, as I have previously explained,\r\nthat this portion of the mining region around Hangtown, as well as\r\nColoma where the first mining was done, was worked out, and was almost\r\nentirely deserted by the spring of ’54), and they all paid well; the\r\namount cleaned from the floor and ash heap, as a general rule, giving\r\nsome indication of the success of their former occupants.\r\n\r\nMany of the old-timers, when starting out for the new discoveries in\r\nthe spring of ’50, not wishing to be encumbered with their gold, and\r\nfor fear also of losing it, would in such cases bury it somewhere\r\naround the old cabin beneath the floor or stones in the fireplace, or\r\nin some other locality, until they returned. Some of these hidden tin\r\ncans were afterwards found, and there is no doubt but that many of them\r\nare yet remaining securely hidden among the rocks, or beneath the roots\r\nof some large tree; for a portion of the miners never returned to the\r\nold mining camp, having died perhaps in some other part of the mining\r\nregion. In other instances as of those who did return, two or three\r\nyears afterwards, perhaps, they had forgotten where they had buried\r\ntheir gold, and searched for it in vain.\r\n\r\nI remember the case of one old miner in particular, who, previous to\r\nstarting out upon his prospecting expedition, took the greatest pains\r\nto bury his can, containing several thousand dollars worth of dust.\r\nAnd he did it in a very scientific manner: measuring so many yards due\r\nnorth from a certain stump; then so many yards due west; then so many\r\nto the right, and so many again to the left, etc., burying his can at\r\nthe last point of measurement. Of course he made a chart of all this in\r\ntrue surveyor’s style; but unfortunately for him he lost the chart, and\r\nthe old stump was gone also. So, after digging and prospecting around\r\nfor more than a year to find where that last point of measurement was,\r\nhe was finally compelled to give it up, and the can yet remains hidden\r\nonly a few feet below where that last little peg was stuck into the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n MEETING OF THE OLD-TIMERS--THE BUCKEYE TUNNEL--THE BEST AS IT\r\n IS--BOOZER WHO GOT SKUNKED--THE HYDRAULIC MINER--MIKE’S EXPLANATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo an old-timer who is socially inclined, and I believe this is a trait\r\nof character peculiar to the most of them, there is nothing, at least\r\nof a social nature, that can be more agreeable or pleasing to him than\r\nto meet with the old-timers with whom he was acquainted, or with an old\r\npard with whom he lived and worked nearly forty years ago.\r\n\r\nIt was upon a certain occasion, but a short time ago, when, having to\r\npass through an old mining locality, that I met by chance at a miner’s\r\ncabin in the now dreary and almost deserted mining camp a company of\r\nold miners, and among them found five old-timers whom I had known\r\nnearly forty years before in the mining regions, where they were\r\nengaged in mining.\r\n\r\nFor instance, here was old Mike, a rare specimen from the “old sod,”\r\nwho was one of our company when at work at Kanaka bar upon the South\r\nfork of the American River, in the winter of ’50-’51. He was a man\r\noverflowing with humor, of rare intelligence and generous to a fault.\r\n\r\nHere was Tennessee also, who was a fine specimen of manhood from the\r\nState which gave him his sobriquet, a man who was true to his friends\r\nand with few enemies, and they were careful to keep out of his way,\r\nalthough he was always ready to forgive an injury.\r\n\r\nAnother one was Jeff, who was a happy-go-lucky specimen of an\r\nold-timer, who delighted to tramp around among the deep cañons and high\r\nrocky cliffs for a prospect; not, however, that he expected to derive\r\nany benefit from the rich discoveries that he might make, but, as he\r\nexpressed it, it did just make him feel awful good to see his friends\r\nand relatives enjoy it.\r\n\r\nHere was Jim also, a character similar in many respects to Jeff, and\r\nwho like the latter had washed from the soil a respectable fortune but\r\nhad scattered it among his friends and relatives in the East, this\r\nmanner of using it affording him the greatest enjoyment.\r\n\r\nAnd last, though not least by any means, was Jersey. The latter\r\nin early mining days had been very fortunate in all his mining\r\nenterprises; had made and lost several fortunes in assisting others,\r\nand even now in his old age was confident that it was to be his good\r\nfortune to once more strike it rich in some far away and remote mining\r\nregion, for to his mental vision distance seemed to lend enchantment to\r\nthe view.\r\n\r\nThere were present old Pike and Boozer, who were yet in harness,\r\ntramping about among the various mountain ranges of the coast, wherever\r\nthe indications were in their opinion most favorable for another raise\r\nthat was to exceed all previous ones.\r\n\r\nHere also was Julius, a venerable colored individual from Boston,\r\nan old-timer, too, and who had, like Mike, and for similar reasons,\r\nabandoned mining, and was engaged in ranching.\r\n\r\nThe day after our meeting was a rainy one, and was spent in relating\r\nour experiences for the past forty years in the various mining sections\r\nof the coast; narrating our prospecting adventures among the various\r\nmountain ranges that we had climbed over, and the deep, dark cañons\r\nthrough which we had tramped in hopes of once more making a raise.\r\n\r\nIt was interesting to hear each one in his turn relate how near upon\r\ncertain occasions he came to striking it awfully rich, or what he might\r\nhave done if so and so had not occurred, or what he didn’t do and ought\r\nto have done, while another would explain how near he came to making\r\na big thing if he had only stuck to his claim a little longer, or had\r\nonly run his tunnel in a little farther.\r\n\r\nYet another would relate how he spent every dollar upon his claim by\r\nsticking to it a little too long, and found at last to his sorrow that\r\nit was of no value whatever.\r\n\r\nAnd this led to an argument upon the question as to how long a miner\r\nought to stick to his mine.\r\n\r\nMany instances were related to show how a great number missed it by\r\nabandoning a claim too soon, before bed rock had been struck in the\r\nshaft, or gravel in the tunnel; while other cases would be\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Yank.  Mike.  Jim.  Jeff.  Jersey.  Pike.  Tenn.  Julius.  Boozer.\r\n\r\nMEETING OF THE OLD-TIMERS.]\r\n\r\nmentioned of how miners had spent their last cent in prospecting a\r\nclaim that they ought to have quit long before, as all their friends\r\nadvised them to do.\r\n\r\nBut upon the whole it was the general opinion that owing to the nature\r\nof the business it was very uncertain and difficult to tell exactly\r\nwhen a miner should abandon his mine, for it was found that after all\r\nit was about an average, since just as many hit it by quitting a mine\r\nas others missed it by hanging on too long, and the number who hit it\r\nby sticking to it about equalled those who missed it by quitting too\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, decided that there was no rule to be governed by in\r\narriving at a conclusion, but that a miner must use his best judgment\r\nand trust to luck.\r\n\r\nOne miner related how it was that he missed making a fortune by running\r\nhis tunnel a little too “fur” to the right, and another who run his\r\ntunnel a “leetle too fur” to the left. A third, who worked a whole\r\nyear in running his tunnel into a hill where the rock was hard, and no\r\ngravel making its appearance, quit in despair, but soon after others\r\nwent in to work and running the tunnel but a few feet farther struck\r\nrich gravel.\r\n\r\nOne old-timer related that in ’53 he and five others worked about\r\nfourteen months in running a tunnel into a rich cement-capped hill,\r\nexpecting when they started to strike gravel at least in six or eight\r\nmonths. The storekeeper in town who was furnishing them with supplies\r\ntold them that he would be compelled to close down, for he had not\r\nthe means to continue furnishing them. They were in a bad fix, and a\r\nportion of the company were in favor of abandoning the mine at once,\r\nbut were finally persuaded to run one more week, and then if not\r\nthrough the bed rock to quit for good and all.\r\n\r\nAt noon upon the Saturday following they quit the mine where they had\r\nworked faithfully for more than fourteen months in the hardest kind of\r\nblue porphery, and concluded to try another hill near at hand, where\r\nthe prospects seemed more favorable.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon five of them donned their store clothes, went into\r\ntown and reported to the storekeeper the state of affairs, but promised\r\nto go to work immediately in the ravine and pay up their indebtedness\r\nas soon as possible. The old miner, continuing, said that “one young\r\nchap they called Sandy didn’t go into town with\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN UNEXPECTED FEAST.]\r\n\r\nus, but as soon as we had started for town he takes his tools and\r\ncandle and goes on a prospecting expedition in the tunnel which we had\r\nabandoned forever.”\r\n\r\nWhen we quit work at noon there was a large block of prophery overhead\r\nwhich seemed to be loose, but we didn’t think it worth while to remove\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSandy said afterwards that while eating his dinner he was thinking all\r\nthe time about that loose rock, and that we ought to have wedged it\r\nout, and that was just what he remained at home for. With the gads and\r\nsledge it soon fell from its place, and upon examination he discovered,\r\nto his astonishment, sand and gravel on its upper side. Upon holding\r\nup his candle he found that we had sure and sartin struck pay gravel.\r\nSandy tried a pan of it and found it rich beyond all expectation.\r\n\r\nUpon our return from town to the cabin at night we found the table all\r\nset in the very highest style of art, and bottles of champagne were\r\nincluded in the bill of fare. We thought Sandy had gone crazy sure in\r\nthinking perhaps of his great disappointment, but when asked for an\r\nexplanation he only pointed at our gold pan which we saw in the center\r\nof the table and resting upon the bottles of champagne. Upon looking\r\ninto the pan we saw several dollars’ worth of gold dust in the bottom\r\nof it, and when we asked him where it came from he pointed his finger\r\nin the direction of the tunnel, but we wouldn’t believe a word of it\r\nuntil we had all marched in, in single file, to the end of the tunnel\r\nand seen with our own eyes the rich gravel above.\r\n\r\nWell, we invited in the boys around, and you bet we just made the night\r\nhowl. The next day was Sunday and the folks around that camp were\r\nastonished to see the whole of the Buckeye Tunnel Company march into\r\nchurch dressed in their best for the first time since they had been in\r\nthe country. For you see we all felt kinder inclined that way after our\r\ngood fortune in striking pay gravel.\r\n\r\nAnd these illustrations led to a discussion by the old miners of the\r\nuncertainty of not only the mining industry, but of human affairs in\r\ngeneral, and old Mike remarked:\r\n\r\n“Yis, yis, me b’ys, so goes ther wuorld, for ’tis now yez do and now\r\nyez don’t. And again, jist as ye do ye don’t at all, at all, for ’tis\r\njist always afther being a leetle too fur to the right, or a leetle\r\ntoo fur to ther left, de yez see, with all of us. I tell ye, b’ys,\r\nthis mining business is afther being like all other kinds of business\r\njist; ’tis always jist a leetle ahead of us, de yez see, and jist at\r\nthat pint when yez are afther ixpecting it ther most, and jist as yez\r\nare commincing to faigure out where yez be afther goin, and what yez\r\nbe afther doin, and how yez’ll be afther spinding all your money, do\r\nyez moind, ’tis jist at this pint, me b’ys, ther bed rock kicks up and\r\nshlaps yez in ther face, and thin ther purr divil of a miner curses his\r\nluck, piles his blankets and tools upon his back and thramps around to\r\nfind another rich mine that’ll sarve him ther same thrick. But ye ould\r\nminers are always jist afther foinding ther spot thet’ll stick right by\r\nyez, where yez will some day be afther makin yer pile, and ’tis these\r\nixpectations thet kapes yez agoin’, thrampin around among ther hills,\r\nall over ther country, hunting for that same, but ’tis always jist a\r\nleetle ahead of yez, jist as ’tis in all other kinds of business in\r\nthis wuorld. And, be jabers, ’tis moity few of them who are ever afther\r\ncatchin up with it at all, at all, do yez moind thin.”\r\n\r\n“Yes Mike”, Yank remarked, “all human affairs are mighty uncertain, and\r\nfew of us meet with what we expect; but then we must keep pegging away,\r\nand never say die, as long as our grub holds out.”\r\n\r\n“Tis thrue for yez, yez must do that same, an’ be jabers thin, yez’l\r\nbe afther findin’ some toime, if yez sticks to it faithfully, that yez\r\nwill be afther sthriking it rich, and with the bed rock pitchin’ jist\r\nwhin yez are ther laist ixpicting it at all, at all, for that’s the way\r\nit works with all of us.”\r\n\r\nThen Jersey remarked: “Well, boys, what a heap of trouble, vexation,\r\nand disappointment would be saved in this life, if we all knew just\r\nwhere and when to begin; where to stop; when to turn a little to the\r\nright, or when to turn a little more to the left, or just how long to\r\nkeep a goin’ either way in all of our affairs; then, when we come to\r\nget old, and to look back upon our past life, we would escape from all\r\nthe vexation of thinking: oh, now if we had only done so and so at such\r\na time, if we had only gone a little further to the right upon such\r\nan occasion, or a little further to the left at another time, or had\r\nonly quit, or had gone on, or had gone to such a place, how much better\r\nwould it have been.”\r\n\r\n“No, no: not at all, at all!” interrupted Mike, “for if we was all\r\nafther doin’ that same, we wouldn’t be contint at all, no more than\r\nwe are at presint, for then ’twould be ther great quantity we would\r\nall be afther ixpictin’ ther whoile, do yez moind! jist for ther sake\r\nof batin all ther rist of ther bys do yez see, and we wud all be\r\ndisappointed ther same, an now, be jabers! ’tis ther best as it is now\r\nin me own opinion afther all. And thin agin’, me by’s, if all ther\r\nknowledge an’ exparience which it takes a life-toime to learn is all\r\nafther bein’ understood in ther begining, ther problem of life wud be\r\nsolved; but, be jabers, b’ys, what wud sich a life be good for at all?\r\nFray from all vexation and trouble, indade thin we wu’d live like ther\r\nbaists in ther failds; satisfied and contint under any condition, an’\r\nbegorra! we wu’d soon larn to browse by ther wayside, an’ be thankful\r\nfor the loikes of it.”\r\n\r\nJust at this point another old miner, a long lean specimen of antiquity\r\nfrom the State of Arkansas, and who had been asleep in the corner, now\r\naroused up and remarked: “Well boys, that is a fact as Mike says, for\r\n’tis now you do, and then ag’in you don’t; but I never told you boys\r\nhow I got skunked once out of a good claim did I? No, for I don’t like\r\nto tell it, for it has sich a smell that it makes me sick.\r\n\r\n“But this is how I got left, by going a leettle too fur to the right or\r\nto the left, I never knew which.\r\n\r\n“You see ’twas down in Calevaras, along in the spring of 51. I took my\r\ngun one day, and went out a few miles among the hills on a hunt; well I\r\ncome across a deep ravine that looked as though it might be tolerable\r\nrich: it never had been prospected much anyway, and I concluded to do\r\na little panning jest for fun; there were some boys livin’ about two\r\nmiles from this ravine that I knew, so I went over to their cabin, and\r\nborrowed a pick, pan and shovel, and I tell you that I struck it rich;\r\nI found the gravel about four feet deep to the bed rock, and I got as\r\nmuch as ten dollars to a pan. After panning out about $75, I filled up\r\nthe hole again, covered it over with brush, so as to make it look jest\r\nnatural like, and started for home.\r\n\r\n“When I took home ther borrowed tools, the boys wanted to know if I\r\nfound anything over in that ravine where I was prospecting? I said no,\r\nnothing much; but they kinder suspicioned from my looks that I had\r\nfound good prospects; I hurried home, and made up my mind to git my\r\ntools, mining notice and everything ready, and start out early in the\r\nmorning before daylight for my rich ravine.\r\n\r\n“Well I was on the way out thar about daylight the next morning, and\r\nwent around another way, so them chaps that I borrowed ther tools from\r\nwouldn’t see me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKUNKED.]\r\n\r\n“When I had got almost to ther ravine, in crossing over a hill, I jest\r\nran a-foul of a big skunk right in ther trail, I tried to git around\r\nhim, but he walked right up towards me, so I threw down my tools,\r\npicked up some rocks, and went for him; but, somehow or other, I\r\ncouldn’t hit him, and he jest kept on drivin’ me back down ther hill,\r\nbut I picked up a big club and laid him out cold, after foolin’ away\r\nmore’n an hour trying to kill ther odoriferous cuss; then I took up my\r\ntools and hurried over ther hill down into my rich ravine.\r\n\r\n“But I tell you, boys, jest as soon as I come in sight of it I was mad\r\nclean through, now you bet, for right down thar on my rich claim, and\r\nhard at work, was them chaps that I hed borrowed ther tools of; they\r\nhad got ahead of me, while I was foolin’ with that skunk, and hed taken\r\nup the whole ravine.\r\n\r\n“I tried to reason with ther fellers, told them that I hed sunk a hole\r\nthar the day before, and had therefore a right to it; they wanted me to\r\njest show them where I had sunk a prospect hole, so I went to ther pile\r\nof brush, and says I ‘right thar,’ they said thet no hole had ever been\r\ndug thar at all, so I jest kicked away ther brush to show ’em, and I’ll\r\nbe dolgerned, if thar wasn’t a slate ledge right under it; them boys\r\nhad moved that brush either to the right, or a leetle to the left, so I\r\ncouldn’t tell whar ther spot was myself, and thet’s how I got skunked\r\nout of a rich claim.”\r\n\r\n“There,” says Tennessee, “now I have found out ther reason why we never\r\ncould get old Boozer to play a game of euchre with us, he was afraid of\r\ngetting skunked again.”\r\n\r\n“Well, now, old pard,” replied Boozer, “I reckon yer hev struck it\r\nright squar on ther head, don’t want any more of the animile in mine.\r\nWhy, boys, I hev been studyin’ gee-ology and gee-ography for nigh forty\r\nyears, jest to see if I couldn’t find some country whar they don’t\r\nraise skunks, and as soon as I can find one I’m jest agoin’ to emigrate\r\nthar, you bet.”\r\n\r\nAnother miner now explained how it was that he and three others who\r\nowned a valuable mine up in Nevada County lost it. He explained that it\r\nwas an hydraulic mine, and they had used all their means, as well as\r\nmore than two years of hard work, to get started in working it, when\r\nup come the officers and forbid them running their tailings into the\r\ncreek, and he continued by saying:\r\n\r\n“This was an infamous outrage, after having spent our money and\r\nlabor, then to be compelled to quit work just because a few little\r\none-horse ranchers below in the valley made a fuss because our gravel\r\ncovered up their potato patches and radish beds. Now it is plain to\r\nany reasonable, sensible man that mining being the chief industry\r\nof the country, and the original industry, too--for ’tis just what\r\nbrought us all here and nothing else--we have the first right to mine\r\nor to get the gold from the hills in any manner we see fit; and these\r\nranchers have no right to settle upon, or to undertake to cultivate the\r\nground in the valley and on the flats below where our tailings will\r\nlodge. If they do, in my opinion they should be the ones to suffer the\r\nconsequence and not the miners. Why, just see the effect of stopping\r\nall of this hydraulic mining. There is $15,000,000 in gold taken from\r\nour money circulation yearly; now how many centuries would it take them\r\nlittle ranchers to raise that amount of money upon the land that they\r\nsay we have ruined forever? Why, they never could do it, and we have\r\ngot to lose our valuable mining property jest because the judge is agin\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nAt this point Mike interrupted the hydraulic miner by asking:\r\n\r\n“Do you understhand ther raisons why ther judge was aginst ye?” He said\r\nno, he couldn’t exactly understand it, unless he owned a potato patch\r\nhimself somewhere and was afraid it might git covered up.\r\n\r\n“No,” says Mike, “that’s not ther raison at all; for don’t yez\r\nknow that in a fray counthry ther loikes of this, where ther paple\r\nthimselves are ther rale sovereigns, thin it is recognized be universal\r\nconsint, do ye moind, that no man shall be afther following any\r\nbusiness, do yez see, that shall in any manner be afther continually\r\ninjuring or destroying ther property of anither.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” replied the miner, “that is all right, but remember that\r\nthis is a mining country. We were here first and bought our mining\r\nground from the government with the privilege of working it to the best\r\nadvantage.”\r\n\r\n“Faith,” retorted Mike, “‘tis thrue ainough that we miners came here\r\nther first, but, me b’y, that cannot prevint others from comin’ here\r\nand engagin’ in any other koind of business they plaise. Because we\r\nminers came here first is no raison why we should control ther forest\r\nor ther mountain strames. We would have no right, because we was afther\r\nusing ther wathers first to dam them up and prevint thim from running\r\ninto ther valleys below. We have a right to moine, that none can deny,\r\nand in any manner we plaise, so that we aren’t afther harmin’ anybody\r\nelse; but, begorra, thin, have we a right to wash all ther sile from\r\nther hills above into ther valleys and straims below jest for ther\r\ngould that’s in thim, and prevint the paple from making an honest\r\nliving upon the rich flats and bottom lands, that we wud be afther\r\ncovering up with our tailings, begorra. An’ thin agin, if that same\r\nidee or priority of right was the true one, where thin, be jabers, wud\r\nyez be afther stopping, for wouldn’t Mr. Marshall thin who was ther\r\nfirst diskiverer of gould, have ther right as ther first diskiverer of\r\nbossing ther whole business, be jabers.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” says the old miner, “you must admit that the loss to the\r\ncountry of fifteen millions a year is a heavy one to take from our\r\nmoney circulation.”\r\n\r\n“Indade, thin, yez miners who dig it out from ther sile, are not afther\r\nsaying much of ther same. ’Tis thrue that it is not afther drawin\r\nmuch interest whilst lying idle there in ther hills, but, be jabers,\r\n’tis ther safest place to kape it thin, and yez can always find it,\r\nfor there it is; but when ’tis afther gittin into thim bank vaults in\r\nther big city below, divil a bit are yez afther sayin’ ther color ov\r\nit agin, at all, at all. And thin, agin, me b’y, did yez ever know of\r\na miner, or many of thim at laist, who was willin’ to pay ther rancher\r\nfor ther land, fences, or for ther crops they desthroyed? And indade\r\nthin, are yez yourself willin’ to go and pay for ther damages yez wud\r\nbe afther doin’, and don’t yez think that wud be right?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, in some cases, if the ranchers would be satisfied with a fair\r\nprice for damages.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yis! if they wud only let yez, the miners, assess ther damages\r\nthin, but, begorra, ’twud be little ainough they wud be afther\r\nrecaivin, in moi opinion.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I admit,” says the miner, “that ’tis very unfortunate. But we\r\nare not responsible for their loss, for the ranchers should not have\r\nmade their homes in such localities.”\r\n\r\nJersey now asked Mike if he didn’t think that dams could be constructed\r\nthat would prevent the sand and gravel from doing any injury. Mike\r\nanswered “that sich dams wud answer only for a toime, for owin’ to\r\ncarelessness, accident or bad wuork, ther toime wud come whin ther sand\r\nand gravel in thim dams wud all raich ther lower livils be ther natural\r\nlaw of gravity, begorra, and for this raison, in me own opinion, it wud\r\nbe a waste of toime and money to attempt it; but the only way it can be\r\ndone, if at all, wud be to build brush and log dams high up among ther\r\nhills ter kape back ther big rocks and ther coarser stuff, and thin by\r\nther mains of flumes to run ther sand and finer material out upon ther\r\ntule lands.”\r\n\r\nAn old rancher now made the remark that in early days he thought the\r\nminers, or at least a portion of them, were rather of a selfish nature,\r\nand were not disposed to pay much respect to the rights of anybody else\r\nbut the miners.\r\n\r\n“Why, in the opinion of many of them,” said he, “no man had any right\r\nto fence in or to cultivate a piece of ground.”\r\n\r\n“A neighbor of mine in ’53, up in Placer County, had a fine garden; but\r\nit happened to be in the way of some miners who were at work above.\r\nThey tore down the fence and covered ther garden with tailings, and\r\nrefused to pay for any damages, maintaining that the country belonged\r\nexclusively to the miners, and no man had therefore any right to fence\r\nin or to use ground for any other purpose than for mining.”\r\n\r\nAnother old hydraulic miner now remarked that hydraulic mining did not\r\ncause all the injury to the lands and streams in the valleys below\r\nthat it was supposed it did; for the discovery was made by a man up\r\nin the mining region, a very observing man, too, who testified upon\r\nthe stand at Sacramento, during the trial between the miners and\r\nranchers, that a portion of the injury to the farmers, as well as to\r\nthe streams, was caused by the tramping of cattle among the hills in\r\nthe mountain regions, an’ the heavy rains of winter washed this loose\r\nsoil which their hoofs had loosened up into the valleys below, thereby\r\ncausing much of the damage which has been heretofore attributed to\r\nmining. “Now,” he asked, “aint that a very ingenious, as well as a very\r\nreasonable view of the question and who can deny it?”\r\n\r\n“Yis, indade, thin, it is a very raisonable view of ther question,”\r\nanswered Mike, “which none of yez can deny at all: an’ be jabers\r\nthin, he might have included, too, that thim barnyard fowls also in\r\nscratchin’ for ther wurms to fade ther chicky-biddies, loosened up ther\r\nlight sile, do yez moind, an’ ’tis ther jint operation ov these two\r\nmoity forces, begorra, that not only kiver up an’ destroy the potato,\r\nan’ ther turnip patches of ther farmers, but ’tis thim which fill up\r\nther navigable straims too, an’ unless previnted in toime, will destroy\r\nthim all, an’, be jabers, they will transform thim big bays below into\r\nshallow swarmps an’ frog ponds. An’ faith thin,” continued Mike, “I’m\r\nafther thinkin’ that ’tis ther jint operation ov these same tirific\r\nfowl an’ cloven hoofed forces, from havin’ been continualy in operation\r\nthrough long pariods of toime, do yez moind, that have scooped out\r\nthim dape cañons, an’ goughed out thim dape channels ov thim mountain\r\nstraims, too, do yez see; which has been wrongfully attributed by\r\nall ov thim scientific b’ys, as an effect of volcanic an’ of glacial\r\naction, begorra.”\r\n\r\nJim now enquired of Mike, if the fact of their desire to work their\r\nmines was, in his opinion, an evidence that the miners were of a\r\nmore selfish nature than any other class of men, or more inclined to\r\nencroach upon the rights of others? “No, indade, not at all!” Mike\r\nanswered, “but ’tis only in ther opportunity that yez have of showing\r\nit thin, owing intoirly to ther conflict betwain ther two intherists,\r\nthat is av ranching an’ minin’, for human nature is afther being ther\r\nsame in both ov yez; an’ be jabers! if thim hydraulic miners was after\r\nchanging places wid ther ranchers, do yez suppose ther latter wud be\r\nafther stopping ther minin’ business, for fear of injurin’ ther b’ys\r\nbelow, any quicker than ther prisent miners wud do? Divil a bit wud\r\nthey be afther doin’ that same, for, indade, me by’s, we are all ov\r\nus afther being built of ther same material, an’ be jabers! ’tis our\r\ninterests which detarmines ther view that we take ov things after all.\r\nAn’ indade thin,” continued Mike, “I remember a case that occurred\r\nup in ther mountains in early days, that illustrates this p’int. A\r\nminer tore down the fence, an’ run his tailin’s upon the garden ov a\r\nneighbor, ah’ to hear this miner talk ov his rights when the gardner\r\nobjected to the outrage, be jabers, yez wud jest be afther concludin\r\nthat the great Jehovah made ther counthry ixpresly for ther miner, an’\r\nthat noboby else hed any business here at all, an’ that this stoyle ov\r\nman, ther miner, was the only one worth ther trouble av putting ther\r\nbreath av life into at all! at all!\r\n\r\n“Well now, do yez moind, it happened a few years afther that this same\r\nminer was afther tryin’ ther business of ranchin’ himself, an’ about\r\nther same toime, too, this gardner sold out his ranch an’ followed ther\r\nbusiness ov minin’ and, quare enough, he found a good prospect upon\r\nther ranch ov ther other chap, an’ now be jabers! here was ther case\r\njest after bein’ revarsed.\r\n\r\n“It wud hev done yer sowl good to hear this ould rancher, who was now\r\nafther bein’ a miner, jest give it to ther ould miner who was now\r\nafther ranchin’, an’ he paid him off swately in his own kine, begorra!\r\nWell, afther quarrellin’ awhoile about ther rights of aich one, they\r\nfinally was afther concludin’ that both of thim had certain rights, an’\r\nif they were careful and aich one of thim to do ther fair thing, there\r\nwud be no throuble at all, at all, so ther miner agreed to do as little\r\nharrum as possible and fill up his diggings again.”\r\n\r\nJeff now inquired of Mike if he didn’t consider it a great injury to\r\nthe country in general, but more especially to the working classes,\r\nshutting down the hydraulic mines, consequently taking such a large\r\namount of money from our circulation?\r\n\r\n“Ah, yis,” said Mike, “indade thin ’twud be a blessing to ther workin’\r\nmen of ther counthry to have that same in circulation among thim, if\r\nthey was afther handling much of the same; but, me b’ys, I tell yez\r\nthat ther workingmen of the counthry have but little opportunity av\r\naither saing or handling much av ther same at ail, at all.”\r\n\r\n“But,” queried another, “in the circulation of money each one gets his\r\nshare, does he not?”\r\n\r\n“So he ought, thin, if he was afther earning the same; but divil a\r\nbit is he afther doin’ anything ov ther koind, an’ for this raisin,\r\nme b’ys, that if that same was ther rule, why, ’tis plain enough, do\r\nyez moind, that ther more gould there was afther bein’ scattered about\r\namong us, ther greater quantity aich one av us wud be afther gittin’\r\nhould ov, sure. But do yez moind, thin, it don’t wurruk that way at\r\nall, at all. It is not becase thim b’ys who hev scraped togither ther\r\nbiggest share ov money are more selfish than any the rest ov thim,\r\ndevil a bit, but, b’ys, ’tis in ther nature ov gould itself, which is\r\nafther follerin’ a law of its own, begob! an’ has a way ov scrapin’\r\nitself in a hape into ther hands ov a few of ther b’ys, who have\r\nalready more than they are afther having any use for. And ’tis for that\r\nraison, b’ys, that in me own opinion ’tis jest as well for that gould\r\nto remain in thim hills where it belongs, and kape it out of their\r\nhands.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Mike, but that’s a wrong idea you’ve got about money,” remarked\r\nJeff. “Fifteen millions a year from the money circulation means poverty\r\nto many a poor family. Why, what would your little ranch be worth, with\r\nits grapevines and its peach trees, if we should all quit mining? Ain’t\r\nit us miners who give you a market for your stuff?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yis, me b’y, to some extint ’tis thrue that we depind on you\r\nminers to buy much ov our stuff, but not entoirly, thin, begorra!\r\nAin’t it thrue ainough that as ther yaild from ther mines decreases\r\nother industries are containually improvin’ ther whoile in ther same\r\nproportion, be jabers? Indade, thin, to hear some of yez old miners\r\ntalk, we’d be afther thinkin’ that if mining wud stop entoirely the\r\nearth itself wud stop revolving upon its axis thin, an’, be jabers,\r\nall human affairs, too, would jest be afther remaining stationary. But\r\ndivil a bit wud sich a state of affairs occur at all, at all! Thim\r\nriver mines and ther quartz ledges will continue to yaild sufficient\r\ngould for ther business of ther counthry for hundreds of years yit,\r\nwithout the necessity in me own opinion ov coverin’ up and destroyin’\r\nther property or ov fillin’ up ther straims below.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” said the old hydraulic miner, “that is all very well, but\r\nwhat’s to become of all of us miners who are depending for our living\r\nupon the hydraulic mines, and how are we to support our families?”\r\n\r\n“Be jabers, thin!” answered Mike, “yez can be afther doin’ what a hape\r\nov other ould moiners have done, thin, who loike meself couldn’t make a\r\ndacent living at ther business, begorra; fince in thin a paice ov the\r\nsile, an’ plant into it thim grape vines, ther fruit trees, an’ ther\r\nloikes ov thim, an’ be jabers yez’ll be afther foindin in a short toime\r\nthat ’tis ther best an’ ther aisiest way ov fightin the battle ov life;\r\nlyin’ in ambush for yer inimies among the grape vines an’ trees ov ther\r\npaich orchard, or skarmishin’ with distiny from behind a gardin fince,\r\nbegorra! For do yez moind, thin, an’ ’aint ther taties, ther cabbages,\r\nther fruit trees an’ ther loikes of thim, afther growin’ ther whoile\r\nwhin yez are slapein. Now, me b’ys, jest be afther doin’ that same and\r\nyez niver’ll be sighin’ or gravin’ for ther loss ov thim hydraulic\r\npipes that are ther whole toime throwin’ thim grand ould hills into\r\nther vallies below, be jabers!\r\n\r\n“And indade, thin, in obsarving ther immense power ov wather, the aise\r\nand ther great ripidity that yez have in washin’ away thim big hills\r\nfrom above, I have been afther thinkin’ to meself what a foine hand\r\nther Prophet Mahomet wud be after houldin’ if he could only descind\r\nwith his followers from ther heavenly regions above, an’ strike bottom\r\nup in the Sacramento valley.\r\n\r\n“Wudn’t ther b’ys jest, with thim hydraulic giants, be moighty willin’\r\nto accommodate ther auld gintlemen, whin he demanded one of thim big\r\nhills above to jest be afther comin’ down to him thin, an’ they wud\r\nsind it down to him by the aisiest an’ quickest mode of conveyance, be\r\njabers; they wud ship it by wather, C.

Whin ther shallow placer mines\r\nbegun to give out, an’ we could only make small wages, do yez see,\r\nthin ther b’ys commenced to tramp about among ther mountains to hunt\r\nfor richer diggings, for after workin’ such rich claims at first, they\r\nwere not contint to work for smaller wages, an’ ther most of thim spint\r\ntheir money in that way, do yez see, in thrampin’ about ther country\r\nprospecting for richer diggings.\r\n\r\n“An’ thin, agin, the old Forty-niners are as a general rule better\r\nknown and more prominent than any other class thin, an’ many ov thim\r\nbeing poor, yez are all afther concludin’ that we are all afther being\r\nthat same. But do yez moind thin, me b’ys, I tell yez that there’s jest\r\nas great a proportion ov the old pioneers who have made their pile, an’\r\nwho have kept it, as yez’ll be afther findin’ among any other class ov\r\nmin, be jabers. Tis thrue enough, me b’ys, that a very small proportion\r\nov yez old pioneers who are at prisint livin’ in ther minin’ regions\r\nhave saved enough to harrum yez, becase if yez had that same, yez\r\nwudn’t stay here at all, at all, but yez wud be afther strikin’ out for\r\nther big cities below with the rest ov ther b’ys who made their pile in\r\nthe minin’ ragions an’ wint down there to spind it, begorra. A great\r\nmany of thim wint into business in ther big city an’ are in business\r\nyit, many ov them wint Aist an’ hundreds ov thim are now in business\r\nin the cities ov New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, an’ other\r\nplaces, an’ be jabers they are afther houldin their own, too, with ther\r\nbest of ’em. Now, me b’ys, yez know that the greater portion of thim\r\nold pioneers are a long-lived race, an’ be jabers you’ll foind that\r\nthey continue workin’ good pay ground as long as any other class of\r\npaple in ther world.\r\n\r\n“For don’t yez know, b’ys, that no class ov min in any business\r\ncontinue to prosper only about so many years? A great many ov thim in\r\nearly days spent their kine fraly in prospecting thim river beds, in\r\nbuilding quartz mills, as well as in runnin’ long an’ expinsive tunnels\r\nin ther hills in sarching for thim ancient river beds, an’ be jabers!\r\nthey wern’t afraid to spind their kine fraly to develop ther country\r\nfor ther benefit ov all ov yez who was after follerin us to make their\r\npile in ther country, do yez see, now? But the ould time prospectors\r\nare ther poorest ov the lot do yez moind, an’ ’tis for ther raison that\r\nthey spind their toime thrampin’ about among ther mountains searching\r\nfor a rich mine; an’ indade thin ’tis thrue enough that many ov thim\r\ndo succade in foindin one of thim occasionally that was afther havin’\r\na fortune in it, but divil a bit can ther ould-timer work it at all,\r\nfor, be gob, he has no kine to do that same. So ther poor divil, afther\r\nhavin’ spint his toime in huntin’ for a mine, is obliged, do yez see,\r\nto spind more toime in huntin’ for some chap who has got ther kine to\r\nhelp him work it, or else to buy it, an’ he is finally obliged to sell\r\nit for jest what they plase to give him.\r\n\r\n“This is soon spint, an’ thin he is afther commincin’ his endless\r\nthramp agin over mountains an’ through ther various minin’ ragions from\r\nArizona up to ther Arctic ocean, to diskiver anither rich mine to sell\r\nin ther same style. ’Tis for this raison that yez ould prospectors\r\nare afther bein’ continually down on ther bed rock, be jabers! Oh,\r\nyis, ’tis thrue enough, as yez say, that yez have ther pleasure of\r\nthraveling over the counthry an’ of makin’ rich diskiveries for others\r\nto rape ther benefit ov, an’, indade, that is some satisfaction for\r\nyez, be gorra!”\r\n\r\nAnother one remarked that “Some of the reasons why many of the\r\nold-timers were at the present time so poor were that they acquired the\r\nhabit of spending their money freely in early days, because it came\r\neasy and they thought that the rich mines would be more lasting. In\r\nmy opinion, therefore, it is in the nature of the business, as placer\r\nmining was in early days, when wages were an ounce a day and when\r\nhundreds were making double, and even treble that amount daily; such\r\nconditions had the effect to destroy all habits or ideas of economy.”\r\n\r\n“Yis, indade,” said Mike, “but ther great majority of yez niver larned\r\nthe manin’ of ther tarm economy at all, at all. But ’twas not ther\r\nnature of ther business of minin’ entoirly that taught yez to spind yez\r\nmoney so fraely thin; but, be gorra, ’twas natural to ther most ov yez,\r\nan’ indade, thin, ’twas this fault that made yez ther Forty-niners,\r\nan’, be jabers, it saims to stick right by ther most of yez.”\r\n\r\n“That reminds,” said Jeff, “of a remark I heard a Dutchman make once\r\nwho kept a store up on Bear River in ’56. Says he, ‘I could always\r\nshust knows dem ’49 vellers ven dey was come into mine store, mit\r\nmine eyes all shut up.’ ‘I asked him why.’ ‘Vei, den, ven one of dose\r\nvellers comes in to buy sometings, he says, Old vellers, have you got\r\nsome of dot stuff dot vas pooty goot? I says I was. Vell, den, he says,\r\nyou shust fills up mine jug; So I fills up dot jug, and he pays me, und\r\nden he goes right away pooty soon.\r\n\r\n“Vel, den, pooty quick some dose other vellers, he comes in mine store,\r\nund he says, “Jacob, has you got some dem tings?” ‘I speaks to him I\r\nvas. Vell, den, he dells me how I sells dem, and I speaks to him how\r\nmooch.’ “Vell,” he say, “couldn’t you sell dose a leetle more cheaper\r\nas dot.” ‘I speak to him no. Vell, den, he tells me shust to gives him\r\ndrei pints, and put em in mit vour of dose bottles. Vell den he shust\r\ngoes mit de corner round, and dakes up one of dem bottles under his\r\nnose, und pooty soon he speaks, “Jacob, von’t you shust fill up dot\r\nbottles vot leaked out?” ‘So I puts ’em in a leetle more, und den he\r\npays me dem monies, und he goes right away mit dem bottles. Und dot vas\r\nvy I does, ain’t it?”\r\n\r\nAt this point in the conversation in regard to the present poverty of\r\nmany of the old-timers, Jeff remarked.\r\n\r\n“Well, Mike, ’tis true enough that the most of us old prospectors have\r\nfailed in our expectations of making another raise at mining, or at any\r\nrate in being able to save what we have made in the past; yet ’tis\r\nsome consolation for us to know that there was a time once when we were\r\nable to make a big splurge in the big city below when we made them a\r\nvisit with our pockets filled with dust, and give the chaps down there\r\nto understand that we knew where there was a plenty more of the same\r\nsort of stuff when that was gone.”\r\n\r\n“But divil a bit, thin,” retorted Mike, “is ther thought ov thim days\r\nov plinty an big diggins any consolation to yez at all, at all, in\r\nyez ould age. Indade, thin, ther thoughts ov sich prosperity in ther\r\npast only makes our prisint poverty saim ther greater by the contrast,\r\nthin. For, begorra, ther ain’t a divil a one ov us but who’d be moity\r\nwillin’ now in our ould age to swap off all ov thim years that we was\r\nafther splurgin down in thim cities below with our pockets filled with\r\ndust. Yis, indade, we wud swap all ov thim, an’ we wuldn’t be afther\r\naskin’ any boot aither, for just a few short years ov rest an’ quiet\r\nnow in our ould age, fray from want an’ care, without bein’ obliged to\r\nbe containualy thrampin’ about all over ther counthry tryin’ to make a\r\ndacent living.”\r\n\r\nTennessee remarked: “Well, Mike, after all the great uncertainty in the\r\nbusiness of mining, yet there is a fascination about it that many of us\r\ncannot resist, for there is a continual expectation that we will soon\r\nstrike the right spot.”\r\n\r\n“Yis, indade, there is that same, thin, an’, be jabers, I was afther\r\nthinkin’ meself, in early days, that moinin’ was jist ther finest an’\r\nthe most facinatin’ business in ther wuorld; for do yez moind, thin,\r\nit made no difference how much we was afther makin’ on our claim.\r\nWhither ’twas one ounce or tin ov thim, we was always afther ixpictin’\r\nthat ther nixt day ’twud be double, do yez see. ’Twas these containual\r\nixpictations, do yez moind, that made ther business so facinatin’,\r\nbegorra! Whin at wurruk in ther ravine we was ivery day ixpictin’, do\r\nyez moind, that soon we wud be afther jist shovelin’ ther gould up\r\nby ther bucket full, as they did over in Georgetown gulch. An’ thin,\r\nagain, we wud soon be after ixpictin’ to find a rich crivise, when\r\nwe could take out ther gould by ther ton, as they did over in Alder\r\ngulch, Montanna, be jabers. Thin, agin, we was always jist ixpictin’\r\nin our tunnel to sthrike a spot ov blue gravel, whin we wud take\r\nout ther gould by ther car load, as ther b’ys did from Forest Hill.\r\nFaith, thin, me b’ys, ’twas these containual ixpictations in early\r\ndays that made ther business of minin’ so facinatin’, but thin ther\r\ncontainual disappintments that many ov us met with destroys in toime\r\nther facination av their business, an’ we are contint to thry to make\r\na livin’ in some other manner an’ let thim b’ys who havn’t lost ther\r\nfaith in ther business still continue it, in ther hope that some day\r\nyez’ll be afther sthrikin ther right spot, where yez’ll foind a fortune\r\nready waitin’ for yez.”\r\n\r\nSome one asked Mike what had become of his old partner, Pat Kennedy,\r\nwhom he worked with on French Flat in ’54. Mike answered that Pat got\r\nhurt in a shaft up in Placer County in ’56, and died soon after. He\r\nstated that Pat and Uncle Tim Winn were at work sinking a shaft and\r\nthat Tim let the bucket slip out of his hands, and down it went upon\r\nthe top of Pat’s head.\r\n\r\n“I had a talk with Uncle Tim about it,” said Mike, “an’ Tim says to\r\nme: ‘An’, indade, Mike, I was jist afther hookin’ on the tub to sind\r\nit down to Pat, an’ it slipped out ov me hands an’ down it wint, an’ I\r\ntook a glance down the shaft thin, ixpictin’ to see Pat somewhere in\r\nthe last stage ov a rapid decline, do yez moind, but divil a bit was\r\nhe decloinin’ at all, for he was standin’ upon his fate an’ reclinin’\r\nagainst the side ov the shaft. Says I: “Is it much harumed that yez\r\nare, Pat?” “Divil a bit am I at all, but me brains are all knocked out\r\nintoirly, and ’tis spaichless, too, that I am, Tim.”’”\r\n\r\n“Say, Jeff,” says Tennessee, “do you remember Tex who worked with me in\r\nthat gulch down in old Tuolumne? ’twas long in the spring of ’50.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” answered Jeff, “that tall, good-looking, blue-eyed chap.”\r\n\r\n“Well, when I was up in the Salmon River country in ’65, I heard some\r\nof the miners speaking about a chap they called Tex, who was said to\r\nbe an old Forty-niner, and was at work in a cañon a few miles above.\r\nI jest felt that he might be my old pard that I hadn’t seen or heard\r\nof for ten or twelve years, so I found the trail to the cañon and went\r\nup to see him. Yes, sure enough, ’twas Tex; I knew him as soon as I\r\ncome in sight of him. He had found a rich spot and lived like a king.\r\nHe put me onto a good claim in the cañon above him, and I worked there\r\nfor about a year and made quite a raise; but I found the winters too\r\ncold for me up there, so I sold out and left. I tell you but Tex was\r\nclear grit, though. You remember the time when Barton Lee of Sacramento\r\nCity busted up and swindled so many of the boys out of their gold dust?\r\nWell,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GOLD SAVING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nTex had $5,000 worth of gold dust deposited there in Lee’s safe. I\r\nthink ’twas long in the spring of ’50 that we first got the news that\r\nLee had busted. The boys who had deposited their dust with him made a\r\nrush for Sacramento City, now, you bet. But, oh, pshaw! it wern’t any\r\nuse. They couldn’t git anything. A few of them, I heard afterwards,\r\nmade out to git a little something. Well, now, you see, when the news\r\nfirst come up, I asked Tex if he wasn’t goin’ down, for I noticed that\r\nhe didn’t seem to hurry or fret about it. ‘Oh,’ says he, ‘I reckon I\r\nwill, but there’s no hurry about it.’ Now Tex waited for some of the\r\nboys to return, and report what the prospect was, and then he started\r\ndown. I tell you there was black sand in the corner of his eye as he\r\nstepped into the stage the next morning, and says I to myself, ‘Old\r\nBarton, old Barton, take keer of yourself, for you are agoin’ to have\r\na visitor from old Tuolumne!’ Well, upon his arrival in Sacramento,\r\nhe found Lee’s office, and in front of it was a large, powerful negro\r\nacting in the capacity of doorkeeper. Says Tex to him, ‘Is Mr. Lee in\r\nhis office?’\r\n\r\n“‘No, sah, no, sah, he am not, sah!’\r\n\r\n“‘Well, I know a d---- d sight better,’ says Tex.\r\n\r\n“‘Well, you can’t see him, sah, for he’s busy, sah.’\r\n\r\n“But before the astonished doorkeeper could scrape himself together\r\nagain from among the pile of old rubbish in the corner, Tex was inside\r\nthe room, and with the door locked upon the inside.\r\n\r\n“He found Mr. Lee alone, writing at his table. He laid his certificate\r\nof deposit upon the table in front of him, and remarked in a very\r\nquiet, pleasant manner:\r\n\r\n“‘Mr. Lee, that paper calls for $5,000 worth of gold dust, and I will\r\ngive you just two minutes to open that safe and pass it out.’\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lee would like to make an explanation and argue the case; but ‘not\r\na word, sir; when you open that safe, and I find there is no money or\r\ngold dust in it, then I will listen to any explanation which you wish\r\nto give, and not before, so hurry up, if you please.’\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lee then in a very haughty manner turned and looked Tex in the\r\neye. He saw color in among the black sand in the corner of it, fixed\r\nhis eyes upon that funny, innocent-looking gold saving machine which\r\nTex was holding in his hand, slid in a kind of hurried sort of way over\r\nthe back of his chair to his safe, unlocked it, counted out $5,000\r\nall in slugs, put them into a little canvas sack, and handing it to\r\nTex, remarked that it was all right. ‘You bet,’ says Tex, and politely\r\nbidding Barton good-day, he left.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” says another old-timer whom they called Pete, “that reminds me\r\nof another one of the same breed who lived up in Coloma. His name was\r\nCrumie, George Crumie, if I remember. This chap kept a saloon up there,\r\nand I believe was the only one in the camp who had an iron safe at that\r\ntime, for this was along in the spring of ’50, I think. Now, Mr. Crumie\r\nwas a very obliging man, and was willing for us miners to keep our\r\nsacks of dust in his safe. Well, one day Mr. Crumie concluded that he\r\nhad some very important business to attend to in San Francisco, and now\r\nwas a grand opportunity for any of the boys to send down for any little\r\nthing they wanted, as Mr. Crumie was willing to attend to anything of\r\nthat kind, and wouldn’t charge a cent for his trouble. The consequence\r\nwas that he had quite a list of articles to purchase for us, and the\r\ndust in his pocket to pay for ’em.\r\n\r\n“The morning Mr. Crumie left the camp ’twas noticed that his baggage\r\nwas rather numerous, and quite hefty, too, for a man who was jest goin’\r\ndown on business and who was intending to come right back agin, do\r\nyou see. But little attention was paid to his baggage, however, and\r\nall was supposed to be right until a few days after he had left, when\r\nword was brought up to Coloma that Mr. George Crumie was on board of\r\na steamer, and on his way to New York. Upon receiving this unwelcome\r\nnews, the boys concluded that something was wrong. The safe was at once\r\nbroken open, for he had taken the key with him, and found empty. It was\r\nestimated that there was at least $25,000 in gold dust deposited there\r\nby different miners, besides about $7,000 belonging to his pardner,\r\nJohn O’Donnell, who was then living in Hangtown. That explained the use\r\nof them heavy trunks that some of us helped to load upon the stage for\r\nhim the day he started.”\r\n\r\nPete was asked if Crumie had ever been heard of since? “No,” he\r\nanswered, “not that I am sure of; but only a few years ago I was\r\ninformed that a Mr. George Crumie was residing in the city of----, and\r\nfollowing the profession of gambling.”\r\n\r\nTennessee now remarked that there was another little incident or two in\r\nwhich his old pard Tex took an active part that he would like to tell;\r\none of them occurred in a small town upon the Mississippi river near\r\nMemphis, in the fall of ’51. “Tex and I concluded to go home on a visit\r\nfor a short time in the fall of ’51, and on the way we stopped at the\r\nlittle town for a few days to see some old acquaintances, and it was\r\nthere that the little incident occurred. We met rather unexpectedly a\r\nman that we didn’t think of meeting. Of course you all remember that\r\ncompany of outlaws that created so much excitement here in California\r\nin ’49, called The Hounds.\r\n\r\n“There was, I think, about twenty of them, and their object was when\r\nthey first formed to clean out the Mexican horse and cattle thieves\r\nwho infested the central and lower parts of the State at that time.\r\nThey accomplished their purpose, and very effectually, too, in a short\r\ntime, but this job finished what to do next was the question to decide,\r\nwhich they were not long in doing, however, for the precedent had been\r\nestablished many years before by the renowned Captain Kidd, with which\r\nfact they were all doubtless familiar. They therefore decided to go and\r\ndo likewise upon their hook, and roam at will among the hills of the\r\nmining regions, as well as among the ranches of the valleys, as land\r\nbuccaneers.\r\n\r\n“They were a desperate set of men, and had no scruples whatever about\r\ntaking the life of any one who opposed them. Rewards were offered by a\r\ncommittee of citizens for their capture or destruction, and the band\r\nwas finally broken up and dispersed, many of them being forced to flee\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n“One of these Hounds was a man whom Tex had heard of before, and a\r\nfew years previous had resided near the small town where I have said\r\nthat we stopped for a few days. By the way, while in San Francisco a\r\nfew days before starting on our voyage home, by accident Tex picked\r\nup an old handbill from a table in the hotel where we were stopping,\r\nsigned by the committee of citizens and Governor Burnett also, I\r\nthink, offering a reward of $1,000 for the capture of this very man I\r\nrefer to. Well, while sitting in the bar-room of a hotel in the small\r\ntown, in conversation with old acquaintances, Tex made the remark\r\nthat this man, who formerly lived near here, had been a member of the\r\nband of outlaws in California called The Hounds, and inquired if it\r\nwas known what had ever become of him, and I tell you, boys, we were\r\nboth astonished when informed that that man was at the present time a\r\nresident of the place, and was running a faro game in a house across\r\nthe street. We were further informed that he was a very dangerous\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n“Now you may depend that this news to us was not very pleasant at this\r\nparticular time, and if we had known it we should never have mentioned\r\nhis name, but Tex was in for it now, and of course I was bound to stand\r\nby my pard.\r\n\r\n“One of this man’s friends, who was present and heard the statement\r\nfrom Tex, went over and informed him at once that a man at the hotel,\r\nright from California, had stated all the particulars of his connection\r\nwith The Hounds, and of the reward offered for his\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEX GIVES FULL SATISFACTION.]\r\n\r\ncapture. Well, we expected, of course, to receive a visit from the\r\ngentleman, and we didn’t have long to wait, for in a few minutes the\r\ndoor was thrown open and in walked a large, powerfully built man who\r\nwas every inch a Hound, and he showed it in his black, glistening eyes.\r\nHe walked right up to Tex, who was sitting in a chair, and demanded\r\nhis authority for the statement, or instant satisfaction for the foul\r\nslander, at the same time placing his hand upon the handle of his\r\nweapon. Tex drew his weapon instantly, and, rising to his feet, replied\r\nin a very quiet manner:\r\n\r\n“‘Well, sir, you can have both if you wish, and first here is my\r\nauthority,’ at the same time taking the handbill from his pocket he\r\nshook it out, and stepping backwards a few steps to the side of the\r\nroom, fastened it to the wall, remarking: ‘There, sir, is my authority\r\nfor the statement I have made, signed by the Governor, and now if you\r\ndemand satisfaction you shall have it at once, but if you make the\r\nleast motion to draw your weapon you are a dead Hound.’\r\n\r\n“The man immediately left the house, and that night left the town upon\r\nfinding that his friends had all deserted him.”\r\n\r\nOne of the boys asked Tennessee what steamer he sailed on when he\r\nreturned East in ’51, and if there were many other forty-niners who\r\nwent East upon the same steamer? He stated that they took passage in\r\nthe steamer “Sierra Nevada” from San Francisco, and upon the steamer\r\n“Illinois” from Chagres to New York, the latter commanded by Lieutenant\r\nHerndon, who was lost when the steamer “Central America” foundered a\r\nfew years later in the Caribbean Sea. There were about 700 passengers\r\non board the steamer when we left San Francisco, and as near as we\r\ncould judge at that time about 500 of them were Forty-niners. Some were\r\ngoing East to remain, but by far the greater portion were going to see\r\ntheir friends, relatives, and the girls they left behind them, and with\r\nthe intention of returning soon again to California.\r\n\r\nIt was while crossing the Isthmus that another little incident\r\noccurred, in which Tex took an active part. It illustrates the\r\ncharacter of the man, and how ready he always was to help any one in\r\ntrouble. In crossing the Isthmus at that time we traveled on foot or by\r\nmule power to the small town of Golgona, which place is at the head of\r\nnavigation, and from here down the Chagres River by boat to the town\r\nof Chagres. Now, Tex, myself, and a few others, arrived at Golgona\r\nahead of the crowd of passengers from Panama early in the afternoon,\r\nintending, of course, to take passage immediately down the river. But\r\nas we were upon the point of starting we were informed by one of the\r\npassengers of the steamer, John L. Stevens, that a friend of his,\r\nwho was also a passenger upon the same steamer, was confined in the\r\ncalaboose there upon the evidence of one of the natives, who swore that\r\nthe American had refused to pay him for transporting his trunk from\r\nPanama. Upon this accusation the American was arrested and confined in\r\nthe native prison, a large log house near the town. Upon investigation\r\nwe found this man to be a Forty-niner, a man about 60 years of age,\r\nand from the State of Ohio. We were allowed to converse with him\r\nthrough the iron-grated window, and he stated that he paid the native\r\nin advance at Panama one ounce, as agreed upon, for transporting his\r\nbaggage, and didn’t think it right to compel him to pay it again upon\r\nthe evidence of the native.\r\n\r\nTo leave this old Forty-niner locked up was not to be thought of. Tex\r\nproposed, therefore, that we wait until our passengers had all arrived\r\nin the place, then make a demand for his release of the Alcalde, and in\r\ncase of refusal, to release him ourselves and take him down the river\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\nAbout four P.M. the passengers had all arrived and we\r\nwere ready for business. A committee was appointed to wait upon the\r\nAlcalde, a large powerful negro, dressed in full regimentals, with a\r\ncavalry sword suspended to his waist, and explain to him the facts\r\nin the case and demand the man’s release; but the old commander felt\r\nthe dignity of his position, and in a very lofty and dignified manner\r\nrefused to liberate the Americano until he had settled the account.\r\n\r\nSuspecting trouble the Alcalde called out his native troops, numbering\r\nabout 200 men, to guard the prison. They were armed with a great\r\nvariety of weapons, consisting of the old-fashioned flint-lock musket,\r\npistols, swords and clubs. Among them the old style brass blunderbuss\r\nwas numerous, as well as other styles of deadly weapons. I tell you,\r\nboys, they were about as ferocious and formidable a looking set of\r\nwarriors as you would care to run afoul of in a dark night if you\r\ndidn’t know who they were; but during an engagement the safest place,\r\nin my opinion, would be right in front of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEX AT GOLGONA.]\r\n\r\nWell, Tex took charge of the boys, and with a big sledge hammer in his\r\nhand we formed into line between the native troops and the calaboose.\r\nTex drew his watch from his pocket and holding it up before the eyes\r\nof the Alcalde gave him (the latter) to understand, by pointing to the\r\nhands of it, that when the short hand had got to the figure five if the\r\ndoor wasn’t opened he would open it with his sledge, and, furthermore,\r\nif he ordered his troops to fire off their guns and things that some\r\nof them would get badly hurt. The Alcalde drew his huge sword from its\r\nscabbard, flourished it above his head, and at the same time ordered\r\nhis troops to turn around, face the music and make ready, which they\r\nsucceeded in doing after some little trouble; but at the same time Tex\r\nremarked: “Now, boys, show ’em what you’re got, and we’ll soon show ’em\r\nthat we know how to use them, too.” Every man instantly drew his gun.\r\nThey were mostly single-barrelled pistols, although there was a great\r\nnumber of the latest style of revolver, the Smith & Wesson, among them,\r\nbut they were sufficient for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the time was up Tex held his watch up before the eyes of\r\nthe Alcalde, replaced it carefully in his pocket, at the same time\r\nraising the sledge above his head and advancing toward the prison door.\r\nWould the swarthy commander order his troops to fire? He ran his eye\r\nalong the line of his brave army, then took a careful survey of the\r\ncrowd of Americans in front of the prison, and looked at the little\r\ninsignificant weapons that they held in their hands. Would he uphold\r\nthe dignity of his position and give the order to fire and save his\r\nreputation as a warrior? He hesitated; suppose he should get hurt and\r\nhis army annihilated? Taking the key from his pocket he unlocked the\r\nprison door, and the old Forty-niner was free.\r\n\r\nUpon our return to California a few months later the fact had been made\r\nknown that the native did actually receive his pay for transporting\r\nthe American’s trunk. He was tried and found guilty, and the Alcalde\r\nsentenced him to receive 100 lashes and confined him in prison for one\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n TENNESSEE’S LETTER FROM TEX--THE WAR IN CHILI GULCH--SAM BROWN AND THE\r\n CHAP WITH THE MILD BLUE EYES--SAM BROWN AND THE POLICEMAN--OLD KENTUCK\r\n AND SLEEPY BEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother little incident took place on board of the steam ship\r\n“Illinois,” that is worth relating, continued Tennessee “because Tex\r\nbossed the job. When we first went down to the dinner table in the\r\nsteerage, we found that there wasn’t any sugar on the table for our\r\ncoffee; Tex thought that very strange, and turning around to the ship’s\r\nsteward, who was standing in the door of the pantry, inquired of him\r\nif there was any sugar on board? ‘Oh, yes sah’!’ replied the colored\r\nsteward, ’there’s two barrels of white sugar here in the pantry sah;\r\nbut dem is fo’ the cabin sah.’ ‘Well’ says Tex; ‘we must have some of\r\nthat sugar here in the steerage, for we have all paid the price of our\r\npassage, and are just as much entitled to the use of that sugar as the\r\ncabin passengers are, and if you don’t bring it out in two minutes we\r\nwill go and help ourselves.’”\r\n\r\nSo the steward immediately locked the pantry door, and sent word to\r\nthe officers of the ship that there was mutiny among the passengers\r\nof the steerage. In a few moments Lieut. Smith with a guard of six\r\nmarines armed with cutlasses descended into the steerage and demanded\r\nto know what the trouble was. Tex replied that there was no sugar upon\r\nthe table, and as there was plenty of it in the pantry reserved for\r\nthe cabin, the boys had concluded that they were as good as the cabin\r\npassengers, and therefore demanded some sugar. And without meaning to\r\nshow any disrespect to the officers of the ship, sir, yet we must have\r\nsome of that sugar, and we’ll give the steward five minutes to bring\r\nit. If he doesn’t, then we shall be obliged to get it ourselves. The\r\nofficer then ordered the guard to arrest that man, which they started\r\nto do, but as they advanced toward Tex with drawn cutlasses, a hundred\r\nof the old\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “NOT MUTINY, BUT SUGAR.”]\r\n\r\nForty-niners surrounded Tex, and gave the officers to understand that\r\nit wouldn’t be safe to attempt the job. Captain Herndon was immediately\r\nsummoned and drawing his sword demanded of Tex in a very threatening\r\nmanner if it was his desire to raise a mutiny on board of his ship?\r\nTex replied in a very calm and quiet manner, oh, no, not by any means\r\nCaptain, for we are not that style of men at all. We are a lot of\r\nForty-niners on the way to the East to visit the old folks and to see\r\nour girls, and have no desire to raise a mutiny, but we are simply\r\ntrying to raise some sugar.\r\n\r\nCaptain Herndon took a good square look at Tex right in the eye, for\r\nabout a minute; then he ordered the guard to go upon deck, sheathed his\r\nsword, and walking round to the other side of the table where Tex was\r\nstanding, laid his hand upon his shoulder, and with good nature beaming\r\nfrom his eyes said:\r\n\r\n“Then all you are trying to raise is a little sugar is it, sir?”\r\n\r\n“That’s all, Captain, said Tex in a very quiet and polite way.”\r\n\r\n“Well, remarked the Captain and you shall have it. Steward divide that\r\nsugar with the boys in the steerage,” and then shaking hands with Tex\r\nand a few others, he went upon deck.\r\n\r\nSome one asked if Tex was yet alive and where he was; and Tennessee\r\nreplied that Tex returned to his native State about twenty years ago;\r\nbought a ranch somewhere in the northern part of the State; went and\r\ngot married, and settled down for life. He continued by saying that he\r\nheard from Tex occasionally, and said he; “The last letter I received\r\nfrom him was only a few months ago. I have the letter with me now, and\r\nif you would all like to hear what Tex has to say, I will read it to\r\nyou.” Upon all present expressing a desire to hear the letter read,\r\nTennessee took it from his pocket and read as follows:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                 “CALIFORNIA RANCH, JONES CO., TEXAS, }\r\n                                 “September 25th, 1887.               }\r\n“DEAR OLD PARD:--\r\n\r\n“Returning home, after an absence of about three weeks, from Galveston,\r\nwhere I had been with a drove of cattle, I found your letter awaiting\r\nme, and you can imagine the pleasure we all enjoyed in again hearing\r\nthat you are in good health and still continue in the old business of\r\nmining, with fair prospects ahead of you, and we sincerely hope that\r\nyour fullest expectations may be realized from your silver mine up\r\nin Cœur D’Alene. My family are all in the best of health and my two\r\noldest sons are now of that age to be of great assistance to me upon\r\nthe ranch. This, as you know, is quite a pleasant country in which to\r\nsettle down for life, and we are all reasonably contented. For this\r\nreason, I ought not to complain. Yet this is not California, by any\r\nmeans. Although having a pleasant home, yet I am continually thinking\r\nof the happy years I spent in California, and with a desire to make\r\nthat my future home, which I certainly would do if I could dispose\r\nof my property here. You tell me that great changes have taken place\r\nin some portions of the mining regions. That in many places our old\r\npiles of tailings have been levelled down; the places where we mined\r\nfilled up again and planted with fruit trees and grape vines, and also\r\nthat pleasant homes can now be seen among the hills where formerly\r\nall was desolate and dreary, and where in the opinion of all of us at\r\nthat early day no reasons were known why they should not so continue.\r\nYou tell me in your letter that the old-timers are fast disappearing,\r\nand that not more than 500 or 600 are at present living in the mining\r\nregion. This fact I am sorry to hear, although ’tis what must be\r\nfrom the nature of things expected. If circumstances are such that I\r\nshall not be able to sell my property here and remove with my family\r\nto California, I shall, at any rate, make you a visit, perhaps next\r\nwinter; if not, then the winter following, for I tell you, Pard, there\r\nis no spot upon the face of the earth more dear to me, except my home,\r\nor filled with such pleasant associations than the mining regions of\r\nCalifornia, and a residence there of fifteen or twenty years unfits a\r\nman for a residence in any other portion of the Union, or, in fact,\r\nanywhere else. When I come we will get Yank and Jeff, if we can find\r\nthem, and start on a prospecting tour around among the old camps, where\r\nwe mined in early days. We will go to Mokelumne Hill, then over to\r\nAngel’s camp, then up through Jackson in old Amador, and then we’ll\r\nstrike onto our old trail up past Duncan’s store and pan out a few pans\r\non the MacCosmy (Cosumnes). Then, if we have time, I would like very\r\nmuch to visit Chili Gulch, over in Calaveras County, that historic\r\nspot, where you remember the Chileans captured the Kentucky boys. Then\r\nwe’ll strike on to the old trail up through Fiddletown, where we’ll\r\nfind, I think, a few old-timers; then along up through old Hangtown, in\r\nEldorado County, where you tell me that fifty or sixty old Forty-niners\r\nare still hanging out. We’ll prospect around up Cedar, Oregon and\r\nSpanish Ravines, take a look over in the big cañon and at that rich\r\nspot we struck at Poverty Point. We will lay in a fresh supply of\r\nprovisions from Coleman’s store, if he is yet in business in Hangtown,\r\nlay in a few mince pies from Doctor Wakefield’s wife, under the hill,\r\nand continue our prospecting across the South Fork, up through Coloma,\r\nGeorgetown, Spanish Flat, up on around Forest Hill and vicinity, where\r\nthe boys used to roll the dust out by the million. And if we have time,\r\nPard, we’ll visit Nevada, Rough and Ready, Squaw Hollow, Last Chance,\r\nand all other camps and river bars where we used to prospect in early\r\ndays. And I tell you that such a trip, for me, would give me more\r\npleasure than a journey through the Holy Land or any other portion of\r\nthe earth’s surface. Give my best respects to all old acquaintances\r\nthat you run across in your wanderings, and please tell them for me\r\nthat from a residence of about twenty years among the mountain ranges\r\nof California I acquired that trait of hospitality which is peculiar\r\nto your State, and if any of them should ever chance to visit this\r\nportion of the country, they will always find the latch-string hanging\r\noutside the door. Don’t forget, either, what I have before mentioned to\r\nyou, that when the storms of adversity strike you too heavy, or if the\r\nbed rock in the diggings is inclined to buck, and the claim don’t pan\r\nwell, we have an extra room prepared and ready; an extra chair at the\r\ntable, also, always ready for my old Pard which he is welcome to occupy\r\nthe balance of his life. My family join in sending their respects, and\r\nhoping to hear from you soon again, I remain, as ever, Your old Pard,\r\n\r\n                                                                 “TEX.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTennessee having finished reading the letter, and after each one had\r\ngiven his opinion in relation to the kindness and noble qualities of\r\nthe writer of it, it was suggested that they all unite in drinking to\r\nhis health. The toast from old Mike upon the occasion being:\r\n\r\n“An’ now, me b’ys, here’s a long life, hilth and prosperity to our\r\nould comrade, Tex, an’ may the b’ys who are now afther drinkin’ to his\r\nhilth be able to mate togither yearly for the balance ov ther lives an’\r\nrepait the same operation, be jabers.”\r\n\r\nThree cheers were then given for Tex, while old Mike was not forgotten.\r\n\r\nTennessee was asked if he was acquainted with the particulars of the\r\nincident that occurred in Chili Gulch referred to by Tex? He replied\r\nthat he was, as he got the whole account of it from Kentuck, who was\r\npresent and took a part in the affair:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “IT’LL BE OUR TURN NEXT.”]\r\n\r\n“This Chili Gulch is a few miles from Mokelumne Hill and empties into\r\nthe Calaveras River. It was given this name because ’twas discovered by\r\na company of Chileans numbering about thirty, and they had worked there\r\nfor several months, and were taking out gold by the bushel. In the\r\nwinter of ’49-’50 a company of men composed of Texans and Kentuckians,\r\nwith a few from Arkansas and Missouri, numbering about sixteen in all,\r\ncamped near Chili Gulch, and finding that these foreigners were getting\r\nmore than their share of gold, concluded to drive them out and take\r\npossession of these rich claims. They therefore posted notices in the\r\ngulch ordering the foreigners to vacate within twenty-four hours or\r\nsuffer the consequences. But no attention was paid to the order for\r\nthe reason that no law had been passed by the Government to prevent\r\nthem from mining in California. And from this fact they inferred that\r\nthey had as good a right to mine as any one. The miners, finding that\r\nthey did not intend to leave, drove them out by main force and took\r\npossession, not only of their mining ground, but also of their tools,\r\ntents and even of some of their clothing. The Chileans went up to\r\nMokelumne Hill for assistance, but the officers of the law refused\r\nto assist them. The sheriff did, however, in order to get rid of\r\nthem, give them a blank warrant with the privilege of filling it out\r\nand serving said warrant in any manner they pleased. Armed with this\r\nauthority they went early in the morning and took the whole company\r\nof miners prisoners, but unfortunately one Missourian was killed and\r\nanother one badly wounded during the affray. They tied the hands of\r\ntheir prisoners, and driving them along in the road ahead of them,\r\nstarted for the town of Stockton, distant about eighty miles. Kentuck\r\nsaid ‘that they was jist the maddest set of men you ever did see, for\r\nthe idea of bein’ driv along the road like a flock of geese by them\r\nd--d greasers, with their hands tied behind their backs, was terrible.’\r\n\r\n“And said he, if we could only have got loose, we’d have killed the\r\nwhole lot of ’em.\r\n\r\n“They told the greasers that they were playin the trump card with a\r\nfull hand and to make the most of it, for said they it’ll be our turn\r\nnext; and it came sooner than either party expected. They all stopped\r\nat O’Neil’s station, about twelve miles from Stockton, for breakfast.\r\nNow it happened that there were quite a number of travellers and\r\nteamsters who had stopped there the night before and when they saw them\r\ngreasers drive in the boys for breakfast, they were not long in getting\r\nacquainted with the particulars, and whether right or wrong made no\r\ndifference, for they were Americans at any rate. So they charged upon\r\nthem while they were eating their breakfast and bound every one of\r\n’em. Now the scene had changed, and the boys around Chili Gulch were\r\nastonished, a few days after, to see the American boys driving the\r\nChileans before them into camp, all tied in a similar manner as the\r\nAmericans had been. Kentuck said they gave them a fair trial, and\r\nsentenced four of them to be shot. Of course they didn’t know which\r\nones killed their pardner, but it made no difference, to shoot about\r\nfour of ’em would fill the bill anyhow. And said he, the rest of ’em\r\nleft that part of the country in a hurry.\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ said I to old Kentuck, ‘I suppose that you and your company\r\nstaid there and worked out Chili Gulch didn’t you?’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh well, yas we didn’t,’ he replied.\r\n\r\n“And I asked him why not, as there was a good show after they had\r\ndriven out the Chileans.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh yes,’ said he, ‘that was all right, and you see we did start in to\r\nwork, but found the climate so kind er sultry round thar, that we all\r\nconcluded to find a more salubrious clime further north.’\r\n\r\n“I asked him to explain what he meant; and said he.\r\n\r\n“‘A few days after we started in to work, some of the miners around\r\nthar had a sort of a miners’ meetin’ one day, and so they come over\r\ninto Chili Gulch and stuck a paper up on a tree with some writing on it\r\nfor us to read, and so we did.’\r\n\r\n“I asked Kentuck if he remembered what it said.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh yas,’ says he, ‘I do, first rate, for I’ve got an awful good\r\nmemory. It said that if any of them fellers what driv out, and shot\r\nthem Chileans, was found mining over there in Chili Gulch, that the\r\nminers round in them diggings would hang every derned one of em. Now\r\nwer’nt that too sultry for comfort old pard, and wer’nt it time to hunt\r\nfor a more salubrous atmosphere?’”\r\n\r\nTennessee was asked if he was with Tex up in Tuolumne in ’56 or ’57, at\r\nthe time he had the trouble with Sam Brown.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes,” he replied, “I was near there at that time, but there wasn’t\r\nmuch trouble, anyhow. The way it was: you see some one had told Brown\r\nthat Tex made the remark, that it would be much better for the country\r\nif Brown was out of it. This, of course, was enough for Brown, and\r\nswearing vengeance he went on a hunt for the man Tex, and he found him.\r\nNow Brown had heard of Tex, but never had seen him, for Tex was at work\r\ndown in the gulch and seldom went up into town; but one day he had some\r\nbusiness up at Mokelumne Hill, and Brown was informed of the fact and\r\nstarted out to find him. Tex was pointed out to him, so Brown crossed\r\nthe street, and stepping in front of him demanded to know if he had\r\nmade such a remark which he repeated, at the same time placing his hand\r\nupon his weapon.\r\n\r\n“Tex asked, ‘is this Sam Brown? at the same time placing his hand upon\r\nhis gun.\r\n\r\n“The latter answered that such was his name.\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ says Tex, ‘I did make that remark and meant it too, and\r\nam willing to make the same remark again to your face, if ’tis any\r\naccommodation to you, and now what are you going to do about it?’\r\n\r\n“Brown took a good square look at that quiet, good natured blue eye\r\nof Tex’s, removed his hand from his weapon, and remarked as he turned\r\nto leave, ‘oh nothing’; some one asked Brown why he didn’t go for Tex?\r\n‘Oh!’ says he, ‘I don’t want to quarrel with that man.’”\r\n\r\nBrown was a noted desperado, a fine looking man, with long curly hair\r\nof a sandy color; he was rather of a good natured disposition when\r\nperfectly sober, but a demon when drinking.\r\n\r\nIt was said of him that he had killed in the short space of ten years\r\nabout a dozen men; but, somehow, he always got clear by pleading self\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nBut his career ended in Carson Valley some time in ’63 if I am not\r\nmistaken, when Vansickles, with a few others overtook him on the road\r\nwith their shot guns, and without the formality of a trial filled his\r\nbody with buck shot.\r\n\r\nJersey remarked that there was a good story told about Brown, the\r\ncircumstances of which occurred in some mining camp in the State of\r\nNavada. Brown had butchered a man in self defence, as he usually\r\nclaimed, but the authorities thought otherwise and determined to arrest\r\nhim; but where was the officer who was willing to take his chances,\r\nand make the arrest. An ex-policeman in San Francisco who had monkeyed\r\nwith that style of man, as he supposed, learning of the situation,\r\nvolunteered to make the arrest, and was tendered the job.\r\n\r\nBrown was informed of the fact, and patiently watched for the coming\r\nman. Upon the arrival of the stage into town containing the policeman,\r\nBrown was at his post waiting to tender him a cordial reception, and as\r\nthe former opened the stage door to alight, Brown ordered him to remain\r\nright where he was, and enjoy a ride at his (Brown’s) expense, and then\r\nordered the driver to take him away out of town, which he did.\r\n\r\nAnother old-timer asked Tennessee if he knew what had become of old\r\nKentuck and his partner, Sleepy Ben? The former answered that it was\r\nnever known what had become of them. They were either killed by the\r\nIndians or lost in the mountains some time in ’54.\r\n\r\n“You know that after they had worked out that rich claim in the winter\r\nof ’49-’50 in Georgetown cañon, they went the next season up on\r\nMurderers’ Bar, on the Middle Fork, where they did well. The following\r\nseason they commenced work on the river,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAM AND THE POLICEMAN.]\r\n\r\nbut luck was against them and they were washed out for two seasons\r\nin succession. In ’53 they went into the mountains on a prospecting\r\nexpedition, and returned in the fall with some of the finest specimens,\r\nand the biggest, that you ever did see. They struck a rich cañon\r\nsomewhere at the north, and we all tried to find out where it was, but\r\nit wasn’t any use, and it never has been found yet. Well, they started\r\nin the spring of ’54 for their rich cañon, and that is the last that\r\never has been heard of Kentuck and Sleepy Ben. It was very early in the\r\nspring when they started, and the supposition was that they got lost in\r\nthe snow, and were frozen or starved to death.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n YANK VISITS THE OLD MINING CAMP--YANK SEATED ON THE BOULDER--THE\r\n FIRST LOAF OF BREAD--THE BEAN-POT COMET--HOW JULIUS SAILED UP THE\r\n RIVER--JEFF’S PLUM-DUFF--THE STONE STATUE--THE OLD MINER WHO WAS\r\n ROBBED ON BOARD THE STEAMER--THE CŒUR D’ALENE MINES--COASTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the company remarked, with rather a sad expression of\r\ncountenance, that the last time he went through the mining region in\r\nthe central counties, where he mined in earlier days, it actually gave\r\nhim the blues to see those small villages and mining camps now all\r\ngoing to ruins and not a single sluice or tom at work for miles around,\r\nexcept once in a while by a Chinaman.\r\n\r\n“Why, them confounded ranchers,” he continued, “are jest fencin’ in the\r\nwhole country, and settin’ out their grape-vines and orchards right\r\nwhere we used to jest roll out ther dust. Why, if them chaps keep on a\r\nspell longer, nobody will know that there has ever been any minin’ done\r\nthere at all.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, say, Jim, when were you up in Eldorado County last!” asked Yank,\r\nan old-timer, of an old pardner whom he had just met for the first time\r\nin many years.\r\n\r\nJim replied that he had never been to that part of the country since he\r\nleft it in ’53.\r\n\r\n“But that was a rich gulch that we worked over there by Mosquito cañon,\r\nwern’t it?” said Yank.\r\n\r\n“Well, I should say it was, and good two-ounce diggins’ every day. I\r\nwould jest like to strike another sich a claim as that now.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” says Yank, “do you remember old Buckeye, the chap with the\r\ncrooked nose?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes! yes indeed. You remember I called him old corkscrew. But have\r\nyou ever run afoul of him in your travels?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Yank, “and I’ll tell ye how I happened to strike him\r\nlast fall. You see I had been prospecting around up in that new silver\r\nminin’ region in Northern Idaho, and as soon as the snow begun to fall\r\nI concluded to make tracks for California, so I came down through\r\nMontana into Nevada, but didn’t see any thing worth stayin’ there for.\r\nWell, on my way over from Nevada, I concluded to come around on that\r\ndivide, take a look around the country above Georgetown, and take\r\na walk over to that gulch, near Mosquito Cañon, where we worked in\r\n’50. But I tell you I hardly knew the place, for I had to climb over\r\nfences, travel through vineyards and orchards, and in one place I come\r\nacross the biggest swarm of children that you ever did see, and it did\r\nseem strange to see so many children livin’ where only a few years\r\nago was nobody but grizzlys and Indians. I asked a little black-eyed\r\nchap where they all came from, and he said that building over there on\r\nthe hill was a school-house, and the children all lived around in the\r\nneighborhood. I asked him if their parents were mining?\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, no,’ said he, ‘they was most all ranchin’, some few of em were\r\nminin’ down in the cañon and some were workin’ in their tunnel claims\r\nin the hills.’\r\n\r\nI asked him if there was any more children in that part of the country.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh,’ says he, ‘I reckon there is; for right over there by the cañon\r\nis a big school house that’s chock full of children, and over there in\r\nthat ravine they are jest buildin’ another one and that’ll soon be full\r\nof children too, you bet.’\r\n\r\n“The boy put me on the trail to the cañon, and I soon found the gulch\r\nwhere we mined nearly forty years ago. ’Tis all fenced in now, and the\r\nground where we worked down in the gulch is all covered with fruit\r\ntrees. You remember that great quartz boulder, Jim, that slid down off\r\nthe bank one day and came near smashing some of us?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, first rate,” answered Jim.\r\n\r\n“Well, that great boulder lies right there yet in the same spot and\r\njest looks as natural as life. I lit my pipe and took a seat upon it,\r\nas we used to do, you remember, and thought of old times, and wondered\r\nwhat had become of my old pardners, Jim, Buckeye and Kentuck. I found\r\nthe old cabin that we built, or what is left of it, but it has been\r\nfixed up, and two or three chaps are livin’ in it, who are at work for\r\nthe man who owns the ranch. I took a walk up towards the old cabin\r\nand see two of them chaps grinding an axe out in front of it. Do you\r\nremember, Jim, the time that I went over to Georgetown and bought that\r\nDutch oven?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YANK REVISITING THE OLD SCENES.]\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, I do, and old Buckeye called it a donkey baker, because\r\nthere was a big cross upon the inside of the cover, and I remember,\r\nYank, how you bragged that you was jest a-goin to show the boys what\r\ngood bread was when it come your cook week agin. Ha! Ha! and I remember\r\nthat first loaf you baked, too, and how we had to drill and blast it\r\ninto small pieces before we could eat it.”\r\n\r\n“But don’t you remember the next loaf I baked was so infernal hard,\r\nJim, that you broke the drill tryin’ to put in a blast?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you bet I do, Yank.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you’ve got an awful good memory, Jim; and you remember I threw\r\nthat loaf of bread out among the ashes in front of the house, Yank?”\r\n\r\n“Well, now, listen. I see them chaps at work up there in front of the\r\ncabin grindin’ an axe, and I could hear one of ’em growlin’ and cussin’\r\nabout somethin’, so I walked up that way to have a talk with them. They\r\ntold me that they had been to work mor’n two hours tryin’ to grind the\r\naxe on that grindstone, but ’twasn’t worth a cuss. I asked them where\r\nthe stone came from, and one of them said that he found it among that\r\nold pile of ashes and tried three or four days to git a hole through it\r\nso they could use it.\r\n\r\n“‘Out of the ash heap,’ said I, ‘that’s queer.’ I stepped up close to\r\nget a good look at it, and what do you suppose I see, Jim? Why, on the\r\nside of the stone was a big cross, and I’ll be dolgerned if they wasn’t\r\nusing that loaf of bread for a grindstone that I throw’d out there\r\nnearly forty years ago, just as sure as you live. Well, I asked the\r\nchap how they got a hole through it. He said they tried every way they\r\ncould think of, but ’twas no use.\r\n\r\n“‘One day there was a thunder shower comin’ over, and the Boss, he\r\nfastened a wire to it and then run the ’tother end of the wire ’way up\r\nto the top of a hop-pole. Well, the lightnin’ struck it right square in\r\nthe center, and it jest tore the lightnin’ all to pieces, but didn’t\r\nhurt the stone a bit.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well, well,’ says I, ‘that beats anything I ever heard of. But,’ I\r\nasked, ‘how did you make out to git a hole through it at last?’\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ says he, ‘I’ll tell ye. A man over the hill yonder was down\r\nhere to the ranch ’tother day looking at the stone, and he told the\r\nBoss to bring it over to his ranch and he would drill a hole through\r\nit for him. So we took it over thar and he did it. You see, he has\r\ngot on his ranch a real knowin’ sort of mule, who’s always willin’ to\r\ndo anythin’ you want done, if he can do it. So the rancher made the\r\nstone fast to a tree behind the mule, fastened a drill to the mule’s\r\nhind foot, and then begun to tickle the mule behind his ear with a\r\nlong straw, and in about three minutes he drilled a hole right square\r\nthrough the middle of the stone.’\r\n\r\n“Then I up and told him what that stone was and the reason why they\r\ncouldn’t grind an axe on it, and showed him the cross on the inside of\r\nit, and how it was marked from the cross on the inside of the cover of\r\nthe bake-oven.\r\n\r\n“The chap who had told me all about drilling the hole through it,\r\nturned his eye up towards me and remarked that he thought I had better\r\nbe goin’ pretty soon, for the Boss might be comin’ down that way. I\r\nasked him why? He said there was a notice jest above thar on the fence\r\nthat no old Forty-niners were allowed to come about on the ranch. I\r\nasked him the reason why, and he said that he couldn’t exactly tell\r\nwhat the reason was, but said he (the Boss) was an old Forty-niner\r\nhisself and maybe he could tell me. I then asked the chap if he was an\r\nold-timer too. He said no, but that he had an aunt who was.\r\n\r\n“‘I thought so,’ said I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW MOTOR.]\r\n\r\n“Well, just then there come walking down towards the cabin a large,\r\nheavy-built, gray-headed man, the boss of the ranch, as they informed\r\nme. He had, as I thought, a familiar look, and as he came nearer, Jim,\r\nblamed if there wasn’t that corkscrew! Yes, sure enough, ’twas our old\r\npard, Buckeye.\r\n\r\n“He knew me at once, and we spent nearly half a day in talking about\r\nold-times, and enjoyed a jolly laugh over that grindstone. He has a\r\nfine ranch; lots of fruit, as well as a very smart-looking woman for a\r\nwife, and four or five children.\r\n\r\n“He tried to persuade me to take up a piece of land near him, get\r\nmarried and live like white folks.\r\n\r\n“But I told him that I was too old to start into an arrangement of that\r\nkind now, and should continue in the occupation of mining the balance\r\nof my life.”\r\n\r\nIn this manner the old-timers continued throughout the day in calling\r\nup old scenes and incidents of early days.\r\n\r\n“We are getting pretty well along in years, boys,” says Jersey, “but we\r\ncan do a heap of prospecting yet, though. And who knows but what there\r\nmay be a chance to make a big stake before we go, and some of us old\r\nprospectors come up to the top of the heap yet.”\r\n\r\nAnother old-timer now attempted to relate his experience in cooking a\r\npot of beans for the first time, when he was suddenly interrupted by\r\nJulius, a venerable colored individual from the city of Boston, who was\r\nformerly cook on board of some Boston ship that arrived in California\r\nin the year ’49.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sah! now I spose you is jes’ gwine to spress yer ignorance on\r\nde bean cooking question sah! jes’ as all ob dem gemman did who was\r\nignorant ob de cookin’ art, sah; an’ who am deficient in de high\r\nculture necessary for de casion, sah. I tells ye dat de ignorance ob de\r\ngemman in de early days was mos’ stonishing when dey fills de pot chuck\r\nfull ob de beans, an’ den, as dey swell up an’ fill de pot chuck full,\r\ndey jes’ scoop ’em out, ’til dey fills all de old pots an’ pans about\r\ndere house wid dem half-cooked beans. Yes sah! one ob dose uncultivated\r\nindividuals way down in Calaveras, one day in ’50, jes’ filled his\r\ndinner pot chuck full ob beans, an’ when dey undertook for to swell\r\nup, he jes’ takes a big chain an’ lashed de kiver down to keep ’em in\r\nde pot. But I tole him dat it wernt no use to do dat, kase de swellin’\r\nproclivities ob dem beans am so powerful, sah! dat you might jes’ as\r\nwell try to spress wid a big chain dem gentle swellin’ proclivities ob\r\nde bosom ob! ob!--”\r\n\r\n“Of what Julius?”\r\n\r\n“Ob de ocean, de ocean sah.”\r\n\r\n“Well Julius, did the pot cover blow off?”\r\n\r\n“No, sah; but de whole pot, kiver an’ all, jes blowed up froo de roof,\r\nan’ away it went sailin’ froo de air ober de country towards Bosting,\r\nsah, wid dem beans jes’ er streamin’ along after it. De miners tink it\r\nam a comet, suah, wid a long tail jes’ er scatterin’ de fire an’ de\r\ngrabel stones all ober de country.”\r\n\r\n“Julius,” one of the boys asked, “did you see this bean-pot comet\r\nyourself?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” he answered, “I jes’ specks I did, boss, kase I was right dar\r\ndurin’ de ’currence ob dat berry interestin’ ’casion, sah.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BEAN-POT COMET.]\r\n\r\nYank suggested to him that as it was getting late he had better go home\r\nand feed his pigs.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sah! yes, sah! I is gwine, sah.” But as he was about to leave,\r\nsome one asked him to tell the boys how his company sailed up the\r\nSacramento river in ’49, as they had never heard the facts related.\r\n\r\n“Well” Julius replied, “de fac’ am, sah, dat before de Lord, I is\r\nunwillin’ to gib de gemmen a girafic scription ob dat wonderful\r\ncurrence, sah.”\r\n\r\nWhen asked for his reason, he replied: “Dat it might hab de\r\ntendency, sah, to frow some ’spicion upon de veracitude ob de honest\r\nForty-niners, sah.”\r\n\r\nBut upon being assured that the veracitude of the Forty-niners was\r\nnever doubted, he related that the company he was with numbered sixteen\r\naltogether, and they left San Francisco in a large yawl boat for\r\nSacramento City about the middle of July ’49, and after pulling for\r\nabout two days in the hot sun, in the evening they made the boat fast\r\nto a bush on the bank of the Sacramento River for the night.\r\n\r\n“Well, gemmen,” he continued, “we soon found dat we had jes’ gone an’\r\ntied up ’mongst de biggest an’ de awfulest lot of skeeters dat you eber\r\nsee in all your born days. Why, sah, we couldn’t cook nuffin, kase jes’\r\nthe minit we went to open de tater sack, dem skeeters would jes’ light\r\non it, an’ fly away wid ebery bless’d one ob ’em. Oh, I tells you,\r\ngemmen, dem was a powerful breed ob skeeters an’ no mistake, regular\r\nForty-niners, suah.”\r\n\r\nSome one enquired how they managed to cook?\r\n\r\nHe replied, “we cooked nuffin, an’ eat nuffin, kase jes’ de minit we\r\nwent to put de food in our moufs, dem savage reptiles would jes’ swoop\r\ndown wid dere long bills an’ grab it right away from us. Well, sah, so\r\nwe jes’ takes our sail an’ kivered ober the boat, an’ all hands turned\r\nin ter sleep fo’ the night. But, gemmen, when we come fo’ to turn out\r\nin de mornin’, an’ look out the tent we was jes’ de most astonished set\r\nob individuals, sah, dat you eber seen, kase we foun’ dat we had gone\r\nan’ sailed up dat riber in the night sah; clar up to Sacramento City\r\nfo’ suah; but how in de name ob de Lord we hed got up dar, was de mos’\r\n’stonishing subjec’ for ’cussion sah.\r\n\r\n“When we come for to ’vestigate, an’ take a view ob de situation, we\r\nfoun’ out jes’ de way ob de whole truff, fo’ jes’ as suah as you lib,\r\ngemmen, dar was our line stretchin’ way out ahead ob de boat, sah, all\r\nkivered ober wid dem immense insects; dem Forty-nine skeeters. You mus’\r\nunderstand, gemmen, dat dat line ob ourn was a tarred rope, an’ de hot\r\nwedder jes’ made it awful sticky. Well, you see dat dem skeeters went\r\nan’ used dat ar tarred rope for der roos’ in de night, an’ when dey\r\nfeet was once on dat line dey was dar fo’ good. In de night, when de\r\nboss skeeter ordered all hands up to tend to their duties, dey jes’\r\ntook de line an’ all along wid ’em right op de riber, an’ fo’ de Lord,\r\ngemmen, dat was de way we done sailed up de Sacramento Riber.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOSQUITOES.]\r\n\r\nSome one asked Julius about the size of them mosquitoes. He replied,\r\n“Well, now, about de size ob dem animals, you is axin me too much, kase\r\nwe didn’t hab any rule or chalk line on de boat to measure dem wid; but\r\nI tells yer for a fac’, gemmen, dat we kotched de whole lot ob ’em,\r\nchopped of dare bills, sah; an’ sold ’em to de hotels in de city.”\r\n\r\nWhen asked what use they made of them at the hotels, he said that they\r\nused ’em fo’ toothpicks.\r\n\r\nAfter bidding all hands good bye, and with an earnest wish that they\r\nmight all live to enjoy many such pleasant meetings and to talk about\r\nold times, Julius departed.\r\n\r\n“That story about the loaf of bread,” said Jeff, “reminds me of a\r\nspecimen of my cooking, once upon a time. It was up in Shasta County\r\nalong in the winter of ’50. There were four of us in company, and we\r\ntook regular turns to display our science in the cooking art. Well,\r\nI concluded once, when it come my week to git up the grub, to give\r\nthe boys something new in the grub line, a regular old-fashioned\r\nplum pudding, or plum-duff as they called it on board the ship on\r\nour voyage around the Horn. I never had made one, but I had seen the\r\nship’s cook get them up, and I was confident that I could fix one up\r\nin the same style, and I thought ’twas no trick at all. Just take some\r\nflour, put it into a sack, slap in some water, you know; throw in some\r\nsalt, a little spice, a hunk of butter, and then some dried apples,\r\nif there ain’t any raisins around, then some eggs, and that ends the\r\nprogramme. Then shake ’em all together a spell, put the sack in the\r\nkettle and let her bile till ’tis done, and you have got something\r\nfit to eat, or anyway you oughter have if ’tis mixed all right; but,\r\nboys, in making that duff I made a mistake somewhere; for after I had\r\nbiled it for about six hours, and come to put it on the table jest\r\nto see how astonished the boys would look, I tell you what we were\r\nall of us astonished to find that the derned thing was so tough that\r\nwe couldn’t cut it with a knife. So one of the boys, after chopping\r\noff a slice of it with the axe to tap his boots with, threw it out of\r\nthe door and it rolled into a prospect hole, and ’twas good-bye duff\r\nfor a time, but not forever. A day of resurrection came for my duff.\r\n’Twas about fifteen years afterwards that some miners at work there\r\nground-sluicing away the bank, found it. It was a great curiosity, for\r\nno such spotted stone had ever been found around them diggings before,\r\nand many opinions were given by those who claimed to be well posted in\r\ngeological science, and ’twas real interesting to hear them explain\r\nwhat kind of mineral it was, and the different elements ’twas composed\r\nof; how old it was, what era or period it belonged to, etc. Well, boys,\r\nI could have told ’em very quick all about its age, eras, periods, and\r\nits dufferdom elements, for I knew what it was the minute I see it, but\r\nI didn’t want to let the cat out of the bag, for I was always sorry\r\nthat I let the duff out, so I kept shady. There was a little hollow\r\non one side, where one of the boys chopped the slice off to tap his\r\nboots with, so the boys who found it used it for a number of years as\r\na mortar to prospect quartz with. Well, one day there was a scientific\r\nman, a professor from some part of Europe, around viewing the country,\r\nand hearing about the curious stone, he went to see it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCIENCE AND PLUM-DUFF.]\r\n\r\n“After examining it carefully all over, he said:\r\n\r\n“‘I would like to see ’em inside.’\r\n\r\n“Well, they informed him that if he would buy it he could break it open\r\nand see what was inside it. So he bought it for a trifle and he got one\r\nof the boys to take a beetle and wedge and split it open.\r\n\r\n“The Professor took the pieces up carefully in his hand, put on his\r\ngold specks, and after looking at the stone for a minute, said:\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, mine gracious, shentlemens, does you know vot I was found here;\r\ndis vas vonderful; vo here in dis stone I does found dem leetle\r\ncommencements ov our lives.’\r\n\r\n“Then he told us that the soft stuff that he found in the center of it\r\nwas spasms-splasms. It sounded something like photo, or protoplasms. He\r\nwas very much excited over it, and said he:\r\n\r\n“‘I takes dis vonderful stone to Sharmany mit me, because you Americans\r\ndon’t understand about dese tings so mooch.’”\r\n\r\nSome one asked Jeff if he had ever heard anything about the Professor\r\nor his duff, since.\r\n\r\n“Well,” says Jeff, “a short time ago I saw the picture in some\r\npictorial paper of a stone statue that was erected somewhere in Europe\r\nin honor of some great scientific man who had recently died, and he\r\nwas holding in his outstretched hand a great round spotted stone. And,\r\nboys, blamed if it didn’t look exactly like that same old plum-duff\r\nthat I biled for the boys up in Shasta nearly forty years ago, and I’ll\r\njest bet it was, too.”\r\n\r\nSome one present asked Yank if his old pard, who was robbed of part\r\nof his gold dust on his way home in ’51 on board of the steamship\r\n“Illinois,” ever recovered it. Yank replied that he never did, and,\r\nbeing requested to relate the particulars, he stated that his pard made\r\na visit to his friends in the East in the fall of ’51, and was robbed\r\non the way home by a gambler by the name of----.\r\n\r\n“He took advantage when my pard had gone up on deck for a few minutes\r\nand went to his bunk, cut open his valise and took from a buckskin belt\r\ntwo purses containing $800 or $1,000. Miller was arrested upon arrival\r\nin Panama and thoroughly searched, but nothing could be found upon him.\r\nHe had an accomplice on board who secreted it for him. Perhaps some\r\nof you remember this man. He was not a regular gambler, but what they\r\ncalled a bar-room scrub-gambler, and would, in company with a few\r\nothers of the same species, sit at a little table in one corner and\r\nplay poker for ten cents ante day and night. When my old pard decided\r\nto return home this scrub-gambler concluded to go in the same steamer.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MILLER TAKING AN UNJUST TOLL.]\r\n\r\nUpon being assured by two or three present that they remembered the\r\ngreat tall saloon bummer, Yank continued by saying that upon the\r\narrival of the steamer in New York his pard secured the services of\r\na detective to watch----., who was followed a few days after their\r\narrival into the banking house of Beebe & Co., on Wall street, where\r\nhe sold about $800 worth of gold dust. A description of the appearance\r\nof certain specimens among the dust was given the detective, and he\r\nfound upon an examination of it that it answered the description and\r\nwas, no doubt, the stolen dust. The detective explained to the bank\r\nclerk that the gold had been stolen, and requested that it be laid to\r\none side until he could send for the owner of it, but owing to some\r\nmisunderstanding among the clerks, when the detective returned with the\r\nForty-niner to the bank later in the day, they found that it had been\r\nsent to the Mint in Philadelphia only an hour before. They therefore\r\nboarded the next train, and, upon their arrival at the Mint, found that\r\nthey were about ten minutes too late; it had gone into the melting pot.\r\n\r\nUpon some inquiry being made in regard to----, Yank stated that by a\r\nperson, who was acquainted with him, he was informed that the gambler\r\nhad prospered pretty well in life, had a family, was at present in good\r\nhealth, and loved to boast among his acquaintances of the high and\r\nexalted position that he once held as Alcalde and Justice of the Peace\r\nin Hangtown, California, forty years ago.\r\n\r\nYank was asked if he ran across many of the old-timers during his late\r\nprospecting expedition at the North?\r\n\r\nHe replied that he found them in almost every mining camp. “I met three\r\nold acquaintances up in the Salmon River country that I hadn’t heard\r\nfrom for more than thirty years, and they informed me of quite a number\r\nwho were at work in the Snake River country. Then I found some eight\r\nor ten of the old Forty-niners up in the Cœur D’Alene silver region. I\r\nmet one whose name is Sam Black. He was a passenger in the ship “Gray\r\nEagle” from Philadelphia, in ’49, and at one time in early days worked\r\nnear Hangtown. Sam is now prospecting a silver ledge, and also working\r\nNine-mile Cañon with a bed rock flume, from which he expects to make\r\nmoney enough to enable him to return once more to San Francisco and\r\nspend the balance of his days among his acquaintances, for he thinks\r\nhe has done his share in tramping through cañons and over mountains,\r\nhunting for mineral, and feels now like taking a rest. All of these\r\nold-timers are confident now that they have at last struck the right\r\nspot, and like the balance of the oldtime prospectors who are yet in\r\nharness, they have magnificent prospects just a little ahead of them,\r\nand are living in full expectation of one day in the near future\r\nstriking it immensely rich. They hope to have the satisfaction, at\r\nleast when it comes their turn to pass, even if they haven’t enjoyed\r\nthe pleasure during life of holding a full hand, to leave a good hand\r\nand a big pot for the benefit of those who will take their places to\r\nfinish out the game.\r\n\r\n“To the old-timers this is a great consolation, ain’t it, b’ys?”\r\n\r\n“You bet it is,” was the general response.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DONKEY PROSPECTOR.]\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” he replied, in answer to an inquiry, “there are a great many\r\nForty-niners now living in the State of Nevada; some are hunting for\r\nmineral and quite a number are engaged in ranching. An old acquaintance\r\ntold me that he met quite a number of the old boys in the mining region\r\nof Colorado, and a few of them in Utah.”\r\n\r\nAn old miner enquired of Yank what the prospects were up in the Cœur\r\nD’Alene silver region. He replied that from what he saw up there he\r\nwas satisfied that it would prove to be a very rich mining region.\r\nThere are now a number of mines from which they are shipping tons of\r\nore daily, but the hills in this region have not yet been prospected\r\nonly to a small extent, and in my opinion many richer mines will be\r\nyet discovered than they are working at present. Another one enquired\r\nof him how they happened to discover this silver region, and who\r\nmade the first discovery. Yank stated that they were discovered by a\r\nparty of prospectors who came over the summit of the mountains from\r\nthe gold regions of Pritchard and Eagle creeks to prospect for gold.\r\nThese were a man by the name of Kellogg and the other was Phil O’Rouke.\r\nThey packed their tools and grub over upon a donkey. After prospecting\r\naround for a few days among the ravines and cañons and finding nothing,\r\nthey concluded to return. When ready to return they found that their\r\ndonkey had strayed away and upon searching for him they discovered\r\nhim away upon the side of the mountain perched upon a mass of rock\r\nor croppings of lava, as it appeared to be from a distance, but they\r\nfound to their astonishment and delight that this outcropping upon\r\nwhich their donkey had taken his station was a solid mass of ore of\r\nsome character which they didn’t know the value of until they had it\r\nproperly assayed upon their return home. This mine, first discovered by\r\na donkey, is the Bunker Hill mine, situated near the town of Wardner.\r\n\r\nYank continued by saying that no prospecting can be done up in that\r\ncountry in the winter season, owing to the intense cold and great depth\r\nof snow, but there is no difficulty whatever in working a mine and of\r\nshipping ore at any time, as a railroad is running convenient to the\r\ngreat majority of the mines. One remarkable phenomenon I noticed in\r\nthat region was the absence of wind storms. The wind blows but seldom,\r\nand the snow falls in large flakes right straight down, and remains\r\nwhere it falls until the coming of the warm air current from the\r\nPacific Ocean, called, in this region, the Chenook, and the influence\r\nof which is felt for some distance beyond the Rocky Mountains in this\r\nlatitude.\r\n\r\nBy the way, passing through the Cœur d’Alene mining region the remains\r\nof an old road can be seen that was built by the Government some time\r\nin ’61 or ’62 for the purpose of opening a communication for the\r\ntransportation of troops and stores between the Pacific Coast and the\r\nEast. This road was built from Walla-Walla, in Washington Territory,\r\nto Fort Benton, Montana. Many of the old bridges, or rather the ruins\r\nof them, can yet be seen, and are very numerous, for upon one portion\r\nof the Cœur d’Alene River, from the town of Wallace to the town of\r\nMullan, a distance of nine miles, the river has to be crossed, I think,\r\nfourteen times. The builder of this road, Mr. John Mullan, is at the\r\npresent time a\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COASTING IN COUER D’ALENE.]\r\n\r\nresident of the city of Washington, D. C., and engaged in the practice\r\nof law.\r\n\r\nAnother phenomenon I noticed here was the new style of coasting (at\r\nleast to me) practiced by the girls and boys during the moonlight\r\nevenings, their sleds consisting simply of deer skins. These would\r\nbe spread out upon the snow with the hair side down. At the starting\r\npoint, at the top of a steep hill, sitting down upon the skin, the\r\nsides and ends would be drawn up as snug as possible, and when a number\r\nwere ready the signal would be given, and being assisted in the start\r\nby the boys, away they go without regard to order or method. The fun\r\nin this style of coasting does not consist so much in seeing who will\r\nreach the foot of the hill first, but if they can descend and retain\r\ntheir sitting posture, which is almost impossible, for the contact with\r\neach other in their descent causes them to roll over and over, for the\r\nhands are occupied in holding fast the ends of the deer skins, and to\r\nroll is easy. Of course the scene at the foot of the hill, where the\r\nboys and girls all finally meet upon one common level, and badly mixed,\r\nis where the fun comes in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n THEIR NAMES UNKNOWN--THE TYPES OF MEN IN THE MINES--PIKE’S\r\n ILLUSTRATION OF MISSOURI CHARACTER--BOB THE FIDDLER--THE POWER OF\r\n MUSIC ILLUSTRATED--JOHN KELLEY THE MUSICIAN--JOE BOWERS--JEFF VISITS\r\n PIONEER HALL--OLD MINERS IN SAN FRANCISCO.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring a lull in the conversation about this time, it was mentioned by\r\nan old miner as a singular circumstance, that although the old-timers\r\npresent had been acquainted with each other for nearly forty years, he\r\nwould bet his old blind mule, that was hitched to the fence outside,\r\n“agin a chew of tobacco,” they couldn’t tell the names of one another,\r\nwhich was found upon trial to be the case.\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” said Yank, “in old times we didn’t ask the name of a\r\nman; but whar are you from was the main question, the information to\r\nbe desired, and many had become so accustomed to satisfying their\r\ncuriosity upon this point that in course of time it was possible to\r\ntell with some certainty what State a man was from by his general\r\nappearance. For in those early times, when the various States were more\r\nthinly settled than at present, the individuals of each State possessed\r\nsome peculiarity of form, feature, or, their pronunciation of certain\r\nwords, by which they could be distinguished, that is, by any one who\r\ntook the trouble to study the differences between them. For instance,\r\nan acquaintance of mine in early days who had from curiosity studied\r\nthe peculiarities of the emigrants from the various States, said that\r\nhe could tell, as soon as he laid his eyes upon a new comer, what State\r\nthe latter was from.\r\n\r\n“There” said he, “do you see them chaps a-digging that tail race by\r\nthe foot of the hill? Well, they are from away down East, the State of\r\nMaine. See, they are large, heavy framed, tall and awkward in their\r\nmovements, and when they walk their long arms swing about like the arms\r\nof a windmill. Notice how angular their bodies are. That is caused\r\nby friction in circulating about among the granite boulders of their\r\nnative State. The Vermonters are tall, like their neighbors, but of\r\nbetter build. Now down yonder beyond the bridge you notice a number of\r\nmen at work. Well that first gang is from Massachusetts, and the gang\r\nbelow them comes from Connecticut. Now, you see, although they are all\r\nNew Englanders, yet they differ very much from the boys of Maine. They\r\nare, as a general rule, of shorter stature, with short arms, and more\r\ncompactly built. But although the boys from the New England States\r\ndiffer very much in their general appearance, yet there is one trait\r\npeculiar to them, by which, as a general rule they can be distinguished\r\nfrom the boys of many of the other States, I mean of course here in\r\nthe mining regions, and that is they are industrious, and are little\r\ninclined to waste their time in loafing around among the saloons and\r\ngambling houses.\r\n\r\n“There, do you see them boys over there upon the other side of the\r\ncreek. Now, they are from Ohio. There is no mistaking their native\r\nState, for they have all that peculiar look, form and build.\r\n\r\n“They are, as a rule, above the medium in height; heavy built, broad\r\nshouldered, but bones small and compact, with full faces and almost\r\nalways with a round head and nose of the snub order.\r\n\r\n“Like the New England boys, they are generally industrious and do not\r\nfool away much time around among the liquor shops. Now do you see\r\nthose chaps over there by the mill. Well, their State is near Ohio,\r\nyet they are a different class of people. The difference is that when\r\nyou run afoul of a man of that appearance, you can just bet he is from\r\nthe State of Illinois. You see that the most of them have strait sandy\r\nhair, with whiskers to match, sharp features, and as a general rule\r\nwear freckles upon their countenances; but then they are industrious,\r\nand good natured. And now” said he, “where do you suppose those boys\r\nare from, who are building the log cabin on the point below there? Do\r\nyou notice their sharp features, coarse, strait black hair and that\r\nthey are slim built and round shouldered too? Well, them chaps are from\r\nNew Jersey. Now just observe the difference between them and the two\r\nchaps coming up the trail beyond with their mining tools upon their\r\nshoulders. Now, there is a type of man different in many respects from\r\nall others who come into the mining regions. You notice that they are\r\ntall, but heavy built, and walk erect like soldiers on parade. They\r\nhave sandy hair; ’tis rather long and you notice that ’tis inclined to\r\ncurl, with chin whiskers and mustache to match. You notice also that\r\nthey wear a pleasant smile, an indication that they are good natured,\r\nand so they are; but if a chap for any reason sees fit to intimate to\r\none of them that he is a prevaricator, he must break the news to him\r\ngently, in a kind of a quiet subdued sort of style, from a distance, or\r\nfrom the opposite side of a big stump, for the application of the term\r\n‘liar’ to one of that breed of men, will cause a monstrous bowie-knife\r\nto fly from his boot leg, and woe to the man it is aimed at.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” interrupted Tennessee, “that reminds me of a Dutchman up on Bear\r\nriver, in ’50, who had some trouble with one of those chaps about a\r\nmining claim, and he said to one of them ‘you vas told von big lie.’ As\r\nthe Dutchman saw him reach down for his bowie knife, he started to run,\r\nbut the knife was too quick for him, and the heavy ivory handle struck\r\nhim alongside of his head and knocked him down. He saw the flash of the\r\nsun upon the polished blade as it came towards him, and when he became\r\nconscious, some one asked what was the matter?\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, mine gracious,’ he answered; ‘some big flash of dose lightnings\r\nshust comes after mit me, und I dinks dot I vas dunder struck.’\r\n\r\n“Well those boys are from Mississippi. But few of them however, ever\r\ncame into the mining regions. They were generous and free hearted, and\r\na fair specimen of American character from that portion of the country.”\r\n\r\nYank resumed by saying that although ’twas often difficult to tell with\r\ncertainty what State a man was from by his general appearance, yet a\r\nNorthern man could almost always be distinguished from one who was of\r\nSouthern birth.\r\n\r\n“To illustrate” continued he, “my old pard said, There do you see\r\nthe boys standing there in front of the cabin? They are rather tall,\r\nstrait, with short black hair, their complexion rather dark, and you\r\nnotice that they have no beards; the cheek bones are high too. Now,\r\nthose boys are from the Blue Grass regions of Kentucky; full of fun,\r\nand would rather climb around among the mountains and cañons, with\r\ntheir heavy rifles on their shoulders, than to work at mining in the\r\nhot sun.”\r\n\r\nIt being evident now that Yank had concluded his explanation of the\r\nvarious types of men found in the mining region in early days, old\r\nPike arose to his feet and demanded to know if he meant to insult his\r\nnative State by passing over it and not noticing it at all.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said he, “haint we got no keracter at all down thar?”\r\n\r\nYank answered him that as he was present to speak for his own State he\r\nought to do so, and they would listen to him.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Pike, “there was a right smart chance of our boys from\r\nold Missouri thet come out inter Californy long in ’50, an’ I tell\r\nye, boys, thet dern my buttons if I jest wern’t ashamed of some on\r\n’em myself. But them Pike County chaps was from the frontier, yer\r\nknow, and of course er couldn’t expect anything better. But when yer\r\ncome to talk about Missouri keracter in general, boys, an’ of them\r\nold-fashioned forty-year ago chaps, ther real stub an’ twist style of\r\nMissouri gentlemen, why, if yer jest mix together every good pint that\r\nyer can find in all ther rest on ’em from ther t’other States, bile\r\n’em all down in a big kittle, an’ when ‘its cooled down a spell take\r\noff the kiver, an’ yer’ll find in the bottom on it one of yer rale\r\nold-fashioned Missouri gentlemen, cooked clean through, too, you bet.\r\nThar wern’t no marrer in ther backbones nuther, cause they was chuck\r\nfull ’er sand, an’ ther wern’t no room for marrer, and they didn’t\r\nhev no superiors any whar. Now, thet’t my opinion of them chaps in\r\nMissouri. What’s yer opinion, pard?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well,” replied Yank, “if we take you for a sample, Pike, maybe you\r\nare not far out of the way.”\r\n\r\nYank asked Jersey if he had ever, during his travels around the\r\ncountry, come across one of his old pardners whom they called Bob the\r\nFiddler.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Jersey, “but he went East about fifteen years ago, with\r\nquite a fortune that he made up on the Trinity River. He was a fine\r\nyoung chap, but some of the boys in the company were terribly down on\r\nhim when we first went into the mines in ’49. You see, before we sailed\r\nfrom New York there were ten of us who concluded to form a company\r\nby ourselves and work together, just as a great many others did who\r\ncame around Cape Horn, and who intended to go into the mines. These\r\ncompanies were nearly all broken up upon their arrival in the mines,\r\nbecause it was soon found that there were many lazy ones among them who\r\nwere not willing to do their share of the work. But our company seemed\r\nto get\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “I VAS DUNDER STRUCK.”]\r\n\r\nalong first rate, and every man was willing to do his part of the work\r\nexcept Bob. We worked together as a company, however, for nearly two\r\nyears, until some of the boys concluded to go home again. When we first\r\ncommenced mining we came pretty near breaking up on account of Bob,\r\nbut fortunately we did not, and I’ll explain why we didn’t. You see\r\nwe were working a rich claim in Georgetown cañon in the fall of ’49;\r\n’twas good ounce diggings, and we were all anxious to get out all we\r\ncould before the heavy rains commenced in the winter, but the trouble\r\nwas that Bob wouldn’t do his share of the work, and consequently\r\nthere was a good deal of grumbling, and four or five of the boys were\r\ndetermined not to divide with him a share of our week’s work upon the\r\nSaturday night following, and declared that if he was paid a share of\r\nit they would quit and break up the company. Now. Bob was a first rate\r\nfellow, good natured and always full of his jokes and fun; was always\r\nready and willing to run errands or work about the cabin, but he was\r\nnot used to hard work and would only work in the mine a few hours each\r\nday. But Bob was a good fiddler and singer, and I tell you, boys, after\r\nthe day’s work was done we liked to hear him start in on his music.\r\nWell, fiddle-strings were a scarce article up in the mines then, and\r\nsome of Bob’s strings breaking we had to get along without music for\r\nawhile; but one Saturday Bob heard of a man who worked in a cañon a\r\nfew miles above, and who had just come up from San Francisco, bringing\r\nan assortment of fiddle-strings with him. This was good news for Bob,\r\nso he threw down his pick and shovel about ten o’clock A.M. and made\r\ntracks for the cañon.\r\n\r\n“It was then that the dissatisfied ones determined that Bob should\r\neither leave the company or they would, for they had made up their\r\nminds not to work any more for a man who wouldn’t do his share.\r\n\r\n“The balance of us, however, thought too much of Bob to have him turned\r\nout of the company, and agreed if they would overlook Bob’s faults\r\nthat we would work a little harder to make up for his delinquency. We\r\nwere thus engaged in talking and endeavoring to arrange the difficulty\r\nalong in the afternoon, when we heard the sound of Bob’s violin up on\r\nthe hill above. Upon looking up we saw him seated upon a log under the\r\nshade of an oak. We all stopped work and seated ourselves upon the most\r\nconvenient places\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOB, THE FIDDLER.]\r\n\r\nto listen to the music, and for more than two hours we sat there\r\nlistening to the old familiar tunes, played and sung by Bob, of ‘Auld\r\nLang Syne,’ ‘Sweet Home,’ ‘Ben Bolt,’ ‘Do They Miss Me at Home,’ ‘The\r\nOld Folks at Home,’ as well as other songs that we had often heard\r\namong our friends and acquaintances at home. Well, the effect of this\r\nwas that upon making a division at night Bob received his full share.\r\nNot a word of complaint was made against him by anyone then or ever\r\nafterwards, and he was given to understand that if he would, after the\r\nday’s work was done and we had lighted our pipes for the evening smoke,\r\nmake our lonely evenings more cheerful by playing the old familiar\r\nairs, that he could jest work when or as little as he pleased on the\r\nclaim.”\r\n\r\nAt this point an old-timer, who previous to this had been silent,\r\nremarked that but few persons are aware of the wonderful power of\r\nmusic, and its effect upon the mind under certain conditions. But of\r\ncourse we do not realize its magic influence except when placed as we\r\nwere in early days so far from home and living, as you might say, in\r\na semi-civilized condition among the mountains of a new country, that\r\nthese old familiar songs that we heard in our younger days seem to\r\nstrike with full force, and awaken memories that have lain dormant for\r\nmany years perhaps.\r\n\r\n“I remember a little incident,” he continued, “that occurred in early\r\ndays in a small mining camp upon Murderer’s Bar on the Middle Fork of\r\nthe American River, which illustrates this wonderful power of music.\r\n\r\n“A young man from one of the Southern States was mining upon the bar.\r\nHe had a good paying claim, but he got to drinking and spent most of\r\nhis time loafing around among the saloons, and in a few months he\r\ngot down about as low as ’twas possible for a man to get. He was in\r\none of the gambling saloons one evening in company with two or three\r\nothers who were about as low and degraded as he was, sitting at a table\r\nengaged in their usual game of poker, when all at once he arose to his\r\nfeet and stood attentively listening to the music, a song that was\r\nbeing sung, and played on a violin, at the other end of the room. At\r\nthe conclusion of the song he threw his cards upon the floor, and said\r\nthat he had played his last card and drank his last drink, for that\r\nsong that John Kelly had just sung had brought him to his senses, for\r\n’twas the last piece he heard his sister sing when he left home a few\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POWER OF MUSIC.]\r\n\r\n“‘And, boys,’ said he, ‘from this time forward I lead a different\r\nlife.’”\r\n\r\nIt was remarked by another that this same John Kelly was yet living, he\r\nbelieved.\r\n\r\nHe was a good musician as well as singer, and in early days played\r\naround in all the various mining camps.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said Jeff, “I have known miners who had worked hard all day to\r\ntramp several miles into camp through mud and rain to hear Kelly play\r\nand sing some favorite song that their sisters, or some other fellow’s\r\nsister, had been accustomed to sing a few years before away at the\r\nother side of the continent.”\r\n\r\nSome one asked old Pike if he had forgotten the song entitled “Joe\r\nBowers” that he used to sing to the boys in Georgetown cañon in early\r\ndays. He replied that he hadn’t sung it for many long years, but if\r\nthey desired to hear it he would sing it. The desire being unanimous,\r\nhe seated himself upon the table, and in a clear voice sang the old and\r\nlong-forgotten ballad, and as it may be new to many and will recall to\r\nold-timers the scenes and incidents of early days, I give the words for\r\ntheir benefit:\r\n\r\n\r\n                  JOE BOWERS.\r\n\r\n    My name it is Joe Bowers. I’ve got a brother Ike;\r\n    I came from old Missouri, yes, all the way from Pike.\r\n    I’ll tell you why I left thar, and how I came to roam,\r\n    And leave my poor old mammy so fur away from home.\r\n\r\n    I used to court a girl thar, her name was Sally Black,\r\n    I axed her if she’d marry me, she said it was a whack;\r\n    But then says she, “Joe Bowers, before we hitch for life.\r\n    You ought to git a little home to keep yer little wife.”\r\n\r\n    Oh, Sally, dearest Sally! oh, Sally, for your sake,\r\n    I’ll go to California and try to raise a stake.\r\n    Says she to me, “Joe Bowers, you are the man to win,\r\n    Here’s a kiss to bind the bargain,” and she hove a dozen in.\r\n\r\n    When I got to that country I hadn’t “nary red,”\r\n    I had such woolfish feelings I almost wished I was dead;\r\n    But the thoughts of my dear Sally soon made them git,\r\n    And whispered hopes to Bowers--I wish I had ’em yit.\r\n\r\n    Right soon I went to minin’, put in my biggest licks,\r\n    Came down upon the boulders jest like a thousand o’ bricks.\r\n    I worked both late and early, in sun, in rain, in snow,\r\n    I was workin’ for my Sally--’twas all the same to Joe.\r\n\r\n    Bime by I got a letter from my dear brother Ike;\r\n    It came from old Missouri--all the way from Pike;\r\n    It brought to me the derndest news that ever you did hear--\r\n    My heart is almost burstin’, so pray excuse this tear.\r\n\r\n    It said Sal was false to me, her love for me had fled,\r\n    She’d got married to a butcher; the butcher’s head was red,\r\n    And more than than, the letter said--it almost makes me swar--\r\n    That Sally had a baby, and the baby had red har.\r\n\r\n    So now I’ve told you all about this very sad affair,\r\n    ’Bout Sally marryin’ a butcher, a butcher with red har;\r\n    But whether it ’taws a boy or a gal child, the letter never said,\r\n    It only said the baby’s har was “inclined to be red.”\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Some years have passed since Bowers told his very plaintive tale;\r\n    Time smoothed his grief, revived his hopes, his courage did not fail;\r\n    He worked along as best he could, and his dear brother Ike\r\n    Kept Joseph pretty well posted on matters back in Pike.\r\n\r\n    Smallpox it knocked the butcher out, and Joe he wandered home;\r\n    He “played for even” with success, and cares no more to roam;\r\n    Joe married Sally and the shop, he soothed her loving heart,\r\n    And now he has her red-haired son to drive the butcher cart.\r\n\r\n“Oh, by the way, Jeff,” asked one of the boys, “did you visit Pioneer\r\nHall when you was down to the Bay?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, I did,” answered Jeff, “and an acquaintance of mine\r\nhanded in my name for admission as a member of the society.”\r\n\r\n“They say ’tis a fine building, Jeff.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is, and it is the headquarters for the old boys to meet and\r\ntalk over old times.”\r\n\r\n“Well, are there many old miners among them?” asks another.\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t think there are, boys. I saw a great many of the old\r\npioneers around, but none of them looked as though they ever roughed it\r\nmuch in the mines.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well,” said Jersey, “living down there you know, sporting store\r\nclothes and such things, of course, would make the old miners appear\r\nmore like gentlemen, you know, in a little while.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” remarked Pike, “and maybe when we go down thar, boys, and\r\nput on ther biled shirt and tother fixins, why they’ll take us for\r\ngentlemen, too. You bet they will.”\r\n\r\n“One sight I saw there,” remarked Jeff, “which astonished me very\r\nmuch, was the children of the pioneers. They held a fandango there in\r\nthe hall upon the evening of admission day, and from curiosity I just\r\ndropped in for a few minutes to see the little folks enjoy themselves.\r\nChildren! well, boys, you would be astonished to see them, for instead\r\nof a lot of little children, as I expected to see, why the most of them\r\nwere men and women and married, too, many of them; just think of it,\r\nfor it is only a short time ago, apparently, that we all landed here as\r\nmere boys. It shows how old Father Time is hustling us along, whilst we\r\nare tramping about among the hills, thinking all the time that we are\r\njust keeping a little ahead of him. But, boys, we ain’t though.\r\n\r\n“As soon as I laid my eyes on that crowd of young, second-crop\r\nForty-niners, says I, ‘Jeff, old Time is close after you,’ and I have\r\nfelt ever since just like one of them ancient fossils that they have in\r\nthe museums.”\r\n\r\nOne of the boys enquired if he saw many of the boys down there whom we\r\nused to know around in the mines.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he answered, “I reckon I did. Why, San Francisco is chock full\r\nof ’em.”\r\n\r\n“What are they doing?” “Well, now, I couldn’t answer that question.\r\nSome of them are doing one thing and some another, and doing all kinds\r\nof things and odd jobs to make a livin’; but I tell you ’tis hard work\r\nfor some of ’em. You know how we often wondered what had become of lots\r\nof them chaps that we mined with up in old Hangtown, Forest Hill, and\r\nother diggin’s. Well, there they all are, or the most of them. When the\r\nmines give out, or they got tired of prospecting, they just put for\r\nthe big city to strike a job of some kind, and I tell you, I kinder\r\npitied some of ’em. They have such a woebegone and old-fashioned,\r\none-hundred-years-ago kind of look about ’em, hanging round the\r\nwharves, anywhere, looking for a job. I tried to get some of ’em to\r\ncome along up here with me, and offered to pay their expenses up. Told\r\n’em there was lots of places where they could pan out or cradle a\r\nfirst-rate livin’, and told ’em, too, how they could jest fence in a\r\nfew acres of ground, set out some fruit trees, make a good garden, and\r\nlive like lords. But they reckoned ’twas too far off and they couldn’t\r\nget back to spend their evenings in town with the boys.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEFF IN THE HALL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n PIONEER HALL--OLD MIKE EXPLAINS--SOMETHING WRONG--THE BUSINESS OF\r\n MINING--MIKE’S PHILOSOPHY--YANK AT THE BAY--THE EXPRESSMAN AND THE\r\n BROOM PEDDLER--LUCKY BILL AND THE GAMBLERS--SAM PLUNKET, THE ARKANSAS\r\n BEAUTY--PETE, THE BOSS LIAR OF THE YUBA.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany questions were asked in relation to the new Pioneer hall. Jeff\r\nexplained that it was on Fourth street near the corner of Market; that\r\nit contained a large hall, used for meetings, lectures, festivals\r\nand other purposes, as well as for dancing by the young Pioneers. “I\r\nattended one of their dances and I noticed that some of the old boys\r\nthemselves could just get around as lively as any of ’em.\r\n\r\n“Then there is the ladies’ parlor, which is grand I tell you, with\r\nits velvet sofas, divanzes and everything. There ain’t nothing around\r\nhere in the mines that can compare with it. Then up-stairs is a fine\r\nbilliard room, where I saw some of the old boys amusing themselves,\r\nand I noticed that the most of ’em who played, were sure to get left\r\nevery time, jest as many of us used to in mining. ’Tis the same old\r\ngame, clear through. (You bet ’tis, was the general response.) There\r\nis also a big smoking-room, and here were a number of the old boys\r\namusing themselves by playing checkers, dominoes and cards, and they\r\nall looked a kinder happy and contended, with a sort of a ‘well, now\r\nwe have struck it’ kind of a look about ’em. Oh, by the way, there was\r\na large reading-room, too, containing several long tables which were\r\nall covered with books and newspapers. And there were a number of old\r\nboys sitting around in just the biggest kind of rocking chairs that you\r\never did see. Some were reading, and some were asleep and just dreaming\r\nabout their old mining days.” Some one asked how many of the boys were\r\nthere now in the society, who were living, and how many had joined\r\nsince its organization in ’50?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIONEER HALL.]\r\n\r\nHe explained that Mr. Graves, the Secretary, informed him that the\r\nwhole number who had joined the society was about 3,350, and of this\r\nnumber there were now living about 1,300.\r\n\r\n“Well, Jeff, did you make out to find the old ship once more that\r\nbrought you to California?”\r\n\r\n“No, boys, but I found the great building that was built over her hull\r\non Sansome street, but the hull of the old ship is buried deep below\r\nthe mud and water out of sight entirely, and all that remains now of\r\nthe old ship is the name, the ‘Niantic.’”\r\n\r\nAfter Jeff had concluded, an old-timer remarked that it was a great\r\npleasure to him to hear that so many of the old-timers were yet living,\r\nand said he:\r\n\r\n“I wish there was some way of finding out how many of the old-timers\r\nare yet living, and what part of the world they are in.”\r\n\r\n“Faith thin,” replied Mike, “indade an’ ’twud be er foine thing if we\r\nwer afther knowin’ thet same. An’ if we wer afther knowin’ of ther b’ys\r\nwho are above the ground at ther prisint toime, thet we sailed with\r\naround ther Horn so many long years since, an’ indade, if we could only\r\nbe afther mateing with some of thim, an talk ov ther ould times and\r\nincidints av ther voyage, an’ ov ther lives ov thim since we landed\r\nupon ther coast, do yez moind, pwhat tales we could be afther relatin’\r\nto aich other, ov evints an’ incidints av a California loife.\r\n\r\n“Pwhat a foine thing ’twould be, now, if some one wud jest be afther\r\ngittin’ ther names ov ther b’ys who are now livin’. ’Twould be a hape\r\nov trouble an’ ixpensive, too, but bedad thin, twould be interestin’ to\r\nall ov us. Now, Yank, yez had better undertake ther job ov gittin’ ther\r\nnames of thim for yez own satisfaction.”\r\n\r\nYank remarked that he had been thinking of doing so, and as soon as he\r\nhad an opportunity he would see what could be done.\r\n\r\nMike again remarked:\r\n\r\n“Well now, me b’ys, ’tis many long years since ther news was afther\r\nbein sint across ther continint that ther was jest slathers av gould\r\nlyin’ around loose here, an’ aisy to git, do yez moind, an’ indade\r\nthin thet’s jest what brought us here too, the lot av us. An’ pwhat a\r\nchange, begorra, has been afther takin’ place since we landed upon the\r\nshores of California, for ’twas thin a wilderness, an’ the Indians, the\r\ngrizzlies an’ a variety ov other strange animiles, were monarchs ov all\r\nthey surveyed, thin, with not a blessed wan to dispute ther title, do\r\nyez moind. But ther discovery ov gold changed all this, do yez see? Fur\r\nnow, where we was afther findin’ a wilderness thin, we see a number ov\r\ntowns an’ cities, an’ in the short space ov toime ov forty years we\r\nnow are afther obsarvin’ an empoire containin’ a million ov paple or\r\nmore, begorra. Doorin’ that space ov toime, too, there has been taken\r\nfrom our gould moines an amount excadin’ a billion and a half dollars,\r\nwhich has been scattered about among ther paple of ther country, do\r\nyez moind. Indade, thin, ’tis thrue enough, be jabers, that ther b’ys\r\nwho was afther diggin’ it from ther sile, recaived a moity small share\r\nov the same for ther labor ov diggin’ it from the hills an’ mountains\r\nabout, for it saimed the whole toime to obsarve the same law as runnin’\r\nwather, do yez moind; an’ as fast as ’twas afther bein’ taken from the\r\nearth, it run in a containious straim down to ther big cities below,\r\nan’ divil a bit could we be afther stoppin’ it, at all, at all.”\r\n\r\nAnother old-timer remarked that although the boys who dug out the gold\r\nretained but a small proportion of it, yet the whole country in general\r\nreceived the full benefit of it.\r\n\r\n“Yis,” Mike replied, “thrue enough that same was the case, an’ do yez\r\ncall to moind, thin, ther wise spaich in ther Bible where it says that\r\nto him who hath much more will be afther being given to that same, and\r\nto him that hath nothin’ at all, at all, they will be afther deproivin’\r\nhim av the same troifling quantity, begorra. Well, me b’ys, that’s jest\r\nthe style av it, for ’tis a law av money now, do yez obsarve, that,\r\n’twill be afther continually concintratin’ into the hands av the b’ys\r\nwho have got the most av it, do yez see? An’, in me own opinion, ’tis\r\njest as well, for they are the b’ys ginerally who know how to use it\r\nfor the benefit av the rest av us, do yez moind. For didn’t Mr. Lick,\r\nthin, use his money in a dacint manner for the benefit av all the b’ys?\r\nAn’ didn’t he give thim a foine Hall down at the big city below, where\r\nthey can howld their matins’ to talk about ould-timers, rade ther\r\npapers, an’ enj’y a quiet nap, begorra! and indade, thin, did not the\r\nsame ould gintleman spind his money frayly in erectin’ an obsarvatory\r\nwith a big tilliscope, do yez moind, to sarch ther hivens with,\r\nexpictin’ the whoile to discover in some av ther planets above anither\r\nrich moining counthry where yez can be afther emigratin’ to whin yez\r\nhave wuorked out this wan? An’, indade, thin, wasn’t it another wan\r\nav ther b’ys who gathered up more than his share afther spindin’ his\r\nkine fraly in the buildin’ av an ixtinsive univarsity, to give our\r\nchildren a bit av larnin’ av a louder style, begorra? Yis, indade thin,\r\nthe construction av foine buildin’s, av big warehouses, ther monstrous\r\nstaim ships, ther great manufactories, and ther railroads all over the\r\ncounthry, as well as ther extinsive canals and ditches, constructed to\r\ngive wather to ther barren places in ther counthry, begorra, is in me\r\nown opinion an evidince that a fair portion ov the gould, at laist,\r\nthat we b’ys helped to dig from the river beds an’ mountains in ther\r\nmoinin’ ragion has collected into ther hands ov the b’ys who are jest\r\nafther knowin’ how to use ther same for the binefit ov all, do yez\r\nmoind.”\r\n\r\nAnother old miner declared that there was something wrong about it;\r\nthat he couldn’t understand at all why so many of the miners who dug\r\nso many millions of gold from the earth should all be so poor now, and\r\nhe believed ’twas owing to the greed and selfishness of the business\r\nclasses. They took all the advantage to rob the miners of their\r\nwell-earned share of the gold.\r\n\r\n“No, not at all,” said Mike; “that, indade, is not the raison, but\r\n’tis all owin’ to ther nater ov the moinin’ industry, an’ that I’ll\r\nbe afther ixplainin’, thin. Do yez obsarve the difference now betwain\r\nthe business ov mining an’ all other koinds; for, indade thin, has not\r\nthe moiner got his rich moin in ther beginnin’, whilst in all other\r\nkoinds it requoires long years to wurruk for it. As a man puts in his\r\ntoime and his money in any business, sure thin is it not incrasin’\r\nin vally continually? An’ so it is with the lawyer, the doctor an’\r\nwith the mechanic too, now, do yez moind. Wan ov the b’ys takes up a\r\npace ov land; spends his toime an’ money in improvin’ that same, and,\r\nbegorra, the longer he works upon it, thin, the more valuable it is\r\nafther growin’ the whoile; but divil a bit is the rich moine growin’ in\r\nvally at all, at all. But do yez moind, thin, the longer yez are afther\r\nwurrukin’ it thin the poorer ’tis growin’, an’ when ’tis wurruked out,\r\ndevil a cint can many of yez show for the toime an’ labor yes have\r\nspint upon the same.”\r\n\r\nAnother one remarked, “Well, ’tis true enough, as you say, that the\r\ngold we dig out flows into the big cities into the hands of a few\r\nwealthy men, and ’tis for that reason that the rich are getting richer\r\nwhilst the poor are gittin’ poorer.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” says Mike, “now yez are afther encrouching upon a question\r\nin political economy that we ould miners are hardly competint to dale\r\nwith, begorra. But in me own opinion ’tis not thrue, as yez have\r\nstated, that the rich are afther gittin’ richer, whoile the poor are\r\ngittin’ poorer, at all, at all. It only saims to be the case, but not\r\nso in fact, as oi will explain to yez. ’Tis thrue enough, that in\r\nconsequince ov the large quantity ov gould yez b’ys have dug from ther\r\nhills above an’ thrown in circulation, the facilities ov scrapin’ large\r\nquantities ov it in a hape by a few ov the b’ys in the big cities was\r\nan aisy job, an’ by use ov the same, in a few years they were very rich\r\nmen. An’ if all the b’ys who were fortunate enough to do that same\r\ncould continue to live in the same manner, and ther children afther\r\nthim, to inherit such conditions ov great wealth, why, then, ’twould\r\nbe thrue as yez hav sthated. But divil a bit is that the case. But why\r\nnot, are yez asking?\r\n\r\n“Well, thin, jist be afther lookin’ back for a few years an’ callin’\r\nto yez recollection ther b’ys who were wealthy thin, and where do yez\r\nfoind thim or ther descindents now? An’, indade, thin, couldn’t yez\r\nspake ov many ov the b’ys who were ther poorest ov the lot a few years\r\nago, an’ are now the richest ov thim? An’ don’t that prove to yez that\r\nchanges are afther takin’ place containualy? The poor ov to-day may\r\nbe the wealthy b’ys ov next wake, an’ the sons ov the b’ys who are\r\nnow rejicin’ over ther good fortunes may be the b’ys who’ll hav the\r\nhard wurruk to do in ther future, do yez moind. An’, agin, me b’ys,\r\nas obsarvation shows us, more than noine-tinths ov the wealthy b’ys\r\nto-day were poor, or the sons ov poor wurrukin’ min wanst, which is an\r\nividince that the opportunities for scrapin’ togither a hape ov wealth\r\nis not confoined to any won class ov min, at all, at all; but ivery\r\ndivil a won ov yez has an aiqual opportunity wid all if yez only go\r\nther right way to wurruk to git it, be jabers.\r\n\r\n“Now, these changes prove that altho’ at wan pariod in the lives ov\r\nthe wealthy b’ys they do increase in wealth, but yez’ll foind in toime\r\nthat noine-tinths ov thim grow poorer as they grow older, which is not\r\nthe case with the whiskey yez are afther drinking, thin, for that is\r\nimprovin’ the whoile. And yez’ll be after observin’, too, that ther\r\nranks ov the wealthy b’ys are bein’ containualy recruited from the\r\nranks ov the workin’ min ov the counthry, be jabers. ’Tis for these\r\nraisons, me b’ys, acquoired by long exparience an’ observation, that\r\ndivil a bit are ther rich gitting richer or ther poor poorer, at all,\r\nat all. Oh, yis, ’tis thrue enough thet it saims to be the case thet\r\nthe gould ov the counthry is being gobbled up by a few ov the b’ys, but\r\ndivil a bit is it thrue in fact, for to make money yez must use the\r\nsaime, an’ for that raison ’tis ividint that the circulation ov money\r\nis constant an’ aiqual, an’ all ov yez hav aiqual opportunities for\r\nusin’ that saime, begorra!”\r\n\r\nMike was now asked if he didn’t think that it would be better for the\r\ncountry in general, or for the working classes in particular, if this\r\nco-operative plan that we have heard so much about lately should be\r\nadopted:\r\n\r\nMike answered:\r\n\r\n“No, indade, thin, it would not, and for the raisins, me b’ys, that if\r\nyez will only investigate ther incentives--that is the ground wurruk\r\nov all human action--yez will be afther foindin’ that all depinds upon\r\nour future ixpictations. Now, me by’s, what is it that kape ther lot ov\r\nyez er thrampin’ around among ther hills and the mountains from Arizoni\r\nto Alasky, thin, but ther containual ixpictation of sthrikin’ er rich\r\nmine? An’, indade, thin, is it not thrue ov all other human affairs,\r\nbegorra? What, thin, me b’ys, becomes ov all ixpictations when yez hav\r\nall jined with the co-operative union, be jabers? Indade, thin, yez can\r\nhav none at all, for yez are all shure of a livin’ an’ nothin’ more\r\nto ixpict, an’ all ov yez are livin’ upon an aquality. Yis, indade,\r\nthin, jist ask the workin’ min ov the counthry if they wud be contint\r\nto live in such a style, whin they wud all be afther bein’ shure ov er\r\nlivin’, shure enough, but wid no ixpictations that aither thimselves\r\nor ther children wud iver be inythin’ higher than workin’ min. An’, be\r\njabers, thin, they wud be afther sayin’ to yez: ‘Give us poverty, thin,\r\nan’ hard wurruk, but divil a bit shall yez be afther deprivin’ us ov\r\nther containual ixpictations we hav that our b’ys may be in ther future\r\nable to live like gintlemin widout ther necessity ov labor, at all, at\r\nall.’ An’, faith, thin, do yez moind ther lad who was afther robbin’\r\nther melon patch, but accidentilly got among ther punkins, an’ whin\r\ntould thet the owner ov ther melons wud give him all he wanted for the\r\naskin’, said he: ‘Indade, thin, its meself, thin, who had rather ait a\r\ngrane punkin that I could stale than to ate a foine melon presented to\r\nme.’\r\n\r\n“Tis thrue enough,” continued Mike, “that the poor saims to be\r\ncontinually incrasing in numbers in all ther large cities ov ther\r\ncountry, begorra! but ther raisons fur this are that the inducements\r\nare greater there, an’ to the minds ov the b’ys the prospects ov\r\ngittin’ money much quicker an’ aisier saim more encouraging to thim,\r\ndo yez moind; but in me own opinion ’twould be better for ther most ov\r\nthim to come out into ther counthry an’ try to make an honest living\r\nfrom ther sile; that would aqualize ther labor ov ther counthry,\r\nbegorra, an’ tind to solve ther labor problem, begob!”\r\n\r\nMike was now asked the question, what method could be adopted that\r\nwould have the effect to bring all classes more upon an equality?\r\n“None at all,” Mike answered, “Divil a bit is it necessary to do that\r\nsaim for I tell yez, me b’ys, that poverty, which saims to the most\r\nov yez to be a curse put upon man for his sins, is in fact ther base\r\nan’ foundation ov all human enterprise, industry, and prosperity; now\r\nwas it not poverty, with a desire to escape from it, that brought\r\nthousands ov yez old pioneers here to dig an’ thramp about among ther\r\nmountains for gould? indade, thin, it was, for if yez hadn’t been poor,\r\ndivil a bit would one ov yez come at all, at all. An’ indade, thin,\r\nwas it not in consequence ov this same poverty (that many ov the b’ys\r\nall over ther counthry are howling and cursing about,) that has been\r\nther mains ov ilivating ther whole counthry to such high conditions\r\nov development, shure, and it is thin, an’ ther prosperous condition\r\nov ther counthry to day with its great commarcial enterprises, its\r\nrailroads runnin’ in all directions from ther Atlantic to ther Pacific\r\nOceans, an’ with its mariads ov growing towns and cities springing\r\ninto existence among ther desert places, where but a few years since\r\nwas a vast wilderness occupied only by ther buffalo droves, and savage\r\nIndians; all ov these wonderful changes, me b’ys, are only ther effects\r\nov poverty, be jabers. It must be plain to yez, thin, that poverty is a\r\nnecessity, an’ ther incintive to escape from it is ther bottom of ther\r\nwhole business, begorra!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that may all be very true” remarked another, “but when we take\r\na view of life around us and witness the great amount of misery and\r\nsuffering in all of our large cities, while a great portion of the\r\nmore fortunate are rolling in wealth, don’t you think that it would be\r\njust and right to adopt some policy that would prevent such extreme\r\nconditions of great wealth of a few and the poverty of the many?”\r\n\r\n“Faith thin” says Mike “an’ ’tis this same idea upon which is founded\r\nall ov thim isms that are after creating so much excitement among ther\r\nworkingmen ov ther counthry, begorra; it makes thim discontinted with\r\ntheir conditions for ther raisons that ther laiders ov socialism, ov\r\nGeorgeism, anti-povertyism, nationalism an’ ther rest ov thim, are all\r\nthe toime taiching the b’ys that ther only raisons why they are so poor\r\nis because others ov thim are so wealthy, begorra, and if their ideas\r\nin relation to human affairs can only be carried out by previnting\r\nthem b’ys from incraising their wealth who are, owing to their good\r\nhabits and suparior abilities, the best able to do so, be jabers, will\r\nin their opinion give ther poor b’ys a better opportunity to incraise\r\ntheir wealth whether they are capable ov doing so or not; now, me b’ys,\r\nis this a raisonable view ov the situation, for aint you b’ys who are\r\njest afther putting in your toime thramping ’round among the mountains\r\nfor a rich mine, begorra, more loikely to foind it than ther b’ys who\r\nare all ther whoile contint to hang around in the cities, thin, huntin’\r\nfor an aisy job, and who are containually howling for yez to prisint\r\nthim with an interest in yez mine, be jabers. Yis, m’ b’ys, observation\r\nis afther taichin’ us ther fact that as a gineral rule thim b’ys who\r\nare industrious thin, an’ who are afther acquiring good habits only,\r\nare ther b’ys who are prosperous and, faith thin, in me own opinion\r\nthey desarve it, too.\r\n\r\n“Now for these raisons, me b’ys, it is in me own opinion all darmed\r\nnonsinse to talk about anti-poverty an’ an aiquality of conditions, for\r\nwe don’t want thim at all, at all.”\r\n\r\nYank next related his experience at the Bay. When he was down last\r\nspring an acquaintance persuaded him to attend a reunion of the Old\r\nHangtown residents, or rather the old-timers of Eldorado County. Yank\r\nexplained that the residents of Tuolumne, Nevada and Eldorado Counties\r\nhold what they call a reunion every year, generally about May 1. They\r\nhave them in Oakland at one of the numerous parks; generally; but\r\nsometimes at other localities. He said that the one he attended was in\r\nBadger’s Park, and there were as many as 1,500 people there. But among\r\nall that crowd there was only one old Forty-niner whom he knew before,\r\nalthough it was said that there were several others around on the\r\nground somewhere.\r\n\r\n“I tell you” said he, “there were lots of people there whom I used to\r\nknow around old Hangtown in ’51 and ’52, and they all seemed kind of\r\nglad to meet one another. Then there was a whole\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOST.]\r\n\r\nregiment of youngsters and girls dancing in the hall, but they were all\r\nbabies when I left the diggings, so I didn’t know a single one of them.\r\nThey hold these meetings down there every year, and, boys, blamed if I\r\nwon’t try and go down every time if I can make a raise, for I tell you\r\nit sets a fellow up again to meet all of these old-timers, and to have\r\na chat about old times.\r\n\r\n“I came across an old acquaintance very unexpectedly down there whom I\r\nthought was dead, and by consent of my old pard, Tennessee, I’ll tell\r\nthe whole story. You remember, boys, that in ’52 an old miner in Shasta\r\nCounty discovered somewhere in the mountains a very rich cañon; he\r\nwas afterwards killed by the Indians. Many expeditions went in search\r\nof the lost cañon but none could ever find it. In the spring of ’54 a\r\ncompany, consisting of Tennessee, five others, and myself, concluded\r\nto go in search of it, but, unfortunately, we started a little too\r\nearly in the spring, for on the fourth day out there came on a terrible\r\ncold snow-storm, and of course we started home again. We got lost and\r\nwandered about for three or four days, not knowing what course to\r\ntake, and, worse than all, we were nearly out of provisions. There\r\nwas a young Swede with us. He was a sailor chap who had come from San\r\nFrancisco to try his fortune in mining, and, being anxious to go with\r\nus, we had brought him along. He was a smart, good-natured boy, and we\r\nall thought a heap of him. Well, in the evening, we were all lounging\r\naround the fire, talking over the situation, when one of the boys, just\r\nfor sport, proposed that we now right there and then cast lots to see\r\nwhich one of us must be cut up to save the lives of the rest, as we\r\nonly had grub enough to last about one day longer. Of course the boy\r\nwas elected, as we intended, just to see if ’twould scare him any; but\r\nhe didn’t seem to mind it at all, for he laughed and joked about it,\r\nwhen we had all decided to have him for breakfast in the morning.\r\n\r\n“The sun rose clear the next morning, but we were astonished to find\r\nupon getting up that Pete, the sailor boy, had vanished. He had become\r\nfrightened, believing that we were in earnest, and had started off\r\nalone through the snowdrifts, only to get lost and perhaps destroyed by\r\nbears. We determined to find him if t’was possible, so without stopping\r\nto make a fire we ate a cold breakfast and were soon following his\r\ntrail, which we were enabled to trace easily for about twenty miles to\r\nthe bottom of a deep cañon. From that point, however, all traces of\r\nit were lost. We returned home, determined to continue the search as\r\nsoon as possible. In a day or two we procured mules and searched among\r\nthe hills and cañons thoroughly in all directions for several days, but\r\nnothing was ever heard of him, it being the conclusion of all that he\r\nhad been destroyed by a grizzly, which were very numerous at that time.\r\nWell, I came across an old mining acquaintance in San Francisco who was\r\nfollowing the sea, and we took a walk down among the vessels. We were\r\nlounging along down one of the wharves and I saw a man on board of a\r\nsmall coasting schooner whom I though had rather a familiar look about\r\nhim. My acquaintance said that he didn’t know his name, but that he was\r\nthe owner of that vessel. I told my friend that I was going to see him,\r\nso I jumped down on to the deck and spoke to the man, asking him if he\r\nwas the captain. He answered that he was, and he wanted to know if I\r\nwas looking for a job. I told him no, but that I had a great curiosity\r\nto see him, as he reminded me very much of a young chap I once knew in\r\nthe mines. He asked me when. Said I: ‘More than thirty years ago, up in\r\nShasta County.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ said he, ‘I was up in that county about that time and got out\r\nof there as quick as I could, as some of the old miners were talking\r\nabout eating me up.’\r\n\r\n“As he said that I just grabbed hold of his hand, and said I:\r\n\r\n“‘This is Pete, the sailor boy, isn’t it?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ he answered, ‘but who are you?’\r\n\r\n“‘Don’t you remember Yank?’ I asked; ‘one of those old miners who were\r\ngoing to make a breakfast off of you?’\r\n\r\n“Well, boys, he did remember me now, you bet.\r\n\r\n“‘Mine gracious, is this Yank? Well! well! now come down into mine\r\ncabin.’\r\n\r\n“After we had both recovered a little from our astonishment, and I had\r\nexplained how we had hunted for him for several days among the hills\r\nand cañons, he told me how he had managed to find his way out of the\r\nmountains, after remaining up in a tree for more than two days to get\r\naway from a big grizzly which he thought must have been some relation\r\nto us old miners, some way, for the brute seemed determined to eat him\r\nup, anyhow.\r\n\r\n“‘But,’ said he, ‘the bear got tired and hungry waiting for me to come\r\ndown and finally went away, and then I came down and made tracks for\r\nSan Francisco pooty quick, and don’t want to go out prospecting any\r\nmore at all.’”\r\n\r\nYank continued by asking if any of them remembered the chap they called\r\n“Razor Bill.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yis,” Mike answered, “indade I remimber him well whin he wurruked\r\ndown near Angel’s camp, an’ whin he wurruked up at Poverty Point, near\r\nHangtown, an’ he made a good dale ov money too, but, begorra, he wasn’t\r\nthe b’y to save it. I see him play cards with that same chap they\r\ncalled ‘Lucky Bill,’ an’ he lost more than $800 at the game.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Yank, “I saw him at the Bay. He is driving an express\r\nwagon, and says that he is doing a very good business. He is married\r\nnow, and has five or six children.”\r\n\r\nTennessee remarked that any man who played the game of seven up with\r\n“Lucky Bill” was sure to leave his dust there, for he was one of the\r\nbest card-players in California.\r\n\r\n“Do you remember the time when he cleaned out them chaps from San\r\nFrancisco?” resumed Tennessee. “‘Twas in August of ’50, soon after his\r\narrival in Hangtown from the East. These two chaps had heard of him,\r\nand that he had plenty of money, and they came up to clean him out.\r\nHis house was crowded that evening by the boys who wanted to see the\r\nfun. It was agreed that one of these ’Frisco chaps should play ten\r\ngames, and then if luck was against him he should have the privilege\r\nof quitting the game if he wished, and the other one could take his\r\nplace and play in the same manner. They brought (as was said) $11,000\r\nwith them, all in $50 slugs, which was piled upon the table, and an\r\nequal sum was placed alongside of Bill. Both piles were decorated in\r\nthe usual manner, with a big revolver placed in a convenient position\r\nfor an emergency. The play was for $1,000 a game, and I tell you ’twas\r\ninteresting to see them piles of slugs travel back and forth in a\r\nrapid manner from one side of the table to the other. But it was soon\r\nnoticed that many of these stacks of slugs that had waltzed across to\r\nLucky Bill’s side didn’t seem to be inclined to waltz back again. The\r\nconsequence was that at the end of two hours they had played thirty-one\r\ngames, and every slug was under the protection of Bill’s gun.\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ says one of the chaps, ‘that ends our game, for you have got\r\nit all.’\r\n\r\n“Bill shoved a stack of slugs over to them, remarking: ‘There, boys,\r\ntake that to pay your expenses.’\r\n\r\n“‘No, no; not a cent,’ one of them replied, ‘it is all yours, for you\r\nhave played a straight, square game, and we will not take a dollar of\r\nit.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “THAT’S THER, THER ’TOTHER ONE.”]\r\n\r\nSome one enquired of Jersey if he knew what ever became of Pete, the\r\nboss liar of the Yuba? as the boys called him; Jersey replied that he\r\nwas killed by a bear up in Plumas County sometime in ’54. Pete and\r\ntwo others were prospecting in a ravine one day, when a big grizzly\r\ncame upon them from the brush; his pardners got away by climbing up\r\na steep hill and went for assistance, but Pete had been caved upon a\r\nshort time before and couldn’t run, so he and the bear had the whole\r\ncircus to themselves for a while; they rescued him but ’twas too late,\r\nhe was torn all to pieces. But he was true to his colors to the last,\r\nfor after they had taken him to his cabin to die, almost his last words\r\nwere, “well boys, I got away with one of ’em any how, and if I’d only\r\nhad a fair show I’d ’er cleaned ’em both out” but when told that there\r\nwas but one bear there, he answered: “Oh, yes, ther was, for didn’t yer\r\nnotice lots or hair and bear’s grease scattered about on ther rocks?”\r\nthe boys said they did. “Well,” says Pete with his dying breath,\r\n“that’s ther, ther tother one.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” continued Jersey, “but Pete was a fine talker and his persuasive\r\neloquence was almost irresistible; he said once that his father was\r\na life-insurance agent down in Connecticut, and that he himself had\r\ninherited a faculty for the business, and intended to follow it when he\r\nreturned East.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAM’S SHADOW AND THE INDIANS.]\r\n\r\nThere was an old Irishman living on the bar at that time by the name\r\nof Pat Flynn. Pete was in his cabin one Sunday morning, and Pat wanted\r\nto trim up his long hair with a large pair of shears, but couldn’t\r\nfind his piece of looking-glass. Pete said that he would go and get\r\nhis own for him, so he went and found a brick, and bet the drinks with\r\none of the boys that he would convince Pat that it was a looking-glass\r\nand that he would use it to cut his hair with. Well, it was hard work,\r\nand it took a good deal of talking to convince Pat, but after looking\r\nit all over, and turning it in his hand, he remarked, “that ’twas a\r\nquare glass but, be jabers, I’ll give it a thry, any how,” and he did;\r\nin a few moments, however, he come near clipping off one of his ears;\r\ngrabbing the brick from the table, as Pete started to run he threw it\r\nat him, at the same time exclaiming, “Pete, yez are a darmed liar.” “I\r\nknow it, thats my trade, Pat” says Pete as he started away, and he won\r\nthe drinks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.]\r\n\r\nSome one asked Bolzer what became of Sam Plunkett, the Arkansas beauty,\r\nas they called him. Bolzer stated that after they had finished working\r\nout their joint claim in Georgetown cañon, in the spring of ’50, Sam\r\nwent north, and was supposed to have been killed by the Modoc Indians\r\nin the summer of ’56, as he went on a prospecting expedition up into\r\nthat country about that time, and was never heard of afterwards.\r\n\r\n“If the Indians did kill him,” Bolzer continued, “they must have done\r\nit when he was asleep some dark night, for they never dared to go near\r\nenough to kill him in the daylight. Why, Sam told me once that he was\r\noffered a big salary to travel with a show as a natural curiosity, and\r\nI asked why he didn’t. Well, he said he would, but there was another\r\nchap in his native State who was jealous of him, and told him if he\r\njoined that show he would kill him later, sure. Sam said they hired\r\n’tother chap, but they didn’t keep him long, for the farmers all over\r\nthe country made such a fuss, and threatened to kill him if he didn’t\r\ngit out. I asked Sam why the farmers were all down on him, and he said\r\nthat in every section of the country he passed through, the milk all\r\nturned sour.\r\n\r\nBolzer then related an incident to show why the Indians were afraid to\r\nget near enough to Sam to kill him.\r\n\r\n“Upon one occasion,” said Bolzer “Sam, in company with a chap they\r\ncalled ‘Sleepy Ben,’ started upon a prospecting expedition away up\r\nnorth, and Ben tells for a fact that when, in passing around a point\r\nnear the mouth of a ravine, they saw, just a short distance beyond,\r\nfour or five Indians who were apparently very badly scared at something\r\nupon the opposite side of the ravine, for they ran for their ponies,\r\nwhich they mounted in a great hurry, and were out of sight among the\r\nrocks and brush beyond in a jiffy. Ben said they were astonished, and\r\ncouldn’t imagine what the Indians were so badly scared at, but, upon\r\ncoming in sight of the opposite side of the ravine, there upon the face\r\nof a high ledge of rock was the shadow of Sam with his roll of blankets\r\nupon his back, looking for all the world like a huge camel walking upon\r\nits hind legs.”\r\n\r\nBolzer was asked if he believed the yarn that was told about Sam\r\nfrightening a bear to death up in Nevada County, in the fall of ’50.\r\nBolzer replied that Dutch Pete, who was with Sam at the time, said\r\n’twas true. Upon some one asking about the circumstances, Bolzer\r\nrelated that Sam and Pete had been into town and were on their way home\r\nagain with a sack of flour and other articles upon their shoulders. Sam\r\nwas in the lead, and just as they were opposite a cluster of bushes a\r\nhuge grizzly bear met them in the trail, and, raising itself upon its\r\nhind legs, laid its forepaws in a playful manner upon Sam’s shoulders.\r\nSam had a heavy load on his back, and being somewhat astonished at the\r\nsudden appearance of the bear he stood perfectly still, and looked\r\nhis unwelcome visitor square in the face. The bear also, by the way,\r\nseemed to be as much astonished as Sam was, and Pete said that it would\r\nlook very earnestly at Sam, first out of one eye and then turning its\r\nhead it would gaze at him for a minute with the other, and then it\r\nwould lower its head, and closing both eyes, seemed to be thinking to\r\nitself whether it had ever in the course of its life come across such\r\na looking object before, and whether ’twas dangerous or not. Pete said\r\nthe animal seemed to think that the queer-looking thing was dangerous,\r\nand that he had “shust got dem paws into it, for he shost rolled his\r\neyes up and pooty sudden all at vunce he falls over on top mit his\r\nback, und den he durns his eye up to Sam, strikes at him mit his paw,\r\nund daking von long breath vas dead right avay as von big nail, by\r\nshiminy.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POWER OF BEAUTY.]\r\n\r\n“This was Pete’s account of the affair,” concluded Bolzer. “Well, Sam\r\nwas the ugliest man in the universe, and he seemed to be proud of it,\r\ntoo. He said once that he would be remembered after he was dead a spell\r\nlonger ‘than you good-lookin’ chaps,’ and that seemed to console him\r\nfor his ugliness. It was stated by a man who crossed the plains in\r\nthe same train with Sam, that the whole train was at one time in the\r\ngreatest danger of being run over and trampled to death by an immense\r\ndrove of buffaloes, but Sam, seeing the danger just in time, walked\r\ntowards the drove when it was almost upon them, and it divided, passing\r\nupon either side. His presence of mind in showing himself to the drove\r\nat the right time saved the lives of more than one hundred men, women\r\nand children.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n BILL BURNES LYNCHING THE COLORED MAN--DICK ARNOLD--THE\r\n MINING REGIONS--THE OLD-TIMERS DISPERSE--THE PHANTOMS OF THE\r\n FORTY-NINERS--FORTY YEARS HAVE PASSED--THE ARGONAUTS’ SOLILOQUY--THE\r\n GREAT CHANGES--THE FLIGHT OF TIME--THE NUMBER OF PIONEERS NOW LIVING.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh, say, Pike, do you remember when Bill Burnes and his crowd of\r\nborder ruffians undertook to hang that colored chap, Bartlett, over on\r\nWeaver Creek in ’51?” asked Tennessee.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yaas, indeed,” answered Pike, “for you know I was right thar and\r\nseen it all.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” Yank continued, “when I was down there to the Bay there was\r\nan article about that affair published in the _Argonaut_. But wasn’t\r\nthat little Providence chap, Dick Arnold, clear grit, though? But,\r\npshaw, who would want to run the risk of his life just to save a darky,\r\nanyhow? You remember that I asked him afterwards how he could run such\r\na risk for a colored man, and a stranger, too.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, well,’ says the little black-eyed cuss, ‘if it had been a yellow\r\ndog I would have done it all the same upon general principles, jest to\r\nshow that crowd that they couldn’t run this country any longer.\r\n\r\n“‘Why, you remember that ’twas this same crowd, the Bill Burnes’\r\ngang, who undertook to make trouble when we voted upon the adoption\r\nof the constitution at Colonel Backus’ hotel; said they didn’t want\r\nany constitution, governor, or law and order, anyhow, out here in\r\nCalifornia, and they gave us to understand that if we Yanks undertook\r\nthat sort of business they would clean us out. At the meeting they\r\ntried to scare us out, but found we didn’t scare worth a cent. So you\r\nsee, boys, when they started in to lynch the darky, Bartlett, me and my\r\npard concluded that they jest shouldn’t do anything of the kind. But,\r\npshaw, we didn’t run so much risk as you think, for we knew that kind\r\nof a crowd. Why, when they see me running over on top of their heads,\r\nwith my knife in between my teeth to cut the rope, they knew right off\r\nthat some of them derned Yanks were around and they had better take\r\nkeer, and they did, too.’”\r\n\r\n“But the best of it was,” said Pike, “to see old Schowton, the sheriff,\r\nand the whole crowd jest go for the brush when Burnes throwed the rope\r\nover the darkey’s head, and then jerked him up into the top of the oak\r\ntree. Yes, and the judge, jury, sheriff and all hands ran a race to see\r\nwho would get into the brush first.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but where were you and Yank all this time?” asked another.\r\n\r\n“Well, I reckon’ we made for the brush, too, and I jest thought there\r\nwas agoin’ to be some shootin’, sure, for there was more than thirty of\r\nthat crowd along with Burnes, but when they seen them two little chaps\r\ncomin’ up the hill agin with the darkey, one on each side of him, with\r\ntheir guns in their hands, they jest wilted.”\r\n\r\n“Do you remember the chap, Joe Hart, who had that rich claim in White\r\nRock cañon, up near Hangtown,” Yank asked. “It was in ’50 that they\r\nsaid he had $60,000 worth of dust salted down at that time. Well,\r\nblamed if I didn’t meet him on Market street, in San Francisco, with a\r\nback-load of brooms. He was peddling brooms, and told me that he could\r\nmake a very good living, that is if he wern’t very particular about how\r\ngood he lived. And one day I was riding in one of the street cars, and\r\nwho in thunder do you s’pose was driving it? Why, old Varmount, as we\r\nused to call the little chap who had such a big claim at Forest Hill\r\nin ’56. He went in some kind of business down thar, and when his money\r\ngave out his business followed suit, and he got a job of car driving\r\nfor a living. I tell you it isn’t any use for an old miner to go down\r\nthere with his dust to go into business among strangers. There are lots\r\nof chaps down there who are just laying for that kind of game. They had\r\nbetter keep their dust up here, and help build up and improve the old\r\nworn-out and deserted mining regions.\r\n\r\n“For I tell you what it is: up here among these old hills is just going\r\nto be the garden spot of California. No finer climate in the world, or\r\nsoil that is any better for raising fruit, grape vines, or kids either.\r\nI just reckon that we old Forty-niners will live to see the time when\r\nall these old hills, flats and ravines where we used to\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DICK ARNOLD RESCUING BARTLETT.]\r\n\r\nmine, which we have tramped over for so many years prospecting, will\r\nall be levelled off, fenced in, and planted with vines and fruit trees.\r\nYes, they will sure; for people are just now coming from the East, and\r\nit won’t be long before you will see railroads running up into all\r\nthese old deserted mining regions, just as there is soon going to be\r\nup into old Hangtown. Just imagine the bell ringing, and the engine\r\nwhistling as it flies up through the ravines among the hills where we\r\nmined in early days. Why, boys, suppose when we were up there to work\r\nforty years ago, some of the boys had said that the time would come,\r\nand we would live to see it, when these hills and flats would be fenced\r\nin, covered with fruit trees and vines, and with nice pleasant homes\r\naround in among them, and that a railroad would be built, and a train\r\nof cars would be seen rolling up into old Hangtown, too. Why, they\r\nwould have been called crazy, and the preachers would have been sent\r\nfor to come and hold an inquest over them.”\r\n\r\nAs it was now getting late in the day, a few of the old miners who had\r\nfruit ranches near by were soon compelled to leave. The five old-timers\r\nwere making preparations to start for other mining localities. Jeff was\r\non his way to Arizona, having heard of the new mines there. Yank was\r\nabout starting for the Yukon. Jersey was headed for the Cœur D’Alene\r\nsilver region, where he was interested in a galena and silver mine,\r\nfrom which he was expecting to realize an immense fortune, whilst\r\nTennessee and Jim had concluded to examine the Kootenai country, in\r\nBritish Columbia. Jeff remarked:\r\n\r\n“Well, now, boys, we are soon to part again, each to go his own way,\r\nbut all determined to continue in the old business of prospecting to\r\nthe end, unless we strike a pile in time to enjoy a few years before we\r\ngo, relief from our labor in quiet and comfort down in the big city by\r\nthe sea.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” says Yank, “and we will continue in this business for all time.\r\nAnd just let the present generation hand it down to their children,\r\nand to their children’s children, as well as to all future generations\r\nwho will make their dwelling places throughout the old mining regions,\r\nthat those phantoms that are occasionally seen wandering about among\r\nthe ravines and cañons in the dead hours of night, carrying upon their\r\nbacks rolls of blankets, as well as an old tin pan, pick and shovel,\r\nare only the restless spirits of a few old miners who are, from force\r\nof habit, hunting for some spot\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WALLACE, IDAHO TERRITORY.\r\n\r\n(See page 302)]\r\n\r\nwhere they can get a few colors to the pan, and find the bed rock\r\npitching. They are the spirits of Jeff, Yank, Old Pike, Tennessee,\r\nJersey and Jim, the old Forty-niners.”\r\n\r\nIt is now forty years since a few thousands of hardy adventurers sailed\r\nout upon the broad ocean from the various sea ports on the Atlantic\r\ncoast, and also about an equal number of thousands crossed the barren\r\nplains in that eventful and long-to-be-remembered year of 1849, to\r\nfollow upon the trail of the Star of the Westward-bound Empire, which,\r\ntradition said, was coursing across the continent, and which was\r\nsupposed to have finally set somewhere upon the Pacific Coast. And what\r\na transformation has taken place since their arrival upon the shores of\r\nCalifornia! Here, where we first landed, where all appeared like a vast\r\narmy encampment, with the sand hills dotted with tents, we now find,\r\nin place of those primitive and original conditions, a great city, the\r\nfoundations of which were laid by those original tent-dwellers, and\r\nwhich has in a few short years sprung into existence as if impelled by\r\nsome magical-hidden subterranean influence in the mountain regions. And\r\nit is this magical influence, more potent than the lamp of Aladdin,\r\nwhich has accomplished such wonderful transformations in so short a\r\nspace of time that we have come thousands of miles by sea, as well\r\nas across barren sands and deserts, to seek for the widely scattered\r\nfragments of the once richly paved streets of the “New Jerusalem.”\r\n\r\nThese wonderful transformations are not, however, confined to the few\r\nlarge cities of the plains, or to those the foundations of which are\r\nlaid by the sea, but are visible over the entire country, for even\r\namong the hills and mountains ranges, as well as in the broad and rich\r\nvalley bottoms, can now be seen the pleasant homes and residences of\r\nthe farmer, the fruit, and the vine grower. There can also be seen\r\noccasionally the homes of those who are yet engaged in the mining\r\nindustry. There can yet be seen, also, among the deep ravines, upon the\r\nlevel spots of the steep sides of the cañons, and in other localities,\r\nthe ruins of the once pleasant homes of the old Forty-niners; but\r\nthese have, in the great majority of cases, like the greater number\r\nof their once happy and energetic occupants, gone to decay. Many of\r\nthem, however, yet exist in form, and to all outward appearances, from\r\na distance, have an air of usefulness and solidity; but upon a nearer\r\napproach it will be\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHANTOM PROSPECTORS.]\r\n\r\nfound that the foundation only remains; the bark upon the old logs has\r\nrotted and fallen off, and the decayed logs have a seedy, antiquated\r\nappearance. The once palatial residences of the old-timers, which have\r\nwithstood the storms and battled with the elements for nearly forty\r\nyears, are now, like many of their former occupants, existing only\r\nin form. They have fought the fight and have won, and many of them\r\nare yet in existence, roaming upon various portions of the earth’s\r\nsurface, resembling in their seedy and antiquated appearance the old\r\nlogs of their ancient castles among the mountain ranges, and like these\r\nrequiring but a slight push or a gentle breeze to throw them from their\r\nfoundations into the ravine below.\r\n\r\nYet there is, after all, among the old Forty-niners a great\r\nsatisfaction when, from a commanding eminence or standing upon the\r\nrugged cliff of some mountain peak, the Argonaut can take a view of\r\nthe surrounding country spread out before him below, and see the\r\npleasant homes upon the flats, among the ravines and sunny slopes of\r\nthe hillsides of the once thickly populated mining region. The country\r\nthat once was dreary and desolate, now covered with extensive forests\r\nof fruits and vineyards; and away further back among the hills, where\r\nformerly dwelt the grizzly and other wild animals, can now be seen the\r\ncabins of the herders with their immense droves of cattle and flocks\r\nof sheep. In the valleys below he can see fields of waving grain,\r\nand the railroad trains rushing through them in various directions,\r\nfilled with travelers from all parts of the world who have come to view\r\nthis wonderful transformation scene. He includes, also, in the view\r\nthe great cities beyond, which have risen during this brief period,\r\nand are now filled with a busy crowd, all engaged in fierce warfare,\r\nendeavoring to see who will get there first, and in which none are\r\nanticipating that they will get left.\r\n\r\nAll this the old-timer views from his lofty perch upon the mountain\r\nsummit, and with these thoughts running in his mind:\r\n\r\n“Although I am not at present in a suitable condition or circumstances\r\nto take an active part in the busy scene, or even to mingle with the\r\nwell-dressed crowds that are promenading the streets of the great\r\ncities (for the stylish plug hat that I sported in my early mining\r\ndays has long since been jammed and knocked out of shape by my mining\r\nacquaintances, my store clothes are in tatters, and my biled shirt\r\nand fancy necktie also have long since faded and gone), yet there is\r\nconsolation in the thought that I assisted by my labor to lay the\r\nfoundation of all this grand panorama, in motion below me. And amid the\r\nsolid rocks which form the foundation, and beneath the corner-stone\r\nupon which the whole fabric rests, will be found the results of my\r\nlabor, cheerfully contributed towards the erection of this grand and\r\nnoble structure.”\r\n\r\nTo an old-timer, the wonderful changes and transformations which have\r\ntaken place within, apparently, so short a space of time are hard\r\nto realize; and one who has followed the business of mining, more\r\nparticularly for many years, finds it difficult, even, to grasp the\r\nfact that so many long years have come and gone since he first landed\r\nupon the shores of the country.\r\n\r\nBut why does life seem so short to the miner, and why do the years\r\nseem to crowd so quickly upon each other, and to pass in such rapid\r\nsuccession? That such, however, is the case, and that we grow up amid\r\nthe excitement of such conditions unconscious of the existence of time,\r\nall old miners can testify to. We find that before we are aware of it\r\nour hair is tinged with gray; our children grown up around us; they,\r\nin their turn are married, and lo, and behold, we, the old-timers, who\r\nhave remained unconscious of the fact that time will not even wait for\r\na Forty-niner, are to our astonishment informed that we have attained\r\nat last to that period of our existence when we can adopt the title of\r\nfather with the grand in front of it. But why does time pass so rapidly\r\nwith those who are engaged in mining? Is it in the climate? No, but\r\nin the industry which we follow. We read in Pope that man never is,\r\nbut always to be, blessed, and this applies to the business of mining\r\nwith full force; for the miner never has yet, but always is just going\r\nto strike it. It is always just a little ahead, and so it continues\r\nto the miner, for but a small proportion of them ever reach it. Yet\r\nthe continuation of daily, weekly and yearly anticipations, as yet\r\nunrealized, but which are soon to be, causes time to pass unobserved,\r\nand the old Forty-niner, who, in his imagination, has been here but a\r\nfew short years, finds to his astonishment, when the little ones are\r\nclimbing over him, pulling his whiskers and calling him “Grandpa,” when\r\nhe comes to think of it, as old Pike would say, that he has been here a\r\nright smart chance.\r\n\r\nBut the old miner might ask if this is not true of all other kinds of\r\nbusiness, or of human affairs in general, as well as the business of\r\nmining? No, only to a limited extent, although, ’tis true enough, as\r\nobservation and experience shows us, that the continual expectation of\r\nthe satisfaction of our desires is the fundamental base of all human\r\naction; the one great incentive to exertion. We find, however, that\r\nwhilst a reasonable length of time in which to satisfy our desires is\r\nallowed and expected in all other kinds of business, in mining the\r\ncase is reversed. And it was for this reason that thousands left their\r\nEastern homes, upon the discovery of gold in California, believing\r\nit possible that gold in large quantities could be scraped up from\r\nthe surface of the earth in a very short space of time. If a proper\r\nknowledge of gold mining had been as well understood at that time as\r\nhas since been acquired by dearly-bought experience, and that only\r\nabout the same proportion of persons would have succeeded in it as was\r\npossible in any other business requiring the same space of time for its\r\ndevelopment, the emigration to this Coast would have been much less\r\nin early days. The amount extracted from the mines would, no doubt,\r\nhave been the same and with similar effects, perhaps. At any rate, the\r\nexpectations of the early pioneers would have been more reasonable, and\r\ndisappointments in the business of mining would have been less, since\r\nthey would have corresponded with such expectations.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that forty years have now elapsed since the\r\nexciting news was wafted across the continent that gold had been\r\ndiscovered upon the Pacific Coast, it would be of great interest to\r\nknow what has become of this vast army of gold seekers, the Argonauts,\r\nwho left their friends and homes in the year ’49.\r\n\r\nThe estimate has been made that the number of vessels which sailed from\r\nthe Atlantic seaports of the United States in the year ’49, including\r\nsteamers bound for California, was something near 400. The number of\r\npersons, including the emigration across the plains in ’49, therefore,\r\nwho left their Eastern homes in the year ’49 to seek their fortunes\r\nupon this side of the continent, must have been nearly 60,000. Taking\r\nan estimate of those who are now living, and of those who joined the\r\nvarious Pioneer Associations, it would be safe to conclude that there\r\nare living at present of that vast multitude, at least 15,000. About\r\n8,000 of them are living upon the Pacific Coast, while the greater\r\nportion of the remainder are scattered\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FLIGHT OF TIME.]\r\n\r\nthroughout the United States from Bangor, Maine, to New Orleans on the\r\nsouth, and to Colorado in a westerly direction.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of the Argonauts are making their homes in the\r\ntowns and cities, where very many of them are yet engaged in active\r\nbusiness; while a journey throughout the agricultural districts of the\r\nPacific Coast will discover the fact that large numbers are engaged\r\nin farming in all its various branches of grain, fruit and stock\r\nraising. In some of the mining counties will be found, also, many of\r\nthe old-timers who have abandoned the business of mining, and are now\r\nengaged in the fruit industry, and in many cases, too, in the very\r\nsame localities where they mined long years ago. They have filled up\r\nthe deep shafts, levelled off the piles of rocks and tailings, and by\r\nmeans of brush dams have restored again to their original condition the\r\nbarren and stony places which were washed out in the search for gold.\r\n\r\nA visit to some of the now deserted mining camps throughout the mining\r\nregions, will bring to light many of the old pioneers who are yet\r\nlingering around the spot where they first located upon their arrival,\r\nloath to break away from their first and earliest associations, and\r\ncontent to remain and live over again, in imagination, the early mining\r\ndays, with their pleasing incidents and associations. Of the Argonauts\r\nwho are at present engaged in mining the number would be found small,\r\nnot exceeding, perhaps, 500. But they are scattered throughout the\r\nlength and breath of the Pacific Coast, wherever there is a prospect of\r\nnew mining discoveries, from Mexico to the Arctic Ocean, and a few of\r\nthem will be found in every mining camp of any importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “HOW DO YOU DO, WILLIAM?”]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN--GREAT CHANGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nJo.--Good morning, William, how do you do?\r\n\r\nWilliam.--Very well, very well, I thank you, but you have the advantage\r\nof me, sir.\r\n\r\nJo.--Why; don’t you remember Jo, your old chum?\r\n\r\nW.--What! is this Jo? is it possible? so it is, so it is. When did you\r\narrive from California?\r\n\r\nJo.--I have just arrived.\r\n\r\nW.--Did you return by water, Jo?\r\n\r\nJo.--Oh, no! I came by rail across the continent.\r\n\r\nW.--Well, I suppose there are a great many of the boys of ’49 still\r\nliving in California and intending to end their days there, are there\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nJo.--Oh, yes, there are several thousand remaining upon the Pacific\r\nCoast, and they all seem contented with their new homes.\r\n\r\nW.--Well, how many are there now living of the Forty-niners; have you\r\nany idea, Jo?\r\n\r\nJo.--Judging from the number of those who are now living who joined\r\nthe Pioneer Associations in the various States, there must be at least\r\nabout 15,000.\r\n\r\nW.--Well, that was a grand and pleasant adventure, the departure of so\r\nmany thousands for the other side of the continent to search for gold,\r\nwasn’t it? and I suppose you boys all enjoyed it, too, and profited by\r\nthe experience?\r\n\r\nJo.--Yes, we certainly did, and I doubt if there was ever in the\r\nhistory of the world an adventure similar in character and magnitude,\r\nand which created such wonderful effects as the gold discovery of\r\nCalifornia, for as far as our observation extends, the existence of\r\nsuch another vast gold field is improbable, unless it may be that in\r\nthe unexplored regions of Africa rich gold fields may exist, but even\r\nif such discoveries should be made, such are the numbers and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RETURN]\r\n\r\ncharacter of the savage tribes that inhabit those regions, they would\r\nbe of little value to the civilized world.\r\n\r\nW.--Well, I suppose you observe the great changes that have taken place\r\nhere upon this side of the continent since you left forty years ago?\r\n\r\nJo.--Yes, indeed, I do, and ’tis difficult to realize the great changes\r\nthat have taken place in so short a space of time, and which are\r\nvisible when crossing the continent from Hangtown to Jersey, for towns\r\nand cities have sprung into existence, and sections of the country\r\nare now thickly populated where but a few short years ago were barren\r\ndesert places, occupied only by roving bands of savages. And all of\r\nthese changed conditions are due to the gold discovery in California.\r\n\r\nW.--Yes, yes, you are right, and it was the means also, through the\r\nenergy of you gold diggers, of building up a great and a prosperous\r\ncountry upon the other side of the continent, as well as producing a\r\ncondition of prosperity over the entire country. But, Jo, I want you\r\nto tell me why it is that so few of you old pioneers succeeded in your\r\nexpectations of obtaining great wealth in a country where so much gold\r\nwas dug from the earth, for it seems to me that you are the ones who\r\nshould have been the most successful.\r\n\r\nJo.--Yes, it does seem so, but if we did not succeed in holding on to\r\nwhat we dug from the earth, at any rate we have the satisfaction of\r\nknowing that our friends here in the East got their share of it in the\r\ncourse of their business transactions.\r\n\r\nW.--Oh, well, that’s very generous of you old miners, and no doubt is a\r\ngreat satisfaction.\r\n\r\nJo.--Yes, and I hope that you received your share; did you not?\r\n\r\nW.--Oh, well, yes, yes, moderately! only moderately so; but then I’ve\r\nno cause to complain; no cause to complain. But tell me, Jo, why it was\r\nthat you boys who dug it out of the earth didn’t keep your share, too?\r\n\r\nJo.--That I will endeavor to do if you will explain to me why it was\r\nthat after we had dug it from the earth, and had shipped it to you\r\nhere in the East by the ton, so small a proportion of you succeeded in\r\ngetting a share of it?\r\n\r\nW.--Does the idea seem to strike you that our great prosperity here\r\nis not general, and that only a small portion of us are enjoying the\r\nadvantages of the great gold circulation.\r\n\r\nJo.--Yes, from all the evidences, with a money circulation of nearly\r\nfifteen hundred millions of gold that has been sent to you here at\r\nthe East, there does not appear to exist a general prosperity, for\r\nthe strikes, the great labor organizations, and the various theories\r\nadopted by your agitators and explained from the platform are evidence\r\nof the fact that a great portion, at least, do not share in the general\r\nprosperity. Now, why is this?\r\n\r\nW.--Well, I must admit that such is really the case, and that there\r\nshould exist so much poverty with such a great money circulation is\r\ndifficult of comprehension. Can you explain the phenomenon, Jo?\r\n\r\nJo.--Hardly, William, for you know that it is the business of the\r\nminer to dig the gold from the earth only, and for the business men of\r\nthe country, who use it, to devise the proper means for its use and\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nW.--Yes, that is true enough, true enough; and that it is not equally\r\ndistributed, and that all portions of our country and persons do not\r\nshare in the use and possession of it, is, in my opinion, an evidence\r\nthat the conditions created by the improper use of it are not well\r\nunderstood. Is that your opinion?\r\n\r\nJo.--That may be possible. Will you explain further?\r\n\r\nW.--Yes. All of these dissensions that exist among us, such as the\r\nland-reform agitators, the socialist and the labor organizations,\r\nstrikes, the anarchist with his bomb, as well as the inclination to\r\nmonkey with dynamite generally, by a certain class of men, are but\r\nthe effects (indirectly, perhaps,) of the great amount of our gold\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nJo.--I see, William, that you still entertain the same old Puritanical\r\nnotions of too much money, and all of our labor has been in vain, then.\r\n\r\nW.--Oh, no, your labor has not been in vain, Jo. Send us all the gold\r\nfrom California that you possibly can, for the annual yield from your\r\nmines is hardly sufficient now to make up for wear and tear, and for\r\nwhat is sent to foreign countries. What I mean is, that there is too\r\nmuch gold in circulation to the ratio of silver, for the general good.\r\n\r\nJo.--Then, in your opinion, if there was a greater amount of silver\r\nin circulation to the ratio of gold it would change these unnatural\r\nconditions that now exist?\r\n\r\nW.--Yes, I most certainly do, Jo.\r\n\r\nJo.--Will you explain why?\r\n\r\nW.--Well, observation shows us that the great bulk of the gold from\r\nCalifornia seems to concentrate in the chief towns and cities. Now\r\nthis, of course, is to the advantage of the bankers and capitalists\r\ngenerally, and is the chief reason why that class of men advocate the\r\nsingle standard. Now ’tis plain to see the effect of this, for we all\r\nhave a desire to obtain gold, and it was that reason, and to satisfy\r\nthat desire, that sent thousands of you boys around Cape Horn and\r\nacross the barren deserts to California, was it not?\r\n\r\nJo.--Well, yes, that was the case.\r\n\r\nW.--And with the desire to acquire wealth in the easiest and quickest\r\nmanner possible, and with the least labor, now wasn’t that the idea, Jo?\r\n\r\nJo.--That was our idea of it, William.\r\n\r\nW.--Well since the greater portion of the gold from your mines flows\r\ninto the towns and chief cities, and to linger there, and since all\r\nhave the desire to get a share of it in the easiest and quickest\r\nmanner, and with as little exertion as possible, it is therefore\r\nevident that in order to do so, it was necessary to go into the towns\r\nand cities after it, was it not?\r\n\r\nJo.--That must be the conclusion.\r\n\r\nW.--Now this increased gold circulation had the effect of stimulating\r\nall the various industries; this created a demand for labor, raised the\r\nprice of it, and brought to our shores the surplus laborers of Europe\r\nwho desired to get their share of it, but this was not all, Jo, for the\r\nlaborers of the farming districts all over the country rushed into the\r\nbig cities also, and these are the evil effects produced. Why, you ask?\r\nbecause this concentration of labor from foreign lands and from the\r\nagricultural districts into our great cities created an over supply of\r\nlabor which is the direct cause of all these dissensions among us. Now\r\ndon’t you have that idea of it, Jo?\r\n\r\nJo.--Well, perhaps you are right, and in your opinion the circulation\r\nof silver to an amount equal to gold will remedy the evil, is that it?\r\n\r\nW.--Yes, yes, but don’t speak too loud or my associates in the bank\r\nover there may overhear our conversation, and censure me for holding\r\nopinions and advocating a policy that would be rather detrimental to\r\nour business.\r\n\r\nJo.--What! you a banker, William?\r\n\r\nW.--Oh, yes, in a small way.\r\n\r\nJo.--Well, then, I can return your compliment by saying that it is very\r\ngenerous in you to advocate a policy for the general good that would be\r\ndetrimental to your business.\r\n\r\nW.--Yes, yes, but I think the time is soon coming when ’twill be\r\nnecessary to adopt such a policy, for the present gold circulation is\r\nbringing into existence such a state of affairs that a reaction must,\r\nfrom the nature of things, take place. But I do not wish you to infer,\r\nJo, that the great abundance of gold that you miners have sent us has\r\nbeen the direct cause of such unnatural conditions; by no means, but it\r\nis in the manner of using it. Now you know that if you should spread\r\nupon some barren sandy spot certain fertilizing substances, with a\r\nlittle water, and fail to properly prepare and cultivate the ground,\r\nthat weeds and poisonous plants will come into existence upon the\r\nspot, these plants are entirely useless, perhaps, but this fact does\r\nnot prove that the fertilizing substance was an injury by any means,\r\nbut only that it was improperly used, and just so it is with gold and\r\nsilver. These metals are the fertilizers for all human industries, and\r\nthe various socialist theories, labor organizations, strikes, etc., are\r\nthe obnoxious weeds brought into existence by its improper use. Now, am\r\nI not right, Jo?\r\n\r\nJo.--That may be the case, but, please tell me, William, why the\r\ngreater circulation of silver will change such conditions.\r\n\r\nW.--Well, for the reasons that silver will circulate more freely among\r\nthe working classes, and also in the country among the small villages\r\nand farmers.\r\n\r\nJo.--Can you give good reasons why silver would circulate more freely,\r\nand to a much greater extent in the agricultural districts than gold?\r\n\r\nWm.--Certainly, certainly I can; for the reason why gold concentrates\r\ninto the great centers of population is because it can be used to much\r\nbetter advantage by the bankers, brokers and our larger business houses\r\nin the cities; it is easier to handle in large sums, requires less\r\nspace for its storage, and its value being more uniform than silver\r\nthere is therefore less risk in hoarding it up; these are the principal\r\nreasons why a single gold standard is more to the interest of the\r\nbusiness community, and to us bankers in particular.\r\n\r\nJo.--Now please explain the effects which will be produced upon the\r\ncountry generally, and how such changed conditions will be created by\r\nthe circulation of a greater proportion of silver, for even granting,\r\nas you maintain, that silver will circulate more freely among the\r\nfarmers, why will this fact create a change for the better?\r\n\r\nW.--Well, it is plain, Jo, that the less is the gold in circulation\r\nto the ratio of silver the less will be the facilities for acquiring\r\nit, for since the bankers, etc., will have little desire to hoard up\r\nthe latter, the greater will be its circulation, and for this reason\r\nwill circulate more freely among the working men, as well as among the\r\nfarming community.\r\n\r\nJo.--Well, granting that it will, as you say, give to the agricultural\r\ndistricts an increased circulation of money, what good effects are to\r\nresult?\r\n\r\nW.--Now, here is just the point, Jo, for is it not plain that our\r\nsingle standard gold circulation has caused very injurious effects\r\nupon such remote portions of the country, and which proves that the\r\ngreat prosperity is not general, by any means. That it has built up\r\nlarge cities is very true, as well as transportation facilities, by\r\nbuilding thousands of miles of railroads, but how about the farming\r\nindustry of the country? Should not that also receive its proper share\r\nof prosperity enjoyed by the thicker settled portions of the country? I\r\nshould think so, shouldn’t you, Jo?\r\n\r\nJo.--Why, yes, I should certainly think so.\r\n\r\nW.--Well, but how does the case stand? Whilst a few persons have been\r\nenabled to acquire immense wealth in our large cities, the greater\r\nportion of our farming lands from Maine to Iowa are heavily mortgaged,\r\nand here in the New England States an entire new order of things has\r\nbeen inaugurated, for the sons and daughters of the farmers have gone\r\ninto the cities in order to acquire wealth by an easier method than\r\nfarming, and the farming lands, which were almost entirely deserted\r\nby the younger ones, are falling into the hands of foreigners, and in\r\nsome portions of the country at the West it is impossible to procure\r\nlabor sufficient to harvest the crops. Havn’t you observed this in your\r\ntraveling about the country, Jo?\r\n\r\nJo.--Yes, I have, for only a short time since I visited a district\r\nwhere I once lived, in the State of New York, and I found that about\r\nall who are now living there upon the farms are the old people. The\r\nyounger ones have nearly all gone into the towns and cities to engage\r\nin business, to learn trades and professions. I must say that in the\r\nabsence of the younger members of the country it gives to it a sad and\r\na dreary look, and in some few cases a very desolate appearance, for\r\nI saw a portion of the country which forty years ago was rich farming\r\nland, but such is its condition now that if a resident of the sandy\r\nsage-brush lands of Colorado or Utah could be transported and placed\r\nupon it, he would feel perfectly contented, and would not pine for his\r\nWestern home.\r\n\r\nThey tell me also that it is almost impossible to obtain assistance\r\nto harvest their crops, and in many cases are compelled to send to\r\nNew York for foreign laborers. Yes, ’tis evident, William, that great\r\nchanges have taken place in the past forty years, at least in this\r\nportion of the country. Whilst visiting that section of the country I\r\nmet an old lady, a former school-mate, and she spoke of the changes\r\nthat had taken place in a sad tone.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said she, “this is not the country that it was in our day, for\r\nthe young people all leave the farms for the big cities as soon as they\r\nget old enough.”\r\n\r\nIn answer to my inquiry in relation to a few of my former companions\r\nshe said:\r\n\r\n“They all went into the towns and cities; some learned to be doctors\r\nand some to be lawyers; some one thing and some another. Do you\r\nremember Sam Hobbs? Well, he got to be head engineer in a sausage\r\nfactory and made lots of money. And then there is Al Peck; you remember\r\nhim, of course? Well, he was up here on a visit a few years ago\r\ndressed up in the finest rig, with his gold watch, and diamond pin and\r\nthings. He said that he was superintendent of a gin-fizz mill, if you\r\nknow what that is, for I am sure I don’t. Well, Al is real kind and\r\ntender-hearted, for he did sympathize with John so much because he had\r\nto rake hay out in the hot sun, and then he pitied us all so much, too,\r\nbecause we were compelled to live way out here in the country so far\r\nfrom the city, that it was really distressing to hear him.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes,” she continued, “but those were happy days. What gay times\r\nwe had in the winter, and how we all did enjoy piling into the big\r\nsleigh and going to the singing-schools and parties around the country,\r\nas well as to the apple and the husking bees, too. But all of those\r\npleasant times are past, Jo. I don’t believe that you could get enough\r\nyoung men and girls together now around here in the country to start\r\none of them old-fashioned kissing bees.”\r\n\r\nAnd my old school companion has a good memory, too, William, for she\r\ncontinued by asking:\r\n\r\n“Do you remember, Jo, the husking bee that you had in your father’s\r\nbig barn? ’Twas in ’48, I think, the year before you started for\r\nCalifornia. I remember well, Jo, how you went the day before and hid\r\naway in a handy place a whole bushel of red ears of corn and got more\r\nthan your share of the fun. How selfish that was in you, wasn’t it, Jo,\r\nto go and leave the other boys shivering out in the cold? Oh, well, I\r\nsuppose you have long since repented of it; havn’t you?”\r\n\r\nI told the old lady that I certainly had, but said I:\r\n\r\n“Mary, although ’tis a pleasure to recall to mind such pleasing\r\nincidents and events of our boyhood days, yet as we advance in years we\r\noften have cause to grieve for neglected opportunities in the past, and\r\nin recalling to mind the little incident you have mentioned, with its\r\nhappy surroundings, pretty girls and a bushel of corn, there comes over\r\nme a feeling of sadness and of sorrow that I didn’t--”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t what, Jo?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“That I didn’t make it two bushels instead of one,” I answered.\r\n\r\nW.--Well, it is very evident that the conditions under which we are now\r\nexisting must be changed, for society, as well as the future welfare of\r\nour country, demands it.\r\n\r\nJo.--Well, what is your opinion of the various theories advanced by\r\nGeorge, Bellamy and others. Would they not afford relief if adopted?\r\n\r\nW.--That is possible, but a transient relief only, for they do not\r\nremove the absolute cause of it all; these remedies advocated by them\r\nare to our national, political and social organizations, what the drug\r\nof the physician is to the human or physical organization; while they\r\nmay afford relief, they do not effect a permanent cure, or remove the\r\ncause of the disease. Now, according to our present state and condition\r\nof affairs, whilst our commercial interests are of first importance,\r\nand the building up of our great cities, with their 14 and 16 story\r\nbuildings, the chief aim and consideration, the agricultural interests\r\nare entirely overlooked, and rich farming districts are almost\r\nentirely depopulated or occupied by a foreign race. I know that to the\r\ngreat mass of bustling business men in our cities, these facts seem of\r\nvery trifling importance, but, Jo, what would your gold of California\r\nbe good for without the products of the soil to give it value, for the\r\nvalue of gold and silver is dependent upon, and determined entirely\r\nby, the amount of such productions. Why, Jo, if the wheat crop of the\r\nworld should from any cause be reduced one-half, the amount of gold in\r\ncirculation being relatively greater it would consequently be cheaper,\r\nand would require a hatful of it to purchase a barrel of flour, and if\r\nthe crops were an entire failure you couldn’t sell your gold for more\r\nthan 25 cents a bushel.\r\n\r\nJo.--I don’t exactly understand why it is, or what possible reason\r\nthese socialist reformers can have for maintaining that the private\r\nownership of land is the chief cause of the existence of poverty and\r\ndistress among us, when there are millions of acres of unoccupied lands\r\nnow open to settlement, with labor in demand in the farming districts,\r\nas well as good opportunities for renting, leasing, or for working upon\r\nshares good farming lands within a short distance from our large cities.\r\n\r\nW.--Yes, yes, that is all true enough, but these agitators in saying\r\nthat the private ownership of land is the cause of poverty have no\r\nreference whatever, Jo, to farming lands, but only to city lots, for\r\ntheir ideas do not extend beyond the city limits. Why, did you ever\r\nhear of one of these men advising the unemployed workingmen to go into\r\nthe country, occupy the public lands, and live by the cultivation of\r\nthe soil? No, you never did.\r\n\r\nJo.--Well, I suppose that it would be a useless undertaking to try\r\nto induce persons, even those who were brought up and raised upon a\r\nfarm (as no doubt the great majority of the idle men in your cities\r\nwere), to leave the bustle and excitement of a city life and to live in\r\nsolitude upon a farm.\r\n\r\nW.--Yes, no doubt it would, and could hardly be expected of them;\r\nbut the inducements should be such that the rising generation of the\r\nfarming districts will be satisfied and content to remain there in the\r\nfuture, and this can in my opinion be accomplished by remitting all\r\ntaxes upon farming land for a certain number of years, that is, upon\r\nsuch lands as are located in the more remote sections of the country,\r\nand including, of course, also the adoption of the double standard of\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nJo.--Do you mean that the present money circulation should be increased\r\nby an equal amount of silver?\r\n\r\nWm.--Oh, no, no! I don’t believe that our money circulation should be\r\nincreased one dollar, but that a certain amount of silver should be\r\nsubstituted in place of the same amount of gold to be withdrawn from\r\ncirculation; this, as I said before, would have the effect of causing a\r\nmore extended circulation of money throughout the country, which again\r\nwould have the effect of creating a wider field for the distribution of\r\nlabor. Now, am I not right, Jo?\r\n\r\nJo.--Yes, I think you are, and the good effects that would result would\r\nbe only a question of time. But allow me to ask if there do not exist\r\nother causes why the sons and daughters of the farmers are so ready\r\nto leave their homes and crowd into the towns and cities, besides the\r\ndesire to make money easier and quicker?\r\n\r\nW.--Oh, yes! Yet these other causes are the effects of the causes\r\nbefore mentioned, for the farmers themselves, the great majority of\r\nthem, look upon farming as simply a business speculation, and that it\r\nis really necessary to make all the money possible in order to make it\r\npay; this kind of farming means hard work for all, and drudgery for the\r\nwomen folks, and to escape from it the only refuge is the city; but\r\nthat ain’t farming, Jo.\r\n\r\nJo.--No, it is not. Whilst up in the country I made a visit to a farm\r\nhouse where I often visited in early days, and the old lady had much to\r\nsay about the desolate appearance of the country now that the younger\r\nones had all left. “Well,” says she “the farmers themselves are the\r\ncause of it all, for all they thought about was what money they could\r\nmake off the farm, and they didn’t seem to realize that there was any\r\nuse at all in trying to fix up the place for a pleasant home for the\r\nboys and girls, that would induce them to remain with us; our boys have\r\nbeen gone now for many years, and rather than to see the girls worn out\r\nwith this endless drudgery, I advised them several years ago to go into\r\nthe village and work in the factory.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” she continued “we have the farm here yet, what there is left\r\nof it, but it wouldn’t sell for enough now to pay off the mortgage;\r\ndo you see yonder the 50-acre lot where we used to raise such large\r\ncrops of corn; it is all covered now with weeds and briars for it has\r\nbeen farmed to death, and just see the poor crows sitting on the fence\r\nbeyond; they, too, seem to realize the situation, and every little\r\nwhile they fly over the cornfield and wonder, I suppose, why the\r\nboys don’t start to planting corn. I really pity them.” The old lady\r\ncontinued by saying “farming is not now what it was when I was a girl;\r\nthen the farmers took a pride in fixing up and making the house and\r\ngrounds attractive, and there was a pleasure then in living upon the\r\nold homestead until we children all got married and moved away. Well, I\r\nam thankful that my girls didn’t marry farmers; they are not wealthy,\r\nthey both married mechanics down in the village; they have nice\r\ncomfortable homes and pretty children; are happy, and I am contented,\r\nand I expect that we will soon move down into the village, too, for\r\nthere is a man here who wants to take the place to work upon shares for\r\na few years, and I guess he can have it as long as he wants it.”\r\n\r\nW.--Yes, the picture you have drawn of that section of the country, Jo,\r\nwill apply equally as well to other parts of the country, for the great\r\ndesire to make money by farming has been the ruin of some of our most\r\nvaluable farming lands. Well, I must leave you now, but please tell\r\nme, Jo, why you brought your mining tools with you? Did you expect to\r\nstrike a lead on the way across the continent?\r\n\r\nJo.--Well, yes, I thought it possible. How is the bed rock over there\r\nunder your bank, pitching?\r\n\r\nW.---- Yes, but we don’t allow any prospecting or panning around there;\r\ncall in and see us, Jo, but don’t bring your mining tools along, so\r\ngood-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAMES OF PIONEERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing are the names of Members of the Pioneer Association of San\r\nFrancisco:\r\n\r\n=A=--A G Abell, W Ayer, T N Allen, J P
