Within his forty\r\nyears of life, he discovered a very large area of what is now an\r\nimportant region of the earth; he participated in stirring events which\r\nare memorable in modern history; he applied a vigorous and original mind\r\nto the advancement of knowledge, with useful results; and he was the\r\nvictim of circumstances which, however stated, were peculiarly\r\nunfortunate, and must evoke the sympathy of everyone who takes the\r\ntrouble to understand them. His career was crowded with adventures: war,\r\nperilous voyages, explorations of unknown coasts, encounters with\r\nsavages, shipwreck and imprisonment are the elements which go to make up\r\nhis story. He was, withal, a downright Englishman of exceptionally high\r\ncharacter, proud of his service and unsparing of himself in the pursuit\r\nof his duty.\r\n\r\nYet up to this time his biography has not been written. There are, it is\r\ntrue, outlines of his career in various works of reference, notably that\r\ncontributed by Sir J.K. Laughton to the Dictionary of National Biography.\r\nBut there is no book to which a reader can turn for a fairly full account\r\nof his achievements, and an estimate of his personality. Of all\r\ndiscoverers of leading rank Matthew Flinders is the only one about whom\r\nthere is no ample and convenient record.\r\n\r\nThis book endeavours to fill the gap.\r\n\r\nThe material upon which it is founded is set forth in the footnotes and\r\nthe bibliography. Here the author takes pleasure in acknowledging the\r\nassistance he has received from several quarters. A previous book brought\r\nhim the acquaintance of the grand-nephew of that Comte de Fleurieu who\r\nlargely inspired three famous French voyages to Australia--those of\r\nLaperouse, Dentrecasteaux and Baudin--all of which have an important\r\nbearing upon the subject. The Comte A. de Fleurieu had long been engaged\r\nin collecting material relative to the work and influence of his\r\ndistinguished grand-uncle, and in the most generous manner he handed over\r\nto the author his very large collection of manuscripts and note-books to\r\nbe read, noted, and used at discretion. Even when a historian does not\r\nactually quote or directly use matter bearing upon his subject, it is of\r\nimmense advantage to have access to documents which throw light upon it,\r\nand which enable an in-and-out knowledge of a period and persons to be\r\nobtained. This book owes much of whatever value it may possess to\r\nmonsieur de Fleurieu's assistance in this respect, and the author thanks\r\nhim most warmly.\r\n\r\nThe Flinders papers, of which free use has been made, were presented to\r\nthe Melbourne Public Library by Professor W.M. Flinders Petrie. They are\r\ndescribed in the bibliography. The transcripts of family and personal\r\ndocuments were especially valuable. Although they were not supplied for\r\nthis book, Professor Flinders Petrie gave them in order that they might\r\nbe of use to some biographer of his grandfather, and the author begs to\r\nthank him, and also Mr. E La Touche Armstrong, the chief librarian, in\r\nwhose custody they are, and who has given frequent access to them.\r\n\r\nThe rich stores of manuscripts in the Mitchell Library, Sydney, have been\r\nthoroughly examined, with the assistance of Mr. W.H. Ifould, principal\r\nlibrarian, Mr. Hugh Wright, and the staff of that institution. Help from\r\nthis quarter was accorded with such grace that one came to think giving\r\ntrouble was almost like conferring a favour.\r\n\r\nAll copies of documents from Paris and Caen cited in this book have been\r\nmade by Madame Robert Helouis. The author was able to indicate the\r\nwhereabouts of the principal papers, but Madame Helouis, developing an\r\ninterest in the subject as she pursued her task, was enabled, owing to\r\nher extensive knowledge of the resources of the French archives, to find\r\nand transcribe many new and valuable papers. The author also wishes to\r\nthank Captain Francis Bayldon, of Sydney, who has kindly given help on\r\nseveral technical points; Miss Alma Hansen, University of Melbourne, who\r\nwas generous enough to make a study of the Dutch Generale Beschrijvinge\r\nvan Indien--no light task--to verify a point of some importance for the\r\npurpose of the chapter on \"The Naming of Australia\"; and Mr. E.A.\r\nPetherick, whose manuscript bibliography, containing an immense quantity\r\nof material, the fruit of a long life's labour, has always been\r\ncheerfully made available.\r\n\r\nProfessor Flinders Petrie has been kind enough to read and make some\r\nuseful suggestions upon the personal and family passages of the book,\r\nwhich has consequently benefited greatly.\r\n\r\nThe whole work has been read through by Mr. A.W. Jose, author of The\r\nHistory of Australasia, whose criticism on a multitude of points, some\r\nminute, but all important, has been of the utmost value. The help given\r\nby Mr. Jose has been more than friendly; it has been informed by a keen\r\nenthusiasm for the subject, and great knowledge of the original\r\nauthorities. The author's obligations to him are gratefully acknowledged.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that these pages will enable the reader to know Matthew\r\nFlinders the man, as well as the navigator; for the study of the\r\nmanuscript and printed material about him has convinced the author that\r\nhe was not only remarkable for what he did and endured, but for his own\r\nsake as an Englishman of the very best type.\r\n\r\nMelbourne, June 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.

It seems he has not sent the\r\nPower, but says he enclosd something like one to you by which it appears\r\nhe is not exactly acquainted with the Business in Question, he tells me\r\nhe has explained his Sense of the Matter in your Letter and begd that the\r\nremaining Sum might be paid to Mr. Dixon or Mr. Lee, from whom he wishes\r\nme to receive it. When I wrote for the Power, I explaind to him (as far\r\nas my Knowledge of the Subject extended) the Necessity of his sending it,\r\nthat he was to consider himself as employd by Government, that it was\r\nfrom the Treasury his Salary was to be got and that they would require\r\nsome Authority for paying it to me--at present Sir, I am at a Loss how\r\nto proceed; whether what he has sent will be sufficient, or whether it\r\nwill still be necessary to get a regular Power is what I must trespass\r\nupon your Generosity for a Knowledge of the doing which will add to the\r\nObligation your Goodness before conferd upon me; with a gratefull Sense\r\nof which I beg leave to subscribe myself, Sir Joseph\r\n\r\nyour much obligd and\r\n\r\nmost humble Servant\r\n\r\nMattw.

A little to the westward of the rocky point,\r\nwhich has the inclining cones upon it, lies an island, between which and\r\nthe point, is a deep channel of between half and three-quarters of a mile\r\nwide; and about the same distance to the westward of this island, is\r\nanother of nearly the same size: they are rather low and covered with\r\nbrush and grass. Between these islands and Clarkes Island, we observed\r\ntwo low islets, and two rocks above water, the latter not more than three\r\nor four miles from us. To the southward also, we saw the land extending a\r\ngreat distance; but the whole are better seen in the sketch.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o'clock, the ebb tide was running with such violence, that\r\nalthough the schooner was going one knot and a half through the water,\r\nyet by the land we were evidently going retrograde almost as much, and\r\ntowards the land withal: but the light air that remained enabled us to\r\ndraw the ???\r\n\r\n\r\n10.

Notwithstanding this evident\r\nsuperiority, the vegetable Mould, is frequently, of nor great depth, and\r\nis sometimes, (perhaps advantageously) mixed with small quantities of\r\nsand.\r\n\r\nThe best of the soil, lies upon the sides of sloping hills, and in the\r\nbroad vallies between them. Some parts that are low and level, have a\r\nwet, peaty, surface, bounded by small tracts of flowering heath and\r\noderiferous plants, that perfume the air with the fragrance of their\r\noils.\r\n\r\nThe Plants, retain in general, the air of those of New South Wales,\r\nwhile, they are in reality, different. The rich & vivid colouring of the\r\nmore northern flowers, and that soft & exquisite graduation of their\r\ntints, for which they are so singularly distinguished, hold with them\r\nhere, but in a less eminent degree. The two countries present a perfect\r\nsimilarity in this, that the more barren spots are the most adorned.\r\n\r\nExcept in these useless places, the grass does not grow in tufts, but\r\ncovers the land equally, with a short, nutritious herbage, better adapted\r\npossibly, to the bite of small, than of large cattle. The food for the\r\nlatter, is grown in the bottoms of the vallies & upon the damp flats. A\r\nlarge proportion of the soil, promises a fair return, for the labours of\r\nthe cultivator, and a smaller, insures an ample reward: but the greater\r\npart, would perhaps turn to more advantage, if left for pasturage, than\r\nif thrown into cultivation; it would be rich as the one, but poor as the\r\nother.

He was furnished with a\r\npassport by order of His Imperial and Royal Majesty, then first Consul of\r\nFrance; and signed by the marine minister Forfait the 4th Prarial, year\r\n9; which passport permitted the Investigator to touch at French ports in\r\nany part of the world, in cases of distress, and promised assistance and\r\nprotection to the commander and company, provided they should not have\r\nunnecessarily deviated from their route, or have done, or announced the\r\nintention of doing any thing injurious to the French nation or its\r\nallies: Your memorialist sailed from England in July 1801, and in April\r\n1802, whilst pursuing the discovery of the unknown part of the south\r\ncoast of New South Wales, he met with the commandant Baudin, who being\r\nfurnished with a passport by the Admiralty of Great Britain, had been\r\nsent by the French government with the ships Geographe and Naturaliste\r\nupon a nearly similar expedition some months before.

PAGE FROM MANUSCRIPT OF FLINDERS' ABRIDGED NARRATIVE (UNPUBLISHED).\r\n\r\n(Melbourne Public Library.)\r\n\r\nfrom the general's conduct, that he has sought to impose upon him, and\r\nthis for the purpose, perhaps for the pleasure, of prolonging to the\r\nutmost my unjust detention.\r\n\r\nBut if apprehensions for the safety of this land are not the cause of the\r\norder of the French government remaining unexecuted, what reason can\r\nthere be, sufficiently strong to have induced the captain-general to\r\nincur the risk of misobedience, first to the passport, and afterwards to\r\nthe order for my liberation. This I shall endeavour to explain in the\r\nfollowing and last chapter of this discussion; promising, however, that\r\nwhat I shall have to offer upon this part of the subject, can only be\r\nwhat a consideration of the captain-general's conduct has furnished me,\r\nas being the most probable. I am not conscious of having omitted any\r\nmaterial circumstance, either here or in the narration, or of having\r\nmisrepresented any; as if after an attentive perusal, the reader thinks\r\nmy explanation not borne out by the facts, I submit it to his judgment to\r\ndeduce a better; and should esteem myself obliged by his making it\r\npublic, so that it may reach so far as even to me.\r\n\r\nChapter XII. Probable causes of my imprisonment, and of the marine\r\nminister's order for my liberation being suspended by the captain-general\r\n\r\nBefore explaining what I conceive to have been the true causes which led\r\nthe captain-general to act so contrary to my passport, as to imprison me\r\nand seize my vessel, charts, and papers; it will be proper to give the\r\nreader a knowledge of some points in His Excellency's character, in\r\naddition to those he will have extracted from the abridged narrative. At\r\nthe time of my arrival, he entertained, and does I believe still\r\nentertain, an indiscriminate animosity against Englishmen, whether this\r\narose from his having been deprived of the advantage of fixing the seat\r\nof his government at Pondicherry, by the renewal of war in 1803, or from\r\nany antecedent circumstance, I cannot pretend to say; but that he did\r\nharbour such animosity, and that in an uncommon degree, is averred by his\r\nkeeping in irons, contrary to the usages of war, the first English seamen\r\nthat were brought to the island (Narrative page 58 and 70); by the\r\nsurprise he testified at the proceeding of a French gentleman, who\r\ninterceded with him for the liberty on parole of a sick English officer;\r\non which occasion he said amongst other things, that had he his own will,\r\nhe would send all the English prisoners to the Marquis Wellesley without\r\ntheir ears: this animosity is, besides, as well known at the Isle of\r\nFrance, as the existence of the island.\r\n\r\nIt is probably owing to an original want of education, and to having\r\npassed the greater part of his life in the tumult of camps during the\r\nFrench revolution, that arises his indifference for the arts and\r\nsciences, other than those which have an immediate relation to war. His\r\nExcellency's ideas seem even to be so strictly military, that the\r\nprofession of a seaman has very little share in his  estimation; and his\r\nignorance of nautical affairs has been shewn by various circumstances to\r\nbe greater than would be supposed in a moderately well informed man, who\r\nhad made a voyage from Europe to India.\r\n\r\n\r\n36.

John Oxley of the Navy is going out\r\nsurveyor-general of Lands in New South Wales, I wish to point out to you,\r\nthat if he should be enabled, in intervals of his land duty, to\r\naccomplish the following nautical objects, in the vicinity of Port\r\nJackson, and of the settlements in Van Diemen's Land, our knowledge of\r\nthose coasts would be thereby improved, and some material advantages to\r\nthe colonies probably obtained.\r\n\r\n1st. Jervis Bay, a large piece of water whose entrance is in 35.5 south,\r\nand not from than 75 miles from Port Jackson, has never yet, to my\r\nknowledge been surveyed. There have been two or three eye sketches made\r\nof it; but it would be desirable to have it surveyed, with the streams\r\nwhich are said to fall into its North and western sides; and also the\r\ncorresponding line of the sea coast, in which there are thought to be\r\nstrata of coal.\r\n\r\nThe great semicircular range of mountains which has hitherto resisted all\r\nattempts to penetrate into the interior country behind Port Jackson,\r\nappears to terminate at Point Bass in latitude about 34.43; and the land\r\nbehind Jervis Bay is represented to be low and flat. It is, therefore,\r\nprobable, that a well conducted effort to obtain some knowledge of the\r\ninterior of that vast country, would be attended with success if made by\r\nsteering a West or N.N.W. course from the head of Jervis Bay.\r\n\r\n37.

BIRTH AND ORIGINS.\r\n\r\nMatthew Flinders was the third of the triad of great English sailors by\r\nwhom the principal part of Australia was revealed. A poet of our own\r\ntime, in a line of singular felicity, has described it as the \"last\r\nsea-thing dredged by sailor Time from Space; \"* (* Bernard O'Dowd,\r\nDawnward, 1903.) and the piecemeal, partly mysterious, largely accidental\r\ndragging from the depths of the unknown of a land so immense and\r\nbountiful makes a romantic chapter in geographical history. All the great\r\nseafaring peoples contributed something towards the result. The Dutch\r\nespecially evinced their enterprise in the pursuit of precise information\r\nabout the southern Terra Incognita, and the nineteenth century was well\r\nwithin its second quarter before the name New Holland, which for over a\r\nhundred years had borne testimony to their adventurous pioneering, gave\r\nplace in general and geographical literature to the more convenient and\r\neuphonious designation suggested by Flinders himself, Australia.* (* Not\r\nuniversally, however, even in official documents. In the Report of the\r\nCommittee of the Privy Council, dated May 1, 1849, \"New Holland\" is used\r\nto designate the continent, but \"Australia\" is employed as including both\r\nthe continent and Tasmania. See Grey's Colonial Policy 1 424 and 439.)\r\n\r\nBut, important as was the work of the Dutch, and though the contributions\r\nmade by French navigators (possibly also by Spanish) are of much\r\nconsequence, it remains true that the broad outlines of the continent\r\nwere laid down by Dampier, Cook and Flinders. These are the principal\r\nnames in the story. A map of Australia which left out the parts\r\ndiscovered by other sailors would be seriously defective in particular\r\nfeatures; but a map which left out the parts discovered by these three\r\nEnglishmen would gape out of all resemblance to the reality.\r\n\r\nDampier died about the year 1712; nobody knows precisely when. Matthew\r\nFlinders came into the world in time to hear, as he may well have done as\r\na boy, of the murder of his illustrious predecessor in 1779. The news of\r\nCook's fate did not reach England till 1781. The lad was then seven years\r\nof age, having been born on March 16th, 1774.\r\n\r\nHis father, also named Matthew, was a surgeon practising his profession\r\nat Donington, Lincolnshire, where the boy was born. The Flinders family\r\nhad been settled in the same town for several generations. Three in\r\nsuccession had been surgeons. The patronymic indicates a Flemish origin,\r\nand the work on English surnames* that bids the reader looking for\r\ninformation under \"Flinders\" to \"see Flanders,\" sends him on a reasonable\r\nquest, if to no great resulting advantage. (* Barker, Family Surnames\r\n1903 page 143.)\r\n\r\nThe English middle-eastern counties received frequent large migrations of\r\nFlemings during several centuries. Sometimes calamities due to the\r\nharshness of nature, sometimes persecutions and wars, sometimes adverse\r\neconomic conditions, impelled companies of people from the Low Countries\r\nto cross the North Sea and try to make homes for themselves in a land\r\nwhich, despite intervals of distraction, offered greater security and a\r\nbetter reward than did the place whence they came. England derived much\r\nadvantage from the infusion of this industrious, solid and dependable\r\nFlemish stock; though the temporary difficulty of absorption gave rise to\r\nlocal protests on more than one occasion.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1108, a great part of Flanders \"being drowned by an exudation\r\nor breaking in of the sea, a great number of Flemings came into the\r\ncountry, beseeching the King to have some void place assigned them,\r\nwherein they might inhabit.\"* (* Holinshed's Chronicle edition of 1807 2\r\n58.) Again in the reign of Edward I we find Flemish merchants carrying on\r\na very large and important trade in Boston, and representatives of houses\r\nfrom Ypres and Ostend acquired property in the town.* (* Pishey Thompson\r\nCollections for a Topographical and Historical Account of Boston and the\r\nHundred of Skirbeck 1820 page 31.) In the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, when Flanders was boiling on the fire of the Reformation,\r\nLincolnshire and Norfolk provided an asylum for crowds of harassed\r\nrefugees. In 1569 two persons were deputed to ride from Boston to Norwich\r\nto ascertain what means that city adopted to find employment for them;\r\nand in the same year Mr. William Derby was directed to move Mr. Secretary\r\nCecil, Queen Elizabeth's great minister, to \"know his pleasure whether\r\ncertain strangers may be allowed to dwell within the borough without\r\ndamage of the Queen's laws.\"* (*Boston Corporation manuscripts quoted in\r\nThompson, History and Antiquities of Boston 1856.)\r\n\r\nDuring one of these peaceful and useful Flemish invasions the ancestors\r\nof Matthew Flinders entered Lincolnshire. In the later years of his life\r\nhe devoted some attention to the history of his family, and found record\r\nof a Flinders as early as the tenth century. He believed, also, that his\r\npeople had some connection with two men named Flinders or Flanders, who\r\nfled from Holland during the religious persecutions, and settled, in\r\nQueen Elizabeth's reign, in Nottinghamshire as silk stocking weavers. It\r\nwould be very interesting if it were clear that there was a link between\r\nthe family and the origins of the great Nottingham hosiery trade. A\r\nFlinders may in that case have woven silk stockings for the Royal\r\ntermagant, and Lord Coke's pair, which were darned so often that none of\r\nthe original fabric remained, may have come from their loom.\r\n\r\nMatthew Flinders himself wrote the note: \"Ruddington near Nottingham (it\r\nis four miles south of the town) is the place whence the Flinders came;\"\r\nand he ascertained that an ancestor was Robert Flinders, a Nottingham\r\nstocking-weaver.\r\n\r\nA family tradition relates that the Lincolnshire Flinders were amongst\r\nthe people taken over to England by Sir Cornelius Vermuyden, a Dutch\r\nengineer of celebrity in his day, who undertook in 1621 to drain 360,000\r\nacres of fen in Norfolk, Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire. He was financed\r\nby English and Dutch capitalists, and took his reward in large grants of\r\nland which he made fit for habitation and cultivation. Vermuyden and his\r\nFlemings were not allowed to accomplish their work of reclamation without\r\nincurring the enmity of the natives. In a petition to the King in 1637 he\r\nstated that he had spent 150,000 pounds, but that 60,000 pounds of damage\r\nhad been done \"by reason of the opposition of the commoners,\" who cut the\r\nbanks of his channels in the night and during floods. The peasantry,\r\nindeed, resisted the improvements that have proved so beneficent to that\r\npart of England, because the draining and cultivation of so many miles of\r\nswamp would deprive them of fishing and fowling privileges enjoyed from\r\ntime immemorial. Hardly any reform or improvement can be effected without\r\nsome disruption of existing interests; and a people deeply sunk in\r\npoverty and toil could hardly be expected to contemplate with\r\nphilosophical calm projects which, however advantageous to fortunate\r\nindividuals and to posterity, were calculated to diminish their own means\r\nof living and their pleasant diversions. The dislike of the \"commoners\"\r\nto the work of the \"participants\" led to frequent riots, and many of\r\nVermuyden's Flemings were maltreated. He endeavoured to allay discontent\r\nby employing local labour at high wages; and was courageous enough to\r\npursue his task despite loss of money, wanton destruction, and many other\r\ndiscouragements.* (* See Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, for\r\n1619, 1623, 1625, 1638, 1639 et seq; and White's Lincolnshire page 542.)\r\nEbullitions of discontent on the part of fractious Fenlanders did not\r\ncease till the beginning of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nA very simple calculation shows that the great-grandfather of the first\r\nMatthew Flinders would probably have been contemporary with Sir Cornelius\r\nVermuyden's reclamation works. He may have been one of the \"participants\"\r\nwho benefited from them. The fact is significant as bearing upon this\r\nconjecture, that no person named Flinders made a will in Lincolnshire\r\nbefore 1600.* (* See C.W. Foster, Calendar of Lincoln Wills 1320 to 1600,\r\n1902.)\r\n\r\nIt is, too, an interesting circumstance that there was a Flinders among\r\nthe early settlers in New England, Richard Flinders of Salem, born 1637.*\r\n(* Savage, Genealogical Dictionary of the First Settlers of New England,\r\nBoston U.S.A. 1860.) He may have been of the same family as the\r\nnavigator, for the Lincolnshire element among the fathers of New England\r\nwas pronounced.\r\n\r\nThe name Flinders survived at Donington certainly for thirty years after\r\nthe death of the sailor who gave lustre to it; for in a directory\r\npublished in 1842 occur the names of \"Flinders, Mrs. Eliz., Market\r\nPlace,\" and \"Flinders, Mrs. Mary, Church Street.\"* (* William White,\r\nHistory, Gazetteer and Directory of the City and Diocese of Lincoln, 1842\r\npage 193.)\r\n\r\nThe Flinders papers, mentioned in the preface, contain material which\r\nenables the family and connections of the navigator to be traced with\r\ncertainty for seven generations. The genealogy is shown by the following\r\ntable:--\r\n\r\nJohn Flinders, born 1682, died 1741, settled at Donington as a farmer,\r\nmarried Mary Obray or Aubrey in 1702 and had at least 1 child:\r\n\r\nJohn Flinders, surgeon at Spalding, born 1737, still living in 1810, had\r\nat least two children:\r\n\r\n1. John Flinders, Lieutenant in the Royal Navy, born 1766, died 1793.\r\n\r\n2. Matthew Flinders, surgeon at Donington, born 1750, died 1802, married\r\nSusannah Ward, 1752 to 1783, in 1773 and had at least two children:\r\n\r\n2. Samuel Ward Flinders, born 1782, died 1842, Lieutenant in the Royal\r\nNavy, married and left several children.\r\n\r\n1. Matthew Flinders the Navigator, born March 16, 1774, died July 19,\r\n1814, married Ann Chappell, born 1770, died 1852, in 1801 and had one\r\ndaughter:\r\n\r\nAnn Flinders, born 1812, died 1892, married William Petrie, born 1821,\r\ndied 1908, in 1851 and had one son:\r\n\r\nProfessor W.M. Flinders Petrie, eminent scholar and Egyptian\r\narchaeologist, born 1853, married Hilda Urlin in 1897 and had at least\r\ntwo children:\r\n\r\n1. John Flinders Petrie.\r\n\r\n2. Ann Flinders Petrie.\r\n\r\nThere is also an interesting connection between Flinders and the\r\nTennysons, through the Franklin family. The present Lord Tennyson, when\r\nGovernor of South Australia, in the course of his official duties, in\r\nMarch, 1902, unveiled a memorial to his kinsman on Mount Lofty, and in\r\nApril of the same year a second one in Encounter Bay. The following table\r\nillustrates the relationship between him who wrote of \"the long wash of\r\nAustralasian seas\" and him who knew them as discoverer:\r\n\r\nMatthew Flinders (father of Matthew Flinders the navigator) married as\r\nhis second wife Elizabeth Weekes, whose sister, Hannah Weekes, married\r\nWillingham Franklin of Spilsby and had at least two children:\r\n\r\n1. Sir John Franklin, born 1786, midshipman of the Investigator, Arctic\r\nexplorer, Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) 1837 to\r\n1844, died 1847.\r\n\r\n2. Sarah Franklin, married Henry Sellwood, solicitor, of Horncastle, in\r\n1812 and had at least two children:\r\n\r\n2. Louisa Sellwood married Charles Tennyson-Turner, poet, brother of\r\nAlfred Tennyson.\r\n\r\n1. Emily Sarah Sellwood, born 1813, died 1896, married Alfred Tennyson,\r\nPoet Laureate, born 1809, died 1892, in 1850 and had at least one son:\r\n\r\nHallam, Lord Tennyson, born 1852; Governor of South Australia 1899 to\r\n1902; Governor-General of Australia, 1902 to 1904.\r\n\r\nThe Flinders papers also contain a note suggesting a distant connection\r\nbetween Matthew Flinders and the man who above all others was his choice\r\nfriend, George Bass, the companion of his earliest explorations. Positive\r\nproof is lacking, but Flinders' daughter, Mrs. Petrie, wrote \"we have\r\nreason to think that Bass was a connection of the family,\" and the point\r\nis too interesting to be left unstated. The following table shows the\r\npossible kinship:\r\n\r\nJohn Flinders of Donington, born 1682, died 1741 (great-grandfather of\r\nthe navigator) had:\r\n\r\nMary Flinders, third and youngest daughter, born 1734, married as her\r\nthird husband, Bass, and had:\r\n\r\nGeorge Bass, who had three daughters, and is believed to have been an\r\nuncle or cousin of George Bass, Matthew Flinders' companion in\r\nexploration.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the particulars stated above that the tree of which\r\nMatthew Flinders was the fruit had its roots deep down in the soil of the\r\nlittle Lincolnshire market town where he was born; and Matthew himself\r\nwould have continued the family tradition, inheriting the practice built\r\nup by his father and grandfather (as it was hoped he would do), had there\r\nnot been within him an irresistible longing for the sea, and a bent of\r\nscientific curiosity directed to maritime exploration, which led him on a\r\npath of discovery to achievements that won him honourable rank in the\r\nnoble roll of British naval pioneers.\r\n\r\nHis father earned an excellent reputation, both professional and\r\npersonal. The career of a country practitioner rarely affords an\r\nopportunity for distinction. It was even less so then than today, when at\r\nall events careful records of interesting cases are printed in a score or\r\nmore of professional publications. But once we find the elder Matthew\r\nFlinders in print. The Memoirs of the Medical Society of London* (* 1779\r\nVolume 4 page 330.) contain a paper read before that body on October\r\n30th, 1797: \"Case of a child born with variolar pustules, by Matthew\r\nFlinders, surgeon, Donington, Lincolnshire.\" The essay occupies three\r\npages, and is a clear, succinct record of symptoms, treatment and\r\nresults, for medical readers. The child died; whereupon the surgeon\r\nexpresses his regret, not on account of infant or parents, but, with true\r\nscientific zest, because it deprived him of the opportunity of watching\r\nthe development of an uncommon case.\r\n\r\nDonington is a small town in the heart of the fen country, lying ten\r\nmiles south-west of Boston, and about the same distance, as the crow\r\nflies, from the black, muddy, western fringe of the Wash. It is a very\r\nold town. Formerly it was an important Lincolnshire centre, enjoying its\r\nweekly Saturday market, and its four annual fairs for the sale of horses,\r\ncattle, flax and hemp. During Flinders' youth and early manhood the\r\ndistrict grew large quantities of hemp, principally for the Royal Navy.\r\nIn the days of its prosperity Donington drew to itself the business of an\r\nagricultural neighbourhood which was so far cultivable as it rose above\r\nthe level of desolate and foggy swamps. But the drainage of the fens and\r\nthe making of good roads over what had once been an area of amphibious\r\nuncertainty, neither wholly land nor wholly water, had the effect of\r\nlargely diverting business to Boston. Trade that came to Donington when\r\nit stood over its own tract of fen, like the elderly and respectable\r\ncapital of some small island, now went to the thriving and historic port\r\non the Witham. Donington stopped growing, stagnated, declined. On the map\r\nof Lincolnshire included in Camden's Britannia (1637) it is marked\r\n\"Dunington,\" in letters as large as those given to Boston, Spalding and\r\nLincoln. On modern maps the name is printed in small letters; on some in\r\nthe smallest, or not at all. That fact is fairly indicative of its change\r\nof fortunes. Figures tell the tale with precision. In 1801 it contained\r\n1321 inhabitants; in 1821, 1638; in 1841 it reached its maximum, 2026; by\r\n1891 it had gone down to 1547; in 1901 to 1484; at the census of 1911 it\r\nhad struggled up to 1564.* (* Allen, History of Lincolnshire, 1833 Volume\r\n1 342; Victoria History of Lincolnshire Volume 2 359; Census Returns for\r\n1911.)\r\n\r\nThe fame conferred by a distinguished son is hardly a recompense for\r\nfaded prosperity, but certain it is that Donington commands a wider\r\ninterest as the birthplace of Flinders than it ever did in any other\r\nrespect during its long, uneventful history. The parish church, a fine\r\nGothic building with a lofty, graceful spire, contains a monument to the\r\nmemory of the navigator, with an inscription in praise of his character\r\nand life, and recording that he \"twice circumnavigated the globe.\" Many\r\nmen have encircled the earth, but few have been so distinguished as\r\ndiscoverers of important portions of it. Apart from this monument, the\r\nchurch contains marble ovals to the memory of Matthew Flinders' father,\r\ngrandfather, and great-grandfather. They were provided from a sum of 100\r\npounds left by the navigator, in his will, for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice that three of the early Australian explorers\r\ncame from Lincolnshire, and were all born at places visible in clear\r\nweather from the tower of St. Botolph's Church at Boston. While Flinders\r\nsprang from Donington, George Bass, who co-operated with him in his first\r\ndiscoveries, was born at Aswarby, near Sleaford, and Sir John Franklin,\r\nwho sailed with him in the Investigator, and was subsequently to become\r\nan Australian Governor and to achieve a pathetic immortality in another\r\nfield of exploration, entered the world at Spilsby. Sir Joseph Banks, the\r\nbotanist of Cook's first voyage, Flinders' steadfast friend, and the\r\nearliest potent advocate of Australian colonisation, though not actually\r\nborn in Lincolnshire, was the son of a squire who at the time of his\r\nbirth owned Revesby Abbey, which is within a short ride of each of the\r\nplaces just named.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. AT SCHOOL AND AT SEA.\r\n\r\nYoung Flinders received his preparatory education at the Donington free\r\nschool. This was an institution founded and endowed in 1718 by Thomas\r\nCowley, who bequeathed property producing nowadays about 1200 pounds a\r\nyear for the maintenance of a school and almshouses. It was to be open to\r\nthe children of all the residents of Donington parish free of expense,\r\nand in addition there was a fund for paying premiums on the\r\napprenticeship of boys.\r\n\r\nAt the age of twelve the lad was sent to the Horbling Grammar School, not\r\nmany miles from his own home. It was under the direction of the Reverend\r\nJohn Shinglar. Here he remained three years. He was introduced to the\r\nLatin and Greek classics, and received the grounding of that mathematical\r\nknowledge which subsequently enabled him to master the science of\r\nnavigation without a tutor. If to Mr. Shinglar's instruction was likewise\r\ndue his ability to write good, sound, clear English, we who read his\r\nletters and published writings have cause to speak his schoolmaster's\r\nname with respect.\r\n\r\nDuring his school days another book besides those prescribed in the\r\ncurriculum came into his hands. He read Robinson Crusoe. It was to\r\nDefoe's undying tale of the stranded mariner that he attributed the\r\nawaking in his own mind of a passionate desire to sail in uncharted seas.\r\nThis anecdote happens to be better authenticated than are many of those\r\nquoted to illustrate the youth of men of mark. Towards the end of\r\nFlinders' life the editor of the Naval Chronicle sent to him a series of\r\nquestions, intending to found upon the answers a biographical sketch. One\r\nquestion was: \"Juvenile or miscellaneous anecdotes illustrative of\r\nindividual character?\" The reply was: \"Induced to go to sea against the\r\nwishes of friends from reading Robinson Crusoe.\"\r\n\r\nThe case, interesting as it is, has an exact parallel in the life of a\r\nfamous French traveller, Rene Caille, who in 1828, after years of\r\nextraordinary effort and endurance, crossed Senegal, penetrated Central\r\nAfrica, and was the first European to visit Timbuctoo. He also had read\r\nDefoe's masterpiece as a lad, and attributed to it the awaking in his\r\nbreast of a yearning for adventure and discovery. \"The reading of\r\nRobinson Crusoe,\" says a French historian, \"made upon him a profound\r\nimpression.\" \"I burned to have adventures of my own,\" he wrote later; \"I\r\nfelt as I read that there was born within my heart the ambition to\r\ndistinguish myself by some important discovery.\"* (* Gaffarel, La\r\nPolitique coloniale en France, 1908 page 34.)\r\n\r\nHere were astonishing results to follow from the vivid fiction of a gouty\r\npamphleteer who wrote to catch the market and was hoisted into immortal\r\nfame by the effort: that his book should, like a spark falling on straw,\r\nfire the brains of a French shoemaker's apprentice and a Lincolnshire\r\nschoolboy, impelling each to a career crowded with adventure, and crowned\r\nwith memorable achievements. There could hardly be better examples of the\r\nvitalising efficacy of fine literature.\r\n\r\nA love of Robinson Crusoe remained with Flinders to the end. Only a\r\nfortnight before his death he wrote a note subscribing for a copy of a\r\nnew edition of the book, with notes, then announced for publication. It\r\nmust have been one of the last letters from his hand. Though out of its\r\nchronological order, it may be appropriately quoted here to connect it\r\nwith the other references to the book which so profoundly influenced his\r\nlife:\r\n\r\n\"Captain Flinders presents his compliments to the Hydrographer of the\r\nNaval Chronicle, and will thank him to insert his home in the list of\r\nsubscribers in his new edition of Robinson Crusoe; he wishes also that\r\nthe volume on delivery should have a neat, common binding, and be\r\nlettered.--London Street, July 5, 1814.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems clear that Flinders had promised himself the pleasure of\r\nre-reading in maturity the tale that had so delighted his youth. Had he\r\nlived to do so, he might well have underlined, as applicable to himself,\r\na pair of those sententious observations with which Defoe essayed to give\r\na sober purpose to his narrative. The first is his counsel of \"invincible\r\npatience under the worst of misery, indefatigable application, and\r\nundaunted resolution under the greatest and most discouraging\r\ncircumstances.\" The second is his wise remark that \"the height of human\r\nwisdom is to bring our tempers down to our circumstances, and to make a\r\ngreat calm within under the weight of the greatest storm without.\" They\r\nwere words which Flinders during strenuous years had good cause to\r\ntranslate into conduct.\r\n\r\nThe edition of the book to which he thus subscribed was undertaken\r\nlargely on account of his acknowledgment of its effect upon his life. The\r\nauthor of the Naval Chronicle sketch of his career* (* 1814 Volume 32.)\r\nwrote in a footnote: \"The biographer, also happening to understand that\r\nto the same cause the Navy is indebted for another of its ornaments,\r\nAdmiral Sir Sydney Smythe, was in a great measure thereby led to give\r\nanother studious reading to that charming story, and hence to adopt a\r\nplan for its republication, now almost at maturity;\" and he commended the\r\nnew issue especially \"to all those engaged in the tuition of youth.\"\r\n\r\nOne other anecdote of Flinders' boyhood has been preserved as a family\r\ntradition. It is that, while still a child, he was one day lost for some\r\nhours. He was ultimately found in the middle of one of the sea marshes,\r\nhis pockets stuffed with pebbles, tracing the runlets of water, so that\r\nby following them up he might find out whence they came. Many boys might\r\nhave done the same; but this particular boy, in that act of enquiry\r\nconcerning geographical phenomena on a small scale, showed himself father\r\nto the man.\r\n\r\n\"Against the wish of friends,\" Flinders wrote, was his selection of a\r\nnaval career. His father steadily but kindly opposed his desire, hoping\r\nthat his son would adopt the medical profession. But young Matthew was\r\nnot easily thwarted. The call of the sea was strong within him, and\r\npersistency was always a fibrous element in his character.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon's house at Donington stood in the market square. It remained\r\nin existence till 1908, when it was demolished to give place to what is\r\ndescribed as \"a hideous new villa.\" It was a plain, square, one-story\r\nbuilding with a small, low surgery built on to one side of it. Behind the\r\ndoor of the surgery hung a slate, upon which the elder Flinders was\r\naccustomed to write memoranda concerning appointments and cases. The lad,\r\nwishing to let his father know how keen was his desire to enter the Navy,\r\nand dreading a conversation on the subject--with probable reproaches,\r\nadmonitions, warnings, and a general outburst of parental\r\ndispleasure--made use of the surgeon's slate. He wrote upon it what he\r\nwanted his father to know, hung it on the nail, and left it there to tell\r\nits quiet story.\r\n\r\nHe got his way in the end, but not without discouragement from other\r\nquarters also. He had an uncle in the Navy, John Flinders, to whom he\r\nwrote asking for counsel. John's experience had not made him enamoured of\r\nhis profession, and his reply was chilling. He pointed out that there was\r\nlittle chance of success without powerful interest. Promotion was slow\r\nand favouritism was rampant. He himself had served eleven years, and had\r\nnot yet attained the rank of lieutenant, nor were his hopes of rising\r\nbetter than slender.\r\n\r\nFrom the strictly professional point of view it was not unreasonable\r\nadvice for the uncle to give. A student of the naval history of the\r\nperiod finds much to justify a discouraging attitude. Even the dazzling\r\ncareer of Nelson might have been frustrated by a long protracted minority\r\nhad he not had a powerful hand to help him up the lower rungs of the\r\nladder--the \"interest\" of Captain Suckling, his uncle, who in 1775 became\r\nComptroller of the Navy, \"a civil position, but one that carried with it\r\npower and consequently influence.\" Nelson became lieutenant after seven\r\nyears' service, in 1777; but he owed his promotion to Suckling, who \"was\r\nable to exert his influence in behalf of his relative by promptly\r\nsecuring for him not only his promotion to lieutenant, which many waited\r\nfor long, but with it his commission, dated April 10, to the Lowestofte,\r\na frigate of thirty-two guns.\"* (* Mahan, Life of Nelson edition of 1899\r\npages 13 and 14.)\r\n\r\nThat even conduct of singular merit, performed in the crisis of action,\r\nwas not sufficient to secure advancement, is illustrated by a striking\r\nfact in the life of Sir John Hindmarsh, the first Governor of South\r\nAustralia (1836). At the battle of the Nile, Hindmarsh, a midshipman of\r\nfourteen, was left in charge of the Bellerophon, all the other officers\r\nbeing killed or wounded. (It was upon this same vessel, as we shall see\r\nlater, that Flinders had a taste of sea fighting). When the French\r\nline-of-battle ship L'Orient took fire she endangered the Bellerophon.\r\nThe boy, with wonderful presence of mind, called up some hands, cut the\r\ncables, and was running the ship out of danger under a sprit sail, when\r\nCaptain Darby came on deck from having his wounds dressed. Nelson,\r\nhearing of the incident, thanked young Hindmarsh before the ship's\r\ncompany, and afterwards gave him his commission in front of all hands,\r\nrelating the story to them. \"The sequel,\" writes Admiral Sir T.S. Pasley,\r\nwho relates the facts in his Journal, \"does not sound so well. Lord\r\nNelson died in 1805, and Hindmarsh is a commander still, in 1830, not\r\nhaving been made one till June, 1814.\" A man with such a record certainly\r\nhad to wait long before the sun of official favour shone upon him; and\r\nhis later success was won, not in the navy, but as a colonial governor.\r\n\r\nThere was, then, much to make John Flinders believe that influence was a\r\nsurer way to advancement than assiduous application or natural capacity.\r\nHis own naval career did not turn out happily. A very few years\r\nafterwards he received his long-delayed promotion, served as lieutenant\r\nin the Cygnet, on the West Indies station, under Admiral Affleck, and\r\ndied of yellow fever on board his ship in 1793.\r\n\r\nJohn Flinders' letter, however, concluded with a piece of practical\r\nadvice, in case his nephew should be undeterred by his opinion. He\r\nrecommended the study of three works as a preparation for entering the\r\nNavy: Euclid, John Robertson's Elements of Navigation (first edition\r\npublished in 1754) and Hamilton Moore's book on Navigation. Matthew\r\ndisregarded the warning and took the practical advice. The books were\r\nprocured and the young student plunged into their problems eagerly. The\r\nyear devoted to their study in that quiet little fen town made him master\r\nof rather more than the elements of a science which enabled him to become\r\none of the foremost discoverers and cartograhers of a continent. He\r\nprobably also practised map-making with assiduity, for his charts are not\r\nonly excellent as charts, but also singularly beautiful examples of\r\nscientific drawing.\r\n\r\nAfter a year of book-work Flinders felt capable of acquitting himself\r\ncreditably at sea, if he could secure an opportunity. In those days\r\nentrance to the Royal Navy was generally secured by the nomination of a\r\nsenior officer. There was no indispensable examination; no naval college\r\ncourse was necessary. The captain of a ship could take a youth on board\r\nto oblige his relatives, \"or in return for the cancelling of a\r\ntradesman's bill.\"* (* Masefield's Sea Life in Nelson's Time 1905 gives a\r\ngood account of the practice.) It so happened that a cousin of Flinders\r\noccupied the position of governess in the family of Captain Pasley\r\n(afterwards Admiral Sir Thomas Pasley) who at that time commanded H.M.S.\r\nScipio. One of her pupils, Maria Pasley, developed into a young lady of\r\ndecidedly vigorous character, as the following incident sufficiently\r\nshows. While her father was commander-in-chief at Plymouth, she was one\r\nday out in the Channel, beyond the Eddystone, in the Admiral's cutter. As\r\nthe country was at war, she was courting danger; and in fact, the cutter\r\nwas sighted by a French cruiser, which gave chase. But Miss Pasley\r\ndeclined to run away. She \"popped at the Frenchman with the cutter's two\r\nbrass guns.\" It was like blowing peas at an elephant; and she would\r\nundoubtedly have been captured, had not an English frigate seen the\r\ndanger and put out to the rescue.\r\n\r\nFlinders' cousin had interested herself in his studies and ambitions, and\r\ngave him some encouragement. She also spoke about him to Captain Pasley,\r\nwho seems to have listened sympathetically. It interested him to hear of\r\nthis boy studying navigation without a tutor up among the fens. \"Send for\r\nhim,\" said Pasley, \"I should like to see what stuff he is made of, and\r\nwhether he is worth making into a sailor.\"\r\n\r\nYoung Matthew, then in his fifteenth year, was accordingly invited to\r\nvisit the Pasleys. In the later part of his life he used to relate with\r\nmerriment, how he went, was asked to dine, and then pressed to stay till\r\nnext day under the captain's roof. He had brought no night attire with\r\nhim, not having expected to sleep at the house. When he was shown into\r\nhis bedroom, his needs had apparently been anticipated; for there, folded\r\nup neatly upon the pillow, was a sleeping garment ready for use. He\r\nappreciated the consideration; but having attired himself for bed, he\r\nfound himself enveloped in a frothy abundance of frills and fal-lals,\r\nlace at the wrists, lace round the neck, with flutters of ribbon here and\r\nthere. When, at the breakfast table in the morning, he related how he had\r\nbeen rigged, there was a shriek of laughter from the young ladies; the\r\nsimple explanation being that one of them had vacated her room to\r\naccommodate the visitor, and had forgotten to remove her nightdress.\r\n\r\nThe visit had more important consequences. Captain Pasley very soon saw\r\nthat he had an exceptional lad before him, and at once put him on the\r\nAlert. He was entered as \"lieutenant's servant\" on October 23rd, 1789. He\r\nremained there for rather more than seven months, learning the practical\r\npart of a sailor's business. On May 17th, 1790, he was able to present\r\nhimself to Captain Pasley on the Scipio at Chatham, as an aspirant of\r\nmore than ordinary efficiency; and remained under his command until the\r\nnext year, following him as a midshipman when he left the Scipio for the\r\nBellerophon in July, 1790.\r\n\r\nThis famous ship, which carried 74 guns, and was launched in 1786, is\r\nchiefly known to history as the vessel upon which Napoleon surrendered to\r\nCaptain Maitland on July 15th, 1815, after the Waterloo debacle. She took\r\na prominent part in Nelson's great battles at the Nile and Trafalgar. But\r\nher end was pitifully ignoble. After a glorious and proud career, she was\r\nconverted into a convict hulk and re-named the Captivity. A great prose\r\nmaster has reminded us, in words that glow upon his impassioned page, of\r\nthe slight thought given by the practical English to the fate of another\r\nline-of-battle ship that had flown their colours in the stress of war.\r\n\"Those sails that strained so full bent into the battle, that broad bow\r\nthat struck the surf aside, enlarging silently in steadfast haste full\r\nfront to the shot, those triple ports whose choirs of flame rang forth in\r\ntheir courses, into the fierce avenging monotone, which, when it died\r\naway, left no answering voice to rise any more upon the sea against the\r\nstrength of England, those sides that were wet with the long runlets of\r\nEnglish life-blood, like press-planks at vintage, gleaming goodly crimson\r\ndown to the cast and clash of the washing foam, those pale masts that\r\nstayed themselves up against the war-ruin, shaking out their ensigns\r\nthrough the thunder, till sail and ensign drooped, steeped in the\r\ndeath-stilled pause of Andalusian air, burning with its witness clouds of\r\nhuman souls at rest--surely for these some sacred care might have been\r\nleft in our thoughts, some quiet resting place amidst the lapse of\r\nEnglish waters? Nay, not so, we have stern keepers to trust her glory to,\r\nthe fire and the worm. Never more shall sunset lay golden robe on her,\r\nnor starlight tremble on the waves that part at her gliding. Perhaps,\r\nwhere the gate opens to some cottage garden, the tired traveller may ask,\r\nidly, why the moss grows so green on its rugged wood; and even the\r\nsailor's child may not answer nor know, that the night-dew lies deep in\r\nthe war-rents of the wood of the old Temeraire.\"\r\n\r\nBut even the decline of might and dignity into decrepitude and oblivion\r\ndescribed in that luminous passage is less pathetic than the conversion\r\nof the glorious Bellerophon, with her untarnished traditions of historic\r\nvictories, into a hulk for the punishment of rascals, and the changing of\r\nher unsullied name to an alias significant only of shame.\r\n\r\nDuring this preliminary period Flinders learnt the way about a ship and\r\nacquired instruction in the mechanism of seamanship, but there was as yet\r\nno opportunity to obtain deep-water experience. He was transferred to the\r\nDictator for a brief period, but as he neither mentions the captain nor\r\nalludes to any other circumstance connected therewith, it was probably a\r\nmere temporary turnover or guardship rating not to lose any time of\r\nservice.* (* Naval Chronicle 1814.)\r\n\r\nHis first chance of learning something about the width of the world and\r\nthe wonder of its remote places came in 1791, when he went to sea under\r\nthe command of a very remarkable man. William Bligh had sailed with James\r\nCook on his third and fatal voyage of discovery, 1776 to 1780. He was\r\ntwenty-three years of age when he was selected by that sagacious leader\r\nas one of those young officers who \"under my direction could be usefully\r\nemployed in constructing charts, in taking views of the coasts and\r\nheadlands near which we should pass, and in drawing plans of the bays and\r\nharbours in which we should anchor;\" for Cook recognised that constant\r\nattention to these duties was \"wholly requisite if he would render our\r\ndiscoveries profitable to future navigators.\"* (* Cook's Voyages edition\r\nof 1821 5 page 92.)\r\n\r\nBligh's name appears frequently in Cook's Journal, and is also mentioned\r\nin King's excellent narrative of the conclusion of the voyage after\r\nCook's murder. He was master of the Resolution, and was on several\r\noccasions entrusted with tasks of some consequence: as for instance on\r\nfirst reaching Hawaii, when Cook sent him ashore to look for fresh water,\r\nand again at Kealakeakura Bay (January 16, 1779) when he reported that he\r\nhad found good anchorage and fresh water \"in a situation admirable to\r\ncome at.\" It was a fatal discovery, for on the white sands of that bay, a\r\nmonth later (February 14), the great British seaman fell, speared by the\r\nsavages.\r\n\r\nOn each of Cook's voyages a call had been made at Tahiti in the Society\r\ngroup. Bligh no doubt heard much about the charms of the place before he\r\nfirst saw it himself. He was destined to have his own name associated\r\nwith it in a highly romantic and adventurous manner. The idyllic beauty\r\nof the life of the Tahitians, their amiable and seductive\r\ncharacteristics, the warm suavity of the climate, the profusion of food\r\nand drink to be enjoyed on the island with the smallest conceivable\r\namount of exertion, made the place stand out in all the narratives of\r\nCook's expeditions like a green-and-golden gem set in a turquoise sea, a\r\nlotos-land \"in which it seemed always afternoon,\" a paradise where love\r\nand plenty reigned and care and toil were not. George Forster, the German\r\nnaturalist who accompanied Cook on his second voyage, wrote of the men as\r\n\"models of masculine beauty,\" whose perfect proportions would have\r\nsatisfied the eye of Phidias or Praxiteles; of the women as beings whose\r\n\"unaffected smiles and a wish to please ensure them mutual esteem and\r\nlove;\" and of the life they led as being diversified between bathing in\r\ncool streams, reposing under tufted trees, feeding on luscious fruits,\r\ntelling tales, and playing the flute. In fact, Forster declared, they\r\n\"resembled the happy, indolent people whom Ulysses found in Phaeacia, and\r\ncould apply the poet's lines to themselves with peculiar propriety:\r\n\r\n'To dress, to dance, to sing our sole delight,\r\nThe feast or bath by day, and love by night.'\"\r\n\r\nIn Tahiti grew an abundance of breadfruit. It was in connection with this\r\nnutritious food, one of nature's richest gifts to the Pacific, that Bligh\r\nundertook a mission which involved him in a mutiny, launched him upon one\r\nof the most dangerous and difficult voyages in the annals of British\r\nseamanship, and provided a theme for a long poem by one of the greatest\r\nof English authors. Byron it was who, writing as though the trees\r\nsprouted quartern loaves ready baked, said of it (The Island 2 11):\r\n\r\n\"The bread-tree, which without the ploughshare yields\r\nThe unreaped harvest of unfurrowed fields,\r\nAnd bakes its unadulterated loaves\r\nWithout a furnace in unpurchased groves,\r\nAnd flings off famine from its fertile breast,\r\nA priceless market for the gathering guest.\"\r\n\r\nBreadfruit had been tasted and described by Dampier in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. His description of it has all the terse directness peculiar to\r\nthe writing of the inquisitive buccaneer, with a touch of quaintness that\r\nmakes the passage desirable to quote:* (* Dampier's Voyages edition of\r\n1729 1 page 294.)\r\n\r\n\"The breadfruit, as we call it, grows on a large tree as big and as tall\r\nas our largest apple trees. It hath a spreading head full of branches and\r\ndark leaves. The fruit grows on the boughs like apples; it is as big as a\r\npenny loaf when wheat is at five shillings the bushel. The natives of\r\nthis island (Suam) use it for bread. They gather it when full-grown; then\r\nthey bake it in an oven, which scorcheth the rind and makes it black; but\r\nthey scrape off the outside black crust and there remains a tender thin\r\ncrust and the inside is soft, tender and white, like the crumb of a penny\r\nloaf. There is neither seed nor stone in the inside, but all is of a pure\r\nsubstance like bread; it must be eaten new, for if it is kept above\r\ntwenty-four hours it becomes dry and eats harsh and chokey; but 'tis very\r\npleasant before it is too stale.\"\r\n\r\nBy Dampier, who in the course of his astonishing career had consumed many\r\nstrange things--who found shark's flesh \"good entertainment,\" and roast\r\nopossum \"sweet wholesome meat\"--toleration in the matter of things edible\r\nwas carried to the point of latitudinarianism. We never find Dampier\r\nsqueamish about anything which anybody else could eat with relish. To\r\nhim, naturally, the first taste of breadfruit was pleasing. But Cook was\r\nmore critical. \"The natives seldom make a meal without it,\" he said,\r\n\"though to us the taste was as disagreeable as that of a pickled olive\r\ngenerally is the first time it is eaten.\" That opinion, perhaps, accords\r\nwith the common experience of neophytes in tropical gastronomy. But new\r\nsensations in the matter of food are not always to be depended on. Sir\r\nJoseph Banks disliked bananas when he first tasted them.\r\n\r\nThe immense popularity of Cook's voyages spread afar the fame of\r\nbreadfruit as an article of food. Certain West Indian planters were of\r\nopinion that it would be advantageous to establish the trees on their\r\nislands and to encourage the consumption of the fruit by their slaves.\r\nNot only was it considered that the use of breadfruit would cheapen the\r\ncost of the slaves' living, but--a consideration that weighed both with\r\nthe planters and the British Government in view of existing relations\r\nwith the United States--it was also believed that it would \"lessen the\r\ndependence of the sugar islands on North America for food and\r\nnecessaries.\"* (* Bryan Edwards History of the British West Indies 1819 1\r\n40.)\r\n\r\nThe planters petitioned the Government to fit out an expedition to\r\ntransplant trees from the Pacific to the Atlantic. Sir Joseph Banks\r\nstrongly supported them, and Lord Hood, then First Lord of the Admiralty,\r\nwas sympathetic. In August, 1787, Lieutenant Bligh was appointed to the\r\ncommand of the Bounty, was directed to sail to the Society Islands, to\r\ntake on board \"as many trees and plants as may be thought necessary,\" and\r\nto transplant them to British possessions in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe vessel sailed, with two skilled gardeners on board to superintend the\r\nselection and treatment of the plants. Tahiti was duly reached, and the\r\nbusiness of the expedition was taken in hand. One thousand and fifteen\r\nfine trees were chosen and carefully stowed. But the comfortable\r\nindolence, the luxuriant abundance, the genial climate, the happy\r\nhospitality of the handsome islanders, and their easy freedom from\r\ncompunction in reference to restraints imposed by law and custom in\r\nEurope, had a demoralising effect upon the crew of the Bounty. A stay of\r\ntwenty-three weeks at the island sufficed to subvert discipline and to\r\npersuade some of Bligh's sailors that life in Tahiti was far preferable\r\nto service in the King's Navy under the rule of a severe and exacting\r\ncommander.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bounty left Tahiti on April 14, 1787, reluctance plucked at the\r\nheart of many of the crew. The morning light lay tenderly upon the plumes\r\nof the palms, and a light wind filled the sails of the ship as she glided\r\nout of harbour. As the lazy lapping wash of the waters against the low\r\nouter fringe of coral was lost to the ear, the Bounty breasted the deep\r\nocean; and as the distinguishable features of green tree, white sand,\r\nbrown earth, and grey rock faded out of vision, wrapped in a haze of\r\nblue, till at last the only pronounced characteristic of the island\r\nstanding up against the sky and sea was the cap of Point Venus at the\r\nnorthern extremity--the departure must have seemed to some like that of\r\nTannhauser from the enchanted mountain, except that the legendary hero\r\nwas glad to make his return to the normal world, whereas all of Bligh's\r\ncompany were not. For them, westward, whither they were bound,\r\n\r\n\"There gaped the gate\r\nWhereby lost souls back to the cold earth went.\"\r\n\r\nThe discipline of ship's life, and the stormings and objurgations of the\r\ncommanding officer, chafed like an iron collar. At length a storm burst.\r\n\r\nOn April 28 the Bounty was sailing towards Tofoa, another of the Society\r\nIslands. Just before sunrise on the following morning Bligh was aroused\r\nfrom sleep, seized and bound in his cabin by a band of mutineers, led out\r\nby the master's mate, Fletcher Christian, and, with eighteen companions,\r\ndropped into a launch and bidden to depart. The followers of Christian\r\nwere three midshipmen and twenty-five petty officers and sailors. They\r\nturned the head of the Bounty back towards their island paradise; and as\r\nthey sailed away, the mariners in the tossing little boat heard them\r\ncalling \"Hurrah for Tahiti!\"\r\n\r\nThe frail craft in which the nineteen loyalists were compelled to attempt\r\nto traverse thousands of miles of ocean, where the navigation is perhaps\r\nthe most intricate in the world, was but 23 feet long by 6 feet 9 inches\r\nbroad and 2 feet 9 inches deep. Their provisions consisted of 150 pounds\r\nof bread, 16 pieces of pork, each about two pounds in weight, six quarts\r\nof rum, six bottles of wine, and 28 gallons of water. With this scanty\r\nstock of nourishment, in so small a boat, Bligh and his companions\r\ncovered 3618 miles, crossing the western Pacific, sailing through Torres\r\nStrait, and ultimately reaching Timor.\r\n\r\nThat Bligh was somewhat deficient in tact and sympathy in handling men,\r\ncross-grained, harsh, and obstinate, is probably true. His language was\r\noften lurid, he lavished foul epithets upon his crew, and he was not\r\nreluctant to follow terms of abuse by vigorous chastisement. He called\r\nChristian a \"damned hound,\" some of the men \"scoundrels, thieves and\r\nrascals,\" and he met a respectful remonstrance with the retort: \"You\r\ndamned infernal scoundrels, I'll make you eat grass or anything you can\r\ncatch before I have done with you.\" Naval officers of the period were not\r\naddicted to addressing their men in the manner of a lady with a pet\r\ncanary. Had Bligh's language been the head and front of his offending, he\r\nwould hardly have shocked an eighteenth century fo'c'sle. But his\r\ndisposition does not seem to have bound men to him. He generated dislike.\r\nNevertheless it is credible that the explanation which he gave goes far\r\nto explain the mutiny. He held that the real cause was a species of\r\nsensuous intoxication which had corrupted his crew.\r\n\r\n\"The women of Tahiti,\" Bligh wrote, \"are handsome, mild and cheerful in\r\ntheir manners and conversation, possessed of great sensibility, and have\r\nsufficient delicacy to make them admired and loved. The chiefs were so\r\nmuch attached to our people that they rather encouraged their stay among\r\nthem than otherwise, and even made them promises of large possessions.\r\nUnder these and other attendant circumstances equally desirable, it is\r\nperhaps not so much to be wondered at, though scarcely possible to have\r\nbeen foreseen, that a set of sailors, many of them void of connections,\r\nshould be led away; especially when in addition to such powerful\r\ninducements they imagined it in their power to fix themselves in the\r\nmidst of plenty on one of the finest islands in the world, where they\r\nneed not labour, and where the allurements of dissipation are beyond\r\nanything that can be conceived...Had their mutiny been occasioned by any\r\ngrievance, either real or imaginary, I must have discovered symptoms of\r\ntheir discontent, which would have put me on my guard; but the case was\r\nfar otherwise. Christian in particular I was on the most friendly terms\r\nwith; that very day he was engaged to have dined with me; and the\r\npreceding night he excused himself from supping with me on pretence of\r\nbeing unwell, for which I felt concerned, having no suspicions of his\r\nintegrity and honour.\"\r\n\r\nSupport is given to Bligh's explanation by a statement alleged to have\r\nbeen made by Fletcher Christian a few years later, the genuineness of\r\nwhich, however, is open to serious question. If it could be accepted,\r\nChristian acquitted his commander of having contributed to the mutiny by\r\nharsh conduct. He ascribed the occurrence \"to the strong predilection we\r\nhad contracted for living in Tahiti, where, exclusive of the happy\r\ndisposition of the inhabitants, the mildness of the climate, and the\r\nfertility of the soil, we had formed certain tender connections which\r\nbanished the remembrance of old England from our breasts.\" The weight of\r\nevidence justifies the belief that Bligh, though a sailor of unequivocal\r\nskill and dauntless courage, was an unlikeable man, and that aversion to\r\nservice under him was a factor contributing to the mutiny which cannot be\r\nexplained away.\r\n\r\nBligh is the connecting link between Cook and Flinders. Bligh learned\r\nunder Cook to experience the thrilling pleasure of discovery and to\r\npursue opportunities in that direction in a scientific spirit. Flinders\r\nlearnt the same lesson under Bligh, and bettered the instruction. Cook is\r\nthe first great scientific navigator whose name is associated with the\r\nconstruction of the map of Australia; so much can be said without\r\ndisparagement of the adventurous Dutchmen who pieced together the outline\r\nof the western and northern coasts. Flinders was the second; and Bligh,\r\npupil of the one and teacher of the other, deserves a better fate than to\r\nbe remembered chiefly as a sinister figure in two historic mutinies, that\r\nof the Bounty, and that which ended his governorship of New South Wales\r\nin 1808. Much worse men have done much worse things than he, have less\r\nthat is brave, honourable, enterprising and original to their credit, and\r\nyet are remembered without ignominy. It is said by Hooker: \"as oftentimes\r\nthe vices of wicked men do cause other their commendable virtues to be\r\nabhorred, so the honour of great men's virtues is easily a cloak to their\r\nerrors.\" Bligh fell short of being a great man, but neither was he a bad\r\nman; and the merit of his achievements, both as a navigator and amid the\r\nshock of battle (especially at Copenhagen in 1801, under Nelson), must\r\nnot be overlooked, even though stern history will not permit his errors\r\nto be cloaked.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the failure of the Bounty expedition, Sir Joseph Banks\r\npressed upon the Government the desirableness of transplanting breadfruit\r\ntrees to the West Indies. He also proved a staunch friend to Bligh. The\r\nresult was that the Admiralty resolved to equip a second enterprise for\r\nthe same purpose, and to entrust the command of it to the same officer.\r\n\r\nWe may now follow the fortunes of Matthew Flinders under the tutelage of\r\nthis energetic captain.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. A VOYAGE UNDER BLIGH.\r\n\r\nBligh's second expedition was authorised by the admiralty in March, 1791,\r\nand the commander was consulted as to \"what sort of vessel may be best\r\nadapted to the object in view.\" The Providence, a 28-gun ship, was\r\nchosen, with the brig Assistant as a tender. The latter was placed in\r\ncharge of Lieutenant Nathaniel Portlock. Flinders, eager for sea\r\nexperience, joined the Providence as a midshipman on May 8th, and thus\r\nhad the advantage of being under the immediate direction of her captain.\r\n\r\nHe took this step with Pasley's concurrence, if not actually upon his\r\nadvice. The captain wrote him an encouraging letter asking him to send\r\nfrom time to time observations on places visited during the voyage; and\r\nhis protege complied with the injunction. It is to this fact that we owe\r\nsome entertaining passages from young Flinders' pen concerning the\r\nvoyage. The letters despatched to Pasley are lost; but Flinders, with the\r\nlove of neatness which was ever characteristic of him, sent only fair\r\ncopies, and some of his original drafts remain in manuscript. Pasley's\r\nletter was as follows:* (*Flinders' Papers.)\r\n\r\nBellerophon, Spithead, June 3rd, 1791.\r\n\r\nDear Flinders,\r\n\r\nI am favoured with your letter on your return from visiting your friends\r\nat the country, and I am pleased to hear that you are so well satisfied\r\nwith your situation on board the Providence. I have little doubt of your\r\ngaining the good opinion of Capt. Bligh, if you are equally attentive to\r\nyour duty there as you were in the Bellerophon. All that I have to\r\nrequest in return for the good offices I have done you is that you never\r\nfail writing me by all possible opportunities during your voyage; and\r\nthat in your letters you will be very particular and circumstantial in\r\nregard to every thing and place you may chance to see or visit, with your\r\nown observations thereon. Do this, my young friend, and you may rest\r\nassured that my good offices will not be wanting some future day for your\r\nadvancement. All on board are well. Present my kind remembrances to\r\nCaptain and Mrs. Bligh, and believe me, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nTHOMAS PASLEY.\r\n\r\nThe Providence and Assistant left England on August 2nd. From Santa Cruz\r\nin Teneriffe Flinders sent his first letter to Captain Pasley. It is\r\nworth while to quote a few passages:* (* Flinders' Papers.)\r\n\r\n\"Not a large town; streets wide, ill-paved and irregular. The houses of\r\nthe principal inhabitants large; have little furniture, but are airy and\r\npleasant, suitable to the climate. Most of them have balconies, where the\r\nowners sit and enjoy the air. Those of the lower classes ill-built,\r\ndirty, and almost without furniture. In the square where the market is\r\nheld, near the pier, is a tolerably elegant marble obelisk in honour of\r\nour Lady of Candelaria, the tutelar goddess of the place. The Spaniards\r\nerected this statue, calling it Our Lady, keeping up some semblance of\r\nthe ancient worship that they might better keep the Tenerifeans in\r\nsubjection. At the top of the obelisk is placed the statue, and at its\r\nbase are four well executed figures, representing the ancient kings or\r\nprinces of Teneriffe, each of which has the shin-bone of a man's leg in\r\nhis hand. This image is held in great honour by the lower classes of\r\npeople, who tell many absurd stories of its first appearance in the\r\nisland, the many miracles she has wrought, etc.\r\n\r\n\"We visited a nunnery of the order of St. Dominic. In the chapel was a\r\nfine statue of the Virgin Mary, with four wax candles burning before her.\r\nPeeping through the bars, we perceived several fine young women at\r\nprayers. A middle-aged woman opened the door halfway, but would by no\r\nmeans suffer us to enter this sanctified spot. None of the nuns would be\r\nprevailed upon to come near us. However, they did not seem at all\r\ndispleased at our visit, but presented us with a sweet candy they call\r\nDulce, and some artificial flowers, in return for which Mr. Smith* (* The\r\nbotanist.) gave them a dollar. In general these people appear to be a\r\nmerry, good-natured people, and are courteous to and appear happy to see\r\nstrangers. We found this always the case, although they said we were no\r\nChristians: but they generally took care to make us pay well for what we\r\nhad. They live principally upon fruits and roots, are fond of singing and\r\ndancing, and upon the whole they live as lazily, as contentedly, and in\r\nas much poverty as any French peasant would wish to do.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cape of Good Hope was reached in October, and Flinders told Captain\r\nPasley what he thought of the Dutch colonists:\r\n\r\n\"The Dutch, from having great quantities of animal food, are rather\r\ncorpulent. Nevertheless they keep up their national characteristic for\r\ncarefulness. Neither are they very polite. A stranger will be treated\r\nwith a great deal of ceremony, but when you come to the solid part of a\r\ncompliment their generosity is at a stand. Of all the people I ever saw\r\nthese are the most ceremonious. Every man is a soldier and wears his\r\nsquare-rigged hat, sword, epaulets, and military uniform. They never pass\r\neach other without a formal bow, which even descends to the lowest ranks,\r\nand it is even seen in the slaves.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 10th, 1792, Bligh's ships anchored at Tahiti, where they\r\nremained till July 19th. There was no disturbance this time, and the\r\nrelations between Bligh and his crew were not embarrassed by the\r\nindulgent kindness of the islanders. Their hospitality was not deficient,\r\nbut a wary vigilance was exercised.\r\n\r\nAt Tahiti Bligh found the major part of the crew of a whaler, the\r\nMatilda, which had been wrecked about six days' sail from the island.\r\nSome of the men accepted passages on the Providence and the Assistant;\r\nsome preferred to remain with the natives; one or two had already\r\ndeparted in one of the lost ship's boats to make their way to Sydney.* (*\r\nThis incident is reported in the Star, a London newspaper, March 2nd,\r\n1793.) Two male Tahitians were persuaded to accompany the expedition,\r\nwith a view to their exhibition before the Royal Society, in England,\r\nwhen at length, laden with 600 breadfruit trees, it sailed for the West\r\nIndies.\r\n\r\nThe route followed from the Friendly Islands to the Caribbean Sea was not\r\nvia Cape Horn (since that cold and stormy passage would have destroyed\r\nevery plant), but back across the Pacific, through Torres Strait to\r\nTimor, thence across the Indian Ocean and round the Cape of Good Hope.\r\nSt. Helena was reached on December 17, and Bligh brought his ships safely\r\nto Kingston, St. Vincent's, on January 13th 1793. Three hundred\r\nbreadfruit trees were landed at that island, and a like number taken to\r\nJamaica. The plants were in excellent condition, some of them eleven feet\r\nhigh, with leaves 36 inches long. The gardener in charge reported to Sir\r\nJoseph Banks that the success of the transplantations \"exceeded the most\r\nsanguine expectation.\" The sugar planters were delighted, and voted Bligh\r\n500 pounds for his services.* (* Southey, History of the West Indies,\r\n1827 3 61.) To accentuate the contrast between the successful second\r\nexpedition and the lamentable voyage of the Bounty, it is notable that\r\nonly one case of sickness occurred on the way, and that from Kingston it\r\nwas reported that \"the healthy appearance of every person belonging to\r\nthe expedition is remarkable.\"* (* Annual Register 1793 page 6.)\r\n\r\nBut though nothing in the nature of a mutiny marred the voyage, Flinders'\r\njournal shows that Bligh's harshness occasioned discontent. There was a\r\nshortness of water on the run from the Pacific to the West Indies, and as\r\nthe breadfruit plants had to be watered, and their safe carriage was the\r\nmain object of the voyage, the men had to suffer. Flinders and others\r\nused to lick the drops that fell from the cans to appease their thirst,\r\nand it was considered a great favour to get a sip. The crew thought they\r\nwere unfairly treated, and somebody mischievously watered some plants\r\nwith sea-water. When Bligh discovered the offence, he flew into a rage\r\nand \"longed to flog the whole company.\" But the offender could not be\r\ndiscovered, and the irate captain had to let his passion fret itself out.\r\n\r\nBligh published no narrative of this expedition; but Flinders was already\r\naccustoming himself to keep careful notes of his observations. Twenty\r\nyears later, when preparing the historical introduction to his Voyage to\r\nTerra Australis, he wrote out from his journal (and with Bligh's sanction\r\npublished) an account of the passage of the Providence and Assistant\r\nthrough Torres Strait, as a contribution to the history of navigation and\r\ndiscovery in that portion of Australasia. From the Pacific to the Indian\r\nOcean the passage was accomplished in nineteen days. \"Perhaps,\" commented\r\nFlinders, \"no space of 3 1/2 degrees in length presents more dangers than\r\nTorres Strait, but with caution and perseverance the captains, Bligh and\r\nPortlock, proved them to be surmountable, and within a reasonable time.\"\r\nBligh's Entrance and Portlock Reef, marked on modern charts, are\r\nreminders of a feat of navigation which even nowadays, with the dangers\r\naccurately described, and the well-equipped Torres Strait pilot service\r\nto aid them, mariners recognise as pregnant with serious risks. On this\r\noccasion it was also attended with incidents which make it worth while to\r\nutilise Flinders' notes, since they are of some biographical importance.\r\n\r\nThe high lands of the south-eastern extremity of Papua (New Guinea), were\r\npassed on August 30th, and at dusk on the following day breakers\r\n\"thundering on the reef\" were sighted ahead. On September 1st the vessels\r\nedged round the north end of Portlock Reef. Thence the monotonous record\r\nof soundings, shoals, reefs seen and charted, passages tried and\r\nabandoned, in the prolonged attempt to negotiate a clear course through\r\nthe baffling coral barrier, is relieved by the story of one or two sharp\r\nbrushes with armed Papuans in their long, deftly-handled canoes. On\r\nSeptember 5th, while boats were out investigating a supposed passage near\r\nDarnley Island, several large canoes shot into view. One of these, in\r\nwhich were fifteen \"Indians,\" black and quite naked, approached the\r\nEnglish cutter, and made signs which were interpreted to be amicable. The\r\nofficer in charge, however, suspecting treacherous intentions, did not\r\nthink it prudent to go near enough to accept a green cocoanut held up to\r\nhim, and kept his men rowing for the ship. Thereupon a native sitting on\r\nthe shed erected in the centre of the canoe, called a direction to the\r\nPapuans below him, who commenced to string their bows. The officer\r\nordered his men to fire in self-defence, and six muskets were discharged.\r\n\r\n\"The Indians fell flat into the bottom of the canoe, all except the man\r\non the shed. The seventh musket was fired at him, and he fell also.\r\nDuring this time the canoe dropped astern; and, the three others having\r\njoined her, they all gave chase to the cutter, trying to cut her off from\r\nthe ship; in which they would probably have succeeded, had not the\r\npinnace arrived at that juncture to her assistance. The Indians then\r\nhoisted their sails and steered for Darnley Island.\" Flinders had watched\r\nthe encounter from the deck of the Providence, and his seaman's word of\r\nadmiration for the skill of the savages in the management of their\r\ncanoes, is notable. \"No boats could have been manoeuvred better in\r\nworking to windward, than were these canoes of the naked savages. Had the\r\nfour been able to reach the cutter, it is difficult to say whether the\r\nsuperiority of our arms would have been equal to the great difference of\r\nnumbers, considering the ferocity of these people and the skill with\r\nwhich they seemed to manage their weapons.\"\r\n\r\nFive days later, between Dungeness and Warrior Islands, there was a\r\nlivelier encounter. A squadron of canoes attacked both ships in a daring\r\nand vigorous fashion. The Assistant was pressed with especial severity,\r\nso that Portlock had to signal for help. A volley of musketry had little\r\neffect upon the Papuans; and when one wing of the attacking squadron,\r\nnumbering eight canoes, headed for the Providence, and a musket was fired\r\nat the foremost, the natives responded with a great shout and paddled\r\nforward in a body.\" Bligh had one of the great guns of the ship loaded\r\nwith round and grape shot, and fired fair into the first of the long\r\nPapuan war canoes, which were full of savage assailants. The round shot\r\nraked the whole length of the craft, and struck the high stern. Men from\r\nother canoes, with splendid bravery, leaped into the water, and swam to\r\nthe assistance of their comrades, \"plunging constantly to avoid the\r\nmusket balls which showered thickly about them.\" So hard was the attack\r\npressed, that three of the Assistant's crew were wounded, one afterwards\r\ndying; and \"the depth to which the arrows penetrated into the decks and\r\nsides of the brig was reported to be truly astonishing.\" But bows and\r\narrows, on this as on many another occasion, were no match for gunnery;\r\nso that, after a hot peppering, the Papuans gave up the fight, paddling\r\nback to a safe distance as fast as they could, without exposing\r\nthemselves to fire. They rallied beyond reach of musket balls, as though\r\nfor a second onslaught, but a shot fired over their heads from the\r\nProvidence served to convince them of the hopelessness of their\r\nendeavour, and they abandoned it.\r\n\r\nAn incident not without heroic pathos is recorded by Flinders. One native\r\nwas left sitting alone in the canoe which the gun-shot of the Providence\r\nhad raked and splintered. The men in the canoes which had made good their\r\nflight observed their solitary companion, and some of them returned to\r\nhim; whereafter \"with glasses, signals were perceived to be made by the\r\nIndians to their friends on Dungeness Island, expressive, as was thought,\r\nof grief and consternation.\" Whether the lone warrior was too severely\r\nwounded to be moved, or whether he was some Papuan Casabianca clinging to\r\nhis shattered craft \"whence all but he had fled\" or been killed, or\r\nhurled into the sea, we are not told. But that canoe had been foremost in\r\nattack, perhaps the flagship of the squadron; and the memory of that\r\nsolitary warrior still sitting upon the floating wreck while his defeated\r\ncompanions returned to him, and then left him, to explain his case with\r\ngestures of grief to those on the island, clings to the memory of the\r\nreader, as it did to that of the young observer and historian of the\r\nencounter.\r\n\r\nNo more natives were seen during the passage through Torres Strait, nor\r\nwere there other incidents to enliven the narrative, unless we include\r\nthe formal \"taking possession of all the islands seen in the Strait for\r\nHis Britannic Majesty George III, with the ceremonies used on such\r\noccasions\" (September 16). The name bestowed upon the whole group of\r\nislands was Clarence's Archipelago.\r\n\r\nFlinders described the natives whom he saw carefully and accurately; and\r\nhis account of their boats, weapons, and mode of warfare is concise and\r\ngood. Some friendly Darnley Islanders were described as stoutly made,\r\nwith bushy hair; the cartilage between the nostrils cut away; the lobes\r\nof the ears split, and stretched \"to a good length.\" \"They had no kind of\r\nclothing, but wore necklaces of cowrie shells fastened to a braid of\r\nfibres; and some of their companions had pearl-oyster shells hung round\r\ntheir necks. In speaking to each other, their words seemed to be\r\ndistinctly pronounced. Their arms were bows, arrows, and clubs, which\r\nthey bartered for every kind of iron work with eagerness, but appeared to\r\nset little value on anything else. The bows are made of split bamboo, and\r\nso strong that no man in the ship could bend one of them. The string is a\r\nbroad slip of cane fixed to one end of the bow; and fitted with a noose\r\nto go over the other end when strung. The arrow is a cane of about four\r\nfeet long, into which a pointed piece of the hard, heavy, casuarina wood\r\nis firmly and neatly fitted; and some of them were barbed. Their clubs\r\nare made of casuarina, and are powerful weapons. The hand part is\r\nindented, and has a small knob, by which the firmness of the grasp is\r\nmuch assisted; and the heavy end is usually carved with some device. One\r\nhad the form of a parrots head, with a ruff round the neck, and was not\r\nill done.\r\n\r\n\"Their canoes are about fifty feet in length, and appear to have been\r\nhollowed out of a single tree; and the pieces which form the gunwales are\r\nplanks sewed on with fibres of the cocoanut and secured with pegs. These\r\nvessels are low forward, but rise abaft; and, being narrow, are fitted\r\nwith an outrigger on each side to keep them steady. A raft, of greater\r\nbreadth than the canoe, extends over about half the length, and upon this\r\nis fixed a shed or hut, thatched with palm leaves. These people, in\r\nshort, appeared to be dexterous sailors and formidable warriors, and to\r\nbe as much at ease in the water as in their canoes.\"\r\n\r\nOn September 19th the two ships, with caution and perseverance, had\r\nthreaded their dangerous way through the intricate maze of reefs and\r\nshoals of Torres Strait, and found open sea to the westward. In latitude\r\n10 degrees 8 1/2 minutes \"no land was in sight, nor did anything more\r\nobstruct Captain Bligh and his associates in their route to the island\r\nTimor.\"\r\n\r\nIt is easy to imagine the delight with which these experiences thrilled\r\nthe young midshipman on the Providence. His eighteenth birthday was spent\r\nin the Pacific, in the early Autumn of a hemisphere where the sea was not\r\nyet cloven by innumerable keels, and where beauty, enchantment and\r\nmystery lay upon life and nature like a spell. A few years previously he\r\nhad been a schoolboy in the flattest, most monotonous of English shires.\r\nBroad fields, dykes and fen had composed the landscape most familiar to\r\nhis eye. In these surroundings he had dreamed, as a boy will, of\r\npalm-fanned islands in distant climes, of adventures with savage peoples,\r\nof strange seas where great fishes are, and where romance touches all\r\nthat is with its purple light. Far horizons steeped in marvels had\r\nbounded the vision of his imagining eye. His passion was to see and do in\r\nrealms at the back of the sunrise. He wanted to sail and explore in parts\r\nrepresented by blank spaces on the map.\r\n\r\nThese dreams of the boy, basking with Robinson Crusoe under remote skies,\r\nwere suddenly translated into a reality as dazzling-bright and wonderful\r\nas anything pictured in pages often and fondly conned. This was his first\r\nvoyage, and he was serving under a commander who had lived the romance\r\nthat other men wrote and read about, who was himself a living part of an\r\nadventure whose story will be told and re-told to the centuries, and who\r\nhad served under as great and noble a captain as ever trod an English\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nThe very nature of the voyage was bound to stimulate that \"passion for\r\nexploring new countries,\" to use Flinders' own phrase, the hope for which\r\nwas a strong factor in prompting him to choose the sea as a career. It\r\nwas a voyage whose primary object involved a stay in two of the loveliest\r\nregions on the earth, the paradise of the Pacific and the gem-like\r\nAntilles. The pride and pleasure of participation in discovery were his\r\nforthwith. A new passage through an intricate and dangerous Strait was\r\nfound and charted; a whole archipelago was delineated, named, and taken\r\npossession of for the British nation. The world's knowledge was\r\nincreased. There was something put down on the map which was not there\r\nbefore. The contact with the islanders in the Strait gave a brisk element\r\nof adventure to the expedition; and certainly Papuan warriors are foes as\r\nwild and weird as any adventurer can desire to meet. The rescuing of\r\nwrecked mariners at Tahiti added a spice of adventure of another sort.\r\nFrom beginning to end, indeed, this voyage must have been as full of\r\ncharm as of utility.\r\n\r\nThe effect it had upon the future life of Matthew Flinders was very\r\nstriking. The whole of the salient features of his later career follow\r\nfrom it. He made the most of his opportunities. Captain Bligh found him a\r\nclever assistant in the preparation of charts and in making astronomical\r\nobservations. Indeed, says an expert writer, although Flinders was as yet\r\n\"but a juvenile navigator, the latter branch of scientific service and\r\nthe care of the timekeepers were principally entrusted to him.\"* (* Naval\r\nChronicle Volume 32 180.) These facts indicate that he was applying\r\nhimself seriously to the scientific side of his profession, and that he\r\nhad won the confidence of a captain who was certainly no over-indulgent\r\ncritic of subordinates.\r\n\r\nThe Providence and the Assistant returned to England in the latter part\r\nof 1793. Before Flinders once more sighted the Australian coastline he\r\nwas to experience the sensations of battle, and to take a small part in\r\nthe first of the series of naval engagements connected with the\r\nRevolutionary and Napoleonic era.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. THE BATTLE OFF BREST.\r\n\r\nWhen Bligh's expedition returned, Europe was staggering under the shock\r\nof the French Revolution. The head of Louis XVI was severed in January;\r\nthe knife of Charlotte Corday was plunged into the heart of Marat in\r\nJuly; Marie Antoinette, the grey discrowned Queen of thirty-eight,\r\nmounted the scaffold in October. The guillotine was very busy, and France\r\nwas frantic amid internal disruption and the menace of a ring of foes.\r\n\r\nThe English governing classes had been clamouring for war. It seemed to\r\nmany political observers that it was positively needful to launch the\r\ncountry into an international struggle to divert attention from demands\r\nfor domestic reform. \"Democratic ambition was awakened; the desire of\r\npower, under the name of reform, was rapidly gaining ground among the\r\nmiddling ranks; the only mode of checking the evil was by engaging in a\r\nforeign contest, by drawing off the ardent spirits into active service\r\nand, in lieu of the modern desire for innovation, rousing the ancient\r\ngallantry of the British people.\"* (* Alison, History of Europe, 1839 2\r\n128.) French military operations in the Netherlands, running counter to\r\ntraditional British policy, were provocative, and the feeling aroused by\r\nthe execution of Louis immediately led Pitt's ministry to order the\r\nFrench Ambassador, Chauvelin, to leave London within eight days. He left\r\nat once. On February 1st, acting on Chauvelin's report of the disposition\r\nand preparations of Great Britain, France formally declared war.\r\n\r\nFlinders was with Bligh, peacefully landing breadfruit trees in the West\r\nIndies, when this momentous opening of a twenty-two years' conflict\r\noccurred. When the expedition reached England, every port and dockyard on\r\nthe south coast was humming with preparations for a great naval struggle.\r\nThe Channel Fleet, under Lord Howe's command, was cruising in search of\r\nthe enemy's ships of war. Flinders' patron, Pasley, who had hoisted his\r\nbroad pennant as commodore on the Bellerophon, was actively engaged in\r\nthis service. In October, 1793, he was detached by Howe to look for five\r\nFrench vessels that had some time before chased the British frigate Circe\r\ninto Falmouth. Howe himself, with a fleet of 22 sail, put to sea later in\r\nthe same month. On November 18 his squadron sighted six French ships of\r\nthe line and some frigates, and gave chase. But they were seen late in\r\nthe day, and soon darkness prevented an engagement. On the following\r\nmorning the enemy was again sighted by the chasing squadron under Pasley;\r\nbut the Latona signalled that the French were in superior strength, and\r\nthe British detachment retired.* (* James, Naval History, 1837 1 60.)\r\nHowe's cruise was barren of results, and the British fleet returned to\r\nTorbay. Naval operations were suspended for several months.\r\n\r\nFlinders naturally took advantage of the earliest opportunity to report\r\nhimself to the friend who had first helped him into the King's Navy.\r\nPasley, who was promoted on April 12th, 1794, to the rank of Rear-Admiral\r\nof the White, again welcomed him on board the Bellerophon and, hearing\r\nfrom Captain Bligh excellent accounts of his diligence and usefulness,\r\nappointed him one of his aides-de-camp. It was in this capacity that he\r\ntook part in the great battle off Brest on June 1st, 1794, signalised in\r\nBritish naval history as \"the glorious First of June.\"\r\n\r\nLord Howe, with the Channel Fleet (thirty-four ships of the line and\r\nfifteen frigates) put to sea on May 2nd with two purposes: first, to\r\nconvoy to a safe distance from the probable field of hostilities a\r\nsquadron of 148 British merchantmen bound for various ports; second, to\r\nintercept and destroy a French fleet which was known to be convoying a\r\nlarge company of provision-ships from America. War, bad harvests, the\r\ndisorganization of industry, and revolutionary upheavals, had produced an\r\nacute scarcity of food in France, and the arrival of these vessels was\r\nawaited with intense anxiety. To prevent their arrival, or to destroy the\r\nFrench squadron, would be to strike a serious blow at the enemy. Howe had\r\nunder him a fleet eager for fight; against him, a foe keenly aware how\r\nvitally necessary to their country was the arrival of the food-ships.\r\n\r\nThe French fleet (twenty-six ships of the line) under the command of\r\nVillaret-Joyeuse, put to sea from Brest on May 16. Some foggy days\r\nintervened. On the 28th Howe sighted them. The French admiral formed his\r\nships in a close line. Howe's plan was first to get his fleet to windward\r\nof the enemy, then to sail down, pierce his line, and engage his vessels\r\nto leeward.\r\n\r\nThe Bellerophon was in action shortly after coming within striking\r\ndistance, on the 28th May. Pasley, at six o'clock in the evening,\r\nattacked the French rear, his immediate antagonist being the\r\nRevolutionnaire, 110 guns. A hot duel, maintained with splendid\r\nintrepidity by the British rear-admiral, continued for over an hour and a\r\nquarter, for the other ships of the British fleet were unable to get up\r\nto support the fast-sailing Bellerophon. She was severely handled by her\r\nlarge antagonist, and was hampered in her ability to manoeuvre by a shot\r\nwhich injured her mainmast. Pasley therefore, on a signal from the\r\nAdmiral, bore up. The Revolutionnaire was now attacked from a distance by\r\nthe Russell, the Marlborough and the Thunderer, and endeavoured to make\r\noff, but was blocked by the Leviathan. The Audacious (74) took up the\r\nwork which the Bellerophon had commenced, and, laying herself on the lee\r\nquarter of the Revolutionnaire, poured a rain of shot into her. The fight\r\nwas continued in a rough sea far into the twilight of that early summer\r\nevening; until, about 10 o'clock, the Revolutionnaire was a mere floating\r\nhulk. Her flag had either been lowered or shot down, but she was not\r\ncaptured, and was towed into Rochefort on the following day. The\r\nAudacious was so badly knocked about that she was of no use for later\r\nengagements, and was sent home.\r\n\r\nThis was Matthew Flinders' first taste of war.\r\n\r\nHowe's plan for the big battle that was imminent involved much\r\nmanoeuvring, and, as Nelson wrote in his celebrated \"plan of attack\"\r\nbefore Trafalgar, \"a day is soon lost in that business.\" The British\r\nmanoeuvred to get the weather gauge; Villaret-Joyeuse to keep it. On May\r\n29th Howe in the Queen Charlotte pierced the French line with two other\r\nships, the Bellerophon and the Leviathan, and there was some fighting.\r\nThe Bellerophon got to windward of the enemy by passing in front of the\r\nFrench Terrible (110), and put in some excellent gunnery practice. She\r\nsailed so close to the French ship to starboard as almost to touch her,\r\nand brought down the enemy's topmast and lower yards with a broadside,\r\nwhilst at the same time she raked the Terrible with her larboard guns.*\r\n(* There is an interesting engraving of the Bellerophon passing through\r\nthe French line and firing both her broadsides in the Naval Chronicle\r\nVolume 1, and a plan of the manoeuvre, showing the course of the\r\nBellerophon, in James's Naval History.)\r\n\r\nMay 30 and 31 were foggy days, and neither fleet could see the other. On\r\nJune 1st there was a blue sky, a brilliant sun, a lively sea, and a wind\r\nthat favoured the plans of the British Admiral. The signal for close\r\naction was flown from the masthead of the Queen Charlotte. Howe ordered\r\nhis ships to sail on an oblique course down upon the French line, the two\r\nfleets having during the night lain in parallel lines stretching east and\r\nwest. The intention was to break the French line near the centre, each\r\nBritish captain sailing round the stern of his antagonist, and fighting\r\nher to leeward, thus concentrating the attack on the enemy's rear,\r\ncutting it off from the van, and preventing flight.\r\n\r\nThe Bellerophon was the second ship in the British line, next after the\r\nCaesar. Flinders was upon the quarterdeck as she steered through her\r\nselected gap, which was on the weather quarter of the Eole; and an\r\nanecdote of his behaviour on that memorable occasion fortunately\r\nsurvives. The guns on the quarterdeck were loaded and primed ready for\r\nuse, but Pasley did not intend to fire them until he had laid himself on\r\nthe lee of his chosen adversary, and could pour a broadside into her with\r\ncrushing effect. There was a moment when the gunners were aloft trimming\r\nsails. As the Bellerophon was passing close under the stern of the French\r\nthree-decker--within musket-shot, James says--* (* Naval History 1 154.)\r\nFlinders seized a lighted match and rapidly fired as many of the\r\nquarterdeck guns as would plump shot fairly into her.* (* Naval Chronicle\r\n32 180.) Pasley saw him and, shaking him by the collar, said, sternly:\r\n\"How dare you do that, youngster, without my orders?\" Flinders replied\r\nthat he \"thought it a fine chance to have a shot at 'em.\" So it was,\r\nthough not in conformity with orders; and probably Pasley, as good a\r\nfighter as there was in the fleet, liked his young aide-de-camp rather\r\nthe more for his impetuous action.\r\n\r\nThe guns of the Bellerophon were opened upon the Eole at 8.45, and\r\nbattered her severely. The British vessel was subjected in turn, however,\r\nnot only to the fire of her chosen victim, but also to that of the\r\nTrajan. At ten minutes to eleven o'clock a shot from the Eole took off\r\nPasley's leg, and he was carried down to the cockpit, whereupon the\r\ncommand devolved upon Captain William Hope. It must have been a\r\ndistressing moment for Flinders, despite the intense excitement of\r\naction, when his friend and commander fell; it was indeed, as will be\r\nseen, a crucial moment in his career. A doggerel bard of the time\r\nenshrined the event in a verse as badly in need of surgical aid as were\r\nthe heroes whom it celebrates:\r\n\r\n\"Bravo, Bowyer, Pasley, Captain Hutt,\r\nEach lost a leg, being sorely hurt;\r\nTheir lives they valued but as dirt,\r\nWhen that their country called them!\"*\r\n\r\n(* Naval Songs and Ballads, Publications of the Navy Record Society,\r\nVolume 33 270.)\r\n\r\nThe fight was continued with unflagging vigour, in the absence of the\r\ngallant rear-admiral, who, as another lyrist of the event informs us,\r\nsmiled and said:\r\n\r\n\"Fight on my lads and try\r\nTo make these rebel Frenchmen know\r\nThat British courage still will flow\r\nTo make them strike or die.\"\r\n\r\nAt a quarter before noon the Eole had received such a hammering that she\r\nendeavoured to wear round under shelter of her leader; but in doing so\r\nshe lost mainmast and foretopmast. The Bellerophon, too, had by this time\r\nbeen sufficiently hard hit to cause Hope to signal to the Latona for\r\nassistance. Her foretopmast and maintopmast had gone, and her mainmast\r\nwas so badly damaged as to be dangerous. Her rigging was cut to pieces,\r\nall her boats were smashed, and she was practically as crippled as was\r\nher brave commander, upon whom the surgeons had been operating down\r\nbelow, amid the blood of the cockpit and the thunder and smoke of the\r\ncannon.\r\n\r\nThe battle ended about 1 p.m. The French fleet was badly beaten, and\r\nVillaret-Joyeuse at the end of the day drew back to Brest only a\r\nbattered, splintered and ragged remnant of the fine squadron which he had\r\ncommanded. Still, the French provision ships slipped by and arrived\r\nsafely in port. The squadron had been sent out to enable them to get in,\r\nand in they were, though it had cost a fleet to get them in. Nelson used\r\nthe phrase \"a Lord Howe victory\" disparagingly. Nothing short of a\r\ncomplete smashing of the enemy and the utter frustration of his purposes\r\nwould ever satisfy that ardent soul.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of clearness, the general scheme of the battle has been\r\ndescribed, together with the part played in it by the Bellerophon; but we\r\nfortunately have a detailed account of it by Flinders himself. Young as\r\nhe was, only a few weeks over 20 years of age, he was evidently cool, and\r\nhis journal is crowded with carefully observed facts, noted amidst the\r\nheat and confusion of conflict; and it is doubtful whether there is in\r\nexistence a better story of this important fleet action. The manuscript\r\nof his journal occupies forty foolscap pages. It is much damaged by\r\nsea-water, the paper in some parts having been rendered quite pulpy. But\r\nthe sheets relating to the 1st of June are entirely legible. As the\r\nreader will see, there is here no rhetoric, no excited use of vivid\r\nadjectives to give colour to the story. It is a calmly observed piece of\r\nhistory. Read attentively, it enables one to live through the stirring\r\nevents with which it deals in a singularly thrilling style. We feel the\r\ncrash and thunder and hustle of battle far more keenly from the detailed\r\naccumulation of occurrences here presented than any scene-painting prose\r\ncould make us do. The journal begins on September 7th, 1793, when\r\nFlinders joined the Bellerophon, and continues till August 10th, 1794,\r\nwhen he quitted her. In the early part it deals principally with cruising\r\nup and down the Channel looking for the enemy's ships. Occasionally there\r\nwas a skirmish. We may select a few instances from this period, before\r\ncoming to what immediately preceded the great day:\r\n\r\n\"Wednesday, 11th (September, 1793) a.m. Hoisted a broad pennant by order\r\nof Lord Howe, Capt.\r\nPasley being appointed a commodore of the fleet. Weighed and anchored in\r\nour station in Torbay.\r\n\r\n\"Monday, November 18th.* (* See note below.) Saw nine or ten sail,\r\nseemingly large ships, standing towards us. The admiral made the Russell\r\nand Defence signals to chase, also the Audacious; and soon after ours. By\r\nthis time the strange ships had brought to, hull down, to windward,\r\nseemingly in some confusion. The Ganges' signal was also made to chase.\r\nAt 9 the Admiral made the sign for the strange fleet being an enemy, and\r\nfor our sternmost ships to make more sail. At 10 the signal to engage as\r\nthe other ships came up was made. The enemy had now hauled their wind,\r\nand standing from us with as much sail as they could carry. Split one\r\njib; got another bent as fast as possible. We were now the headmost line\r\nof battle ship and gaining fast upon the enemy; but the main part of our\r\nfleet seemed rather to drop from them. St. Agnes north 34 degrees east 89\r\nmiles. Ship all clear for action since 9 o'clock.\r\n\r\n\"Tuesday, November 19th, 1793. Judge six of the enemy's ships to be of\r\nthe line, two frigates and two brigs...On the wind shifting at 4 in a\r\nsquall, tacked, as did the Latona, which brought her near the rear of the\r\nenemy's ships, at which she fired several shot; she tacked again at 5,\r\nand fired, which the sternmost of their ships returned. At dark the enemy\r\npassed to windward of us, about 5 or 6 miles...12, set top-gallant-sails,\r\nbut obliged to take them in again for fear of carrying away the masts.\r\nSundry attempts were made during the night to set, but as often obliged\r\nto take them in. At 12 lost sight of all our ships except one frigate.\r\nThe weather very hazy, with squalls at times, and at 2 a heavy shower of\r\nrain, which lasted a considerable time. When it cleared a little, saw two\r\nor three of the enemy's ships ahead of the others on the lee bow. Very\r\nthick and hazy, with much rain. Made the signal that the enemy had bore\r\naway. Saw the Latona and Phoenix, who seemed suspicious of each other,\r\nbut on discovering they were friends both bore away after one of the\r\nenemy's ships...About 9 the Phoenix and Latona being the only friends in\r\nsight, the latter made the signal for the enemy being superior to the\r\nships chasing. Soon after we made the signal to call the frigates in...In\r\nthe firing the preceding evening the Latona received a shot between wind\r\nand water in the breadroom, and another in the galley; but happily no one\r\nwas hurt and but little injury received.\"\r\n\r\nAn amusing example of an attempt to \"dodge,\" under false colours, is\r\nrelated on the following day. The trick did not succeed.\r\n\r\n\"Wednesday, November 27th, 1793, a.m. Hazy weather. Squadron in company.\r\nSaw a strange ship\r\nto the southward, who hoisted an Union Jack at the main topmast head and\r\na red flag at the fore. The Phoenix being ahead made the private signal,\r\nbut the stranger not answering she made the signal for an enemy. We\r\nimmediately made the general signal to chase. At 10 the Phoenix and\r\nLatona fired a few shots at her, upon which she hoisted French colours,\r\ndischarged her guns, and struck. She proved to be La Blonde of 28 guns\r\nand 190 men. The squadron brought to. The French captain came on board\r\nand surrendered his sword to the commodore. Separated the prisoners\r\namongst the squadron. An officer of the Phoenix sent to take charge of\r\nthe prize and a party of men from each ship.\r\n\r\n\"Tuesday, December 1st, 1793. Brought to. The Phoenix sent into Falmouth,\r\nMr. Waterhouse, Lieutenant, sent in her to take charge of the Blonde\r\nprize.\"\r\n\r\nThe French fleet, as related above, put out of Brest on May 16, 1794.\r\nFlinders tells us how they were sighted, and what happened during the\r\ndays preceding the great battle:\r\n\r\n\"Friday, May 23rd. The Southampton brought a strange brig into the fleet\r\nand destroyed her...a.m. A fine little ship, called the Albion, of\r\nBermuda, set on fire by the Glory. The Aquilon brought a strange ship\r\ninto the fleet. A galliot, with Dutch colours inverted, passed through\r\nthe fleet, having been set on fire by the Niger...A French man-of-war,\r\ncaptured and brought into the fleet by the frigates, was set on fire.\r\n\r\n\"Saturday, May 24. The ship brought into the fleet by the Aquilon left us\r\nand stood to the eastward. She was bound to Hull, and was part of a Dutch\r\nconvoy, most of which had been taken and destroyed by the French fleet on\r\nWednesday last.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, May 25th. At daybreak saw four sail to windward; our squadron\r\nsent in chase. Fired a shot and brought to a French brig, man-of-war.\r\nMade signal that the prize was not secure, and chased a large ship\r\nfurther to windward, apparently of the line, and with another ship in\r\ntow. Tacked as soon as she was on our beam. She had cast off her prize as\r\nsoon as we fired at the brig. In passing, fired at and brought to a\r\nFrench corvette; but left her for the fleet to pick up. Passed to leeward\r\nof the ship the chase had in tow. She appeared to be a large merchantman\r\nand had up American colours. The frigates in chase picked her up soon\r\nafter. At 10 the chase was nearly hull down, and gained upon us. Stood\r\nback to the fleet, being recalled by signal. Saw one of the prizes in\r\nflames, and found the three had been destroyed at noon; 162 leagues west\r\nby south of Ushant.\"\r\n\r\nIn the ensuing pages we are brought into the thick of the battle.\r\n\r\n\"Wednesday, May 28th. Saw two strange sail, one of which the Phoenix\r\nspoke, and soon after made signal for a strange fleet south-south-west.\r\nAbout 8, we counted 33 sail, 24 or 25 of which appeared to be of the\r\nline, and all standing down towards us. At 8.30 our signal was made to\r\nreconnoitre the enemy--as we were now certain they were. A frigate of\r\ntheir's was likewise looking at us. At noon the enemy's fleet south-west\r\nto west-south-west, on the larboard tack under an easy sail in line\r\nahead, and distant 3 or 4 leagues. Our fleet 3 or 4 leagues to leeward in\r\nthe order of sailing or under a press of sail. Ushant north 82 degrees\r\neast 143 leagues.\r\n\r\n\"Thursday, May 29th, 1794. Fresh gales with rain at times, and a swell\r\nfrom the westward. Repeated the general signals for chase, battle, etc.\r\nKd.* ship occasionally, working to windward under a press of sail, our\r\nsquadron and the frigates in company, and our fleet a few miles to\r\nleeward.\r\n\r\n(* \"Kd. ship\" is an expression which puzzled Professor Flinders Petrie,\r\nwho appended a note to the Flinders papers, suggesting that it could\r\nhardly mean kedged. Captain Bayldon supplies an exceedingly interesting\r\nexplanation:\r\n\r\n\"Without the least doubt 'Kd. ship' means 'tacked ship.' 'Kd.' is either\r\na private abbreviation of Flinders' for 'tacked' or else he intended to\r\nhave written 'Tkd.' There is no nautical term beginning with K which\r\nwould make the least sense under the circumstances. 'Kedged' is utterly\r\ninadmissable; both fleets were under way in pretty heavy weather.\r\n'Working to windward' practically means 'tacking ship.' So why did\r\nFlinders mention an obvious fact, 'tacked ship'? Because the weather was\r\nbad, strong breezes, heavy swell, and therefore it was very hazardous to\r\ntack ship (on account of throwing the sails aback) and also many ships\r\ncould not be forced into tacking with a heavy head swell. Consequently it\r\nis usual to wear ship under these conditions (turn her round before the\r\nwind). So he then mentions 'under a press of sail,' to force her up into\r\nthe wind (also making it a risky manoeuvre, for they could easily lose\r\ntheir masts--foremast especially). Hence he was proud of the manoeuvre,\r\nso mentions, 'tacked ship occasionally, under a press of sail.' On the\r\n29th May at 8 a.m., the French van wore in succession. (Fresh wind, heavy\r\nhead sea). Soon after noon (Flinders' old nautical time gives May 30th)\r\nLord Howe signalled the British fleet to tack in succession. The leading\r\nship, the Caesar, instead of obeying, made the signal of inability and\r\nwore round. The next ship, the Queen, also wore. So (at 1.30 p.m.) Lord\r\nHowe set the example in the Queen Charlotte and tacked. Pasley's\r\nBellerophon followed him, and tacked also; the Leviathan tacked and\r\nfollowed her. These three ships were the only ones to tack. All the\r\nremainder wore, and so did the French. Either their captains would not\r\ntake the risk, or else could not force their ships through the heavy head\r\nsea. So I expect Flinders and the 'Bully ruffians' felt elated at their\r\nperformance and he intended to record 'Tkd. ship.'\")\r\n\r\n\"About 3 the Russell, being a mile or two to windward of us, began to\r\nfire on the enemy's rear, as they were hauling on the larboard tack, and\r\ncontinued to stand on with the Thunderer and frigates, to get into their\r\nwake. We tacked a little before the rear ship was on our beam, which\r\nenabled us to bring them to action a considerable time before the other\r\nships could come up to our assistance. Our first fire was directed on a\r\nlarge frigate which brought up the enemy's rear, but she soon made sail\r\nand went to windward of the next ship (a three-decker)* (* The\r\nRevolutionnaire.) on whom we immediately pointed our guns. In a few\r\nminutes she returned it with great spirit, our distance from her being\r\nsomething more than a mile. My Lord Howe, seeing us engaged with a\r\nthree-decked ship, and the next ahead of him frequently giving us a few\r\nguns, made the Russell and Marlborouqh's signals to come to our\r\nassistance, they being on the weather quarter. About dusk more of the\r\nfleet had got up with us, the signal having been made to chase without\r\nregard to order. The Leviathan and Audacious, particularly, passed to\r\nwindward of us, and came to close engagement; the first keeping as close\r\nto him to leeward as she could fetch, and the latter fetching to windward\r\nof him, laid herself athwart his stern and gave a severe raking. The\r\nheadmost of the French fleet were apparently hove to, but made no effort\r\nto relieve their comrade. At this time our maincap was seen to be so\r\nbadly sprung as to oblige us to take in the main topsail; the larboard\r\ntopsail sheet block was likewise shot away. Got down the top-gallant yard\r\nand mast, and, the ship being scarcely under command, we made the signal\r\nfor inability. Soon after the Admiral called us by signal into his wake.\r\nThe enemy's rear ship about 9 had his mizzenmast gone and he bore down\r\ntowards us, the Russell and Thunderer striking close to his weather\r\nquarter and lee bow, keeping up a severe fire, but he scarcely returned a\r\nshot. Having got clear of them he continued coming down on us, apparently\r\nwith the intention of striking to our flag, but firing a shot now and\r\nthen. He was intercepted by one of our ships, who running to leeward of\r\nhim soon silenced his guns, and, we concluded, had obliged him to strike.\r\nThe enemy's fleet were now collected about 3 miles to windward, carrying\r\nlights, as did ours. We were in no regular order, it having been broken\r\nup by the chase. A.M., employed securing the maincap, etc. All hands kept\r\nat quarters. Fresh breezes and hazy weather. At daybreak the enemy's line\r\nwas formed about 2 miles distant, and our commander in chief made the\r\nsignal to form the line of battle, and take stations as most convenient.\r\nWe bore down and took ours astern of the Queen Charlotte, the Marlborough\r\nand Royal Sovereign following. About 8 our fleet tacked in succession,\r\nwith a view to cut off the enemy's rear, the Caesar leading and my Lord\r\nHowe the 10th ship. As soon as our van were sufficiently near to bring\r\nthem to action, the enemy's whole fleet wore in succession, and ran to\r\nleeward of their line in order to support their rear, and edged down van\r\nto van. At 10 the firing commenced between the headmost ships of both\r\nlines, but at too great a distance to do much execution, and the Admiral\r\nmade the signal to tack in succession in order to bring the enemy to\r\nclose action, but not being taken notice of, about noon it was repeated\r\nwith a gun. The Leviathan, being next ahead of the Admiral, fired some\r\nguns, but the Queen Charlotte and those astern did not attempt it. Hazy\r\nweather at noon with a considerable swell from the westward. Latitude\r\nobserved to be 47 degrees 35 minutes north. NOTE--We found this morning\r\nat daybreak that the Audacious was missing, and we concluded was the ship\r\nwho had secured the prize, neither being in sight.* (* Of course this\r\nsurmise was incorrect. The Audacious had not secured the Revolutionnaire\r\nwhich was towed into Rochefort by the Audacieux (curious similarity in\r\nnames). The Audacious badly crippled made her way to Plymouth\r\nalone.--[Captain Bayldon's note].)\r\n\r\n\"Friday, May 30th. Fresh breezes and hazy weather. The signal for the van\r\nto tack was again repeated, when the Caesar made the signal of inability;\r\nbut at last they got round, and the Admiral made signal to cut through\r\nthe enemy's line; but finding our leading ships were passing to leeward,\r\nwe tacked a considerable time before the ships came in succession, and\r\nluffed up as close to them as possible. The enemy were now well within\r\npoint-blank shot, which began to fall very thick about us, and several\r\nhad passed through our sails before we tacked. Immediately we came into\r\nthe Queen Charlotte's wake we tacked, lay up well for the enemy's rear,\r\nand began a severe fire, giving it to each ship as we passed. My Lord\r\nHowe in the Charlotte kept his luff, and cut through their line between\r\nthe 4th and 5th ship in the rear. We followed, and passed between the 2nd\r\nand 3rd. The rest of the fleet passed to leeward. Their third ship gave\r\nus a severe broadside on the bow as we approached to pass under her\r\nstern, and which we took care to return by two on her quarter and stern.\r\nBefore we had cleared her, her fore and maintop masts fell over the side,\r\nand she was silenced for a while, but it was only till we had passed her.\r\nTheir rear ship received several broadsides even from our three-deckers,\r\nbut kept her colours up. The Orion ran down to her, but getting upon her\r\nbeam and too far to leeward was obliged to leave her, and she got to her\r\nown fleet, whom we were now to windward of. Lord Howe made the signal to\r\ntack, and for a general chase, but few of the van ships were able to\r\nfollow him. For ourselves, we lay to, to reeve new braces and repair the\r\nrigging, which was entirely cut to pieces forward. The foresail was\r\nrendered useless, and was cut away, and being only able to set a\r\nclose-reefed main topsail for fear of the cap giving way, we were not\r\nable to follow his lordship. The French perceiving how few followed them,\r\nrallied, tacked, and supported their disabled ships, and even made a\r\nfeint to cut off the Queen, who was rendered a wreck. The Admiral, seeing\r\ntheir intention, bore down with several of the heavy ships who had not\r\nbeen engaged, and forced them to leeward of our disabled ships. At 5.30\r\nhaving got a new foresail bent, and the rigging in a little order, we\r\nbore down and joined the Admiral, who soon after formed the line in two\r\ndivisions, and stood to the westward under an easy sail abreast of the\r\nenemy, who were to leeward in a line ahead; the disabled ships in both\r\nfleets repairing their damages, several of theirs being without topmasts\r\nand topsail yards. At sunset saw two ships pass to windward, conjectured\r\nto be the Audacious and prize. Employed splicing and knotting the\r\nrigging, and repairing sails, not one of which but had several shot\r\nthrough them. The truck of the foretopgallant mast was likewise shot\r\naway. A.M., thick foggy weather. Saw the enemy at times north-north-west\r\n4 or 5 miles. At noon very foggy. Latitude 47 degrees 39 minutes north by\r\ndull observation.\r\n\r\n\"Saturday, May 31st, 1794. Lost sight of the enemy and only four of our\r\nown ships in sight. People employed repairing sail, rigging, etc., with\r\nall expedition. At noon thick and foggy. No enemy in sight; 30 sail of\r\nour own ships.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, June 1st, 1794.* (* Nautical reckoning in Flinders' day was 12\r\nhours ahead; i.e., his June 1 began at noon on May 31. Occurrences\r\nfollowing \"a.m.,\" happened on June 1 by the Almanac.) Moderate breezes\r\nand foggy weather. Before two it began to clear up. Saw the enemy to\r\nleeward, 8 or 9 miles distant, and made the signal for that purpose. Soon\r\nafter the whole fleet bore down towards them by signal. The enemy were\r\nedging away from the wind, and several of their ships were changing\r\nstations in the line; some of them without topmasts and topsail yards.\r\nAbout 7, the van of our fleet being within three miles of the enemy's\r\ncentre, the heavy ships in the rear a considerable way astern, the\r\nAdmiral made the signal to haul to the wind together on the larboard\r\ntack, judging we should not be able to bring on a general action\r\nto-night. At sunset the enemy were in a line ahead from north-west by\r\nwest to north-east by east about four miles distant, and apparently\r\nsteering about two points from the wind. At 11 the Phaeton passed along\r\nthe line, and informed the different ships that Lord Howe intended\r\ncarrying single reefed T.S.F. sail, jib and M.T.M.S. sail.* (* Letters\r\nprobably denote single reefed Top Sails, Fore sail, jib and Main Topmast\r\nand Main Stay sails.) After speaking us he kept on our lee bow; each ship\r\ncarrying a light by signal. A.M., fresh breezes and cloudy. At daybreak\r\nthe enemy not in sight, our rear ships a long way astern, their signal\r\nmade to make more sail; when the line became tolerably connected, the\r\nwhole fleet bore away and steered north-west by signal. A little before\r\nsix saw the enemy in the north by east about 3 leagues. Made the signal\r\nto the Admiral for that purpose, who by signal ordered the fleet to alter\r\nthe course to starboard together, bearing down towards them. About 8,\r\nbeing nearly within shot of the enemy's van, hove to for the rear of the\r\nfleet to come up. Lord Howe made the signal 34, which we understood was\r\nto pass through the enemy's line, but it did not seem to be understood by\r\nthe rest of the fleet. At 8.10 the signal was made to bear up and each\r\nengage his opponent. We accordingly ran down within musket shot of our\r\nopponent, and hove to, having received several broadsides from their van\r\nships in so doing. We now began a severe fire upon our opponent, the\r\nsecond ship in the enemy's van, which she returned with great briskness.\r\nThe van ship likewise fired many shot at us, his opponent the Caesar\r\nkeeping to windward, not more than two points before our beam in general,\r\nand of course nearly out of point-blank shot. About 8.30 Admiral Graves\r\nmade his and the Russell's signal to engage their opponent; we likewise\r\nmade Captain Molloy's (the Caesar) signal twice to bear down and come to\r\nclose action. About 9 the action became general throughout the two\r\nfleets, but the Tremendous kept out of the line, but on being ordered in\r\nby signal from the Admiral, she bore down after some time. A little\r\nbefore 11 our brave Admiral (Pasley) lost his leg by an 18-pound shot,\r\nwhich came through the barricading of the quarter-deck. It was now the\r\nheat of the action. The Caesar was not yet come close to his opponent,\r\nwho in consequence of that fired all his after guns at us. Our own ship\r\nkept up a severe fire, and by keeping well astern to let the Caesar take\r\nher station, their third van ship shot up on our quarter, and for some\r\ntime fired all his fore guns upon us. Our shot was directed on three\r\ndifferent ships as the guns could be got to bear. In ten or fifteen\r\nminutes we saw the foremast of the third ship go by the board, and the\r\nsecond ship's main-top-sail-yard down upon the cap. Otherwise the two\r\nheadmost had not received much apparent injury, at least in the rigging.\r\nAt 11 1/4, however, they both bore away and quitted the line, their\r\nAdmiral being obliged to do the same some time before by the Queen\r\nCharlotte. On seeing the two van ships hauling upon the other tack, we\r\nconjectured they meant to give us their starboard guns. The Caesar's\r\nsignal was immediately made by us to chase the flying ships. On his\r\nbearing down they were put into confusion, and their ship falling down\r\nupon them they received several broadsides from the Leviathan and us,\r\nbefore they could get clear; which when they effected they kept away a\r\nlittle, then hauled their wind in the starboard tack, and stood away from\r\nthe opposing fleets. And now, being in no condition to follow, we ceased\r\nfiring; the main and foretopmast being gone, every main shroud but one on\r\nthe larboard side cut through, and many on the other, besides having the\r\nmain and foremasts with all the rigging and sails in general much\r\ninjured. We made the Latona's signal to come to our assistance, and got\r\nentirely out of action. When the smoke cleared away, saw eleven ships\r\nwithout a mast standing, two of whom proved to be the Marlborough and\r\nDefence. The rest were enemy's, who, notwithstanding their situation kept\r\ntheir colours up, and fired at any of our ships that came near them. The\r\nLeviathan's opponent particularly (the same ship whose foremast we shot\r\naway) lying perfectly dismasted, the Leviathan ran down to him to take\r\npossession; but on her firing a gun to make him haul down his colours, he\r\nreturned a broadside, and a severe action again commenced between them\r\nfor nearly half an hour, and we could see shot falling on the water on\r\nthe opposite side of the Frenchman, which appeared to have gone through\r\nboth his sides, the ships being at half a cable's length from each other.\r\nThe Leviathan falling to leeward could not take the advantage of him her\r\nsails gave her, and, seeing his obstinacy, left him, but not before his\r\nfire was nearly silenced. About 11.30 the firing was pretty well ceased\r\non all sides, the Queen having only a foremast standing was fallen to\r\nleeward between the two fleets. She stood on the larboard tack to fetch\r\nour fleet, keeping to the wind in an astonishing manner, which we\r\nafterwards learnt was effected by getting up boat's sails abaft. In this\r\nsituation every ship she passed gave her a broadside or more, which she\r\nreturned with great spirit, keeping up an almost incessant blaze. After\r\nshe had stood on past the fleets, she wore round and stood back, pursuing\r\nthe same conduct as before, but the French, having collected their\r\nbest-conditioned ships in a body, and being joined by two or three other\r\ndisabled ships, were making off, having apparently given up all ideas of\r\nsaving the rest. On this our fleet stood down a little, and the Queen\r\njoined. We were now employed knotting, splicing, repairing, etc. the\r\nrigging, cutting away the wrecks of the fore and main topmasts, and\r\nsecuring the lower masts. Fortunately no accident happened with the\r\npowder, or with guns bursting. We had but three men killed outright (a\r\nfourth died of his wounds very soon after) and about 30 men wounded,\r\namongst whom five lost their limbs, and the other leg of one man was so\r\nmuch shattered as to be taken off some time after. Our brave Admiral was\r\nunfortunately in this list, as before observed. Captain Smith of the\r\nMarines and Mr. Chapman, boatswain, were amongst the wounded on the\r\nsecond day. Most of our spars were destroyed, and the boats severely\r\ninjured. About noon we had still fine weather and the enemy standing away\r\nfrom us, except one ship, which did not seem injured, and paraded to\r\nwindward, as if with the intention of giving some of us disabled ships a\r\nbrush. However, we were well prepared for him, having got tolerably clear\r\nof the wreck, and he stood back again and out of sight, having spoken one\r\nof their wrecks. Lord Howe made the signal to form the line as most\r\nconvenient, but it was a long time before that movement could be\r\neffected.\"\r\n\r\nFlinders wrote in his journal an estimate of the French sailors who were\r\nput on board his ship as prisoners. It is of some historical value:\r\n\r\n\"Their seamen, if we may judge from our own prisoners, are in a very bad\r\nstate both with respect to discipline and knowledge of their profession;\r\nboth which were evidently shown by the condition we saw them in on the\r\n31st, many of them being without topmasts and topsail yards, and nearly\r\nin as bad a state as on the 29th after the action. 'Tis true they were\r\nrather better when we saw them in the morning of June 1st. Out of our 198\r\nprisoners there certainly cannot be above 15 or 20 seamen, and all\r\ntogether were the dirtiest, laziest set of beings conceivable. How an\r\nidea of liberty, and more so that of fighting for it, should enter into\r\ntheir heads, I know not; but by their own confession it is not their wish\r\nand pleasure, but that of those who sent them; and so little is it their\r\nown that in the Brunswick (who was engaged yardarm and yardarm with the\r\nVengeur) they could see the French officers cutting down the men for\r\ndeserting their quarters. Indeed, in the instances of the Russell and\r\nThunderer when close to the Revolutionnaire, and ours when cutting the\r\nline, the French do not like to come too close. A mile off they will\r\nfight desperately.\"\r\n\r\nPasley's loss of a leg had a decisive effect upon the career of Matthew\r\nFlinders. So fine a sailor and so tough a fighting man would\r\nunquestionably, if not partially incapacitated, have had conferred upon\r\nhim during the following years of war commands that would have led to his\r\nplaying a very prominent part in fleet operations. As it was, he did not\r\ngo to sea again, though he was promoted through various ranks to that of\r\nAdmiral of the Blue (1801). He became commander in chief at the Nore in\r\n1798, and at Plymouth in 1799. Had he received other sea commands, his\r\nvigorous, alert young aide-de-camp might have continued to serve with\r\nhim, and would thus have just missed the opportunities that came to him\r\nin his next sphere of employment. What young officer would not have\r\neagerly followed a gallant and warm-hearted Admiral who had first placed\r\nhim upon a British quarterdeck and had made him an aide-de-camp? As it\r\nwas, the chance that came to Flinders about two months after the battle\r\noff Brest was one that ministered to his decided preference for service\r\nin seas where there was exploratory work to do.\r\n\r\nPasley's influence upon the life of Flinders was so important, that a\r\ncharacterisation of him by one who has perused his letters and journals\r\nmust be quoted.* (* Memoir of Admiral Sir T.S. Pasley, by Louisa M.\r\nSabine Pasley. Sir T.S. Pasley was the grandson of Flinders' Admiral. It\r\nunfortunately happens that the Journals of \"old Sir Thomas\" which are\r\nextant do not cover the period when Flinders acted as his aide-de-camp.\r\nMiss Sabine Pasley was kind enough to have a search made among his papers\r\nfor any trace of Flinders' relations with him, but without success.) \"It\r\nis impossible,\" writes Miss L.M. Sabine Pasley, \"not to be impressed from\r\nthese journals with a strong feeling of respect for the writer, so\r\nsimple-minded, so kind-hearted, such a brave old sailor of his\r\ntime--rough, no doubt, in manners and language, but with an earnest and\r\ngenuine piety that shows itself from time to time in little ejaculations\r\nand prayers, contrasting, it must be owned, rather strongly with the\r\nterms in which the 'rascally Yankies' are alluded to in the same pages.\"\r\nWhat Howe thought of him is recorded in a letter which he sent to the\r\nRear-Admiral a fortnight after the battle, regretting that \"the services\r\nof a friend he so highly esteemed and so gallant an officer, capable of\r\nsuch spirited exertions, should be restrained by any disaster from the\r\ncontinued exertion of them.\" There is also on record a letter to Pasley\r\nfrom the Prime Minister, a model of grace and delicate feeling, in which\r\nPitt signified that the King had conferred on him a baronetcy \"as a mark\r\nof the sense which His Majesty entertains of the distinguished share\r\nwhich you bore in the late successful and glorious operations of His\r\nMajesty's fleet,\" and assured him \"of the sincere satisfaction which I\r\npersonally feel in executing this commission.\"\r\n\r\nOn the south-western coast of Australia, eight years later, Flinders\r\nremembered his first commander when naming the natural features of the\r\ncountry. Cape Pasley, at the western tip of the arc of the great\r\nAustralian Bight, celebrates \"the late Admiral Sir Thomas Pasley, under\r\nwhom I had the honour of entering the naval service.\"* (* Flinders,\r\nVoyage to Terra Australis 1 87.) On some current maps of Australia the\r\ncape is spelt \"Paisley,\" an error which obscures the interesting\r\nbiographical fact with which the name is connected.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that though the career of Flinders as a naval officer\r\ncovers the stormiest period in British naval history, the whole of his\r\npersonal experience of battle was confined to these five days, May 28 to\r\nJune 1, 1794. The whole significance of his life lies in the work of\r\ndiscovery that he accomplished, and in the contributions he made to\r\ngeography and navigation. Yet he was destined to feel the effect of the\r\nenmity of the French in a peculiarly distressing form. His useful life\r\nwas cut short largely by misfortunes that came upon him as a consequence\r\nof war, and work which he would have done to the enhancement of his\r\nreputation and the advancement of civilisation was thwarted by it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHY BEFORE FLINDERS.\r\n\r\nIn order that the importance of the work done by Flinders may be\r\nadequately appreciated, it is necessary to understand the state of\r\ninformation concerning Australian geography before the time of his\r\ndiscoveries. Not only did he complete the main outlines of the map of the\r\ncontinent, but he filled in many details in parts that had been traversed\r\nby his predecessors. This is a convenient point whereat to interrupt the\r\nnarrative of his life with a brief sketch of what those predecessors had\r\ndone, and of the curiously haphazard mode in which a partial knowledge of\r\nthis fifth division of the globe had been pieced together.\r\n\r\nThere never was, until Flinders applied himself to the task, any\r\ndeliberately-planned, systematic, persistent exploration of any portion\r\nof the Australian coast. The continent grew on the map of the world\r\ngradually, slowly, almost accidentally. It emerged out of the unknown,\r\nlike some vast mythical monster heaving its large shoulders dank and\r\ndripping from the unfathomed sea, and metamorphosed by a kiss from the\r\nlips of knowledge into a being fair to look upon and rich in kindly\r\nfavours. It took two centuries and a half for civilised mankind to know\r\nAustralia, even in form, from the time when it was clearly understood\r\nthat there was such a country, until at length it was mapped, measured\r\nand circumnavigated. Before this process began, there was a dialectical\r\nstage, when it was hotly contested whether there could possibly be upon\r\nthe globe lands antipodean to Europe; and both earlier and later there\r\nwere conjectural stages when makers of maps, having no certain data, but\r\nfeeling sure that the blank southern hemisphere ought to be filled up\r\nsomehow, exercised a vagrant fancy and satisfied a long-felt want by\r\ndecorating their drawings with representations of a Terra Incognita\r\nhaving not even a casual resemblance to the reality.\r\n\r\nThe process presents few points of resemblance to that by which the\r\ndiscovery of America was accomplished. Almost as soon as Europe came into\r\ntouch with the western hemisphere, discovery was pursued with unflagging\r\nenergy, until its whole extent and contour were substantially known.\r\nWithin fifty years after Columbus led the way across the Atlantic (1492),\r\nNorth and South America were laid down with something approaching\r\nprecision; and Gerard Mercator's map of 1541 presented the greater part\r\nof the continent with the name fairly inscribed upon it. There were, it\r\nis true, some errors and some gaps, especially on the west coast, which\r\nleft work for navigators to do. But the essential point is that in less\r\nthan half a century Europe had practically comprehended America as an\r\naddition to the known world. There was but a brief twilight interval\r\nbetween nescience and knowledge. How different was the case with\r\nAustralia! Three hundred years after the date of Columbus' first voyage,\r\nthe mere outline of this continent had not been wholly mapped.\r\n\r\nDuring the middle ages, when ingenious men exercised infinite subtlety in\r\nspeculation, and wrote large Latin folios to prove each other wrong in\r\nmatters about which neither party knew anything at all, there was much\r\ndissertation about the possibility of antipodes. Bishops and saints waxed\r\neloquent upon the theme. The difficulty of conceiving of lands where\r\npeople walked about with their heads hanging downwards, and their feet\r\nexactly opposite to those of Europeans, was too much for some of the\r\nscribes who debated \"about it and about.\" The Greek, Cosmas\r\nIndicopleustes, denounced the \"old wives' fable of Antipodes,\" and asked\r\nhow rain could be said to \"fall,\" as in the Scriptures, in regions where\r\nit would have to \"come up\"* (* The Christian Topography of Cosmas,\r\ntranslated by J.W. McCrindle, page 17 (Hakluyt Society).) Some would have\r\nit that a belief in Antipodes was heretical. But Isidore of Seville, in\r\nhis Liber de Natura Rerum, Basil of Caesarea, Ambrose of Milan, and\r\nVergil Bishop of Salzburg, an Irish saint, declined to regard the\r\nquestion as a closed one. \"Nam partes eius (i.e. of the earth) quatuor\r\nsunt,\" argued Isidore. Curiously enough, the copy of the works of the\r\nSaint of Seville used by the author (published at Rome in 1803), was\r\nsalvaged from a wreck which occurred on the Australian coast many years\r\nago. It is stained with seawater, and emits the musty smell which tells\r\nof immersion. An inscription inside the cover relates the circumstance of\r\nthe wreck. Who possessed the book one does not know; some travelling\r\nscholar may have perused it during the long voyage from Europe; and one\r\nfancies him, as the ship bumped upon the rocks, exclaiming \"Yes, Isidore\r\nwas right, there ARE antipodes!\"\r\n\r\nFrom about the fourth quarter of the sixteenth century until the date of\r\nAbel Tasman's voyages, 1642 to 1644, there was a period of vague\r\nspeculation about a supposed great southern continent. The maps of the\r\ntime indicate the total lack of accurate information at the disposal of\r\ntheir compilers. There was no general agreement as to what this region\r\nwas like in its outlines, proportions, or situation. Some cartographers,\r\nas Peter Plancius (1594) and Hondius (1595), trailed a wavy line across\r\nthe foot of their representations of the globe, inscribed Terra Australis\r\nupon it, and by a fine stroke of invention gave an admirable aspect of\r\nfinish and symmetry to the form of the world. The London map of 1578,\r\nissued with George Best's Discourse of the Late Voyages of Discoverie,\r\nbarricaded the south pole with a Terra Australis not unlike the design of\r\na switch-back railway. Molyneux' remarkable map, circa 1590, dropped the\r\nvast imaginary continent, and displayed a small tongue of land in about\r\nthe region where the real Australia is; suggesting that some voyager had\r\nbeen blown out of his course, had come upon a part of the western\r\ndivision of the continent, and had jotted down a memorandum of its\r\nappearance upon his chart. It looks like a sincere attempt to tell a bit\r\nof the truth. But speaking generally, the Terra Australis of the old\r\ncartographers was a gigantic antipodean imposture, a mere piece of\r\nmap-makers' furniture, put in to fill up the gaping space at the south\r\nend of the globe.\r\n\r\nA few minutes devoted to the study of a map of the Indian Ocean,\r\nincluding the Cape of Good Hope and the west coast of\r\nAustralia--especially one indicating the course of currents--will show\r\nhow natural it was that Portuguese and Dutch ships engaged in the spice\r\ntrade should occasionally have found themselves in proximity to the real\r\nTerra Australis. It will also explain more clearly than a page of type\r\ncould do, why the western and north-western coasts were known so early,\r\nwhilst the eastern and southern shores remained undelineated until James\r\nCook and Matthew Flinders sailed along them.\r\n\r\nA change of the route pursued by the Dutch on their voyages to the East\r\nIndies had already conduced to an acquaintance with the Australian coast.\r\nOriginally, after rounding the Cape, their ships had sailed north-east to\r\nMadagascar, and had thence struck across the Indian Ocean to Java, or to\r\nCeylon. As long as this course was followed, there was little prospect of\r\nsighting the great continent which lay about three thousand miles east of\r\ntheir habitual track. But this route, though from the map it appeared to\r\nbe the most direct, was the longest in duration that they could take. It\r\nbrought them into the region of light winds and tedious tropical calms;\r\nso that very often a vessel would lie for weeks \"as idle as a painted\r\nship upon a painted ocean,\" and would occupy over a year upon the outward\r\nvoyage. In 1611, however, one of their commanders discovered that if,\r\nafter leaving the Cape, a ship ran not north-east, but due east for about\r\nthree thousand miles, she would be assisted by the winds, not baffled by\r\ncalms. Henrick Brouwer, who made the experiment, arrived in Java seven\r\nmonths after leaving Holland, whereas some ships had been known to be as\r\nlong as eighteen months at sea. The directors of the Dutch East India\r\nCompany, recognising the importance of the discovery, ordered their\r\ncommanders to follow the easterly route from the Cape in future, and\r\noffered prizes to those who completed the voyage in less than nine\r\nmonths. The result was that the Dutch skippers became exceedingly anxious\r\nto make the very utmost of the favourable winds, which carried them\r\neastward in the direction of the western coasts of Australia.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that in 1616 the Eendragt stumbled on Australia opposite\r\nShark's Bay. Her captain, Dirk Hartog, landed on the long island which\r\nlies as a natural breakwater between the bay and the ocean, and erected a\r\nmetal plate to record his visit; and Dirk Hartog Island is the name it\r\nbears to this day. The plate remained till 1697, when another Dutchman,\r\nVlaming, substituted a new one for it; and Vlaming's plate, in turn,\r\nremained till 1817, when the French navigator, Freycinet, took it and\r\nsent it to Paris.\r\n\r\nAfter Hartog reported his discovery, the Dutch directors ordered their\r\nships' captains to run east from the Cape till they sighted the land.\r\nThis would enable them to verify their whereabouts; for in those days the\r\nmeans of reckoning positions at sea were so imperfect that navigators\r\ngroped about the oceans of the globe almost as if they were sailing in\r\ndarkness. But here was a means of verifying a ship's position after her\r\nlong run across from the Cape, and if she found Dirk Hartog Island, she\r\ncould safely thence make her way north to Java.\r\n\r\nBut ships did not always sight the Australian coast at the same point.\r\nHence it came about that in 1619 J. de Edel \"accidentally fell in with\"\r\nthe coast at the back of the Abrolhos. Pieter Nuyts, in 1627,\r\n\"accidentally discovered\" a long reach of the south coast. Similarly, in\r\n1628, the Vianen was \"accidentally,\" as the narrative says, driven on to\r\nthe north-west coast, and her commander, De Wit, gave his name to about\r\n200 miles of it. In 1629 the Dutch ship Batavia was separated in a storm\r\nfrom a merchant fleet of eleven sail, and ran upon the Abrolhos Reef. The\r\ncaptain, Francis Pelsart, who was lying sick in his cabin at the time of\r\nthe misadventure, \"called up the master and charged him with the loss of\r\nthe ship, who excused himself by saying he had taken all the care he\r\ncould; and that having discerned the froth at a distance he asked the\r\nsteersman what he thought of it, who told him that the sea appeared white\r\nby its reflecting the rays of the moon. The captain then asked him what\r\nwas to be done, and in what part of the world he thought they were. The\r\nmaster replied that God only knew that; and that the ship was on a bank\r\nhitherto undiscovered.\" The story of Pelsart's adventure was recorded,\r\nand the part of the coast which he saw was embodied on a globe published\r\nin 1700.\r\n\r\nTo the accidental discoveries must be added those made by the Dutch\r\nprompted by curiosity as to the possibility of drawing profit from the\r\nlands to the south of their great East India possessions. Thus the Dutch\r\nyacht Duyfhen, sent in 1605 to examine the Papuan islands, sailed along\r\nthe southern side of Torres Strait, found Cape York, and believed it to\r\nbe part of New Guinea. The great discovery voyages of Tasman, 1643 and\r\n1644, were planned in pursuit of the same policy. He was directed to find\r\nout what the southern portion of the world was like, \"whether it be land\r\nor sea, or icebergs, whatever God has ordained to be there.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1606 the Spaniard, Torres, also probably saw Cape York, and sailed\r\nthrough the strait which bears his name. He had accompanied Quiros across\r\nthe Pacific, but had separated from his commander at the New Hebrides,\r\nand continued his voyage westward, whilst Quiros sailed to South America.\r\n\r\nIt is needless for present purposes to catalogue the various voyages made\r\nby the Dutch, or to examine claims which have been preferred on account\r\nof other discoveries. It may, however, be observed that there are three\r\nwell defined periods of Australian maritime discovery, and that they\r\nrelate to three separate zones of operation.\r\n\r\nFirst, there was the period with which the Dutch were chiefly concerned.\r\nThe west and north-west coasts received the greater part of their\r\nattention, though the voyage of Tasman to the island now bearing his name\r\nwas a variation from their habitual sphere. The visits of the Englishman,\r\nDampier, to Western Australia are comprehended within this period.\r\n\r\nThe second period belongs to the eighteenth century, and its hero was\r\nJames Cook. He sailed up the whole of the east coast in 1770, from Point\r\nHicks, near the Victorian border, to Cape York at the northern tip of the\r\ncontinent, and accomplished a larger harvest of discovery than has ever\r\nfallen to the fortune of any other navigator in a single voyage. To this\r\nperiod also belongs Captain George Vancouver, who in 1791, on his way to\r\nnorth-western America from the Cape of Good Hope, came upon the\r\nsouth-western corner of Australia and discovered King George's Sound. In\r\nthe following year the French Admiral, Dentrecasteaux, despatched in\r\nsearch of the missing expedition of Laperouse, also made the south-west\r\ncorner of the continent, and followed the coast of the Great Australian\r\nBight for some hundreds of miles. His researches in southern Tasmania\r\nwere likewise of much importance.\r\n\r\nThe third period is principally that of Flinders, commencing shortly\r\nbefore the dawn of the nineteenth century, and practically completing the\r\nmaritime exploration of the continent.\r\n\r\nA map contained in John Pinkerton's Modern Geography shows at a glance\r\nthe state of knowledge\r\nabout Australia at the date of publication, 1802. Flinders had by that\r\ntime completed his explorations, but his work was not yet published. The\r\nmap delineates the contour of the continent on the east, west, and north\r\nsides, with as much accuracy as was possible, and, though it is defective\r\nin details, presents generally a fair idea of the country's shape. But\r\nthe line along the south coast represents a total lack of information as\r\nto the outline of the land. Pinkerton, indeed, though he was a leading\r\nEnglish authority on geography when his book was published, had not\r\nembodied in his map some results that were then available.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of the map may be augmented by a reference to what\r\ngeographical writers understood about Australia before the time of\r\nFlinders.\r\n\r\nThough Cook had discovered the east coast, and named it New South Wales,\r\nit was not definitely known whether this extensive stretch of country was\r\nseparate from the western \"New Holland\" which the Dutch had named, or\r\nwhether the two were the extremities of one vast tract of land.\r\nGeographical opinion rather inclined to the view that ultimately a strait\r\nwould be found dividing the region into islands. This idea is mentioned\r\nby Pinkerton. Under the heading \"New Holland\" he wrote:* \"Some suppose\r\nthat this extensive region, when more thoroughly investigated, will be\r\nfound to consist of two or three vast islands intersected by narrow seas,\r\nan idea which probably arises from the discovery that New Zealand\r\nconsists of two islands, and that other straits have been found to divide\r\nlands in this quarter formerly supposed to be continuous.\" The discovery\r\nthat Bass Strait divided Australia from Tasmania was probably in\r\nPinkerton's mind; he mentions it in his text (quoting Flinders), though\r\nhis map does not indicate the Strait's existence. He also mentions \"a\r\nvast bay with an isle,\" possibly Kangaroo Island. (* Modern Geography 2\r\n588.)\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was not unnatural that competent opinion should have favoured\r\nthe idea that there were several large islands, rather than one immense\r\ncontinent stretching into thirty degrees of latitude and forty-five of\r\nlongitude. The human mind is not generally disposed to grasp very big\r\nthings all at once. Indeed, in the light of fuller knowledge, one is\r\ndisposed to admire the caution of these geographers, whose beliefs were\r\ncarefully reasoned but erroneous, in face of, for instance, such a wild\r\nebullition of venturesome theory as that attributed to an aforetime\r\nGottingen professor,* (*Professor Blumenbach according to Lang,\r\nHistorical Account of New South Wales, 1837 2 142.) who considered that\r\nnot only was Australia one country, but that it made its appearance upon\r\nthis planet in a peculiarly sudden fashion. His opinion was that \"the\r\nvast continent of Australia was originally a comet, which happening to\r\nfall within the limits of the earth's attraction, alighted at length upon\r\nits surface.\" \"Alighted at length\" is a mild term, suggestive of a\r\nnervous lady emerging from a tram-car in a crowded street. \"Splashed,\"\r\nwould probably convey a more vigorous impression.\r\n\r\nThe belief that a strait would be found completely dividing New Holland\r\nwas a general one, as is shown by several contemporary writings. Thus\r\nJames Grant in his Narrative of a Voyage of Discovery (1803), expressing\r\nhis regret that his orders did not permit him to take his ship, the Lady\r\nNelson, northward from Port Jackson in 1801, speculated that \"we might\r\nalso betimes have ascertained if the Gulf of Carpentaria had any inlet to\r\nBass Straits, and if it be discovered secure more quickly to Great\r\nBritain the right of lands which some of our enterprising neighbours\r\nmight probably dispute with us. And this I trust will not be thought\r\nchimerical when it was not known whether other Straits did not exist as\r\nwell as that dividing New Holland from Van Diemen's Land.\" Again, the\r\nInstitute of France in preparing instructions for the voyage of\r\nexploration commanded by Nicolas Baudin (1800) directed a search to be\r\nmade for a strait which it was supposed divided Australia \"into two great\r\nand nearly equal islands.\"\r\n\r\nAnother interesting geographical problem to be determined, was whether a\r\ngreat river system drained any part of the Australian continent. In the\r\nexisting state of knowledge the country presented an aspect in regard to\r\nfluvial features wholly different from any other portion of the world. No\r\nriver of considerable importance had been found. Students of geography\r\ncould hardly conceive that there should be so large an area of land\r\nlacking outlets to the sea; and as none had been found in the parts\r\ninvestigated so far, it was believed that the exploration of the south\r\ncoast would reveal large streams flowing from the interior. Some had\r\nspeculated that within the country there was a great inland sea, and if\r\nso there would probably be rivers flowing from it to the ocean.\r\n\r\nA third main subject for elucidation when Flinders entered upon this\r\nwork, was whether the country known as Van Diemen's Land was part of the\r\ncontinent, or was divided from it by a strait not yet discovered. Captain\r\nCook entertained the opinion that a strait existed. On his voyage in the\r\nEndeavour in 1770, he was \"doubtful whether they are one land or no.\" But\r\nwhen near the north-eastern corner of Van Diemen's Land, he had been\r\ntwenty months at sea, and his supplies had become depleted. He did not\r\ndeem it advisable to sail west and settle the question forthwith, but,\r\nrunning up the eastern coast of New Holland, achieved discoveries\r\ncertainly great enough for one voyage. He retained the point in his mind,\r\nhowever, and would have determined it on his second voyage in 1772 to\r\n1774 had he not paid heed to information given by Tobias Furneaux. The\r\nAdventure, commanded by Furneaux, had been separated from the Resolution\r\non the voyage to New Zealand, and had cruised for some days in the\r\nneighbourhood of the eastern entrance to Bass Strait. But Furneaux\r\nconvinced himself that no strait existed, and reported to that effect\r\nwhen he rejoined Cook in Queen Charlotte's Sound. Cook was not quite\r\nconvinced by the statement of his officer; but contrary winds made a\r\nreturn to the latitude of the supposed strait difficult, and Cook though\r\n\"half inclined to go over to Van Diemen's Land and settle the question of\r\nits being part of New Holland\" decided to proceed westward. As will be\r\nseen hereafter, Flinders helped to show that the passage existed.\r\n\r\nThere were also many smaller points requiring investigation. Cook in\r\nrunning along the east coast had passed several portions in the night, or\r\nat such a distance in the daytime as to render his representation of the\r\ncoastline doubtful. Some groups of islands also required to be accurately\r\ncharted. Indeed, it may be said that there was no portion of the world\r\nwhere, at this period, there was so much and such valuable work to be\r\ndone by a competent and keen marine explorer, as in Australia.\r\n\r\nA passage in a manuscript by Flinders may be quoted to supplement what\r\nhas been written above, as it indicates the kind of speculations that\r\nwere current in the conversation of students of geography.* (* Called an\r\nAbridged Narrative--Flinders' Papers.)\r\n\r\n\"The interior of this new region, in extent nearly equal to all Europe,\r\nstrongly excited the curiosity of geographers and naturalists; and the\r\nmore so as, ten years after the establishment of a British Colony at Port\r\nJackson on the east coast, and the repeated effort of some enterprising\r\nindividuals, no part of it beyond 30 leagues from the coast had been seen\r\nby an European. Various conjectures were entertained upon the probable\r\nconsistence of this extensive space. Was it a vast desert? Was it\r\noccupied by an immense lake--a second Caspian Sea, or by a Mediterranean\r\nto which existed a navigable entrance in some part of the coasts hitherto\r\nunexplored? or was not this new continent rather divided into two or more\r\nislands by straits communicating from the unknown parts of the south to\r\nthe imperfectly examined north-west coast or to the Gulf of Carpentaria,\r\nor to both? Such were the questions that excited the interest and divided\r\nthe opinion of geographers.\"\r\n\r\nApart from particular directions in which enquiry needed to be pursued,\r\nit was felt in England that the only nation which had founded a\r\nsettlement on the Australian continent was under an obligation to\r\ncomplete the exploration of the country. The French had already sent out\r\ntwo scientific expeditions with instructions to examine the unknown\r\nsouthern coasts; and if shipwreck had not destroyed the first, and want\r\nof fresh water diverted the second, the credit of finishing the outline\r\nof the map of Australia would have been earned for France. \"Many\r\ncircumstances, indeed,\" wrote Flinders, \"united to render the south coast\r\nof Terra Australis one of the most interesting parts of the globe to\r\nwhich discovery could be directed at the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Its investigation had formed a part of the instructions to the\r\nunfortunate French navigator, Laperouse, and afterwards of those to his\r\ncountryman Dentrecasteaux; and it was not without some reason attributed\r\nto England as a reproach that an imaginary line of more than two hundred\r\nand fifty leagues' extent in the vicinity of one of her colonies should\r\nhave been so long suffered to remain traced upon the charts under the\r\ntitle of Unknown Coast. This comported ill with her reputation as the\r\nfirst of maritime powers.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall see how predominant was the share of Flinders in the settlement\r\nof these problems, the filling up of these gaps.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. THE RELIANCE AND THE TOM THUMB.\r\n\r\nApart from Admiral Pasley, two officers who participated in Lord Howe's\r\nvictory on \"the glorious First of June,\" had an important influence upon\r\nthe later career of Flinders. The first of these, Captain John Hunter,\r\nhad served on the flagship Queen Charlotte. The second, Henry Waterhouse,\r\nhad been fifth lieutenant on the Bellerophon. Flinders was under the\r\norders of both of them on his next voyage.\r\n\r\nHunter had accompanied the first Governor of New South Wales on the\r\nSirius, when a British colony was founded there in 1788, and was\r\ncommissioned by the Crown to assume the duties of Lieutenant-Governor in\r\ncase of Phillip's death. When the office fell vacant in 1793, Hunter\r\napplied for appointment. He secured the cordial support of Howe, and Sir\r\nRoger Curtis of the Queen Charlotte exerted his influence by recommending\r\nhim as one whose selection \"would be a blessing to the colony\" on account\r\nof his incorruptible integrity, unceasing zeal, thorough knowledge of the\r\ncountry, and steady judgment. He was appointed Governor in February,\r\n1794, and in March of the same year H.M.S. Reliance, with the tender\r\nSupply, were commissioned to convey him to Sydney.\r\n\r\nHenry Waterhouse was chosen to command the Reliance, under Hunter, at\r\nthat officer's request. He expressed to the Secretary of State a wish\r\nthat the appointment might be conferred upon an officer to whom it might\r\nbe a step in advancement, rather than upon one who had already attained\r\nthe rank of commander; and he recommended Waterhouse as one who, though a\r\nyoung man and not an old officer, was \"the only remaining lieutenant of\r\nthe Sirius, formerly under my command; and having had the principal part\r\nof his nautical education from me, I can with confidence say that he is\r\nwell qualified for the charge.\"\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Flinders heard of the expedition from his Bellerophon\r\nshipmate, Waterhouse, who by the end of July was under orders to sail as\r\nsecond captain of the Reliance. Certainly the opportunity of making\r\nanother voyage to Australian waters, wherein, as he knew, so much work\r\nlay awaiting an officer keen for discovery, coincided with his own\r\ninclinations. He wrote that he was led by his passion for exploring new\r\ncountries to embrace the opportunity of going out upon a station which of\r\nall others presented the most ample field for his favourite pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe sailing was delayed for six months, and in the interval young\r\nFlinders was able to visit his home in Lincolnshire. Whatever opposition\r\nthere may have been to his choice of the sea as a profession before 1790,\r\nwe may be certain that the Donington surgeon was not a little proud of\r\nhis eldest son when he returned after a wonderful voyage to the isles of\r\nthe Pacific and the Caribbean Sea, and after participation in the recent\r\ngreat naval fight which had thrilled the heart of England with exultation\r\nand pride. The boy who had left his father's house four years before as\r\nan anxious aspirant for the King's uniform now returned a bronzed seaman\r\non the verge of manhood. His intelligence and zeal as a junior officer\r\nhad won him the esteem and confidence of distinguished commanders. He had\r\nlooked upon the strangeness and beauty of the world in its most remote\r\nand least-known quarters, had witnessed fights with savages, threaded\r\nunmapped straits, and had, to crown his youthful achievements, striven\r\namidst the wrack and thunder of grim-visaged war. We may picture his\r\nwelcome: the strong grasp of his father's hand, the crowding enthusiasm\r\nof his brother and sisters fondly glorying in their hero's prowess. The\r\nwarnings of uncle John were all forgotten now. When the midshipman's\r\nyounger brother, Samuel Ward Flinders, desired to go to sea with him, he\r\nwas not restrained, and, in fact, accompanied him as a volunteer on the\r\nReliance when at length she sailed.\r\n\r\nHunter took not merely an official but a deep and discerning interest in\r\nthe colonisation of Australia. He foresaw its immense possibilities,\r\nencouraged its exploration, promoted the breeding of stock and the\r\ncultivation of crops, and had a wise concern for such strategic\r\nadvantages as would tend to secure it for British occupation. He\r\nperceived the great importance of the Cape of Good Hope from the point of\r\nview of Australian security; and a letter which he wrote to an official\r\nof the Admiralty while awaiting sailing orders for the Reliance (January\r\n25, 1795), is perhaps the first instance of official recognition of\r\nAustralia's vital interest in the ownership of that post. There was cause\r\nfor concern. The raw and ill-disciplined levies of the French, having at\r\nthe outbreak of the Revolutionary wars most unexpectedly turned back the\r\ninvading armies of Austria and Prussia, and having, after campaigns full\r\nof dramatic changes, shaken off the peril of the crushing of the\r\nfatherland by a huge European combination, were now waging an offensive\r\nwar in Holland. Pichegru, the French commander, though not a soldier by\r\ntraining, secured astonishing successes, and, in the thick of a winter of\r\nexceptional severity, led his ragged and ill-fed army on to victory after\r\nvictory, until the greater part of Holland lay conquered within his grip.\r\nIn January he entered Amsterdam. There was a strong element of Republican\r\nfeeling among the Dutch, and an alliance with France was demanded.\r\n\r\nWhen this condition of things was reported in England, Hunter was alarmed\r\nfor the safety of the colony which he was about to govern. The Cape of\r\nGood Hope was a Dutch possession. Holland was now under the domination of\r\nFrance. Might not events bring about the establishment of French power at\r\nthe Cape? \"I cannot help feeling much concerned at the rapid progress of\r\nthe French in Holland,\" he wrote, \"and I own shall not be surprised if in\r\nconsequence of their success in that country they make a sudden dash at\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, if we do not anticipate them in such an attempt.\r\nThey are so very active a people that it will be done before we know\r\nanything of it, and I think it a post of too much importance to be\r\nneglected by them. I hope earnestly, therefore, that it will be prevented\r\nby our sending a squadron and some troops as early as possible. If the\r\nRepublicans once get a footing there, we shall probably find it difficult\r\nto dislodge them. Such a circumstance would be a sad stroke for our young\r\ncolony.\"\r\n\r\nThe course which Hunter then advised was that which the British\r\nGovernment followed, though more because the Cape was the \"half way\r\nhouse\" to India, than for the protection of Australian interests. An\r\nexpedition was despatched later in the year to protect the Cape against\r\nFrench occupation, and in September the colony, by order of the\r\nStadtholder of Holland, accepted British protection.\r\n\r\nThe Reliance and the Supply left Plymouth on February 15th, 1795, amongst\r\na very large company of merchantmen and ships of the navy convoyed by the\r\nChannel Fleet under Lord Howe, which guarded them till they were beyond\r\nthe range of possible French attacks and then sailed back to port.\r\n\r\nFrom Teneriffe, which Hunter reached on March 6th, he wrote a despatch to\r\nthe Government stating his intention to sail, not to the Cape of Good\r\nHope, but to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, and thence to New South Wales. His\r\navoidance of the more direct route was due to the causes explained above.\r\n\"In the present uncertain state of things between the French and Dutch,\"\r\nhe had written before sailing, \"it will be dangerous for me to attempt\r\ntouching at the Cape on my way out;\" and writing from Rio de Janeiro in\r\nMay he explained that he did not \"conceive it safe from the uncertain\r\nstate of the Dutch settlements in India to take the Cape of Good Hope in\r\nmy way to Port Jackson, lest the French, following up their late\r\nsuccesses in Holland, should have been active enough to make an early\r\nattack on that very important post.\" In a despatch to the Duke of\r\nPortland he commented strongly on the same circumstance, expressing the\r\nopinion that \"if the French should be able to possess themselves of that\r\nsettlement it will be rather unfortunate for our distant colony.\"\r\n\r\nHunter had to complain of discourteous treatment received from the\r\nPortuguese Viceroy, who kept him waiting six days before according an\r\ninterview, and then fixed an appointment for seven o'clock in the\r\nevening, when it was quite dark. \"As His Excellency was acquainted with\r\nthe position I held, I confess I expected a different reception,\" wrote\r\nHunter; and he was so much vexed that he did not again set foot ashore\r\nwhile his ships lay in port. The incident, though not important in\r\nitself, serves, in conjunction with Hunter's avoidance of the Cape, to\r\nillustrate the rather limp condition of British prestige abroad at about\r\nthe time when her authority was being established in Australia. With her\r\narmy defeated in the Low Countries, her ships deeming it prudent to keep\r\nclear of the Cape that formed the key to her eastern and southern\r\npossessions, and her King's representative subjected to a studied slight\r\nfrom a Portuguese official in Brazil, she hardly appeared, just then, to\r\nbe the nation that would soon shatter the naval power of France, demolish\r\nthe greatest soldier of modern times, and, before her sword was sheathed,\r\nfloat her victorious flag in every continent, in every sea, and over\r\npeople of every race and colour.\r\n\r\nOn this voyage, as on all occasions, Flinders kept a careful record of\r\nhis own observations. Sixteen years later, a dispute arose, interesting\r\nto navigators, as to the precise location of Cape Frio in Brazil. An\r\nAmerican had pointed out an error in European charts. It was a matter of\r\nsome importance, because ships bound for Rio de Janeiro necessarily\r\nrounded Cape Frio, and the error was sufficiently serious to cause no\r\nsmall risk if vessels trusted to the received reckoning. The Naval\r\nChronicle devoted some attention to the point; and to it Flinders sent a\r\ncommunication stating that on consulting his nautical records he found\r\nthat on May 2nd, 1795, he made an observation, reduced from the preceding\r\nnoon, calculating the position of the Cape to be latitude 22 degrees 53\r\nminutes south, longitude 41 degrees 43 minutes west. His memorandum was\r\nprinted over a facsimile of his signature as that of \"a distinguished\r\nnavigator,\" and was hailed as \"a valuable contribution towards clearing\r\nup the difficulty concerning the geographical position of that important\r\nheadland.\"* (* Naval Chronicle Volume 26.) For us the incident serves as\r\nan indication of Flinders' diligence and carefulness in the study of\r\nnavigation. He was but a midshipman at the time, and it will be noticed\r\nthat it was a personal observation which he was able to quote, not one\r\ntaken as part of his duty as an officer.\r\n\r\nThe Reliance arrived at Port Jackson on September 7th, and in the\r\nfollowing month Flinders, with a companion of whom it is time to speak,\r\ncommenced the series of explorations which made his fame.\r\n\r\nThis companion was George Bass, a Lincolnshire man like Flinders himself,\r\nborn at Aswarby near Sleaford. He was a farmer's son, but his father died\r\nwhen he was quite a child, and his mother moved to Boston. She managed\r\nout of her widow's resources to give her son an excellent education, and\r\ndesigned that he should enter the medical profession. In due course he\r\nwas apprenticed to a Boston surgeon, Mr. Francis--a common mode of\r\nsecuring training in medicine at that period. He \"walked\" the Boston\r\nhospital for a finishing course of instruction, and won his surgeon's\r\ndiploma with marked credit.\r\n\r\nBass had from his early years shown a desire to go to sea. His mother was\r\nable to buy for him a share in a merchant ship; but this was wrecked,\r\nwhereupon, not cured of his love of the ocean, he entered the navy as a\r\nsurgeon. It was in that capacity that he sailed in the Reliance. He was\r\nthen, in 1795, thirty-two years of age.\r\n\r\nAll the records of Bass, both the personal observations of those who came\r\nin contact with him, and the tale of his own deeds, leave the impression\r\nthat he was a very remarkable man. He was six feet in height,\r\ndark-complexioned, handsome in countenance, keen in expression, vigorous,\r\nstrong, and enterprising. His father-in-law spoke of his \"very\r\npenetrating countenance.\" Flinders called him \"the penetrating Bass.\"\r\nGovernor Hunter, in official despatches, said he was \"a young man of a\r\nwell-informed mind and an active disposition,\" and one who was \"of much\r\nability in various ways out of the line of his profession.\" He was gifted\r\nwith a mind capable of intense application to any task that he took in\r\nhand. Upon his firm courage, resourcefulness and strength of purpose,\r\ndifficulties and dangers acted merely as the whetstone to the finely\r\ntempered blade. He undertook hazardous enterprises from the sheer love of\r\ndoing hard things which were worth doing. \"He was one,\" wrote Flinders,\r\n\"whose ardour for discovery was not to be repressed by any obstacle nor\r\ndeterred by danger.\" He seemed to care nothing for rewards, and was not\r\nhungry for honours. The pleasure of doing was to him its own recompense.\r\nThat \"penetrating countenance\" indexed a brain as direct as a drill, and\r\nas inflexible. A loyal and affectionate comrade, preferring to enter upon\r\na task with his chosen mate, he nevertheless could not wait inactive if\r\nofficial duties prevented co-operation, but would set out alone on any\r\npiece of work on which he had set his heart. The portrait of Bass which\r\nwe possess conveys an impression of alert and vigorous intelligence, of\r\ngenial temper and hearty relish. It is the picture of a man who was\r\nabundantly alive in every nerve.\r\n\r\nFlinders and Bass, being both Lincolnshire men, born within a few miles\r\nof each other, naturally became very friendly on the long voyage to\r\nAustralia. It was said of two other friends, who achieved great\r\ndistinction in the sphere of art, that when they first met in early\r\nmanhood they \"ran together like two drops of mercury,\" so completely\r\ncoincident were their inclinations. So it was in this instance. Two men\r\nmore predisposed to formulate plans for exploration could not have been\r\nthrown together. A passion for maritime discovery was common to both of\r\nthem. Flinders, from his study of charts and books of voyages, had a\r\nsound knowledge of the field of work that lay open, and Bass's keen mind\r\neagerly grasped the plans explained to him. It would not have taken the\r\nsurgeon and the midshipman long to find that their ambitions were\r\ncompletely in tune on this inviting subject. \"With this friend,\" Flinders\r\nwrote, \"a determination was found of completing the examination of the\r\neast coast of New South Wales by all such opportunities as the duty of\r\nthe ship and procurable means could admit. Projects of this nature, when\r\noriginating in the minds of young men, are usually termed romantic; and\r\nso far from any good being anticipated, even prudence and friendship join\r\nin discouraging, if not in opposing them. Thus it was in the present\r\ncase.\" The significance of that passage is that the two friends made for\r\nthemselves the opportunities by which they won fame and rendered service.\r\nThey did not wait on Fortune; they forced her hand. They showed by what\r\nthey did on their own initiative, with very limited resources, that they\r\nwere the right men to be entrusted with work of larger scope.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it is unwarrantable to assume that Governor Hunter\r\ndiscountenanced their earliest efforts. It was presumably on the passage\r\nquoted above that the author of a chapter in the most elaborate modern\r\nnaval history founded the assertion that \"the plans of the young\r\ndiscoverers were discouraged by the authorities. They, however, had\r\nresolution and perseverance. All official help and countenance were\r\nwithheld.\"* (* Sir Clements Markham in The Royal Navy, a History, 4 565.)\r\nBut Flinders does not say that \"the authorities\" discouraged the effort.\r\n\"Prudence and friendship\" did. They were not yet tried men in such\r\nhazardous enterprises; the settlement possessed scarcely any resources\r\nfor exploratory work, and the dangers were unknown. Official countenance\r\nimplies official responsibility, and there was not yet sufficient reason\r\nfor setting the Governor's seal on the adventurous experiments of two\r\nyoung and untried though estimable men. When they had shown their\r\nquality, Hunter gave them every assistance and encouragement in his\r\npower, and proved himself a good friend to them. In the circumstances,\r\n\"prudence and friendship\" are hardly to be blamed for a counsel of\r\ncaution. The remark of Flinders is not to be interpreted to mean that the\r\nGovernor put hindrances in their way. They were under his orders, and his\r\npositive discountenance would have been effectual to block their efforts.\r\nThey could not even have obtained leave of absence without his approval.\r\nBut John Hunter was not the man to prevent them from putting their powers\r\nto the test.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the two friends reached Sydney than they began to look\r\nabout them for means to undertake the exploratory work upon which their\r\nminds were bent. Bass had brought out with him from England a small boat,\r\nonly eight feet long, with a five foot beam, named by him the Tom Thumb\r\non account of her size.* (* Flinders' Papers \"Brief Memoir\" manuscripts\r\npage 5. Some have supposed the measurements given in Flinders' published\r\nwork to have been a misprint, the size of the boat being so absurdly\r\nsmall. But Flinders' Journal is quite clear on the point: \"We turned our\r\neyes towards a little boat of about 8 feet keel and 5 feet beam which had\r\nbeen brought out by Mr. Bass and others in the Reliance, and from its\r\nsize had obtained the name of Tom Thumb.\") In this diminutive craft the\r\ntwo friends made preparations for setting out along the Coast. Taking\r\nwith them only one boy, named Martin, with provisions and ammunition for\r\na very short trip, they sailed the Tom Thumb out of Port Jackson and made\r\nsouthward to Botany Bay, which they entered. They pushed up George's\r\nRiver, which had been only partly explored, and pursued their\r\ninvestigation of its winding course for twenty miles beyond the former\r\nlimit of survey. Upon their return they presented to Hunter a report\r\nconcerning the quality of the land seen on the borders of the river,\r\ntogether with a sketch map. The Governor was induced from what they told\r\nhim to examine the country himself; and the result was that he founded\r\nthe settlement of Bankstown, which still remains, and boasts the\r\ndistinction of being one of the pioneer towns of Australia.\r\n\r\nThe adventurers were delayed from the further pursuit of their ambition\r\nby ship's duties. The Reliance was ordered to convey to Norfolk Island an\r\nofficer of the New South Wales Corps required for duty there, as well as\r\nthe Judge Advocate. She sailed in January, 1796. After her return in\r\nMarch, Bass and Flinders, being free again, lost no time in fitting out\r\nfor a second cruise. Their object this time was to search for a large\r\nriver, said to fall into the sea to the south of Botany Bay, which was\r\nnot marked on Cook's chart. As before, the crew consisted only of\r\nthemselves and the boy.\r\n\r\nIt has always been believed that the boat in which this second cruise was\r\nmade, was the same Tom Thumb as that which carried the two young\r\nexplorers to George's River; indeed, Flinders himself, in his Voyage to\r\nTerra Australis, Volume 1, page 97, says that \"Mr. Bass and myself went\r\nagain in Tom Thumb.\" But in his unpublished Journal there is a passage\r\nthat suggests a doubt as to whether, when he wrote his book, over a\r\ndecade later, he had not forgotten that a second boat was obtained for\r\nthe second adventure. He may not have considered the circumstance\r\nimportant enough to mention. At all events in the Journal, he writes: \"As\r\nTom Thumb had performed so well before, the same boat's crew had little\r\nhesitation in embarking in another boat of nearly the same size, which\r\nhad been since built at Port Jackson.\" There was, it is evident, a second\r\nboat, no larger than the first, or that fact would have been mentioned,\r\nand she was also known as the Tom Thumb. She was Tom Thumb the Second.\r\nOnly by that assumption can we reconcile the Voyage statement with the\r\nJournal, which, having been written up at the time, is an authoritative\r\nsource of information.\r\n\r\nThey left Sydney on March 25th, intending to stand off to sea till\r\nevening, when it was expected that the breeze would bring them to the\r\ncoast. But they drifted on a strong current six or seven miles southward,\r\nand being unable to land, passed the night in the boat. Next day, being\r\nin want of water, but unable to bring the Tom Thumb to a safe landing\r\nplace, Bass swam ashore. While the filled cask was being got off a wave\r\ncarried the boat shoreward and beached her, leaving the three on the\r\nbeach with their clothes drenched, their provisions partly spoiled, and\r\ntheir arms and ammunition thoroughly wet. The emptying and launching of\r\nthe boat on a surfy shore, and the replacing of the stores and cask in\r\nher, were managed with some difficulty; and they ran for two islands for\r\nshelter late in the afternoon. Finding a landing to be dangerous they\r\nagain spent the night, cramped, damp, and uncomfortable, in their tossing\r\nlittle eight-foot craft, with their stone anchor dropped under the lee of\r\na tongue of land. Bass could not sleep because, from having for so many\r\nhours during the day had his naked body exposed to the burning sun, he\r\nwas \"one continued blister.\" On the third day they took aboard two\r\naboriginals--\"two Indians,\" Flinders calls them--natives of Botany Bay,\r\nwho offered to pilot them to a place where they could obtain not only\r\nwater but also fish and wild duck.\r\n\r\nThey were conducted to a small stream descending from a lagoon, and rowed\r\nup it for about a mile until it became too shallow to proceed. Eight or\r\nten aboriginals put in an appearance, and Bass and Flinders began to\r\nentertain doubts of securing a retreat from these people should they be\r\ninclined to be hostile. \"They had the reputation at Port Jackson of being\r\nexceedingly ferocious, if not cannibals.\"\r\n\r\nThe powder having become wet and the muskets rusty, Bass and Flinders\r\ndecided to land in order that they might spread their ammunition in the\r\nsun to dry, and clean their weapons. The natives, who increased in number\r\nto about twenty, gathered round and watched with curiosity. Some of them\r\nassisted Bass in repairing a broken oar. They did not know what the\r\npowder was, but, when the muskets were handled, so much alarm was excited\r\nthat it was necessary to desist. Some of them had doubtless learnt from\r\naboriginals about Port Jackson of the thunder and lightning made by these\r\nmysterious pieces of wood and metal, and had had described to them how\r\nblackfellows dropped dead when such things pointed and smoked at them.\r\nFlinders, anxious to retain their confidence (because, had they assumed\r\nthe offensive, they must speedily have annihilated the three whites), hit\r\nupon an amusing method of diverting them. The aboriginals were accustomed\r\nto wear their coarse black hair and beards hanging in long, shaggy,\r\nuntrimmed locks, matted with accretions of oil and dirt. When the two\r\nBotany Bay blacks were taken on board the Tom Thumb as pilots, a pair of\r\nscissors was applied to their abundant and too emphatically odorous\r\ntresses. Flinders tells the rest of the story:\r\n\r\n\"We had clipped the hair and beards of the two Botany Bay natives at Red\r\nPoint,* (* Near Port Kembla; named by Cook.) and they were showing\r\nthemselves to the others and persuading them to follow their example.\r\nWhilst therefore the powder was drying, I began with a large pair of\r\nscissors to execute my new office upon the eldest of four or five chins\r\npresented to me, and as great nicety was not required, the shaving of a\r\ndozen of them did not occupy me long. Some of the more timid were alarmed\r\nat a formidable instrument coming so near to their noses, and would\r\nscarcely be persuaded by their shaven friends to allow the operation to\r\nbe finished. But when their chins were held up a second time, their fear\r\nof the instrument, the wild stare of their eyes, and the smile which they\r\nforced, formed a compound upon the rough savage countenance not unworthy\r\nthe pencil of a Hogarth. I was almost tempted to try what effect a little\r\nsnip would produce; but our situation was too critical to admit of such\r\nexperiments.\"\r\n\r\nFlinders treats the incident lightly, and as a means of creating a\r\ndiversion while preparing a retreat it was useful; but it can hardly be\r\nsupposed to have been an agreeable occupation to barber a group of\r\naboriginals. What the heads were like that received Flinders'\r\nministrations, may be gathered from the description by Clarke, the\r\nsupercargo of the wrecked Sydney Cove, concerning the natives whom he\r\nencountered in the following year (March 1797): \"Their hair is long and\r\nstraight, but they are wholly inattentive to it, either as to cleanliness\r\nor in any other respect. It serves them in lieu of a towel to wipe their\r\nhands as often as they are daubed with blubber or shark oil, which is\r\ntheir principal article of food. This frequent application of rancid\r\ngrease to their heads and bodies renders their approach exceedingly\r\noffensive.\"\r\n\r\nBut the adventure, by putting the blacks into a good humour, enabled Bass\r\nand Flinders to collect their dried powder, obtain fresh water, and get\r\nback to their boat. The natives became vociferous for them to go up to\r\nthe lagoon, but the natives \"dragged her along down the stream shouting\r\nand singing,\" until the depth of water placed them in safety. Flinders,\r\nin his Journal, expressed the view that \"we were perhaps considerably\r\nindebted for the fear the natives entertained of us to an old red jacket\r\nwhich Mr. Bass wore, and from which they took us to be soldiers, whom\r\nthey were particularly afraid of; and though we did not much admire our\r\nnew name, Soja, we thought it best not to undeceive them.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 25 they anchored \"under the innermost of the northern\r\nislets...We called these Martin's Isles after our young companion in the\r\nboat.\"* (* Journal.)\r\n\r\nThey were now in the Illawarra district, one of the most prolific in New\r\nSouth Wales;* (* McFarlane, Illawarra and Monaro, Sydney 1872 page 8.)\r\nand the observation of Flinders that the land they saw was \"probably\r\nfertile, and the slopes of the back hills had certainly that appearance,\"\r\nhas been richly justified by a century's experience.\r\n\r\nThe two friends and their boy had to remain on the Tom Thumb for a third\r\nnight; but next afternoon (March 28) they were able to land unmolested,\r\nto cook a meal, and to take some rest on the shore. \"The sandy beach was\r\nour bed, and after much fatigue and passing three nights of cramp in Tom\r\nThumb it was to us a bed of down.\"\r\n\r\nAt about ten o'clock at night, on March 29th, the little craft was in\r\nextreme danger of foundering in a gale. The anchor had been cast under\r\nthe lee of a range of cliffs, but the situation was insecure, so that\r\nBass and Flinders considered it prudent to haul up the stone and run\r\nbefore the wind. The night was dark, the wind burst in a gale, and the\r\nadventurers had no knowledge of any place of security to which they could\r\nrun. The frowning cliffs above them and the smashing of the surf on the\r\nrocks, were their guide in steering a course parallel with the coast.\r\nBass held the sheet, Flinders steered with an oar, and the boy bailed out\r\nthe water which the hissing crests of wind-lashed waves flung into the\r\nboat. \"It required the utmost exertion to prevent broaching to; a single\r\nwrong movement or a moment's inattention would have sent us to the\r\nbottom.\"\r\n\r\nThey drove along for an hour in this precarious situation, hoping for an\r\nopening to reveal itself into which they could run for shelter. At last,\r\nFlinders, straining his eyes in the darkness, distinguished right ahead\r\nsome high breakers, behind which there appeared to be no shade of cliffs.\r\nSo extremely perilous was their position at this time, with the water\r\nincreasing despite the efforts of the boy, that Flinders, an unusually\r\nplacid and matter-of-fact writer when dealing with dangers of the sea,\r\ndeclares that they could not have lived ten minutes longer. On the\r\ninstant he determined to turn the boat's head for these breakers, hoping\r\nthat behind them, as there were no high cliffs, there might be sheltered\r\nwater. The boat's head was brought to the wind, the sail and mast were\r\ntaken down, and the oars were got out. \"Pulling thus towards the reef,\r\nthrough the intervals of the heaviest seas, we found it to terminate in a\r\npoint, and in three minutes were in smooth water under its lee. A white\r\nappearance further back kept us a short time in suspense, but a nearer\r\napproach showed it to be the beach of a well-sheltered cove, under which\r\nwe anchored for the rest of the night.\" They called the place of refuge\r\nProvidential Cove. The native name was Watta-Mowlee (it is now called\r\nWattamolla).\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, March 30th, the weather having moderated, the\r\nTom Thumb's sail was again hoisted, and she coasted northward. After a\r\nprogress of three or four miles, Flinders and Bass found the entrance of\r\nPort Hacking, for the exploration of which they had made this cruise. It\r\nwas a much-indented inlet directly south of Botany Bay, divided from it\r\nby a broad peninsula, and receiving at its head the waters of a wide\r\nriver, besides several small creeks; and was named after Henry Hacking, a\r\npilot who had indicated its whereabouts, having come near it \"in his\r\nkangaroo-hunting excursions.\" The two young explorers spent the better\r\npart of two days in examining the neighbourhood; and anyone who has had\r\nthe good fortune to traverse that piece of country, with its grassed\r\nglades, its timbered hillsides, its exquisite glimpses of sapphire sea\r\nand cool silver river, its broken and diversified surface, rich with\r\nfloral colour--for they saw it in early autumn--can realise how satisfied\r\nthey must have felt with their work. After a nine days' voyage, they\r\nsailed out of Port Hacking early on April 2nd, and, aided by a fine wind,\r\ndrew up alongside the Reliance in Port Jackson on the evening of the same\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe Reliance was an old and leaky ship. She had seen much service and was\r\nbadly in need of repairs. \"She is so extremely weak in her whole frame\r\nthat it is in our situation a difficult matter to do what is necessary,\"\r\nwrote Hunter to the Secretary of State. Shipwrights' conveniences could\r\nhardly be expected to be ample in a settlement that was not yet ten years\r\nold, and where skilled labour was necessarily deficient. But she had to\r\nbe repaired with the best material and direction available, for she was\r\nthe best ship which His Majesty's representative had at his disposal. The\r\nSupply was pretty well beyond renovation. She was American built, and her\r\ntimbers of black birch were never suitable for service in warm waters.\r\nShortly after the discovery of Port Hacking, Hunter set about the\r\noverhauling of the vessel that was at once his principal means of naval\r\ndefence, his saluting battery, his official inspecting ship, his\r\ntransport, and his craft of all work. He wanted her especially just now,\r\nfor a useful piece of colonial service.\r\n\r\nThe Governor had received intelligence from Major-General Craig, who had\r\ncommanded the land forces when Admiral Elphinstone occupied the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, that a British protectorate had been established at that very\r\nimportant station. As Hunter had himself made the suggestion to the\r\nGovernment that such a step should be taken, the news was especially\r\ngratifying to him. Amongst his instructions from the Secretary of State\r\nwas a direction to procure from South Africa live cattle for stocking the\r\ninfant colony. He had brought out with him, at Sir Joseph Banks'\r\nsuggestion, a supply of growing vegetables for transplantation and of\r\nseeds for sowing at appropriate seasons. He now set about obtaining the\r\nlive stock.\r\n\r\nThe Reliance and the Supply sailed by way of Cape Horn to South Africa,\r\nwhere they took on board a supply of domestic animals. The former vessel\r\ncarried 109 head of cattle, 107 sheep and three mares. Some of the\r\nofficers brought live stock on their own account. Thus Bass had on board\r\na cow and nineteen sheep, and Waterhouse had enough stock to start a\r\nsmall farm; but it does not appear that Flinders brought any animals. \"I\r\nbelieve no ship ever went to sea so much lumbered,\" wrote Captain\r\nWaterhouse; and the unpleasantness of the voyage can be imagined, apart\r\nfrom that officer's assurance that it was \"one of the longest and most\r\ndisagreeable passages I ever made.\" The vessels left Cape Town for Sydney\r\non April 11th, 1797. The Supply was so wretchedly leaky that it was\r\nconsidered positively unsafe for her to risk the voyage. But her\r\ncommander, Lieutenant William Kent, had a high sense of duty, and his\r\ncourage was guided by the fine seamanship characteristic of the service.\r\nHaving in view the importance to the colony of the stock he had on board,\r\nhe determined to run her through. As a matter of fact, the Supply arrived\r\nin Sydney forty-one days before the Reliance (May 16), though Hunter\r\nreported that she reached port \"in a most distressed and dangerous\r\ncondition,\" and would never be fit for sea again. Kent's memory is\r\nworthily preserved on the map of Australia by the name (given by Flinders\r\nor by Hunter himself) of the Kent group of islands at the eastern\r\nentrance of Bass Strait.\r\n\r\nThe Reliance, meeting with very bad weather, made a very slow passage.\r\nCaptain Waterhouse mentioned that one fierce gale was \"the most terrible\r\nI ever saw or heard of,\" so that he \"expected to go to the bottom every\r\nmoment.\" He wondered how they escaped destruction, but rounded off his\r\ndescription with a seaman's joke: \"possibly I may be intended to be hung\r\nin room of being drowned.\" The ship was very leaky all the way, and\r\nHunter reported that she returned to port with her pumps going. She\r\nreached Sydney on June 26th.\r\n\r\nThe unseaworthy condition of the Reliance had an important bearing on the\r\nshare Flinders took in Australian discovery, for it was unquestionably in\r\nconsequence of his being engaged upon her repair that he was prevented\r\nfrom accompanying his friend Bass on the expedition which led to the\r\ndiscovery of Bass Strait. This statement is proved not only by the\r\ntestimony of Flinders himself, but by concurrent facts. Waterhouse wrote\r\non the return of the ship to Port Jackson, \"we have taken everything out\r\nof her in hopes of repairing her.\" This was in the latter part of 1797. A\r\ndespatch from Hunter to the British Government in January, 1798, shows\r\nthat at that time she was still being patched up. Flinders recorded that\r\n\"the great repairs required by the Reliance would not allow of my\r\nabsence,\" but that \"my friend Mr. Bass, less confined by his duty, made\r\nseveral excursions.\" Finally, it was on December 3rd, 1797, while the\r\nrefitting was in progress, that Bass started out on the adventurous\r\nvoyage which led to the discovery of the stretch of water separating\r\nTasmania from the mainland of Australia. But for the work on the\r\nReliance, there cannot be the shadow of a doubt that Flinders would have\r\nbeen with him. Duty had to be done, however; the \"ugly commanded work,\"\r\nin which, as the sage reminds us, genius has to do its part in common\r\nwith more ordinary mortals, made demands that must take precedence of\r\nadventurous cruising along unknown coasts. So it was that the cobbling of\r\na debilitated tub separated on an historic occasion two brave and loyal\r\nfriends whose names will be thought of together as long as British people\r\ntreasure the memory of their choice and daring spirits.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. THE DISCOVERY OF BASS STRAIT.\r\n\r\nThe patching up of the Reliance not being surgeon's work, Bass, throbbing\r\nwith energy, looked about him for some useful employment. The whole of\r\nthe New South Wales settlement at this time consisted of an oblong--the\r\ntown of Sydney itself--on the south side of Port Jackson, a few sprawling\r\npaddocks on either side of the fang-like limbs of the harbour, some small\r\npieces of cultivated land further west, at and beyond Parramatta, and a\r\ncultivable area to the north-west on the banks of the Hawkesbury River. A\r\nsketch-map prepared by Hunter, in 1796, illustrates these very small\r\nearly attempts of the settlement to spread. They show up against the\r\npaper like a few specks of lettuce leaf upon a white table cloth. The\r\nlarge empty spaces are traversed by red lines, principally to the\r\nsouth-west, marking \"country which has been lately walked over.\" The red\r\nlines end abruptly on the far side of a curve in the course of the river\r\nNepean, where swamps and hills are shown. The map-maker \"saw a bull\" near\r\na hill which was called Mount Hunter, and marked it down.\r\n\r\nWest of the settlement, behind Richmond Hill on the Hawkesbury, the map\r\nindicated a mountain range. Bass's first effort at independent\r\nexploration was an endeavour to find a pass through these mountains. The\r\nneed was seen to be imminent. As the colony grew, the limits of\r\noccupation would press up to the foot of this blue range, which, with its\r\nprecipitous walls, its alluring openings leading to stark faces of rock,\r\nits sharp ridges breaking to sheer ravines, its dense scrub and timber,\r\ndefied the energies of successive explorers. Governor Phillip, in 1789,\r\nreached Richmond by way of the Hawkesbury. Later in the same year, and in\r\nthe next, further efforts were made, but the investigators were beaten by\r\nthe stern and shaggy hills. Captain William Paterson, in 1793, organized\r\nan attacking party, consisting largely of Scottish highlanders, hoping\r\nthat their native skill and resolution would find a path across the\r\nbarrier; but they proceeded by boat only, and did not go far. In the\r\nfollowing year quartermaster Hacking, with a party of hardy men, spent\r\nten days among the mountains, but no path or pass practicable for traffic\r\nrewarded his endeavours. Sydney was shut in between the sea and this\r\ncraggy rampart. What the country on the other side was like no man knew.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1796, before the Reliance sailed for South Africa, George Bass\r\nmade his try. The task was hard, and worth attempting, two qualifications\r\nwhich recommended it strongly to his mind. He collected a small party of\r\nmen upon whom he could rely for a tough struggle, took provisions for\r\nabout a fortnight, equipped himself with strong ropes with which to be\r\nlowered down ravines, had scaling irons made for his feet, and hooks to\r\nfasten on his hands, and set out ready to cut or climb his way over the\r\nmountains, determined to assail their defiant fastnesses up to the limits\r\nof possibility. It was a stiff enterprise, and Bass and his party did not\r\nspare themselves. But the Blue Mountains were a fortress that was not to\r\nbe taken by storm. Bass's success, as Flinders wrote, \"was not\r\ncommensurate to the perseverance and labour employed.\" After fifteen days\r\nof effort, the baffled adventurers confessed themselves beaten, and,\r\ntheir provisions being exhausted, returned to Sydney.\r\n\r\nThey had pushed research further than any previous explorers had done,\r\nand had marked down the course of the river Grose as a practical result\r\nof their work. But Bass now believed the mountains to be hopeless; and,\r\nindeed, George Caley, a botanical collector employed by Sir Joseph Banks,\r\nhaving seven years later made another attempt and met with repulse, did\r\nnot hesitate to tell a committee of the House of Commons, which summoned\r\nhim to appear as a witness, that the range was impassable. It seemed that\r\nNature had tumbled down an impenetrable bewilderment of rock, the\r\nhillsides cracking into deep, dark crevices, and the crests of the\r\nmountains showing behind and beyond a massed confusion of crags and\r\nhollows, trackless and untraversable. Governor King declared himself\r\nsatisfied that the effort to cross the range was a task \"as chimerical as\r\nuseless,\" an opinion strengthened by the fact that, as Allan Cunningham\r\nhad related,* the aboriginals known to the settlement were \"totally\r\nignorant of any pass to the interior.\" (* On \"Progress of Interior\r\nDiscovery in New South Wales,\" Journal of the Royal Geographical Society\r\n1832 Volume 2 99.)\r\n\r\nIt was not, indeed, till 1813 that Gregory Blaxland, with Lieutenant\r\nLawson and William Charles Wentworth (then a youth), as companions,\r\nsucceeded in solving the problem. The story of their steady, persistent,\r\nand desperate struggle being beyond the scope of this biography, it is\r\nsufficient to say that after fifteen days of severe labour, applied with\r\nrare intelligence and bushcraft, they saw beneath them waving\r\ngrass-country watered by clear streams, and knew that they had found a\r\npath to the interior of the new continent.\r\n\r\nBass's eagerness to explore soon found other scope. In 1797, report was\r\nbrought to Sydney by shipwrecked mariners that, in traversing the coast,\r\nthey had seen coal. He at once set off to investigate. At the place now\r\ncalled Coalcliff, about twenty miles south of Botany Bay, he found a vein\r\nof coal about twenty feet above the surface of the sea. It was six or\r\nseven feet thick, and dipped to the southward until it became level with\r\nthe sea, \"and there the lowest rock you can see when the surf retires is\r\nall coal.\" It was a discovery of first-class importance--the first\r\nconsiderable find of a mineral that has yielded incalculable wealth to\r\nAustralia.* (* It is well to remember that the use of coal was discovered\r\nin England in very much the same way. Mr. Salzmann, English Industries of\r\nthe Middle Ages, 1913 page 3, observes that \"it is most probable that the\r\nfirst coal used was washed up by the sea, and such as could be quarried\r\nfrom the face of the cliffs where the seams were exposed by the action of\r\nthe waves.\" He quotes a sixteenth century account relative to Durham: \"As\r\nthe tide comes in it bringeth a small wash sea coal, which is employed to\r\nthe making of salt and the fuel of the poor fisher towns adjoining.\"\r\nHence, originally, coal in England was commonly called sea-coal even when\r\nobtained inland.) He made this useful piece of investigation in August;\r\nand in the following month undertook a journey on foot, in company with\r\nWilliamson, the acting commissary, from Sydney to the Cowpastures,\r\ncrossing and re-crossing the River Nepean, and thence descending to the\r\nsea a few miles south of his old resting place, Watta-Mowlee. His map and\r\nnotes are full of evidence of his careful observation. \"Tolerably good\r\nlevel ground,\" \"good pastures,\" \"mountainous brushy land,\" and so forth,\r\nare remarks scored across his track line. But these were pastimes in\r\ncomparison with the enterprise that was now occupying his mind, and upon\r\nwhich his fame chiefly rests.\r\n\r\nHunter's despatch to the Duke of Portland, dated March 1st, 1798,\r\nexplains the circumstances of the expedition leading to the discovery of\r\nBass Strait: \"The tedious repairs which His Majesty's ship Reliance\r\nnecessarily required before she could be put in a condition for going\r\nagain to sea, having given an opportunity to Mr. George Bass, her\r\nsurgeon, a young man of a well-informed mind and an active disposition,\r\nto offer himself to be employed in any way in which he could contribute\r\nto the benefit of the public service, I enquired of him in what way he\r\nwas desirous of exerting himself, and he informed me nothing would\r\ngratify him more effectually than my allowing him the use of a good boat\r\nand permitting him to man her with volunteers from the King's ships. I\r\naccordingly furnished him with an excellent whaleboat, well fitted,\r\nvictualled, and manned to his wish, for the purpose of examining the\r\ncoast to the southward of this port, as far as he could with safety and\r\nconvenience go.\"\r\n\r\nIt is clear from this despatch that the impulse was Bass's own, and that\r\nthe Governor merely supplied the boat, provisioned it, and permitted him\r\nto select his own crew. Hunter gave Bass full credit for what he did, and\r\nhimself applied the name to the Strait when its existence had been\r\ndemonstrated. It is, however, but just to Hunter to observe, that he had\r\neight years before printed the opinion that there was either a strait or\r\na deep gulf between Van Diemen's Land and New Holland. In his Historical\r\nJournal of the Transactions at Port Jackson and Norfolk Island (London,\r\n1793), he gave an account of the voyage of the Sirius, in 1789, from Port\r\nJackson to the Cape of Good Hope to purchase provisions. In telling the\r\nstory of the return voyage he wrote (page 125):\r\n\r\n\"In passing at a distance from the coast between the islands of Schooten\r\nand Furneaux and Point Hicks, the former being the northernmost of\r\nCaptain Furneaux's observations here, and the latter the southernmost\r\npart which Captain Cook saw when he sailed along the coast, there has\r\nbeen no land seen, and from our having felt an easterly set of current\r\nand when the wind was from that quarter (north-west), we had an uncommon\r\nlarge sea, there is reason to believe that there is in that space either\r\na very deep gulf or a strait, which may separate Van Diemen's Land from\r\nNew Holland. There have no discoveries been made on the western side of\r\nthis land in the parallel I allude to, between 39 and 42 degrees south,\r\nthe land there having never been seen.\"\r\n\r\nHunter was, therefore, quite justified, in his despatch, in pointing out\r\nthat he had \"long conjectured\" the existence of the Strait. He seems, not\r\nunwarrantably, to have been anxious that his own share in the\r\ndiscoveries, as foreseeing them and encouraging the efforts that led to\r\nthem, should not be overlooked. The Naval Chronicle of the time mentioned\r\nthe subject, and returned to it more than once.* (* See Naval Chronicle\r\nVolume 4 159 (1800); Volume 6 349 (1801); Volume 15 62 (1806), etc.) But\r\nif we may suppose Hunter to have inspired some of these allusions, it\r\nmust be added that they are scrupulously fair, and claimed no more for\r\nhim than he was entitled to have remembered. Bass's work is in every\r\ninstance properly appreciated; and in one article (Naval Chronicle 15 62)\r\nhe is characterised, probably through Hunter's instrumentality--the\r\nlanguage is very like that used in the official despatch--as \"a man of\r\nconsiderable enterprise and ingenuity, a strong and comprehensive mind\r\nwith the advantage of a vigorous body and healthy constitution.\" The boat\r\nwas 28 feet 7 inches long, head and stern alike, fitted to row eight\r\noars, with banksia timbers and cedar planking.\r\n\r\nOne error relating to this justly celebrated voyage needs to be\r\ncorrected, especially as currency has been given to it in a standard\r\nhistorical work. It is not true that Bass undertook his cruise \"in a\r\nsailing boat with a crew of five convicts.* (* The Royal Navy: a History\r\nVolume 4 567.) His men were all British sailors. Hunter's despatch\r\nindicates that Bass asked to be allowed to man his boat \"with volunteers\r\nfrom the King's ships,\" and that she was \"manned to his wish,\" and\r\nFlinders, in his narrative of the voyage, stated that his friend was\r\n\"furnished with a fine whaleboat, and six weeks' provisions by the\r\nGovernor, and a crew of six seamen from the ships.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, much to be regretted that, with one exception to be\r\nmentioned in a later chapter, the names of the seamen who participated in\r\nthis remarkable cruise have not been preserved. Bass had no occasion in\r\nhis diary to mention any man by name, but it is quite evident that they\r\nwere a daring, enduring, well-matched and thoroughly loyal band, facing\r\nthe big waters in their small craft with heroic resolution, and never\r\nfailing to respond when their chief gave a lead. When, after braving foul\r\nweather, and with food supplies running low, the boat was at length\r\nturned homeward, Bass writes \"we did it reluctantly,\" coupling his\r\nwilling little company with himself in regrets that discovery could not\r\nbe pushed farther than they had been able to pursue it. Throughout his\r\ndiary he writes in the first person plural, and he records no instance of\r\ncomplaint of the hardships endured or of quailing before the dangers\r\nencountered.\r\n\r\nIt is likely enough that the six British sailors who manned Bass's boat\r\nhad very little perception that they were engaged upon a task that would\r\nshine in history. An energetic ship's surgeon whom everybody liked had\r\ncalled for volunteers in an affair requiring stout arms and hearts. He\r\ngot them, they followed him, did their job, and returned to routine duty.\r\nThey did not receive any extra pay, or promotion, or official\r\nrecognition. Neither did Bass, beyond Hunter's commendation in a\r\ndespatch. He wrote up his modest little diary, a terse record of\r\nobservations and occurrences, and got ready for the next adventure.\r\n\r\nWe will follow him on this one.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of Sunday, December 3, 1797, at six o'clock, Bass's men\r\nrowed out of Port Jackson heads and turned south. The night was spent in\r\nLittle Bay, three miles north of Botany Bay, as Bass did not deem it\r\nprudent to proceed further in the darkness, the weather having become\r\ncloudy and uncertain, and things not having yet found their proper place\r\nin the boat. Nor was very much progress made on the 4th, for a violent\r\nwind was encountered, which caused Bass to make for Port Hacking. On the\r\nfollowing day, \"the wind headed in flurries,\" and the boat did not get\r\nfurther than Providential Cove, or Watta-mowley, where the Tom Thumb had\r\ntaken refuge in the previous year. On the 7th, Bass reached Shoalhaven,\r\nwhich he named. He remained there three days, and described the soil and\r\nsituation with some care. \"The country around it is generally low and\r\nswampy and the soil for the most part is rich and good, but seemingly\r\nmuch subject to extensive inundation.\" One sentence of comment reads\r\ncuriously now that the district is linked up by railway with Sydney, and\r\nexports its butter and other produce to the markets of Europe. \"However\r\ncapable much of the soil of this country might upon a more accurate\r\ninvestigation be found to be of agricultural improvement, certain it is\r\nthat the difficulty of shipping off the produce must ever remain a bar to\r\nits colonisation. A nursery of cattle might perhaps be carried on here\r\nwith advantage, and that sort of produce ships off itself.\" Bass, a\r\nfarmer's son, reared in an agricultural centre, was a capable judge of\r\ngood country, but of course there was nothing when he saw these rich\r\nlands to foretell an era of railways and refrigerating machinery.\r\n\r\nOn December 10th the boat entered Jervis Bay, and on the 18th Bass\r\ndiscovered Barmouth Creek (probably the mouth of the Bega River), \"the\r\nprettiest little model of a harbour we had ever seen.\" Were it not for\r\nthe shallowness of the bar, he considered that the opening would be \"a\r\ncomplete harbour for small craft;\" but as things were, \"a small boat even\r\nmust watch her times for going in.\" On the 19th, at seven o'clock in the\r\nmorning, Twofold Bay was discovered. Bass sailed round it, made a sketch\r\nof it, and put to sea again, thinking it better to leave the place for\r\nfurther examination on the return voyage, and to take advantage of the\r\nfair wind for the southward course. He considered the nautical advantages\r\nof the harbour--to become in later years a rather important centre for\r\nwhaling--superior to those of any other anchorage entered during the\r\nvoyage. A landmark was indicated by him with a quaint touch: \"It may be\r\nknown by a red point on the south side, of the peculiar bluish hue of a\r\ndrunkard's nose.\" On the following day at about eleven o'clock in the\r\nmorning he rounded Cape Howe, and commenced his westerly run. He was now\r\nnearing a totally new stretch of coast.\r\n\r\nFrom the 22nd to the 30th bad weather was experienced. A gale blew\r\nsouth-west by west, full in their teeth. The situation must have been\r\nuncomfortable in the extreme, for the boat was now entering the Strait.\r\nThe heavy seas that roll under the lash of a south-west gale in that\r\nquarter do not make for the felicity of those who face them on a\r\nwell-found modern steamer. For the seven Englishmen in an open boat,\r\ngroping along a strange coast, the ordeal was severe. But no doubt they\r\nwished each other a merry Christmas, in quite the traditional English\r\nway, and with hearty good feeling, on the 25th.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the year, in more moderate weather, the boat was\r\ncoasting the Ninety Mile Beach, behind the sandy fringe of which lay the\r\nfat pastures of eastern Gippsland. The country did not look very\r\npromising to Bass from the sea, and he minuted his impressions in a few\r\nwords: \"low beaches at the bottom of heights of no great depth, lying\r\nbetween rocky projecting points; in the back lay some short ridges of\r\nlumpy irregular hills at a little distance from the sea.\"\r\n\r\nNowhere in his diary did Bass seize upon any picturesque features of\r\nscenery, though they are not lacking in the region that he traversed. If\r\nhe was moved by a sense of the oppressiveness of vast, silent solitudes,\r\nor by any sensation of strangeness at feeling his way along a coast\r\nhitherto unexplored, the emotion finds scarcely any reflection in his\r\nrecord. Hard facts, dates, times, positions, and curt memoranda, were the\r\nsole concern of the diarist. He did not even mention a pathetic, almost\r\ntragic, incident of the voyage, to which reference will presently be\r\nmade. It did not concern the actual exploratory part of his work, and so\r\nhe passed it by. The one note signifying an appreciation of the\r\nsingularity of the position is conveyed in the terse words: \"Sunday 31st,\r\na.m. Daylight, got out and steered along to the southward, in anxious\r\nexpectation, being now nearly come upon an hitherto unknown part of the\r\ncoast.\"\r\n\r\nBut men are emotional beings after all, and an entry for \"January 1st,\r\n1798\" (really the evening of December 31), bare of the human touch as it\r\nis, brings the situation of Bass and his crew vividly before the eye of\r\nthe reader. The dramatic force of it must have been keenly realised by\r\nthem. At night there was \"bright moonlight, the sky without a cloud.\" A\r\nnew year was dawning. The seven Englishmen tossing on the waves in this\r\nsolitary part of the globe would not fail to remember that. They were\r\nnear enough to the land to see it distinctly; it was \"still low and\r\nlevel.\" A flood of soft light lay upon it, and rippled silvery over the\r\nsea. They would hear the wash of the rollers that climb that bevelled\r\nshore, and pile upon the water-line creaming leagues of phosphorescent\r\nfoam. And at the back lay a land of mystery, almost as tenantless as the\r\nmoon herself, but to be the future home of prosperous thousands of the\r\nsame race as the men in the whaleboat. To them it was a country of weird\r\nforms, strange animals, and untutored savages. If ever boat breasted the\r\n\"foam of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn,\" it was this, and if ever\r\nits occupants realised the complete strangeness of their situation and\r\ntheir utter aloofness from the tracks of their fellowmen, it must have\r\nbeen on this cloudless moonlit summer night. There was hardly a stretch\r\nof the world's waters, at all events in any habitable zone, where they\r\ncould have been farther away from all that they remembered with affection\r\nand hoped to see again. About half an hour before midnight a haze dimmed\r\nthe distinctness of the shore, and at midnight it had thickened so that\r\nthey could scarcely see land at all. But they crept along in their\r\ncourse, \"vast flights of petrels and other birds flying about us,\" the\r\nwatch peering into the mist, the rest wrapped in their blankets sleeping,\r\nwhile the stars shone down on them from a brilliant steel-blue sky, and\r\nthe Cross wheeled high above the southern horizon.\r\n\r\nCook, on his Endeavour voyage in 1770, first sighted the Australian coast\r\nat Point Hicks, called Cape Everard on many current maps. His second\r\nofficer, Lieutenant Zachary Hicks, at six in the morning of April 20,\r\n\"saw ye land making high,\" and Cook \"named it Point Hicks because\r\nLieutenant Hicks was the first who discovered this land.\" Point Hicks is\r\na projection which falls away landward from a peak, backed by a sandy\r\nconical hill, but Bass passed it without observing it. The thick haze\r\nwhich he mentions may have obscured the outline. At all events, by dusk\r\non January 1st he found that he had filled up the hitherto unexplored\r\nspace between Point Hicks \"a point we could not at all distinguish from\r\nthe rest of the beach,\" and the high hummocky land further west, which he\r\nbelieved to be that sighted by Captain Tobias Furneaux in 1773. It is,\r\nhowever, to be observed that Flinders pointed out that all Bass's\r\nreckonings after December 31st were ten miles out. \"It is no matter of\r\nsurprise,\" wrote his friend indicating an error, \"if observations taken\r\nfrom an open boat in a high sea should differ ten miles from the truth;\r\nbut I judge that Mr. Bass's quadrant must have received some injury\r\nduring the night of the 31st, for a similar error appears to pervade all\r\nthe future observations, even those taken under favourable\r\ncircumstances.\" The missing of Point Hicks, therefore, apart from the\r\nthick haze, is not difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, January 2nd, Bass reached the most southerly point in the\r\ncontinent of Australia, the extremity of Wilson's Promontory. The bold\r\noutlines were sighted at seven o'clock in the morning. \"We were surprised\r\nby the sight of high hummocky land right ahead, and at a considerable\r\ndistance.\" Bass called it Furneaux Land in his diary, in the belief that\r\na portion of the great granite peninsula had been seen by the captain of\r\nthe Adventure in 1773. Furneaux' name is still attached to the group of\r\nislands divided by Banks' Strait from the north-east corner of Tasmania.\r\nBut the name which Bass gave to the Promontory was not retained. It is\r\nnot likely that Furneaux ever saw land so far west. \"It cannot be the\r\nsame, as Mr. Bass was afterwards convinced,\" wrote Flinders. Governor\r\nHunter, \"at our recommendation,\" named it Wilson's Promontory, \"in\r\ncompliment to my friend Thomas Wilson, Esq., of London.\" It has been\r\nstated that the name was given to commemorate William Wilson, one of the\r\nwhaleboat crew, who \"jumped ashore first.\"* (* Ida Lee, The Coming of the\r\nBritish to Australia, London 1906 page 51.) Nobody \"jumped ashore first\"\r\non the westward voyage, when the discovery was made, because, as Bass\r\ntwice mentions in his diary, \"we could not land.\" Doubly inaccurate is\r\nthe statement of another writer that \"the promontory was seen and named\r\nby Grant in 1800 after Admiral Wilson.\"* (* Blair, Cyclopaedia of\r\nAustralia, 748.) Grant himself, on his chart of Bass Strait, marked down\r\nthe promontory as \"accurately surveyed by Matthew Flinders, which he\r\ncalls Wilson's Promontory,\" and on page 78 of his Narrative wrote that it\r\nwas named by Bass. The truth is, as related above, that it was named by\r\nHunter on the recommendation of Bass and Flinders; and the two\r\nsuperfluous Wilsons have no proper place in the story. The Thomas Wilson\r\nwhose name was thus given to one of the principal features of the\r\nAustralian coast--a form of memorial far more enduring than \"storied urn\r\nor animated bust\"--is believed to have been a London merchant, engaged\r\npartly in the Australian trade. Nothing more definite is known about him.\r\nHe was as one who \"grew immortal in his own despight.\" Of the Promontory\r\nitself Bass wrote--and the words are exceedingly apt--that it was \"well\r\nworthy of being the boundary point of a large strait, and a corner stone\r\nof this great island New Holland.\"\r\n\r\nBass found the neighbourhood of the Promontory to be the home of vast\r\nnumbers of petrels, gulls and other birds, as is still the case, and he\r\nremarked upon the seals observed upon neighbouring rocks, with \"a\r\nremarkably long tapering neck and sharp pointed head.\" They were the\r\nordinary Bass Strait seal, once exceedingly plentiful, and still to be\r\nfound on some of the islands, but unfortunately much fewer in numbers\r\nnow. The pupping time was passed when Bass sailed through, and many of\r\nthe females had gone to sea, as is their habit. This cause of depletion\r\naccounts for his remark on his return voyage that the number was \"by no\r\nmeans equal to what we had been led to expect.\" But, he added, \"from the\r\nquantity I saw I have every reason to believe that a speculation on a\r\nsmall scale might be carried on with advantage.\"\r\n\r\nFoul winds and heavy breaking seas were experienced while the boat was\r\nnearing the Promontory. To make matters worse, leaks were causing\r\nanxiety. Water was gushing in pretty freely near the water-line aft. The\r\ncrew had frequently remarked in the course of the morning of January 3rd\r\nhow much looser the boat had become during the last few days. Her planks\r\nhad received no ordinary battering. It had been Bass's intention to\r\nstrike for the northern coast of Van Diemen's Land, which he supposed to\r\nbe at no very great distance. He may at this time have been under the\r\nimpression that he was in a deep gulf. As a matter of fact, the nearest\r\npoint southward that he could have reached was 130 miles distant. Anxiety\r\nabout the condition of the boat made him resolve to continue his coasting\r\ncruise westward. Water rushed in fast through the boat's side, there was\r\nrisk of a plank starting, and ploughing through a hollow, irregular sea,\r\nthe explorers were, as Flinders reviewing the adventure wrote, \"in the\r\ngreatest danger.\" Bass's record of his night of peril is\r\ncharacteristically terse: \"we had a bad night of it, but the excellent\r\nqualities of the boat brought us through.\" He says nothing of his own\r\ncareful steering and sleepless vigilance.\r\n\r\nIt was on the evening of the third day, January 3rd, that an incident\r\noccurred to which, curiously enough, Bass made no allusion in his diary,\r\npresumably because it did not concern the actual work of navigation and\r\ndiscovery, but which throws a dash of tragic colour into the story of his\r\nadventure. The boat having returned to the coast of what was supposed to\r\nbe Furneaux Land, was running along \"in whichever way the land might\r\ntrend, for the state of the boat did not seem to allow of our quitting\r\nthe shore with propriety.\" The coast line was being scanned for a place\r\nof shelter, when smoke was observed curling up from an island not far\r\nfrom the Promontory. At first it was thought that the smoke arose from a\r\nfire lighted by aboriginals, but it was discovered, to the amazement of\r\nBass and his crew, that the island was occupied by a party of white men.\r\nThey were escaped convicts. The tale they had to tell was one of a wild\r\ndash for liberty, treachery by confederates, and abandonment to the\r\nimminent danger of starvation.\r\n\r\nIn October of the previous year, a gang of fourteen convicts had been\r\nemployed in carrying stones from Sydney to the Hawkesbury River\r\nsettlement, a few miles to the north. Most of them were \"of the last\r\nIrish convicts,\" as Hunter explained in a despatch, part of the bitter\r\nfruit of the Irish Mutiny Act of 1796, passed to strike at the movement\r\nassociated with the names of Lord Edward Fitzgerald and Wolfe Tone, which\r\nencouraged the attempted French invasion of Ireland under Hoche. These\r\nmen seized the boat appointed for the service, appropriated the stores,\r\nthreatened the lives of all who dared to oppose them, and made their exit\r\nthrough Port Jackson heads. As soon as the Governor heard of the escape\r\nhe despatched parties in pursuit in rowing boats. The coast was searched\r\nsixty miles to the north and forty to the south; but the convicts, with\r\nthe breeze in their sail and the hope of liberty in their hearts, had all\r\nthe advantage on their side, and eluded their gaolers.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1797, news had been brought to the settlement of the wreck of\r\nthe ship Sydney Cove on an island to the southward. If the Irish\r\nprisoners could reach this island, float the ship on the tide, and repair\r\nher rents, they considered that they had an excellent chance of escape.\r\nThe provisions which they had on their boat, with such as they might find\r\non the ship, would probably be sufficient for a voyage. It was a daring\r\nenterprise, but it may well have seemed to offer a prospect of success.\r\n\r\nSome of the prisoners at the settlement, as appears from a \"general\r\norder\" issued by Hunter, had \"picked up somehow or other the idle story\r\nof the possibility of travelling from hence to China, or finding some\r\nother colony where they expect every comfort without the trouble of any\r\nlabour.\" It may have been the alluring hope of discovering such an\r\nearthly paradise that flattered these men. As a matter of fact, some\r\nconvicts did escape from New South Wales and reached India, after\r\nextraordinary perils and hardships. They endeavoured to sail up the River\r\nGodavery, but were interrupted by a party of sepoys, re-arrested, and\r\nsent to Madras, whence they were ordered to be sent back to Sydney.* (*\r\nSee Annual Register 1801 page 15.)\r\n\r\nBut the party whom Bass found never discovered the place of the wreck\r\nupon which they reckoned. Instead, they drifted round Cape Howe, and\r\nfound themselves off a desolate, inhospitable coast, without knowledge of\r\ntheir whereabouts, and with a scanty, rapidly diminishing stock of food.\r\nIn fear of starvation seven of them resolved to desert their companions\r\non this lonely island near Wilson's Promontory, and treacherously sailed\r\naway with the boat while the others were asleep. It was the sad, sick,\r\nand betrayed remnant of this forlorn hope, that Bass found on that\r\nwave-beaten rock on the 3rd January. For five weeks the wretched men had\r\nsubsisted on petrels and occasional seals. Small prospect they had of\r\nbeing saved; the postponement of their doom seemed only a prolongation of\r\ntheir anguish. They were nearly naked, and almost starved to death. Bass\r\nheard their story, pitied their plight, and relieved their necessities as\r\nwell as he could from his own inadequate stores. He also promised that on\r\nhis return he would call again at the island, and do what he could for\r\nthe party, who only escaped from being prisoners of man to become\r\nprisoners of nature, locked in one of her straitest confines, and fed\r\nfrom a reluctant and parsimonious hand.\r\n\r\nBass kept his word; and it may be as well to interrupt the narrative of\r\nhis westward navigation in order to relate the end of this story of\r\ndistress. On February 2nd, he again touched at the island. But what could\r\nhe do to help the fugitives? His boat was too small to enable him to take\r\nthem on board, and his provisions were nearly exhausted, his men having\r\nhad to eke out the store by living on seals and sea birds. He consented\r\nto take on board two of the seven, one of whom was grievously sick and\r\nthe other old and feeble. He provided the five others with a musket and\r\nammunition, fishing lines and hooks, and a pocket compass. He then\r\nconveyed them to the mainland, gave them a supply of food to meet their\r\nimmediate wants, and pointed out that their only hope of salvation was to\r\npursue the coastline round to Port Jackson. The crew of the whaleboat\r\ngave them such articles of clothing as they could spare. Some tears were\r\nshed on both sides when they separated, Bass to continue his homeward\r\nvoyage, the hapless victims of a desperate attempt to escape to face the\r\nlong tramp over five hundred miles of wild and trackless country, with\r\nthe prospect of a prolongation of their term of servitude should they\r\never reach Sydney. \"The difficulties of the country and the possibility\r\nof meeting hostile natives are considerations which will occasion doubts\r\nof their ever being able to reach us,\" wrote Hunter in a despatch\r\nreporting the matter to the Secretary of State. It does not appear that\r\none of the five was even seen again.* (* What some convicts dared and\r\nendured in the effort to escape, is shown in the following very\r\ninteresting paragraph, printed in a London newspaper of May 30th, 1797:\r\n\"The female convict who made her escape from Botany Bay, and suffered the\r\ngreatest hardships during a voyage of three thousand leagues [presumably\r\nshe was a stowaway] and who was afterwards retaken and condemned to\r\ndeath, has been pardoned and released from Newgate. In the story of this\r\nwoman there is something extremely singular. A gentleman of high rank in\r\nthe Army visited her in Newgate, heard the details of her life, and for\r\nthat time departed. The next day he returned, and told the gentleman who\r\nkeeps the prison that he had procured her pardon, at the same time\r\nrequesting that she should not be apprized of the circumstances. The next\r\nday he returned with his carriage, and took off the poor woman, who\r\nalmost expired with gratitude.\")\r\n\r\nTo return to the discovery cruise: on January 5th, at seven in the\r\nevening, Bass's whaleboat turned into Westernport, between the bold\r\ngranite headland of Cape Wollamai, on Phillip Island, and Point Griffith\r\non the mainland. The discovery of this port, now the seat of a naval base\r\nfor the Commonwealth, was a splendid crown to a remarkable voyage. \"I\r\nhave named the place,\" Bass wrote, \"from its relative situation to every\r\nother known harbour on the coast, Western Port. It is a large sheet of\r\nwater, branching out into two arms, which end in wide flats of several\r\nmiles in extent, and it was not until we had been here some days that we\r\nfound it to be formed by an island, and to have two outlets to the sea,\r\nan eastern and western passage.\"\r\n\r\nTwelve days were spent in the harbour. The weather was bad; and to this\r\ncause in the main we may attribute the paucity of the observations made,\r\nand the defective account given of the port itself. It contains two\r\nislands: Phillip Island, facing the strait, and French Island, the larger\r\nof the two, lying between Phillip Island and the mainland. Bass was not\r\naware that this second island was not part of the mainland. Its existence\r\nwas first determined by the Naturaliste, one of the ships of Baudin's\r\nFrench expedition, in 1802.\r\n\r\nBass's men had great difficulty in procuring good water. He considered\r\nthat there was every appearance of an unusual drought in the country.\r\nThis may also have been the reason why he saw only three or four blacks,\r\nwho were so shy that the sailors could not get near them. There must\r\ncertainly have been fairly large families of blacks on Phillip Island at\r\none time, for there are several extensive middens on the coast, with\r\nthick deposits of fish bones and shells; and the author has found there\r\nsome good specimens of \"blackfellows' knives\"--that is, sharpened pieces\r\nof flat, hard stone, with which the aboriginals opened their oysters and\r\nmussels--besides witnessing the finding of a few fine stone axes. Bass\r\nrecords the sight of a few brush kangaroos and \"Wallabah\"; of black swan\r\nhe observed hundreds, as well as ducks, \"a small but excellent kind,\"\r\nwhich flew in thousands, and \"an abundance of most kinds of wild fowl.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time the stay in Westernport came to an end, Bass had been at sea\r\na month and two days, and had sailed well into the strait now bearing his\r\nname, though he was not yet quite sure that it was a strait. His\r\nprovisions had necessarily run very low. The condition of the boat, whose\r\nrepair occupied some time, increased his anxiety. Prudence pointed to the\r\ndesirableness of a return to Port Jackson with the least possible delay.\r\nYet one cannot but regret that so intrepid an explorer, who was making\r\nsuch magnificent use of means so few and frail, was not able to follow\r\nthe coast a very few more miles westward. Another day's sail would have\r\nbrought him into Port Phillip, and he would have been the discoverer of\r\nthe bay at the head of which now stands the great city of Melbourne.\r\nPerhaps if he had done so, his report would have saved Hunter from\r\nwriting a sentence which is a standing warning against premature\r\njudgments upon territory seen at a disadvantage and insufficiently\r\nexamined. \"He found in general,\" wrote the Governor to the Secretary of\r\nState, \"a barren, unpromising country, with very few exceptions, and were\r\nit even better the want of harbours would render it less valuable.\" The\r\ntruth is that he had seen hardly the fringe of some of the fairest lands\r\non earth, and was within cannon shot of a harbour wherein all the navies\r\nof the world could ride.\r\n\r\nShortly after dawn on January 18th the prow of the whaleboat was \"very\r\nreluctantly\" turned ocean-wards for the home journey. The wind was fresh\r\nwhen they started, but as the morning wore on it increased to a gale, and\r\nby noon there were high seas and heavy squalls. As the little craft was\r\nrunning along the coast, and the full force of the south-westerly gale\r\nbeat hard on her beam, her management taxed the nerve and seamanship of\r\nthe crew. Bass acknowledged that it was \"very troublesome,\" and his\r\n\"very\" means much. This extremely trying weather lasted, with a few brief\r\nintervals, for eight days. As soon as possible Bass steered his boat\r\nunder the lee of Cape Liptrap, not only for safety, but also to salt down\r\nfor consumption during the remainder of the voyage a stock of birds taken\r\non the islands off Westernport.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 23rd the boat lay snugly under the shelter of the\r\nrocks, where Bass intended to remain until the weather moderated. But at\r\nabout one o'clock in the morning the wind shifted to the south, blowing\r\n\"stronger than before,\" and made the place untenable. At daybreak,\r\ntherefore, another resting place was sought, and later in the morning the\r\nboat was beached on the west side of a sheltered cove, \"having passed\r\nthrough a sea that for the very few hours it has been blowing was\r\nincredibly high.\" When the wind abated the sea went down, so that Bass\r\nwas able to round the Promontory to the east, enter Sealers' Cove, which\r\nhe named, and lay in a stock of seal-meat and salted birds.\r\n\r\n\"The Promontory,\" wrote Bass, \"is joined to the mainland by a low neck of\r\nsand, which is nearly divided by a lagoon that runs in on the west side\r\nof it, and by a large shoal inlet on the east. Whenever it shall be\r\ndecided that the opening between this and Van Diemen's Land is a large\r\nstrait, this rapidity of tide and the long south-west swell that seems\r\ncontinually running in upon the coast to the westward, will then be\r\naccounted for.\" It is evident, therefore, that at this time Bass regarded\r\nthe certainty of there being a strait as a matter yet to \"be decided.\" He\r\nwas himself thereafter to assist in the decision.\r\n\r\nThough Bass does not give any particulars of aboriginals encountered at\r\nWilson's Promontory, it is apparent from an allusion in his diary that\r\nsome were seen. The sentence in which he mentions them is curious for its\r\nclassification of them with the other animals observed, a classification\r\nbiologically justifiable, no doubt, but hardly usual. \"The animals,\" he\r\nwrote, \"have nothing new in them worth mentioning, with these exceptions;\r\nthat the men, though thieves, are kind and friendly, and that the birds\r\nupon Furneaux's Land have a sweetness of note unknown here,\" i.e., at\r\nPort Jackson. He would not, in February, have heard the song-lark, that\r\nunshamed rival of an English cousin famed in poetry, and the sharp\r\ncrescendo of the coach-whip bird would scarcely be classed as \"sweet.\"\r\n\"The tinkle of the bell-bird in the ranges may have gratified his ear;\r\nbut the likelihood is that the birds which pleased him were the\r\nharmonious thrush and the mellow songster so opprobiously named the\r\nthickhead, for no better reason than that collectors experience a\r\ndifficulty in skinning it.* (* Mr. Chas. L. Barrett, a well known\r\nAustralian ornithologist, and one of the editors of the Emu, knows the\r\nPromontory well, and he tells me that he has no doubt that the birds\r\nwhich pleased Bass were the grey shrike thrush (Collyriocincla harmonica)\r\nand the white-throated thickhead (Pachycephala gutturalis.))\r\n\r\nThe cruise from the Promontory eastward was commenced on February 2nd.\r\nEight days later, the boat being in no condition for keeping the sea with\r\na foul wind, Bass beached her not far from Ram Head. He had passed Point\r\nHicks in the night. Cape Howe was rounded on the 15th, and on the 25th\r\nthe boat entered Port Jackson.\r\n\r\nBass and his men had accomplished a great achievement. In an open boat,\r\nexposed to the full rigours of the weather in seas that are frequently\r\nrough and were on this voyage especially storm-lashed, persecuted\r\npersistently by contrary gales, they had travelled twelve hundred miles,\r\nprincipally along an unknown coast, which they had for the first time\r\nexplored. Hunter in his official despatch commented on Bass's\r\n\"perseverance against adverse winds and almost incessant bad weather,\"\r\nand complimented him upon his sedulous examination of inlets in search of\r\nsecure harbours. But there can be no better summary of the voyage than\r\nthat penned by Flinders, who from his own experience could adequately\r\nappreciate the value of the performance. Writing fifteen years later,\r\nwhen Bass had disappeared and was believed to be dead, his friend said:--\r\n\r\n\"It should be remembered that Mr. Bass sailed with only six weeks'\r\nprovisions; but with the assistance of occasional supplies of petrels,\r\nfish, seals'-flesh, and a few geese and black swans, and by abstinence,\r\nhe had been enabled to prolong his voyage beyond eleven weeks. His ardour\r\nand perseverance were crowned, in despite of the foul winds which so much\r\nopposed him, with a degree of success not to have been anticipated from\r\nsuch feeble means. In three hundred miles of coast from Port Jackson to\r\nthe Ram Head, he added a number of particulars which had escaped Captain\r\nCook, and will always escape any navigator in a first discovery, unless\r\nhe have the time and means of joining a close examination by boats to\r\nwhat may be seen from the ship.\r\n\r\n\"Our previous knowledge of the coast scarcely extended beyond the Ram\r\nHead; and there began the harvest in which Mr. Bass was ambitious to\r\nplace the first reaping-hook. The new coast was traced three hundred\r\nmiles; and instead of trending southward to join itself to Van Diemen's\r\nLand, as Captain Furneaux had supposed, he found it, beyond a certain\r\npoint, to take a direction nearly opposite, and to assume the appearance\r\nof being exposed to the buffeting of an open sea. Mr. Bass himself\r\nentertained no doubt of the existence of a wide strait separating Van\r\nDiemen's Land from New South Wales, and he yielded with the greatest\r\nreluctance to the necessity of returning before it was so fully\r\nascertained as to admit of no doubt in the minds of others. But he had\r\nthe satisfaction of placing at the end of his new coast an extensive and\r\nuseful harbour, surrounded with a country superior to any other harbour\r\nin the southern parts of New South Wales.\r\n\r\n\"A voyage especially undertaken for discovery in an open boat, and in\r\nwhich six hundred miles of coast, mostly in a boisterous climate, was\r\nexplored, has not, perhaps, its equal in the annals of maritime history.\r\nThe public will award to its high-spirited and able conductor--alas! now\r\nno more--an honourable place in the list of those whose ardour stands\r\nmost conspicuous for the promotion of useful knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nBass would have desired no better recognition than this competent\r\nappraisement of his work by one who, when he wrote these paragraphs, had\r\nhimself experienced a full measure of the perils of the sea.\r\n\r\nWas Bass at the time of his return aware that he had discovered a strait?\r\nIt has been asserted that \"it is evident that Bass was not fully\r\nconscious of the great discovery he had made.\"* (* F.M. Bladen,\r\nHistorical Records of New South Wales 3 327 note.) Bass's language, upon\r\nwhich this surmise is founded, was as follows: \"Whenever it shall be\r\ndecided that the opening between this and Van Diemen's Land is a strait,\r\nthis rapidity of tide...will be accounted for.\" He also wrote: \"There is\r\nreason to believe it (i.e., Wilson's Promontory) is the boundary of a\r\nlarge strait.\" I do not think these passages are to be taken to mean that\r\nBass was at all doubtful about there being a strait. On the contrary, the\r\nwords \"whenever it shall be decided\" express his conviction that it would\r\nbe so decided; but the diarist recognised that the existence of the\r\nstrait had not yet been proved to demonstration. His reluctance to turn\r\nback when he reached Westernport was unquestionably due to the same\r\ncause. The voyage in the whaleboat had not proved the strait. It was\r\nstill possible, though not at all probable, that the head of a deep gulf\r\nlay farther westward. The subsequent circumnavigation of Tasmania by Bass\r\nand Flinders proved the strait, as did also Grant's voyage through it\r\nfrom the west in the Lady Nelson in 1800.\r\n\r\nHunter had no more evidence than that afforded by Bass's discoveries when\r\nhe wrote, in his despatch to the Secretary of State: \"He found an open\r\nocean westward, and by the mountainous sea which rolled from that\r\nquarter, and no land discoverable in that direction, we have much reason\r\nto conclude that there is an open strait through.\" Hunter's \"much reason\r\nto conclude\" implies no more doubt about the strait than do the words of\r\nBass, but the phrase does imply a recognition of the want of conclusive\r\nproof, creditable to the restrained judgment of both men. Flinders also\r\nwrote: \"There seemed to want no other proof of the existence of a passage\r\nthan that of sailing positively through it,\" which is precisely what he\r\nset himself to do in Bass's company, as soon as he could secure an\r\nopportunity. Still stronger testimony is that of Flinders, when summing\r\nup his account of the discovery: \"The south-westerly swell which rolled\r\nin upon the shores of Westernport and its neighbourhood sufficiently\r\nindicated to the penetrating Bass that he was exposed to the southern\r\nIndian Ocean. This opinion, which he constantly asserted, was the\r\nprincipal cause of my services being offered to the Governor to ascertain\r\nthe principal cause of it.\" Further, although Colonel David Collins was\r\nnot in Sydney at the time of the discovery, what he wrote in his account\r\nof the English Colony in New South Wales (2nd edition, London, 1804), was\r\nbased on first-hand information; and he was no less direct in his\r\nstatement: \"There was every appearance of an extensive strait, or rather\r\nan open sea\"; and he adds that Bass \"regretted that he had not been\r\npossessed of a better vessel, which would have enabled him to\r\ncircumnavigate Van Diemen's Land\" (pages 443 and 444).\r\n\r\nThese passages, when compared with Bass's own careful language, leave no\r\ndoubt that Bass was fully conscious of the great discovery he had made,\r\nthough a complete demonstration was as yet lacking.* (* The reasons given\r\nabove appear also to justify me in saying that there is insufficient\r\nwarrant for the statement of Sir J.K. Laughton (Dictionary of National\r\nBiography XLX 326) that \"Bass's observations were so imperfect that it\r\nwas not until they were plotted after his return that the importance of\r\nwhat he had done was at once apparent.\")\r\n\r\nAn interesting light is thrown on the admiration felt for Bass among the\r\ncolonists at Sydney, by Francois Peron, the historian of Baudin's voyage\r\nof exploration. When the French were at Port Jackson in 1802, the\r\nwhaleboat was lying beached on the foreshore, and was preserved, says\r\nPeron, with a kind of \"religious respect.\" Small souvenirs were made of\r\nits timbers; and a piece of the keel enclosed in a silver frame, was\r\npresented by the Governor to Captain Baudin, as a memorial of the\r\n\"audacieuse navigation.\" Baudin's artist, in making a drawing of Sydney,\r\nwas careful to show Bass's boat stayed up on the sand; and Peron, in his\r\nVoyage de Decouvertes aux Terres Australes, respectfully described the\r\ndiscovery of \"the celebrated Mr. Bass\" as \"precious from a marine point\r\nof view.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. THE VOYAGE OF THE FRANCIS.\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of Bass in the whaleboat, the repairing of the\r\nReliance was finished, and in February, 1798, Flinders was able to carry\r\nout a bit of exploration on his own account. The making of charts was\r\nemployment for which he had equipped himself by study and practice, and\r\nhe was glad to secure an opportunity of applying his abilities in a field\r\nwhere there was original work to do. The schooner Francis (a small vessel\r\nsent out in frame from England for the use of the colonial government,\r\nbut now badly decayed) was about to be despatched to the Furneaux\r\nIslands--north-east of Van Diemen's Land, and about 480 miles from\r\nSydney--to bring to Sydney what remained of the cargo of the wrecked\r\nSydney Cove, and to rescue a few of the crew who had been left in charge.\r\nFlinders obtained permission from the Governor to embark in the schooner,\r\n\"in order to make such observations serviceable to geography and\r\nnavigation as circumstances might afford,\" and instructions were given to\r\nthe officer in command to forward this purpose as far as possible.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the wreck that occasioned the cruise of the Francis\r\nwere these:--\r\n\r\nThe Sydney Cove, Captain Guy Hamilton, left Bengal on November 10th,\r\n1796, with a speculative cargo of merchandise for Sydney. Serious\r\nleakages became apparent on the voyage, but the ship made the coast of\r\nNew Holland, rounded the southern extremity of Van Diemen's Land, and\r\nstood to the northward on February 1st, 1797. She encountered furious\r\ngales which increased to a perfect hurricane, with a sea described in a\r\ncontemporary account as \"dreadful.\" The condition of the hull was so bad\r\nthat the pumps could not keep the inrush of water under control, and the\r\nvessel became waterlogged. On February 8th she had five feet of water in\r\nthe well, and by midnight the water was up to the lower deck hatches. She\r\nwas at daybreak in imminent peril of going to the bottom, so the Captain\r\nheaded for Preservation Island (one of the Furneaux Group), sent the\r\nlongboat ashore with some rice, ammunition and firearms, and ran her in\r\nuntil she struck on a sandy bottom in nineteen feet of water. The whole\r\nship's company was landed safely, tents were rigged up, and as much of\r\nthe cargo as could be secured was taken ashore.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to communicate with Sydney to procure assistance. The\r\nlong-boat was launched, and under the direction of the first mate, Mr.\r\nHugh Thompson, sixteen of the crew started north on February 28th. But\r\nfresh misfortunes, as cruel as shipwreck and for most of these men more\r\ndisastrous, were heaped upon them. They were smitten by a violent storm,\r\nterrific seas broke over the boat, and on the morning of March 2nd she\r\nsuddenly shipped enough water to swamp her. The crew with difficulty ran\r\nher through the surf that beat on the coast off which they had been\r\nstruggling, and she went to pieces immediately. The seventeen were cast\r\nashore on the coast of New South Wales, hundreds of miles from the only\r\nsettlement, which could only be reached by the crossing of a wild, rough,\r\nand trackless country, inhabited by tribes of savages. They were without\r\nfood, their clothing was drenched, and their sole means of defence\r\nconsisted of a rusty musket, with very little ammunition, a couple of\r\nuseless pistols, and two small swords.\r\n\r\nThe wretched band commenced their march along the coast northwards on\r\nMarch 25th. They had to improvise rafts to cross some rivers; once a\r\nparty of kindly aboriginals helped them over a stream in canoes; at\r\nanother time they encountered blacks who hurled spears at them. They\r\nlived chiefly on small shell-fish. Hunger and exposure brought their\r\nstrength very low. On April 16th, after over a month of weary tramping,\r\nnine of the party dropped from fatigue and had to be left behind by their\r\ncompanions, whose only hope was to push on while sufficient energy\r\nlasted. Two days later, three of the remainder were wounded by blacks. At\r\nlast, in May, three only of the seventeen who started on this\r\nheart-breaking struggle for life against distance, starvation and\r\nexhaustion, were rescued, \"scarcely alive,\" by a fishing boat, and taken\r\nto Sydney. The others perished by the way.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hamilton, who had stayed by his wrecked ship, was rescued in\r\nJuly, 1797; and, as already stated, in January of the following year,\r\nGovernor Hunter fitted out the schooner Francis to bring away a few\r\nLascar sailors and as much of the remaining cargo as could be saved. \"I\r\nsent in the schooner,\" wrote the Governor in a despatch, \"Lieutenant\r\nFlinders of the Reliance, a young man well-qualified, in order to give\r\nhim an opportunity of making what observations he could among those\r\nislands.\" The Francis sailed on February 1st.\r\n\r\nThe black shadow of the catastrophe that had overtaken the Sydney Cove\r\ncrossed the path of the salvage party. The Francis was accompanied by the\r\nten-ton sloop Eliza, Captain Armstrong. But shortly after reaching the\r\nFurneaux Islands the two vessels were separated in a storm, and the Eliza\r\nwent down with all hands. Neither the boat nor any soul of her company\r\nwere ever seen or heard of again.\r\n\r\nFlinders had only twelve days available for his own work, from February\r\n16th till the 28th, but he made full and valuable use of that time in\r\nexploring, observing and charting. The fruits of his researches were\r\nembodied in a drawing sent to the British Government by Hunter, when he\r\nannounced the discovery of Bass Strait later on in 1798. The principal\r\ngeographical result was the discovery of the Kent group of islands, which\r\nFlinders named \"in honour of my friend\" the brave and accomplished\r\nsailor, William Kent, who commanded the Supply.\r\n\r\nThe biological notes made by Flinders on this expedition are of unusual\r\ninterest. Upon the islands he found \"Kanguroo\" (his invariable spelling\r\nof the word), \"womat\" (sic), the duck-billed platypus, aculeated\r\nant-eater, geese, black swan, gannets, shags, gulls, red bills, crows,\r\nparrakeets, snakes, seals, and sooty petrels, a profusion of wild life\r\nhighly fascinating in itself, and, in the case of the animals, affording\r\nstriking evidence of connection with the mainland at a comparatively\r\nrecent period. The old male seals were described as of enormous size and\r\nextraordinary power.\r\n\r\n\"I levelled my gun at one, which was sitting on the top of a rock with\r\nhis nose extended up towards the sun, and struck him with three musket\r\nballs. He rolled over and plunged into the water, but in less than half\r\nan hour had taken his former station and attitude. On firing again, a\r\nstream of blood spouted forth from his breast to some yards distance, and\r\nhe fell back senseless. On examination the six balls were found lodged in\r\nhis breast; and one, which occasioned his death, had pierced the heart.\r\nHis weight was equal to that of a common ox...The commotion excited by\r\nour presence in this assemblage of several thousand timid animals was\r\nvery interesting to me, who knew little of their manners. The young cubs\r\nhuddled together in the holes of the rocks and moaned piteously; those\r\nmore advanced scampered and bowled down to the water with their mothers;\r\nwhilst some of the old males stood up in defence of their families until\r\nthe terror of the sailors' bludgeons became too strong to be resisted.\r\nThose who have seen a farmyard well stocked with pigs, with their mothers\r\nin it, and have heard them all in tumult together, may form a good idea\r\nof the confusion in connection with the seals at Cone Point. The sailors\r\nkilled as many of these harmless and not unamiable creatures as they were\r\nable to skin during the time necessary for me to take the requisite\r\nangles; and we then left the poor affrighted multitude to recover from\r\nthe effect of our inauspicious visit.\"\r\n\r\nFlinders' observations upon the sooty petrels, or mutton birds, seen at\r\nthe Furneaux Islands, are valuable as forming a very early account of one\r\nof the most remarkable sea-birds in the world:\r\n\r\n\"The sooty petrel, better known to us under the name of sheerwater,\r\nfrequents the tufted grassy parts of all the islands in astonishing\r\nnumbers. It is known that these birds make burrows in the ground like\r\nrabbits; that they lay one or two enormous eggs in the holes and bring up\r\ntheir young there. In the evening they come in from the sea, having their\r\nstomachs filled with a gelatinous substance gathered from the waves, and\r\nthis they eject into the throats of their offspring, or retain for their\r\nown nourishment, according to circumstances. A little after sunset the\r\nair at Preservation Island used to be darkened with their numbers, and it\r\nwas generally an hour before their squabbling ceased and every one had\r\nfound its own retreat. The people of the Sydney Cove had a strong example\r\nof perseverance in these birds. The tents were pitched close to a piece\r\nof ground full of their burrows, many of which were necessarily filled up\r\nfrom walking constantly over them; yet notwithstanding this interruption\r\nand the thousands of birds destroyed (for they constituted a great part\r\nof their food during more than six months), the returning flights\r\ncontinued to be as numerous as before; and there was scarcely a burrow\r\nless except in the places actually covered by the tents. These birds are\r\nabout the size of a pigeon, and when skinned and smoked we thought them\r\npassable food. Any quantity could be procured by sending people on shore\r\nin the evening. The sole process was to thrust in the arm up to the\r\nshoulder and seize them briskly; but there was some danger of grasping a\r\nsnake at the bottom of the burrow instead of a petrel.\"\r\n\r\nThe remark that the egg of the sooty petrel is of enormous size is of\r\ncourse only true relatively to the size of the bird. The egg is about as\r\nlarge as a duck's egg, but longer and tapering more sharply at one end.\r\nFor the rest the description is an excellent one. The wings of the bird\r\nare of great length and strength, giving to it wonderful speed and power\r\nof flight. The colour is coal-black. Flinders saw more of the\r\nsooty-petrel on his subsequent voyage round Tasmania; and it will be\r\nconvenient to quote here the passage in which he refers to the prodigious\r\nnumbers in which the birds were seen. It may be added that, despite a\r\ncentury of slaughter by mankind, and after the taking of millions of\r\neggs--which are good food--the numbers of the mutton-birds are still\r\nincalculably great.* (* The author may refer to a paper of his own, \"The\r\nMutton Birds of Bass Strait,\" in the Field, April 18, 1903, for a study\r\nof the sooty petrel during the laying season on Phillip Island. An\r\nexcellent account of the habits of the bird is given in Campbell's Nests\r\nand Eggs of Australian Birds.) Writing of what he saw off the extreme\r\nnorth-west of Tasmania in December, 1798, Flinders said:--\r\n\r\n\"A large flock of gannets was observed at daylight to issue out of the\r\ngreat bight to the southward; and they were followed by such a number of\r\nsooty petrels as we had never seen equalled. There was a stream of from\r\nfifty to eighty yards in depth and of three hundred yards, or more, in\r\nbreadth; the birds were not scattered, but flying as compactly as a free\r\nmovement of their wings seemed to allow; and during a full hour and a\r\nhalf this stream of petrels continued to pass without interruption at a\r\nrate little inferior to the swiftness of a pigeon. On the lowest\r\ncomputation I think the number could not have been less than a hundred\r\nmillions.\"\r\n\r\nHe explained how he arrived at this estimate, the reliableness of which\r\nis beyond dispute, though it may seem incredible to those who have not\r\nbeen in southern seas during the season when the sooty petrels \"most do\r\ncongregate.\" Taking the stream of birds to have been fifty yards deep by\r\nthree hundred in width, and calculating that it moved at the rate of\r\nthirty miles* an hour, and allowing nine cubic yards for each bird, the\r\nnumber would amount to 151,500,000. The burrows required to lodge this\r\nnumber would be 75,750,000, and allowing a square yard to each burrow\r\nthey would cover something more than 18 1/2 geographical square miles. (*\r\nFlinders is calculating in nautical miles of 2026 2/3 yards each.)\r\n\r\nThe mutton-bird, it will therefore be allowed, is the most prolific of\r\nall avian colonists. It has also played some part in the history of human\r\ncolonisation. When, in 1790, Governor Phillip sent to Norfolk Island a\r\ncompany of convicts and marines, and the Sirius, the only means of\r\ncarrying supplies, was wrecked, the population, 506 in all, was reduced\r\nto dire distress from want of food. Starvation stared them in the face,\r\nwhen it was discovered that Mount Pitt was honeycombed with mutton-bird\r\nburrows. They were slain in thousands. \"The slaughter and mighty havoc is\r\nbeyond description,\" wrote an officer. \"They are very fine eating,\r\nexceeding fat and firm, and I think (though no connoisseur) as good as\r\nany I ever eat.\" Many people who are not hunger-driven profess to relish\r\nyoung mutton-bird, whose flesh is like neither fish nor fowl, but an oily\r\nblend of both.\r\n\r\nOn this cruise Flinders came in sight of Cook's Point Hicks; and his\r\nreference to it has some interest because Bass had missed it; because\r\nFlinders himself did not on any of his other voyages sail close enough\r\ninshore on this part of the coast to observe it, and did not mark it upon\r\nhis charts; and because the more recent substitution of the name Cape\r\nEverard for the name given by Cook, makes of some consequence the\r\nallusion of this great navigator to a projection which he saw only once.\r\nThe Francis on February 4th \"was in 38 degrees 16 minutes and (by\r\naccount) 22 minutes of longitude to the west of Point Hicks. The schooner\r\nwas kept more northward in the afternoon; at four o'clock a moderately\r\nhigh sloping hill was visible in the north by west, and at seven a small\r\nrocky point on the beach bore north 50 degrees west three or four\r\nleagues. At some distance inland there was a range of hills with wood\r\nupon them, though scarcely sufficient to hide their sandy surface.\" That\r\ndescribes the country near Point Hicks accurately.\r\n\r\nThe largest island in the Furneaux group, now called Flinders Island, was\r\nnot so named by Flinders. He referred to it as \"the great island of\r\nFurneaux.\" Flinders never named any of his discoveries after himself, not\r\neven the smallest rock or cape. Flinders Island in the Bight\r\n(Investigator Group) was named after his brother Samuel.\r\n\r\nIt is a little curious that no allusion to the useful piece of work done\r\nby Flinders on this cruise was made by the Governor in his despatches.\r\nThe omission was not due to lack of appreciation on his part, as the\r\nencouragement subsequently given to Bass and Flinders sufficiently\r\nshowed. But it was, in truth, work very well done, with restricted means\r\nand in a very limited time.\r\n\r\nThe question whether the islands examined lay in a strait or in a deep\r\ngulf was occupying the attention of Flinders at just about the same time\r\nwhen his friend Bass, in his whaleboat on the north side of the same\r\nstretch of water, was revolving the same problem in his mind. The reasons\r\ngiven by Furneaux for disbelieving in the existence of a strait did not\r\nsatisfy Flinders. The great strength of the tides setting westward could,\r\nin his opinion, only be occasioned by a passage through to the Indian\r\nOcean, unless the supposed gulf were very deep. There were arguments\r\ntending either way; \"the contradictory circumstances were very\r\nembarrassing.\" Flinders would have liked to use the Francis forthwith to\r\nsettle the question; but, as she was commissioned for a particular\r\nservice, and not under his command, he had to subjugate his scientific\r\ncuriosity to circumstances.\r\n\r\nThroughout his brief narrative of this voyage we see displayed the\r\nqualities which distinguish all his original work. Promptness in taking\r\nadvantage of opportunities for investigation, careful and\r\ncautiously-checked observations, painstaking accuracy in making\r\ncalculations, terse and dependable geographical description, and a fresh\r\nquick eye for noting natural phenomena: these were always characteristics\r\nof his work. He recorded what he saw of bird and animal with the same\r\ncare as he noted nautical facts. We may take his paragraph on the wombat\r\nas an example. Bass was much interested in the wombats he saw, and with\r\nhis surgeon's anatomical knowledge gave a description of it which the\r\ncontemporary historian, Collins, quoted, enunciating the opinion that\r\n\"Bass's womb-bat seemed to be very oeconomically made\"--whatever that may\r\nmean. Flinders' description, which must be one of the earliest accounts\r\nof the creature, is true:\r\n\r\n\"Clarke's Island afforded the first specimen of the new animal, called\r\nwombat. This little bear-like quadruped is known in New South Wales, and\r\nis called by the natives womat, wombat, or womback, according to the\r\ndifferent dialects--or perhaps to the different rendering of the\r\nwood-rangers who brought the information. It does not quit its retreat\r\ntill dark; but it feeds at all times on the uninhabited islands, and was\r\ncommonly seen foraging amongst the sea refuse on the shore, though the\r\ncoarse grass seemed to be its usual nourishment. It is easily caught when\r\nat a distance from its burrow; its flesh resembles lean mutton in taste,\r\nand to us was acceptable food.\"\r\n\r\nThe original manuscript containing Flinders' narrative of the expedition\r\nto the Furneaux Islands is in the Melbourne Public Library. It is a\r\nbeautiful manuscript, 22 quarto pages, neat and regular, every letter\r\nperfect, every comma and semi-colon in place: a portrait in calligraphy\r\nof its author.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. CIRCUMNAVIGATION OF TASMANIA.\r\n\r\nFlinders arrived in Sydney in the Francis about a fortnight after Bass\r\nreturned in the whaleboat. It was, we may be certain, with delight that\r\nhe heard from the lips of his friend the story of his adventurous voyage.\r\nThe eye-sketch of the coastline traversed by Bass was, by the Governor's\r\ndirection, used by him for the preparation of a chart to be sent to\r\nEngland. He was able to compare notes and discuss the probability of the\r\nexistence of a strait, and it was but natural that the two men who had so\r\nrecently been exploring, the one on the north the other on the south side\r\nof the possible strait, should be eager to pursue enquiry to the point of\r\nproof. Flinders acknowledged, in relating these events, his anxiety to\r\ngratify his desire of positively sailing through the strait and round Van\r\nDiemen's Land, and he chafed under the routine duties which postponed the\r\neffort. The opportunity did not occur till September.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Flinders had to sail in the Reliance to Norfolk Island\r\nto take over the surgeon, D'Arcy Wentworth, father of that William\r\nWentworth whose name has already figured in these pages, and who was then\r\na boy of seven. This trip took place in May to July.\r\n\r\nIn August he sat as a member of the Vice-Admiralty Court of New South\r\nWales to try a case of mutiny on the high seas. Certain members of the\r\nNew South Wales Corps were accused of plotting to seize the convict ship\r\nBarwell, on her voyage between the Cape and Australia, and of drinking\r\nthe toast \"damnation to the King and country.\" The Court considered the\r\nevidence insufficient, and the men were acquitted, after a trial lasting\r\nsix days.\r\n\r\nAt last Flinders had an interview with the Governor about completing the\r\nexploration of the seas to the southward, and offered his services.\r\nHunter, too, was anxious to have a test made of Bass's contention, which\r\nFlinders' own observations supported. On September 3rd he wrote to the\r\nSecretary of State that he was endeavouring to fit out a vessel \"in which\r\nI propose to send the two officers I have mentioned,\" Bass and Flinders.\r\nLater in the month the Governor entrusted the latter with the command of\r\nthe Norfolk, a sloop of twenty-five tons burthen, built at Norfolk Island\r\nfrom local pine. She was merely a small decked boat, put together under\r\nthe direction of Captain Townson of Norfolk Island for establishing\r\ncommunication with Sydney. She leaked; her timbers were poor material for\r\na seaboat in quarters where heavy weather was to be expected; and the\r\naccommodation she offered for a fairly extended cruise was cramped and\r\nuncomfortable. But she was the best craft the Governor had to offer, and\r\nFlinders was too keen for the quest to quarrel with the means. In those\r\ndays fine seamanship and endurance often had to make up for deficiencies\r\nin equipment.\r\n\r\nThere were not two happier men in the King's service than these fast\r\nfriends, when they received the Governor's commission directing them to\r\nsail \"beyond Furneaux' Islands, and, should a strait be found, to pass\r\nthrough it, and return by the south end of Van Diemen's Land.\" The\r\naffection that existed between them is manifest in every reference which\r\nFlinders made to Bass in his book, A Voyage to Terra Australis. \"I had\r\nthe happiness to associate my friend Bass in this new expedition,\" he\r\nwrote of the Norfolk's voyage; and it was a happiness based not only on\r\npersonal regard, but on kindred feeling for research work, and a\r\nsimilarity in active, keen and ardent temperament.\r\n\r\nThe sloop was provisioned for twelve weeks, and \"the rest of the\r\nequipment was completed by the friendly care of Captain Waterhouse of the\r\nReliance.\" A crew of eight volunteers was chosen by Flinders from the\r\nKing's ships in port. It is likely that some of them were amongst the six\r\nwho had accompanied Bass to Westernport, and Flinders to the Furneaux and\r\nKent Islands, but their names have not been preserved.\r\n\r\nThe Norfolk sailed on October 7, 1798, in company with a sealing boat,\r\nthe Nautilus.* (* There are three accounts of the voyage: (1) that of\r\nFlinders in diary form, printed in the Historical Records of New South\r\nWales Volume 3 appendix B; (2) that of Flinders in his Voyage to Terra\r\nAustralis Volume 1 page 138; and (3) that of Bass, embodied in Collins'\r\nAccount of New South Wales. It is probable that Bass's diary was lent to\r\nCollins for the purpose of writing his narrative. The original is not\r\nknown to exist.) The plan was to make the Furneaux Group, then steer\r\nwestward through the strait till the open ocean was reached on the\r\nfurther side; and, that accomplished, and the fact of strait's existence\r\nconclusively demonstrated, to turn down the western coast of Van Diemen's\r\nLand, round the southern extremity, and sail back to Port Jackson up the\r\neast coast. This programme was successfully carried out.\r\n\r\nAn amusing incident, related by Flinders with dry humour, occurred in\r\nTwofold Bay, which was entered \"in order to make some profit of a foul\r\nwind,\" Bass undertaking an inland excursion, and Flinders occupying\r\nhimself in making a survey of the port. An aboriginal made his\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n\"He was of middle age, unarmed, except with a whaddie or wooden scimitar,\r\nand came up to us seemingly with careless confidence. We made much of\r\nhim, and gave him some biscuit; and he in return presented us with a\r\npiece of gristly fat, probably of whale. This I tasted; but, watching an\r\nopportunity to spit it out when he should not be looking, I perceived him\r\ndoing precisely the same thing with our biscuit, whose taste was probably\r\nno more agreeable to him, than his whale was to me.\" The native watched\r\nthe commencement of Flinders' trigonometrical operations, \"with\r\nindifference, if not contempt,\" and after a little while left the party,\r\n\"apparently satisfied that from people who could thus occupy themselves\r\nseriously there was nothing to be apprehended.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not until November 1st that the Norfolk sailed from the Furneaux\r\nIslands on the flood-tide westward. The intervening time had been\r\noccupied with detailed exploring and surveying work. Soundings and\r\nobservations were made, capes, islands and inlets were charted and named.\r\nThe part of Flinders' narrative dealing with these phases abounds in\r\ndetail, noted with the most painstaking particularity. Such fulness does\r\nnot make attractive literature for the reader who takes up a book of\r\ntravel for amusement. But it was highly important to record these details\r\nat the time of the publication of Flinders' book, when the coasts and\r\nseas of which he wrote were very little known; and it has to be\r\nremembered that he wrote as a scientific navigator, setting down the\r\nresults of his work with completeness and precision for those interested\r\nin his subject, not as a caterer for popular literary entertainment. He\r\npreferred the interest in his writing to lie in the nature of the\r\nenterprise described and the sincerity with which it was pursued rather\r\nthan in such anecdotal garniture and such play of fancy as can give charm\r\nto the history of a voyage. His book was a substantial contribution to\r\nthe world's knowledge, and it is his especial virtue to have set down his\r\nfacts with such exactitude that our tests of them, where they are still\r\ncapable of being tested, earn him credit for punctilious veracity in\r\nrespect of those observations on wild life and natural phenomena as to\r\nwhich we have to rely upon his written word. He never succumbs to the\r\ncommon sin of travellers--writing to excite astonishment in the reader,\r\nrather than to tell the exact truth as he found it. He was by nature and\r\ntraining an exact man.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of November 3rd the sloop entered the estuary of the\r\nriver Tamar, on which, forty miles from the mouth, now stands the fine\r\ncity of Launceston. It was a discovery of first-class importance. Apart\r\nfrom the pleasure which they derived from having made it, the two friends\r\nwere charmed with the beauty of their surroundings. They derived the most\r\nfavourable impression of the quality of the land and its suitableness for\r\nsettlement. They worked up the river for several miles, but time did not\r\npermit them to follow it as far as it was navigable. Thus they did not\r\nreach the site of the present city, and left the superb gorge and\r\ncataract to be discovered by Collins when he entered the Tamar again in\r\n1804. The harbour was subsequently named Port Dalrymple by Hunter, after\r\nAlexander Dalrymple, the naval hydrographer.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the survey, with delays caused by adverse weather, kept the\r\nNorfolk in the Tamar estuary for a full month. On December 3rd her\r\nwestward course was resumed. From this time forth Bass and Flinders were\r\nin constant expectancy of passing through the strait into the open ocean.\r\nThe northern trend of the coast for a time aroused apprehensions that\r\nthere was no strait after all, and that the northern shore of Van\r\nDiemen's Land might be connected with the coast beyond Westernport. The\r\nwater was also discoloured, and this led Flinders to think that they\r\nmight be approaching the head of a bay or gulf. But on December 7th the\r\nvigilant commander made an observation of the set of the tide, from which\r\nhe drew an \"interesting deduction.\" \"The tide had been running from the\r\neastward all the afternoon,\" wrote Flinders, \"and, contrary to\r\nexpectation, we found it to be near low water by the shore; the flood\r\ntherefore came from the west, and not from the eastward, as at Furneaux'\r\nIsles. This we considered to be a strong proof, not only of the real\r\nexistence of a passage betwixt this land and New South Wales, but also\r\nthat the entrance into the southern Indian Ocean could not be far\r\ndistant.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following day the deduction was confirmed. After the Norfolk had\r\nrounded a headland, a long swell was observed to come from the\r\nsouth-west, breaking heavily upon a reef a mile and a half away. This was\r\na new phenomenon; and both Bass and Flinders \"hailed it with joy and\r\nmutual congratulation, as announcing the completion of our\r\nlong-wished-for discovery of a passage into the southern Indian Ocean.\"\r\nThey were now through the strait. What Bass months before had believed to\r\nbe the case was at length demonstrated to a certainty. \"The direction of\r\nthe coast, the set of the tides, and the great swell from the south-west,\r\ndid now completely satisfy us that a very wide strait did really exist\r\nbetwixt Van Diemen's Land and New South Wales, and also now that we had\r\ncertainly passed it.\"\r\n\r\nNo time was lost in completing the voyage. The Norfolk sped rapidly past\r\nCape Grim and down the western coast of Van Diemen's Land. Amateur-built\r\nas she was, and very small for her work in these seas, she was proving a\r\nuseful boat, and one can enjoy the sailors' pride in a snug craft in\r\nFlinders' remark concerning her, that \"upon the whole she performed\r\nwonderfully; seas that were apparently determined to swallow her up she\r\nrode over with all the ease and majesty of an old experienced petrel.\"\r\n\r\nThe wild and desolate aspect of the west coast, as seen from the ocean,\r\nseems to have struck Flinders with a feeling of dread. He so rarely\r\nallows any emotion to appear in his writing that the sentences in his\r\ndiary wherein he refers to the appearance of the De Witt range are\r\nstriking evidence of his revulsion. \"The mountains which presented\r\nthemselves to our view in this situation, both close to the shore and\r\ninland, were amongst the most stupendous works of nature I ever beheld,\r\nand it seemed to me are the most dismal and barren that can be imagined.\r\nThe eye ranges over these peaks, and curiously formed lumps of adamantine\r\nrock, with astonishment and horror.\" He acknowledged that he clapped on\r\nall sail to get past this forbidding coast. The passage is singular.\r\nFlinders was a fenland-bred man, and, passing from the low levels of\r\neastern England to a life at sea in early youth, had had no experience of\r\nmountainous country. He had not even seen the mountains at the back of\r\nSydney, except in the blue distance. Now, the De Witt range, though\r\ncertainly giving to the coast that it dominates an aspect of desolate\r\ngrandeur, especially when, as is nearly always the case, its jagged peaks\r\nare seen under caps of frowning cloud, would not strike a man who had\r\nbeen much among mountains as especially horrid. Flinders' burst of\r\nchilled feeling may therefore be noted as a curious psychological fact.*\r\n(* The reader will perhaps find it interesting to compare this reference\r\nwith a passage in Ruskin's Modern Painters Volume 3 chapter 13: \"It is\r\nsufficiently notable that Homer, living in mountainous and rocky\r\ncountries, dwells thus delightedly on all the flat bits; and so I think\r\ninvariably the inhabitants of mountain countries do, but the inhabitants\r\nof the plains do not, in any similar way, dwell delightedly on mountains.\r\nThe Dutch painters are perfectly contented with their flat fields and\r\npollards: Rubens, though he had seen the Alps, usually composes his\r\nlandscapes of a hay-field or two, plenty of pollards and willows, a\r\ndistant spire, a Dutch house with a mast about it, a windmill and a\r\nditch...So Shakspere never speaks of mountains with the slightest joy,\r\nbut only of lowland flowers, flat fields, and Warwickshire streams.\"\r\nRuskin's citation of the Lincolnshire farmer in Alton Locke is apt, with\r\nhis dislike of \"Darned ups and downs o'hills, to shake a body's victuals\r\nout of his inwards.\")\r\n\r\nThe naming of Mounts Heemskirk and Zeehan, the latter since become a\r\nmineral centre of vast wealth, were the most noteworthy events of the run\r\ndown the western coast. They were named by Flinders after the two ships\r\nof Tasman, as he took them to be the two mountains seen by that navigator\r\non his discovery of Van Diemen's Land in 1642.\r\n\r\nThe Derwent, whose estuary is the port of Hobart, was entered on December\r\n21. Bass's report on the fertility of the soil led to the choice of this\r\nlocality for a settlement four years later.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the year the return voyage was commenced, and on\r\nJanuary 1st, 1799, the Norfolk was making for Port Jackson with her prow\r\nset north-easterly. The winds were unfavourable, and prevented Flinders\r\nfrom keeping close inshore, as he would have liked to do in order to make\r\na survey. But the prescribed period of absence having expired, and the\r\nprovisions being nearly exhausted, it was necessary to make as much haste\r\nas possible. On January 8th the Babel Isles were marked down, and named\r\n\"because of the confusion of noises made by the geese, shags, penguins,\r\ngulls, and sooty petrels.\" Anyone who has camped near a rookery of sooty\r\npetrels is aware that they are quite capable of maintaining a\r\nsufficiently \"babelish confusion\"--the phrase is Camden's--without any\r\naid from other fowls.\r\n\r\nA little later in the month (January 12) the Norfolk sailed into harbour,\r\nand was anchored alongside the Reliance. \"To the strait which had been\r\nthe great object of research,\" wrote Flinders, \"and whose discovery was\r\nnow completed, Governor Hunter gave at my recommendation the name of Bass\r\nStrait. This was no more than a just tribute to my worthy friend and\r\ncompanion for the extreme dangers and fatigues he had undergone in first\r\nentering it in the whaleboat, and to the correct judgment he had formed,\r\nfrom various indications, of the existence of a wide opening between Van\r\nDiemen's Land and New South Wales.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout this voyage we find Bass expending his abundant energies in\r\nthe making of inland excursions whenever an opportunity occurred. To take\r\na boat up rivers, to cut through rough country, to climb, examine soil,\r\nmake notes on birds and beasts, and exercise his enquiring mind in all\r\ndirections, was his constant delight.\r\n\r\nThe profusion of wild life upon the coasts and islands explored during\r\nthe voyage astonished the travellers. Seals were seen in thousands,\r\nsea-birds in hundreds of millions. Flinders' calculation regarding the\r\nsooty petrels has already been quoted. Black swans were observed in great\r\nquantities. Bass, for example, stated that he saw three hundred of these\r\nstately birds within a space a quarter of a mile square. The Roman poet\r\nJuvenal could think of no better example of a thing of rare occurrence\r\nthan a black swan:\r\n\r\n\"Rara avis in terris, nigroque simillima cygno.\"\r\n\r\nBut here black swans could have been cited in a simile illustrating\r\nprofusion. Bass quaintly stated that the \"dying song\" of the swan, so\r\ncelebrated by poets, \"exactly resembled the creaking of a rusty ale-house\r\nsign on a windy day.\" The remark is not so pretty as, but far more true\r\nthan, that of the bard who would have us believe that the dying swan:\r\n\r\n\"In music's strains breathes out her life and verse,\r\nAnd, chaunting her own dirge, rides on her watery hearse.\"\r\n\r\nThe couplet of Coleridge is vitiated by the same error, but may merit\r\ncommendation for practical wisdom:\r\n\r\n\"Swans sing before they die; 'twere no bad thing\r\nShould certain persons die before they sing.\"\r\n\r\nFlinders also saw from three to five hundred black swans on the lee side\r\nof one point; and so tame were they that, as the Norfolk passed through\r\nthe midst of them, one incautious bird was caught by the neck.\r\n\r\nBass went ashore on Albatross Island to shoot. He was forced to fight his\r\nway up the cliffs against the seals, which resented the intrusion; and\r\nwhen he got to the top he was compelled \"to make a road with his club\r\namong the albatross. These birds were sitting upon their nests, and\r\nalmost covered the surface of the ground, nor did they otherwise derange\r\nthemselves for their new visitors than to peck at their legs as they\r\npassed by.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Derwent Bass and Flinders encountered Tasmanian aboriginals, now\r\nan extinct race of men. A human voice was heard coming from the hills.\r\nThe two leaders of the expedition landed, taking with them a swan as an\r\noffering of friendship, and met an aboriginal man and two women. The\r\nwomen ran off, but the man stayed and accepted the swan \"with rapture.\"\r\nHe was armed with three spears, but his demeanour was friendly. Bass and\r\nFlinders tried him with such words as they knew of the dialects of New\r\nSouth Wales and the South Sea Islands, but could not make him understand\r\nthem, \"though the quickness with which he comprehended our signs spoke in\r\nfavour of his intelligence.\" His hair was either close-cropped or\r\nnaturally short; but it had not a woolly appearance. \"He acceded to our\r\nproposition of going to his hut; but finding from his devious route and\r\nfrequent stoppings that he sought to tire our patience, we left him\r\ndelighted with the certain possession of his swan, and returned to the\r\nboat. This was the sole opportunity we had of communicating with any of\r\nthe natives of Van Diemen's Land.\"\r\n\r\nThe results of the cruise of the Norfolk were of great importance. From\r\nthe purely utilitarian point of view, the discovery of Bass Strait\r\nshortened the voyage to Sydney from Europe by quite a week. It opened a\r\nnew highway for commerce. Turnbull, in his Voyage Round the World (1814)\r\ndiscussing the advantages of the new route, mentioned that \"already has\r\nthe whole fleet of China ships, under the convoy of a 64, passed through\r\nthese Straits without the smallest accident;\" and he pointed out that\r\nships which were late in the season for China, and availed themselves of\r\nthe prevailing winds by taking the easterly route round Australia, were\r\nthus enabled to avoid the tempestuous weather which generally faced them\r\nto the south of Van Diemen's Land. Governor King, too, writing to the\r\nGovernor of Bombay in 1802, sent him a chart of the strait, and pointed\r\nout that the discovery would \"greatly facilitate the passage of ships\r\nfrom India to this colony.\"\r\n\r\nThe discovery also revealed a fresh and fertile field for the occupation\r\nof mankind. Geographically no discovery of such consequence had been made\r\nsince the noble days of Cook. It brought the names of Bass and Flinders\r\nprominently before the scientific world, and the thoroughness with which\r\nthe latter had done his work won him warm praise from men competent to\r\nform a judgment. Intimations concerning the discovery published in the\r\nNaval Chronicle and other journals valued the work very highly; and it\r\nhad the advantage of bringing the commander of the Norfolk under the\r\nnotice of Sir Joseph Banks, that earnest and steadfast supporter of all\r\nsincere research work, who thus became the firm friend of Flinders, as he\r\nhad been the friend and associate of Cook thirty years before.\r\n\r\nThe turbulent state of Europe in and about 1799, with Napoleon Bonaparte\r\nrising fast to meridian glory on the wings of war, did not incline\r\nBritish statesmen to attach much significance to such events as the\r\ndiscovery of an important strait and the increased opportunities for the\r\ndevelopment of oversea dominions. Renewed activity in that direction came\r\na little later. There is a letter from Banks to Hunter, written just\r\nafter the return of the Norfolk, but before the news reached England\r\n(February, 1799), wherein he conveys a concise idea of the perturbation\r\nin official circles and the difficulty of getting anything done for\r\nAustralia. \"The political situation is so difficult,\" said Banks, \"and\r\nHis Majesty's Ministers so fully employed in business of the deepest\r\nimportance, that it is scarce possible to gain a moment's audience on any\r\nsubject but those which stand foremost in their minds; and colonies of\r\nall kinds, you may be assured, are now put into the background.\"\r\n\r\nBut that was no more than a passing phase. The seeds of a vaster British\r\nEmpire than had ever existed before had already germinated, and when the\r\nyears of crisis occurred, the will and power of England were both ready\r\nand strong enough to protect the growing plant from the trampling feet of\r\nlegions. Meanwhile, the work on the Norfolk secured for Flinders such\r\nuseful encouragement and help as enabled him very little later to crown\r\nhis achievements with a task that at once solidified his title to fame\r\nand ultimately ended his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. THE FATE OF GEORGE BASS.\r\n\r\nIt has been already mentioned that Bass Strait was named by Governor\r\nHunter on the recommendation of Flinders. There is no reason to suppose\r\nthat George Bass himself made any claim that his name should be applied\r\nto his discovery. One derives the impression, from a study of his\r\ncharacter as revealed in his words and acts, that he would have been\r\nperfectly content had some other name been chosen. He was one of those\r\nrare men who find their principal joy in the free exercise of an intrepid\r\nand masculine energy, especially in directions affording a stimulus to\r\nintellectual curiosity. He did not even write a book or an essay about\r\nthe work he had done. The whaleboat voyage was tersely recorded in a\r\ndiary for the information of the Governor; his other material was handed\r\nover to Collins for the purposes of his History of New South Wales, and\r\nBass went about his business unrewarded, officially unhonoured.\r\n\r\nIt is curiously significant of the modesty of this really notable man\r\nthat when, in 1801, he again sailed to Australia, he mentioned quite\r\ncasually in a letter that he had passed through Bass Strait without any\r\nreference to his own connection with the passage. It was not, to him,\r\n\"the strait which I discovered,\" or \"my strait,\" or \"the strait named\r\nafter me,\" but simply Bass Strait, giving it the proper geographical name\r\nscored on the map, just as he might have mentioned the name of any other\r\npart of the globe traversed during the voyage. The natural pride of the\r\ndiscoverer assuredly would have been no evidence of egotism; but Bass was\r\nsingularly free from all semblance of human weakness of that kind. The\r\ndifficulties battled with, the effort joyfully made, the discovery\r\naccomplished, he appears hardly to have thought any more about his own\r\npart in it. Not only his essential modesty but his affectionate nature\r\nand the frank charm of his manner are apparent in such of his letters as\r\nhave been preserved.\r\n\r\nThe association of Bass with Flinders was fruitful in achievement, and\r\ntheir friendship was perfect in its manliness; it is pathetic to realise\r\nthat when they parted, within a few weeks after the return of the Norfolk\r\nto Sydney, these two men, still young in years and rich in hope, ability\r\nand enterprise, were never to meet again.\r\n\r\nAs from this time Bass disappears from the story of his friend's life,\r\nwhat is known of his later years may be here related. His fate is a\r\nmystery that has never been satisfactorily cleared up, and perhaps never\r\nwill be. He returned to England \"shortly after\" the voyage of the\r\nNorfolk. So wrote Flinders; but \"shortly after\" means later than April,\r\n1799, for in that month Bass sat on a board of inquiry into the Isaac\r\nNicholls case, to be mentioned again hereafter.\r\n\r\nIn England, Bass married Elizabeth Waterhouse, sister of his old shipmate\r\nHenry Waterhouse, the captain of the Reliance. With a wife to maintain,\r\nhe was apparently dissatisfied with his pay and prospects as a naval\r\nsurgeon. Nor was he quite the kind of man who would, in the full flush of\r\nhis restless energy, settle down to the ordinary practice of his\r\nprofession. Confined to a daily routine in some English town, he would\r\nhave been like a caged albatross pining for regions of illimitable blue.\r\n\r\nWithin three months of his marriage Bass had become managing owner of a\r\nsmart little 140-ton brig, the Venus, in a venture in which a syndicate\r\nof friends had invested 10,890 pounds. In the early part of 1801 he\r\nsailed in her with a general cargo of merchandise for Port Jackson. The\r\nbrig, which carried twelve guns--for England was at war, and there were\r\nrisks to be run\r\n--was a fast sailer, teak-built and copper-sheathed, and was described as\r\n\"one of the most complete, handsome and strong-built ships in the River\r\nThames, and will suit any trade.\" She was loaded \"as deep as she can swim\r\nand as full as an egg,\" Bass wrote to his brother-in-law; and there is\r\nthe sailor's jovial pleasure in a good ship, with, perhaps, a suggestion\r\nof the surgeon's point of view, in his declaration that she was \"very\r\nsound and tight, and bids fair to remain sound much longer than any of\r\nher owners.\"\r\n\r\nBut the speculation was not an immediate success. The market was \"glutted\r\nwith goods beyond all comparison,\" in addition to which Governor King,\r\nwho succeeded Hunter in 1800, was conducting the affairs of the\r\nsettlement upon a plan of the most rigid economy. \"Our wings are clipped\r\nwith a vengeance, but we shall endeavour to fall on our feet somehow or\r\nother,\" wrote Bass early in October, 1801.\r\n\r\nA contract made with the Governor, to bring salt pork from Tahiti at\r\nsixpence per pound, provided profitable employment for the Venus. Hogs\r\nwere plentiful in the Society Islands, and could be procured cheaply. The\r\narrangement commended itself to the thrifty Governor, who had hitherto\r\nbeen paying a shilling per pound for pork, and it kept Bass actively\r\nengaged. He was \"tired of civilised life.\" There was, too, money to be\r\nmade, and he sent home satisfactory bills \"to stop a few holes in my\r\ndebts.\" \"That pork voyage,\" he wrote to his brother-in-law, \"has been our\r\nfirst successful speculation\"; and he spoke again in fond admiration of\r\nthe Venus; \"she is just the same vessel as when we left England, never\r\ncomplains or cries, though we loaded her with pork most unmercifully.\"\r\nWhile he was pursuing this trade, the French expedition under Baudin\r\nvisited Sydney, and they, on their chart of Wilson's Promontory gave the\r\nname of Venus Bay to an inlet on the west side of Cape Liptrap. They also\r\nbought goods to the extent of 359 pounds 10 shillings from \"Mr. George\r\nBasse.\"* (* Manuscript accounts of Baudin, Archives Nationales BB4 999.)\r\n\r\nBass now secured fishing concessions in New Zealand waters, from which he\r\nhoped much. \"The fishery is not to be put in motion till after my return\r\nto old England,\" he wrote in January, 1803. Then, he said playfully, \"I\r\nmean to seize upon my dear Bess, bring her out here, and make a poissarde\r\nof her, where she cannot fail to find plenty of ease for her tongue. We\r\nhave, I assure you, great plans in our heads, but, like the basket of\r\neggs, all depends upon the success of the voyage I am now upon.\" It was\r\nthe voyage from which he never returned.\r\n\r\nThere is another charming allusion to his wife in a letter written from\r\nTahiti: \"I would joke Bess upon the attractive charms of Tahiti females\r\nbut that they have been so much belied in their beauty that she might\r\nthink me attracted in good earnest. However, there is nothing to fear\r\nhere.\" He speaks of her again in writing to his brother: \"I have written\r\nto my beloved wife, and do most sincerely lament that we are so far\r\nasunder. The next voyage I have she must make with me, for I shall badly\r\npass it without her.\" The pathos of his reference to her in a letter of\r\nOctober, 1801, can be felt in its note of manly sympathy, and is deepened\r\nby the recollection that the young bride never saw him again. \"Our dear\r\nBess talks of seeing me in eighteen months. Alas! poor Bess, the when is\r\nuncertain, very uncertain in everything except its long distances. Turn\r\nour eyes where we will, we see nothing but glutted markets around us.\"\r\n\r\nThe pork-procuring ventures continued till 1803. In that year Bass\r\narranged to sail beyond Tahiti to the Chilian coast, to buy other\r\nprovisions for the use of the colony. Whether he intended to force the\r\nhand of fortune by engaging in the contraband trade can only be inferred.\r\nThat there was certainly a large amount of illicit traffic with South\r\nAmerica on the part of venturesome captains who made use of Port Jackson\r\nas a harbour of refuge, is clear from extant documents.\r\n\r\nThe position was this. The persistent policy of Spain in the government\r\nof her South American possessions was to conserve trade exclusively for\r\nSpanish ships and Spanish merchants; and for this purpose several\r\nrestrictions were imposed upon unauthorised foreign traders. Nevertheless\r\nthe inhabitants of these colonies urgently required more goods than were\r\nimported under such excessive limitations, and wanted to get them much\r\ncheaper than was possible while monopoly and heavy taxation prevailed.\r\nThere was, consequently, a tempting inducement to skippers who were\r\nsufficiently bold to take risks, to ship goods for Chili and Peru, and\r\nrun them in at some place along the immense coast-line, evading the lazy\r\neyes of perfunctory Spanish officials, or securing their corrupt\r\nconnivance by bribes. Contraband trade was, in fact, extensively\r\npractised, and plenty of people in the Spanish colonies throve on it. As\r\na modern historian writes: \"The vast extent of the border of Spain's\r\npossessions made it impossible for her to guard it efficiently. Smuggling\r\ncould therefore be carried on with impunity, and the high prices which\r\nhad been given to European wares in America by the system of restriction,\r\nconstituted a sufficient inducement to lead the merchants of other\r\nnations to engage in contraband trade.\"* The profits from success were\r\ngreat; but the consequences of detection were disastrous. (* Bernard\r\nMoses, Spanish Rule in America, 289.)\r\n\r\nNow Bass, as already related, had brought out to Sydney in the Venus a\r\nlarge quantity of unsaleable merchandise. He could not dispose of it\r\nunder conditions of glut. He had hoped that the Governor would take the\r\ncargo into the Government store and let it be sold even at a 50 per cent\r\nreduction. But King declined to permit that to be done. Here, then, was a\r\nsingularly courageous man, fond of daring enterprises, in command of a\r\ngood ship, with an unsaleable cargo on his hands. On the other side of\r\nthe Pacific was a country where such a cargo might, with luck, be sold at\r\na bounding profit. He could easily find out how the trade was done. There\r\nwas more than one among those with whom he would associate in Sydney who\r\nknew a great deal about it.\r\n\r\nOne or two sentences in Bass's last letters to Henry Waterhouse contain\r\nmysterious hints, which to him, with his experience of Port Jackson,\r\nwould be significant. He explained that he intended taking the Venus to\r\nvisit the coast of Chili in search of provisions, \"and that they may not\r\nin that part of the world mistake me for a contrabandist, I go provided\r\nwith a very diplomatic-looking certificate from the Governor here,\r\nstating the service upon which I am employed, requesting aid and\r\nprotection in obtaining the food wanted. And God grant you may fully\r\nsucceed, says your warm heart, in so benevolent an object; and thus also\r\nsay I; Amen, say many others of my friends.\"\r\n\r\nBut was the diplomatic-looking paper intended rather to serve as a screen\r\nthan as a guarantee of bona fides? \"In a few hours,\" wrote Bass at the\r\nbeginning of February, 1803, \"I sail again on another pork voyage, but it\r\ncombines circumstances of a different nature also\"; and at the end of the\r\nsame letter he added: \"Speak not of South America to anyone out of your\r\nfamily, for there is treason in the very name.\" What did he mean by that?\r\nHe spoke of \"digging gold in South America,\" and clearly did not mean it\r\nin the strict literal sense.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Governor was anxious to get South American cattle and\r\nbeef for the settlement in Sydney, but can that have been the only motive\r\nfor a voyage beyond Tahiti? \"If our approaching voyage proves at all\r\nfortunate in its issue, I expect to make a handsome thing out of it, and\r\nto be much expedited on my return to old England,\" Bass wrote in January.\r\nHe would not have been likely to make so very handsome a thing out of\r\nbeef in one voyage, to enable him to expedite his return to England.\r\n\r\nThe factors of the case are, then, that Bass had on his hands a large\r\nquantity of goods which he had failed to sell in Sydney; that there was a\r\nconsiderable and enormously profitable contraband trade with South\r\nAmerica at the time; that he expected to make a very large and rapid\r\nprofit out of the venture he was about to undertake; that he warned\r\nWaterhouse against mentioning the matter outside the family circle, \"for\r\nthere is treason in the very name\"; and that he was himself a man\r\ndistinguished by dash and daring, who was very anxious to make a\r\nsubstantial sum and return to England soon. The inference from his\r\nlanguage and circumstances as to the scheme he had in hand is\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\nThe \"very diplomatic-looking certificate\" which the Governor gave him was\r\ndated February 3, 1803. It certified that \"Mr. George Bass, of the\r\nbrigantine Venus, has been employed since the first day of November,\r\n1801, upon His Britannic Majesty's service in procuring provisions for\r\nthe subsistence of His Majesty's colony, and still continues using those\r\nexertions;\" and it went on to affirm that should he find it expedient to\r\nresort to any harbour in His Catholic Majesty's dominions upon the west\r\ncoast of America, \"this instrument is intended to declare my full belief\r\nthat his sole object in going there will be to procure food, without any\r\nview to private commerce or any other view whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the terms of this certificate, however, there is clear\r\nevidence that Governor King was fully aware of the nature of the trade\r\nconducted with the Spanish-American colonies by vessels using Port\r\nJackson; and though it may be that Bass did not tell him in so many words\r\nwhat his whole intentions were, King knew that Bass had a large stock of\r\ncommodities to sell, and could hardly have been ignorant that a\r\nconsiderable portion of them were re-shipped on the Venus for this\r\nvoyage. In a later despatch he alluded to vessels which carried goods\r\n\"from hence to the coasts of the Spanish possessions on the west side of\r\nAmerica,\" and he observed \"that this must be a forced trade, similar to\r\nthat carried on among the settlements of that nation and Portugal on the\r\neast side of America, and that much risk will attend it to the\r\nadventurers.\"\r\n\r\nBass sailed from Sydney on February 5th, 1803. He never returned, and no\r\nsatisfactory account of what became of him is forthcoming.* (* The writer\r\nof the article on Bass in the Dictionary of National Biography says that\r\n\"except that he left Australia in 1799 to return to England nothing\r\ncertain is known of Bass's subsequent history.\" But we know fairly fully\r\nwhat he was doing up till February, 1803, as related above. The Bass\r\nmystery commences after that date. The Encyclopaedia Britannica (11th\r\nedition) finds no space for a separate article on this very remarkable\r\nman.) Later in 1803 the brig Harrington, herself concerned in the\r\ncontraband trade, reported that the Venus had been captured and\r\nconfiscated by the Spaniards in Peru, and that Bass and the mate, Scott,\r\nhad been sent as prisoners to the silver mines. In December, 1804,\r\nGovernor King remarked in a despatch to the Secretary of State that he\r\nhad been \"in constant expectation\" of hearing from Bass, \"to whom, there\r\nis no doubt, some accident has occurred.\" The Harrington had reported the\r\ncapture of the Venus before King wrote that. Why did he not mention the\r\ncircumstance to the British Government? Why did he not allude to the\r\ncountry to which he well knew that Bass intended to sail? It would seem\r\nthat King carefully avoided referring in his official despatches to an\r\nenterprise upon which he had good reason to be aware that Bass had\r\nembarked.\r\n\r\nWar between Great Britain and Spain did not break out till December,\r\n1804, after the seizure of the Spanish treasure fleet by British frigates\r\noff Cadiz (October 5th). But in previous years, while Spain, under\r\npressure from Napoleon, lent her countenance to his aggressive policy,\r\nEnglish privateers had freely plundered Spanish commerce in the south\r\nPacific, and some of them had brought their prizes to Sydney. That this\r\nwas done with the knowledge of the authorities cannot be doubted.\r\nEverybody knew about it. When the French exploring ships were lying at\r\nSydney in 1802, Peron saw there vessels \"provided with arms, fitting out\r\nfor the western coast of America, stored with merchandise of various\r\nkinds. These vessels were intended to establish, by force of arms, a\r\ncontraband commerce with the inhabitants of Peru, extremely advantageous\r\nto both parties.\"\r\n\r\nIt would not, therefore, be wonderful that the Spanish authorities in\r\nChili or Peru should regard Port Jackson as a kind of wasp's nest, and\r\nshould look with suspicion on any vessel coming thence which might fall\r\ninto their hands, however much her commander might endeavour to make of\r\nhis official certificate declaring the Governor's \"full belief\" in his\r\nlawful intentions. The irritation caused by the use that was being made\r\nof Sydney as a privateering and contraband base of operations can be well\r\nimagined. As early as December, 1799, indeed, Governor Hunter related\r\nthat a captured Spanish merchant vessel had been brought into port, and\r\nhe acknowledged that \"this being the second Spanish prize brought hither,\r\nwe cannot be surprised, should it be known that such captures make a\r\nconvenience of this harbour, if it should provoke a visit from some of\r\nthe ships of war from the Spanish settlements on that coast.\" The\r\nSpaniards would naturally be thirsting for revenge; and a ship sailing\r\ndirect from the port of which the raiders made a \"convenience\" would be\r\nliable to feel their ire, should there be the semblance of provocation.\r\nThe authorities would have been justified in holding up the Venus if they\r\nsuspected that she carried contraband goods; and their treatment of her\r\nofficers and crew might be expected to reflect the temper of their\r\ndisposition towards Port Jackson and all that concerned it.\r\n\r\nIf, as the Harrington reported, Bass and his companions were sent to the\r\nmines, the Spanish officials managed their act of punishment, or revenge,\r\nvery quietly. But at that time there was not a formal state of\r\nbelligerency between England and Spain, though the tension of public\r\nfeeling in Great Britain concerning Spanish relations with France was\r\nacute. If it were considered that such an act as the seizure of the Venus\r\nwould be likely to precipitate a declaration of war, the motive for\r\nsecrecy was strong. Secrecy, moreover, would have been in complete\r\nconformity with Spanish methods in South America. It is not recorded\r\nwhether the seizure of the Venus occurred at Callao, Valparaiso or\r\nValdivia; but a British lieutenant, Fitzmaurice, who was at Valparaiso\r\nfive years later, heard that a man named Bass had been in Lima some years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nA friend of the Bass family residing at Lincoln in 1852 wrote a letter to\r\nSamuel Sidney, the author of The Three Colonies of Australia, stating\r\nthat Bass's mother last heard of him \"in the Straits of China.\" But this\r\nwas evidently an error of memory. If Bass ever got out of South America,\r\nhe would have written to his \"dear Bess,\" to Waterhouse, and to Flinders.\r\nThe latter, in 1814, wrote of him as \"alas, now no more.\" There is on\r\nrecord a report that he was seen alive in South America in that year, but\r\nthe story is doubtful. He was a man full of affectionate loyalty to his\r\nfriends, and it is not conceivable that he would have left them without\r\nnews of him if any channel of communication had been open, as would have\r\nbeen the case had he been at liberty as late as 1814. His father-in-law\r\nmade enquiries, but failed to obtain news. The report of the Harrington\r\nwas probably true, but beyond that we really have no information upon\r\nwhich we can depend. The internal history of Spanish America has been\r\nvery scantily investigated, and it is quite possible that even yet some\r\ndiligent student of archives may find, some day, particulars concerning\r\nthe fate of this brave and adventurous spirit.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of Bass's letters to his mother is a misfortune which\r\nthe student of Australian history must deplore. He was observant, shrewd,\r\nan untiring traveller, and an entertaining correspondent. He probably\r\nrelated to his mother, to whom he wrote frequently, the story of his\r\nexcursions and experiences, and the historical value of all that he wrote\r\nwould be very great. The letters, said the Lincoln friend, were long,\r\n\"containing full accounts of his discoveries.\" His mother treasured them\r\ntill she died, when they came into the possession of a Miss Calder. She\r\nkept them in a box, and used occasionally to amuse herself by reading\r\nthem. But some time before 1852 Miss Calder went to the box to look at\r\nthem again, and found that they had disappeared. Whether she had lent\r\nthem to some person who had failed to return them, or had mislaid them,\r\nis unknown. It is possible that they may still be in existence in some\r\ndusty cupboard in England, and that we may even yet be gratified by an\r\nexamination of documents which would assuredly enable us to understand\r\nmore of the noble soul of George Bass.\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned that Flinders and Bass did not meet again after the\r\nvoyage of the Norfolk and Bass's return to England. Though Sydney was the\r\nbase of both Flinders in the Investigator and Bass in the Venus in 1802\r\nand 1803, they always had the ill-luck to miss each other. Bass was at\r\nTahiti while Flinders lay in port from May 9th to July 21st, 1802. He\r\nreturned in November, and left once more on his final voyage in February,\r\n1803. Flinders arrived in Sydney again, after his exploration of the Gulf\r\nof Carpentaria, in June, 1803. A farewell letter from him to his friend\r\nis quoted in a later chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. ON THE QUEENSLAND COAST.\r\n\r\nTwo more incidents in the career of Flinders will concern us before we\r\ndeal with his important later voyages. The first of these is only worth\r\nmentioning for the light it throws upon the character of the man. In\r\nMarch, 1799, he sat as a member of a court of criminal judicature in\r\nSydney, for the trial of Isaac Nichols, who was charged with receiving a\r\nbasket of tobacco knowing it to have been stolen. The case aroused\r\npassionate interest at the time. People in the settlement took sides upon\r\nit, as upon a matter of acute party politics, and the Governor was hotly\r\nat variance with the Judge Advocate, the chief judicial officer.\r\n\r\nNichols had been a convict, but his conduct was good, and he was chosen\r\nto be chief overseer of a gang employed in labour of various kinds. On\r\nthe expiration of his sentence, he acquired a small farm, and by means of\r\nsobriety and industry built himself a comfortable house. Through his very\r\nprosperity he became \"an object to be noticed,\" as the Governor wrote,\r\nand by reason of his diligent usefulness securing him official\r\nemployment, \"he stood in the way of others.\" In Hunter's opinion, the\r\nruin of Nichols was deliberately planned; and he was convicted on what\r\nthe Governor believed to be false and malicious evidence.\r\n\r\nThe striking feature of the trial was that the Court (consisting of seven\r\nmembers--three naval officers and three officers of the New South Wales\r\nCorps, presided over by the Judge Advocate) was sharply divided in\r\nopinion. The three naval men, Flinders, Waterhouse, and Lieutenant Kent,\r\nwere convinced of the accused man's innocence; the three military men,\r\nwith the Judge Advocate, voted for his conviction. There was thus a\r\nmajority against Nichols; but the Governor, believing that an injustice\r\nwas being done, suspended the execution of the sentence, and submitted\r\nthe papers to the Secretary of State. Bass came into the matter in the\r\nmonth after the trial, as a member of a Court of Inquiry into the\r\nallegation that certain persons had carried the tobacco to Nichols' house\r\nwith the object of implicating him.\r\n\r\nThe only point that need concern us here, is that Flinders wrote a\r\nmemorandum analysing the evidence with minute care, in justification of\r\nhis belief in the prisoner's innocence. It was a skilfully drawn\r\ndocument, and it exhibits Flinders in a light which enhances our respect\r\nfor him, as the strong champion of an accused man whom he believed to be\r\nwronged. In the result, the Crown granted a pardon to Nichols; but this\r\ndid not arrive till 1802, so tardy was justice in getting itself done.\r\nApart from Flinders' share in it, the case is interesting as revealing\r\nthe strained relations existing between the principal officials in the\r\ncolony at the time. The Judge Advocate was a bitter enemy of the\r\nGovernor, and the very administration of the law, affecting the liberties\r\nof the people, was tinctured by these animosities.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to turn from so grimy a subject to the work for which\r\nFlinders' tastes and talents peculiarly fitted him. The explorations\r\nwhich he had hitherto accomplished were sufficient to convince Hunter\r\nthat he had under him an officer from whom good work could be expected,\r\nand, the Reliance not being required for service, he readily acquiesced\r\nwhen Flinders proposed that he should take the Norfolk northward, to\r\nMoreton Bay, the \"Glasshouse Bay\" of Cook, and Hervey Bay, east of\r\nBundaberg. On this voyage he was accompanied by his younger brother,\r\nSamuel Flinders. He also took with him an aboriginal named Bongaree,\r\n\"whose good disposition and manly conduct had attracted my esteem.\"\r\n\r\nHe sailed on July 8th. The task did not occupy much time, for the sloop\r\nwas back in Sydney by August 20th. The results were disappointing. It had\r\nbeen hoped to find large rivers, and by means of them to penetrate the\r\ninterior of the country; but none were found.\r\n\r\nFlinders missed the Clarence, though he actually anchored off its\r\nentrance. Nor did he find the Brisbane, though, ascending the Glasshouse\r\nMountains, he saw indications of a river, which he could not enter with\r\nthe Norfolk on account of the intricacy of the channel and the shortness\r\nof the time available.\r\n\r\nUneasiness of mind respecting the condition of the sloop must have had\r\nmuch to do with the missing of the rivers. She sprung a leak two days out\r\nof Port Jackson, and this was \"a serious cause of alarm,\" the more so as\r\ngrains of maize, with which the Norfolk had been previously loaded, were\r\nconstantly choking up the pump. Weather conditions, also, did not favour\r\ntaking the vessel close inshore on her northward course, and it would\r\nhave been almost impossible to detect the mouths of the New South Wales\r\nrivers without a close scrutiny of the coastline. Those considerations\r\nare quite sufficient, when duly weighed, to account for the omissions. It\r\ncertainly was a rash statement, after so imperfect an examination, that\r\n\"however mortifying the conviction might be, it was then an ascertained\r\nfact that no river of importance intersected the east coast between the\r\n24th and 39th degrees of south latitude.\" But it is equally certain that\r\nhe could not have found these rivers with the means at his disposal. They\r\ncould not well have been observed from the deck of a vessel off the\r\ncoast.* (* See Coote, History of Queensland, 1 7, and Lang, Cooksland,\r\npage 17.) A closer inspection of the shore-line was required. In fact,\r\nthe rivers were not found by seaward exploration; they were discovered by\r\ninland travellers.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting features of the voyage lay in the meeting with\r\naboriginals in Moreton Bay. Some of the incidents were amusing, though at\r\none time there seemed to be danger of a serious encounter. Flinders went\r\nashore to meet a party of the natives, and endeavoured to establish\r\nfriendly relations with them. But as he was leaving, one of them threw a\r\nspear. Flinders snatched up his gun and aimed at the offender, but the\r\nflint being wet missed fire. A second snap of the trigger also failed,\r\nbut on a third trial the gun went off, though nobody was hurt. Flinders\r\nthought that it might obviate future mischief if he gave the blacks an\r\nidea of his power, so he fired at a man who was hiding behind a tree; but\r\nwithout doing him any harm. The sound of the gun caused the greatest\r\nconsternation among the natives, and the small party of white men had no\r\nmore serious trouble with them while they were in the bay. Flinders was\r\n\"satisfied of the great influence which the use of a superior power has\r\nin savages to create respect and render their communications friendly\";\r\nbut he was fortunately able to keep on good terms without resort to\r\nseverity.\r\n\r\nAn effort to tickle the aboriginal sense of humour was a failure. Two of\r\nthe crew who were Scotch, commenced to dance a reel for the amusement of\r\nthe blacks. \"For want of music,\" it is related, \"they made a very bad\r\nperformance, which was contemplated by the natives without much amusement\r\nor curiosity.\" The joke, like Flinders' gun, missed fire. There have\r\nbeen, it is often alleged, other occasions when jokes made by Scotsmen\r\nhave not achieved a shining success; and we do well to respect the\r\nintention while we deplore the waste of effort.\r\n\r\nAn example of cunning which did not succeed occurred shortly after the\r\nfirst landing. Flinders was wearing a cabbage-tree hat, for which a\r\nnative had a fancy. The fellow took a long stick with a hook at the end\r\nof it, and, laughing and talking to divert attention from his purpose,\r\nendeavoured to take the hat from the commander's head. His detection\r\ncreated much laughter; as did that of another black with long arms, who\r\ntried to creep up to snatch the hat, but was afraid to approach too near.\r\nThe account which Collins, writing from Flinders' notes, gave of the\r\nQueensland natives seen at Moreton Bay, is graphic but hardly attractive.\r\nTwo paragraphs about their musical attainments and their general\r\nappearance will bear quotation:--\r\n\r\n\"These people, like the natives of Port Jackson, having fallen to the low\r\npitch of their voices, recommenced their song at the octave, which was\r\naccompanied by slow and not ungraceful motions of the body and limbs,\r\ntheir hands being held up in a supplicating posture; and the tone and\r\nmanner of their song and gestures seemed to bespeak the goodwill and\r\nforbearance of their auditors. Observing that they were attentively\r\nlistened to, they each selected one of our people and placed his mouth\r\nclose to his ear, as if to produce a greater effect, or, it might be, to\r\nteach them the song, which their silent attention might seem to express a\r\ndesire to learn.\" As a recompense for the amusement they had afforded him\r\nFlinders gave them some worsted caps, and a pair of blanket trousers,\r\nwith which they seemed well pleased. Several other natives now made their\r\nappearance; and it was some time before they could overcome their dread\r\nof approaching the strangers with the firearms; but, encouraged by the\r\nthree who were with them, they came up, and a general song and dance was\r\ncommenced. Their singing was not confined to one air; they gave three.\r\n\r\n\"Of those who came last, three were remarkable for the largeness of their\r\nheads, and one, whose face was very rough, had much more the appearance\r\nof a baboon than of a human being. He was covered with oily soot; his\r\nhair matted with filth; his visage, even among his fellows, uncommonly\r\nferocious; and his very large mouth, beset with teeth of every hue\r\nbetween black, white, green and yellow, sometimes presented a smile which\r\nmight make anyone shudder.\"\r\n\r\nThe Norfolk remained fifteen days in Moreton Bay. The judgment that\r\nFlinders formed of it was that it was \"so full of shoals that he could\r\nnot attempt to point out any passage that would lead a ship into it\r\nwithout danger.\" The east side was not sounded, and he was of opinion\r\nthat if a good navigable channel existed it would be found there. His\r\nvisit to Hervey Bay, further north, did not lead to any interesting\r\nobservations. He left there on his return voyage on August 7th, and\r\nreached Port Jackson at dusk on the 20th.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12. THE INVESTIGATOR.\r\n\r\nFlinders sailed from Port Jackson for England in the Reliance on March\r\n3rd, 1800. The old ship was in such a bad condition that Governor Hunter\r\n\"judged it proper to order her home while she may be capable of\r\nperforming the voyage.\" She carried despatches, which Captain Waterhouse\r\nwas directed to throw overboard in the event of meeting with an enemy's\r\nship of superior force and being unable to effect his escape. She lived\r\nthrough a tempestuous voyage, making nine or ten inches of water per\r\nhour, according to the carpenter's report, and providing plenty of\r\npumping exercise for a couple of convict stowaways who emerged from\r\nhiding two days out of Sydney. At St. Helena, reached at the end of May,\r\ncompany was joined with four East India ships, and off Ireland H.M.S.\r\nCerberus took charge of the convoy till the arrival at Portsmouth on\r\nAugust 26th.\r\n\r\nWhen Flinders left England six years before, he was a midshipman. He\r\npassed the examination qualifying him to become lieutenant at the Cape of\r\nGood Hope in 1797, and was appointed provisionally to that rank on the\r\nreturn of the Reliance to Sydney from the South African voyage in that\r\nyear. The prompt confirmation of his promotion by the admiralty he\r\nattributed to the kind interest of Admiral Pasley.\r\n\r\nWhen he quitted his ship at Deptford in October, 1800, he was a man of\r\nmark. His name was honourably known to the elders of his profession,\r\nwhilst he was esteemed by men concerned with geography, navigation, and\r\nkindred branches of study, for the importance of the work he had done,\r\nand for the thorough scientific spirit manifested in it.\r\n\r\nChief among those who recognised his quality was Sir Joseph Banks, the\r\nlearned and wealthy squire who was ever ready to be to zealous men of\r\nscience a friend, a patron, and an influence. Banks was, indeed,\r\nmemorable for the men and work he helped, rather than for his own\r\noriginal contributions to knowledge. During his presidency of the Royal\r\nSociety, from 1777 to 1820--a long time for one man to occupy the\r\nprincipal place in the most distinguished learned body in the world--he\r\nnot only encouraged, but promoted and directed, a remarkable radiation of\r\nresearch work, and was the accessible friend of every man of ability\r\nconcerned in extending the bounds of enquiry into phenomena.\r\n\r\nBanks took a special interest in the young navigator, who was a native of\r\nhis own bit of England, Lincolnshire. He knew well what a large field for\r\ngeographical investigation there was in Australia, and recognised that\r\nFlinders was the right man to do the work. Banks had always foreseen the\r\nimmense possibilities of the country; he was the means of sending out the\r\nnaturalists George Caley, Robert Brown, and Allan Cunningham, to study\r\nits natural products. That he was quick to recognise the sterling\r\ncapacity of Matthew Flinders constitutes his principal claim to our\r\nimmediate attention. The spirit of our age is rather out of sympathy with\r\nthe attitude of patronage, which, as must be confessed, it gratified\r\nBanks to assume; but at all events it was, in this instance, patronage of\r\nthe only tolerable sort, that which helps an able man to fulfil himself\r\nand serve his kind.\r\n\r\nBefore he went to sea again, Flinders was married (April 1801) to Miss\r\nAnn Chappell, stepdaughter of the Rev. William Tyler, rector of\r\nBrothertoft, near Boston. She was a sailor's daughter, her own father\r\nhaving died while in command of a ship out of Hull, engaged in the Baltic\r\ntrade. It is probable that there was an attachment between the pair\r\nbefore Flinders left England in 1794; for during the Norfolk expedition\r\nin 1798 he had named a smooth round hill in Kent's group Mount Chappell,\r\nand had called a small cluster of islands the Chappell Isles. He does not\r\ntell us why they were so named, as was his usual practice. He merely\r\nspeaks of them as \"this small group to which the name of Chappell Isles\r\nis affixed in the chart.\" But a tender little touch of sentiment may\r\ncreep in, even in the making of charts; and we cannot have or wish to\r\nhave, any doubt as to the reason in this case.\r\n\r\nIn his Observations, published in the year of his marriage, Flinders\r\nremarks (page 24) that the hill \"had received the name of Mount Chappell\r\nin February, 1798, and the name is since extended to the isles which lie\r\nin its immediate neighbourhood.\" The fact that the name was given in\r\n1798, indicates that a kindly feeling, to say the least of it, was\r\nentertained for Miss Chappell before Flinders left England in 1795. The\r\nlover in As You Like It carved his lady's name on trees:\r\n\r\n\"O Rosalind, these trees shall be my books,\r\nAnd in their barks my thoughts I'll character.\"\r\n\r\nHere we find our young navigator writing his lady's name on the map. It\r\nis rather an uncommon symptom of a very common complaint.\r\n\r\nMiss Chappell and her sister, the sisters of Flinders, and the young\r\nladies of the Franklin family, were a group of affectionate friends who\r\nlived in the same neighbourhood, and were constantly together. The boys\r\nof the families were brothers to all the girls, who were all sisters to\r\nthem. Matthew on the Reliance wrote to them letters intended to be read\r\nby all, addressing them as \"my charming sisters.\" In one of these\r\nepistles he told the girls: \"never will there be a more happy soul than\r\nwhen I return. O, may the Almighty spare me all those dear friends\r\nwithout whom my joy would be turned into sorrow and mourning.\" But that\r\nhe nourished the recollection of Ann Chappell in his heart with especial\r\nwarmth is apparent from a letter he wrote to her very shortly after the\r\nReliance returned to England (September 25th, 1800):* (* Flinders'\r\nPapers.) \"You are one of those friends,\" he assured her, \"whom I consider\r\nit indispensably necessary to see. I should be glad to have some little\r\naccount of your movements, where you reside, and with whom, that my\r\nmotions may be regulated accordingly...You see that I make everything\r\nsubservient to business. Indeed, my dearest friend, this time seems to be\r\na very critical period of my life. I have long been absent--have done\r\nservices abroad that were not expected, but which seem to be thought a\r\ngood deal of. I have more and greater friends than before, and this seems\r\nto be the moment that their exertions may be most serviceable to me. I\r\nmay now perhaps make a bold dash forward, or may remain a poor lieutenant\r\nall my life.\" And he ended this letter, which Miss Chappell would not\r\nfail to read \"between the lines,\" by assuring \"my dear friend Annette,\"\r\nthat \"with the greatest sincerity, I am her most affectionate friend and\r\nbrother, Matthew Flinders.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this point the comforting understanding between the two young people\r\ndeveloped in ways as to which there is no evidence in correspondence; but\r\nshortly after Flinders received promotion he must have proposed marriage.\r\nHe wrote a short time afterwards in these terms:\r\n\r\n\"H.M.S. Investigator, at the Nore, April 6, 1801.\r\n\r\n\"My dearest friend,\r\n\r\n\"Thou hast asked me if there is a POSSIBILITY of our living together. I\r\nthink I see a PROBABILITY of living with a moderate share of comfort.\r\nTill now I was not certain of being able to fit myself out clear of the\r\nworld. I have now done it, and have accommodation on board the\r\nInvestigator, in which as my wife a woman may, with love to assist her,\r\nmake herself happy. This prospect has recalled all the tenderness which I\r\nhave so sedulously endeavoured to banish. I am sent for to London, where\r\nI shall be from the 9th to the 19th, or perhaps longer. If thou wilt meet\r\nme there, this hand shall be thine for ever. If thou hast sufficient love\r\nand courage, say to Mr. and Mrs. Tyler* (* Her mother and stepfather.)\r\nthat I require nothing more with thee than a sufficient stock of clothes\r\nand a small sum to answer the increased expenses that will necessarily\r\nand immediately come upon me; as well for living on board as providing\r\nfor it at Port Jackson; for whilst I am employed in the most dangerous\r\npart of my duty, thou shalt be placed under some friendly roof there. I\r\nneed not, nor at this time have I time to enter into a detail of my\r\nincome and prospects. It will, I trust, be sufficient for me to say that\r\nI see a fortune growing under me to meet increasing expenses. I only want\r\na fair start, and my life for it, we will do well and be happy. I will\r\nwrite further to-morrow, but shall most anxiously expect thy answer at 86\r\nFleet Street, London, on my visit on Friday; and, I trust, thy presence\r\nimmediately afterwards. I have only time to add that most anxiously I am,\r\nMost sincerely thine,\r\n\r\nMATTHEW FLINDERS.\"\r\n\r\nHe appended a postscript which covertly alludes to the manner in which\r\nSir Joseph Banks might be expected to regard the marriage on the eve of\r\ncommencing the new voyage: \"It will be much better to keep this matter\r\nentirely secret. There are many reasons for it yet, and I have also a\r\npowerful one: I do not know how my great friends might like it.\"\r\n\r\nBut, taking all the risks in this direction, he snatched the first\r\nopportunity that presented itself to hurry down to Lincolnshire, get\r\nmarried, and bring his bride up to London, stuffing into his boot, for\r\nsafe keeping, a roll of bank notes given to him by Mr. Tyler at the\r\nmoment of farewell.\r\n\r\nIn a letter* to his cousin Henrietta, (* Flinders' Papers.) he relates\r\nhow hurriedly the knot matrimonial was at length tied, on the 17th of\r\nApril:\r\n\r\n\"Everything was agreed to in a very handsome manner, and just at this\r\ntime I was called up to town and found that I might be spared a few days\r\nfrom thence. I set off on Wednesday evening from town, arrived next\r\nevening at Spilsby, was married next morning,* which was Friday; on\r\nSaturday we went to Donington, on Sunday reached Huntingdon, and on\r\nMonday were in town. Next morning I presented myself before Sir Joseph\r\nBanks with a grave face as if nothing had happened, and then went on with\r\nmy business as usual. We stayed in town till the following Sunday, and\r\ncame on board the Investigator next day, and here we have remained ever\r\nsince, a few weeks on shore and a day spent on the Essex side of the\r\nThames excepted.\" (* Captain F.J. Bayldon, of the Nautical Academy,\r\nSydney, tells me an interesting story about the Flinders-Chappell\r\nmarriage registration. His father was rector of Partney, Lincolnshire, a\r\nvillage lying two or three miles from Spilsby. When the Captain and his\r\nbrothers were boys, they found in the rectory a large book, such as was\r\nused for parish registers. It was apparently unused. They asked their\r\nfather if they might have the blank pages for drawing paper, and he gave\r\nthem permission. But they found upon a single page, a few marriage\r\nentries, and one of these was the marriage of Matthew Flinders to Ann\r\nChappell. Captain Bayldon, a student of navigation then as he has been\r\never since, knew Flinders' name at once, and took the book to his father.\r\nThe marriage was celebrated at Partney, where the Tylers lived.)\r\n\r\nIn a letter* written on the day of the marriage to Elizabeth Flinders the\r\nbride's fluttered and mixed emotions were apparent. (* Mitchell Library\r\nmanuscripts.) At this time she believed that she was to make the voyage\r\nto Australia in the Investigator with her husband, and hardly knew\r\nwhether the happiness of her new condition or the regretful prospect of a\r\nlong farewell to her circle of friends prevailed most in her heart.\r\n\r\n\"April 17th, 1801.\r\n\r\n\"My beloved Betsy,\r\n\r\n\"Thou wilt be much surprised to hear of this sudden affair; indeed I\r\nscarce believe it myself, tho' I have this very morning given my hand at\r\nthe altar to him I have ever highly esteemed, and it affords me no small\r\npleasure that I am now a part, tho' a distant one, of thy family, my\r\nBetsy. It grieves me much thou art so distant from me. Thy society would\r\nhave greatly cheered me. Thou wilt to-day pardon me if I say but little.\r\nI am scarce able to coin one sentence or to write intelligibly. It pains\r\nme to agony when I indulge the thought for a moment that I must leave all\r\nI value on earth, save one, alas, perhaps for ever. Ah, my Betsy, but I\r\ndare not, must not, think [that]. Therefore, farewell, farewell. May the\r\ngreat God of Heaven preserve thee and those thou lovest, oh,\r\neverlastingly. Adieu, dear darling girl; love as ever, though absent and\r\nfar removed from your poor\r\n\r\nANNETTE.\"\r\n\r\nWe are afforded a confidential insight into Mrs. Flinders' opinion of her\r\nhusband in a letter from her to another girl friend. It was written after\r\nthe marriage, and when Matthew was again at sea, prosecuting that voyage\r\nfrom which he was not to return for over nine years. \"I don't admire want\r\nof firmness in a man. I love COURAGE and DETERMINATION in the male\r\ncharacter. Forgive me, dear Fanny, but INSIPIDS I never did like, and\r\nhaving not long ago tasted such delightful society I have now a greater\r\ncontempt than in former days for that cast of character.\" An \"insipid\"\r\nAnn Chappell certainly had not married, and she found in Matthew Flinders\r\nno lack of the courage and determination she admired.\r\n\r\nA second marriage contracted by the elder Matthew Flinders, connecting\r\nhis family with the Franklins, had an important influence upon the life\r\nof another young sailor who had commenced his career in the Navy in the\r\nprevious year. The Franklin family, which sprang from the village of\r\nSibsey (about six miles north-east of Boston), was now resident at\r\nSpilsby. At the time of the Flinders-Chappell wedding, young John\r\nFranklin was serving on the Polyphemus, and had only a few days\r\npreviously (April 1) taken part in the battle of Copenhagen. In the\r\nordinary course of things he would, there can hardly be a doubt, have\r\nfollowed his profession along normal lines. His virile intellect and\r\nresourceful courage would probably have won him eminence, but it is not\r\nlikely that he would have entered upon that career of exploration which\r\nshed so much lustre on his name, and in the end found him a grave beneath\r\nthe immemorial snows of the frozen north. It was by Flinders that young\r\nFranklin was diverted into the glorious path of discovery; from Flinders\r\nthat he learnt the strictly scientific part of navigation. \"It is very\r\nreasonable for us to infer,\" writes one of Franklin's biographers* (*\r\nAdmiral Markham, Life of Sir John Franklin page 43.) \"that it was in all\r\nprobability in exploring miles of practically unknown coastline, and in\r\nsurveying hitherto undiscovered bays, reefs, and islands in the southern\r\nhemisphere, that John Franklin's mind became imbued with that ardent love\r\nof geographical research which formed such a marked and prominent feature\r\nin his future professional career. Flinders was the example, and\r\nAustralian exploration was the school, that created one of our greatest\r\nArctic navigators and one of the most eminent geographers of his day.\"\r\n\r\nAnother matter with which Flinders was occupied during his stay in\r\nEngland was the preparation of a small publication dealing with his\r\nrecent researches. It was entitled \"Observations on the coasts of Van\r\nDiemen's Land, on Bass's Strait and its Islands, and on parts of the\r\ncoasts of New South Wales, intended to accompany the charts of the late\r\ndiscoveries in those countries, by Matthew Flinders, second lieutenant of\r\nHis Majesty's ship Reliance.\" It consisted of thirty-five quarto pages,\r\nissued without a wrapper, and stitched like a large pamphlet. John\r\nNichols, of Soho, was the publisher, but some copies were issued with the\r\nimprint of Arrowsmith, the publisher of charts. Very few copies now\r\nremain, and the little book, which is one of the rare things of\r\nbibliography, is not to be found even in many important libraries.\r\n\r\nFlinders dedicated the issue to Sir Joseph Banks. \"Your zealous exertions\r\nto promote geographical and nautical knowledge, your encouragement of men\r\nemployed in the cultivation of the sciences that tend to this\r\nimprovement, and the countenance you have been pleased to show me in\r\nparticular, embolden me to lay the following observations before you.\"\r\nGenerally speaking, the Observations contain matter that was afterwards\r\nembodied in the larger Voyage to Terra Australis, and taken from reports\r\nthat have been used in the preceding pages. The special purpose of the\r\nbook was to be of use to navigators who might sail in Australian waters,\r\nand it is therefore full of particulars likely to guide them. He pointed\r\nout that there might be some errors in the longitude records of the\r\nNorfolk voyage because \"no time-keepers could be procured for this\r\nexpedition,\" but he pointed out that the survey was made with great care.\r\n\"The sloop was kept close to the shore, and brought back every morning\r\nwithin sight of the same point it had been hauled off during the\r\npreceding evening, by which means the chain of angles was never broken.\"\r\nThis was, as will be seen later, the method employed on the more\r\nimportant voyage about to be undertaken.\r\n\r\nThe task that mainly occupied his attention during these few months in\r\nEngland, was the making of preparations for a voyage of discovery\r\nintended to complete the exploration of the coasts of Australia. It has\r\nalready been remarked that the initiative in regard to the Francis and\r\nNorfolk explorations sprang from Flinders' own eager desire, and not from\r\nthe governing authorities. Precisely the same occurred in the case of the\r\nfar more important Investigator voyage. He did not wait for something to\r\nturn up. Immediately after his arrival in England, he formulated a plan,\r\npointed out the sphere of investigation to which attention ought to be\r\ndirected, and approached the proper authorities. He wrote to Sir Joseph\r\nBanks, \"offering my services to explore minutely the whole of the coasts,\r\nas well those which were imperfectly known as those entirely unknown,\r\nprovided the Government would provide me with a proper ship for the\r\npurpose. I did not address myself in vain to this zealous promoter of\r\nscience; and Earl Spencer, then First Lord of the Admiralty, entering\r\nwarmly into the views of his friend, obtained the approbation of his\r\nMajesty, and immediately set out a ship that could be spared from the\r\npresent demands of war, which Great Britain then waged with most of the\r\nPowers of Europe.\"* (* Flinders' Papers.)\r\n\r\nLord Spencer's prompt and warm acquiescence in the proposition is not\r\nless to be noted than the friendly interest of Banks. His administration\r\nof the Admiralty in Pitt's Government was distinguished by his selection\r\nof Nelson as the admiral to frustrate the schemes of the French in sea\r\nwarfare; and it stands as an additional tribute to his sagacity that he\r\nat once recognised Flinders to be the right man to maintain the prowess\r\nof British seamanship in discovery.\r\n\r\nThree reasons made the Government the more disposed to equip an\r\nexpedition for the purpose. The first was that in June, 1800, L.G. Otto,\r\nthe representative of the French Republic in London, applied for a\r\npassport for two discovery ships which were being despatched to the south\r\nseas. French men of science had for many years interested themselves in\r\nthe investigation of these unknown portions of the globe. The expeditions\r\nof Laperouse (1785 to 1788) and of Dentrecasteaux (1791 to 1796) were\r\nevidence of their concern with the problems awaiting elucidation. The\r\nprofessors of the Museum in Paris were eager that collections of minerals\r\nand plants should be made in the southern hemisphere. The Institute of\r\nFrance was led by keen men of science, one of whom, the Comte de\r\nFleurieu, had prepared the instructions for the two previous voyages.\r\nThey had found a warm friend to research in Louis XVI, and the fall of\r\nthe monarchy did not diminish their anxiety that France should win honour\r\nfrom pursuing the enquiry. They represented to Napoleon, then First\r\nConsul, the utility of undertaking another voyage, and his authorisation\r\nwas secured in May. A passport was granted by Earl Spencer when Otto made\r\nthe application, but there was a suspicion that the French Government was\r\ninfluenced by motives of policy lying deeper than the ostensible desire\r\nto promote discovery.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the East India Company was concerned lest the French should\r\nestablish themselves somewhere on the coast of Australia, and, with a\r\nbase of operations there, menace the Company's trade.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Sir Joseph Banks, after conversations with Flinders and an\r\nexamination of his charts, saw the importance of the work remaining to be\r\ndone, and used his influence with the Admiralty to authorise a ship to be\r\ndetailed for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThus imperial policy, trade interests and scientific ardour combined to\r\nprocure the equipment of a new research expedition. In view of the fact\r\nthat the Admiralty became officially aware in June of the intentions of\r\nthe French, it cannot be said that they were precipitate in making their\r\nown plans; for it was not until December 12 that they issued their\r\norders.\r\n\r\nThe vessel allotted for the employment was a 334-ton sloop, built in the\r\nnorth of England for the merchant service. She had been purchased by the\r\nGovernment for naval work, and, under the name of the Xenophon, had been\r\nemployed in convoying merchant vessels in the Channel. Her name was\r\nchanged to the Investigator, her bottom was re-coppered, the plating\r\nbeing put on \"two streaks higher than before,\" and she was equipped for a\r\nthree years' voyage. Flinders took command of her at Sheerness on January\r\n25th, 1801. He was promoted to the rank of commander on the 16th of the\r\nfollowing month.\r\n\r\nThe renovated ship was good enough to look at, and she commended herself\r\nto Flinders' eye as being the sort of vessel best fitted for the work in\r\ncontemplation. In form she \"nearly resembled the description of vessel\r\nrecommended by Captain Cook as best calculated for voyages of discovery.\"\r\nBut, though comfortable, she was old and unsound. Patching and caulking\r\nmerely plugged up defects which the buffetings of rough seas soon\r\nrevealed. But she was the best ship the Admiralty was able to spare at\r\nthe time. Long before she had completed her outward voyage, however, the\r\nsenility of the Investigator had made itself uncomfortably evident.\r\nWriting of the leaks experienced on the run down to the Cape, Flinders\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"The leakiness of the ship increased with the continuance of the\r\nsouthwest winds, and at the end of a week amounted to five inches of\r\nwater an hour. It seemed, however, that the leaks were above the water's\r\nedge, for on tacking to the westward they were diminished to two inches.\r\nThis working of the oakum out of the seams indicated a degree of weakness\r\nwhich, in a ship destined to encounter every hazard, could not be\r\ncontemplated without uneasiness. The very large ports, formerly cut in\r\nthe sides to receive thirty-two pound carronades, joined to what I have\r\nbeen able to collect from the dockyard officers, had given me an\r\nunfavourable opinion of her strength; and this was now but too much\r\nconfirmed. Should it be asked why representations were not made and a\r\nstronger vessel procured, I answer that the exigencies of the navy were\r\nsuch at that time, that I was given to understand no better ship could be\r\nspared from the service; and my anxiety to complete the investigation of\r\nthe coasts of Terra Australis did not admit of refusing the one offered.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of maritime discovery is strewn with rotten ships. Certainly\r\nif the great navigators, before venturing to face the unknown, had waited\r\nto be provided with vessels fit to make long voyages, the progress of\r\nresearch would have been much slower than was the case. It sounds like\r\nhyperbole to say that, when pitch and planks failed, these gallant seamen\r\nstopped their leaks with hope and ardour; but really, something like that\r\nis pretty near the truth.\r\n\r\nThe fitting out of the Investigator proceeded busily during January and\r\nFebruary, 1801. The Admiralty was liberal in its allowances. Indeed, the\r\nequipment was left almost entirely to Banks and Flinders. The commander\r\n\"obtained permission to fit her out as I should judge necessary, without\r\nreference to the supplies usually allotted to vessels of the same class.\"\r\nThe extent to which the Admiralty was guided by Banks is indicated in a\r\nmemorandum by the Secretary, Evan Nepean, penned in April. Banks wrote\r\n\"Is my proposal for an alteration in the undertaking in the Investigator\r\napproved?\" Nepean replied \"Any proposal you may make will be approved;\r\nthe whole is left entirely to your decision.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to plentiful supplies and special provision for a large store\r\nof water, the Investigator carried an interesting assortment of \"gauds,\r\nnick-nacks, trifles,\" to serve as presents to native peoples with whom it\r\nwas desired to cultivate friendly relations. The list included useful\r\narticles as well as glittering toys, and is a curious document as\r\nillustrating a means by which civilisation sought to tickle the barbarian\r\ninto complaisance. Flinders carried for this purpose 500 pocket-knives,\r\n500 looking-glasses, 100 combs, 200 strings of blue, red, white and\r\nyellow beads, 100 pairs of ear-rings, 200 finger rings, 1000 yards of\r\nblue and red gartering, 100 red caps, 100 small blankets, 100 yards of\r\nthin red baize, 100 yards of coloured linen, 1000 needles, five pounds of\r\nred thread, 200 files, 100 shoemakers' knives, 300 pairs of scissors, 100\r\nhammers, 50 axes, 300 hatchets, a quantity of other samples of\r\nironmongery, a number of medals with King George's head imprinted upon\r\nthem, and some new copper coins.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious assortment, but it may be observed that the materials, as\r\nwell as the method of ingratiation, were very much the same with the\r\nearlier as with the later navigators. An early instance occurs in Rene\r\nLaudonniere's account of his relations with the natives of Florida in\r\n1565:* (* Hakluyt's Voyages edition of 1904 Volume 9 pages 31 and 49.) \"I\r\ngave them certaine small trifles, which were little knives or tablets of\r\nglasse, wherein the image of King Charles the Ninth was drawen very\r\nlively...I recompensed them with certaine hatchets, knives, beades of\r\nglasse, combes and looking-glasses.\"\r\n\r\nThe crew of the Investigator was selected with particular care. Flinders\r\ndesired to carry none but young sailors of good character. He was given\r\npermission to take men from the Zealand, and he explained to those who\r\nvolunteered the nature of the service, and its probably severe and\r\nprotracted character. The readiness with which men came forward gave him\r\nmuch pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Upon one occasion, when eleven volunteers were to be received from the\r\nZealand, a strong instance was given of the spirit of enterprise\r\nprevalent amongst British seamen. About three hundred disposable men were\r\ncalled up, and placed on one part of the deck; and after the nature of\r\nthe voyage, with the number of men wanted, had been explained to them,\r\nthose who volunteered were desired to go over to the opposite side. The\r\ncandidates were no less than two hundred and fifty, most of whom sought\r\nwith eagerness to be received; and the eleven who were chosen proved,\r\nwith one single exception, to be worthy of the preference they obtained.\"\r\n\r\nOf the whole crew (and the total ship's company numbered 83) only two\r\ncaused any trouble to the commander. As these two \"required more severity\r\nin reducing to good order than I wished to exercise in a service of this\r\nnature,\" when the Investigator reached the Cape, Flinders arranged with\r\nthe Admiral there, Sir Roger Curtis, to exchange them--as well as two\r\nothers who from lack of sufficient strength were not suitable--for four\r\nsailors upon the flagship, who made a pressing application to go upon a\r\nvoyage of discovery. Thus purged of a very few refractories and\r\ninefficients, the ship's company was a happy, loyal and healthy crew, of\r\nwhom the commander was justifiably proud.\r\n\r\nThe officers and scientific staff were chosen with a view to making the\r\nvoyage fruitful in utility. The first lieutenant, Robert Fowler, had\r\nserved on the ship when she was the Xenophon. He was a Lincolnshire man,\r\nhailing from Horncastle, and had been a schoolfellow of Banks. But it was\r\nnot through Sir Joseph's influence that he was selected. Flinders made\r\nhis acquaintance while the refitting of the vessel was in progress, and\r\nfound him desirous of making the voyage. As his former captain spoke well\r\nof him, his services were accepted. Samuel Ward Flinders went as second\r\nlieutenant, and there were six midshipmen, of whom John Franklin was one.\r\n\r\nOriginally it was intended that Mungo Park, the celebrated African\r\ntraveller, who was at this time in England looking round for employment,\r\nshould go to Australia on the Investigator, and act as naturalist. But no\r\ndefinite engagement was entered into; the post remained vacant, and a\r\nPortuguese exile living in London, Correa de Sena, introduced to Banks a\r\nyoung Scottish botanist who desired to go, describing him as one \"fitted\r\nto pursue an object with a staunch and a cold mind.\" Robert Brown was\r\nthen not quite twenty-seven years of age. Like the gusty swashbuckler,\r\nDugald Dalgetty, he had been educated at the Marischal College, Aberdeen.\r\nFor a few years he served as ensign and assistant surgeon of a Scottish\r\nregiment, the Fife Fencibles. Always a keen botanist, he found a ready\r\nfriend in Banks, who promised to recommend him \"for the purpose of\r\nexploring the natural history, amongst other things.\" His salary was 420\r\npounds a year, and he earned it by admirable service. Brown remained in\r\nAustralia for two years after the discovery voyage, and his great\r\nProdromus Florae Novae Hollandiae, which won the praise of Humboldt, is a\r\nclassic monument to the extent and value of his researches.\r\n\r\nWilliam Westall was appointed landscape and figure draftsman to the\r\nexpedition at a salary of 315 pounds per annum. The nine fine engravings\r\nwhich adorn the Voyage to Terra Australis are his work. He was but a\r\nyouth of nineteen when he made this voyage. Afterwards he attained repute\r\nas a landscape painter, and was elected as Associate of the Royal\r\nAcademy. One hundred and thirty-eight of his drawings made on the\r\nInvestigator are preserved.\r\n\r\nFerdinand Bauer was appointed botanical draftsman to the expedition at a\r\nsalary of 315 pounds. He was an Austrian, forty years of age, an\r\nenthusiast in his work, and a man of uncommon industry. He made 1600\r\nbotanical drawings which, in Robert Brown's opinion, were \"for beauty,\r\naccuracy and completion of detail unequalled in this or in any other\r\ncountry in Europe.\" Bauer's Illustrationes Florae Novae Hollandiae,\r\npublished in 1814, consisted of plates which were drawn, engraved and\r\ncoloured by his own hand. Flinders formed a very high opinion of the\r\ncapacity of both Brown and Bauer. \"It is fortunate for science,\" he wrote\r\nto Banks \"that two men of such assiduity and abilities have been\r\nselected; their application is beyond what I have been accustomed to\r\nsee.\"\r\n\r\nPeter Good, appointed gardener to the expedition at a salary of 105\r\npounds, was a foreman at the Kew Gardens when he was selected for this\r\nservice. Brown found him a valuable assistant, and an indefatigable\r\nworker. He died in Sydney in June, 1803, from dysentery contracted at\r\nTimor. Of John Allen, engaged as a miner at a salary of 105 pounds,\r\nnothing is known.\r\n\r\nJohn Crossley was engaged to sail as astronomer, at a salary of 420\r\npounds, but he did not accompany the Investigator further than the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, where his health broke down, and he returned to England.\r\nThe instruments with which he had been furnished by the Board of\r\nLongitude were, however, left on board, and Flinders undertook to do his\r\nwork in cooperation with his brother Samuel, who had been assisting\r\nCrossley, and was able to take charge of the astronomical clocks and\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nThe interest taken by the East India Company's Court of Directors in the\r\nexpedition was manifested in their vote of 600 pounds for the table money\r\nof the officers and staff.* (* The East India Company, through its Court\r\nof Directors, actually voted 1200 pounds in May, 1801; but only 600\r\npounds of this sum was paid at the commencement of the voyage. The\r\nremainder was to be paid to the commander and officers as a reward if\r\nthey successfully accomplished their task. Flinders' manuscript\r\nletter-book contains a copy of a letter dated November 14, 1810, wherein\r\nhe reminds the Company of their promise. I have found no record of the\r\npayment of the remaining 600 pounds, but Flinders' Journal shows him to\r\nhave dined with the directors a few weeks after the letter was sent, and\r\na little later the Journal contains a record of a merry evening spent\r\ntogether by Flinders and a party of his old Investigator shipmates. It is\r\na fair assumption that the money was divided up on that occasion.) They\r\ngave this sum \"from the voyage being within the limits of the Company's\r\ncharter, from the expectation of the examinations and discoveries proving\r\nadvantageous, and partly, as they said\"--so Flinders modestly\r\nobserved--\"for my former services.\" The Company's charter gave to it a\r\ncomplete monopoly of trade with the east and the Pacific, and it was\r\ntherefore interested in the finding of fresh harbours for its vessels in\r\nthe South Seas. But, despite this display of concern, the East India\r\nCompany had been no friend to Australian discovery and colonization. In\r\nthe early years of the settlement at Port Jackson, it resisted the\r\nopening of direct trade between Great Britain and New South Wales, with\r\nas jealous a dislike as ever the Spanish monopolists at Seville displayed\r\nin the sixteenth century concerning all trade with America that did not\r\nflow through their hands. Even so recently as 1806 the Company\r\nopposed--and, strangely enough, successfully--the sale of a cargo of\r\nsealskins and whale oil from Sydney, on the ground \"that the charter of\r\nthe colony gave the colonists no right to trade, and that the transaction\r\nwas a violation of Company's charter and against its welfare.\" The grant\r\nto Flinders was not, therefore, a manifestation of zeal for Australian\r\ndevelopment, except in the matter of finding harbours, and except, also,\r\nthat there was an uneasy feeling that the French would be mischievously\r\nbusy on the north coast. \"I hope the French ships of discovery will not\r\nstation themselves on the north-west coast of Australia,\" wrote C.F.\r\nGreville, one of the Company's directors.\r\n\r\nThe instructions furnished to Flinders prescribed the course of the\r\nvoyage very strictly. They were that he should first run down the coast\r\nfrom 130 degrees of east longitude (that is, from about the head of the\r\nGreat Australian Bight) to Bass Strait, and endeavour to discover such\r\nharbours as there might be. Then, proceeding through the Strait, he was\r\nto call at Sydney to refresh his company and refit the ship. After that\r\nhe was to return along the coast and diligently examine it as far as King\r\nGeorge's Sound. As the sailing was delayed till the middle of July,\r\nFlinders expressed a wish that he should not be ordered to return to the\r\nsouth coast from Port Jackson. \"If my orders do not forbid it, I shall\r\nexamine the south coast more minutely in my first run along it, and if\r\nanything material should present itself, as a strait, gulf, or very large\r\nriver, shall take as much time in its examination as the remaining part\r\nof the summer shall then consist of; for I consider it very material to\r\nthe success of the voyage and to its early completion that we should be\r\nupon the northern coasts in winter and the southern ones in summer.\"\r\n\r\nThis was written to Banks, who, as we have seen, could probably have\r\nsecured an alteration of the official instructions had he desired to do\r\nso. But they were not modified; and about a fortnight later (July 17)\r\nFlinders wrote: \"The Admiralty have not thought good to permit me to\r\ncircumnavigate New Holland in the way that appears to me (underlined)\r\nbest suited to expedition and safety.\" It is probable that, if Banks\r\ndiscussed the proposed alteration with the Admiralty, the more rapid run\r\nalong the south coast was insisted upon, because that was the field to\r\nwhich the French expedition might be expected to apply itself with most\r\ndiligence; as, in fact, was actually the case. Governor King had also\r\nwritten to Banks pointing out the importance of a southern survey, \"to\r\nsee what shelter it affords in case a ship should be taken before she can\r\nclear the land to the southward and the western entrance to the Strait.\"\r\n\r\nThe instructions continued that after the exploration of the south of New\r\nHolland, the Investigator was to sail to the north-west and examine the\r\nGulf of Carpentaria, carefully investigating Torres Strait and the whole\r\nof the remainder of the north-west and north-east coasts. After that, the\r\neast coast was to be more fully explored; and when the whole programme\r\nwas finished Flinders was to return to England for further instructions.\r\n\r\nThe functions of the \"scientific gentlemen\" were carefully defined.\r\nFlinders was directed to afford facilities for the naturalists to collect\r\nspecimens and the artists to make drawings. The hand of Banks is apparent\r\nin the nice balancing of liberty of independent study with liability to\r\ndirection from the commander; and his forethought in these particulars\r\nwas probably inspired by his experience with Cook's expedition many years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nOne other set of instructions from the Admiralty is of great importance\r\nin view of what subsequently occurred, and had a bearing upon the\r\nexpedition as it affected political relations. Great Britain was at war\r\nwith France, and the Investigator, though on a peaceful mission, was a\r\nsloop belonging to the British navy. Flinders wrote to the Admiralty\r\n(July 2) soliciting instructions as to what he was to do in case he met\r\nFrench vessels at sea, \"for without an order to desist, the articles of\r\nwar will oblige me to act inimically to them.\" The directions that he\r\nreceived were explicit. He was to act towards any French ship \"as if the\r\ntwo countries were not at war; and with respect to the ships and vessels\r\nof other powers with which this country is at war, you are to avoid, if\r\npossible, having any communication with them; and not to take letters or\r\npackets other than such as you may receive from this office or the office\r\nof his Majesty's Secretary of State.\" The concluding words of the\r\ninstruction intimately concern the events which, in the next year but\r\none, commenced that long agony of imprisonment which Flinders had to\r\nendure in Ile-de-France.\r\n\r\nHe was also provided with a passport from the French Government, and the\r\nterms in which it was couched are of the utmost importance for the\r\nunderstanding of what followed. It was issued for the Investigator,\r\ncommanded by Captain Matthew Flinders, for a voyage of discovery of which\r\nthe object was to extend human knowledge and promote the progress of\r\nnautical science. It commanded all French officers, at sea or on shore,\r\nnot to interfere with the ship and its officers, but on the contrary to\r\nassist them if they needed help. But this treatment was only to be\r\nextended as long as the Investigator did not announce her intention of\r\ncommitting any act of hostility against the French Republic and her\r\nallies, did not render assistance to her enemies, and did not traffic in\r\nmerchandise or contraband goods. The passport was signed by the French\r\nMinister of Marine and Colonies, Forfait, on behalf of the First Consul.*\r\n(* A transcript of Flinders' own copy of the French passport is now at\r\nCaen, amongst the Decaen Papers Volume 84 page 133.)\r\n\r\nBefore the expedition sailed, Flinders became engaged in a correspondence\r\nwhich must have been embarrassing to him, relating to his wife. He was\r\nmarried, as has been stated, in April, after he had been promoted\r\ncommander, and while the Investigator was lying at Sheerness, awaiting\r\nsailing orders. As the voyage would in all probability extend over\r\nseveral years, his intention was to take his bride with him to Sydney,\r\nand leave her there while he prosecuted his investigations in the south,\r\nnorth and east. He had no reason to think that his doing so would give\r\noffence in official quarters, especially as he was aware of cases where\r\ncommanders of ships had been permitted to take their wives on cruises\r\nwhen their vessels were not protected by passports securing immunity from\r\nattack. There are even instances of wives of British naval officers being\r\non board ship during engagements. During Nelson's attack on Santa Cruz,\r\nin 1797, Captain Fremantle of the Seahorse had with him his wife, whom he\r\nhad lately married. It was in that engagement that Nelson lost an arm;\r\nand when he returned, bleeding and in great pain, he would not go on\r\nboard the Seahorse, saying that he would not have Mrs. Fremantle alarmed\r\nby seeing him in such a condition, without any news of her husband, who\r\nhad accompanied the landing. The amputation of the shattered limb was\r\ntherefore performed on the Theseus.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of permitting a naval officer to take his wife on a long\r\nvoyage in a ship of the navy may well be questioned, and the contrary\r\nrule is now well established. But it was not invariably observed a\r\ncentury or more ago; and that Flinders acted in perfect good faith in the\r\nmatter is evident from the correspondence, which, on so delicate a\r\nsubject, he conducted with a manliness and good taste that display his\r\ncharacter in an amiable light.\r\n\r\nIn all probability Mrs. Flinders would have been allowed to proceed to\r\nPort Jackson unchallenged but for the unlucky circumstance that, when the\r\ncommissioners of the Admiralty paid an official visit of inspection to\r\nthe ship, she was seen \"seated in the captain's cabin without her\r\nbonnet.\"* (* Flinders' Papers.) They considered this to be \"too open a\r\ndeclaration of that being her home.\" Her husband first heard of the\r\nmatter semi-officially from Banks, who wrote on May 21st:--\r\n\r\n\"I have but time to tell you that the news of your marriage, which was\r\npublished in the Lincoln paper, has reached me. The Lords of the\r\nAdmiralty have heard also that Mrs. Flinders is on board the\r\nInvestigator, and that you have some thought of carrying her to sea with\r\nyou. This I was very sorry to hear, and if that is the case I beg to give\r\nyou my advice by no means to adventure to measures so contrary to the\r\nregulations and the discipline of the Navy; for I am convinced by\r\nlanguage I have heard, that their Lordships will, if they hear of her\r\nbeing in New South Wales, immediately order you to be superseded,\r\nwhatever may be the consequences, and in all likelihood order Mr. Grant\r\nto finish the survey.\r\n\r\nTo threaten to supercede Flinders if it were even heard that his wife was\r\nin New South Wales was surely an excess of rigour. His reply was written\r\nfrom the Nore, May 24th, 1801:\r\n\r\n\"I am much indebted to you, Sir Joseph, for the information contained in\r\nyour letter of the 21st. It is true that I had an intention of taking\r\nMrs. Flinders to Port Jackson, to remain there until I should have\r\ncompleted the voyage, and to have then brought her home again in the\r\nship, and I trust that the service would not have suffered in the least\r\nby such a step. The Admiralty have most probably conceived that I\r\nintended to keep her on board during the voyage, but this was far from my\r\nintentions. As some vindication of the step I was about to take, I may be\r\npermitted to observe that until it was intended to apply for a passport,\r\nI not only did not take the step, but did not intend it--which is perhaps\r\na greater attention to that article of the Naval Instructions than many\r\ncommanders have paid to it. If their Lordships understood this matter in\r\nits true light, I should hope that they would have shown the same\r\nindulgence to me as to Lieutenant Kent of the Buffalo, and many others\r\nwho have not had the plea of a passport.\r\n\r\n\"If their Lordships' sentiments should continue the same, whatever may be\r\nmy disappointment, I shall give up the wife for the voyage of discovery;\r\nand I would beg of you, Sir Joseph, to be assured that even this\r\ncircumstance will not damp the ardour I feel to accomplish the important\r\npurpose of the present voyage, and in a way that shall preclude the\r\nnecessity of any one following after me to explore.\r\n\r\n\"It would be too much presumption in me to beg of Sir Joseph Banks to set\r\nthis matter in its proper light, because by your letters I judge it meets\r\nwith your disapprobation entirely; but I hope that this opinion has been\r\nformed upon the idea of Mrs. Flinders continuing on board the ship when\r\nengaged in real service.\"\r\n\r\nBanks promised to lay before the Admiralty the representations made to\r\nhim, but Flinders a few days later (June 3rd) wrote another letter in\r\nwhich he conscientiously expressed his determination not to risk a\r\nmisunderstanding with his superiors by taking his wife:\r\n\r\n\"I feel much obliged by your offer to lay the substance of my letter\r\nbefore the Admiralty, but I foresee that, although I should in the case\r\nof Mrs. Flinders going to Port Jackson have been more particularly\r\ncautious of my stay there, yet their Lordships will conclude naturally\r\nenough that her presence would tend to increase the number of and to\r\nlengthen my visits. I am therefore afraid to risk their Lordships' ill\r\nopinion, and Mrs. Flinders will return to her friends immediately that\r\nour sailing orders arrive.\r\n\r\nIt can well be believed that \"my Lords\" of the Admiralty did not feel\r\nvery considerate towards ladies just at that time; for one of their most\r\nbrilliant officers, Nelson, was, while this very correspondence was\r\ntaking place, gravely compromising himself with Emma Hamilton at Naples.\r\nSt. Vincent and Troubridge, salt-hearted old veterans as they were, were\r\njust the men to be suspicious on the score of petticoats fluttering about\r\nthe decks of the King's ships. It seems that they were inclined unjustly\r\nand ungallantly to frown and cry cherchez la femme about small things\r\nthat went wrong, even when Flinders was in no way to blame for them. They\r\nblamed him for some desertions before properly apprehending the\r\ncircumstances, and when he had merely reported a fact for which he was\r\nnot responsible.\r\n\r\nThe next two letters close the whole incident, which gave more annoyance\r\nto all parties than ought to have been the case in connection with an\r\nofficer so sedulously scrupulous in matters concerning the honour and\r\nefficiency of the service as Flinders was. Banks, in quite a patron's\r\ntone, wrote on June 5th:\r\n\r\n\"I yesterday went to the Admiralty to enquire about the Investigator, and\r\nwas indeed much mortified to learn there that you had been on shore in\r\nHythe Bay, and I was still more mortified to hear that several of your\r\nmen had deserted, and that you had had a prisoner entrusted to your\r\ncharge, who got away at a time when the quarter-deck was in charge of a\r\nmidshipman. I heard with pain many severe remarks on these matters, and\r\nin defence I could only say that as Captain Flinders is a sensible man\r\nand a good seaman, such matters could only be attributed to the laxity of\r\ndiscipline which always takes place when the captain's wife is on board,\r\nand that such lax discipline could never again take place, because you\r\nhad wisely resolved to leave Mrs. Flinders with her relations.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a kindly admonishment from an elderly scholar to a young officer\r\nof twenty-seven only recently married; but to attribute affairs for which\r\nFlinders was not to blame to the presence of his bride, was a little\r\nunamiable. With excellent taste, Flinders, in his answer, avoided keeping\r\nhis wife's name in the controversy, and he disposed of the allegations\r\nboth effectively and judiciously:\r\n\r\n\"My surprise is great that the Admiralty should attach any blame to me\r\nfor the desertion of these men from the Advice brig, which is the next\r\npoint in your letter, Sir Joseph. These men were lent, among others, to\r\nthe brig, by order of Admiral Graeme. From her it was that they absented\r\nthemselves, and I reported it to the Admiralty. I had been so particular\r\nas to send with the men a request to the commanding officer to permit\r\nnone of them to go on shore, but Lieutenant Fowler pointed out to him\r\nsuch of them as might be most depended on to go in boats upon duty.\r\nNothing more could have been done on our part to prevent desertion, and\r\nif blame rests anywhere it must be upon the officers of the Advice. The\r\nthree men were volunteers for this voyage, but having gotten on shore\r\nwith money in their pockets most probably stayed so long that they became\r\nafraid to return.\"\r\n\r\nOn the subject of discipline he said: \"It is only a duty to myself to\r\nassert that the discipline and good order on board the Investigator is\r\nexceeded in very few ships of her size, and is at least twice what it was\r\nunder her former commander. I beg to refer to Lieutenant Fowler on this\r\nsubject, who knows the ship intimately both as the Xenophon and\r\nInvestigator. On the last subject I excuse myself from not having thought\r\nthe occurrence of sufficient consequence to trouble Sir Joseph with, and\r\nit was what I least suspected that my character required a defender, for\r\nit was in my power to have suppressed almost the whole of those things\r\nfor which I am blamed; but I had the good of the service sufficiently at\r\nheart to make the reports which brought them into light. That the\r\nAdmiralty have thrown blame on me, and should have represented to my\r\ngreatest and best friend that I had gotten the ship on shore, had let a\r\nprisoner escape, and three of my men run away, without adding the\r\nattendant circumstances, is most mortifying and grievous to me; but it is\r\nimpossible to express so gratefully as I feel the anxious concern with\r\nwhich you took the part of one who has not the least claim to such\r\ngenerosity.\"\r\n\r\nThe last two paragraphs refer to an incident which will be dealt with\r\npresently.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Investigator was ready to sail in April, 1801, the Admiralty\r\nwithheld orders till the middle of July. Flinders, vexed as he naturally\r\nwas at having to leave his young wife behind, was impatient at the delay\r\nfor two good reasons. First, he was anxious to have the benefit of the\r\nAustralian summer months, between November and February, for the\r\nexploration of the south-west, the winter being the better time for the\r\nnorthern work; and secondly, reports had appeared in the journals about\r\nthe progress of the French expedition, and he did not wish to be\r\nforestalled in the making of probably important discoveries. The \"Annual\r\nRegister\" for 1801, for example (page 33) stated that letters were\r\nreceived from the Isle of France, dated April 29th, stating that Le\r\nNaturaliste and Le Geographe had left that station on their voyage to New\r\nHolland. While \"my Lords\" were warming up imaginary errors in the heat of\r\nan excited imagination on account of poor Mrs. Flinders, the commander of\r\nthe Investigator was losing valuable time. In May he wrote to Sir Joseph\r\nBanks: \"The advanced state of the season makes me excessively anxious to\r\nbe off. I fear that a little longer delay will lose us a summer and\r\nlengthen our voyage at least six months. Besides that, the French are\r\ngaining time upon us.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 26th, the Investigator left the Nore for Spithead to wait further\r\norders. She was provided, by the Admiralty itself, with a chart published\r\nby J.H. Moore, upon which a sandbank known as the Roar, extending from\r\nDungeness towards Folkestone, between 2 1/2 to 4 miles from land, was not\r\nmarked. On the evening of the 28th, in a perfectly calm sea, and at a\r\ntime when, sailing by the chart, there was no reason to apprehend any\r\ndanger, the ship glided on to the bank. She did not suffer a particle of\r\ninjury, and in a very short time had resumed her voyage. If Flinders had\r\nsaid nothing at all about the incident, nobody off the ship would have\r\nbeen any the wiser. But as the Admiralty had furnished him with a\r\ndefective chart, and might do the same to other commanders, who might\r\nstrike the sand in more inimical circumstances, he considered it to be\r\nhis duty to the service to report the matter; when lo! the Admiralty,\r\ninstead of censuring its officials for supplying the Investigator with a\r\nfaulty chart, gravely shook its head, and made those \"severe remarks\"\r\nabout Flinders, which induced Sir Joseph Banks to admonish him so\r\npaternally in the letter already quoted. The Investigator had, it seemed\r\nto be the opinion of their Lordships, struck the sand, not because it was\r\nuncharted, but because Mrs. Flinders was on board between the Nore and\r\nSpithead! Flinders' letter to Banks, June 6th, stated his position quite\r\nconclusively:\r\n\r\n\"Finding so material a thing as a sandbank three or four miles from the\r\nshore unlaid down in the chart, I thought it a duty incumbent upon me to\r\nendeavour to prevent the like accident from happening to others, by\r\nstating the circumstances to the Admiralty, and giving the most exact\r\nbearings from the shoal that our situation would enable me to take, with\r\nthe supposed distance from the land. It would have been very easy for me\r\nto have suppressed every part of the circumstance, and thus to have\r\nescaped the blame which seems to attach to me, instead of some share of\r\npraise for my good intentions. I hope that it will not be thought\r\npresumptuous in me to say that no blame ought to be attributed to\r\nme...The Admiralty do not seem to take much into consideration that I had\r\nno master appointed, who ought to be the pilot, or that having been\r\nconstantly employed myself in foreign voyages I cannot consequently have\r\nmuch personal knowledge of the Channel. In truth, I had nothing but the\r\nchart and my own general observations to direct me; and had the former\r\nbeen at all correct we should have arrived here as safe as if we had any\r\nnumber of pilots.\"\r\n\r\nIt is significant of Flinders' truth-telling habit of mind that when he\r\ncame to write the history of the voyage, published thirteen years later,\r\nhe did not pass over the incident at the Roar, though he can hardly have\r\nremembered as agreeable an event for which he was blamed when he was not\r\nwrong. But perhaps he found satisfaction in being able to write that the\r\ncircumstance \"showed the necessity there was for a regulation, since\r\nadopted, to furnish His Majesty's ships with correct charts.\" A natural\r\ncomment is that it is odd that so obviously sensible a thing was not done\r\nuntil an accident showed the danger of not doing it. The blame\r\ntemporarily put upon Flinders did no harm to his credit, and was probably\r\nmerely an oblique form of self-reproach on the part of the Admiralty.\r\n\r\nThe Investigator arrived at Spithead on June 2nd, but did not receive\r\nfinal sailing orders till more than another month had elapsed. \"I put an\r\nend, I hope, to our correspondence for some months, concluding that you\r\nwill sail immediately,\" wrote Sir Joseph Banks in June, \"and with sincere\r\ngood wishes for your future prosperity, and with a firm belief that you\r\nwill, in your future conduct, do credit to yourself as an able\r\ninvestigator, and to me as having recommended you.\" The true spirit of\r\nfriendship breathes in those words, the friendship, too, of a discerning\r\njudge of character for a younger man whom he respected and trusted. The\r\ntrust was nobly justified. Flinders undertook the work with the firm\r\ndetermination to do his work thoroughly. \"My greatest ambition,\" he had\r\nwritten some weeks previously (April 29),\"is to make such a minute\r\ninvestigation of this extensive and very interesting country that no\r\nperson shall have occasion to come after me to make further discoveries.\"\r\nIt was with that downright resolve that Flinders set out, and in that\r\nspirit did he pursue his task to its end. It was not for nothing that\r\nthis man was the nautical grandson of Cook.\r\n\r\nSailing orders arrived from London on July 17th, and on the following day\r\nthe Investigator sailed from Spithead. Mrs. Flinders was at this time\r\nresiding with her friends in Lincolnshire. She had been ill from fretful\r\ndisappointment when forbidden to sail with her husband, but had recovered\r\nbefore they parted. Many a weary, bitter year was to pass before she\r\nwould see him again; years of notable things done, and of cruel wrongs\r\nendured; and then they were only to meet for a few months, till death\r\nclaimed the brave officer and fine-spirited gentleman who was Matthew\r\nFlinders.\r\n\r\nFrom the correspondence of these weeks a few passages may be chosen, as\r\nshowing the heart-side of a gallant sailor's nature. He wrote to his wife\r\nin June: \"The philosophical calmness which I imposed upon thee is fled\r\nfrom myself, and I am just as awkward without thee as one half of a pair\r\nof scissors without its fellow,\" an image for separation which may be\r\ncommended to any poet ingenious enough to find a rhyme for \"scissors.\"\r\nThe following is dated July 7th: \"I should not forget to say that the\r\ngentle Mr. Bauer seldom forgets to add 'and Mrs. Flinders' good health'\r\nafter the cloth is withdrawn, and even the bluff Mr. Bell does not forget\r\nyou...Thou wilt write me volumes, my dearest love, wilt thou not? No\r\npleasure is at all equal to that I receive from thy letters. The idea of\r\nhow happy we MIGHT be will sometimes intrude itself and take away the\r\nlittle spirits that thy melancholy situation leaves me. I can write no\r\nlonger with this confounded pen. I will find a better to-morrow. May the\r\nchoicest blessings of Heaven go with thee, thou dearest, kindest, best of\r\nwomen.\"\r\n\r\nThis one was written from the Cape in November: \"Write to me constantly;\r\nwrite me pages and volumes. Tell me the dress thou wearest, tell me thy\r\ndreams, anything, so do but talk to me and of thyself. When thou art\r\nsitting at thy needle and alone, then think of me, my love, and write me\r\nthe uppermost of thy thoughts. Fill me half a dozen sheets, and send them\r\nwhen thou canst. Think only, my dearest girl upon the gratification which\r\nthe perusal and reperusal fifty times repeated will afford me, and thou\r\nwilt write me something or other every day. Adieu, my dearest, best love.\r\nHeaven bless thee with health and comfort, and preserve thy full\r\naffection towards thy very own, Matthew Flinders.\"\r\n\r\nTo return from these personal relations to the voyage: Some days before\r\nthe Investigator reached Madeira, a Swedish brig was met, and had to\r\nreceive a lesson in nautical manners during war-time. The incident is\r\nreported by seaman Samuel Smith with a pretty mixture of pronouns,\r\ngenders and tenses: \"At night we was piped all hands in the middle watch\r\nto quarters. A brig was bearing down upon our starboard bow. Our Captn\r\nspoke her, but receiving no answer we fired a gun past his stern. Tacked\r\nship and spoke her, which proved to be a Swede.\"* (* Manuscript, Mitchell\r\nLibrary: \"Journal of Samuel Smith, Seaman, who served on board the\r\nInvestigator, Captain Flinders, on a voyage of discovery in the South\r\nSeas.\" The manuscript covers 52 small quarto pages, and is neatly\r\nwritten. Some of Smith's dates are wrong. It may be noted here that\r\nSmith, on his return from the voyage, was impressed in the Downs and\r\nretained in the Navy till 1815. He died at Thornton's Court, Manchester,\r\nin 1821, aged 50. He was therefore 30 years of age when he made this\r\nvoyage.)\r\n\r\nFlinders was, it has been said, the nautical grandson of Cook. How\r\nthoroughly he followed the example of the great sailor is apparent from\r\nthe lines upon which he managed his ship and governed his crew. This is\r\nwhat he was able to write of the voyage down to the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nreached on October 16th: \"At this time we had not a single person in the\r\nsick list, both officers and men being fully in as good health as when we\r\nsailed from Spithead. I had begun very early to put in execution the\r\nbeneficial plan first practised and made known by the great Captain Cook.\r\nIt was in the standing orders of the ship, that on every fine day the\r\ndeck below and the cockpit should be cleaned, washed, aired with stoves,\r\nand sprinkled with vinegar. On wet and dull days they were cleaned and\r\naired, without washing. Care was taken to prevent the people from\r\nsleeping upon deck or lying down in their wet clothes; and once in every\r\nfortnight or three weeks, as circumstances permitted, their beds, and the\r\ncontents of their chests and bags were opened out and exposed to the sun\r\nand air. On the Sunday and Thursday mornings, the ship's company was\r\nmustered, and every man appeared clean-shaved and dressed; and when the\r\nevenings were fine the drum and fife announced the forecastle to be the\r\nscene of dancing; nor did I discourage other playful amusements which\r\nmight occasionally be more to the taste of the sailors, and were not\r\nunseasonable.\r\n\r\n\"Within the tropics lime juice and sugar were made to suffice as\r\nantiscorbutics; on reaching a higher latitude, sour-krout and vinegar\r\nwere substituted; the essence of malt was served for the passage to New\r\nHolland, and for future occasions, on consulting with the surgeon, I had\r\nthought it expedient to make some slight changes in the issuing of the\r\nprovisions. Oatmeal was boiled for breakfast four days in the week, as\r\nusual; and at other times, two ounces of portable broth, in cakes, to\r\neach man, with such additions of onions, pepper, etc., as the different\r\nmesses possessed, made a comfortable addition to their salt meat. And\r\nneither in this passage, nor, I may add, in any subsequent part of the\r\nvoyage, were the officers or people restricted to any allowance of fresh\r\nwater. They drank freely at the scuttled cask, and took away, under the\r\ninspection of the officer of the watch, all that was requisite for\r\nculinary purposes; and very frequently two casks of water in the week\r\nwere given for washing their clothes. With these regulations, joined to a\r\ndue enforcement of discipline, I had the satisfaction to see my people\r\norderly and full of zeal for the service in which we were engaged; and in\r\nsuch a state of health that no delay at the Cape was required beyond the\r\nnecessary refitment of the ship.\"\r\n\r\nHow wise, considerate, and farseeing this policy was! It reads like the\r\nsageness of a gray-headed veteran. Yet Flinders had only attained his\r\n27th birthday precisely seven months before he reached the Cape on this\r\nvoyage. He had learned how men, as well as ships, should be managed. \"It\r\nwas part of my plan for preserving the health of the people to promote\r\nactive amusements amongst them,\" he said of the jollity on crossing the\r\nline; and we can almost see the smile of recollection which played upon\r\nhis lips when he wrote that \"the seamen were furnished with the means and\r\nthe permission to conclude the day with merriment.\" Seaman Smith, who\r\nshared in the fun, tells us what occurred with his own peculiar disregard\r\nof correct spelling and grammatical construction: \"we crossd the\r\nequinocial line and had the usuil serimony of Neptune and his attendance\r\nhailing the ship and coming on board. The greatest part of officers and\r\nmen was shaved, not having crossd the line before. At night grog was\r\nservd out to each watch, which causd the evening to be spent in\r\nmerriment.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Cape the seams were re-caulked, and the ship gave less trouble on\r\nthe voyage across the Indian Ocean than she had done on the run south.\r\nShe left False Bay on November 4th. The run across the Indian Ocean was\r\nuneventful, except that the ship ran foul of a whale apparently sleeping\r\non the water, and \"caused such an alarm that he sank as expeditiously as\r\npossible\"; and that an albatross was captured which, \"being caught with\r\nhook and line it had its proper faculties and appeared of a varocious\r\nnature.\"* (* Smith's Journal, Mitchell Library manuscripts.) On December\r\n6th the coast of Australia was sighted near Cape Leeuwin.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13. THE FRENCH EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to devote some attention to the French expedition of\r\ndiscovery, commanded by Nicolas Baudin, which sailed from Havre on\r\nOctober 19th, 1800, nearly two months before the British Admiralty\r\nauthorised the despatch of the Investigator, and nine months all but two\r\ndays before Flinders was permitted to leave England.\r\n\r\nThe mere fact that this expedition was despatched while Napoleon\r\nBonaparte was First Consul of the French Republic, has led many writers\r\nto jump to the conclusion that it was designed to cut out a portion of\r\nAustralia for occupation by the French; that, under the thin disguise of\r\nbeing charged with a scientific mission, Baudin was in reality an\r\nemissary of Machiavellian statecraft, making a cunning move in the great\r\ngame of world-politics. The author has, in an earlier book* endeavoured\r\nto show that such was not the case. (* Terre Napoleon (London, 1910).\r\nSince that book was published, I have had the advantage of reading a\r\nlarge quantity of manuscript material, all unpublished, preserved in the\r\nArchives Nationales and the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris. It strengthens\r\nthe main conclusions promulgated in Terre Napoleon, but of course\r\namplifies the evidence very considerably. The present chapter is written\r\nwith the Baudin and other manuscripts, as well as the printed material,\r\nin mind.) Bonaparte did not originate the discovery voyage. He simply\r\nauthorised it, as head of the State, when the proposition was laid before\r\nhim by the Institute of France, a scientific body, concerned with the\r\naugmentation of knowledge, and anxious that an effort should be made to\r\ncomplete a task which the abortive expeditions of Laperouse and\r\nDentrecasteaux had failed to accomplish.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if Bonaparte had wished to acquire territory in Australia, he\r\nwas not so foolish a person as to fit out an expedition estimated to cost\r\nover half a million francs,* and which actually cost a far larger sum,\r\nwhen he could have obtained what he wanted simply by asking. (* Report of\r\nthe Commission of the Institute manuscripts, Bibliotheque Nationale,\r\nnouveaux acquisitions, France 9439 page 139.) The treaty of Amiens was\r\nnegotiated and signed while Baudin's ships were at sea. The British\r\nGovernment at that time was very anxious for peace, and was prepared to\r\nmake concessions--did, in fact, surrender a vast extent of territory won\r\nby a woful expenditure of blood and treasure. It cannot be said that\r\nAustralia was greatly valued by Great Britain at the time. She occupied\r\nonly a small portion of an enormous continent, and would certainly not\r\nhave seriously opposed a project that the French should occupy some other\r\nportion of it, if Bonaparte had put forward a claim as a condition of\r\npeace. But he did nothing of the kind.\r\n\r\nIf we are to form sound views of history, basing conclusions on the\r\nevidence, we must set aside suspicions generated at a time of fierce\r\nracial antipathy, when it was almost part of an Englishman's creed to\r\nhate a Frenchman. Neither the published history of Baudin's voyage, nor\r\nthe papers relating to it which are now available for study--except two\r\ndocuments to which special attention will be devoted hereafter, and which\r\ndid not emanate from persons in authority--afford warrant for believing\r\nthat there was any other object in view than that professed when\r\napplication for a passport was made to the Admiralty. The confidential\r\ninstructions of the Minister* of Marine (* Manuscripts, Archives\r\nNationales BB4 999, Marine. I have given an account of this important\r\nmanuscript, with copious extracts, in the English Historical Review,\r\nApril, 1913.) to Baudin* leave no doubt that the purpose was quite bona\r\nfide. (* Fleurieu to Forfait, manuscripts, Bibliotheque Nationale,\r\nnouveaux acquisitions, France 9439 page 137.) \"Your labours,\" wrote\r\nForfait, \"having for their sole object the perfecting of scientific\r\nknowledge, you should observe the most complete neutrality, allowing no\r\ndoubt to be cast upon your exactitude in confining yourself to the object\r\nof your mission, as set forth in the passports which have been furnished.\r\nIn your relations with foreigners, the glorious success of our arms, the\r\npower and wisdom of your government, the grand and generous views of the\r\nFirst Consul for the pacification of Europe, the order that he has\r\nrestored in the interior of France, furnish you with the means of giving\r\nto foreign peoples just ideas upon the real state of the Republic and\r\nupon the prosperity which is assured to it.\" The men of science who had\r\npromoted the voyage were anxious that not even a similitude of\r\nirregularity should be permitted. Thus we find the Comte de Fleurieu, who\r\ndrew up the itinerary, writing to the Minister urging him to include in\r\nthe instructions a paragraph prohibiting the ships from taking on board,\r\nunder any pretext, merchandise which could give to a scientific\r\nexpedition the appearance of a commercial venture, \"because if an English\r\ncruiser or man-of-war should visit them, and find on board other goods\r\nthan articles of exchange for dealing with aboriginal peoples, this might\r\nserve as a pretext for arresting them, and Baudin's passport might be\r\ndisregarded on the ground that it had been abused by being employed as a\r\nmeans of conducting without risk a traffic which the state of war would\r\nmake very lucrative.\"\r\n\r\nThe question of the origin and objects of the expedition is, however, an\r\nentirely different one from that of the use which Napoleon would have\r\nmade of the information collected, had the opportunity been available of\r\nstriking a blow at Great Britain through her southern colony. It is also\r\ndifferent from the question (as to which something will be said later) of\r\nthe advantage taken by two members of Baudin's staff of the scope allowed\r\nthem at Port Jackson, to \"spy out the land\" with a view of furnishing\r\ninformation valuable in a military sense to their Government.\r\n\r\nThe instructions to Baudin were very similar to those which had been\r\ngiven to Laperouse and Dentrecasteaux in previous years, being drafted by\r\nthe same hand, and some paragraphs in an \"instruction particuliere,\" show\r\nthat the French were thoroughly up-to-date with their information, and\r\nknew in what parts of the coast fresh work required to be done.* (*\r\n\"Projet d'itineraire pour le Commandant Baudin; memoire pour servir\r\nd'instruction particuliere.\" Manuscripts, Archives Nationales, Marine BB4\r\n999.)\r\n\r\nNicolas Baudin was not a French naval officer. He had been in the\r\nmerchant service, and, more recently, had had charge of an expedition\r\ndespatched to Africa by the Austrian Government to collect specimens for\r\nthe museum at Vienna. War between France and Austria broke out before he\r\nreturned; and Baudin, feeling less loyal to his Austrian employers than\r\nto his own country, handed over the whole collection to the Museum in\r\nParis. This action, which in the circumstances was probably regarded as\r\npatriotic, brought him under the notice of Jussieu, the famous French\r\nbotanist; and when the South Sea expedition was authorised, that\r\nscientist recommended Baudin as one who had taken an interest in natural\r\nhistory researches, and who had given \"a new proof of his talent and of\r\nhis love for science by the choice of the specimens composing his last\r\ncollection, deposited in the museum.\" The Minister of Marine minuted\r\nJussieu's recommendation in the margin: \"No choice could be happier than\r\nthat of Captain Baudin,\"* and so he was appointed. (* Manuscripts,\r\nBibliotheque Nationale, nouveaux acquisitions, France 9439 page 121.) He\r\nwas by no means the kind of officer whom Napoleon would have selected had\r\nhis designs been such as have commonly been alleged.\r\n\r\nTwo ships of the navy were commissioned for the service. Under the names\r\nLa Serpente and Le Vesuve they had been built with a view to an invasion\r\nof England, contemplated in 1793.* (* Manuscripts, Bibliotheque\r\nNationale, nouveaux acquisitions, France 9439 report of de Bruix to the\r\nMinister.) They were re-named Le Geographe and Le Naturaliste on being\r\nallotted to a much safer employment. Both were described as solidly\r\nbuilt, good sailers, and easy to control; and the officer who surveyed\r\nthem to determine whether they would be suitable reported that without\r\nimpairing their sea-going qualities it would be easy to construct upon\r\ntheir decks high poops to hold quantities of growing plants, which it was\r\nintended to collect and bring home. On these ships Baudin and his\r\nselected staff embarked at Havre, and, a British passport being obtained\r\nunder the circumstances already related, sailed south in October.\r\n\r\nIf Baudin had been the keen and capable commander that those who secured\r\nhis appointment believed him to be, he should have discovered and charted\r\nthe whole of the unknown southern coast of Australia, before Flinders was\r\nmany days' sail from England. The fact that this important work was\r\nactually done by the English navigator was in no measure due to the\r\nsagacity of the Admiralty--whose officials procrastinated in an\r\ninexplicable fashion even after the Investigator had been commissioned\r\nand equipped--but to his own promptness, competence and zeal, and the\r\npeculiar dilatoriness of his rivals. Baudin's vessels reached\r\nIle-de-France (Mauritius) in March, 1801, and lay there for the leisurely\r\nspace of forty days. Two-thirds of a year had elapsed before they came\r\nupon the Australian coast. But Baudin did not even then set to work where\r\nthere was discovery to be achieved. Winter was approaching, and sailing\r\nin these southern seas would be uncomfortable in the months of storm and\r\ncold; so he dawdled up the west coast of Australia, in warm, pleasant\r\nwaters, and made for Timor, where he arrived in August. He remained in\r\nthe Dutch port of Kupang till the middle of November--three whole months\r\nwasted, nearly eleven months consumed since he had sailed from France. In\r\nthe meantime, the alert and vigorous captain of the Investigator was\r\nspeeding south as fast as the winds would take him, too eager to lose a\r\nday, flying straight to his work like an arrow to its mark, and doing it\r\nwith the thoroughness and accuracy that were part of his nature.\r\n\r\nThe French on board Le Geographe and Le Naturaliste were as unhappy as\r\ntheir commander was slow. Scurvy broke out, and spread among the crew\r\nwith virulence. Baudin appeared to have little or no conception of the\r\nimportance of the sanitary measures which Cook was one of the earliest\r\nnavigators to enjoin, and by which those who emulated his methods were\r\nable to keep in check the ravages of this scourge of seafaring men. He\r\nneglected common precautions, and paid no heed to the counsel of the\r\nship's surgeons. As a consequence, the sufferings of his men were such\r\nthat it is pitiful to read about them in the official history of the\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nFrom Timor Baudin sailed for southern Tasmania, arriving there in\r\nJanuary, 1802, and remaining in the neighbourhood till March. There was\r\nno European settlement upon the island at that time, and Baudin described\r\nit as a country \"which ought not to be neglected, and which a nation that\r\ndoes not love us does not look upon with indifference.\"* (* Baudin to the\r\nMinister of Marine, manuscripts, Archives Nationales BB4 995 Marine.) A\r\nsevere storm separated Le Geographe from her escort on March 7 and 8, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the eastern entrance of Bass Strait. Le Naturaliste\r\nspent some time in Westernport, making a survey of it, and discovering\r\nthe second island, which Bass had missed on his whaleboat cruise. Her\r\ncommander, Captain Hamelin, then took her round to Port Jackson, to\r\nsolicit aid from the Governor of the English colony there. Meanwhile\r\nBaudin sailed through the Strait from east to west. He called at\r\nWaterhouse Island, off the north-east coast of Van Diemen's Land, misled\r\nby its name into thinking that he would find fresh water there. The\r\nisland was named after Captain Henry Waterhouse of the Reliance, but\r\nBaudin, unaware of this, considered that it belied its name. \"It does not\r\nseem,\" he wrote, \"to offer any appearance of water being discoverable\r\nthere, and I am persuaded that it can have been named Water House only\r\nbecause the English visited it at a time when heavy rains had fallen.\"*\r\n(* Baudin's Diary, manuscripts, Bibliotheque Nationale: \"Je suis persuade\r\nqu'on ne l'a nomme Wather House que par ce que les Anglais qui l'ont\r\nvisite y auront eu beaucoup de pluie.\") Baudin passed Port Phillip,\r\nrounded Cape Otway, and coasted along till he came to Encounter Bay,\r\nwhere occurred an incident with which we shall be concerned after we have\r\ntraced the voyage of Flinders eastward to the same point.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14. SOUTH COAST DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\nWe now resume the story of Flinders' voyage along the southern coast of\r\nAustralia, from the time when he made Cape Leeuwin on December 6th, 1801.\r\n\r\nThat part of the coast lying between the south-west corner of the\r\ncontinent and Fowler's Bay, in the Great Australian Bight, had been\r\ntraversed prior to this time. In 1791 Captain George Vancouver, in the\r\nBritish ship Cape Chatham, sailed along it from Cape Leeuwin to King\r\nGeorge's Sound, which he discovered and named. He anchored in the\r\nharbour, and remained there for a fortnight. He would have liked to\r\npursue the discovery of this unknown country, and did sail further east,\r\nas far as the neighbourhood of Termination Island, in longitude 122\r\ndegrees 8 minutes. But, meeting with adverse winds, he abandoned the\r\nresearch, and resumed his voyage to north-west America across the\r\nPacific. In 1792, Bruny Dentrecasteaux, with the French ships Recherche\r\nand Esperance, searching for tidings of the lost Laperouse, followed the\r\nline of the shore more closely than Vancouver had done, and penetrated\r\nmuch further eastward. His instructions, prepared by Fleurieu, had\r\ndirected him to explore the whole of the southern coast of Australia; but\r\nhe was short of water, and finding nothing but sand and rock, with no\r\nharbour, and no promise of a supply of what he so badly needed, he did\r\nnot continue further than longitude 131 degrees 38 1/2 minutes east,\r\nabout two and a half degrees east of the present border line of Western\r\nand South Australia. These navigators, with the Dutchman Pieter Nuyts, in\r\nthe early part of the seventeenth century, and the Frenchman St. Alouarn,\r\nwho anchored near the Leeuwin in 1772, were the only Europeans known to\r\nhave been upon any part of these southern coasts before the advent of\r\nFlinders; and the extent of the voyage of Nuyts is by no means clear.\r\n\r\nFlinders, as we have seen, laid it down as a guiding principle that he\r\nwould make so complete a survey of the shores visited by him as to leave\r\nlittle for anybody to do after him. He therefore commenced his work\r\nimmediately he touched land, constructing his own charts as the ship\r\nslowly traversed the curves of the coast. The result was that many\r\ncorrections and additions to the charts of Vancouver and Dentrecasteaux\r\nwere made before the entirely new discoveries were commenced. In\r\nannouncing this fact, Flinders, always generous in his references to good\r\nwork done by his predecessors, warmly praised the charts prepared by\r\nBeautemps-Beaupre, \"geographical engineer\" of the Recherche. \"Perhaps no\r\nchart of a coast so little known as this is, will bear a comparison with\r\nits original better than this of M. Beaupre,\" he said. His own charts\r\nwere of course fuller and more precise, but he made no claim to\r\nsuperiority on this account, modestly observing that he would have been\r\nopen to reproach if, after following the coast with an outline of M.\r\nBeaupre's chart before him, he had not effected improvements where\r\ncircumstances did not permit so close an examination to be made in 1792.\r\n\r\nSeveral inland excursions were made, and some of the King George's Sound\r\naboriginals were encountered. Flinders noted down some of their words,\r\nand pointed out the difference from words for the same objects used by\r\nPort Jackson and Van Diemen's Land natives. An exception to this rule was\r\nthe word used for calling to a distance--cau-wah! (come here). This is\r\ncertainly very like the Port Jackson cow-ee, whence comes the one\r\naboriginal word of universal employment in Australia to-day, the coo-ee\r\nof the townsman and the bushman alike, a call entered in the vocabulary\r\ncollected by Hunter as early as 1790.\r\n\r\nThe method of research adopted by Flinders was similar to that employed\r\non the Norfolk voyage. The ship was kept all day as close inshore as\r\npossible, so that water breaking on the shore was visible from the deck,\r\nand no river or opening could escape notice. When this could not be done,\r\nbecause the coast retreated far back, or was dangerous, the commander\r\nstationed himself at the masthead with a glass. All the bearings were\r\nlaid down as soon as taken, whilst the land was in sight; and before\r\nretiring to rest at night Flinders made it a practice to finish up his\r\nrough chart for the day, together with his journal of observations. The\r\nship hauled off the coast at dusk, but especial care was taken to come\r\nupon it at the same point next morning, as soon after daylight as\r\npracticable, so that work might be resumed precisely where it had been\r\ndropped on the previous day. \"This plan,\" said Flinders, \"to see and lay\r\ndown everything myself, required constant attention and much labour, but\r\nwas absolutely necessary to obtaining that accuracy of which I was\r\ndesirous.\" When bays or groups of islands were reached, Flinders went\r\nashore with the theodolite, took his angles, measured, mapped, and made\r\ntopographical notes. The lead was kept busy, making soundings. The rise\r\nand fall of the tides were observed; memoranda on natural phenomena were\r\nwritten; opportunities were given for the naturalists to collect\r\nspecimens, and for the artist to make drawings. The net was frequently\r\ndrawn in the bays for examples of marine life. Everybody when ashore kept\r\na look out for plants, birds, beasts, and insects. In short, a keenness\r\nfor investigation, an assiduity in observation, animated the whole ship's\r\ncompany, stimulated by the example of the commander, who never spared\r\nhimself in his work, and interested himself in that of others.\r\n\r\nAs in a drama, \"comic relief\" was occasionally interposed amid more\r\nserious happenings. The blacks were friendly, though occasionally shy and\r\nsuspicious. In one scene the mimicry that is a characteristic of the\r\naboriginal was quaintly displayed. The incident, full of colour and\r\nhumour, is thus related by Flinders:\r\n\r\n\"Our friends, the natives, continued to visit us; and an old man with\r\nseveral others being at the tents this morning, I ordered the party of\r\nmarines on shore, to be exercised in their presence. The red coats and\r\nwhite crossed belts were greatly admired, having some resemblance to\r\ntheir own manner of ornamenting themselves; and the drum, but\r\nparticularly the fife, excited their astonishment; but when they saw\r\nthese beautiful red and white men, with their bright muskets, drawn up in\r\na line, they absolutely screamed with delight; nor were their wild\r\ngestures and vociferation to be silenced but by commencing the exercise,\r\nto which they paid the most earnest and silent attention. Several of them\r\nmoved their hands, involuntarily, according to the motions; and the old\r\nman placed himself at the end of the rank, with a short staff in his\r\nhand, which he shouldered, presented, grounded, as did the marines their\r\nmuskets, without, I believe, knowing what he did. Before firing, the\r\nIndians were made acquainted with what was going to take place; so that\r\nthe volleys did not excite much terror.\"\r\n\r\nSeaman Smith was naturally much interested in the aboriginals, whose\r\nfeatures were however to him \"quite awful, having such large mouths and\r\nlong teeth.\" They were totally without clothing, and \"as soon as they saw\r\nour tents they run into the bushes with such activity that would pawl any\r\nEuropean to exhibit. Because our men would not give them a small\r\ntommy-hawk they began to throw pieces of wood at them, which exasperated\r\nour men; but orders being so humane towards the natives that we must put\r\nup with anything but heaving spears.\" Furthermore, \"they rubbd their skin\r\nagainst ours, expecting some mark of white upon their's, but finding\r\ntheir mistake they appeared surprised.\"\r\n\r\nPleasures more immediately incidental to geographical discovery--those\r\npleasures which eager and enterprising minds must experience, however\r\nsevere the labour involved, on traversing portions of the globe\r\npreviously unknown to civilised mankind--commenced after the head of the\r\nGreat Bight was passed. From about the vicinity of Fowler's Bay (named\r\nafter the first lieutenant of the Investigator) the coast was virgin to\r\ngeographical science. Comparisons of original work with former charts\r\nwere no longer possible. The ship was entering un-navigated waters, and\r\nthe coasts delineated were new to the world's knowledge. The quickening\r\nof the interest in the work in hand, which touched both officers and men\r\nof the expedition, can be felt by the reader of Flinders' narrative.\r\nThere was a consciousness of having crossed a line separating what simply\r\nrequired verification and amplification, from a totally fresh field of\r\nresearch. Every reach of coastline now traversed was like a cable, long\r\nburied in the deep of time, at length hauled into daylight, with its oozy\r\ndeposits of seaweed, shell and mud lying thick upon it.\r\n\r\nContingent upon discovery was the pleasure of naming important features\r\nof the coast. It is doubtful whether any other single navigator in\r\nhistory applied names which are still in use to so many capes, bays and\r\nislands, upon the shores of the habitable globe, as Flinders did. The\r\nextent of coastline freshly discovered by him was not so great as that\r\nfirst explored by some of his predecessors. But no former navigator\r\npursued extensive new discoveries so minutely, and, consequently, found\r\nso much to name; while the precision of Flinders' records left no doubt\r\nabout the places that he named, when in later years the settlement of\r\ncountry and the navigation of seas necessitated the use of names.\r\nCompare, for instance, in this one respect, the work of Cook and Dampier,\r\nVasco da Gama and Magellan, Tasman and Quiros, with that of Flinders.\r\nHistorically their voyages may have been in some respects more important;\r\nbut they certainly added fewer names to the map. There are 103 names on\r\nCook's charts of eastern Australia from Point Hicks to Cape York; but\r\nthere are about 240 new names on the charts of Flinders representing\r\nsouthern Australia and Tasmania. He is the Great Denominator among\r\nnavigators. He named geographical features after his friends, after his\r\nassociates on the Investigator, after distinguished persons connected\r\nwith the Navy, after places in which he was interested. Fowler's Bay,\r\nPoint Brown, Cape Bauer, Franklin's Isles, Point Bell, Point Westall,\r\nTaylor's Isle, and Thistle Island, commemorate his shipmates. Spencer's\r\nGulf was named \"in honour of the respected nobleman who presided at the\r\nBoard of Admiralty when the voyage was planned and the ship was put in\r\ncommission,\" and Althorp Isles celebrated Lord Spencer's heir.* (*\r\nCockburn, Nomenclature of South Australia, (Adelaide 1909) page 9, is\r\nmistaken in speculating that \"there is a parish of Althorp in Flinders'\r\nnative country in Lincolnshire which probably accounts for the choice of\r\nthe name here.\" Althorp, which should be spelt without a final \"e,\" is\r\nnot in Lincolnshire, but in Northamptonshire.) St. Vincent's Gulf was\r\nnamed \"in honour of the noble admiral\" who was at the head of the\r\nAdmiralty when the Investigator sailed from England, and who had\r\n\"continued to the voyage that countenance and protection of which Earl\r\nSpencer had set the example.\" To Yorke's Peninsula, between the two\r\ngulfs, was affixed the name of the Right Hon. C.P. Yorke, afterwards Lord\r\nHardwicke, the First Lord who authorised the publication of Flinders'\r\nVoyage. Thus, the ministerial heads of the Admiralty in three Governments\r\n(Pitt's, Addington's and Spencer Perceval's) came to be commemorated. It\r\nmay be remarked as curious that a naval officer so proud of his service\r\nas Flinders was, should nowhere have employed the name of the greatest\r\nsailor of his age, Nelson. There is a Cape Nelson on the Victorian coast,\r\nbut that name was given by Grant.\r\n\r\nIn Spencer's Gulf we come upon a group of Lincolnshire place-names, for\r\nFlinders, his brother Samuel, the mate, Fowler, and Midshipman John\r\nFranklin, all serving on this voyage, were Lincolnshire men. Thus we find\r\nPort Lincoln, Sleaford Bay, Louth Bay, Cape Donington, Stamford Hill,\r\nSurfleet Point, Louth Isle, Sibsey Isle, Stickney Isle, Spilsby Isle,\r\nPartney Isle, Revesby Isle, Point Boston, and Winceby Isle. Banks' name\r\nwas given to a group of islands, and Coffin's Bay must not be allowed to\r\nsuggest any gruesome association, for it was named after Sir Isaac\r\nCoffin, resident naval commissioner at Sheerness, who had given\r\nassistance in the equipment of the Investigator. A few names, like\r\nStreaky Bay, Lucky Bay, and Cape Catastrophe, were applied from\r\ncircumstances that occurred on the voyage. A poet of the antipodes who\r\nshould, like Wordsworth, be moved to write \"Poems on the Naming of\r\nPlaces,\" would find material in the names given by Flinders.\r\n\r\nInterest in this absorbing work rose to something like excitement on\r\nFebruary 20th, when there were indications, from the set of the tide,\r\nthat an unusual feature of the coast was being approached. \"The tide from\r\nthe north-eastward, apparently the ebb, ran more than one mile an hour,\r\nwhich was the more remarkable from no set of the tide worthy to be\r\nnoticed having hitherto been observed upon this coast.\" The ship had\r\nrounded Cape Catastrophe, and the land led away to the north, whereas\r\nhitherto it had trended east and south. What did this mean? Flinders must\r\nhave been strongly reminded of his experience in the Norfolk in Bass\r\nStrait, when the rush of the tide from the south showed that the\r\nnorth-west corner of Van Diemen's Land had been turned, and that the\r\ndemonstration of the Strait's existence was complete. There were many\r\nspeculations as to what the signs indicated. \"Large rivers, deep inlets,\r\ninland seas and passages into the Gulf of Carpentaria, were terms\r\nfrequently used in our conversations of this evening, and the prospect of\r\nmaking an interesting discovery seemed to have infused new life and\r\nvigour into every man in the ship.\" The expedition was, in fact, in the\r\nbell-mouth of Spencer's Gulf, and the next few days were to show whether\r\nthe old surmise was true--that Terra Australis was cloven in twain by a\r\nstrait from the Gulf of Carpentaria to the southern ocean. It was,\r\nindeed, a crisis-time of the discovery voyage.\r\n\r\nBut before the gulf was examined, a tragedy threw the ship into mourning.\r\nOn the evening of Sunday, February 21st, the cutter was returning from\r\nthe mainland, where a party had been searching for water in charge of the\r\nMaster, John Thistle. She carried a midshipman, William Taylor, and six\r\nsailors. Nobody on the ship witnessed the accident that happened; but the\r\ncutter had been seen coming across the water, and as she did not arrive\r\nwhen darkness set in, the fear that she had gone down oppressed everybody\r\non board. A search was made, but ineffectually; and next day the boat was\r\nfound floating bottom uppermost, stove in, and bearing the appearance of\r\nhaving been dashed against rocks. The loss of John Thistle was especially\r\ngrievous to Flinders. The two had been companions from the very beginning\r\nof his career in Australia. Thistle had been one of Bass's crew in the\r\nwhaleboat; he had been on the Norfolk when Van Diemen's Land was\r\ncircumnavigated; and he had taken part in the cruise to Moreton Bay. His\r\nmemory lives in the name of Thistle Island, on the west of the entrance\r\nto the gulf, and in the noble tribute which his commander paid to his\r\nadmirable qualities. It would be wrong to deprive the reader of the\r\nsatisfaction of reading Flinders' eulogy of his companion of strenuous\r\nyears:\r\n\r\n\"The reader will pardon me the observation that Mr. Thistle was truly a\r\nvaluable man, as a seaman, an officer, and a good member of society. I\r\nhad known him, and we had mostly served together, from the year 1794. He\r\nhad been with Mr. Bass in his perilous expedition in the whaleboat, and\r\nwith me in the voyage round Van Diemen's Land, and in the succeeding\r\nexpedition to Glass House and Hervey's Bays. From his merit and prudent\r\nconduct, he was promoted from before the mast to be a midshipman and\r\nafterwards a master in His Majesty's service. His zeal for discovery had\r\ninduced him to join the Investigator when at Spithead and ready to sail,\r\nalthough he had returned to England only three weeks before, after an\r\nabsence of six years.* Besides performing assiduously the duties of his\r\nsituation, Mr. Thistle had made himself well acquainted with the practice\r\nof nautical astronomy, and began to be very useful in the surveying\r\ndepartment. His loss was severely felt by me, and he was lamented by all\r\non board, more especially by his messmates, who knew more intimately the\r\ngoodness and stability of his disposition.\" (* In a letter to Banks from\r\nSpithead on June 3rd, 1801, Flinders had written: \"I am happy to inform\r\nyou that the Buffalo has brought home a person formerly of the Reliance\r\nwhom I wish to have as master. He volunteers, the captain of the ship\r\nagrees, and I have made application by to-day's post and expect his\r\nappointmnt by Friday.\" The reference was evidently to John Thistle.)\r\n\r\nTaylor's Isle was named after the young midshipman of this catastrophe,\r\nand six small islands in the vicinity bear the names of the boat's crew.\r\nIt is a singular fact that only two of the eight sailors drowned could\r\nswim. Even Captain Cook never learnt to swim!\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the neighbourhood, Flinders erected a copper plate upon a\r\nstone post at the head of Memory Cove, and had engraved upon it the names\r\nof the unfortunates who had perished, with a brief account of the\r\naccident. Two fragments of the original plate are now in the museum at\r\nAdelaide. In later years it was beaten down by a storm, and the South\r\nAustralian Government erected a fresh tablet in Memory Cove to replace\r\nit.\r\n\r\nA thorough survey of Port Lincoln was made while the ship was being\r\nreplenished with water. Some anxiety had been felt owing to the lack of\r\nthis necessity, and Flinders showed the way to obtain it by digging holes\r\nin the white clay surrounding a brackish marsh which he called Stamford\r\nMere. The water that drained into the holes was found to be sweet and\r\nwholesome, though milky in appearance. As the filling of the casks and\r\nconveying them to the ship--to a quantity of 60 tons--occupied several\r\ndays, the surveying and scientific employments were pursued diligently on\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of Port Lincoln was in itself an event of consequence,\r\nsince it is a harbour of singular commodiousness and beauty, and would,\r\ndid it but possess a more prolific territory at its back, be a maritime\r\nstation of no small importance. Nearly forty years later, Sir John\r\nFranklin, then Governor of Tasmania, paid a visit to Port Lincoln,\r\nexpressly to renew acquaintance with a place in the discovery of which he\r\nhad participated in company with a commander whose memory he honoured;\r\nand he erected on Stamford Hill, at his own cost, an obelisk in\r\ncommemoration of Flinders. In the same way, on his first great overland\r\narctic journey in 1821, Franklin remembered Flinders in giving names to\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nIt was on March 6th that the exploration of Spencer's Gulf commenced. As\r\nthe ship sailed along the western shore, the expectations which had been\r\nformed of a strait leading through the continent to the Gulf of\r\nCarpentaria faded away. The coast lost its boldness, the water became\r\nmore and more shallow, and the opposite shore began to show itself. The\r\ngulf was clearly tapering to an end. \"Our prospects of a channel or\r\nstrait cutting off some considerable portion of Terra Australis grew\r\nless, for it now appeared that the ship was entering into a gulph.\" On\r\nthe 10th, the Investigator having passed Point Lowly, and having on the\r\nprevious day suddenly come into two-and-a-half fathoms, Flinders decided\r\nto finish the exploration in a rowing boat, accompanied by Surgeon Bell.\r\nThey rowed along the shore till night fell, slept in the boat, and\r\nresumed the journey early next morning (March 11th). At ten o'clock, the\r\noars touched mud on each side, and it became impossible to proceed\r\nfurther. They had reached the head of the gulf, then a region of mangrove\r\nswamps and flat waters, but now covered by the wharves of Port Augusta,\r\nand within view of the starting point of the transcontinental railway.\r\n\r\nThe disappointment was undoubtedly great at not finding even a large\r\nriver flowing into the gulf. The hope of a strait had been abandoned as\r\nthe continually converging shores, shallow waters, and diminishing banks\r\nmade it clear, long before the head was reached, that the theory of a\r\nbifurcated Terra Australis was impossible. But as Flinders completed his\r\nchart and placed it against the outline of the continent, he might fairly\r\nenjoy the happiness of having settled an important problem and of taking\r\none more stride towards completing the map of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Investigator travelled down by the eastern shore, once hanging upon a\r\nnear bank for half an hour, and by March 20th was well outside. The\r\nlength of the gulf, from the head to Gambier Island, Flinders calculated\r\nto be 185 miles, and its width at the mouth, in a line from Cape\r\nCatastrophe, 48 miles. At the top it tapered almost to a point. The whole\r\nof it was personally surveyed and charted by Flinders, who was able to\r\nwrite that for the general exactness of his drawing he could \"answer with\r\ntolerable confidence, having seen all that is laid down, and, as usual,\r\ntaken every angle which enters into the construction.\"\r\n\r\nThe next discovery of importance was that of Kangaroo Island, separated\r\nfrom the foot-like southern projection of Yorke's Peninsula by\r\nInvestigator Strait. The island was named on account of the quantity of\r\nkangaroos seen and shot upon it; for a supply of fresh meat was very\r\nwelcome after four months of salt pork. Thirty-one fell to the guns of\r\nthe Investigator's men. Half a hundredweight of heads, forequarters and\r\ntails were stewed down for soup, and as much kangaroo steak was available\r\nfor officers and men as they could consume \"by day and night.\" It was\r\ndeclared to be a \"delightful regale.\"\r\n\r\nThe place where Flinders is believed to have first landed on Kangaroo\r\nIsland is now marked by a tall cairn, which was spontaneously built by\r\nthe inhabitants, the school children assisting, in 1906. An inscription\r\non a faced stone commemorates the event. The white pyramid can be seen\r\nfrom vessels using Backstairs Passage.* (* See the account of the making\r\nof the cairn, by C.E. Owen Smythe, I.S.O., who initiated and\r\nsuperintended the work, South Australian Geographical Society's\r\nProceedings 1906 page 58.)\r\n\r\nA very short stay was made at Kangaroo Island on this first call. On\r\nMarch 24th Investigator Strait was crossed, and the examination of the\r\nmainland was resumed. The ship was steered north-west, and, the coast\r\nbeing reached, no land was visible to the eastward. The conclusion was\r\ndrawn that another gulf ran inland, and the surmise proved to be correct.\r\nThe new discovery, named St. Vincent's Gulf, was penetrated on the 27th,\r\nand was first explored on the eastern shore, not on the western as had\r\nbeen the case with Spencer's Gulf. Mount Lofty was sighted at dawn on\r\nSunday, March 28th. The nearest part of the coast was three leagues\r\ndistant at the time, \"mostly low, and composed of sand and rock, with a\r\nfew small trees scattered over it; but at a few miles inland, where the\r\nback mountains rise, the country was well clothed with forest timber, and\r\nhad a fertile appearance. The fires bespoke this to be a part of the\r\ncontinent.\" The coast to the northward was seen to be very low, and the\r\nsoundings were fast decreasing. From noon to six o'clock the Investigator\r\nran north thirty miles, skirting a sandy shore, and at length dropped\r\nanchor in five fathoms.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning land was seen to the westward, as well as\r\neastward, and there was \"a hummocky mountain, capped with clouds,\r\napparently near the head of the inlet.\" Wind failing, very little\r\nprogress was made till noon, and at sunset the shores appeared to be\r\nclosing round. The absence of tide gave no prospect of finding a river at\r\nthe head of the gulf. Early on the morning of the 30th Flinders went out\r\nin a boat, accompanied by Robert Brown, and rowed up to the mud-flats at\r\nthe head of the gulf. Picking out a narrow channel, it was found possible\r\nto get within half a mile of dry land. Then, leaving the boat, Flinders\r\nand Brown walked along a bank of mud and sand to the shore, to examine\r\nthe country. Flinders ascended one of the foot-hills of the range that\r\nforms the backbone of Yorke's Peninsula, stretching north and south\r\nupwards of two hundred miles.\r\n\r\nAt dawn on March 31st the Investigator was got under way to proceed down\r\nthe eastern side of Yorke's Peninsula. The wind was contrary, and the\r\nwork could be done only \"partially,\" though, of course, sufficiently well\r\nto complete the chart. The peninsula was described as \"singular in form,\r\nhaving some resemblance to a very ill-shaped leg and foot.\" Its length\r\nfrom Cape Spencer to the northern junction with the mainland was\r\ncalculated to be 105 miles. On April 1st Flinders was able to write that\r\nthe exploration of St. Vincent's Gulf was finished.\r\n\r\nThe general character of the country, especially on the east, he\r\nconsidered to be superior to that on the borders of Spencer's Gulf; and\r\nthe subsequent development of the State of South Australia has justified\r\nhis opinion. He would assuredly have desired to linger longer upon the\r\neastern shore, could he have foreseen that within forty years of the\r\ndiscovery there would be laid there the foundations of the noble city of\r\nAdelaide, with its fair and fruitful olive-groves, vineyards, orchards\r\nand gardens, and its busy port, whither flow the wheat of vast plains and\r\nthe wool from a million sheep leagues upon leagues away.\r\n\r\nA second visit to Kangaroo Island was necessitated by a desire to make\r\ncorrections in the Investigator's timekeepers, and on this occasion a\r\nsomewhat longer stay was made. The ship arrived on April 2nd, and did not\r\nleave again till the 7th.\r\n\r\nVery few aboriginals were seen upon the shores of the two gulfs, and\r\nthese only through a telescope. At Port Lincoln some blacks were known to\r\nbe in the neighbourhood, but the expedition did not succeed in getting\r\ninto contact with them. Flinders scrupulously observed the policy of\r\ndoing nothing to alarm them; and his remarks in this relation are\r\ncharacterised by as much good sense as humane feeling. Writing of a small\r\nparty of natives who were heard calling but did not show themselves,\r\nprobably having hidden in thick scrub to observe the boat's crew, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"No attempt was made to follow them, for I had always found the natives\r\nof this country to avoid those who seemed anxious for communication;\r\nwhereas, when left entirely alone, they would usually come down after\r\nhaving watched us for a few days. Nor does this conduct seem to be\r\nunnatural; for what, in such case, would be the conduct of any people,\r\nourselves for instance, were we living in a state of nature, frequently\r\nat war with our neighbours, and ignorant of the existence of any other\r\nnation? On the arrival of strangers so different in complexion and\r\nappearance to ourselves, having power to transplant themselves over, and\r\neven living upon, an element which to us was impossible, the first\r\nsensation would probably be terror, and the first movement flight. We\r\nshould watch these extraordinary people from our retreats in the woods\r\nand rocks, and if we found ourselves sought and pursued by them, should\r\nconclude their designs to be inimical; but if, on the contrary, we saw\r\nthem quietly employed in occupations which had no reference to us,\r\ncuriosity would get the better of fear, and after observing them more\r\nclosely, we should ourselves risk a communication. Such seemed to have\r\nbeen the conduct of these Australians;* and I am persuaded that their\r\nappearance on the morning when the tents were struck was a prelude to\r\ntheir coming down; and that, had we remained a few days longer, a\r\nfriendly communication would have ensued. The way was, however, prepared\r\nfor the next ship which may visit this port, as it was to us in King\r\nGeorge's Sound by Captain Vancouver and the ship Elligood; to whose\r\nprevious visits and peaceable conduct we were most probably indebted for\r\nour early intercourse with the inhabitants of that place. So far as could\r\nbe perceived with a glass, the natives of this port were the same in\r\npersonal appearance as those of King George's Sound and Port Jackson. In\r\nthe hope of conciliating their goodwill to succeeding visitors, some\r\nhatchets and various other articles were left in their paths, fastened to\r\nstumps of trees which had been cut down near our watering pits.\" (* The\r\nonly occasion, I think, where Flinders uses this word. He usually called\r\naboriginals \"Indians.\")\r\n\r\nMore wild life was seen at Kangaroo Island than in the gulf region.\r\nThirty emus were observed on one day; kangaroos, as has been remarked,\r\nwere plentiful; and a large colony of pelicans caused the name of Pelican\r\nLagoon to be given to a feature of the island's eastern lobe. The\r\nmarsupial, the seal, the emu, and the bag-billed bird that nature built\r\nin one of her whimsical moods, had held unchallenged possession for tens\r\nof thousands of years, probably never visited by any ships, nor even\r\npreyed upon by blacks. The reflections of Flinders upon Pelican Lagoon\r\nhave a tinting of poetic feeling which we do not often find in his solid\r\npages:\r\n\r\n\"Flocks of the old birds were sitting upon the beaches of the lagoon, and\r\nit appeared that the islands were their breeding places; not only so, but\r\nfrom the number of skeletons and bones there scattered it should seem\r\nthat they had for ages been selected for the closing scene of their\r\nexistence. Certainly none more likely to be free from disturbance of\r\nevery kind could have been chosen, than these inlets in a hidden lagoon\r\nof an uninhabited island, situate upon an unknown coast near the\r\nantipodes of Europe; nor can anything be more consonant to the feelings,\r\nif pelicans have any, than quietly to resign their breath whilst\r\nsurrounded by their progeny, and in the same spot where they first drew\r\nit. Alas, for the pelicans! their golden age is past; but it has much\r\nexceeded in duration that of man.\"\r\n\r\nThe picture of the zoological interests of Kangaroo Island is heightened\r\nby Flinders' account of the seals and marsupials. \"Never perhaps has the\r\ndominion possessed here by the kangaroo been invaded before this time.\r\nThe seal shared with it upon the shores, but they seemed to dwell\r\namicably together. It not unfrequently happened that the report of a gun\r\nfired at a kangaroo, near the beach, brought out two or three bellowing\r\nseals from under bushes considerably further from the water side. The\r\nseal, indeed, seemed to be much the more discerning animal of the two;\r\nfor its actions bespoke a knowledge of our not being kangaroos, whereas\r\nthe kangaroo not unfrequently appeared to consider us to be seals.\" In\r\nthe quotation, it may be as well to add, the usual spelling of \"kangaroo\"\r\nis followed, but Flinders invariably spelt it \"kanguroo.\" The orthography\r\nof the word was not settled in his time; Cook wrote \"kangooroo\" and\r\n\"kanguru,\" but Hawkesworth, who edited his voyages, made it \"kangaroo.\"\r\n\r\nThe quantity of fallen timber lying upon the island prompted the\r\ncuriosity of Flinders. Trunks of trees lay about in all directions \"and\r\nwere nearly of the same size and in the same progress towards decay; from\r\nwhence it would seem that they had not fallen from age nor yet been\r\nthrown down in a gale of wind. Some general conflagration, and there were\r\nmarks apparently of fire on many of them, is perhaps the sole cause which\r\ncan be reasonably assigned; but whence came the woods on fire? There were\r\nno inhabitants upon the island, and that the natives of the continent did\r\nnot visit it was demonstrated, if not by the want of all signs of such\r\nvisits, yet by the tameness of the kangaroo, an animal which, on the\r\ncontinent, resembles the wild deer in timidity. Perhaps lightning might\r\nhave been the cause, or possibly the friction of two dead trees in a\r\nstrong wind; but it would be somewhat extraordinary that the same thing\r\nshould have happened at Thistle's Island, Boston Island, and at this\r\nplace, and apparently about the same time. Can this part of Terra\r\nAustralis have been visited before, unknown to the world? The French\r\nnavigator, Laperouse, was ordered to explore it, but there seems little\r\nprobability that he ever passed Torres Strait.\r\n\r\n\"Some judgment may be formed of the epoch when these conflagrations\r\nhappened, from the magnitude of the growing trees; for they must have\r\nsprung up since that period. They were a species of eucalyptus, and being\r\nless than the fallen tree, had most probably not arrived at maturity; but\r\nthe wood is hard and solid, and it may thence be supposed to grow slowly.\r\nWith these considerations, I should be inclined to fix the period at not\r\nless than ten, nor more than twenty years before our arrival. This brings\r\nus back to Laperouse. He was in Botany Bay in the beginning of 1788, and,\r\nif he did pass through Torres Strait, and come round to this coast, as\r\nwas his intention, it would probably be about the middle or latter end of\r\nthat year, or between thirteen and fourteen years before the\r\nInvestigator. My opinion is not favourable to this conjecture; but I have\r\nfurnished all the data to enable the reader to form his own opinion upon\r\nthe cause which might have prostrated the woods of these islands.\"\r\n\r\nThe passage is worth quoting, if only for the interesting allusion to\r\nLaperouse, whose fate was, at the time when Flinders sailed and wrote, an\r\nunsolved mystery of the sea. Captain Dillon's discovery of relics at\r\nVanikoro, in 1826, twelve years after the death of Flinders, informed the\r\nworld that the illustrious French navigator did not pass through Torres\r\nStrait, but was wrecked in the Santa Cruz group.* (* See the author's\r\nLaperouse, Sydney 1912 pages 90 et sqq.) The fire, so many signs of which\r\nwere observed on Kangaroo Island, was in all probability caused naturally\r\nin the heat of a dry summer.\r\n\r\nVery shortly after leaving Kangaroo Island Flinders met one of the\r\nvessels of the French exploring expedition; and the story of that\r\noccurrence must occupy our particular consideration in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15. FLINDERS AND BAUDIN IN ENCOUNTER BAY.\r\n\r\nFlinders did not complete the examination of Kangaroo island. The\r\napproach of the winter season, and an apprehension that shortness of\r\nprovisions might compel him to make for Port Jackson before concluding\r\nthe discovery of the south coast, induced him to leave the south and west\r\nparts of the island, with the intention of making a second visit at a\r\nlater time. Therefore, in the afternoon of Tuesday, April 6th, the anchor\r\nwas weighed and he resumed the exploration of the mainland eastward from\r\nCape Jervis, at the extremity of St. Vincent's Gulf. Wind and tide made\r\nagainst a rapid passage, and the east end of Kangaroo Island had not been\r\ncleared by eight o'clock on the following evening.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock on the afternoon of April 8th the sloop was making slow\r\nprogress eastward, when the man aloft reported that a white rock was to\r\nbe seen ahead. The attention of everybody on board was at once turned in\r\nthe direction of the object. Very soon it became apparent that it was not\r\na rock but a ship, which had sighted the Investigator, and was making\r\ntowards her. As no sail had been seen for five months, and it seemed\r\nbeyond all likelihood that another ship should be spoken in these\r\nuncharted seas, where there was no settlement, no port at which\r\nrefreshment could be obtained, no possibility of trade, no customary\r\nmaritime route, it may be imagined that there was a feeling of excitement\r\namong the ship's company. Flinders of course knew that the French had a\r\ndiscovery expedition somewhere in Australasian waters, and the fact that\r\nit had secured some months' start of him had occasioned a certain amount\r\nof anxiety before he left England. He was aware that it was protected by\r\na passport from the British Government. The approaching vessel might be\r\none of Baudin's; but she might by some strange chance be an enemy's ship\r\nof war. In any case, he prepared for emergencies: \"we cleared for action\r\nin case of being attacked.\"\r\n\r\nGlasses were turned on the stranger, which proved on closer scrutiny to\r\nbe \"a heavy-looking ship, without any top-gallant masts up.\" The\r\nInvestigator hoisted her colours--the Union Jack, it may be remarked,\r\nsince that flag was adopted by Great Britain at the beginning of 1801,\r\nbefore the expedition sailed. The stranger put up the tricolour, \"and\r\nafterwards an English Jack forward, as we did a white flag.\"* (* Flinders\r\nrelates the story of his meeting with Baudin, in his Voyage to Terra\r\nAustralis, 1 188, and in letters to the Admiralty; and to Sir Joseph\r\nBanks, printed in Historical Records of New South Wales, 4 749 and 755.\r\nThe official history of the French voyage was written by Francois Peron,\r\nand is printed in his Voyage de Decouvertes aux Terres Australes, 1 324.\r\nBut Peron was not present at the interviews between Flinders and Baudin.\r\nCaptain Baudin's own account of the incident is related in his manuscript\r\ndiary, and in a long letter to the French Minister of Marine, dated \"Port\r\nJackson, 10th November, 1802,\" both of which are in the Archives\r\nNationales, BB4, 995, Marine. These sources have been compared and used\r\nin the writing of this chapter. Baudin's narrative is translated in an\r\nappendix.)\r\n\r\nIt has already been explained (Chapter 11) that Le Geographe, commanded\r\nby the commodore of the French expedition, separated from Le Naturaliste\r\nat the eastern entrance to Bass Strait on March 7th and 8th, and that\r\nBaudin sailed through the Strait westward. We take up the thread again at\r\nthat point, and will follow Baudin until he met Flinders. He was between\r\nWilson's Promontory and Cape Otway from March 28th to 31st, in very good\r\nweather. The most important fact relating to this part of his voyage is\r\nthat he missed the entrance to Port Phillip. In his letter to the\r\nMinister of Marine, he described the Promontory and the situation of\r\nWesternport, and then proceeded to relate that \"from the 9th to the 11th\r\n(of the month Germinal in the French Revolutionary calendar, by which of\r\ncourse Baudin dated events; equivalent to March 30 to April 1st) the\r\nwinds having been very favourable to us, we visited an extensive portion\r\nof the coast, where the land is high, well-wooded, and of an agreeable\r\nappearance, but does not present any place favourable to debarkation. All\r\nthe points were exactly determined, and the appearance of the shores\r\ndepicted.\" That describes the Cape Otway country; and the part of the\r\nletter which follows refers to the land on the west of the Otway. There\r\nis no word of any port being sighted. The letter agrees with what Baudin\r\ntold Flinders, that \"he had found no ports, harbours or inlets, or\r\nanything to interest\"; and Flinders was subsequently surprised to find\r\nthat so large a harbour as Port Phillip had been missed by Baudin, \"more\r\nespecially as he had fine winds and weather.\"* (* Flinders to Banks,\r\nHist. Rec. 4 755.) Nevertheless, when Peron and Freycinet came to write\r\nthe history of the French voyage--knowing then of the existence of Port\r\nPhillip, and having a chart of it before them--they very boldly claimed\r\nthat they had seen it, and had distinguished its contours from the\r\nmasthead,* a thing impossible to do from the situation in which they\r\nwere. (* Voyage de Decouvertes 1 316 and 3 115.)\r\n\r\nThe company on board Le Geographe were as excited about the ship sailing\r\neastward, as were the Investigator's men when the reported white rock\r\nahead proved to be the sails of another vessel. The French crew were in a\r\ndistressingly sick condition. Scurvy had played havoc among them, much of\r\nthe ship's meat was worm-eaten and stinking, and a large number of the\r\ncrew were incapacitated. On the morning of April 8th some of Baudin's\r\npeople had been engaged in harpooning dolphins. They were desperately in\r\nneed of fresh food, and a shoal of these rapid fish, appearing and\r\nplaying around the prow, appeared to them \"like a gift from heaven.\" Nine\r\nlarge dolphins had been caught, giving a happy promise of enough meat to\r\nlast a day or two, when the man at the masthead reported that there was a\r\nsail in sight. At first Baudin was of opinion that the ship ahead was Le\r\nNaturaliste, rejoining company after a month's separation. But as the\r\ndistance between the two ships diminished, and the Investigator ran up\r\nher ensign, her nationality was perceived, and Baudin hoisted the\r\ntricolour.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the Investigator when she hove to was in 35 degrees 40\r\nminutes south and 138 degrees 58 minutes east. The time was half-past\r\nfive o'clock in the evening; the position about five miles south-west of\r\nthe nearest bit of coast, in what Flinders called Encounter Bay, in\r\ncommemoration of the event. Le Geographe passed the English ship with a\r\nfree wind, and as she did so Flinders hailed her, enquiring \"Are you\r\nCaptain Baudin?\" \"It is he,\" was the response. Flinders thereupon called\r\nout that he was very glad to meet the French explorer, and Baudin\r\nresponded in cordial terms, without, however, knowing whom he was\r\naddressing. Still the wariness of the English captain was not to be\r\nlulled; he records, \"we veered round as Le Geographe was passing, so as\r\nto keep our broadside to her, lest the flag of truce should be a\r\ndeception.\" But being now satisfied of her good faith, Flinders brought\r\nhis ship to the wind on the opposite tack, had a boat hoisted out, and\r\nprepared to go on board the French vessel.\r\n\r\nAs Flinders did not speak French, he took with him Robert Brown, who was\r\nan accomplished French scholar. On board Le Geographe they were received\r\nby an officer, who indicated Baudin, and the three passed into the\r\ncaptain's cabin.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that Baudin, in his letter to the Minister of Marine, makes\r\nno reference to the presence of Brown at this interview, and at a second\r\nwhich occurred on the following morning. He speaks of inviting Flinders\r\nto enter his cabin, and proceeds to allude to the conversation which\r\nfollowed when they were \"alone\" (\"nous trouvant seul\"). But Flinders'\r\nstatement, \"as I did not understand French, Mr. Brown, the naturalist,\r\nwent with me in the boat; we were received by an officer who pointed out\r\nthe commander, and by him were conducted into the cabin,\" can have no\r\nother meaning than that Brown was present. He also says, further on in\r\nhis narrative, \"no person was present at our conversations except Mr.\r\nBrown, and they were mostly carried on in English, which the captain\r\nspoke so as to be understood.\" It may be that Baudin regarded Brown\r\nmerely as an interpreter, but certainly his presence was a fact.\r\n\r\nIn the cabin Flinders produced his passport from the French Government,\r\nand asked to see Baudin's from the Admiralty. Baudin found the document\r\nand handed it to his visitor, but did not wish to see the passport\r\ncarried by Flinders. He put it aside without inspection.\r\n\r\nThe conversation then turned upon the two voyages. Flinders explained\r\nthat he had left England about eight months after the departure of the\r\nFrench ships, and that he was bound for Port Jackson. Baudin related the\r\ncourse of his voyage, mentioning his work in Van Diemen's Land, his\r\npassage through Bass Strait, and his run along the coast of what is now\r\nthe State of Victoria, where he had not found \"any river, inlet or other\r\nshelter which afforded anchorage.\" Flinders enquired about a large island\r\nsaid to lie in the western entrance to Bass Strait (that is, King\r\nIsland), but Baudin said he had not seen it, and seemed to doubt whether\r\nit existed. Baudin observed in his letter that Flinders appeared to be\r\npleased with this reply, \"doubtless in the hope of being able to make the\r\ndiscovery himself.\"\r\n\r\nBaudin was very critical about an English chart of Bass Strait, published\r\nin 1800. He found fault with the representation of the north side, but\r\ncommended the drawing of the south side, and of the neighbouring islands.\r\nFlinders pointed to a note upon the chart, explaining that it was\r\nprepared from material furnished by George Bass, who had merely traversed\r\nthe coast in a small open boat, and had had no good means of fixing the\r\nlatitude and longitude; but he added that a rectified chart had since\r\nbeen published, and offered, if Baudin would remain in the neighbourhood\r\nduring the night, to visit Le Geographe again in the morning, and bring\r\nwith him a copy of this improved drawing, with a memorandum on the\r\nnavigation of the strait. He was alluding to his own small quarto book of\r\nObservations, published before he left England, as related in Chapter 12.\r\nBaudin accepted the offer with pleasure, and the two ships lay near\r\ntogether during the night.\r\n\r\nThe story of the interviews, as related by the two captains, is not in\r\nagreement on several points, and the differences are not a little\r\ncurious. Baudin states that he knew Flinders at the very beginning of the\r\nfirst interview, on April 8th: \"Mr. Flinders, who commanded the ship,\r\npresented himself, and as soon as I learnt his name I had no doubt that\r\nhe, like ourselves, was occupied with the exploration of the south coast\r\nof New Holland.\" But Flinders affirms that Baudin did not learn his name\r\nuntil the end of the second interview on April 9th: \"At parting...on my\r\nasking the name of the captain of Le Naturaliste he bethought himself to\r\nask mine; and finding it to be the same as the author of the chart which\r\nhe had been criticising, expressed not a little surprise, but had the\r\npoliteness to congratulate himself on meeting me.\" There may well have\r\nbeen some misunderstanding between the two captains, especially as\r\nFlinders did not speak French and Baudin only spoke English \"so as to be\r\nunderstood,\" which, as experience teaches, usually means so as to be\r\nmisunderstood. It is not very likely that Baudin was unaware of the name\r\nof the English captain until the end of the second meeting. While the\r\ninterview of April 8th was taking place in the cabin, Flinders' boatmen\r\nwere questioned by some of Le Geographe's company who could speak\r\nEnglish, and Peron tells us that the men related the story of the\r\nInvestigator's voyage.* (* Peron, Voyage de Decouvertes 1 323. Flinders\r\nalso said that \"some of his officers learnt from my boat's crew that our\r\nobject was also discovery.\") It is difficult to believe that Flinders'\r\nname would not be ascertained in this manner; equally difficult to\r\nbelieve that Captain Baudin would sustain two interviews with the\r\ncommander of another ship without knowing to whom he was talking. In\r\nfact, Baudin had the name of Flinders before him on the Bass Strait chart\r\nwhich he had been criticising. It was a chart copied in Paris from an\r\nEnglish print, and was inscribed as \"levee par Flinders.\" Baudin in his\r\nletter to the Minister observed that he pointed out to Flinders errors in\r\nthe chart \"that he had given us.\" Flinders was of opinion that Baudin\r\ncriticised the chart without knowing that he was the author of it. Baudin\r\nmay have been surprised at first to learn that the Captain Flinders with\r\nwhom he was conversing was the same as he whose name appeared on the\r\nchart; but his own statement that he knew the name at the first interview\r\nappears credible.\r\n\r\nAgain, Baudin was of opinion that at the first interview Flinders was\r\n\"reserved\"; whilst Flinders, on the other hand, was surprised that Baudin\r\n\"made no enquiries concerning my business on this unknown coast, but as\r\nhe seemed more desirous of communicating information I was happy to\r\nreceive it.\" Reading the two narratives together, it is not apparent\r\neither that Flinders wished to be reserved or that Baudin lacked\r\ncuriosity as to what the Investigator had been doing. The probable\r\nexplanation is that the two men were not understanding each other\r\nperfectly.\r\n\r\nAt half-past six o'clock on the morning of April 9th Flinders again\r\nvisited Le Geographe, where he breakfasted with Baudin.* (* Flinders does\r\nnot mention this circumstance; but as he boarded Le Geographe at 6.30 in\r\nthe morning and did not return to the Investigator till 8.30, Baudin's\r\nstatement is not doubtful.) On this occasion they talked freely about\r\ntheir respective voyages, and, said the French commodore, \"he appeared to\r\nme to have been happier than we were in the discoveries he had made.\"\r\nFlinders pointed out Cape Jervis, which was in sight, related the\r\ndiscovery of Spencer's and St. Vincent's Gulfs, and described Kangaroo\r\nIsland, with its abundance of fresh food and water. He handed to Baudin a\r\ncopy of his little book on Bass Strait and its accompanying chart,\r\nrelated the story of the loss of John Thistle and his boat's crew, and\r\nlistened to an account which his host gave of a supposed loss of one of\r\nhis own boats with a number of men on the east coast of Van Diemen's\r\nLand. Baudin intimated that it was likely that Flinders, in sailing east,\r\nwould fall in with the missing Naturaliste, and he requested that, should\r\nthis occur, the captain of that ship might be informed that Baudin\r\nintended to sail to Port Jackson as soon as the bad winter weather set\r\nin. Flinders himself had invited Baudin to sail to Sydney to refresh,\r\nmentioning that he would be able to obtain whatever assistance he\r\nrequired there. The interview was thoroughly cordial, and the two\r\ncaptains parted with mutual expressions of goodwill. Flinders and Brown\r\nreturned to the Investigator at half-past eight o'clock.\r\n\r\nSeaman Smith has nothing new to tell us concerning the Encounter Bay\r\nincident, but his brief reference is of some interest as showing how it\r\nstruck a member of the Investigator crew, and may be cited for that\r\npurpose. \"In the morning (9th April) we unmoord and stood for sea between\r\nVan Diemen's Land and New Holland. In the afternoon we espied a sail\r\nwhich loomd large. Cleared forequarters, not knowing what might be the\r\nconsequence. On the ship coming close, our captn spoke her. She proved to\r\nbe the Le Geography (sic) French ship upon investigation. Our boats being\r\nlowerd down our captn went on board of her, and soon returnd. Both ships\r\nlay to untill the next morning, when our captn went on board of her and\r\nsoon returnd. We found her poorly mannd, having lost a boat and crew and\r\nseveral that run away. Her acct. was that they had parted compy with the\r\nNaturalizer (sic) on investigation in a gale of wind. Have been from\r\nFrance 18 months. On the 20th we parted compy.\"\r\n\r\nBaudin sailed for Kangaroo Island, where his men enjoyed a similar feast\r\nto that which had delighted the English sailors a little while before.\r\nBut the scurvy-stricken condition of his crew made the pursuit of\r\nexploration painful, and he did not continue on these coasts beyond\r\nanother month. On May 8th he abandoned the work for the time being,\r\nresolving to pay a second visit to the region of the gulfs after he had\r\nrefreshed his people. Sailing for Sydney, he arrived there on June 20th,\r\nin circumstances that it will be convenient to relate after describing\r\nthe remainder of the voyage of the Investigator up to her arrival in the\r\nsame port.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16. FLINDERS IN PORT PHILLIP.\r\n\r\nFlinders' actual discovery work on the south coast was completed when he\r\nmet Baudin in Encounter Bay; for the whole coast line to the east had\r\nbeen found a short while before he appeared upon it, though he was not\r\naware of this fact when completing his voyage. For about a hundred and\r\nfifty miles, from the mouth of the Murray eastward to Cape Banks, the\r\ncredit of discovery properly belongs to Baudin, and Flinders duly marked\r\nhis name upon the chart. Further eastward, from Cape Banks to the deep\r\nbend of the coast at the head of which lies Port Phillip, the discoverer\r\nwas Captain Grant of the Lady Nelson. His voyage was projected under the\r\nfollowing circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip Gidley King, who in 1800 succeeded Hunter as Governor of New\r\nSouth Wales, was in England in 1799, he represented to the Admiralty the\r\ndesirability of sending out to Australia a small, serviceable ship,\r\ncapable of being used in shallow waters, so that she might explore bays\r\nand rivers. One of the Commissioners of the Transport Board, Captain John\r\nSchanck, had designed a type of vessel that was considered suitable for\r\nthis purpose. She was to be fitted with a sliding keel, or centreboard,\r\nand was deemed to be a boat of staunch sea-going qualities, as well as\r\nbeing good for close-in coastal service. A sixty-ton brig, the Lady\r\nNelson, was built to Schanck's plans, and was entrusted to the command of\r\nLieutenant Grant. She was tried in the Downs in January, 1800, when Grant\r\nreported enthusiastically on her behaviour. She rode out a gale in five\r\nfathoms of water without shipping \"even a sea that would come over the\r\nsole of your shoe.\" Running her into Ramsgate in a heavy sea, Grant wrote\r\nof her in terms that, though somewhat crabbed to a non-nautical ear, were\r\na sailor's equivalent for fine poetry: \"though it blew very strong, I\r\nfound the vessel stand well up under sail, and with only one reef out of\r\nthe topsails, no jib set, a lee tide going, when close hauled she brought\r\nher wake right aft and went at the rate of five knots.\"\r\n\r\nGrant was ambitious to make discoveries on his own account, and did not\r\nlack zeal. He was a skilful sailor, but was lacking in the scientific\r\naccomplishment required for the service in which he aspired to shine.\r\nWhen at length he returned from Australia, King summed him up in a\r\nsentence: \"I should have been glad if your ability as a surveyor, or\r\nbeing able to determine the longitude of the different places you might\r\nvisit, was any ways equal to your ability as an officer and a seaman.\"\r\n\r\nGrant left England early in 1800, intending to sail to Australia by the\r\nusual route, making the Cape of Good Hope, and then rounding the south of\r\nVan Diemen's Land. But news of the discovery of Bass Strait was received\r\nafter the Lady Nelson had put to sea; and the Admiralty (April, 1800)\r\nsent instructions to reach him at the Cape, directing him to sail through\r\nthe strait from the west. This he did. Striking the Australian coast\r\nopposite Cape Banks on December 3rd, 1800, he followed it along past Cape\r\nOtway, thence in a line across to Wilson's Promontory and, penetrating\r\nthe strait, was the first navigator to work through it from the far\r\nwestern side. He attempted no survey, and shortness of water and\r\nprovisions deterred him from even pursuing the in-and-out curves of the\r\nshore; but he marked down upon a rough eye-sketch such prominent features\r\nas Mount Gambier, Cape Northumberland, Cape Bridgewater, Cape Nelson,\r\nPortland Bay, Julia Percy Island, and Cape Otway. \"I took the liberty of\r\nnaming the different capes, bays, etc., for the sake of distinction,\" he\r\nreported to the Governor on his arrival at Sydney on December 16th.\r\n\r\nIt was in this way that both Baudin and Flinders were anticipated in the\r\ndiscovery of the western half of the coast of Victoria. The Investigator\r\nvoyage had not been planned when the Lady Nelson sailed; and when\r\nFlinders was commissioned the Admiralty directed that Grant should be\r\nplaced under his orders, the brig being used as a tender.\r\n\r\nThe baffling winds that had delayed Flinders' departure from Kangaroo\r\nIsland on April 8th, 1802, continued after he sailed from Encounter Bay,\r\nso that he did not pass the fifty leagues or so first traversed by Le\r\nGeographe for eight tedious days. On April 17th he reached Grant's Cape\r\nBanks; on April 18th passed Cape Northumberland; and on the 19th Capes\r\nBridgewater, Nelson and Grant. But the south-west gale blew so hard\r\nduring this part of the voyage that, the coast trending south-easterly,\r\nit was difficult to keep the ship on a safe course; and Flinders\r\nconfessed that he was \"glad to miss a small part of the coast.\" Thick\r\nsqually weather prevented the survey being made with safety; and, indeed,\r\nit was rarely that the configuration of the land could be distinguished\r\nat a greater distance than two miles. On the 21st Flinders noticed a\r\nsubsidence of the sea, which made him conclude that he was to the\r\nwindward of the large island concerning which he had questioned Baudin.\r\nHe resolved to take advantage of a period when the close examination of\r\nthe mainland had become dangerous to determine the exact position of this\r\nisland, of whose whereabouts he had heard from sealers in 1799.\r\n\r\nThe south part of King Island had been found by the skipper of a sealing\r\nbrig, named Reid, in 1799, but the name it bears was given to it by John\r\nBlack, commander of the brig Harbinger, who discovered the northern part\r\nin January, 1801. Flinders was occupied for three days at King Island. On\r\nthe 24th, the wind having moderated, he made for Cape Otway. But it was\r\nstill considered imprudent to follow the shore too closely against a\r\nsouth-east wind; and on the 26th the ship ran across the water to Grant's\r\nCape Schanck.\r\n\r\nThe details of these movements are of some moment, for the ship was\r\nnearing the gates of Port Philip. \"We bore away westward,\" Flinders\r\nrecords, \"in order to trace the land round the head of the deep bight.\"\r\nIn view of the importance of the harbour which he was about to enter, we\r\nmay quote his own description of his approach to it, and his surprise at\r\nwhat he found:\r\n\r\n\"On the west side of the rocky point,* (* Point Nepean.) there was a\r\nsmall opening, with breaking water across it. However, on advancing a\r\nlittle more westward the opening assumed a more interesting aspect, and I\r\nbore away to have a nearer view. A large extent of water presently became\r\nvisible withinside, and although the entrance seemed to be very narrow,\r\nand there were in it strong ripplings like breakers, I was induced to\r\nsteer in at half-past one; the ship being close upon a wind and every man\r\nready for tacking at a moment's warning. The soundings were irregular,\r\nbetween 6 and 12 fathoms, until we got four miles within the entrance,\r\nwhen they shoaled quick to 2 3/4. We then tacked; and having a strong\r\ntide in our favour, worked to the eastward, between the shoal and the\r\nrocky point, with 12 fathoms for the deepest water. In making the last\r\nstretch from the shoal, the depth diminished from 10 fathoms quickly to\r\n3; and before the ship could come round, the flood tide set her upon a\r\nmud bank and she stuck fast. A boat was lowered down to sound; and,\r\nfinding the deep water lie to the north-west, a kedge anchor was carried\r\nout; and, having got the ship's head in that direction, the sails were\r\nfilled, and she drew off into 6 and 10 fathoms; and it being then dark,\r\nwe came to an anchor.\r\n\r\n\"The extensive harbour we had thus unexpectedly found I supposed must be\r\nWesternport; although the narrowness of the entrance did by no means\r\ncorrespond with the width given to it by Mr. Bass. It was the information\r\nof Captain Baudin, who had coasted along from thence with fine weather,\r\nand had found no inlet of any kind, which induced this supposition; and\r\nthe very great extent of the place, agreeing with that of Westernport,\r\nwas in confirmation of it. This, however, was not Westernport, as we\r\nfound next morning; and I congratulated myself on having made a new and\r\nuseful discovery. But here again I was in error. This place, as I\r\nafterwards learned at Port Jackson, had been discovered ten weeks before\r\nby Lieutenant John Murray, who had succeeded Captain Grant in the command\r\nof the Lady Nelson. He had given it the name of Port Phillip, and to the\r\nrocky point on the east side of the entrance that of Point Nepean.\"\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of Flinders that he allowed no expression of\r\ndisappointment to escape him, on finding that he had been anticipated by\r\na few weeks in the discovery of Port Phillip. Baudin, it will be\r\nremembered, observed the satisfaction felt by his visitor in Encounter\r\nBay, when he learnt that Le Geographe had not found King Island, because\r\nhe thought he would have the happiness of being the first to lay it down\r\nupon a chart. In this he had been forestalled by Black of the Harbinger;\r\nand now again he was to find that a predecessor had entered the finest\r\nharbour in southern Australia. Disappointment he must have felt; but he\r\nwas by no means the man to begrudge the success that had accrued to\r\nanother navigator. He made no remark, such as surely might have been\r\nforgiven to him, about the determining accidents of time and weather;\r\nthough it is but right for us to observe that, had the Investigator been\r\npermitted to sail from England when she was ready (in April, 1801)\r\ninstead of being delayed by the Admiralty officials till July, Port\r\nPhillip, as well as the stretch of coast discovered by Baudin, would have\r\nbeen found by Flinders. That delay was caused by nothing more than a\r\ntemporary illness of the Secretary of the Admiralty, Evan Nepean, whose\r\nname is commemorated in Point Nepean, one of the headlands flanking the\r\nentrance to the Port.\r\n\r\nA perfectly just recognition of the real significance of Flinders in\r\nsouthern exploration has led to his name being honoured and commemorated\r\neven with respect to parts where he was not the actual discoverer. It is\r\na function of history to do justice in the large, abiding sense,\r\ndiscriminating the spiritual potency of personalities that dominate\r\nevents from the accidental connection of lesser persons with them. In\r\nthat wider sense, Flinders was the true discoverer of the whole of the\r\nsouthern coast of Australia. He, of course, made no such claim; but we\r\nwho estimate the facts after a long lapse of years can see clearly that\r\nit was so. Only the patching up of the old Reliance kept him in Sydney\r\nwhile Bass was creeping round the coast to Westernport. Only the illness\r\nof an official and other trifling causes prevented him from discovering\r\nPort Phillip. It was the completion of his chart of Bass Strait, based\r\nupon his friend's memoranda, that led the Admiralty to direct Grant to\r\nsail through the strait from the west, and so enabled him to be the first\r\nto come upon the coast from Cape Banks to Cape Schanck. It was only the\r\ndelay before-mentioned and the contrary winds that hindered him from\r\npreceding Baudin along the fifty leagues that are credited to that\r\nnavigator.\r\n\r\nThus it is that although not a league of the coastline of Victoria is in\r\nstrict verity to be attributed to Flinders as discoverer, he is\r\nhabitually cited as if he were. Places are named after him, memorials are\r\nerected to him. The highest mountain in the vicinity of Port Phillip\r\ncarries on its summit a tablet celebrating the fact that Flinders entered\r\nthe port at the end of April, 1802; but there is nowhere a memorial to\r\nremind anyone that Murray actually discovered it in January of the same\r\nyear. The reason is that, while it is felt that time and circumstance\r\nenabled others to do things which must be inscribed on the historical\r\npage, the triumph that should have followed from skill, knowledge,\r\ncharacter, preparation and opportunities well and wisely used, was fairly\r\nearned by Flinders. The dates, not the merits, prevent their being\r\nclaimed for him. His personality dominates the whole group of\r\ndiscoveries. We chronicle the facts in regard to Grant, Baudin, Murray,\r\nand Bass, but we feel all the time that Flinders was the central man.\r\n\r\nNot being aware of Murray's good fortune in January, Flinders treated\r\nPort Phillip as a fresh discovery, and examined its approaches with as\r\nmuch thoroughness as his resources would allow. At this time, however,\r\nthe store of provisions was running low. The Investigator was forty weeks\r\nout from England, and re-equipment was fast becoming imperative. Her\r\ncommander had felt the urgency of his needs before he reached Port\r\nPhillip. He had seriously considered whether he should not make for\r\nSydney from King Island. \"I determined, however, to run over to the high\r\nland we had seen on the north side of Bass Strait, and to trace as much\r\nof the coast from thence eastward as the state of the weather and our\r\nremaining provisions could possibly allow.\"\r\n\r\nAs related in the passage quoted above, Flinders at first thought he had\r\nreached Westernport, though the narrowness of the entrance did not\r\ncorrespond with Bass's description of the harbour he had discovered four\r\nyears previously. But Baudin had told him that he found no port or\r\nharbour of any kind between Westernport and Encounter Bay. Consequently,\r\nit was all the more astonishing to behold this great sheet of blue water\r\nbroadening out to shores overlooked by high hills, and extending\r\nnorthward further than the eye could penetrate. It was not until the\r\nfollowing day, April 27th, that he found he was not in the port which his\r\nfriend had discovered in the whaleboat. Immediately after breakfast he\r\nrowed away from the ship in a boat, accompanied by Brown and Westall, to\r\nascend the bluff mountain on the east side which Murray had named\r\nArthur's Seat. From the top he was able to survey the landscape at a\r\nheight of a thousand feet; and then he saw the waters and islands of\r\nWesternport lying beneath him only a few miles further to the east,\r\nwhilst, to his surprise, the curves of Port Phillip were seen to be so\r\nextensive \"that even at this elevation its boundary to the northward\r\ncould not be distinguished.\"\r\n\r\nNext morning, April 28th, Flinders commenced to sail round the bay. But\r\nthe wind was slight and progress was slow; with his fast diminishing\r\nstore of provisions vexing his mind, he felt that he could not afford the\r\ntime for a complete survey. Besides, the lead showed many shallows, and\r\nthere was a constant fear of running the ship aground. He therefore\r\ndirected Fowler to take the Investigator back to the entrance, whilst, on\r\nthe 29th, he went with Midshipman Lacy, in a boat provisioned for three\r\ndays, to make a rapid reconnaissance of as much as could be seen in that\r\ntime. He rowed north-east nine miles from Arthur's Seat, reaching about\r\nthe neighbourhood of Mornington. Then he crossed to the western side of\r\nthe bay, and on the 30th traversed the opening of the arm at the head of\r\nwhich Geelong now stands.\r\n\r\nAt dawn on May 1st he landed with three of the boat's crew, for the\r\npurpose of ascending the highest point of the You-yang range, whose\r\nconical peaks, standing up purple against the evening sky, had been\r\nvisible when the ship first entered Port Phillip. \"Our way was over a low\r\nplain, where the water appeared frequently to lodge. It was covered with\r\nsmall-bladed grass, but almost destitute of wood, and the soil was clayey\r\nand shallow. One or two miles before arriving at the feet of the hills,\r\nwe entered a wood, where an emu and a kangaroo were seen at a distance;\r\nand the top of the peak was reached at ten o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the crest of this granite mountain he would command a superb view.\r\nTowards the north, in the interior, the dark bulk of Mount Macedon was\r\nseen; and all around lay a fertile, promising country, mile after mile of\r\ngreen pastures, as fair a prospect as the eye could wish to rest upon.\r\nThere can be little doubt that Flinders made his observations from the\r\nflat top of a huge granite boulder which forms the apex of the peak. \"I\r\nleft the ship's name,\" he says, \"on a scroll of paper deposited in a\r\nsmall pile of stones upon the top of the peak.\" He called it Station\r\nPeak, for the reason that he had made it his station for making\r\nobservations. In 1912 a fine bronze tablet was fastened on the eastern\r\nface of the boulder on which Flinders probably stood and worked.* (* It\r\nis much to be regretted that this very laudable mark of honour to his\r\nmemory was not effected without doing a thing which is contrary to a good\r\nrule and was repugnant to Flinders' practice. The name Station Peak was\r\nsought to be changed to Flinders' Peak, and those who so admirably\r\noccasioned the erection of the tablet managed to secure official sanction\r\nfor the alteration by its notification in the Victorian Government\r\nGazette. But nobody with any historical sense or proper regard for the\r\nfame of Flinders will ever call the mountain by any other name than\r\nStation Peak. It was his name; and names given by a discoverer should be\r\nrespected, except when there is a sound reason to the contrary, as there\r\nis not in this instance. As previously observed, Flinders never named any\r\ndiscovery after himself. Honour him by calling any other places after him\r\nby all means; the name Flinders for the Commonwealth Naval Base in\r\nWesternport is an excellent one, for instance. But his names for natural\r\nfeatures should not be disturbed.)\r\n\r\nThe boat was reached, after the descent of the mountain and the return\r\ntramp across the sodden flats, at three o'clock in the afternoon. The\r\nparty were very weary from this twenty-mile excursion, a feat requiring\r\nsome power of endurance, as one who has walked along the same route and\r\nclimbed Station Peak several times can testify; and especially hard on\r\nmen who were fresh from a long voyage. The party camped for the night at\r\nIndented Head, on the west side of the port, and on Sunday, May 2nd, they\r\nagain boarded the Investigator.\r\n\r\nThe ship was anchored under the shelter of the Nepean Peninsula, nearly\r\nopposite the present Portsea. On the way back Flinders shot \"some\r\ndelicate teal,\" near the piece of water which Murray had called Swan\r\nHarbour, and a few black swans were caught.\r\n\r\nPort Phillip has since become important as the seat of one of the great\r\ncities of the world, and its channels are used by commercial fleets\r\nflying every colour known to the trading nations. Scarcely an hour of the\r\nday goes by, but the narrow waters dividing the port from the ocean are\r\nchurned by the propellers of great ships. The imagination sets itself a\r\ntask in trying to realize those few days in May, 1802, when Flinders\r\ncalled it a \"useful but obscure port\" and when the only keels that lay\r\nwithin the bay were those of one small sloop at anchor near the entrance,\r\nand one tiny boat in which her captain was rowing over the surface and\r\nmaking a map of the outline. And if it is difficult for us to recapture\r\nthat scene of spacious solitude, it was quite impossible for Flinders to\r\nforesee what a century would bring forth. He recognised that the\r\nsurrounding country \"has a pleasing and in many places a fertile\r\nappearance.\" He described much of it as patently fit for agricultural\r\npurposes. \"It is in great measure a grassy country, and capable of\r\nsupporting much cattle, though much better calculated for sheep.\" It was,\r\nindeed, largely on his report that settlement was attempted at Port\r\nPhillip in 1803. But it is quaint, at this time of day, to read his\r\nremark that \"were a settlement made at Port Phillip, as doubtless there\r\nwill be some time hereafter, the entrance could be easily distinguished,\r\nand it would not be difficult to establish a friendly intercourse with\r\nthe natives, for they are acquainted with the effect of firearms, and\r\ndesirous of possessing many of our conveniences.\"\r\n\r\nSeaman Smith devotes a paragraph in his Journal to the visit to Port\r\nPhillip, and it may as well be quoted for its historical interest: \"On\r\nthe 28th we came to an anchor in a bay of very large size. Thinking there\r\nwas a good channel in a passage through, we got aground; but by good\r\nmanagement we got off without damadge. Here we caught a Shirk which\r\nmeasured 10 feet 9 inch in length; in girt very large. 29th the captn and\r\nboats went to investigate the interior part of the harbr for 3 days,\r\nwhile those on board imploy'd in working ship to get as near the mouth of\r\nthe harbr as possible. May 2nd our boat and crew came on board. Brought\r\nwith them 2 swanns and a number of native spears.\"\r\n\r\nAt daylight on May 3rd the Investigator dropped out of Port Phillip with\r\nthe tide. Westall, the artist, made a drawing of the heads from a\r\ndistance of 5 miles.\r\n\r\nAt dusk on Saturday, May 8th, she stood seven miles off the entrance to\r\nPort Jackson. Flinders was so thoroughly well acquainted with the harbour\r\nthat he tried to beat up in the night; but the wind was adverse, and he\r\ndid not pass the heads till one o'clock on the following day. At three\r\no'clock the ship was brought to anchor, and the long voyage of discovery,\r\nwhich had had larger results than any voyage since the great days of\r\nCook, was over. It had lasted nine months and nine days.\r\n\r\nThe horrors of scurvy were such a customary accompaniment of long voyages\r\nin those days that the condition of Flinders' company at the termination\r\nof this protracted navigation was healthy almost beyond precedent. But\r\nthis young captain had learnt how to manage a ship in Cook's school, and\r\nhad profited from his master's admonitions. Cook, in his Endeavour voyage\r\nof 1770 and 1771, brought his people through a protracted period at sea\r\nwith, \"generally speaking,\" freedom from scurvy, and showed how by\r\nscrupulous cleanliness, plenty of vegetable food, and anti-scorbutic\r\nremedies the dreadful distemper could be kept at bay. But, fine as Cook's\r\nrecord is in this respect, it is eclipsed by that of Flinders, who\r\nentered Port Jackson at the end of this long period aboard ship with an\r\nabsolutely clean bill of health. There is no touch of pride, but there is\r\na note of very proper satisfaction, in the words which he was able to\r\nwrite of this remarkable record:--\r\n\r\n\"There was not a single individual on board who was not on deck working\r\nthe ship into harbour; and it may be averred that the officers and crew\r\nwere, generally speaking, in better health than on the day we sailed from\r\nSpithead, and not in less good spirits. I have said nothing of the\r\nregulations observed after we made Cape Leeuwin. They were very little\r\ndifferent from those adopted in the commencement of the voyage, and of\r\nwhich a strict attention to cleanliness and a free circulation of air in\r\nthe messing and sleeping places formed the most essential parts. Several\r\nof the inhabitants of Port Jackson expressed themselves never to have\r\nbeen so strongly reminded of England as by the fresh colour of many\r\namongst the Investigator's ship's company.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the anchor was dropped, Flinders went ashore and reported\r\nhimself to Governor King, to whom he delivered his orders from the\r\nAdmiralty. He also reported to Captain Hamelin of Le Naturaliste, who had\r\nsought refuge in the port and had been lying there since April 24th, the\r\nintention of Baudin to bring round Le Geographe in due course. Then he\r\nset about making preparations for refitting the ship and getting ready\r\nfor further explorations.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 17. THE FRENCH AT PORT JACKSON: PERON THE SPY.\r\n\r\nThe condition of Le Geographe when she made her appearance outside Port\r\nJackson, on June 20th, 1802, was in striking and instructive contrast\r\nwith that of the Investigator on her entry forty-two days before.\r\nFlinders had not a sick man on board. His crew finished the voyage a\r\ncompany of bronzed, jolly, hearty sailors, fit for any service. Baudin,\r\non the contrary, had not a single man on board who was free from disease.\r\nHis men were covered with sores and putrid ulcers;\" the surgeon,\r\nTaillefer, found the duty of attending upon them revolting; they lay\r\ngroaning about the decks in misery and pain, and only four were available\r\nfor steering and management, themselves being reduced almost to the\r\nextremity of debility. \"Not a soul among us was exempt from the\r\naffliction,\" wrote the commandant in his journal.\r\n\r\nThe utmost difficulty had been experienced in working the vessel round\r\nthe south of Van Diemen's Land and up the east coast in tempestuous\r\nweather. Baudin obstinately refused, in the teeth of the urgent\r\nrecommendation of his officers, to sail through Bass Strait, and thus\r\nsave several days; though, as he had already negotiated the strait from\r\nthe east, he knew the navigation, and the distressful condition of his\r\npeople should have impelled him to choose a route which would take them\r\nto succour in the briefest period of time. He insisted on the longer\r\ncourse, and in consequence brought his ship to the very verge of\r\ndisaster, besides intensifying the sufferings of his crew. The voyage\r\nfrom the region of the gulfs to the harbour of refuge was full of pain\r\nand peril. Man after man dropped out. The sailors were unable to trim the\r\nsails properly; steersmen fell at the wheel; they could not walk or lift\r\ntheir limbs without groaning in agony. It was a plague ship that crept\r\nround to Port Jackson Heads in that month of storms:\r\n\r\n\"And as a full field charging was the sea,\r\nAnd as a cry of slain men was the wind.\"\r\n\r\nAll this bitter suffering was caused because, as the official historian\r\nof the expedition tells us, Baudin \"neglected the most indispensable\r\nprecautions relative to the health of the men.\" He disregarded\r\ninstructions which had been furnished with reference to hygiene, paid no\r\nheed to the experience of other navigators, and permitted practices which\r\ncould not but conduce to disease. His illustrious predecessor, Laperouse,\r\na true pupil of Cook, had conducted a long voyage with fine immunity from\r\nscurvy, and Baudin could have done the same had he possessed valid\r\nqualifications for his employment.\r\n\r\nThere is no satisfaction in dwelling upon the pitiful condition to which\r\nBaudin's people were reduced; but it is necessary to set out the facts\r\nclearly, because the visit paid by Le Geographe and Le Naturaliste to\r\nSydney, and what the French officers did there, is of the utmost\r\nimportance in relation to what happened to Flinders at a later date.\r\n\r\nBaudin brought his vessel up to the entrance to the harbour on June 20th,\r\nbut so feeble were his crew that they could not work her into port. It\r\nwas reported that a ship in evident distress was outside, and at once a\r\nboat's crew of Flinders' men from the Investigator was sent down to\r\nassist in towing her to an anchorage. \"It was grievous,\" Flinders said,\r\n\"to see the miserable condition to which both officers and men were\r\nreduced by scurvy, there being not more out of one hundred and seventy,\r\naccording to the Captain's account, than twelve men capable of doing\r\ntheir duty.\" Baudin's own journal says they were only four; but, whatever\r\nthe number may have been, even these were sick, and could only perform\r\nany kind of work under the whip of absolute necessity. All the sufferers\r\nwere attended with \"the most touching activity\" by the principal surgeon\r\nof the settlement, James Thomson.\r\n\r\nThe resources of Sydney at that time were slender, but such as they were\r\nGovernor King immediately placed them at the disposal of the French\r\ncommodore. The sick were removed to the hospital, permission was given to\r\npitch tents close to where the Investigator's were erected, at Cattle\r\nPoint on the east side of Sydney Cove,* and everything was done to extend\r\na cordial welcome to the visitors. (* Flinders, Voyage, 1 227. The\r\n\"Cattle Point\" of Flinders is the present Fort Macquarie, or Bennelong\r\nPoint, behind which Government House stands.) \"Although,\" wrote the\r\nGovernor to Baudin, \"last night I had the pleasure of announcing that a\r\npeace had taken place between our respective countries, yet a continuance\r\nof the war would have made no difference in my reception of your ship,\r\nand affording every relief and assistance in my power; and, although you\r\nwill not find abundant supplies of what are most requisite and acceptable\r\nto those coming off so long a voyage, yet I offer you a sincere welcome.\r\nI am much concerned to find from Monsieur Ronsard that your ship's\r\ncompany are so dreadfully afflicted with the scurvy. I have sent the\r\nNaval Officer with every assistance to get the ship into a safe\r\nanchorage. I beg you would give yourself no concern about saluting. When\r\nI have the honour of seeing you, we will then concert means for the\r\nrelief of your sick.\" That was, truly, a letter replete in every word of\r\nit with manly gentleness, generous humanity and hospitable warmth. The\r\nsame spirit was maintained throughout of the six months of the\r\nFrenchmen's stay at Port Jackson. King even reduced the rations of his\r\nown people in order that he might have enough to share with the\r\nstrangers. Fresh meat was so scarce in the colony that when the\r\nInvestigator arrived Flinders could not buy any for his men; but as soon\r\nas the French appeared, King, pitying their plight, at once ordered the\r\nslaughtering of some oxen belonging to the Government in order that they\r\nmight be fed on fresh food. Baudin was daily at the Governor's house,*\r\nand King entertained his officers frequently. (* Historical Records 4\r\n952.) His tact was as conspicuous as his good nature. Baudin was not on\r\ngood terms with some of his officers, and the Governor was made aware of\r\nthis fact. He conducted himself as host with a resourceful consideration\r\nfor the feelings of his quarrelsome guests. And as the Governor comported\r\nhimself towards them, so also did the leading people of Sydney. \"Among\r\nall the French officers serving in the division which I command,\" wrote\r\nBaudin, \"there is not one who is not, like myself, convinced of the\r\nindebtedness in which we stand to Governor King and the principal\r\ninhabitants of the colony for the courteous, affectionate, and\r\ndistinguished manner in which they have received us.\"\r\n\r\nNot only on the social side was this extreme kindness displayed. King did\r\neverything in his power to further the scientific purposes of the\r\nexpedition and to complete the re-equipment of Baudin's ships. Le\r\nGeographe required to be careened, and to have her copper lining\r\nextensively repaired. Facilities were at once granted for effecting these\r\nworks. Baudin, intending to send Le Naturaliste back to France with\r\nnatural history specimens and reports up to date, desired to purchase a\r\nsmall Australian-built vessel to accompany him on the remainder of his\r\nvoyage. King gave his consent, \"as it is for the advancement of science\r\nand navigation,\" and the Casuarina, a locally-built craft of between 40\r\nand 50 tons, was acquired for the purpose. The French men of science were\r\nassisted in making excursions into the country in prosecution of their\r\nresearches. Baudin refused the application of his geologist, Bailly, who\r\nwished to visit the Hawkesbury River and the mountains to collect\r\nspecimens and study the natural formation. The British, thereupon,\r\nfurnished him with boats, guides and even food for the journey, since his\r\nown commander declined to supply him. Peron, the naturalist, who\r\nafterwards wrote the history of the voyage, was likewise afforded\r\nopportunities for travelling in prosecution of his studies, and the\r\ndisreputable use which he made of the freedom allowed to him will\r\npresently appear.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to believe that any of the French officers, or the men\r\nof science on Baudin's staff, abused the hospitality so nobly extended to\r\nthem, with two exceptions. The conduct of the crew appears to have been\r\nexemplary. Baudin himself won King's confidence, and was not unworthy of\r\nit. His demeanour was perfectly frank. \"Entre nous,\" wrote King to Banks\r\nin May, 1803, \"he showed me and left with me all his journals, in which\r\nwere contained all his orders from the first idea of the voyage taking\r\nplace...He informed me that he knew of no idea that the French had of\r\nsettling on any part or side of this continent.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the two ships, on November 17th, a rumour came to\r\nthe Governor's ears that some of the French officers had informed\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Paterson that it was their intention to establish a\r\nsettlement on Dentrecasteaux Channel in the south of Van Diemen's Land.\r\nThe news occasioned grave anxiety to King, who immediately took steps to\r\nfrustrate any such plans. He sent acting-Lieutenant Robbins in the\r\nCumberland in pursuit of Baudin, informing him of what was alleged, and\r\ncalling upon him for an explanation. Baudin positively denied that he had\r\nentertained such an intention; and certainly he had not acted, after\r\nleaving Port Jackson, as if he had the design to lay the foundations of a\r\nsettlement at the place specified, for he had not sailed anywhere near\r\nsouthern Van Diemen's Land. He had made direct for King Island, and was\r\nquietly continuing his exploratory work when Robbins found him. This\r\nvague and unsubstantial rumour, which Paterson had not even taken the\r\ntrouble to report officially to the Governor when he heard it, was the\r\nonly incident with which Baudin was connected that gave King any cause to\r\ndoubt his perfect good faith; and Baudin's categorical denial of the\r\nallegation is fully confirmed by his diary and correspondence--now\r\navailable for study--which contain no particle of evidence to suggest\r\nthat the planting of a settlement, or the choice of a site for one, was a\r\npurpose of the expedition.\r\n\r\nBaudin's gratitude for King's hospitality was expressed in a cordial\r\npersonal letter, and also in an open letter which he addressed to the\r\nGovernors of the French colonies of Ile-de-France and Reunion. Twelve\r\ncopies of the letter were left in King's hands, to be given by him to the\r\ncaptain of any British ships that might have occasion to put in to any\r\nport in those colonies. Blanks were left in the letter, to be filled up\r\nby King, with the name of the captain to whom he might give a copy and\r\nthe name of the ship.* (* Mr. F.M. Bladen, in a note appended to a copy\r\nof this interesting letter, in the Historical Records of New South Wales,\r\nVolume 4 page 968 says: \"The letter was handed to Governor King by\r\nCommodore Baudin, in case it should be required, but was retained by King\r\namongst his papers, and never used. Had it been in the hands of Flinders\r\nwhen forced to touch at the Isle of France it might have prevented any\r\nquestion, real or pretended, as to his bona fides. Indeed, it is not\r\nunlikely that it was originally intended for Flinders.\" But, although the\r\nletter was not used by Flinders, Baudin gave a copy of it to General\r\nDecaen, Governor of Ile-de-France, when he called there on his homeward\r\nvoyage. The copy is now among Decaen's manuscripts at Caen, Volume 84.\r\nThe blanks are in it, as in King's copy. Decaen was therefore fully aware\r\nof the generous treatment accorded to his countrymen at Port Jackson.) In\r\nthis document, it will be noticed, Baudin was bespeaking from\r\nrepresentatives of his country in their own colonies such consideration\r\nas he had experienced from his British hosts at Sydney. The fulness of\r\nhis obligation could scarcely have been expressed in more thorough terms:\r\n\r\n\"The assistance we have found here, the kindness of Governor King towards\r\nus, his generous attentions for the recovery of our sick men, his love\r\nfor the progress of science, in short, everything seemed to have united\r\nto make us forget the hardships of a long and painful voyage, which was\r\noften impeded by the inclemency of the weather; and yet the fact of the\r\npeace being signed was unknown, and we only heard of it when our sick men\r\nhad recovered, our vessels had been repaired, our provisions shipped, and\r\nwhen our departure was near at hand. Whatever the duties of hospitality\r\nmay be, Governor King had given the whole of Europe the example of a\r\nbenevolence which should be known, and which I take a great pleasure in\r\npublishing.\r\n\r\n\"On our arrival at Port Jackson, the stock of wheat there was very\r\nlimited, and that for the future was uncertain. The arrival of 170 men\r\nwas not a happy circumstance at the time, yet we were well received; and\r\nwhen our present and future wants were known, they were supplied by\r\nshortening part of the daily ration allowed to the inhabitants and the\r\ngarrison of the colony. The Governor first gave the example. Through\r\nthose means, which do so great honour to the humane feelings of him who\r\nput them into motion, we have enjoyed a favour which we would perhaps\r\nhave experienced much difficulty in finding anywhere else.\r\n\r\n\"After such treatment, which ought in future to serve as an example for\r\nall the nations, I consider it my duty, as much out of gratitude as by\r\ninclination, to recommend particularly to you Mr. ---- commander of\r\nH.M.S. ----. Although he does not propose to call at the Isle of France,\r\nit may be possible some unforeseen circumstance might compel him to put\r\ninto port in the colony, the government of which is entrusted to you.\r\nHaving been a witness of the kind manner with which his countrymen have\r\ntreated us on every occasion, I hope he will be convinced by his own\r\nexperience that Frenchmen are not less hospitable and benevolent; and\r\nthen his mother-country will have over us the advantage only of having\r\ndone in times of war what happier times enabled us to return to her in\r\ntime of peace.\"\r\n\r\nThat letter has been quoted, and the circumstances attending Baudin's\r\narrival and stay at Sydney have been narrated with some fulness, in order\r\nto give particular point to the conduct of two members of his expedition,\r\nFrancois Peron and Lieutenant Louis de Freycinet. As will be seen from\r\nwhat follows, both of them used the latitude allowed to them while\r\nreceiving King's generous hospitality, to spy, to collect information for\r\nthe purpose of enabling an attack to be made upon Port Jackson, and to\r\nsupply it with mischievous intent to the military authorities of their\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nLe Naturaliste returned to Europe from King Island on December 8th. She\r\ntook with her all the natural history specimens collected up to that\r\ntime, and reports of the work done. Baudin, with Le Geographe and the\r\nCasuarina, spent six months longer in Australian waters, exploring\r\nSpencer's and St. Vincent's Gulfs, completing the chart of Kangaroo\r\nIsland, and making a second voyage along the coast. On July 7th, 1803, he\r\ndetermined to return to France. He reached Ile-de-France on August 7th,\r\nbecame seriously ill there, and died on September 16th. The Casuarina was\r\ndismantled, and Le Geographe, which stayed there for three months after\r\nher commander's death, arrived in France on March 24th, 1804.\r\n\r\nThe military Governor of Ile-de-France at this time was General Charles\r\nDecaen. As a later chapter will be devoted to his career and character,\r\nit is only necessary to say here that he was a dogged, strong-willed\r\nofficer, imbued with a deep-rooted hatred of British policy and power,\r\nand anxious to avail himself of any opportunity that might occur of\r\nstriking a blow at the rival of his own nation. Francois Peron very soon\r\nfound that the Governor was eager to get information that might, should a\r\nfavourable chance present itself, enable him to attack the British colony\r\nin Australia, and he lost no time in ministering to the General's\r\nbelligerent animosity.\r\n\r\nOn December 11th, 1804, four days before Le Geographe sailed for Europe,\r\nPeron furnished to Decaen a long report on Port Jackson, containing some\r\nvery remarkable statements.* (* Manuscripts, Decaen Papers Volume 92. The\r\ncomplete document is translated in appendix B to this volume.) He alleged\r\nthat the First Consul, Bonaparte, in authorising Baudin's expedition, had\r\ngiven to it a scientific semblance with the object of disguising its real\r\nintent from the Governments of Europe, and especially from the cabinet of\r\nGreat Britain. \"If sufficient time were available to me,\" said Peron, \"it\r\nwould be very easy to demonstrate to you that all our natural history\r\nresearches, extolled with so much ostentation by the Government, were\r\nmerely the pretext of its enterprise.\" The principal object was \"one of\r\nthe most brilliant and important conceptions,\" which would, if\r\nsuccessful, have made the Government for ever illustrious. The\r\nunfortunate circumstance was, however, Peron declared, that after so much\r\nhad been done to conduce to the success of these designs, the execution\r\nof them had been confided to a man utterly unsuited to conduct them to a\r\nsuccessful issue.\r\n\r\nThat there were such designs as those alleged by Peron is disclosed by no\r\nword in Napoleon's Correspondance; there is no suggestion of anything of\r\nthe kind in the papers communicated to Baudin by the Minister of Marine,\r\nor in Baudin's confidential reports to his Government. It is in the\r\nnature of a spy to flavour with his own conjectures the base fruit of his\r\nillicit inquisitions, and Peron knew that he was writing to a man greedy\r\nto obtain such material as he was ready to supply. There is no word from\r\nany other member of the expedition, except Freycinet, written before or\r\nafter, to support Peron's allegations; and it is extremely unlikely that,\r\nif the purpose he indicated had been the real one, he would have been the\r\nman to know about it. Peron had not originally been a member of the staff\r\nof the expedition. Baudin's ships had been equipped, their complement was\r\ncomplete, and they were lying at Havre in October, 1800, awaiting sailing\r\norders, when Peron sought employment. He had been a student under Jussieu\r\nat the Museum, and to that savant he applied for the use of his\r\ninfluence. Jussieu, with the aid of the biologist, Lacepede, secured an\r\nopportunity for Peron to read a paper before the Institute, expounding\r\nhis views as to research work which might be done in Australasia; the\r\nresult was that at almost the last moment he obtained appointment.* (*\r\nSee the biographies of Peron by Deleuze (1811) and Girard (1857).) He was\r\nnot in the confidence of Baudin, with whom he was on bad terms throughout\r\nthe voyage, and his hatred for whom continued relentlessly after the\r\nunfortunate captain's death. On the point in question, therefore, Peron\r\nis by no means a trustworthy witness. The very terms in which Baudin\r\nwrote of Sydney, in his confidential letter to the Minister of Marine,\r\nindicate that he was innocent of any knowledge of a secret purpose. If he\r\nhad known he would have referred to it here; and if he did not know of\r\none, Peron certainly did not. \"I believe it to be my duty,\" wrote Baudin,\r\n\"to warn you that the colony of Port Jackson ought to engage the\r\nattention of the Government and indeed of other European power also.\r\nPeople in France or elsewhere are very far from imagining that the\r\nEnglish, in the space of fourteen years, have been able to build up their\r\ncolony to such a degree of prosperity, which will be augmented every year\r\nby the dispositions of their Government. It seems to me that policy\r\ndemands (il me semble que la politique exige) that by some means the\r\npreparations they are making for the future, which foreshadow great\r\nprojects, ought to be balanced.\" That was simply Baudin's personal\r\nopinion: \"it seemed to him.\" But the statement Peron made to Decaen, as\r\nto what he could demonstrate \"if he had time,\" together with his other\r\nassertions, may have had an influence on the general's mind, and may have\r\naffected the later treatment of Flinders; and that constitutes its\r\nimportance for our purpose.\r\n\r\nPeron went on to allege that while he was at Port Jackson, \"I neglected\r\nno opportunity of procuring all the information that I foresaw would be\r\nof interest. I was received in the house of the Governor with much\r\nconsideration; he himself and his secretary spoke our language well. Mr.\r\nPaterson, the commandant of the New South Wales troops, always treated me\r\nwith particular regard. I was received in his house, as one may say, like\r\na son. Through him I knew all the officials of the colony. The surgeon,\r\nMr. Thomson, honoured me with his friendship. Mr. Grimes, the\r\nsurveyor-general, Mr. Palmer the commissary-general, Mr. Marsden a\r\nclergyman at Parramatta, and a cultivator as wealthy as he was\r\ndiscerning, were all capable of furnishing me with valuable information.\r\nMy functions permitted me to hazard the asking of a number of questions\r\nwhich would have been indiscreet on the part of another, especially on\r\nmilitary matters. I have, in a word, known all the principal people of\r\nthe colony, in all walks of life, and all of them have furnished me with\r\ninformation as valuable as it is new. Finally, I made in Mr. Paterson's\r\ncompany long journeys into the interior of the country; I have seen the\r\nbest farms, and I assure you that I have collected everywhere interesting\r\nideas, and have stated them in as exact a form as possible.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this illuminating dissertation as to his own value as a spy, and\r\nthe clever use he had made of his functions as a naturalist to exploit\r\nunsuspecting people, Peron proceeded to describe the British\r\nestablishment in detail. But he omitted to tell Decaen how kindly he and\r\nhis countrymen had been treated there; not a word had he to say on that\r\nsubject; no circumstance was mentioned that might tend to withhold an\r\nattack if a favourable chance for one should occur. He gave an\r\ninteresting description of Sydney and its environs, spoke of the growth\r\nof its trade, the spread of cultivation, the increase of wealth. Then he\r\ngave his views on the designs of the British to extend their power in the\r\nPacific. Their ambitions were not confined to New Holland itself, vast as\r\nit was. Their cupidity had been excited by Van Diemen's Land. They did\r\nnot intend, if they could avoid it, to permit any other nation to occupy\r\nthat country. They would soon extend their dominion to New Zealand. They\r\nwere even casting avaricious glances across the Pacific. They had\r\noccupied Norfolk Island, and he did not hesitate to say that they were\r\nlooking for a place further east, whence they might assail Chili and\r\nPeru. The British were quite aware of the feebleness of the Spaniards in\r\nthose regions, and meant to appropriate their possessions in time.\r\n\r\nNext Peron gave an account of the transportation system, of which he\r\napproved, as making for rapid colonization, and as having valuable\r\nreformatory effects. The climate and productiveness of New South Wales\r\nwere enthusiastically praised by him, and its eminent suitability for\r\nEuropean occupation was extolled. In all that the British had done in\r\nAustralia were to be recognised great designs for the future. Steps had\r\nbeen taken to convert felons into good colonists, to educate their\r\nchildren, and to train them for useful avocations.\r\n\r\nHe drew attention to the number of Irish prisoners who had been\r\ntransported for participation in rebellious movements at home, and to\r\ntheir implacable hatred of Great Britain. \"The Irish, kept under by an\r\niron sceptre, are quiet to-day; but if ever the Government of our\r\ncountry, alarmed by the rapidly increasing power of that colony, formed\r\nthe project of taking or destroying it, at the very name of the French\r\nthe Irish would rise. We had a striking example of what might be expected\r\non our first arrival in the colony. Upon the appearance of the French\r\nflag, the alarm became general in the country. The Irish began to flock\r\ntogether from all parts, and if their error had not been speedily\r\ndissipated, there would have been a general rising among them. One or two\r\nwere put to death on that occasion, and several were deported to Norfolk\r\nIsland.\"\r\n\r\nThe troops at Port Jackson, said Peron, did not number more than 700 or\r\n800 men while the French ships were there, but he believed that as many\r\nas 8,000 were expected. He doubted, however, whether Great Britain could\r\nmaintain a very large force there, in view of the demands upon her\r\nresources elsewhere owing to the war; but was of opinion that she would\r\nuse Port Jackson as a depot for India, on account of the healthiness of\r\nthe climate. He summed up in eighteen paragraphs the advantage which\r\nGreat Britain drew, and was likely to draw, from her possession of Port\r\nJackson; and he terminated these by telling Decaen that \"my opinion, and\r\nthat of all those among us who have been particularly occupied with the\r\norganization of that colony, would be that we should destroy it as soon\r\nas possible. To-day we can do that easily; we shall not be able to do it\r\nin a few years to come.\" There followed a postscript in which Peron\r\ninformed the General that Lieutenant de Freycinet \"has particularly\r\noccupied himself with examining all the points on the coast in the\r\nneighbourhood of Port Jackson that are favourable for the debarkation of\r\ntroops. He has made especial enquiries concerning the entry to the port,\r\nand if ever the Government thought of putting into execution the project\r\nof destroying this freshly set trap of a great Power, that distinguished\r\nofficer's services would be of precious value in such an operation.\" The\r\nrecommendation of Peron's fellow-spy at the end of the report is\r\ninteresting, as indicating how the pair worked together. Peron, under the\r\nguise of a man of science collecting facts about butterflies and\r\ngrasshoppers, exploited his hosts for information of a political and\r\nmilitary nature; whilst Freycinet, ostensibly examining the harbour in\r\nthe interest of navigation, made plans of places suitable for landing\r\ntroops. Both together, having been nourished and nursed in their day of\r\ndire calamity by the abundant kindness of the people of Sydney, concocted\r\nplans for bringing destruction upon their benefactors, and proffered\r\ntheir services to show the way. One thinks perforce of a rough speech of\r\nDol Common in Ben Jonson's Alchemist:\r\n\r\n\"S'death, you perpetual curs,\r\nFall to your couples again, and cozen kindly.\"\r\n\r\nFive days after the arrival of Le Geographe in France, on March 29th,\r\n1804, Peron wrote to the Minister of Marine* in similar terms, relating\r\nthe valuable opportunities he had had of making himself acquainted with\r\nthe situation of Port Jackson, and mentioning the names of leading\r\ncitizens with whom he had associated, and from whom he had collected\r\ninformation. (* Arch. Nat. BB4 996.)\r\n\r\nA second report upon Port Jackson was furnished to General Decaen, giving\r\nprecise information as to where troops could be landed if an invasion\r\nwere undertaken. The document is unsigned,* but, having regard to Peron's\r\nstatement concerning Freycinet's investigations, there can be no doubt\r\nthat the information came from him. (* \"Coup d'oeil rapide sur\r\nl'establissement des Anglais de la Nouvelle Hollande,\" manuscripts,\r\nDecaen Papers Volume 92 page 74.) The writer described Sydney as \"perhaps\r\nthe most beautiful port in the world,\" and observed that, though its\r\nnatural defences were strong, the English had employed no means to\r\nfortify the approaches. Many of the convicts were Irish, and were capable\r\nof everything except good.* (* \"Ils sont capable de tout, excepte le\r\nbien.\") Persons who had played a part in connection with the recent\r\nrebellion in Ireland were subject to transportation, and were naturally a\r\ndisaffected class. England had only 600 troops to maintain order in that\r\n\"society of brigands,\" and discipline was not very well observed amongst\r\nthem. Particulars were given as to how an invasion could be effected:\r\n\r\n\"The conquest of Port Jackson would be very easy to accomplish, since the\r\nEnglish have neglected every species of means of defence. It would be\r\npossible to make a descent through Broken Bay, or even through the port\r\nof Sydney itself; but in the latter case it would be necessary to avoid\r\ndisembarking troops on the right side of the entrance, on account of the\r\narm of the sea of which I have already spoken.* (* Middle Harbour.) That\r\nindentation presents as an obstacle a great fosse, defended by a battery\r\nof ten or twelve guns, firing from eighteen to twenty-four-pound balls.\r\nThe left shore of the harbour is undefended, and is at the same time more\r\naccessible. The town is dominated by its outlying portions to such an\r\nextent, that it might be hoped to reduce the barracks in a little time.\r\nThere is no battery, and a main road leads to the port of Sydney. Care\r\nought to be taken to organize the invaders in attacking parties. The\r\naboriginals of the country need not be reckoned with. They make no\r\ndistinctions between white men. Moreover, they are few in numbers. The\r\nresidence of the Governor, that of the colonel of the New South Wales\r\nRegiment, the barracks, and one public building, are the principal\r\nedifices. The other houses, to the number of three or four hundred, are\r\nsmall. The chief buildings of the establishment captured, the others\r\nwould fall naturally into the hands of the conqueror. If the troops had\r\nto retreat, they would best do so by the River Oxbury* (* i.e., the\r\nHawkesbury; the Frenchman guessed at the spelling from the\r\npronunciation.) and thence to Broken Bay. I regret very much that I have\r\nnot more time to give* to this slight review of the resources, means of\r\ndefence of and methods of attack on that colony. I conclude by observing\r\nthat scarcely any coinage is to be found in circulation there. They use a\r\ncurrency of copper with which they pay the troops, and some paper money.\"\r\n(* Compare Peron's remark concerning the little time at his disposal.\r\nBoth reports were written only a few days before Le Geographe left\r\nIle-de-France for Europe.)\r\n\r\nThere is no need to emphasise the circumstances in which this piece of\r\nduplicity was perpetrated. They are made sufficiently clear from the\r\nplain story related in the preceding pages. But it should be said in\r\njustice to Baudin that there is no reason to associate him with the\r\nespionage of Peron. Nor is it the case that the expedition originally had\r\nany intention of visiting Port Jackson, for this or any other purpose. As\r\nexplained in the chapter relating to the Encounter Bay incident, it was\r\nFlinders who suggested to Baudin that he should seek the succour he so\r\nsorely needed at Sydney; and Le Naturaliste, which preceded him thither,\r\nwas driven by a like severity of need to his own. \"It does not appear by\r\nhis orders,\" wrote King to Banks \"that he was at all instructed to touch\r\nhere, which I do not think he intended if not obliged by distress.\" Such\r\nwas the case; and it was this very distress, and the generous alleviation\r\nof it by the British colonists, that make the singular turpitude of Peron\r\nand Freycinet in pursuing nefarious designs of their own and plotting to\r\nrend the breast that fed them. The great war gave rise to many noble acts\r\nof chivalry on both sides, deeds which are luminous with a spirit\r\ntranscending the hatreds of the time, and glorify human nature; but it is\r\nhappily questionable whether it produced an example to equal that\r\nexpounded in these pages, of ignoble treachery and ungrateful baseness.\r\n\r\nFlinders, when reviewing the unjust account of his own discoveries given\r\nby Peron in his Voyage de Decouvertes, adopted the view that what he\r\nwrote was under compulsion from authority. \"How came M. Peron to advance\r\nwhat was so contrary to truth?\" he asked. \"Was he a man destitute of all\r\nprinciple? My answer is that I believe his candour to have been equal to\r\nhis acknowledged abilities; and that what he wrote was from over-ruling\r\nauthority, and smote him to the heart.\" Could Flinders have known what\r\nPeron was capable of doing, in the endeavour to advance himself in favour\r\nwith the rulers of his country, he would certainly not have believed him\r\nso blameless.\r\n\r\nThat Port Jackson was never attacked during these years of war was not\r\ndue to its own capabilities of defence, which were pitifully weak; nor to\r\nreluctance on the part of Napoleon and Decaen; but simply to the fact\r\nthat the British Navy secured and kept the command of the sea. In 1810\r\nNapoleon directed the equipment of a squadron to \"take the English colony\r\nof Port Jackson, where considerable resources will be found.\"* (*\r\nNapoleon's Correspondance Volume 20 document 16 544.) But it was a futile\r\norder to give at that date. Trafalgar had been fought, and the defence of\r\nthe colony in Australia was maintained effectively wherever British\r\nfrigates sailed.\r\n\r\nPeron's report, then, did no mischief where he intended that it should.\r\nBut by inflaming Decaen's mind with suspicions it may not have been\r\nineffectual in another unfortunate direction, as we shall presently see.\r\n\r\nThe action of Peron in trying to persuade Decaen that the object of\r\nBaudin's expedition was not truly scientific was all the more remarkable\r\nbecause he himself, as one of its expert staff, did work which earned him\r\nmerited repute. His papers on marine life, on phosphorescence in the sea,\r\non the zoology of the South Seas, on the temperature of the sea at\r\nmeasured depths, and on other subjects pertaining to his scientific\r\nfunctions, were marked by conspicuous originality and acumen. But he was\r\nnot content to allow the value of his services to be estimated by\r\nresearches within his own sphere. He knew the sort of information that\r\nwould please General Decaen, and evidently considered that espionage\r\nwould bring him greater favour from his Government, at that time, than\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is right to bring out the fact, in justice to the\r\ndiligent savants who worked under Baudin, that their researches generally\r\nwere of real importance. Professor Jussieu, one of the foremost men of\r\nscience in Europe, was deputed to report upon them, and did so in a\r\ncomprehensive document.* (* Manuscripts, Archives of the Museum\r\nd'Histoire Naturelle de Paris.) \"Of all the collections which have come\r\nto us from distant countries at different times,\" wrote Jussieu, \"those\r\nwhich Le Geographe and Le Naturaliste have brought home are certainly the\r\nmost considerable.\" The botanist Leschenalt had found over 600 species of\r\nplants which were believed to be new to science; and he eulogised the\r\nzoological work of Peron, who had succeeded in bringing to France alive\r\nseven kinds of kangaroo, an emu, a lyre-bird and several black swan.\r\nAltogether, 18,414 specimens of Australian fauna had been collected,\r\ncomprised in 3872 species, of which 2592 species were new to the museum.\r\nThe men of science had \"succeeded beyond all our hopes.\" Their task had\r\nbeen perfectly fulfilled, and their services to science deserved to be\r\nliberally rewarded by a just and generous government.\r\n\r\nIt would have been a source of satisfaction if it could be recorded that\r\nwork so laborious and so well performed had earned for Peron a reputation\r\nunstained by such conduct as has been exhibited in the preceding pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 18. AUSTRALIA CIRCUMNAVIGATED.\r\n\r\nPreparations for the continuance of researches in the Investigator\r\nproceeded speedily during June and July, 1802. Friendly relations were\r\nmaintained with the staff of the French ships, who on one occasion dined\r\non board with Flinders, and were received with a salute of eleven guns. A\r\nnew chart of the south coast was then shown to Baudin, with the part\r\nwhich he had discovered marked with his name. He made no objection to the\r\njustice of the limits indicated, though he expressed himself surprised\r\nthat they were so small; for up to this time he was not aware of the\r\ndiscovery by Grant of the coast eastward from Cape Banks. \"Ah, Captain,\"\r\nsaid Freycinet, when he recognised the missed opportunities, \"if we had\r\nnot been kept so long picking up shells and catching butterflies at Van\r\nDiemen's Land, you would not have discovered the south coast before us.\"\r\n\r\nA glimpse of the social life of the settlement is afforded in a letter to\r\nMrs. Flinders, concerning the King's birthday celebrations.* (* Flinders'\r\nPapers.) Very little is known about the amusements and festivities of\r\nSydney in those early days, but that gaiety and ceremony were not absent\r\nfrom the convict colony is apparent from this epistle, which was dated\r\nJune 4th, 1802: \"This is a great day in all distant British settlements,\r\nand we are preparing to celebrate it with due magnificence. The ship is\r\ncovered with colours, and every man is about to put on his best apparel\r\nand to make himself merry. We go through the form of waiting on His\r\nExcellency the Governor at his levee, to pay our compliments to him as\r\nthe representative of majesty; after which, a dinner and ball are given\r\nto the colony, at which not less than 52 gentlemen and ladies will be\r\npresent. Amidst all this, how much preferable is such a 'right hand and\r\nleft' as that we have had at Spilsby with those we love, to that which we\r\nshall go through this evening.\"\r\n\r\nA few alterations were made in the ship, which was re-rigged and\r\noverhauled; and a new eight-oar boat was built to replace the one lost in\r\nSpencer's Gulf. She cost 30 pounds, and was constructed after the model\r\nof the boat in which Bass had made his famous expedition to Westernport.\r\nShe proved, \"like her prototype, to be excellent in a sea, as well as for\r\nrowing and sailing in smooth water.\"\r\n\r\nFourteen men were required to make up the ship's complement. A new master\r\nwas found in John Aken of the Hercules, a convict transport, and five\r\nseamen were engaged; but it was impossible to secure the services of nine\r\nothers from amongst the free people. Flinders thereupon proposed to the\r\nGovernor that he should ship nine convicts who could bring \"respectable\r\nrecommendations.\" King concurred, and the number required were permitted\r\nto join the Investigator, with the promise that they should receive\r\nconditional or absolute pardons on their return, \"according to Captain\r\nFlinders' recommendation of them.\" Several of them were experienced\r\nseamen, and proved a great acquisition to the strength of the ship.\r\nFlinders also took with him his old friend Bongaree, \"the worthy and\r\nbrave fellow\" who had accompanied him on the Norfolk voyage in 1799, and\r\na native lad named Nambaree.\r\n\r\nIt was determined, after consultation with King, to sail to the north of\r\nAustralia and explore Torres Strait and the east side of the Gulf of\r\nCarpentaria, as well as to examine the north-east coast with more care\r\nthan Cook had been able to give to it. The Lady Nelson, under Murray's\r\ndirection, was to accompany the Investigator; if rivers were found, it\r\nwas hoped that she would be able to penetrate the country by means of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st July the provisioning of the ship was completed, the new boat\r\nwas hoisted into her place, and the Investigator dropped down the harbour\r\nto make her course northward.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Nelson proved more of a hindrance than a help to the work of\r\nexploration. She was painfully slow, and, to make matters worse, Murray,\r\n\"not being much accustomed to make free with the land,\" hugged the coast,\r\nand kept the Investigator waiting for him at every appointed rendezvous.\r\nIn August she bumped on a reef in Port Curtis and lost her sliding keel;\r\nin September she ran aground in Broad Sound and injured her main keel.\r\nHer capacity for beating to windward was never great, and after she had\r\nbeen repaired her tardiness became irritating. Murray had also lost one\r\nanchor and broken another. His ship sailed so ill, in fact, and required\r\nso much attention, that she dragged on Flinders' vessel; and Murray had\r\ngiven many proofs that he \"was not much acquainted with the kind of\r\nservice\" in which they were engaged. On October 18th, therefore, Flinders\r\nsent her back to Sydney, with an expression of regret at depriving\r\nMurray, who had shown zeal to make himself useful, of the advantage of\r\ncontinuing the voyage.\r\n\r\nOn August 7th Port Curtis was discovered, and was named after Sir Roger\r\nCurtis, the admiral at the Cape who had been so attentive to the\r\nrequirements of the Investigator on her voyage out from England. In\r\nKeppel Bay (discovered by Cook in 1770) the master's mate and a seaman\r\nbecame bogged in a mangrove swamp, and had to pass the night persecuted\r\nby clouds of mosquitoes. In the morning their plight was relieved by a\r\nparty of aboriginals, who took them to a fire whereat they dried\r\nthemselves, and fed them on broiled wild duck. Natives were encountered\r\nat every landing-place, and were invariably friendly.\r\n\r\nAnother important discovery was made on August 21st, when Port Bowen was\r\nentered. It had not only escaped Cook's notice, but, owing to a change of\r\nwind, was nearly missed by Flinders also. He named it after Captain James\r\nBowen of the Royal Navy.\r\n\r\nIn every bay he entered Flinders examined the refuse thrown up by the\r\nsea, with the object of finding any particle of wreckage that might have\r\nbeen carried in. If, as was commonly believed (and was, in fact, the\r\ncase), Laperouse had been wrecked somewhere in the neighbourhood of New\r\nCaledonia, it was possible that remnants of his vessels might be borne to\r\nthe Queensland coast by the trade winds. \"Though the hope of restoring\r\nLaperouse or any of his companions to their country and friends could\r\nnot, after so many years, be rationally entertained, yet to gain some\r\ncertain knowledge of their fate would do away the pain of suspense.\"* (*\r\nIn 1861, remains of a small vessel were found at the back of Temple\r\nIsland, not far from Mackay, 150 miles or more north of Flinders'\r\nsituation when he wrote this passage. The wreckage is believed by some to\r\nbe part of the craft built by Laperouse's people at Vanikoro, after the\r\ndisaster which overtook them there. The sternpost recovered from the\r\nwreckage is, I am informed, included among the Laperouse relics preserved\r\nat Paris. See A.C. Macdonald, on \"The Fate of Laperouse,\" Victorian\r\nGeographical Journal 26 14.)\r\n\r\nThe Percy Islands (September 28th) were a third discovery of importance\r\non this northern voyage. Flinders now desired to find a passage through\r\nthe Barrier Reef to the open Pacific, in order that he might make the\r\nutmost speed for Torres Strait and the Gulf of Carpentaria. Several\r\nopenings were tried. At length an opening was found. It is known as\r\nFlinders' Passage, in latitude 18 degrees 45 minutes south, longitude 148\r\ndegrees 10 minutes east, and is frequently used nowadays. It is about 45\r\nmiles north-east from Cape Bowling Green, and is the southernmost of the\r\npassages used by shipping through the Barrier. Three anxious days were\r\nspent in tacking through the intricacies of the untried passage. The\r\nperplexity and danger of the navigation must have recalled to the\r\ncommander's mind his experiences as a midshipman under Bligh ten years\r\nbefore. It was not until the afternoon of October 20th that a heavy swell\r\nfrom the eastward was felt under the ship, and Flinders knew by that sign\r\nthat the open sea had been gained. He finished his description of this\r\ntreacherous piece of reef-ribbed sea by a bit of seaman's advice to\r\nbrother sailors. A captain who wished to make the experiment of getting\r\nthrough the Barrier Reef \"must not be one who throws his ship's head\r\nround in a hurry so soon as breakers are announced from aloft. If he do\r\nnot feel his nerves strong enough to thread the needle, as it is called,\r\namongst the reefs, while he directs the steerage from the masthead, I\r\nwould strongly recommend him not to approach this part of the coast.\"\r\nStrong nerves and seamanship had pulled through in this case, with a few\r\nexciting phases; and the Investigator, in the open ocean, was headed for\r\nTorres Strait.\r\n\r\nThe strait was entered eight days later, by a passage through the reef\r\nwhich had been found by Captain Edwards of the Pandora in 1791, and which\r\nFlinders marked on his chart as Pandora's Entrance.* (* It is generally\r\nmarked Flinders' Entrance on modern maps; but Flinders himself held to\r\nhis principle of never calling a place after himself, and of invariably\r\nascribing full credit to his predecessors.) He preferred this opening to\r\nthe one further north, found by Bligh in 1792. The ship was brought to\r\nanchor on October 29th under the lee of the largest of Murray's Islands.\r\n\r\nImmediately afterwards three long Papuan canoes, carrying about fifty\r\nnatives, came in sight. Remembering the attacks he had witnessed in the\r\nProvidence, Flinders kept his marines under arms and his guns ready, and\r\nwarned his officers to watch every movement of the visitors. But the\r\nPapuans were merely bent on barter on this occasion, hatchets especially\r\nbeing in demand. Seven canoes appeared on the following morning. \"Wishing\r\nto secure the friendship and confidence of these islanders to such\r\nvessels as might hereafter pass through Torres Strait, and not being able\r\nto distinguish any chief amongst them, I selected the oldest man, and\r\npresented him with a handsaw, a hammer and nails, and some other trifles;\r\nof all which we attempted to show him the use, but I believe without\r\nsuccess; for the poor old man became frightened on finding himself to be\r\nso particularly noticed.\"\r\n\r\nDarwin, in writing his treatise on the Structure and Distribution of\r\nCoral Reefs, in 1842, made use of Flinders' chart and description of the\r\nGreat Barrier Reef, which extends for more than a thousand miles along\r\nthe east side of the continent, and into the throat of Torres Strait. The\r\nhypothesis that as the bed of the ocean subsides the coral polyps go on\r\nbuilding steadily upwards, occurred to Darwin more than thirty years\r\nafter Flinders sailed along the Reef; and what the navigator wrote was\r\nthe result of his own observation and thought. Many absurd and fanciful\r\nspeculations about coralline formation were current in his day, and have\r\noften been repeated since. But the reader who has given any study to\r\nDarwin's array of facts and powerful reasoning will be interested in the\r\nideas of the earlier observer:\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me, that, when the animalcules which form the corals at the\r\nbottom of the ocean cease to live, their structures adhere to each other,\r\nby virtue either of the glutinous remains within, or of some property in\r\nsalt water; and the interstices being gradually filled up with sand and\r\nbroken pieces of coral washed by the sea, which also adhere, a mass of\r\nrock is at length formed. Future races of these animalcules erect their\r\nhabitations upon the rising bank, and die in their turn, to increase, but\r\nprincipally to elevate, this monument of their wonderful labours. The\r\ncare taken to work perpendicularly in the early stages would mark a\r\nsurprising instinct in these diminutive creatures. Their wall of coral,\r\nfor the most part in situations where the winds are constant, being\r\narrived at the surface, affords a shelter to leeward of which their\r\ninfant colonies may be safely sent forth; and to their instructive\r\nforesight it seems to be owing that the windward side of a reef exposed\r\nto the open sea is generally, if not always, the highest part, and rises\r\nalmost perpendicular, sometimes from the depth of 200, and perhaps many\r\nmore fathoms. To be constantly covered with water seems necessary to the\r\nexistence of the animalcules, for they do not work, except in holes upon\r\nthe reef, beyond low-water mark; but the coral, sand, and other broken\r\nremnants thrown up by the sea adhere to the rock, and form a solid mass\r\nwith it, as high as the common tides reach. That elevation surpassed, the\r\nfuture remnants, being rarely covered, lose their adhesive property, and,\r\nremaining in a loose state, form what is usually called a key upon the\r\ntop of the reef. The new bank is not long in being visited by sea-birds;\r\nplants take root upon it; a cocoanut, or the drupe of a pandanus is\r\nthrown on shore; land-birds visit it and deposit the seeds of shrubs and\r\ntrees; every high tide, and still more every gale, adds something to the\r\nbank; the form of an island is gradually assumed; and last of all comes\r\nman to take possession.\"\r\n\r\nThe Gulf of Carpentaria was entered on November 3rd, and a suitable place\r\nwas found for careening the ship. As the carpenters proceeded with their\r\nwork, their reports became alarming. Many of her timbers were found to be\r\nrotten, and the opinion was confidently expressed that in a strong gale\r\nwith much sea running she could hardly escape foundering. She was totally\r\nunfit to encounter much bad weather. The formal report to the commander\r\nconcluded with the depressing warning, \"from the state to which the ship\r\nseems now to be advanced, it is our joint opinion that in twelve months\r\nthere will scarcely be a sound timber in her, but that, if she remain in\r\nfine weather and no accident happen, she may run six months longer\r\nwithout much risk.\"\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of this report Flinders, with much surprise and sorrow, saw\r\nthat a return to Port Jackson was almost immediately necessary. \"My\r\nleading object had hitherto been to make so accurate an investigation of\r\nthe shores of Terra Australis that no future voyage to this country\r\nshould be necessary; and with this always in view, I had ever endeavoured\r\nto follow the land so closely that the washing of the surf upon it should\r\nbe visible, and no opening, nor anything of interest, escape notice. Such\r\na degree of proximity is what navigators have usually thought neither\r\nnecessary nor safe to pursue, nor was it always persevered in by us;\r\nsometimes because the direction of the wind or shallowness of the water\r\nmade it impracticable, and at other times because the loss of the ship\r\nwould have been the probable consequence of approaching so near to a lee\r\nshore. But when circumstances were favourable, such was the plan I\r\npursued, and, with the blessing of God, nothing of importance should have\r\nbeen left for future discoverers upon any part of these extensive coasts;\r\nbut with a ship incapable of encountering bad weather, which could not be\r\nrepaired if sustaining injury from any of the numerous shoals or rocks\r\nupon the coast--which, if constant fine weather could be ensured and all\r\naccidents avoided, could not run more than six months--with such a ship I\r\nknew not how to accomplish the task.\"\r\n\r\nVery serious consideration had to be given to the route by which the\r\nreturn voyage should be made. If Flinders returned as he had come, the\r\nmonsoon season made it certain that storms would be encountered in Torres\r\nStrait, and to thread the Barrier Reef in a rotten ship in tempestuous\r\nweather was to court destruction. Weighing the probabilities carefully\r\nFlinders, with a steady nerve and cool judgment, resolved to continue his\r\nexploration of the gulf until the monsoon abated, and then to make for\r\nPort Jackson round the north-west and west of Australia--or, if it should\r\nappear that the Investigator could not last out a winter's passage by\r\nthis route, to run for safety to the nearest port in the East Indies. In\r\nthe meantime all that the carpenters could do was to replace some of the\r\nrottenest parts of the planking and caulk the bends.\r\n\r\nFlinders remained on these coasts, in pursuit of his plan, till the\r\nbeginning of March, doing excellent work. The Cape Van Diemen of Dutch\r\ncharts, at the head of the gulf, was found to be not a projection from\r\nthe mainland but an island, which was named Mornington Island, after the\r\nGovernor-General of India; and the group of which it is the largest\r\nreceived the designation of Wellesley Islands* after the same nobleman.\r\n(* Richard, Earl of Mornington, afterwards the Marquess Wellesley, was\r\nGovernor-General of India from 1798 to 1805.) The Sir Edward Pellew\r\ngroup, discovered on the south-west of the gulf, was named after a\r\nBritish admiral who will figure in a later part of this biography.\r\n\r\nTraces of the visits of Malays to this part of Australia were found in\r\nthe form of fragments of pottery, bamboo basket-work, and blue cotton\r\nrags, as well as a wooden anchor and three boat rudders. The Cape Maria\r\nof Dutch charts was found to be an island, which received the name of\r\nMaria Island. In Blue Mud Bay, Morgan, the master's mate, was speared by\r\na native, and died. A seaman shot another native in revenge, and Flinders\r\nwas \"much concerned\" and \"greatly displeased\" about the occurrence. His\r\npolicy throughout was to keep on pleasant terms with all natives, and to\r\nencourage them to look upon white men as friendly. Nothing that could\r\nannoy them was countenanced by him at any time. The incident was so\r\nunusual a departure from his experience on this voyage as to set him\r\nconjecturing that the natives might have had differences with Asiatic\r\nvisitors, which led them to entertain a common enmity towards foreigners.\r\n\r\nMelville Bay, the best harbour near the gulf, was discovered on February\r\n12th, and on the 17th the Investigator moved out of the gulf and steered\r\nalong the north coast of Australia. Six Malay vessels were sighted on the\r\nsame day. They hung out white flags as the English ship approached and\r\ndisplayed her colours; and the chief of one of them came on board. It was\r\nfound that sixty prows from Macassar were at this time on the north\r\ncoast, in several divisions; they were vessels of about twenty-five tons,\r\neach carrying about twenty men; their principal business was searching\r\nfor beche-de-mer, which was sold to the Chinese at Timor.\r\n\r\nArnhem Bay was found marked, but not named, upon an old Dutch chart, and\r\nFlinders gave it the name it bears from the conviction that Tasman or\r\nsome other navigator had previously explored it. In the early part of\r\nMarch he came to the conclusion that it would be imprudent to delay the\r\nreturn to Sydney any longer. Not only did the condition of the ship cause\r\nanxiety, but the health of the crew pointed to the urgency of quitting\r\nthese tropical coasts. Mosquitoes, swarms of black flies, the debility\r\ninduced by the moist heat of the climate, and the scarcity of nourishing\r\nfood, made everybody on board anxious to return. Scorbutic ulcers broke\r\nout on Flinders' feet, so that he was no longer able to station himself\r\nat his customary observation-point, the mast-head. Nevertheless, though\r\ndriven by sheer necessity, it was not without keen regret that he\r\ndetermined to sail away. \"The accomplishment of the survey was, in fact,\"\r\nhe said, \"an object so near to my heart, that could I have foreseen the\r\ntrain of ills that were to follow the decay of the Investigator and\r\nprevent the survey being resumed, and had my existence depended upon the\r\nexpression of a wish, I do not know that it would have received\r\nutterance; but Infinite Wisdom has, in infinite mercy, reserved the\r\nknowledge of futurity to itself.\"\r\n\r\nEven in face of the troubles facing him, Flinders fought hard to continue\r\nhis work to a finish. He planned to make for the Dutch port of Kupang, in\r\nTimor, and thence send Lieutenant Fowler home in any ship bound for\r\nEurope to take to the Admiralty his reports and charts, and a scheme for\r\ncompleting the survey. He hoped then to spend six months upon the north\r\nand north-west coasts of Australia, and on the run to Port Jackson, and\r\nthere to await Fowler's return with a ship fit for the service. But this\r\nplan was frustrated. He reached Timor at the end of March, and was\r\ncourteously received by the Dutch Governor, also renewing acquaintance\r\nwith Baudin and his French officers, who had put into port to refresh.\r\nBut no ship bound for England was met. A homeward-bound vessel from India\r\nhad touched at Kupang ten days before the Investigator arrived, but when\r\nanother one would put in was uncertain. A vessel was due to sail for\r\nBatavia in May, and the captain consented to take charge of a packet of\r\nletters for transmission to England; but there was no opportunity of\r\nsending Fowler. A few days were spent in charting a reef about which the\r\nAdmiralty had given instructions, and by April 16th the voyage to Port\r\nJackson was being pursued at best speed by way of the west and south\r\ncoasts. Flinders did not even stay to examine the south of Kangaroo\r\nIsland, which had not been charted during the visit in 1802, for\r\ndysentery made its appearance on board--owing, it was believed, to a\r\nchange of diet at Timor--and half a dozen men died. Sydney was reached on\r\nJune 9th, after a voyage of ten months and nineteen days.\r\n\r\nAustralia had thus been, for the first time, completely circumnavigated\r\nby Flinders.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the Investigator showed how perilously near destruction\r\nshe had been since she left the Gulf of Carpentaria. On the starboard\r\nside some of the planks were so rotten that a cane could be thrust\r\nthrough them. By good fortune, when she was running along the south coast\r\nthe winds were southerly, and the starboard bow, where the greatest\r\nweakness lay, was out of the water. Had the wind been northerly, Flinders\r\nwas of opinion that it would not have been possible to keep the pumps\r\ngoing sufficiently to keep the ship afloat, whilst a hard gale must\r\ninevitably have sent her to the bottom.\r\n\r\nAs Flinders said in a letter to his wife:* (* Flinders' Papers.) \"It was\r\nthe unanimous opinion of the surveying officers that, had we met with a\r\nsevere gale of wind in the passage from Timor, she must have crushed like\r\nan egg and gone down. I was partly aware of her bad state, and returned\r\nsooner to Port Jackson on that account before the worst weather came. For\r\nme, whom this obstruction in the voyage and the melancholy state of my\r\npoor people have much distressed, I have been lame about four months, and\r\nmuch debilitated in health and I fear in constitution; but am now\r\nrecovering, and shall soon be altogether well.\" In another letter he\r\ndescribes the ship as \"worn out--she is decayed both in skin and bone.\"\r\n\r\nOf the nine convicts who were permitted to make this voyage, one died;\r\nthe conduct of a second did not warrant Flinders in recommending him for\r\na pardon; the remaining seven were fully emancipated. Four sailed with\r\nFlinders on his next voyage; but two of them, no longer having to gain\r\ntheir liberty by good behaviour, conducted themselves ill, and a third\r\nwas convicted again after he reached England.\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival in port after this voyage Flinders learnt of the death\r\nof his father. The occasion called forth a letter to his step-mother,\r\nwhich is especially valuable from the light it throws upon his\r\ncharacter.* (* Flinders' Papers.) The manly tenderness of his sorrow and\r\nsympathy throbs through every sentence of it. In danger, in adversity, in\r\ndisappointment, in difficulty, under tests of endurance and throughout\r\nperilous cruises, we always find Flinders solicitous for the good of\r\nothers and unsparing of himself; and perhaps there is no more moving\r\nrevelation of his quality as a man than that made in this letter:\r\n\r\n\"Investigator, Port Jackson, June 10th, 1803.\r\n\r\n\"My dearest Mother,\r\n\r\n\"We arrived here yesterday from having circumnavigated New Holland, and I\r\nreceived numerous and valuable marks of the friendship of all those whose\r\naffection is so dear to me; but the joy which some letters occasioned is\r\ndreadfully embittered by what you, my good and kind mother, had occasion\r\nto communicate. The death of so kind a father, who was so excellent a\r\nman, is a heavy blow, and strikes deep into my heart. The duty I owed\r\nhim, and which I had now a prospect of paying with the warmest affection\r\nand gratitude, had made me look forward to the time of our return with\r\nincreased ardour. I had laid such a plan of comfort for him as would have\r\ntended to make his latter days the most delightful of his life; for I\r\nthink an increased income, retirement from business, and constant\r\nattention from an affectionate son whom he loved, would have done this.\r\nIndeed, my mother, I thought the time fast approaching for me to fulfil\r\nwhat I once said in a letter, that my actions should some day show how I\r\nvalued my father. One of my fondest hopes is now destroyed. O, my\r\ndearest, kindest father, how much I loved and reverenced you, you cannot\r\nnow know!\r\n\r\n\"I beg of you, my dear mother, to look upon me with affection, and as one\r\nwho means to contribute everything in his power to your happiness.\r\nIndependent of my dear father's last wish, I am of myself desirous that\r\nthe best understanding and correspondence should exist between us; for I\r\nlove and reverence you, and hope to be considered by you as the most\r\nanxious and affectionate of your friends, whose heart and purse will be\r\never ready for your services.\r\n\r\n\"I know not who at present can receive my dividend from his legacy to me;\r\nbut if you can, or either Mr. Franklin or Mr. Hursthouse, I wish the\r\nyearly interest to be applied to the education of my young sisters,* (*\r\nHis step-sisters.) in such manner as you will think best. This, my dear\r\nMadam, I wish to continue until such time as I can see you and put things\r\nupon the footing that they ought to remain.\r\n\r\n\"Do not let your economy be carried too far. I hope you will continue to\r\nvisit and see all our good friends, and have things comfortable about\r\nyou. I should be sorry that my dear mother should lose any of the\r\ncomforts and conveniences she has been accustomed to enjoy.\r\n\r\n\"I have much satisfaction in hearing both from you and Susan that Hannah*\r\n(* The elder of his two step-sisters.) makes so good use of the\r\nopportunities she has for improvement. If she goes on cultivating her\r\nmind, forming her manners from the best examples before her, and behaves\r\nrespectfully and kindly to her mother and elder friends, she shall be my\r\nsister indeed, and I will love her dearly.\r\n\r\n\"With great regard for you and my young sisters, I am your anxious and\r\naffectionate son,\r\n\r\n\"MATTHEW FLINDERS.\"\r\n\r\nIn another vein is a playful letter to his wife written in the same\r\nmonth, June, 1803.* (* Flinders' Papers.)\r\n\r\n\"If I could laugh at the effusion of thy tenderness, it would be to see\r\nthe idolatrous language thou frequently usest to me. Thou makest an idol\r\nand then worshippest it, and, like some of the inhabitants of the East,\r\nthou also bestowest a little castigation occasionally, just to let the\r\nugly deity know the value of thy devotion. Mindest thou not, my dearest\r\nlove, that I shall be spoiled by thy endearing flatteries? I fear it, and\r\nyet can hardly part with one, so dear to me is thy affection in whatever\r\nway expressed.\"\r\n\r\nSome account of his companions on the voyage is given in a letter to Mrs.\r\nFlinders written at this time (June 25th, 1803).* (* Flinders' Papers.)\r\nIn a letter previously quoted he had referred to being debilitated in\r\nhealth, \"and I fear in constitution\"; and in this one he mentions that\r\nhe, like the ship's cat, Trim, was becoming grey. Such hard unsparing\r\nservice as he had given was writing its tale on his form and features,\r\nand there were worse trials to come: \"Mr. Fowler is tolerably well and my\r\nbrother is also well; he is becoming more steady, and is more friendly\r\nand affectionate with me since his knowledge of our mutual loss. Mr.\r\nBrown is recovering from ill health and lameness. Mr. Bauer, your\r\nfavourite, is still polite and gentle. Mr. Westall wants prudence, or\r\nrather experience, but is good-natured. The two last are well, and have\r\nalways remained on good terms with me. Mr. Bell* (* The surgeon.) is\r\nmisanthropic and pleases nobody. Elder* (* Flinders' servant.) continues\r\nto be faithful and attentive as before; I like him, and he apparently\r\nlikes me. Whitewood I have made a master's mate, and he behaves well.\r\nCharrington is become boatswain, and Jack Wood is now my coxswain. Trim,\r\nlike his master, is becoming grey; he is at present fat and frisky, and\r\ntakes meat from our forks with his former dexterity. He is commonly my\r\nbedfellow. The master we have in poor Thistle's place* (* John Aken.) is\r\nan easy, good-natured man.\" In another letter to his wife* (* Flinders'\r\nPapers.) he tells her: \"Thou wouldst have been situated as comfortably\r\nhere as I hoped and told thee. Two better or more agreeable women than\r\nMrs. King and Mrs. Paterson are not easily found. These would have been\r\nthy constant friends, and for visiting acquaintances there are five or\r\nsix ladies very agreeable for short periods and perhaps longer.\"\r\n\r\nIn a previous chapter it was remarked that Flinders and Bass did not meet\r\nagain after their separation following on the Norfolk voyage. Bass was\r\nnot in Sydney when the Investigator lay there, greatly to Flinders'\r\ndisappointment. \"Fortune seems determined to give me disappointments,\" he\r\nwrote to Mrs. Kent; \"when I came into Port Jackson all the most esteemed\r\nof my friends were absent. In the case of Bass I have been twice served\r\nthis way.\"* But he left a letter for his friend with Governor King.* (*\r\nFlinders' Papers.) It was the last word which passed between these two\r\nmen; and, remembering what they did together, one can hardly read the end\r\nof the letter without feeling the emotion with which it was penned:\r\n\r\n\"I shall first thank you, my dear Bass, for the two letters left for me\r\nwith Bishop, and then say how much I am disappointed that the speculation\r\nis not likely to afford you a competency so soon as we had hoped. This\r\nfishing and pork-carrying may pay your expenses, but the only other\r\nadvantage you get by it is experience for a future voyage, and this I\r\ntake to be the purport of your Peruvian expedition.\r\n\r\n\"Although I am so much interested in your success, yet what I say about\r\nit will be like one of Shortland's letters, vague conjectures only,\r\nmingled with 'I hope'. Concerning the Investigator and myself, there will\r\nbe more certainty in what I write. In addition to the south coast, we\r\nhave explored the east coast as far as Cape Palmerston, with the islands\r\nand extensive reefs which lie off. These run from a little to the\r\nnorth-west of Breaksea Spit to those of the Labyrinth. The passage\r\nthrough Torres Straits you will learn as much of here as I can tell you.\r\nThe newspaper of June 12 last will give you information enough to go\r\nthrough, and it is the best I have (the chart excepted) until the strait\r\nis properly surveyed. Should these three ships go through safely, and I\r\ndo not fear the contrary, the utility of the discovery will be well\r\nproved, and the consequences will probably be as favourable to me as the\r\nCONCLUSION of the voyage might have been without it. I do indeed\r\nprivately hope that, whether the voyage is or is not further prosecuted,\r\nI may attain another step; many circumstances are favourable to this, but\r\nthe peace and the non-completion of the voyage are against it. To balance\r\nthese, I must secure the interest of the India House, by means of Sir\r\nJoseph, Mr. Dalrymple, and the owner of the Bridgewater, Princeps, with\r\nwhom I am acquainted. I am fortunate in having the attachment of Governor\r\nKing, who by introductions, favourable reports, and I believe every\r\nproper means in his power, has, and is still, endeavouring to assist me;\r\nand you are to understand that my going home for another ship is in\r\nconformity to an opinion first brought forward by him. The shores of the\r\nGulf of Carpentaria have undergone a minute examination.\r\n\r\n\"It might appear that the presence of the French upon these coasts would\r\nbe much against me; but I consider that circumstance as favourable,\r\ninasmuch as the attention of the world will be more strongly attracted\r\ntowards New Holland, and some comparisons will no doubt be found between\r\nour respective labours. Now, in the department of geography, or rather\r\nhydrography, the only one where the execution rests with me, they seem to\r\nhave been very vague and inconclusive, even by their own testimony. By\r\ncomparison, therefore, my charts will rise in value. It is upon these\r\nthat I wish to rest my credit. You must, however, make the requisite\r\nallowance for the circumstances under which each part was examined, and\r\nthese circumstances I have made the charts themselves explain, I hope to\r\nyour satisfaction, as you will see on publication.\r\n\r\n\"I shall see your wife, if in London, as well as her family. Accounts\r\nspeak indifferently of her brother* and his prospects. (* Captain Henry\r\nWaterhouse.) His sun seems to have passed the meridian, if they speak\r\ntrue. Your good mother I shall endeavour to see too, if my business will\r\nanyway fit it.\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, my dear Bass; remember me, and believe me to be,\r\n\r\n\"Your very sincere and affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n\"MATTHEW FLINDERS.\"\r\n\r\nOne other letter of this period may be quoted for the insight it gives\r\ninto the relations between the Governor and the principal residents of\r\nthe colony at this time. The urbanity and good sense of Flinders, and the\r\nfact that his voyages kept him out of the official circle for prolonged\r\nperiods, enabled him to avoid offence under such circumstances. The\r\nletter was written to Captain Kent's wife, a treasured friend:\r\n\r\n\"The attention of the Governor to me has been indeed very great, as well\r\nas that which I have received from my kind friend, Mrs. King. It is a\r\ncause of much uneasiness to me that Colonel and Mrs. P---* (* The quarrel\r\nbetween King and Paterson was bitter, and affected the affairs of the\r\ncolony in many directions.) should be upon terms of disagreement with\r\n----. There is now Mrs. K---,* (* King.) Mrs. P---* (* Paterson.) and\r\nMrs. M---,* (* Marsden.) for all of whom I have the greatest regard. who\r\nscarcely speak to each other. It is really a miserable thing to split a\r\nsmall society into such small parts. Why do you ladies meddle with\r\npolitics? But I do not mean YOU.\"\r\n\r\nWhat subsequently happened to the Investigator, a ship which had played\r\nso memorable a part in discovery, may be chronicled in a few lines. She\r\nwas used as a store ship in Sydney harbour till 1805. In that year she\r\nwas patched sufficiently to take her to England. Captain William Kent\r\ncommanded her on the voyage, leaving Sydney on May 24th. She arrived in\r\nLiverpool in a shattered condition on October 24th, having been driven\r\npast the Channel in a storm. The Admiralty ordered Kent to take her round\r\nto Plymouth. He carried out the order, but not without great difficulty.\r\n\"A more deplorably crazy vessel than the Investigator is perhaps not to\r\nbe seen,\" Kent informed the Admiralty on reaching Falmouth. She was sold\r\nand broken up in 1810. But those rotten planks had played a part in\r\nhistory, and if only a few splinters of them remained to-day they would\r\nbe preserved with the tenderest reverence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 19. THE CALAMITY OF WRECK REEF.\r\n\r\nThere was some anxious discussion between King and Flinders as to the\r\nbest course to follow for the expeditious completion of the survey of the\r\ncoasts of Australia. The Investigator being no longer fit for the\r\nservice, consideration was given to the qualifications of the Lady\r\nNelson, the Porpoise, the Francis, and the Buffalo, all of which were\r\nunder the Governor's direction. King was most willing to give his\r\nconcurrence and assistance in any plan that might be considered\r\nexpedient. He confessed himself convinced of Flinders' \"zealous\r\nperseverance in wishing to complete the service you have so beneficially\r\ncommenced,\" and cheerfully placed his resources at the explorer's\r\ndisposal.\r\n\r\nFlinders went for a few days to the Hawkesbury settlement, where fresh\r\nair, a vegetable diet and medical care promoted his recovery from the\r\nailments occasioned by prolonged ship-life in the tropics; and on his\r\nreturn, at the beginning of July, determined upon a course of action. The\r\nPorpoise was the best of the four vessels mentioned, but she was by no\r\nmeans a sound ship, and it did not seem justifiable to incur the expense\r\nof fitting her for special service only to find her incapable of\r\nfinishing the task. It was determined, therefore, that she should be sent\r\nto England under Fowler's command, and that Flinders should go in her as\r\na passenger, in order that he might lay his charts and journals before\r\nthe Admiralty, and solicit the use of another vessel to continue his\r\nexplorations. Brown, the botanist,* and Bauer, the botanical draftsman.\r\ndesired to remain in Port Jackson to pursue their scientific work, but\r\nWestall accompanied Flinders, who with twenty-one of the remainder of the\r\nInvestigator's company, embarked on the Porpoise. (* Brown, in the\r\npreface to his Prodromus (which, being intended for the elect, was\r\nwritten in Latin), made but one allusion to the discovery voyage whereby\r\nhis botanical researches became possible. Dealing with the parts of\r\nAustralia where he had collected his specimens, he spoke of the south\r\ncoast, \"Oram meridionalem Novae Hollandiae, a promontorio Lewin ad\r\npromontorium Wilson in Freto Bass, complectentem Lewin's Land, Nuyt's\r\nLand et littora Orientem versus, a Navarcho Flinders in expeditione cui\r\nadjunctus fui, primum explorata, et paulo post a navigantibus Gallicis\r\nvisa: insulis adjacentibus inclusis.\") She sailed on August 10th, in\r\ncompany with the East India Company's ship Bridgewater and the Cato, of\r\nLondon, both bound for Batavia. It was intended to go north, and through\r\nTorres Strait, in order that further observations might be made there;\r\nand Fowler was ordered to proceed \"by the route Captain Flinders may\r\nindicate.\" Had not Flinders been so eager to take advantage of this as of\r\nevery other opportunity to prosecute his researches--had he sailed by the\r\nBass Strait and Cape of Good Hope route--the misfortunes that were soon\r\nto come upon him would have been averted. But he deliberately chose the\r\nTorres Strait course, not only because he considered that a quick passage\r\ncould be made at that season of the year, but chiefly for the reason that\r\n\"it will furnish me with a second opportunity of assuring myself whether\r\nthat Strait can or cannot become a safe general passage for ships from\r\nthe Pacific into the Indian Ocean.\"\r\n\r\nHe was destined to see once again the settlement at Sydney, whence had\r\nradiated the series of his valuable and unsparing researches; but on the\r\nnext and final occasion he was \"caught in the clutch of circumstance.\"\r\nHis leave-taking in August, 1803, was essentially his farewell; and his\r\ngeneral observations on the country he had served, and which does not\r\nforget the service, are, though brief, full of interest. He had seen the\r\nlittle town grow from a condition of dependence to one of self-reliance,\r\nfew as were the years of his knowledge of it. Part of his early\r\nemployment had been to bring provisions to Sydney from abroad. In 1803,\r\nhe saw large herds spreading over the country. He saw forests giving way\r\nbefore the axe, and spreading fields of grain and fruit ripening for the\r\nharvest. The population was increasing, the morale was improving, \"and\r\nthat energetic spirit of enterprise which characterises Britannia's\r\nchildren seemed to be throwing out vigorous shoots in this new world.\" He\r\nperceived the obstacles to progress. The East India Company's charter,\r\nwhich prohibited trade between Sydney and India and the western coasts of\r\nAmerica, was one of them. Convict labour was another deterrent. But he\r\nhad vision, and found in the signs of development which he saw around him\r\nphenomena \"highly interesting to the contemplator of the rise of\r\nnations.\"\r\n\r\nSeven days out of Sydney, on August 17th, the Porpoise struck a reef and\r\nwas wrecked.\r\n\r\nThe three vessels were running under easy sail, the Porpoise leading on\r\nwhat was believed to be a clear course. At half-past nine o'clock at\r\nnight the look-out man on the forecastle called out \"Breakers ahead.\"\r\nAken, the master, who was on watch, immediately ordered the helm to be\r\nput down, but the ship answered slowly. Fowler sprang on deck at once;\r\nbut Flinders, who was conversing in the gun-room, had no reason to think\r\nthat anything serious had occurred, and remained there some minutes\r\nlonger. When he went on deck, he found the ship beyond control among the\r\nbreakers, and a minute later she struck a coral reef and heeled over on\r\nher starboard beam ends. \"It was,\" says Seaman Smith, \"a dreadful shock.\"\r\nThe reef--now called Wreck Reef--was in latitude 22 degrees 11 minutes\r\nsouth, longitude 155 degrees 13 minutes east, about 200 miles north-east\r\nof Hervey Bay, and 739 miles north of Sydney.* (* Extract from the\r\nAustralia Directory Volume 2 (Published by the Admiralty): \"Wreck Reef,\r\non the central portion of which the ships Porpoise and Cato were wrecked\r\nin 1803, consists of a chain of reefs extending 18 1/2 miles and includes\r\n5 sand cays; Bird Islet, the easternmost, is the only one known to\r\nproduce any vegetation. Of the other four bare cays none are more than\r\n130 yards in extent, or exceed six feet above high water; they are at\r\nequal distances apart of about four miles, and each is surrounded by a\r\nreef one to one and a half miles in diameter. The passages between these\r\nreefs are about two miles wide...On the northern side of most of them\r\nthere is anchorage.\") The wind was blowing fresh, and the night was very\r\ndark. The heave of the sea lifted the vessel and dashed her on the coral\r\na second and third time; the foremast was carried away, and the bottom\r\nwas stove in. It was realised at once that so lightly built and unsound a\r\nship as the Porpoise was must soon be pounded to pieces under the\r\nrepeated shocks.\r\n\r\nAnxiety for the safety of the Cato and the Bridgewater was felt, as they\r\nwere following the lead of the King's vessel. An attempt was made to fire\r\na gun to warn them, but the heavy surf and the violent motion of the\r\nwrecked ship prevented this being done. Before any warning could be given\r\nthe Cato dashed upon the coral about two cables' length from the\r\nPorpoise, whose company saw her reel, fall over, and disappear from view.\r\nThe Bridgewater happily cleared the reef.\r\n\r\nAfter the first moments of confusion had passed, Flinders ordered the\r\ncutter and the gig to be launched. He informed Fowler that he intended to\r\nsave his charts and journals, and to row to the Bridgewater to make\r\narrangements for the rescue of the wrecked people. The gig, in which he\r\nattempted to carry out this plan, was compelled to lie at a little\r\ndistance from the ship, to prevent being stove in; so he jumped overboard\r\nand swam to her. She leaked badly, and there was nothing with which to\r\nbale her out but the hats and shoes of the ship's cook and two other men\r\nwho had taken refuge under the thwarts. Flinders steered towards the\r\nBridgewater's lights, but she was standing off, and it was soon seen to\r\nbe impossible to reach her. It was also unsafe to return to the Porpoise\r\nthrough the breakers in the darkness; so that the boat was kept on the\r\nwater outside the reef till morning, the small party on board being\r\ndrenched, cold under a sharp south-easter, and wretchedly miserable.\r\nFlinders did his best to keep up their spirits, telling them that they\r\nwould undoubtedly be rescued by the Bridgewater at daylight; but he\r\noccupied his own mind in devising plans for saving the wrecked company in\r\ncase help from that ship was not forthcoming.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile blue lights had been burnt on the ship every half-hour, as a\r\nguide to the Bridgewater, whose lights were visible till about two\r\no'clock in the morning. Fowler also occupied time in constructing a raft\r\nfrom the timbers, masts and yards of the Porpoise. \"Every breast,\" says\r\nSmith's narrative, \"was filled with horror, continual seas dashing over\r\nus with great violence.\" Of the Cato nothing could be seen. She had\r\nstruck, not as the Porpoise had done, with her decks towards the reef,\r\nbut opposed to the full force of the lashing sea. Very soon the planks\r\nwere torn up and washed away, and the unfortunate passengers and crew\r\nwere huddled together in the forecastle, some lashed to timber heads,\r\nothers clinging to any available means of support, and to each other,\r\nexpecting every moment that the stranded vessel would be broken asunder.\r\nIn Smith's expressive words, the people were \"hanging in a cluster by\r\neach other on board the wreck, having nothing to take to but the\r\nunmerciful waves, which at this time bore a dreadful aspect.\"\r\n\r\nAt dawn, Flinders climbed on to the Porpoise by the help of the fallen\r\nmasts. As the light grew, it was seen that about half a mile distant lay\r\na dry sandbank above high-water mark, sufficiently large to receive the\r\nwhole company, with such provisions as could be saved from the ship.\r\nOrders were at once given to remove to this patch, that gave promise of\r\ntemporary safety, everything that could be of any service; and the Cato's\r\ncompany, jumping overboard and swimming through the breakers with the aid\r\nof planks and spars, made for the same spot. All were saved except three\r\nlads, one of whom had been to sea on three or four voyages and was\r\nwrecked on every occasion. \"He had bewailed himself through the night as\r\nthe persecuted Jonah who carried misfortune wherever he went. He launched\r\nhimself upon a broken spar with his captain; but, having lost his hold in\r\nthe breakers, was not seen afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of the Bridgewater in these distressing circumstances was\r\ninhuman and discreditable to such a degree as is happily rare in the\r\nhistory of seamanship. On the day following the wreck (August 18th) it\r\nwould have been easy and safe for her captain, Palmer, to bring her to\r\nanchor in one of the several wide and sufficiently deep openings in the\r\nreef, and to take the wrecked people and their stores on board. Flinders\r\nhad the gig put in readiness to go off in her, to point out the means of\r\nrescue. A topsail was set up on the highest part of the reef, and a large\r\nblue ensign, with the union downwards, was hoisted to it as a signal of\r\ndistress. But Palmer, who saw the signal, paid no heed to it. Having\r\nsailed round the reef, deluding the unfortunates for a while with the\r\nfalse hope of relief, he stood off and made for Batavia, leaving them to\r\ntheir fate. Worse still, he acted mendaciously as well as with a\r\nheartless disregard of their plight; for on his arrival at Tellicherry he\r\nsent his third mate, Williams, ashore with an untrue account of the\r\noccurrence, reporting the loss of the Porpoise and Cato, and saying that\r\nhe had not only found it impossible to weather the reef, but even had he\r\ndone so it would have been too late to render assistance. Williams,\r\nconvinced that the crews were still on the reef, and that Palmer's false\r\naccount had been sent ashore to excuse his own shameful conduct, and\r\n\"blind the people,\" left his captain's narrative as instructed, but only\r\n\"after relating the story as contrary as possible\" on his own account. He\r\ntold Palmer what he had done, and his action \"was the cause of many\r\nwords.\" What kind of words they were can be easily imagined. The result\r\nof Williams' honest independence was in the end fortunate for himself.\r\nThough he left the ship, and forfeited his wages and part of his clothes\r\nby so doing, he saved his own life from drowning. The Bridgewater left\r\nBombay for London, and was never heard of again. \"How dreadful,\" Flinders\r\ncommented, \"must have been his reflections at the time his ship was going\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\nOn the reef rapid preparations were made for establishing the company in\r\nas much comfort as means would allow, and for provisioning them until\r\nassistance could be procured. They were 94 men \"upon a small\r\nuncertainty\"--the phrase is Smith's--nearly eight hundred miles from the\r\nnearest inhabited port. But they had sufficient food for three months,\r\nand Flinders assured them that within that time help could be procured.\r\nStores were landed, tents were made from the sails and put up, and a\r\nproper spirit of discipline was installed, after a convict-sailor had\r\nbeen promptly punished for disorderly conduct. Spare clothing was served\r\nout to some of the Cato's company who needed it badly, and there was some\r\nfun at the expense of a few of them who appeared in the uniforms of the\r\nKing's navy. With good humour came a feeling of hope. \"On the fourth\r\nday,\" wrote Flinders in a letter,* \"each division of officers and men had\r\nits private tent, and the public magazine contained sufficient provisions\r\nand water to subsist us three months. We had besides a quantity of other\r\nthings upon the bank, and our manner of living and working had assumed\r\nthe same regularity as on board His Majesty's ships. I had to punish only\r\none man, formerly a convict at Port Jackson; and on that occasion I\r\ncaused the articles of war to be read, and represented the fatal\r\nconsequences that might ensue to our whole community from any breach of\r\ndiscipline and good order, and the certainty of its encountering\r\nimmediate punishment.\" (* Flinders' Papers.)\r\n\r\nThe stores available,* with the periods for which they would suffice on\r\nfull allowance, consisted of:\r\nBiscuit, 940 pounds and Flour, 9644 pounds : 83 days.\r\nBeef in four pounds, 1776 pieces and Pork in two pounds, 592 pieces : 94\r\ndays.\r\nPease, 45 bushels : 107 days.\r\nOatmeal, 50 bushels : 48 days.\r\nRice, 1225 pounds : 114 days.\r\nSugar, 320 pounds and Molasses, 125 pounds : 84 days.\r\nSpirits, 225 gallons, Wine, 113 gallons and Porter, 60 gallons : 49 days.\r\nWater, 5650 gallons at half a gallon per day.\r\n\r\n(* Sydney Gazette, September 18th, 1803.)\r\n\r\nIn addition there were some sauer kraut, essence of malt, vinegar, salt,\r\na new suit of sails, some spars, a kedge anchor, iron-work and an\r\narmourer's forge, canvas, twine, various small stores, four-and-a-half\r\nbarrels of gunpowder, two swivels, and several muskets and pistols, with\r\nball and flints. A few sheep were also rescued. When they were being\r\ndriven on to the reef under the supervision of young John Franklin, they\r\ntrampled over some of Westall's drawings. Their hoof-marks are visible on\r\none of the originals, preserved in the Royal Colonial Institute Library,\r\nto this day.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the colony on the reef had been regularly established, a\r\ncouncil of officers considered the steps most desirable to be taken to\r\nsecure relief. It was resolved that Flinders should take the largest of\r\nthe Porpoise's two six-oar cutters, with an officer and crew, and make\r\nhis way to Port Jackson, where the aid of a ship might be obtained. The\r\nenterprise was hazardous at that season of the year. The voyage would in\r\nall probability have to be undertaken in the teeth of strong southerly\r\nwinds, and the safe arrival of the cutter, even under the direction of so\r\nskilful a seaman as Flinders, was the subject of dubious speculation. But\r\nsomething had to be done, and that promptly; and Flinders unhesitatingly\r\nundertook the attempt. He gave directions for the government of the reef\r\nduring his absence, and ordered that two decked boats should be built by\r\nthe carpenters from wreckage, so that in the event of his failure the\r\nwhole company might be conveyed to Sydney.\r\n\r\nBy the 25th August the cutter had been prepared for her long voyage, and\r\non the following day she was launched and appropriately named the Hope.\r\nIt was a Friday morning, and some of the sailors had a superstitious\r\ndread of sailing on a day supposed to be unlucky. But the weather was\r\nfine and the wind light. Flinders laughed at those who talked of luck.\r\nWith Captain Park of the Cato as his assistant officer, and a double set\r\nof rowers, fourteen persons in all, he set out at once. He carried three\r\nweeks' provisions. \"All hands gave them 3 chears, which was returned by\r\nthe boat's crew,\" says Seaman Smith. At the moment when the Hope rowed\r\naway a sailor sprang to the flagstaff whence the signal of distress had\r\nbeen flying since the morning when help from the Bridgewater had been\r\nhoped for, and hauled down the blue ensign, which was at once rehoisted\r\nwith the union in the upper canton. \"This symbolic expression of contempt\r\nfor the Bridgewater and of confidence in the success of our voyage, I did\r\nnot see without lively emotion,\" Flinders relates.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Hope to continue her brave course, we may learn from Smith\r\nhow the 80 men remaining on the reef occupied themselves:\r\n\r\n\"From this time our hands are imployd, some about our new boat, whose\r\nkeel is laid down 32 feet; others imployd in getting anything servisible\r\nfrom the wreck. Our gunns and carriadges we got from the wreck and placed\r\nthem in a half moon form, close to our flag staf, our ensign being dayly\r\nhoisted union downward. Our boats sometimes is imployd in going to an\r\nisland about ten miles distant; and sometimes caught turtle and fish.\r\nThis island was in general sand. Except on the highest parts, it produced\r\nsea spinage; very plentifully stockd with birds and egs. In this manner\r\nthe hands are imployd and the month of October is set in. Still no acct.\r\nof our Captn's success. Our boat likewise ready for launching, the\r\nrigging also fitted over her masthead, and had the appearance of a rakish\r\nschooner. On the 4th of Octr. we launchd her and gave her name of the\r\nHope.* (* Smith was in error. The boat built at the reef was named the\r\nResource. The Hope, as stated above, was the cutter in which Flinders\r\nsailed from the reef to Sydney. See A Voyage to Terra Australis 2 315 and\r\n329.) On the 7th we loaded her with wood in order to take it over to the\r\nisland before mentiond to make charcoal for our smith to make the\r\nironwork for the next boat, which we intend to build directly. She\r\naccordingly saild.\"\r\n\r\nA letter by John Franklin to his father* gives an entertaining account of\r\nthe wreck and of some other points pertaining to our subject (*\r\nManuscript, Mitchell Library.):\r\n\r\n\"Providential Bank, August 26th, 1803,\r\n\r\n\"Latitude 22 degrees 12 minutes, longitude 155 degrees 13 minutes\r\n(nearly) east.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Father,\r\n\r\n\"Great will be your surprise and sorrow to find by this that the late\r\ninvestigators are cast away in a sandy patch of about 300 yards long and\r\n200 broad, by the wreck of H.M.S. Porpoise on our homeward bound passage\r\non the reefs of New South Wales. You will then wonder how we came into\r\nher. I will explain: The Investigator on her late voyage, was found when\r\nsurveying the Gulf of Carpentaria to be rotten, which obliged us to make\r\nour best way to Port Jackson; but the bad state of health of our crew\r\ninduced Captain Flinders to touch at Timor for refreshment; which being\r\ndone he sailed, having several men died on the passage of dysentery. On\r\nour arrival she was surveyed and condemned as being unfit for service.\r\nThere being no other ship in Sydney fit to complete her intended voyage,\r\nGovernor King determined to send us home in the Porpoise. She sailed\r\nAugust 10th, 1803, in company with the Bridgewater, extra Indiaman, and\r\nCato, steering to the north-west intending to try how short a passage\r\nmight be made through Torres Straits to England. On Wednesday, 17th, we\r\nfell in with reefs,* (* Cato Islet and reefs.) surveyed them, and kept\r\nour course, until half-past nine, when I was aroused by the cry of\r\nbreakers, and before I got on deck the ship struck on the rocks.* (*\r\nWreck Reef.) Such boats as could be were got out, the masts cut away, and\r\nthen followed the horrors of ship-wreck, seas breaking over, men\r\ndowncast, expecting the ship every moment to part. A raft of spars was\r\nmade, and laid clear, sufficiently large to take the ship's company in\r\ncase the ship should part; but as Providence ordained she lasted until\r\nmorning, when happy were we to see this sandbank bearing north-west\r\nquarter of a mile. But how horrible on the other hand to see the Cato in\r\na worse condition than ourselves, the men standing forward shouting for\r\nassistance, but could get none, when their ship was parting. All except\r\nthree of them committed themselves to the waves, and swam to us, and are\r\nnow living on this bank. The Bridgewater appeared in sight, and then in a\r\nmost shameful and inhuman manner left us, supposing probably every soul\r\nhad perished. Should she make that report on her arrival consider it as\r\nfalse. We live, we have hopes of reaching Sydney. The Porpoise being a\r\ntough little ship hath, and still does in some measure, resist the power\r\nof the waves, and we have been able to get most of her provisions, water,\r\nspars, carpenter's tools, and every other necessary on the bank,\r\nfortunate spot that it is, on which 94 souls live. Captain Flinders and\r\nhis officers have determined that he and fourteen men should go to Port\r\nJackson in a cutter and fetch a vessel for the remainder; and in the\r\nmeantime to build two boats sufficiently large to contain us if the\r\nvessels should not come. Therefore we shall be from this bank in six or\r\neight weeks, and most probably in England by eight or nine. Our loss was\r\nmore felt as we anticipated the pleasure of seeing our friends and\r\nrelations after an absence of two years and a half. Let me recommend you\r\nto give yourselves no anxiety, for there is every hope of reaching\r\nEngland ere long. I received the letters by the Glatton and was sorry to\r\nfind that Captain F. had lost his father. He was a worthy man. You would\r\nnot dislike to have some account of our last voyage, I suppose. We were\r\n11 months from Sydney, and all that time without fresh meat or\r\nvegetables, excepting when we were at Timor, and now and then some fish,\r\nand mostly in the torrid zone, the sun continually over our head, and the\r\nthermometer at 85, 86, and 89. The ship's company was so weakened by the\r\nimmense heat that when we were to the southward they were continually ill\r\nof the dysentery; nay, nine of them died, besides eight we lost on our\r\nlast cruise. Thus you see the Investigator's company has been somewhat\r\nshattered since leaving England. Our discoveries have been great, but the\r\nrisks and misfortunes many.\r\n\r\n\"Have you got the prize money? I see it is due, and may be had by\r\napplying at No. 21 Milbank Street, Westminster; due July 22, 1802. If you\r\ndo not, it will go to Greenwich Hospital. I had occasion to draw for\r\nnecessaries at Sydney this last time 24 pounds from Captain F.\r\n\r\n\"JOHN FRANKLIN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 20. TO ILE-DE-FRANCE IN THE CUMBERLAND.\r\n\r\nGovernor King received the news of the wreck of the Porpoise immediately\r\nafter the arrival of the Hope in Port Jackson, on the evening of\r\nSeptember 8th. King and his family were at dinner when to his great\r\namazement Flinders was announced. \"A razor had not passed over our faces\r\nfrom the time of the shipwreck,\" he records, \"and the surprise of the\r\nGovernor was not little at seeing two persons thus appear whom he\r\nsupposed to be many hundred leagues on their way to England; but so soon\r\nas he was convinced of the truth of the vision before him, and learned\r\nthe melancholy cause, an involuntary tear started from the eye of\r\nfriendship and compassion, and we were received in the most affectionate\r\nmanner.\"\r\n\r\nKing in an official letter confessed that he could not \"sufficiently\r\ncommend your voluntary services, and those who came with you, in\r\nundertaking a voyage of 700 miles in an open boat to procure relief for\r\nour friends now on the reef.\" It was, indeed, an achievement of no small\r\nquality in itself.\r\n\r\nPlans for the relief of the wrecked people were immediately formed.\r\nCaptain Cumming of the Rolla, a 438-ton merchant ship, China-bound,\r\nagreed to call at the reef, take some of them on board, and carry them to\r\nCanton, whilst the Francis, which was to sail in company, was to bring\r\nthe remainder back to Sydney. Flinders himself was to take command of the\r\nCumberland, a 29-ton schooner, and was to sail in her to England with his\r\ncharts and papers as rapidly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Cumberland was a wretchedly small vessel in which to traverse fifteen\r\nthousand miles of ocean. She was \"something less than a Gravesend passage\r\nboat\" and hardly better suited for the effort than a canal barge. But,\r\ngiven anything made of wood that would float and steer, inconvenience and\r\ndifficulty never baffled Matthew Flinders when there was service to\r\nperform. She was the first vessel that had been built in Australia.\r\nMoore, the Government boat-builder, had put her together for colonial\r\nservice, and she was reputed to be strong, tight, and well behaved in a\r\nsea; but of course she was never designed for long ocean voyages.\r\nHowever, she was the only boat available; and though Flinders regretted\r\nthat the meagre accommodation she afforded would prevent him from working\r\nat his charts while making the passage, he was too eager to accomplish\r\nhis purpose to hesitate about accepting the means. \"Fortuna audaces\r\njuvat\" might at any time have been his motto; fortune helpeth them that\r\ndare. An unavoidable delay of thirteen days caused some anxiety. \"Every\r\nday seemed a week,\" until he could get on his way towards the reef. But,\r\nat length, on September 21st, the Cumberland in company with the Rolla\r\nand Francis sailed out of Port Jackson. The crew consisted of a boatswain\r\nand ten men.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, October 7th, exactly six weeks after the Hope had left Wreck\r\nReef, the ensign on the flagstaff was sighted from the mast-head of the\r\nRolla. At about the same time a seaman who was out with Lieutenant\r\nFowler, in a new boat that had been constructed from the wreckage, saw a\r\nwhite object in the distance against the blue of the sky. At first he\r\ntook it for a sea-bird; but, looking at it more steadfastly, he suddenly\r\njumped up, exclaiming, \"damn my blood, what's that?\" It was, in truth,\r\nthe top-gallant sail of the Rolla. Everybody looked at it; a sail indeed\r\nit was; Flinders had not failed them, and rescue was imminent. A shout of\r\ndelight went up, and the boat scurried back to the reef to announce the\r\nnews.\r\n\r\nAt about two o'clock in the afternoon, Flinders anchored under the lee of\r\nthe bank. The shell of the Porpoise still lay on her beam side high up on\r\nthe reef, but, her carronades having been landed, the happy people\r\nwelcomed their deliverers with a salute of eleven guns. \"Every heart was\r\noverjoyed at this unexpected delivery,\" as seaman Smith's narrative\r\nrecords; and when Flinders stepped ashore, he was long and loudly\r\ncheered. Men pressed around him to shake his hands and thank him, and\r\ntears of joy rolled down the hard, weather-worn faces of men not\r\nover-given to a display of feeling. For his own part \"the pleasure of\r\nrejoining my companions so amply provided with the means of relieving\r\ntheir distress made this one of the happiest moments of my life.\"\r\n\r\nIn singular contrast with the pleasure of everyone else was the cool\r\ndemeanour of Samuel Flinders. A letter previously cited contains a\r\nreference to him, which suggests that he was not always quite brotherly\r\nor generally satisfactory. On this occasion he was oddly stiff and\r\nuncordial. Flinders relates the incident: \"Lieutenant Flinders, then\r\ncommanding officer on the bank, was in his tent calculating some lunar\r\ndistances, when one of the young gentlemen ran to him calling, 'Sir, sir,\r\na ship and two schooners in sight.' After a little consideration, Mr.\r\nFlinders said he supposed it was his brother come back, and asked if the\r\nvessels were near. He was answered, not yet; upon which he desired to be\r\ninformed when they should reach the anchorage, and very calmly resumed\r\nhis calculations. Such are the varied effects produced by the same\r\ncircumstances upon different minds. When the desired report was made, he\r\nordered the salute to be fired, and took part in the general\r\nsatisfaction.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the welcoming was over, Flinders assembled all the people and\r\ninformed them what his plans were. Those who chose might go to Sydney in\r\nthe Francis; the others, with the exception of ten, would sail in the\r\nRolla to Canton and others take ship for England. To accompany him in the\r\nCumberland he chose John Aken, who had been master of the Investigator,\r\nEdward Charrington, the boatswain, his own servant, John Elder, and seven\r\nseamen. Their names are contained in the logbook which General Decaen\r\ndetained at Ile-de-France. They were George Elder, who had been carpenter\r\non the Porpoise, John Woods, Henry Lewis, Francis Smith, N. Smith, James\r\nCarter, and Jacob Tibbet, all picked men.\r\n\r\nYoung Franklin went in the Rolla. As he explained in a letter to his\r\nmother* (* Manuscripts, Mitchell Library.): \"The reason I did not\r\naccompany Captain Flinders was the smallness of the vessel and badness of\r\naccommodation, he having only taken the master with him.\" The young\r\nsailor's application had won the commendation of the commander, who was a\r\nhero to him throughout his adventurous life. We find Flinders writing to\r\nhis wife* \"John Franklin approves himself worthy of notice. He is capable\r\nof learning everything that we can show him, and but for a little\r\ncarelessness I would not wish to have a son otherwise than he is.\" (*\r\nFlinders Papers.)\r\n\r\nAt noon on October 11th, four days after the arrival of the relieving\r\nships at the reef, they parted company, with cheers and expressions of\r\ngood will. The Rolla accomplished her voyage to China safely, and in the\r\nfollowing year Lieutenant Fowler, Samuel Flinders, John Franklin, and the\r\nremainder of the old Investigator's company who sailed in her returned to\r\nEngland. On their return voyage they participated in as remarkable a\r\ncomedy as the history of naval warfare contains. Their ship was one of a\r\ncompany of thirty-one sail, all richly laden merchantmen, under the\r\ngeneral command of the audacious Commodore Nathaniel Dance; and he,\r\nencountering a French squadron under Rear-Admiral Linois, succeeded by\r\nsheer, impudent \"bluff\" in making him believe that they were convoyed by\r\nBritish frigates, and deterred him from capturing or even seriously\r\nattacking them.* (* Lieutenant Fowler was presented with a sword valued\r\nat 50 guineas for his part in this action, which took place on 14th\r\nFebruary, 1804, off Polo Aor, Malacca Strait. See the author's Terre\r\nNapoleon page 16.)\r\n\r\nFrom the very commencement of the voyage the little Cumberland caused\r\ntrouble and anxiety. She leaked to a greater extent than had been\r\nreported, and the pumps were so defective that a fourth part of every day\r\nhad to be spent at them to keep the water down. They became worse with\r\nconstant use, and by the time Timor was reached, on November 10th, one of\r\nthem was nearly useless. At Kupang no means of refitting the worn-out\r\npump or of pitching the leaky seams in the upper works of the boat were\r\nobtainable; and Flinders had to face a run across the Indian Ocean with\r\nthe prospect of having to keep down the water with an impaired equipment.\r\n\r\nWhen discussing the route with Governor King before leaving Sydney,\r\nFlinders had pointed out that the size of the Cumberland, and the small\r\nquantity of stores and water she could carry, would oblige him to call at\r\nevery convenient port; and he mentioned that the places which he\r\ncontemplated visiting were Kupang in Timor, Ile-de-France (Mauritius),\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, St. Helena, and one of the Canaries. But King took\r\nexception to a call being made at Ile-de-France, partly because he did\r\nnot wish to encourage communication between Port Jackson and the French\r\ncolony, and partly because he understood that hurricane weather prevailed\r\nin the neighbourhood at about the time of the year when the Cumberland\r\nwould be in the Indian Ocean. To respect King's wishes, Flinders on\r\nleaving Kupang set a course direct for the Cape of Good Hope. But when\r\ntwenty-three days out from Timor, on the 4th of December, a heavy\r\nsouth-west ground swell combined with a strong eastern following sea\r\ncaused the vessel to labour exceedingly, and to ship such quantities of\r\nwater that the one effective pump had to be kept working day and night\r\ncontinually. If anything went wrong with this pump, a contingency to be\r\nfeared from its incessant employment, there was a serious risk of\r\nfoundering.\r\n\r\nAfter enduring two days of severe shaking, Flinders came to the\r\ndetermination that considerations of safety compelled him to make for\r\nIle-de-France. On December 6th, therefore, he altered the Cumberland's\r\ncourse for that island.\r\n\r\nWhen he wrote his Voyage to Terra Australis, he had not his journal in\r\nhis possession, and worked from notes of his recollections. In telling\r\nthe story now, the author has before him not only what Flinders wrote in\r\nthis way, but also a copy of the French translation of the journal which\r\nDecaen had prepared for his own use, and several letters written by\r\nFlinders, wherein he related what passed in his mind when he resolved to\r\nalter his course.\r\n\r\nThe first and most imperative reason was the necessity for repairing the\r\nship and refitting the pumps. Secondly, rations had had to be shortened,\r\nand victuals and water were required. Thirdly, Flinders had come to the\r\nconclusion that the Cumberland was unfit to complete the voyage to\r\nEngland, and he hoped to be able to sell her, and procure a passage home\r\nin another ship. \"I cannot write up my journal unless the weather is\r\nextremely fine,\" he wrote. Fourthly, he desired \"to acquire a knowledge\r\nof the winds and weather at the island of the actual state of the French\r\ncolony, of what utility it and its dependencies in Madagascar, might be\r\nto Port Jackson, and whether the colony could afford me resources in my\r\nfuture voyages.\"* (* Journal.)\r\n\r\nWhen he sailed from Port Jackson there was, as far as he knew, peace\r\nbetween England and France. But there was a possibility that war had\r\nbroken out again. In that event, the thought occurred to him that it\r\nwould be safer to call at the French colony than at the Cape, since he\r\nhad a passport from the French Government, but not from the Dutch, who\r\nwould probably be involved in hostilities against England. He did not\r\nforget that the passport was made out for the Investigator, not for the\r\nCumberland. \"But I checked my suspicions by considering that the passport\r\nwas certainly intended to protect the voyage and not the Investigator\r\nonly. A description of the Investigator was indeed given in it, but the\r\nintention of it could be only to prevent imposition. The Cumberland was\r\nnow prosecuting the voyage, and I had come in her for a lawful purpose,\r\nand upon such an occasion as the passport allowed me to put into a French\r\nport. The great desire also that the French nation has long shown to\r\npromote geographical researches, and the friendly treatment that the\r\nGeographe and the Naturaliste had received at Port Jackson, rose up\r\nbefore me as guarantees that I should not be impeded, but should receive\r\nthe kindest welcome and every assistance.\"* (* Flinders to Fleurieu; copy\r\nin Record Office, London. An entry in his Journal shows that only when he\r\nwas informed that the war had been renewed did it occur to Flinders that\r\nthe French authorities would interpret literally the fact that the\r\npassport was granted to the Investigator.)\r\n\r\nHe had no chart of Ile-de-France, but a description in the third edition\r\nof the Encyclopaedia Britannica informed him that the principal harbour,\r\nPort Louis, was on the north-west side, and thither he intended to steer.\r\n\r\nOn December 15th the peaks of the island showed up against the morning\r\nsky. At noon the Cumberland was running along the shore, close enough to\r\nbe observed, and made a signal for a pilot from the fore-topmast head. A\r\nsmall French schooner came out of a cove, and Flinders, wishing to speak\r\nwith her to make enquiries, followed her. She ran on, and entered a port,\r\nwhich proved to be Baye du Cap (now Cape Bay) on the south-west coast.\r\nFlinders steered in her wake, thinking that she was piloting him to\r\nsafety. The truth was that the French on board thought they were being\r\npursued by an English fighting ship, which meant to attack them; and\r\nimmediately they came to anchor, without even waiting to furl sails, they\r\nhurried ashore in a canoe and reported accordingly. Thus from the very\r\nbeginning of his appearance at Ile-de-France, was suspicion cast on\r\nFlinders. So began his years of sore trouble.\r\n\r\nIt was evident from the commotion on shore that the arrival of the\r\nCumberland had aroused excitement. Flinders saw the people from the\r\nschooner speaking to a soldier, who, from the plumes in his hat, appeared\r\nto be an officer. Presently some troops with muskets appeared in sight.\r\nApparently orders had been given to call out the guard. Flinders\r\nconcluded that a state of war existed, and hastened to inform the\r\nauthorities by sending Aken ashore in a boat, that he had a passport, and\r\nwas free from belligerent intentions.\r\n\r\nAken returned with an officer, Major Dunienville, to whom the passport\r\nwas shown, and the necessities of the Cumberland explained. He politely\r\ninvited Flinders to go on shore and dine with him. It was pointed out\r\nthat the immediate requirements were fresh water and a pilot who would\r\ntake the ship round to Port Louis, as repairs could not be effected at\r\nBaye du Cap. The pilot was promised for the next day, and Major\r\nDunienville at once sent a boat for the Cumberland's empty casks.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he got ashore again, Dunienville wrote a report of what had\r\noccurred to the Captain-General, or Military Governor of the island,\r\nGeneral Decaen, and sent it off by a special messenger. In this document*\r\nhe related that a schooner flying the English flag had chased a coastal\r\nschooner into the bay; that the alarm had been given that she was a\r\nBritish privateer; that he had at once called out the troops; and that,\r\nexpecting an attack, he had ordered the women and children to retire to\r\nthe interior, and had given orders for cattle and sheep to be driven into\r\nthe woods! \"Happily,\" he proceeded, \"all these precautions, dictated by\r\ncircumstances, proved to be unnecessary.\" (* Decaen Papers Volume 84.)\r\nThe English captain had explained to him that he had merely followed the\r\ncoastal boat because he had no pilot, and wished to enter the bay to\r\nsolicit succour; \"adding that he did not know of the war, and\r\nconsequently had no idea that he would spread alarm by following it.\r\n\r\nLater in the afternoon Dunienville returned to the Cumberland with the\r\ndistrict commandant, Etienne Bolger, and an interpreter. The passport was\r\nagain examined, when Bolger pointed out that it was not granted to the\r\nCumberland but to the Investigator, and that the matter must be dealt\r\nwith by the Governor personally. At first he desired to send the passport\r\nto him, but Flinders objected to allowing it to leave his possession, as\r\nit constituted his only guarantee of protection from the French\r\nauthorities. Then it was arranged that he should travel overland to Port\r\nLouis, while Aken took round the ship. But finally Bolger allowed\r\nFlinders to sail round in the Cumberland, under the guidance of a pilot.\r\nHe was hospitably entertained at dinner by Major Dunienville, who invited\r\na number of ladies and gentlemen to meet him; and on the morning of\r\nDecember 16th he sailed, with the major on board, for Port Louis, where\r\nhe was to confront General Decaen.\r\n\r\nThe character and position of the Captain-General of Ile-de-France are so\r\nimportant in regard to the remainder of Flinders' life, that it will be\r\ndesirable to devote a chapter to some account of him.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 21. GENERAL DECAEN.\r\n\r\nCharles Mathieu Isidore Decaen was born at Caen, the ancient and\r\npicturesque capital of Normandy, on April 13th, 1769. Left an orphan at\r\nthe age of twelve, his education was superintended by a friend of his\r\nfather, who had been a public official. At the end of his schooldays he\r\nstudied law under an advocate of local celebrity, M. Lasseret. Though his\r\njuristic training was not prolonged, the discipline of the office gave a\r\ncertain bent to his mind, a certain lawyer-like strictness and method to\r\nhis mode of handling affairs, that remained characteristic during his\r\nmilitary career, and was exceedingly useful to him while he governed\r\nIle-de-France. Very often in perusing his Memoires* the reader perceives\r\ntraces of the lawyer in the language of the soldier. (* The Memoires et\r\nJournaux du General Decaen were prepared for publication by himself, and\r\nthe portion up to the commencement of his governorship has been printed,\r\nwith notes and maps, by Colonel Ernest Picard, Chief of the Historical\r\nSection of the Staff of the French Army (2 volumes Paris 1910). Colonel\r\nPicard informed me that he did not intend to print the remainder,\r\nthinking that the ground was sufficiently covered by Professor Henri\r\nPrentout's admirable book L'Ile de France sous Decaen. I have, therefore,\r\nhad the section relating to Flinders transcribed from the manuscript, and\r\nused it freely for this book.) Thus, when during the campaign of the\r\nRhine he found that his superior officer, General Jourdan, was taking\r\nabout with him as his aide-de-camp a lady in military attire, Decaen,\r\nwith a solemnity that seems a little un-French under the circumstances,\r\ncondemned the breach of the regulations as conduct \"which was not that of\r\na father of a family, a legislator and a general-in-chief.\" As for the\r\nlady, \"les charmes de cette maussade creature\" merely evoked his scorn.\r\nIt does not appear that Jourdan's escapade produced any ill effects in a\r\nmilitary sense, but it was against the regulations, and Decaen was as yet\r\nas much lawyer as soldier.\r\n\r\nWhen the revolutionary wars broke out, and France was ringed round by a\r\ncoalition of enemies, the voice of \"la patrie en danger\" rang in the ears\r\nof the young student like a call from the skies. He was twenty-two years\r\nof age when two deputies of the Legislative Assembly came down to Caen\r\nand made an appeal to the manhood of the country to fly to arms. Decaen,\r\nfuming with patriotic indignation, threw down his quill, pitched his\r\ncalf-bound tomes on to their shelf, and was the first to inscribe his\r\nname upon the register of the fourth battalion of the regiment of\r\nCalvados, an artillery corps. He was almost immediately despatched to\r\nMayence on the Rhine, where Kleber (who was afterwards to serve with\r\ndistinction under Bonaparte in Egypt) hard pressed by the Prussians,\r\nwithdrew the French troops into the city (March, 1793) and prepared to\r\nsustain a siege.\r\n\r\nDecaen rose rapidly, by reason not merely of his bull-dog courage and\r\nstubborn tenacity, but also of his intelligence and integrity. He\r\nreceived his \"baptism of fire\" in an engagement in April, when Kleber\r\nsent a detachment to chase a Prussian outpost from a neighbouring village\r\nand to collect whatever forage and provisions might be obtained. He was\r\nhonest enough to confess--and his own oft-proved bravery enabled him to\r\ndo so unashamed--that, when he first found the bullets falling about him,\r\nhe was for a moment afraid. \"I believe,\" he wrote, \"that there are few\r\nmen, however courageous they may be, who do not experience a chill, and\r\neven a feeling of fear, when for the first time they hear around them the\r\nwhistling of shot, and above all when they first see the field strewn\r\nwith killed and wounded comrades.\"* (* Memoires 1 13.) But he was a\r\nsergeant-major by this time, and remembered that it was his duty to set\r\nan example; so, screwing up his courage to the sticking-place by an\r\neffort of will, and saying to himself that it was not for a soldier of\r\nFrance to quail before a ball, he deliberately wheeled his horse to the\r\nfront of a position where a regiment was being shaken by the enemy's\r\nartillery fire, and by his very audacity stiffened the wavering troops\r\nand saved the situation.\r\n\r\nAfter the capitulation of Mayence in July, 1793, Decaen fought with\r\ndistinction in the war in La Vendee. In this cruel campaign he displayed\r\nunusual qualities as a soldier, and attained the rank of\r\nadjutant-general. Kleber gave him a command calling for exceptional\r\nnerve, with the comment, \"It is the most dangerous position, and I\r\nthought it worthy of your courage.\" It was Decaen, according to his own\r\naccount, who devised the plan of sending out a number of mobile columns\r\nto strike at the rebels swiftly and unexpectedly. But though he was\r\nsucceeding in a military sense, these operations against Frenchmen, while\r\nthere were foreign foes to fight beyond the frontiers, were thoroughly\r\ndistasteful to him. The more he saw of the war in La Vendee, and the more\r\nterribly the thumb of the national power pressed upon the throat of the\r\nrebellion, the more he hated the service. It was at his own solicitation,\r\ntherefore, that he was transferred to the army of the Rhine in January,\r\n1795.\r\n\r\nHere he served under the ablest general, saving only Bonaparte himself,\r\nwhom the wars of the Revolution produced to win glory for French arms,\r\nJean Victor Moreau. His bravery and capacity continued to win him\r\nadvancement. Moreau promoted him to the command of a brigade, and\r\npresented him with a sword of honour for his masterly conduct of a\r\nretreat through the Black Forest, when, in command of the rear-guard, he\r\nfought the Austrians every mile of the road to the Rhine.\r\n\r\nHe became a general of division in 1800. At the battle of Hohenlinden,\r\nwhere Moreau concentrated his troops to give battle to the Austrians\r\nunder the Archduke John, Decaen performed splendid service; indeed it was\r\nhe who chose the position, and recommended it as a favourable place for\r\ntaking a stand.* (* Memoires 2 89.) Moreau knew him well by now, and on\r\nthe eve of the fight (December 2nd) when he brought up his division to\r\nthe plateau in the forest of Ebersberg, where the village of Hohenlinden\r\nstands, and presented himself at headquarters to ask for orders, the\r\ncommander-in-chief rose to greet him with the welcome, \"Ah, there is\r\nDecaen, the battle will be ours to-morrow.\" It was intended for a\r\npersonal compliment, we cannot doubt, though Decaen in his Memoires (2\r\n136) interpreted it to mean that the general was thinking of the 10,000\r\ntroops whose arrival he had come to announce.\r\n\r\nMoreau's plan was this. He had posted his main force strongly fronting\r\nthe Austrian line of advance, on the open Hohenlinden plateau. The enemy\r\nhad to march through thickly timbered country to the attack. The French\r\ngeneral instructed Decaen and Richepance to manoeuvre their two\r\ndivisions, each consisting of 10,000 men, through the forest, round the\r\nAustrian rear, and to attack them there, as soon as they delivered their\r\nattack upon the French front. The Archduke John believed Moreau to be in\r\nfull retreat, and hurried his army forward from Haag, east of\r\nHohenlinden, amid falling snow.\r\n\r\n\"By torch and trumpet fast array'd\r\nEach horseman drew his battle-blade,\r\nAnd furious every charger neigh'd\r\n  To join the dreadful revelry.\r\nThen shook the hills with thunder riven;\r\nThen rush'd the steed, to battle driven,\r\nAnd louder than the bolts of Heaven\r\n  Far flashed the red artillery.\"\r\n\r\nDecaen's division marched at five o'clock on the morning of December 3rd,\r\nand shortly before eight the boom of the Austrian cannon was heard. His\r\ntroops pressed forward in a blinding snowstorm. An officer said that the\r\nguns seemed to show that the Austrians were turning the French position.\r\n\"Ah, well,\" said Decaen, \"if they turn ours, we will turn theirs in our\r\nturn.\" It was one of the few jokes he made in his whole life, and it\r\nexactly expressed the situation. The Austrian army was caught like a nut\r\nin a nut-cracker. Battered from front and rear, their ranks broke, and\r\nfugitives streamed away east and west, like the crumbled kernel of a\r\nfilbert. Decaen threw his battalions upon their rear with a furious\r\nvigour, and crumpled it up; and almost at the very moment of victory the\r\nsnow ceased to fall, the leaden clouds broke, and a brilliant sun shone\r\ndown upon the scene of carnage and triumph. Ten thousand Austrians were\r\nkilled, wounded, or taken prisoners, whilst 80 guns and about two hundred\r\nbaggage waggons fell as spoils to the French. In this brilliant victory\r\nDecaen's skill and valour, rapidity and verve, had been of inestimable\r\nvalue, as Moreau was prompt to acknowledge.\r\n\r\nThe quick soldier's eye of Bonaparte recognised him at once as a man of\r\noutstanding worth. The Consulate had been established in December, 1799,\r\nand the First Consul was anxious to attach to him strong, able men. In\r\n1802 Decaen ventured to use his influence with the Government regarding\r\nan appointment to the court of appeal at Caen, for which Lasseret, his\r\nold master in law, was a candidate; and we find Bonaparte writing to\r\nCambaceres, who had charge of the law department, that \"if the citizen\r\npossesses the requisite qualifications I should like to defer to the\r\nwishes of General Decaen, who is an officer of great merit.\"* (*\r\nNapoleon's Correspondance Document 5596.) He saw much of Bonaparte in\r\nParis during 1801 and 1802, when the part he had to play was an extremely\r\ndifficult one, demanding the exercise of tact and moral courage in an\r\nunusual measure. The Memoires throw a vivid light on the famous quarrel\r\nbetween Moreau and Napoleon, which in the end led to the exile of the\r\nvictor of Hohenlinden.\r\n\r\nMoreau was Decaen's particular friend, the commander who had given him\r\nopportunities for distinction, one whom he loved and honoured as a man\r\nand a patriot. But he was jealous of Napoleon's success, was disaffected\r\ntowards the consular government, and was believed to be concerned in\r\nplots for its overthrow. On the other hand, Napoleon was not only the\r\nhead of the State, but was the greatest soldier of his age. Decaen's\r\nadmiration of him was unbounded, and Napoleon's attitude towards Decaen\r\nwas cordial. He tried to reconcile these two men whom he regarded with\r\nsuch warm affection, but failed. One day, when business was being\r\ndiscussed, Napoleon said abruptly, \"Decaen, General Moreau is conducting\r\nhimself badly; I shall have to denounce him.\" Decaen was moved to tears,\r\nand insisted that Napoleon was ill informed. \"You are good yourself,\"\r\nsaid the First Consul, \"and you think everybody else is like you. Moreau\r\nis corresponding with Pichegru,\" whose conspiracy was known to the\r\nGovernment. \"It is not possible.\" \"But I have a letter which proves it.\"\r\nMoreover, Moreau was openly disrespectful to the Government. He had\r\npresented himself out of uniform on occasions when courtesy demanded that\r\nhe should wear it. If Moreau had anything to complain about, he did not\r\nmake it better by associating with malcontents. \"He has occupied a high\r\nposition, which gives him influence, and a bad influence upon public\r\nopinion hampers the work of the Government. I have not fallen here out of\r\nthe sky, you know; I follow my glory. France wants repose, not more\r\ndisturbance.\" Decaen manfully championed his friend, \"I am persuaded,\" he\r\nsaid, \"that if you made overtures to Moreau you would easily draw him\r\ntowards you.\" \"No,\" said Napoleon \"he is a shifting sand.\" Moreau said to\r\nDecaen, \"I am too old to bend my back\"; but the latter was of opinion\r\nthat the real source of the mischief was that Moreau had married a young\r\nwife, and that she and his mother-in-law considered they were entitled to\r\nas much attention as Madame Bonaparte received. Pride, jealousy and\r\nvanity, he declared, were the real source of the quarrel. Decaen, indeed,\r\nhas a story that when Madame Moreau once called upon Josephine at\r\nMalmaison, she returned in an angry state of mind because she was not at\r\nonce admitted, bidding a servant tell her mistress that the wife of\r\nGeneral Moreau was not accustomed to be kept waiting. The simple\r\nexplanation was that Josephine was in her bath!\r\n\r\nDecaen came to be appointed Governor of Ile-de-France in this way. One\r\nday, after dining with Napoleon at Malmaison, the First Consul took a\r\nstroll with him, and in the course of conversation asked him what he\r\nwanted to do. \"I have my sword for the service of my country,\" said\r\nDecaen. \"Very good,\" answered Napoleon, \"but what would you like to do\r\nnow?\" Decaen then mentioned that he had been reading the history of the\r\nexploits of La Bourdonnaye and Dupleix in India, and was much attracted\r\nby the possibilities for the expansion of French power there. \"Have you\r\never been to India?\" enquired Napoleon. \"No, but I am young, and,\r\ndesiring to do something useful, I should like to undertake a mission\r\nwhich I believe would not be likely to be coveted by many, having regard\r\nto the distance between France and that part of the world. And even if it\r\nwere necessary to spend ten years of my life awaiting a favourable\r\nopportunity of acting against the English, whom I detest because of the\r\ninjury they have done to our country, I should undertake the task with\r\nthe utmost satisfaction.\" Napoleon merely observed that what he desired\r\nmight perhaps be arranged.\r\n\r\nA few months later Decaen was invited to breakfast with Napoleon at\r\nMalmaison. He was asked whether he was still inclined to go to India, and\r\nreplied that he was. \"Very well, then, you shall go.\" \"In what capacity?\"\r\n\"As Captain-General. Go and see the Minister of Marine, and tell him to\r\nshow you all the papers relative to the expedition that is in course of\r\nbeing fitted out.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the treaty of Amiens, negotiated in 1801, Great Britain agreed to\r\nrestore to the French Republic and its allies all conquests made during\r\nthe recent wars except Trinidad and Ceylon. From the British point of\r\nview it was an inglorious peace. Possessions which had been won in fair\r\nfight, by the ceaseless activity and unparalleled efficiency of the Navy,\r\nand by the blood and valour of British manhood, were signed away with a\r\nstroke of the pen. The surrender of the Cape was especially lamentable,\r\nbecause upon security at that point depended the safety of India and\r\nAustralia. But the Addington ministry was weak and temporising, and was\r\nalarmed about the internal condition of England, where dear food,\r\nscarcity of employment and popular discontent, consequent upon prolonged\r\nwarfare, made the King's advisers nervously anxious to put an end to the\r\nstruggle. The worst feature of the situation was that everybody\r\nthoroughly well understood that it was a mere parchment peace. Cornwallis\r\ncalled it \"an experimental peace.\" It was also termed \"an armistice\" and\r\n\"a frail and deceptive truce\"; and though Addington declared it to be \"no\r\nordinary peace but a genuine reconciliation between the two first nations\r\nof the world,\" his flash of rhetoric dazzled nobody but himself. He was\r\nthe Mr. Perker of politics, an accommodating attorney rubbing his hands\r\nand exclaiming \"My dear sir!\" while he bartered the interests of his\r\nclient for the delusive terms of a brittle expediency.\r\n\r\nDecaen was to go to India to take charge of the former French possessions\r\nthere, under the terms of the treaty, and from Pondicherry was also to\r\ncontrol Ile-de-France (Mauritius) which the English had not taken during\r\nthe war. Napoleon's instructions to him clearly indicated that he did not\r\nexpect the peace to endure. Decaen was \"to dissimulate the views of the\r\nGovernment as much as possible\"; \"the English are the tyrants of India,\r\nthey are uneasy and jealous, it is necessary to behave towards them with\r\nsuavity, dissimulation and simplicity.\" He was to regard his mission\r\nprimarily as one of observation upon the policy and military dispositions\r\nof the English. But Napoleon informed him in so many words that he\r\nintended some day to strike a blow for \"that glory which perpetuates the\r\nmemory of men throughout the centuries.\" For that, however, it was first\r\nnecessary \"that we should become masters of the sea.\"* (* Memoires 2\r\n310.)\r\n\r\nDecaen sailed from Brest in February, 1803. Lord Whitworth, the British\r\nambassador to Paris, watched the proceedings with much care, and promptly\r\ndirected the attention of his Government to the disproportionate number\r\nof officers the new Captain-General was taking with him. The Government\r\npassed the information on to the Governor-General of India, Lord\r\nWellesley, who was already determined that, unless absolutely ordered so\r\nto do, he would not permit a French military force to land. Before Decaen\r\narrived at Pondicherry, indeed, in June, 1803, Wellesley had received a\r\ndespatch from Lord Hobart, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies,\r\nwarning him that, notwithstanding the treaty of Amiens, \"certain\r\ncircumstances render desirable a delay in the restitution of their\r\npossessions in India\" to the French, and directing that territory\r\noccupied by British troops was not to be evacuated by them without fresh\r\norders. Great Britain already perceived the fragility of the peace, and,\r\nin fact, was expediting preparations for a renewal of war, which was\r\ndeclared in May, 1803.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the French frigate Marengo, with Decaen on board,\r\narrived at Pondicherry, the British flag still flew over the Government\r\nbuildings, and he soon learnt that there was no disposition to lower it.\r\nMoreover, La Belle Poule, which had been sent in advance from the Cape to\r\nherald the Captain-General's coming, was anchored between two British\r\nships of war, which had carefully ranged themselves alongside her. Decaen\r\ngrasped the situation rapidly. A few hours after his arrival, the French\r\nbrig Belier appeared. She had left France on March 25th, carrying a\r\ndespatch informing the Captain-General that war was anticipated, and\r\ndirecting him to land his troops at Ile-de-France, where he was to assume\r\nthe governorship.\r\n\r\nRear-Admiral Linois, who commanded the French division, wanted to sail at\r\nonce. Decaen insisted on taking aboard some of the French who were\r\nashore, but Linois pointed to the strong British squadron in sight, and\r\nprotested that he ought not to compromise the safety of his ships by\r\ndelaying departure. Linois was always a very nervous officer. Decaen\r\nstormed, and Linois proposed to call a council of his captains. \"A\r\ncouncil!\" exclaimed Decaen, \"I am the council!\" It was worthy of what\r\nVoltaire attributed to Louis XIV: \"l'etat, c'est mois.\" After sunset\r\nDecaen visited the ships of the division in a boat, and warned their\r\ncaptains to get ready to follow the Marengo out of the roadstead of\r\nPondicherry in the darkness. He considered that it would be extremely\r\nembarrassing if the British squadron, suspecting their intentions,\r\nendeavoured to frustrate them. At an appointed hour the Marengo quietly\r\ndropped out of the harbour, cutting the cable of one of her anchors\r\nrather than permit any delay.\r\n\r\nOn August 15th Decaen landed at Port Louis, Ile-de-France, and on the\r\nfollowing day he took over the government. He had therefore been in\r\ncommand exactly four months when Matthew Flinders, in the Cumberland, put\r\ninto Baye du Cap on December 15th.\r\n\r\nFor his conduct in the Flinders affair Decaen has been plentifully\r\ndenounced. \"A brute,\" \"a malignant tyrant,\" \"vindictive, cruel and\r\nunscrupulous\"--such are a few shots from the heavy artillery of language\r\nthat have been fired at his reputation. The author knows of one admirer\r\nof Flinders who had a portrait of Decaen framed and hung with its face to\r\nthe wall of his study. It is, unfortunately, much easier to denounce than\r\nto understand; and where resonant terms have been flung in freest\r\nprofusion, it does not appear that an endeavour has been made to study\r\nwhat occurred from the several points of view, and to examine Decaen's\r\ncharacter and actions in the light of full information. A postponement of\r\nepithets until we have ascertained the facts is in this, as in so many\r\nother cases, extremely desirable.\r\n\r\nNo candid reader of Decaen's Memoires, and of Prentout's elaborate\r\ninvestigation of his administration, can fail to recognise that he was a\r\nconspicuously honest man. During his governorship he handled millions of\r\nfrancs. Privateers from Ile-de-France captured British merchant ships, to\r\na value, including their cargo, of over 3 million pounds sterling,* a\r\nshare of which it would have been easy for Decaen to secure. (*\r\n\"Prentout, page 509, estimates the value of captures at 2 million pounds,\r\nbut Mr. H. Hope informed Flinders in 1811, that insurance offices in\r\nCalcutta had actually paid 3 million pounds sterling on account of ships\r\ncaptured by the French at Mauritius. Flinders, writing with exceptional\r\nopportunities for forming an opinion, calculated that during the first\r\nsixteen months of the war the French captures of British merchant ships\r\nbrought to Ile-de-France were worth 1,948,000 pounds (Voyage 2 416).) But\r\nhis financial reputation is above suspicion. His management was\r\neconomical and efficient. He ended his days in honourable poverty.\r\n\r\nHe was blunt and plainspoken; and though he could be pleasant, was when\r\nruffled by no means what Mrs. Malaprop called \"the very pineapple of\r\npoliteness.\" His quick temper brought him into continual conflict with\r\nsuperiors and subordinates. He quarrelled repeatedly with generals and\r\nministers; with Admiral Linois, with Soult, with Decres, with Barras,\r\nwith Jourdan, and with many others. When General Lecourbe handed him a\r\nwritten command during the Rhine campaign, he says himself that, \"when I\r\nreceived the order I tightened my lips and turned my back upon him.\" He\r\nspeaks of himself in one place as being \"of a petulant character and too\r\nfree with my tongue.\" That concurs with Flinders' remark, after bitter\r\nexperience of Decaen, that he possessed \"the character of having a good\r\nheart, though too hasty and violent.\"\r\n\r\nDecaen's military capacity was much higher than his historical reputation\r\nmight lead one to suppose. During the fierce wars of the Napoleonic\r\nempire, whilst Ney, Oudinot, Murat, Junot, Augereau, Soult, St. Cyr,\r\nDavoust, Lannes, Marmont, Massena and Suchet, were rendering brilliant\r\nservice under the eye of the great captain, and were being converted into\r\ndukes and princes, Decaen was shut up in a far-off isle in the Indian\r\nOcean, where there was nothing to do but hold on under difficulties, and\r\nwait in vain for the turn of a tide that never floated a French fleet\r\ntowards the coveted India. Colonel Picard, than whom there is hardly a\r\nbetter judge, is of opinion that had Decaen fought with the Grand Army in\r\nEurope, his military talents would have designated him for the dignity of\r\na marshal of the Empire. On his return he did become a Comte, but then\r\nthe Napoleonic regime was tottering to its fall.\r\n\r\nSuch then was the man--stubborn, strong-willed, brusque, honest,\r\nirritable, ill-tempered, but by no means a bad man at heart--with whom\r\nMatthew Flinders had to do. We may now follow what occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 22. THE CAPTIVITY.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock in the afternoon of December 17th the Cumberland entered\r\nPort Louis, where Flinders learnt that Le Geographe had sailed for France\r\non the previous day. As soon as he could land he went ashore to present\r\nhimself to the Governor, whom he found to be at dinner. To occupy the\r\ntime until an interview could be arranged, he joined a party of officers\r\nwho were lounging in a shady place, and gossiped with them about his\r\nvoyage, about Baudin's visit to Port Jackson, about the English\r\nsettlement there, \"and also concerning the voyage of Monsieur Flindare,\r\nof whom, to their surprise, I knew nothing, but afterwards found it to be\r\nmy own name which they so pronounced.\"\r\n\r\nIn a couple of hours he was conducted to Government House, where, after a\r\ndelay of half an hour, he was shown into a room. At a table stood two\r\nofficers. One was a short, thick man in a gold-laced mess jacket, who\r\nfixed his eyes sternly on Flinders, and at once demanded his passport and\r\ncommission. This was General Decaen. Beside him stood his aide-de-camp,\r\nColonel Monistrol. The General glanced over the papers, and then enquired\r\n\"in an impetuous manner,\" why Flinders had come to Ile-de-France in the\r\nCumberland, when his passport was for the Investigator. The necessary\r\nexplanation being given, Decaen exclaimed impatiently, \"You are imposing\r\non me, sir! It is not probable that the Governor of New South Wales\r\nshould send away the commander of a discovery expedition in so small a\r\nvessel.\" Decaen's own manuscript Memoires show that when this story was\r\ntold to him, he thought it \"very extraordinary that he should have left\r\nPort Jackson to voyage to England in a vessel of 29 tons;\" and, in truth,\r\nto a man who knew nothing of Flinders' record of seamanship it must have\r\nseemed unlikely. He handed back the passport and commission, and gave\r\nsome orders to an officer; and as Flinders was leaving the room \"the\r\nCaptain-General said something in a softer tone about my being well\r\ntreated, which I could not comprehend.\"\r\n\r\nIt is clear that Decaen's brusque manner made Flinders very angry. He did\r\nnot know at this time that it was merely the General's way, and that he\r\nwas not at all an ill-natured man if discreetly handled. On board the\r\nCumberland, in company with the interpreter and an officer, who were very\r\npolite, he confesses having \"expressed my sentiments of General Decaen's\r\nmanner of receiving me,\" adding \"that the Captain-General's conduct must\r\nalter very much before I should pay him a second visit, or even set my\r\nfoot on shore again.\" It is very important to notice Flinders' state of\r\nmind, because it is apparent that a whole series of unfortunate events\r\nturned upon his demeanour at the next interview. His anger is perfectly\r\nintelligible. He was a British officer, proud of his service; he had for\r\nyears been accustomed to command, and to be obeyed; he knew that he was\r\nguiltless of offence; he felt that he had a right to protection and\r\nconsideration under his passport. Believing himself to have been\r\naffronted, he was not likely to be able to appreciate the case as it\r\npresented itself at the moment to this peppery general; that here was the\r\ncaptain of an English schooner who, as reported, had chased a French\r\nvessel into Baye du Cap, and who gave as an explanation that he had\r\ncalled to seek assistance while on a 16,000 mile voyage, in a 29-ton\r\nboat. Surely Flinders' story, as Decaen saw it at this time, was not a\r\nprobable one; and at all events he, as Governor of Ile-de-France, had a\r\nduty to satisfy himself of its truth. We can well understand Flinders'\r\nindignation; but can we not also appreciate Decaen's doubt?\r\n\r\nThe officers, acting under instructions, collected all the charts,\r\npapers, journals, letters, and packets, found on board, and put them in a\r\ntrunk which, says Flinders, \"was sealed by me at their desire.\" They then\r\nrequested him to go ashore with them, to a lodging at an inn, which the\r\nGeneral had ordered to be provided for him. In fact, they had orders to\r\ntake him there. \"What! I exclaimed in the first transports of surprise\r\nand indignation, I am then a prisoner!\" The officers expressed the hope\r\nthat the detention would not last more than a few days, and assured him\r\nthat in the meantime he should want for nothing. Flinders, accompanied by\r\nAken, went ashore, and the two were escorted to a large house in the\r\nmiddle of the town, the Cafe Marengo, where they were shown into a room\r\napproached by a dark entry up a dirty staircase, and left for the night\r\nwith a sentry on guard in the passage outside.\r\n\r\nThat Flinders had no doubt that he would soon be released, is shown by\r\nthe fact that he wrote from the tavern the following letter to the\r\ncaptain of the American ship Hunter, then lying in Port Louis: \"Sir,\r\nunderstanding that you are homeward bound, I have to represent to you\r\nthat I am here with an officer and nine men belonging to His Britannic\r\nMajesty's ship Investigator, lately under my command, and if I am set at\r\nliberty should be glad to get a passage on board your vessel to St.\r\nHelena, or on any other American who does not touch at the Cape of Good\r\nHope* and may be in want of men. I am, Sir, etc., etc., MATTHEW FLINDERS.\r\n\r\n\"If it is convenient for you to call upon me at the tavern where I am at\r\npresent confined, I shall be glad to see you as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\n(* He did not wish to call at the Cape, because if he got clear of the\r\nFrench frying-pan he did not want to jump into the Dutch fire.)\r\n\r\nEarly in the afternoon of the following day Colonel Monistrol came to the\r\ninn to take Flinders and Aken before the General, who desired to ask\r\ncertain questions. The interrogatories were read from a paper, as\r\ndictated by Decaen, and Flinders' answers were translated and written\r\ndown. In the document amongst Decaen's papers the French questions and\r\nanswers are written on one side of the paper, with the English version\r\nparallel; the latter being signed by Flinders. The translation is crude\r\n(the scribe was a German with some knowledge of English) but is printed\r\nbelow literally:\r\n\r\n\"Questions made to the commanding officier of an English shooner anchored\r\nin Savanna Bay, at the Isle of France, on the 24th frimaire 12th year (on\r\nthe 17th December, 1803) chasing a coaster, which in consequence of the\r\ndeclaration of war between the French Republic and Great Britain, had\r\nintention to avoid the poursuit of said shooner. Said shooner carried the\r\nnext day in the harbour of Port North-West, where she anchored under\r\ncartel colours, the commanding officer having declared to the officer of\r\nthe health boat that his name was Matthew Flinders, and his schooner the\r\nCumberland.\r\n\r\n\"Demanded: the Captain's name?\r\n\r\n\"Answered: Matthew Flinders.\r\n\r\n\"D.: From what place the Cumberland sailed?\r\n\r\n\"A.: From Port Jackson.\r\n\r\n\"D.: At what time?\r\n\r\n\"A.: The Captain does not recollect the date of his departure. He thinks\r\nit is on the 20th of September.\r\n\r\n\"D.: What is the purpose of his expedition?\r\n\r\n\"A.: His only motive was to proceed on to England as soon as possible, to\r\nmake the report of his voyages and to request a ship to continue them.\r\n\r\n\"D.: What can be the reason which has determined Captain Flinders to\r\nundertake a voyage on board of the so small a vessel?\r\n\r\n\"A.: To avoid losing two months on proceeding by China, for a ship\r\nsailing from Port Jackson was to put in China.\r\n\r\n\"D.: Does not Port Jackson offer frequent opportunities for Europe?\r\n\r\n\"A.: There are some, as he has observed it above, but that ship putting\r\nin China is the reason which determined him not to proceed that way.\r\n\r\n\"D.: At what place had the Cumberland put in?\r\n\r\n\"A.: At Timor.\r\n\r\n\"D.: What could be the reason of her putting in at Timor?\r\n\r\n\"A.: To take fresh provision and water. He has left Timor 34 days ago.\r\n\r\nD.: What passports or certificates has he taken in that place?\r\n\r\n\"A.: None.\r\n\r\n\"D.: What has been his motive for his coming at the Isle of France?\r\n\r\n\"A.: The want of water. His pumpers (sic) are bad, and his vessel is very\r\nleaky.\r\n\r\n\"D.: To what place does Captain Flinders intend to go to from this\r\nisland?\r\n\r\n\"A.: Having no passport for the Dutch Government, he cannot put in the\r\nCape, according to his wishes, and will be obliged to stop at St. Helena.\r\n\r\n\"D.: What can be the reason of his having none of his officiers,\r\nnaturalis, or any of the other persons employed in said expedition?\r\n\r\n\"A.: Two of these gentlemen have remained in Port Jackson to repair on\r\nboard of the ship Captain Flinders expected to obtain in England,* and\r\nthe rest have proceeded on to China. (* \"Pour s'embarquer sur le vaisseau\r\nque le Cap. Flinders a espoir d'obtenir en Angleterre,\" in the French.\r\nThat is to say, Brown and Bauer remained behind till Flinders came out\r\nagain with another ship.)\r\n\r\n\"D.: What reason induced Captain Flinders to chase a boat in sight of the\r\nisland?\r\n\r\n\"A.: Being never to this island, he was not acquainted with the harbour.\r\nSeeing a French vessel he chased her* for the only purpose of obtaining a\r\npilot, and seeing her entering a bay he followed her. (* It is singular\r\nthat Flinders did not take exception to this word \"chased\" in the\r\ntranslation when he signed it. The French version of his statement is\r\ncorrect: \"il forca de voile, NON POUR LUY APPUYER CHASSE mais pour luy\r\ndemander un pilote.\" The German translator boggled between the French and\r\nthe English.)\r\n\r\n\"D.: What reason had he to make the land to leewards, the different\r\ndirectories pointing out the contrary route to anchor in the harbour.\r\n\r\n\"A.: He came to windwards, but the wind shifting contrary he took to\r\nleewards and perceiving said vessel he followed her and anchored in the\r\nsame bay. He has no chart of the island.\r\n\r\n\"D.: Why has he hoisted cartel colours?\r\n\r\n\"A.: He answers that it is the custom, since Captain Baudin coming to\r\nPort Jackson hoisted the colours of both nations.\r\n\r\n\"D.: Was he informed of the war?\r\n\r\n\"A.: No.\r\n\r\n\"D.: Has he met with any ship either at sea or in the different ports\r\nwhere he put in?\r\n\r\n\"A.: He met one ship only, by the 6 or 7 degrees to the east of the Isle\r\nof France. He did not speak her, though desirous of so doing, being\r\nprevented by the night. He met with no ship at Timor.\r\n\r\n\"In consequence of the questions made to Captain Flinders respecting to\r\nhis wreck, he declares that after putting in at Port Jackson with the\r\nship under his command, he was through her bad condition obliged to leave\r\nher, being entirely decayed. The Governor at that time furnished him with\r\na ship thought capable of transporting him to Europe. He had the\r\nmisfortune to wreck on the east coast of New Holland by the 22 degrees 11\r\nminutes of latitude south on some rock distant 700 miles from Port\r\nJackson, and 200 miles from the coast. He embarked in the said ship's\r\nboat, taking with him 14 men, and left the remainder of his crew on a\r\nsand bank. He lost on this occasion three charts respecting his voyages\r\nand particularly Golph Carpentary. After 14 days' passage he arrived at\r\nPort Jackson. After tarrying in said place 8 or 9 days, the Governor\r\nfurnished him with the small vessel he is now in, and a ship to take the\r\nremainder of the crew left on the bank. This vessel not being a\r\ngovernment ship and bound to China, proceeded on her intended voyage with\r\nthe officers and the crew which had been left on the bank.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Flinders declares that of the two boxes remitted by him one\r\ncontains despatches directed to the Secretary of State and the other was\r\nentrusted to him by the commanding officer of the troops in Port Jackson,\r\nand that he is ignorant what they contain.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Mw. Flinders to ascertain the legality of this expedition and\r\nthe veracity of what he expose,* (* \"La verite de son expose,\" i.e., the\r\ntruth of his statement.) has opened in our presence a trunk sealed by him\r\ncontaining the papers having a reference to his expedition, and to give\r\nus a copy by him certified of the passport delivered to him by the First\r\nConsul and His Majesty King of Great Britain; equally the communication\r\nof his journal since the condemnation of his ship Investigator.\r\n\r\n\"Port North-West, Ile of France, the 26th frimaire 12th year of the\r\nFrench Republic (answering to the 19th December, 1803).\r\n\r\n\"(Signed) MATTW. FLINDERS.\"\r\n\r\nFlinders corroborates the statement regarding the taking of papers from\r\nthe trunk, stating that they consisted of the third volume of his rough\r\nlog-book, which contained \"the whole of what they desired to know,\"\r\nrespecting his voyage to Ile-de-France. He told Decaen's Secretary to\r\nmake such extracts as were considered requisite, \"pointing out the\r\nmaterial passages.\" \"All the books and papers, the third volume of my\r\nrough log-book excepted, were then returned into the trunk, and sealed as\r\nbefore.\" It is important to notice that at no time were papers taken from\r\nthe trunk without Flinders' knowledge and concurrence, because the charge\r\nhas frequently been made, even by historical writers of authority,* that\r\nhis charts were plagiarised by the cartographers of Baudin's expedition.\r\n(* In the Cambridge Modern History, for instance (9 739): \"The French\r\nauthorities at Mauritius having captured and imprisoned the explorer\r\nFlinders on his passage to England, attempted by the use of his papers to\r\nappropriate for their ships the credit of his discoveries along the south\r\ncoast of Australia.\") Flinders himself never made any such allegation,\r\nnor is there any foundation for it. On the contrary, as will be made\r\nclear hereafter, neither Decaen and his officers, nor any of the French,\r\never saw any of Flinders' charts at any time.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the examination the General, on behalf of Madame\r\nDecaen, sent Flinders an invitation to dine, dinner being then served. At\r\nthis point, one cannot help feeling, he made a tactical mistake. It is\r\neasily understood, and allowance can be made for it, but the consequences\r\nof it were serious. He was angry on account of his detention, irritated\r\nby the treatment to which he had been subjected, and unable in his\r\npresent frame of mind to appreciate the Governor's point of view. He\r\nrefused to go, and said he had already dined. The officer who bore the\r\ninvitation pressed him in a kindly manner, saying that at all events he\r\nhad better go to the table. Flinders replied that he would not; if the\r\nGeneral would first set him at liberty he would accept the invitation\r\nwith pleasure, and be flattered by it. Otherwise he would not sit at\r\ntable with Decaen. \"Having been grossly insulted both in my public and\r\nprivate character, I could not debase the situation I had the honour to\r\nhold.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of so haughty a refusal upon an inflammatory temper like that\r\nof Decaen may be readily pictured. Presently an aide-de-camp returned\r\nwith the message that the General would renew the invitation when Captain\r\nFlinders was set at liberty. There was a menace in the cold phrase.\r\n\r\nNow, had Flinders bottled up his indignation and swallowed his pride--had\r\nhe frankly recognised that he was in Decaen's power--had he acknowledged\r\nthat some deference was due to the official head of the colony of a\r\nforeign nation with whom his country was at war--his later troubles might\r\nhave been averted. An opportunity was furnished of discussing the matter\r\ngenially over the wine and dessert. He would have found himself in the\r\npresence of a man who could be kind-hearted and entertaining when not\r\nprovoked, and of a charming French lady in Madame Decaen. He would have\r\nbeen assisted by the secretary, Colonel Monistrol, who was always as\r\nfriendly to him as his duty would permit. He would have been able to hold\r\nthe company spell-bound with the story of the many adventures of his\r\nactive, useful life. He would have been able to demonstrate his bona\r\nfides completely. It is a common experience that the humane feelings of\r\nmen of Decaen's type are easily touched; and his conduct regarding the\r\nNapoleon-Moreau quarrel has been related above with some fulness for the\r\npurpose of showing that there was milk as well as gunpowder in his\r\ncomposition. But Flinders was angry; justifiably angry no doubt, but\r\nunfortunately angry nevertheless, since thereby he lost his chance.\r\n\r\nHe learnt afterwards that \"some who pretended to have information from\r\nnear the fountain-head hinted that, if his invitation to dinner had been\r\naccepted, a few days would have been the whole\" of his detention.* (*\r\nFlinders Voyage 2 398.) That seems probable. He had no better friend than\r\nSir Joseph Banks; and he learnt to his regret that Banks \"was not quite\r\nsatisfied with his conduct to the Government of Mauritius, thinking he\r\nhad treated them perhaps with too much haughtiness.\" His comment upon\r\nthis was, \"should the same circumstances happen to me again I fear I\r\nshould follow nearly the same steps.\"* (* Flinders' Papers.) That is the\r\nsort of thing that strong-willed men say; but a knowledge of the good\r\nsense and good feeling that were native to the character of Matthew\r\nFlinders enables one to assert with some confidence that if, after this\r\nexperience, the choice had been presented to him, on the one hand of\r\nconquering his irritation and going to enjoy a pleasant dinner in\r\ninteresting company with the prospect of speedy liberation; on the other\r\nof scornfully disdaining the olive branch, with the consequence of\r\nsix-and-a-half years of heart-breaking captivity; he would have chosen\r\nthe former alternative without much reluctance. There is a sentence in\r\none of his own letters which indicates that wisdom counted for more than\r\nobstinacy in his temperament: \"After a misfortune has happened, we all\r\nsee very well the proper steps that ought to have been taken to avoid it;\r\nto be endowed with a never-failing foresight is not within the power of\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\nThat the view presented above is not too strong is clear from a passage\r\nin an unpublished portion of Decaen's Memoires. He stated that after the\r\nexamination of Flinders, \"I sent him an invitation from my wife* to come\r\nto dine with us, (* Flinders does not state that the invitation came from\r\nMadame Decaen. He may not have understood. But the refusal of it would on\r\nthat account have been likely to make the General all the more angry.)\r\nalthough he had given me cause to withhold the invitation on account of\r\nhis impertinence; but from boorishness, or rather from arrogance, he\r\nrefused that courteous invitation, which, if accepted, would indubitably\r\nhave brought about a change favourable to his position, through the\r\nconversation which would have taken place.\"* (* Decaen Papers Volume 10.\r\nDecaen said in his despatch to the Minister: \"Captain Flinders imagined\r\nthat he would obtain his release by arguing, by arrogance, and especially\r\nby impertinence; my silence with regard to his first letter led him to\r\nrepeat the offence.\") Here it is distinctly suggested that if the\r\ninvitation had been accepted, and a pleasant discussion of the case had\r\nensued, the detention of the Cumberland and her commander would probably\r\nnot have been prolonged.\r\n\r\nFurther light is thrown on these regrettable occurrences by a manuscript\r\nhistory of Ile-de-France, written by St. Elme le Duc,* (* Bibliotheque\r\nNationale, nouveaux acquisitions, France Number 1 775.) a friend of\r\nDecaen, who possessed intimate knowledge of the General's feelings. It is\r\ntherein stated that Decaen received Flinders \"in uniform, the head\r\nuncovered,\" but that \"Captain Flinders presented himself with arrogance,\r\nhis hat upon his head; they had to ask him to remove it.\" The same writer\r\nalleges that Flinders disregarded all the rules of politeness. It is fair\r\nto state these matters, since the candid student must always wish to see\r\na case presented from several points of view. But it must be said that\r\nonly an intense feeling of resentment could have unhinged the courteous\r\ndisposition which was habitual with Flinders. A gentler man in his\r\nrelations with all could hardly have been found. He was not more\r\nrespectful to authority than he was considerate to subordinates; and\r\nthroughout his career a close reading of his letters and journals, and of\r\ndocuments relating to him, can discover no other instance of even\r\ntemporary deviation from perfect courtesy. Even in this case one can\r\nhardly say that he was to blame. There was sufficient in what occurred to\r\nmake an honest man angry. But we wish to understand what occurred and why\r\nit occurred, and for that reason we cannot ignore or minimise the\r\nsolitary instance wherein a natural flame of anger fired a long train of\r\nmiserable consequences.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, did Decaen intend to do with Flinders, at the beginning? He\r\nnever intended to keep him six-and-a-half years. He simply meant to\r\npunish him for what he deemed to be rudeness; and his method of\r\naccomplishing that object was to report to Paris, and allow the case to\r\nbe determined by the Government, instead of settling it himself\r\nforthwith. Here again Flinders was well informed. His journal for May\r\n24th, 1806, contains the following entry:* (* Flinders' Papers.) \"It has\r\nbeen said that I am detained a prisoner here solely because I refused the\r\ninvitation of General Decaen to dine; that to punish me he referred the\r\njudgment of my case to the French Government, knowing that I should\r\nnecessarily be detained twelve months before an answer arrived.\" Or, as\r\nhe stated the matter in his published book (2 489): \"My refusal of the\r\nintended honour until set at liberty so much exasperated the\r\nCaptain-General that he determined to make me repent it.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen presently that the term of detention, originally intended\r\nto endure for about a year, was lengthened by circumstances that were\r\nbeyond Decaen's control; that the punishment which sprang from the hasty\r\nire of a peppery soldier increased, against his own will, into what\r\nappeared to all the world, and most of all to the victim, to be a piece\r\nof malevolent persecution. The ball kicked off in a fit of spleen rolled\r\non and on beyond recovery.\r\n\r\nThere was, it must be admitted, quite enough in the facts brought under\r\nDecaen's notice to warrant a reference to Paris, if he chose to be\r\nawkward. In the first place, Flinders was carrying on board the\r\nCumberland a box of despatches from Governor King for the Secretary of\r\nState. As pointed out in Chapter 12, the Admiralty instructions for the\r\nInvestigator voyage cautioned him \"not to take letters or packets other\r\nthan those such as you may receive from this office or the office of His\r\nMajesty's Secretary of State.\" Governor King was well aware of this\r\ninjunction. Yet he entrusted to Flinders this box of despatches,\r\ncontaining material relative to military affairs. It is true that a state\r\nof war was not known to exist at the time when the Cumberland sailed from\r\nPort Jackson in September, 1803, although as a matter of fact it had\r\nbroken out in the previous May. But it was well known that war was\r\nanticipated. It is also true that Flinders knew nothing of the contents\r\nof the despatches. But neither, as a rule, does any other despatch\r\ncarrier in war time. When the Cumberland's papers were examined by\r\nDecaen's officers, and these despatches were read and translated, there\r\nwas at once a prima facie ground for saying, \"this officer is not engaged\r\non purely scientific work; he is the bearer of despatches which might if\r\ndelivered have an influence upon the present war.\" Flinders himself,\r\nwriting to Banks,* (* Historical Records 6 49.) said: \"I have learnt\r\nprivately that in the despatches with which I was charged by Governor\r\nKing, and which were taken from me by the French General, a demand was\r\nmade for troops to be sent out to Port Jackson for the purpose of\r\nannoying Spanish America in the event of another war, and that this is\r\nconsidered to be a breach of my passport. 'Tis pity that Governor King\r\nshould have mentioned anything that could involve me in the event of a\r\nwar, either with the French at Mauritius, or the Dutch at Timor or the\r\nCape; or that, having mentioned anything that related to war, he did not\r\nmake me acquainted in a general way with the circumstances, in which case\r\nI should have thrown them overboard on learning that war was declared;\r\nbut as I was situated, having little apprehension of being made a\r\nprisoner, and no idea that the despatches had any reference to war, since\r\nit was a time of peace when I left Port Jackson, I did not see the\r\nnecessity of throwing them overboard at a hazard. To be the bearer of any\r\ndespatches in time of peace cannot be incorrect for a ship on discovery\r\nmore than for any other; BUT WITH A PASSPORT, AND IN TIME OF WAR, IT\r\nCERTAINLY IS IMPROPER.\" With characteristic straightforwardness, Flinders\r\ndid not hesitate to tell King himself that the despatches had cast\r\nsuspicion on him:* (* Historical Records 6 105.) \"I have learned\r\nprivately that in your despatches to the Secretary of State there is\r\nmention of Spanish America, which rendered me being the bearer, criminal\r\nwith respect to my passport. 'Tis pity I had not known anything of this,\r\nfor on finding myself under the necessity of stopping at the Isle of\r\nFrance, and learning the declaration of war, I should have destroyed the\r\ndespatches; but leaving Port Jackson in time of peace, and confiding in\r\nmy passport, I did not think myself authorised to take such a step, even\r\nafter I knew of the war, having no idea there was anything in the\r\ndespatches that could invalidate my passport; neither, indeed, is it\r\ninvalidated in justice, but it is said to be the under-plea against me.\"\r\n\r\nThese despatches of King are preserved among Decaen's papers,* (* Decaen\r\nPapers Volumes 84 and 105.) and an examination of them reveals that they\r\ndid contain material of a military character. In one of them, dated\r\nAugust 7th, 1803, King referred to the possibility in any future war \"of\r\nthe Government of the Isle of France annoying this colony, as the voyage\r\nfrom hence may be done in less than seven weeks; and on the same idea\r\nthis colony may hereafter annoy the trade of the Spanish settlements on\r\nthe opposite coast. But to defend this colony against the one, and to\r\nannoy the other, it would be necessary that some regard should be had to\r\nthe military and naval defences. The defences of the port may be made as\r\nstrong as in any port I know of. By the return of cannon and batteries\r\nyour Lordship will observe that those we have are placed in the best\r\nsituation for annoying an enemy. Still, a small establishment of\r\nartillery officers and men are wanted to work those guns effectually in\r\ncase of necessity.\" King went on to make recommendations for the increase\r\nof the military strength in men, officers, and guns. The originals of\r\nthose despatches, which could furnish the French Government with valuable\r\ninformation concerning Port Jackson and the Flinders affair, are\r\nendorsed, \"letters translated and sent to France;\" and Decaen commented\r\nupon them that in his opinion the despatches alone afforded a sufficient\r\npretext for detaining Flinders. \"Ought a navigator engaged in discovery,\r\nand no longer possessing a passport for his ship, to be in time of war in\r\ncommand of a despatch-boat,* especially when, having regard to the\r\ndistance between the period of the declaration of war and his departure\r\nfrom Port Jackson he could have obtained there the news that war had\r\nbroken out?\" (* \"Devait-il en temps de guerre conduire un paquebot?\")\r\n\r\nIn reporting to his Government Decaen related the story of the\r\nCumberland's arrival from his point of view at considerable length. He\r\nexpressed himself as satisfied that her commander really was Captain\r\nFlinders of the Investigator, to whom the French Government had issued a\r\npassport; detailed the circumstances of the examination; and complained\r\nof Flinders' \"impertinence\" and \"arrogance.\" Then he proceeded to\r\ndescribe \"several motives which have caused me to judge it to be\r\nindispensable to detain Captain Flinders.\"\r\n\r\nThe first motive alleged was \"the conduct of the English Government in\r\nEurope, where she has violated all treaties, her behaviour before\r\nsurrendering the Cape of Good Hope, and her treatment of our ships at\r\nPondicherry.\" In no way could it be pretended that Flinders was connected\r\nwith these events.\r\n\r\nThe second motive was \"the seizing of Le Naturaliste, as announced by the\r\nnewspapers.\" Decaen was here referring to the fact that, when Le\r\nNaturaliste was on her homeward voyage from Port Jackson, conveying the\r\nnatural history collections, she was stopped by the British frigate\r\nMinerva and taken into Portsmouth. But no harm was done to her. She was\r\nmerely detained from May 27th, 1803, till June 6th, when she was released\r\nby order of the Admiralty. In any case Flinders had nothing to do with\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nThe third motive was that Captain Flinders' logbook showed an intention\r\nto make an examination of Ile-de-France and Madagascar, from which Decaen\r\ndrew the inference that, if the English Government received no check,\r\nthey would extend their power, and would seize the French colony. Herein\r\nthe General did a serious injustice to Flinders. His log-book did indeed\r\nindicate that he desired \"to acquire a knowledge of the winds and weather\r\nperiodically encountered at Ile-de-France, of the actual state of the\r\nFrench colony, and of what utility it and its dependencies in Madagascar\r\nmight be to Port Jackson, and whether that island could afford resources\r\nto myself in my future voyages.\" But information of this description was\r\nsuch as lay within the proper province of an explorer; and the log-book\r\ncontained no hint, nor was there a remote intention, of acquiring\r\ninformation which, however used, could be inimical to the security of the\r\nFrench colony.\r\n\r\nDecaen's mind had been influenced by reading Francois Peron's report to\r\nhim concerning the expansive designs of the British in the Pacific and\r\nIndian Oceans. \"There is no doubt,\" he informed his Government, \"that the\r\nEnglish Government have the intention to seize the whole trade of the\r\nIndian Ocean, the China Seas and the Pacific, and that they especially\r\ncovet what remains of the Dutch possessions in these waters.\" He derived\r\nthat extravagant idea from Peron's inflammatory communication, as will be\r\nseen from a perusal of that interesting document.\r\n\r\nBy these strained means, then, did Decaen give a semblance of public\r\npolicy to his decision to detain Flinders. It would have been puerile to\r\nattempt to justify his action to his superiors on the personal ground\r\nthat the English captain had vexed him; so he hooked in these various\r\npretexts, though ingenuously acknowledging that they would have counted\r\nfor nothing if Flinders had dined with him and talked the matter over\r\nconversationally!\r\n\r\nOn the day following the examination and the refusal of the invitation,\r\nFlinders was again conducted on board the Cumberland by Colonel Monistrol\r\nand the official interpreter, who \"acted throughout with much politeness,\r\napologising for what they were obliged by their orders to execute.\" On\r\nthis occasion all remaining books and papers, including personal letters,\r\nwere collected, locked up in a second trunk, and sealed. The document\r\nnoting their deposition and sealing was signed by Flinders,* who was\r\nordered to be detained in the inn under guard. (* Decaen Papers.) It was,\r\nDecaen reported, the best inn in the island, and orders were given to\r\nfurnish the prisoner with all that he could want; but Flinders described\r\nit as an exceedingly dirty place.\r\n\r\nOn his return to the inn from the ship Flinders wrote a letter to the\r\nGovernor, recounting the history of his explorations, and making two\r\nrequests: that he might have his printed books ashore, and that his\r\nservant, John Elder, might be permitted to attend him. On the following\r\nday Elder was sent to him. On the 22nd he wrote again, soliciting \"that I\r\nmay be able to sail as soon as possible after you shall be pleased to\r\nliberate me from my present state of purgatory.\"* (* Decaen Papers.) On\r\nChristmas Day he sent a letter suffused with indignant remonstrance,\r\nwherein he alleged that \"it appears that your Excellency had formed a\r\ndetermination to stop the Cumberland previously even to seeing me, if a\r\nspecious pretext were wanting for it,\" and reminded Decaen that \"on the\r\nfirst evening of my arrival...you told me impetuously that I was imposing\r\non you.\" He continued, in a strain that was bold and not conciliatory: \"I\r\ncannot think that an officer of your rank and judgment to act either so\r\nungentlemanlike or so unguardedly as to make such a declaration without\r\nproof; unless his reason had been blinded by passion, or a previous\r\ndetermination that it should be so, nolens volens. In your orders of the\r\n21st last it is indeed said that the Captain-General has acquired the\r\nconviction that I am the person I pretend to be, and the same for whom a\r\npassport was obtained by the English Government from the First Consul. It\r\nfollows then, as I am willing to explain it, that I AM NOT and WAS NOT an\r\nimposter. This plea was given up when a more plausible one was thought to\r\nbe found; but I cannot compliment your Excellency upon this alteration in\r\nyour position, for the first, although false, is the more tenable post of\r\nthe two.\"\r\n\r\nDecaen's reply was stiff and stern. He attributed \"the unreserved tone\"\r\nof Flinders to \"the ill humour produced by your present situation,\" and\r\nconcluded: \"This letter, overstepping all the bounds of civility, obliges\r\nme to tell you, until the general opinion judges of your faults or of\r\nmine, to cease all correspondence tending to demonstrate the justice of\r\nyour cause, since you know so little how to preserve the rules of\r\ndecorum.\"\r\n\r\nFlinders in consequence of this snub forebore to make further appeals for\r\nconsideration; but three days later he preferred a series of requests,\r\none of which related to the treatment of his crew:\r\n\r\n\"To his Excellency Captain-General Decaen,\r\n\"Governor in Chief, etc., etc., etc., Isle of France.\r\n\r\n\"From my confinement, December 28th, 1803.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Since you forbid me to write to you upon the subject of my detainer I\r\nshall not rouse the anger or contempt with which you have been pleased to\r\ntreat me by disobeying your order. The purpose for which I now write is\r\nto express a few humble requests, and most sincerely do I wish that they\r\nmay be the last I shall have occasion to trouble your Excellency with.\r\n\r\n\"First. I repeat my request of the 23rd to have my printed books on shore\r\nfrom the schooner.\r\n\r\n\"Second. I request to have my private letters and papers out of the two\r\ntrunks lodged in your secretariat, they having no connection with my\r\nGovernment or the voyage of discovery.\r\n\r\n\"Third. I beg to have two or three charts and three or four manuscript\r\nbooks out of the said trunks, which are necessary to finishing the chart\r\nof the Gulf of Carpentaria and some parts adjacent. It may be proper to\r\nobserve as an explanation of this last request that the parts wanting\r\nwere mostly lost in the shipwreck, and I wish to replace them from my\r\nmemory and remaining materials before it is too late. Of these a\r\nmemorandum can be taken, or I will give a receipt for them, and if it is\r\njudged necessary to exact it I will give my word that nothing in the\r\nbooks shall be erased or destroyed, but I could wish to make additions to\r\none or two of the books as well as to the charts, after which I shall be\r\nready to give up the whole.\r\n\r\n\"Fourth. My seamen complain of being shut up at night in a place where\r\nnot a breath of air can come to them, which in a climate like this must\r\nbe not only uncomfortable in the last degree, but also very destructive\r\nto European constitutions; they say, further, that the people with whom\r\nthey are placed are much affected with that disagreeable and contagious\r\ndisorder the itch; and that the provisions with which they are fed are\r\ntoo scanty, except in the article of meat, the proportion of which is\r\nlarge but of bad quality. Your Excellency will no doubt make such an\r\namendment in their condition as circumstances will permit.\r\n\r\n\"A compliance with the above requests will not only furnish me with a\r\nbetter amusement in this solitude than writing letters to your\r\nExcellency, but will be attended with advantages in which the French\r\nnation may some time share. This application respecting the charts is not\r\naltogether made upon a firm persuasion that you will return everything to\r\nme, for if I could believe that they were never to be given to me or my\r\nGovernment I should make the same request.\r\n\r\n\"Your prisoner,\r\n\r\n\"MATTHEW FLINDERS.\"\r\n\r\nOn the day when the letter was despatched, Colonel Monistrol called, and\r\npromised that the books and papers requested should be supplied; and, in\r\nfact, the trunk containing them was without delay brought to the inn. The\r\nColonel courteously expressed his regret that Flinders had adopted such a\r\ntone in his letters to the General, thinking \"that they might tend to\r\nprotract rather than terminate\" his confinement. The complaint respecting\r\nthe seamen was attended to forthwith, and they were treated exactly on\r\nthe same footing as were French sailors on service.* (* St. Eleme le\r\nDuc's manuscript History.)\r\n\r\nThe first thing Flinders did, when he received the trunk, was to take out\r\nhis naval signal-book and tear it to pieces. Next day he was conducted to\r\nGovernment House, and was allowed to take from the second trunk all his\r\nprivate letters and papers, his journals of bearings and observations,\r\ntwo log-books, and such charts as were necessary to complete his drawings\r\nof the Gulf of Carpentaria. All the other books and papers \"were locked\r\nup in the trunk and sealed as before.\"\r\n\r\nUntil the end of March, 1804, Flinders was kept at the inn, with a sentry\r\nconstantly on guard over the rooms. St. Elme le Duc, in the manuscript\r\nhistory already cited, declares that \"Captain Flinders was never put in\r\nprison,\" and that his custom of addressing letters \"from my prison\" was\r\nan \"affectation.\" But a couple of inn rooms wherein a person is kept\r\nagainst his will, under the strict surveillance of a military custodian,\r\ncertainly constitute a prison. It is true that the Governor allotted 450\r\nfrancs per month for his maintenance, sent a surgeon to attend to him\r\nwhen scorbutic sores broke out upon his body, and gave him access to the\r\npapers and books he required in order that he might occupy his time and\r\ndivert his mind with the work he loved. But it is surely quibbling to\r\npretend that even under these conditions he was not a prisoner. Even the\r\nsurgeon and the interpreter were not admitted without a written order;\r\nand when the interpreter, Bonnefoy, took from Flinders a bill, which he\r\nundertook to negotiate, the sentry reported that a paper had passed\r\nbetween the two, and Bonnefoy was arrested, nor was he liberated until it\r\nwas ascertained that the bill was the only paper he had received. The\r\nbill was the subject of an act of kindness from the Danish consul, who\r\nnegotiated it at face value at a time when bills upon England could only\r\nbe cashed in Port Louis at a discount of 30 per cent. This liberal\r\ngentleman sent the message that he would have proffered his assistance\r\nearlier but for the fear of incurring the Governor's displeasure.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made in February to induce Decaen to send his prisoner to\r\nFrance for trial. It was submitted in the following terms:* (* Decaen\r\nPapers.)\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Having waited six weeks with much anxiety for your Excellency's decision\r\nconcerning me, I made application for the honour of an audience, but\r\nreceived no answer; a second application obtained a refusal. It was not\r\nmy intention to trouble the Captain-General by recounting my grievances,\r\nbut to offer certain proposals to his consideration; and in now doing\r\nthis by letter it is my earnest wish to avoid everything that can in the\r\nmost distant manner give offence; should I fail, my ignorance and not\r\nintention must be blamed.\r\n\r\n\"First. If your Excellency will permit me to depart with my vessel,\r\npapers, etc., I will pledge my honour not to give any information\r\nconcerning the Isle of France, or anything belonging to it, for a limited\r\ntime, if it is thought that I can have gained any information; or if it\r\nis judged necessary, any other restrictions can be laid upon me. If this\r\nwill not be complied with I request:\r\n\r\n\"Second, to be sent to France.\r\n\r\n\"Third. But if it is necessary to detain me here, I request that my\r\nofficer and my people may be permitted to depart in the schooner. I am\r\ndesirous of this as well for the purpose of informing the British\r\nAdmiralty where I am, as to relieve our families and friends from the\r\nreport that will be spread of the total loss of the two ships with all on\r\nboard. My officer can be laid under what restrictions may be thought\r\nnecessary, and my honour shall be a security that nothing shall be\r\ntransmitted by me but what passes under the inspection of the officer who\r\nmight be appointed for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\"If your Excellency does not think proper to adopt any of these modes, by\r\nwhich, with submission, I conceive my voyage of discovery might be\r\npermitted to proceed without any possible injury to the Isle of France or\r\nits dependencies, I then think it necessary to remind the Captain-General\r\nthat since the shipwreck of the Porpoise, which happened now six months\r\nback, my officers and people as well as myself have been mostly confined\r\neither on a very small sandbank in the open sea, or in a boat, or\r\notherwise on board the small schooner Cumberland, where there is no room\r\nto walk, or been kept prisoners as at present; and also, that previous to\r\nthis time I had not recovered from a scorbutic and very debilitated state\r\narising from having been eleven months exposed to great fatigue, bad\r\nclimates and salt provisions. From the scorbutic sores which have again\r\ntroubled me since my arrival in this port the surgeon who dressed them\r\nsaw that a vegetable diet and exercise were necessary to correct the\r\ndiseased state of the blood and to restore my health; but his application\r\nthrough your Excellency's aide-de-camp for me to walk out, unfortunately\r\nfor my health and peace of mind, received a negative. The Captain-General\r\nbest knows whether my conduct has deserved, or the exigencies of his\r\nGovernment require, that I should continue to remain closely confined in\r\nthis sickly town and cut off from all society.\r\n\r\n\"With all due consideration, I am,\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency's prisoner,\r\n\r\n\"MATTHEW FLINDERS.\"\r\n\r\nTo this petition Decaen returned no reply. Feeling therefore that his\r\ndetention was likely to be prolonged, Flinders, weary of confinement, and\r\nlonging for human fellowship, applied to be removed to the place where\r\nBritish officers, prisoners of war, were kept. It was a large house with\r\nspacious rooms standing in a couple of acres of ground, about a mile from\r\nthe tavern, and was variously called the Maison Despeaux, or the Garden\r\nPrison. Here at all events fresh air could be enjoyed. The application\r\nwas acceded to immediately, and Colonel Monistrol himself came, with the\r\ncourtesy that he never lost an opportunity of manifesting, to conduct\r\nFlinders and Aken and to assist them to choose rooms. \"This little walk\r\nof a mile,\" Flinders recorded, \"showed how debilitating is the want of\r\nexercise and fresh air, for it was not without the assistance of Colonel\r\nMonistrol's arm that I was able to get through it. Conveyances were sent\r\nin the evening for our trunks, and we took possession of our new prison\r\nwith a considerable degree of pleasure, this change of situation and\r\nsurrounding objects producing an exhilaration of spirits to which we had\r\nlong been strangers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 23. THE CAPTIVITY PROLONGED.\r\n\r\nWe shall now see how a detention which had been designed as a sharp\r\npunishment of an officer who had not comported himself with perfect\r\nrespect, and which Decaen never intended to be prolonged beyond about\r\ntwelve months, dragged itself into years, and came to bear an aspect of\r\nobstinate malignity.\r\n\r\nDecaen's despatch arrived in France during the first half of the year\r\n1804. Its terms were not calculated to induce the French Government to\r\nregard Flinders as a man entitled to their consideration, even if events\r\nhad been conducive to a speedy determination. But the Departments,\r\nespecially those of Marine and War, were being worked to their full\r\ncapacity upon affairs of the most pressing moment. Napoleon became\r\nEmperor of the French in that year (May), and his immense energy was\r\nflogging official activities incessantly. War with England mainly\r\nabsorbed attention. At Boulogne a great flotilla had been organized for\r\nthe invasion of the obdurate country across the Channel. A large fleet\r\nwas being fitted out at Brest and at Toulon, the fleet which Nelson was\r\nto smash at Trafalgar in the following year. Matters relating to the\r\nisolated colony in the Indian Ocean did not at the moment command much\r\ninterest in France.\r\n\r\nThere were several other pieces of business, apart from the Flinders\r\naffair, to which Decaen wished to direct attention. He sent one of his\r\naides-de-camp, Colonel Barois, to Paris to see Napoleon in person, if\r\npossible, and in any case to interview the Minister of Marine and the\r\nColonies, Decres. Decaen especially directed Barois to see that the\r\nFlinders case was brought under Napoleon's notice, and he did his best.*\r\n(* Prentout page 392.) He saw Decres and asked him whether Decaen's\r\ndespatches had been well received. \"Ah,\" said the Minister pleasantly, in\r\na voice loud enough to be heard by the circle of courtiers, \"everything\r\nthat comes from General Decaen is well received.\" But there was no spirit\r\nof despatch. Finally Barois did obtain an interview with Napoleon,\r\nthrough the aid of the Empress Josephine. He referred to \"l'affaire\r\nFlinders,\" of which Napoleon knew little; but \"he appeared to approve the\r\nreasons invoked to justify the conduct of Decaen.\" The Emperor had no\r\ntime just then for examining the facts, and his approval simply reflected\r\nhis trust in Decaen. As he said to the General's brother Rene, at a later\r\ninterview, \"I have the utmost confidence in Decaen.\" But meanwhile no\r\ndirection was given as to what was to be done. It will be seen later how\r\nit was that pressure of business delayed the despatch of an intimation to\r\nIle-de-France of a step that was actually taken.\r\n\r\nThat at this time Decaen was simply waiting for an order from Paris to\r\nrelease Flinders is clear from observations which he made, and from news\r\nwhich came to the ears of the occupant of the Garden Prison. In March,\r\n1804, he told Captain Bergeret of the French navy, who showed Flinders\r\nfriendly attentions, to tell him to \"have a little patience, as he should\r\nsoon come to some determination on the affair.\" In August of the same\r\nyear Flinders wrote to King that Decaen had stated that \"I must wait\r\nuntil orders were received concerning me from the French Government.\"* (*\r\nHistorical Records 6 411.) A year later (November, 1805) he wrote: \"I\r\nfirmly believe that, if he had not said to the French Government, during\r\nthe time of his unjust suspicion of me, that he should detain me here\r\nuntil he received their orders, he would have gladly suffered me to\r\ndepart long since.\"* (* Historical Records 6 737.) Again, in July, 1806,*\r\n(* Ibid 6 106.) he wrote: \"General Decaen, if I am rightly informed, is\r\nhimself heartily sorry for having made me a prisoner,\" but \"he remitted\r\nthe judgment of my case to the French Government, and cannot permit me to\r\ndepart or even send me to France, until he shall receive orders.\"\r\n\r\nThe situation was, then, that Decaen, having referred the case to Paris\r\nin order that the Government might deal with it, could not now,\r\nconsistently with his duty, send Flinders away from the island until\r\ninstructions were received; and the Department concerned had too much\r\npressing business on hand at the moment to give attention to it. Flinders\r\nhad to wait.\r\n\r\nHis health improved amidst the healthier surroundings of his new abode,\r\nand he made good progress with his work. His way of life is described in\r\na letter of May 18th, 1804:* (* Flinders' Papers.) \"My time is now\r\nemployed as follows: Before breakfast my time is devoted to the Latin\r\nlanguage, to bring up what I formerly learnt. After breakfast I am\r\nemployed in making out a fair copy of the Investigator's log in lieu of\r\nmy own, which was spoiled at the shipwreck. When tired of writing I apply\r\nto music, and when my fingers are tired with the flute, I write again\r\ntill dinner. After dinner we amuse ourselves with billiards until tea,\r\nand afterwards walk in the garden till dusk. From thence till supper I\r\nmake one at Pleyel's quartettes; afterwards walking half an hour, and\r\nthen sleep soundly till daylight, when I get up and bathe.\"\r\n\r\nA letter to his stepmother, dated August 25th, of the same year, comments\r\non his situation in a mood of courageous resignation:* (* Flinders'\r\nPapers.) \"I have gone through some hardships and misfortunes within the\r\nlast year, but the greatest is that of having been kept here eight months\r\nfrom returning to my dear friends and family. My health is, however, good\r\nat this time, nor are my spirits cast down, although the tyranny of the\r\nGovernor of this island in treating me as a spy has been grievous. I\r\nbelieve my situation is known by this time in England, and will probably\r\nmake some noise, for indeed it is almost without example. The French\r\ninhabitants even of this island begin to make complaints of the injustice\r\nof their Governor, and they are disposed to be very kind to me. Four or\r\nfive different people have offered me any money I may want, or any\r\nservice that they can do for me, but as they cannot get me my liberty\r\ntheir services are of little avail. I have a companion here in one of my\r\nofficers, and a good and faithful servant in my steward, and for these\r\nlast four months have been allowed to walk in a garden. The Governor\r\npretends to say that he cannot let me go until he receives orders from\r\nFrance, and it is likely that these will not arrive these four months. I\r\nam obliged to call up all the patience that I can to bear this injustice;\r\nmy great consolation is that I have done nothing to forfeit my passport,\r\nor that can justify them for keeping me a prisoner, so I must be set at\r\nliberty with honour when the time comes, and my country will, I trust,\r\nreward me for my sufferings in having supported her cause with the spirit\r\nbecoming an Englishman.\"\r\n\r\nA letter to Mrs. Flinders (August 24th, 1804) voices the yearning of the\r\ncaptive for the solace of home:* (* Flinders' Papers.) \"I yesterday\r\nenjoyed a delicious piece of misery in reading over thy dear letters, my\r\nbeloved Ann. Shall I tell thee that I have never before done it since I\r\nhave been shut up in this prison? I have many friends, who are kind and\r\nmuch interested for me, and I certainly love them. But yet before thee\r\nthey disappear as stars before the rays of the morning sun. I cannot\r\nconnect the idea of happiness with anything without thee. Without thee,\r\nthe world would be a blank. I might indeed receive some gratification\r\nfrom distinction and the applause of society; but where could be the\r\nfaithful friend who would enjoy and share this with me, into whose bosom\r\nmy full heart could unburthen itself of excess of joy? Where would be\r\nthat sweet intercourse of soul, the fine seasoning of happiness, without\r\nwhich a degree of insipidity attends all our enjoyments?...I am not\r\nwithout friends even among the French. On the contrary. I have several,\r\nand but one enemy, who unfortunately, alas, is all-powerful here; nor\r\nwill he on any persuasion permit me to pass the walls of the prison,\r\nalthough some others who are thought less dangerous have had that\r\nindulgence occasionally.\"\r\n\r\n\"When my family are the subject of my meditation,\" he said in a letter to\r\nhis step-mother, \"my bonds enter deep into my soul.\"\r\n\r\nHis private opinion of Decaen is expressed in a letter written at this\r\nperiod:* (* Flinders' Papers.) \"The truth I believe is that the violence\r\nof his passion outstrips his judgment and reason, and does not allow them\r\nto operate; for he is instantaneous in his directions, and should he do\r\nan injustice he must persist in it because it would lower his dignity to\r\nretract. His antipathy, moreover, is so great to Englishmen, who are the\r\nonly nation that could prevent the ambitious designs of France from being\r\nput into execution, that immediately the name of one is mentioned he is\r\ndirectly in a rage, and his pretence and wish to be polite scarcely\r\nprevent him from breaking out in the presence even of strangers. With all\r\nthis he has the credit of having a good heart at the bottom.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain of a French ship, M. Coutance, whom Flinders had known at\r\nPort Jackson, saw Decaen on his behalf, and reported the result of the\r\ninterview. \"The General accused me of nothing more than of being trop\r\nvive; I had shown too much independence in refusing to dine with a man\r\nwho had accused me of being an impostor, and who had unjustly made me a\r\nprisoner.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile two playful sallies penned at this time show that his health\r\nand appetite had mended during his residence at the Maison Despeaux:* (*\r\nFlinders' Papers.) \"My appetite is so good that I believe it has the\r\nintention of revenging me on the Governor by occasioning a famine in the\r\nland. Falstaff says, 'Confound this grief, it makes a man go thirsty;\r\ngive me a cup of sack.' Instead of thirsty read hungry, and for a cup of\r\nsack read mutton chop, and the words would fit me very well.\" The second\r\npassage is from his private journal, and may have been the consequence of\r\ntoo much mutton chop: \"Dreamt that General Decaen was sitting and lying\r\nupon me, to devour me; was surprised to find devouring so easy to be\r\nborne, and that after death I had the consciousness of existence. Got up\r\nsoon after six much agitated, with a more violent headache than usual.\"\r\n\r\nFlinders lost no opportunity of appealing to influential Frenchmen,\r\nrelating the circumstances of his detention. He offered to submit himself\r\nto an examination by the officers of Admiral Linois' squadron, and that\r\ncommander promised to speak to Decaen on the subject, adding that he\r\nshould be \"flattered in contributing to your being set at liberty.\"\r\nCaptain Halgan, of Le Berceau, who had been in England during the short\r\npeace, and had heard much of Flinders' discoveries, visited him several\r\ntimes and offered pecuniary assistance if it were required. Flinders\r\nwrote to the French Minister of the Treasury, Barbe-Marbois, urging him\r\nto intercede, and to the Comte de Fleurieu, one of the most influential\r\nmen in French scientific circles, who was particularly well informed\r\nconcerning Australian exploration.\r\n\r\nThe flat roof of the Maison Despeaux commanded a view of Port Louis\r\nharbour; and, as Flinders was in the habit of sitting upon the roof in\r\nthe cool evenings, enjoying the sight of the blue waters, and meditating\r\nupon his work and upon what he hoped still to do, Decaen thought he was\r\ngetting to know too much. In June, 1804, therefore, the door to the roof\r\nwas ordered to be nailed up, and telescopes were taken away from the\r\nimprisoned officers. At this time also occurred an incident which shows\r\nthat Flinders' proud spirit was by no means broken by captivity. The\r\nsergeant of the guard demanded the swords of all the prisoners, that of\r\nFlinders among the rest. It was an affront to him as an officer that his\r\nsword should be demanded by a sergeant, and he promptly refused. He\r\ndespatched the following letter to the Governor:* (* Decaen Papers Volume\r\n84.)\r\n\r\n\"To His Excellency Captain-General Decaen,\r\n\"Governor-in-Chief, etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\nThe sergeant of the guard over the prisoners in this house has demanded\r\nof me, by the order of Captain Neuville, my sword, and all other arms in\r\nmy possession.\r\n\r\n\"Upon this subject I beg leave to represent to Your Excellency that it is\r\nhighly inconsistent with my situation in His Britannic Majesty's service\r\nto deliver up my arms in this manner. I am ready to deliver up to an\r\nofficer bearing your Excellency's order, but I request that that officer\r\nwill be of equal rank to myself.\r\n\r\n\"I have the honour to be,\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency's most obedient servant and prisoner,\r\n\r\n\"MATTW. FLINDERS.\r\n\r\n\"Maison Despeaux, June 2, 1804.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few days Captain Neuville called to apologise. It was, he said, a\r\nmistake on the part of the sergeant to ask for the sword. Had the\r\nGovernor required it, an officer of equal rank would have been sent, \"but\r\nhe had no intention to make me a prisoner until he should receive orders\r\nto that effect.\" Not a prisoner! What was he, then? Certainly not, said\r\nCaptain Neuville; he was merely \"put under surveillance for a short\r\nperiod.\" Inasmuch as Flinders was being treated with rather more\r\nstrictness than those who were confessedly prisoners of war, the benefit\r\nof the distinction was hard to appreciate.\r\n\r\nFlinders considered that he had been treated rather handsomely in the\r\nmatter of the sword. But about three months later a junior officer, who\r\nbehaved with much politeness, came under the orders of Colonel\r\nD'Arsonville, the town major, to demand it. D'Arsonville had been\r\ninstructed by Decaen to take possession of it, but had been unable to\r\ncome himself. Flinders considered that under the circumstances he had\r\nbetter give up the sword to save further trouble, and did so. The\r\nsignificance of the incident is that, having received no orders from\r\nFrance, Decaen from this time regarded Flinders as a prisoner of war in\r\nthe technical sense. He felt bound to hold him until instructions\r\narrived, and could only justifiably hold him as a prisoner.\r\n\r\nDecember, 1804, arrived, and still no order of release came. On the\r\nanniversary of his arrest, Flinders wrote the following letter to\r\nDecaen:* (* Decaen Papers.)\r\n\r\n\"Maison Despeaux, December 16, 1804.\r\n\r\n\"General,\r\n\r\n\"Permit me to remind you that I am yet a prisoner in this place, and that\r\nit is now one year since my arrestation. This is the anniversary of that\r\nday on which you transferred me from liberty and my peaceful occupations\r\nto the misery of a close confinement.\r\n\r\n\"Be pleased, sir, to consider that the great occupations of the French\r\nGovernment may leave neither time nor inclination to attend to the\r\nsituation of an Englishman in a distant colony, and that the chance of\r\nwar may render abortive for a considerable time at least any attempts to\r\nsend out despatches to this island. The lapse of one year shows that one\r\nor other of these circumstances has already taken place, and the\r\nconsequence of my detainer until orders are received from France will\r\nmost probably be, that a second year will be cut out of my life and\r\ndevoted to the same listless inaction as the last, to the destruction of\r\nmy health and happiness, and the probable ruin of all my further\r\nprospects. I cannot expect, however, that my private misfortunes should\r\nhave any influence upon Your Excellency's public conduct. It is from\r\nbeing engaged in a service calculated for the benefit of all maritime\r\nnations; from my passport; the inoffensiveness of my conduct; and the\r\nprobable delay of orders from France. Upon these considerations it is\r\nthat my present hope of receiving liberty must be founded.\r\n\r\n\"But should a complete liberation be so far incompatible with Your\r\nExcellency's plan of conduct concerning me as that no arguments will\r\ninduce you to grant it; I beg of you, General, to reflect whether every\r\npurpose of the most severe justice will not be answered by sending me to\r\nFrance; since it is to that Government, as I am informed, that my case is\r\nreferred for decision.\r\n\r\n\"If neither of these requests be complied with, I must prepare to endure\r\nstill longer this anxious tormenting state of suspense, this exclusion\r\nfrom my favourite and, I will add, useful employment, and from all that I\r\nhave looked forward to attain by it. Perhaps also I ought to prepare my\r\nmind for a continuance of close imprisonment. If so, I will endeavour to\r\nbear it and its consequences with firmness, and may God support my heart\r\nthrough the trial. My hopes, however, tell me more agreeable things, that\r\neither this petition to be fully released with my people, books and\r\npapers will be accorded, or that we shall be sent to France, where, if\r\nthe decision of the Government should be favourable, we can immediately\r\nreturn to our country, our families and friends, and my report of our\r\ninvestigations be made public if it shall be deemed worthy of that\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\n\"My former application for one of these alternatives was unsuccessful,\r\nbut after a year's imprisonment and a considerable alteration in the\r\ncircumstances, I hope this will be more fortunate.\r\n\r\n\"With all due consideration I have the honour to be, Your Excellency's\r\nmost obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\"MATTW. FLINDERS.\"\r\n\r\nTo this appeal the General vouchsafed no response.\r\n\r\nThe return of the hot weather aggravated a constitutional internal\r\ncomplaint from which Flinders suffered severely. The principal physician\r\nof the medical staff visited him and recommended a removal to the high\r\nlands in the interior of the island. John Aken, the companion of his\r\ncaptivity, also became very ill, and his life was despaired of. In May,\r\n1805, having somewhat recovered, he applied to be allowed to depart with\r\nseveral other prisoners of war who were being liberated on parole. Very\r\nmuch to his surprise the permission was accorded. Aken left on May 20th\r\nin an American ship bound for New York, the captain of which gave him a\r\nfree passage; taking with him all the charts which Flinders had finished\r\nup to date, as well as the large general chart of Australia, showing the\r\nextent of the new discoveries, and all papers relating to the\r\nInvestigator voyage. There was at this time a general exchange of\r\nprisoners of war, and by the middle of August the only English prisoners\r\nremaining in Ile-de-France were Flinders, his servant, who steadfastly\r\nrefused to avail himself of the opportunity to leave, and a lame seaman.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 24. THE CAPTIVITY MODIFIED.\r\n\r\nFlinders continued to reside at the Garden prison till August, 1805. In\r\nthat month he was informed that the Governor was disposed to permit him\r\nto live in the interior of the island, if he so desired. This change\r\nwould give him a large measure of personal freedom, he would no longer be\r\nunder close surveillance, and he would be able to enjoy social life. He\r\nhad formed a friendship with an urbane and cultivated French gentleman,\r\nThomas Pitot, whom he consulted, and who found for him a residence in the\r\nhouse of Madame D'Arifat at Wilhelm's Plains.\r\n\r\nHere commenced a period of five years and six months, of detention\r\ncertainly, but no longer of imprisonment. In truth, it was the most\r\nrestful period of Flinders' whole life; and, if he could have banished\r\nthe longing for home and family, and the bitter feeling of wrong that\r\ngnawed at his heart, and could have quietened the desire that was ever\r\nuppermost in his mind to continue the exploratory work still remaining to\r\nbe done, his term under Madame D'Arifat's roof would have been\r\ndelightfully happy.\r\n\r\nThose twenty months in Port Louis had made him a greatly changed man.\r\nFriends who had known him in the days of eager activity, when fatigues\r\nwere lightly sustained, would scarcely have recognised the brisk explorer\r\nin the pale, emaciated, weak, limping semi-invalid who took his leave of\r\nthe kind-hearted sergeant of the guard on August 19th, and stepped feebly\r\noutside the iron gate in company with his friend Pitot. A portrait of\r\nhim, painted by an amateur some time later, crude in execution though it\r\nis, shows the hollow cheeks of a man who had suffered, and conveys an\r\nidea of the dimmed eyes whose brightness and commanding expression had\r\nonce been remarked by many who came in contact with him.\r\n\r\nBut at all events over five years of fairly pleasant existence were now\r\nbefore him. The reason why the period was so protracted will be explained\r\nin the next chapter. This one can be devoted to the life at Wilhelm's\r\nPlains.\r\n\r\nA parole was given, by which Flinders bound himself not to go more than\r\ntwo leagues from his habitation, and to conduct himself with that degree\r\nof reserve which was becoming in an officer residing in a colony with\r\nwhose parent state his nation was at war.\r\n\r\nThe interior of Mauritius is perhaps as beautiful a piece of country as\r\nthere is in the world. The vegetation is rich and varied, gemmed with\r\nflowers and plentifully watered by cool, pure, never-failing streams. To\r\none who had been long in prison pent, the journey inland was a procession\r\nof delights. Monsieur Pitot, who was intimate with the country gentlemen,\r\nmade the stages easy, and several visits were paid by the way. The\r\ncultivated French people of the island were all very glad to entertain\r\nFlinders, of whom they had heard much, and who won their sympathy by\r\nreason of his wrongs, and their affection by his own personality.\r\nCharming gardens shaded by mango and other fruit trees, cool fish-ponds,\r\nsplashing cascades and tumbling waterfalls, coffee and clove plantations,\r\nbreathing out a spicy fragrance, stretches of natural forest--a perpetual\r\nvariety in beauty--gratified the traveller, as he ascended the thousand\r\nfeet above which stretched the plateau whereon the home of Madame\r\nD'Arifat stood.\r\n\r\nIn the garden of the house were two comfortable pavilions. One of these\r\nwas to be occupied by Flinders, the other by his servant, Elder, and the\r\nlame seaman who accompanied him. Madame D'Arifat hospitably proposed that\r\nhe should take his meals with her family in the house, and his glad\r\nacceptance of the invitation commenced a pleasant and profitable\r\nfriendship with people to whom he ever after referred with deep respect.\r\n\r\nA note about the kindness of these gentle friends is contained in a\r\nletter to his wife:* (* Flinders' Papers.) \"Madame and her amiable\r\ndaughters said much to console me, and seemed to take it upon themselves\r\nto dissipate my chagrin by engaging me in innocent amusement and\r\nagreeable conversation. I cannot enough be grateful to them for such\r\nkindness to a stranger, to a foreigner, to an enemy of their country, for\r\nsuch they have a right to consider me if they will, though I am an enemy\r\nto no country in fact, but as it opposes the honour, interest, and\r\nhappiness of my own. My employment and inclinations lead to the extension\r\nof happiness and of science, and not to the destruction of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nThe kindly consideration of the inhabitants was unfailing. Their houses\r\nwere ever open to the English captain, and they were always glad to have\r\nhim with them, and hear him talk about the wonders of his adventurous\r\nlife. He enjoyed his walks, and restored health soon stimulated him to\r\nrenewed mental activity.\r\n\r\nHe studied the French language, and learnt to speak and write it clearly.\r\nHe continued to read Latin, and also studied Malay, thinking that a\r\nknowledge of this tongue would be useful to him in case of future work\r\nupon the northern coasts of Australia and the neighbouring archipelagoes.\r\nHe never lost hope of pursuing his investigations in the field where he\r\nhad already won so much distinction. To his brother Samuel, in a letter\r\nof October, 1807, he wrote:* (* Flinders' Papers.) \"You know my intention\r\nof completing the examination of Australia as soon as the Admiralty will\r\ngive me a ship. My intentions are still the same, and the great object of\r\nmy present studies is to render myself more capable of performing the\r\ntask with reputation.\" He cogitated a scheme for exploring the interior\r\nof Australia \"from the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria to the head of the\r\ngreat gulf on the south coast,\" i.e., Spencer's Gulf. \"In case of being\r\nagain sent to Australia I should much wish that this was part of my\r\ninstructions.\" Much as he longed to see his friends in England, work,\r\nalways work, scope for more and more work, was his dominating passion.\r\n\"Should a peace speedily arrive,\" he told Banks (March, 1806), \"and their\r\nLordships of the Admiralty wish to have the north-west coast of Australia\r\nexamined immediately, I will be ready to embark in any ship provided for\r\nthe service that they may choose to send out. My misfortunes have not\r\nabated my ardour in the service of science.\" If there was work to do, he\r\nwould even give up the chance of going home before commencing it. \"In the\r\nevent of sending out another Investigator immediately after the peace,\r\nprobably Lieutenant Fowler or my brother might be chosen as first\r\nlieutenant to bring her out to me.\" He spoke of directing researches to\r\nthe Fiji Islands and the South Pacific. Rarely has there been a man so\r\nkeen for the most strenuous service, so unsparing of himself, so eager to\r\nexcel.\r\n\r\nOccasionally in the letters and journals appear lively descriptions of\r\nlife at Wilhelm's Plains. The following is a tinted vignette of this\r\nkind: \"In the evening I walked out to visit my neighbour, whom I had not\r\nseen for near a week. I met the whole family going out in the following\r\norder: First, Madame, with her youngest daughter, about six years old, in\r\na palankin with M. Boistel walking by the side of it. Next, Mademoiselle\r\nAimee, about 16, mounted astride upon an ass, with her younger sister,\r\nabout 7, behind her, also astride. Third, Mademoiselle her sister, about\r\n15, mounted upon M. Boistel's horse, also astride; and two or three black\r\nservants carrying an umbrella, lanthorn, etc., bringing up the rear. The\r\ntwo young ladies had stockings on to-day,* (* On a previous day,\r\nmentioned in the journal, they had worn none.) and for what I know\r\ndrawers also; they seemed to have occasion for them. Madame stopped on\r\nseeing me, and I paid my compliments and made the usual enquiries. She\r\nsaid they were taking a promenade, going to visit a neighbour, and on\r\nthey set. I could perceive that the two young ladies were a little\r\nashamed of meeting me, and were cautious to keep their coats well down to\r\ntheir ankles, which was no easy thing. I stood looking after and admiring\r\nthe procession some time; considering it a fair specimen of the manner in\r\nwhich the gentry of the island, who are not very well provided with\r\nconveyances, make visits in the country. I wished much to be able to make\r\na sketch of the procession. It would have been as good, with the title of\r\n'Going to See our Neighbour' under it, as the Vicar of Wakefield's family\r\n'Going to Church.'\"\r\n\r\nHe was much interested in an inspection of the Mesnil estate, where\r\nLaperouse had resided when as an officer of the French navy he had\r\nvisited Ile-de-France, and which in conjunction with another French\r\nofficer he purchased. It was here, though Flinders does not seem to have\r\nbeen aware of the romantic fact, that the illustrious navigator fell in\r\nlove with Eleanore Broudou, whom, despite family opposition, he\r\nafterwards married.* (* The charming love-story of Laperouse has been\r\nrelated in the author's Laperouse, Sydney 1912.) \"I surveyed the scene,\"\r\nwrote Flinders, \"with mingled sensations of pleasure and melancholy: the\r\nruins of his house, the garden he had laid out, the still blooming\r\nhedgerows of China roses, emblems of his reputation, everything was an\r\nobject of interest and curiosity. This spot is nearly in the centre of\r\nthe island, and upon the road from Port Louis to Port Bourbon. It was\r\nhere that the man lamented by the good and well-informed of all nations,\r\nwhom science illumined, and humanity, joined to an honest ambition,\r\nconducted to the haunts of remote savages, in this spot he once dwelt,\r\nperhaps little known to the world, but happy; when he became celebrated\r\nhe had ceased to exist. Monsieur Airolles promised me to place three\r\nsquare blocks of stone, one upon the other, in the spot where the house\r\nof this lamented navigator had stood; and upon the uppermost stone facing\r\nthe road to engrave 'Laperouse.'\"\r\n\r\nInvestigations made in later years by the Comite des Souvenirs\r\nHistoriques of Mauritius, show that Airolles carried out his promise to\r\nFlinders, and erected a cairn in the midst of what had been the garden of\r\nLaperouse. But the stones were afterwards removed by persons who had\r\nlittle sentiment for the associations of the place. In the year 1897, the\r\nComite des Souvenirs Historiques obtained from M. Dauban, then the\r\nproprietor of the estate, permission to erect a suitable memorial, such\r\nas Flinders had suggested. This was done. The inscription upon the face\r\nof the huge conical rock chosen for the purpose copies the words used by\r\nFlinders. It reads:\r\n\r\nLAPEROUSE\r\n\r\nILLUSTRE NAVIGATEUR\r\n\r\nA achete ce terrain en Avril 1775 et l'a habite.\r\n\r\nLe CAPITAINE FLINDERS dit:\r\n\r\n\"In this spot he once dwelt, perhaps little known to the world, but\r\nhappy.\"\r\n\r\n(Comite des Souvenirs Historiques. 1897.)\r\n\r\nFlinders' pen was very busy during these years. Access to his charts and\r\npapers, printed volumes and log-books (except the third log-book,\r\ncontaining details of the Cumberland's voyage), having been given to him,\r\nhe wrote up the history of his voyages and adventures. By July, 1806, he\r\nhad completed the manuscript as far as the point when he left the Garden\r\nprison. An opportunity of despatching it to the Admiralty occurred when\r\nthe French privateer La Piemontaise captured the richly laden China\r\nmerchantman Warren Hastings and brought her into Port Louis as a prize.\r\nCaptain Larkins was released after a short detention, and offered to take\r\na packet to the Admiralty. Finished charts were also sent; and Sir John\r\nBarrow, who wrote the powerful Quarterly Review article of 1810, wherein\r\nFlinders' cause was valiantly championed, had resort to this material. A\r\nvaluable paper by Flinders, upon the use of the marine barometer for\r\npredicting changes of wind at sea, was also the fruit of his enforced\r\nleisure. It was conveyed to England, read before the Royal Society by Sir\r\nJoseph Banks, and published in the Transactions of that learned body in\r\n1806.\r\n\r\nThe friendship of able and keen-minded men was not lacking during these\r\nyears. There existed in Ile-de-France a Societe d'Emulation, formed to\r\npromote the study of literary and philosophical subjects, whose members,\r\nlearning what manner of man Flinders was, addressed a memorial to the\r\nInstitute of France relating what had happened to him, and eulogising his\r\ncourage, his high character, his innocence, and the worth of his\r\nservices. They protested that he was a man into whose heart there had\r\nnever entered a single desire, a single thought, the execution of which\r\ncould be harmful to any individual, of whatever class or to whatever\r\nnation he might belong. \"Use then, we beg of you,\" they urged, \"in favour\r\nof Captain Flinders the influence of the first scientific body in Europe,\r\nthe National Institute, in order that the error which has led to the\r\ncaptivity of this learned navigator may become known; you will acquire,\r\nin rendering this noble service, a new title to the esteem and the honour\r\nof all nations, and of all friends of humanity.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General of India, Lord Wellesley, took a keen interest in\r\nFlinders' situation, and in 1805 requested Decaen's \"particular\r\nattention\" to it, earnestly soliciting him to \"release Captain Flinders\r\nimmediately, and to allow him either to take his passage to India in the\r\nThetis or to return to England in the first neutral ship.\" Rear-Admiral\r\nSir Edward Pellew, commander-in-chief of the British naval forces in the\r\nEast Indies, tried to effect an exchange by the liberation of a French\r\nofficer of equal rank. But in this direction nothing was concluded.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, with agreeable society, amidst sympathetic\r\nfriends, in a charming situation, well and profitably employed upon his\r\nown work, Flinders spent over five years of his captivity. He never\r\nceased to chafe under the restraint, and to move every available\r\ninfluence to secure his liberty, but it cannot be said that the chains\r\nwere oppressively heavy. Decaen troubled him very little. Once (in May,\r\n1806) the General's anger flamed up, in consequence of a strong letter of\r\nprotest received from Governor King of New South Wales. King's affection\r\nfor Flinders was like that of a father for a son, and on receipt of the\r\nnews about the Cumberland his indignation poured itself out in this\r\nletter to Decaen, with which he enclosed a copy of Flinders' letter to\r\nhim. It happened that, at the time of the arrival of the letter in\r\nIle-de-France, Flinders was on a visit to Port Louis, where he had been\r\npermitted to come for a few days. The result of King's intervention was\r\nthat Decaen ordered him to return to Wilhelm's Plains, and refused the\r\napplication he had made to be allowed to visit two friends who were\r\nliving on the north-east side of the island.\r\n\r\nJohn Elder, Flinders' servant, remained with him until June, 1806. He\r\nmight have left when there was a general exchange of prisoners in August,\r\n1805, and another opportunity of quitting the island was presented in\r\nApril, 1806, when the lame seaman departed on an American ship bound for\r\nBoston. But Elder was deeply attached to his master, and would have\r\nremained till the end had not his mind become somewhat unhinged by\r\nfrequent disappointments and by his despair of ever securing liberation.\r\nWhen his companion, the lame seaman, went away, Elder developed a form of\r\nmelancholy, with hallucinations, and appeared to be wasting away from\r\nloss of sleep and appetite. Permission for him to depart was therefore\r\nobtained, and from July, 1806, Flinders was the only remaining member of\r\nthe Cumberland's company.\r\n\r\nThroughout the period of detention Flinders was placed on half-pay by the\r\nAdmiralty. It cannot be said that he was treated with generosity by the\r\nGovernment of his own country at any time. He was not a prisoner of war\r\nin the strict sense, and the rigid application of the ordinary\r\nregulations of service in his peculiar case seems to have been a rather\r\nstiff measure. Besides, the Admiralty had evidence from time to time, in\r\nthe receipt of new charts and manuscripts, that Flinders was\r\nindustriously applying himself to the duties of the service on which he\r\nhad been despatched. But there was the regulation, and someone in\r\nauthority ruled that it had to apply in this most unusual instance. There\r\nis some pathos in a letter written by Mrs. Flinders to a friend in\r\nEngland (August, 1806) \"The Navy Board have thought proper to curtail my\r\nhusband's pay, so it behoves me to be as careful as I can; and I mean to\r\nbe very economical, being determined to do with as little as possible,\r\nthat he may not deem me an extravagant wife.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 25. THE ORDER OF RELEASE.\r\n\r\nThe several representations concerning the case of Flinders that were\r\nmade in France, the attention drawn to it in English newspapers, and the\r\nlively interest of learned men of both nations, produced a moving effect\r\nupon Napoleon's Government. Distinguished Frenchmen did not hesitate to\r\nspeak plainly. Fleurieu, whose voice was attentively heard on all matters\r\ntouching geography and discovery, declared publicly that \"the indignities\r\nimposed upon Captain Flinders were without example in the nautical\r\nhistory of civilised nations. Malte-Brun, a savant of the first rank,\r\nexpressed himself so boldly as to incur the displeasure of the\r\nauthorities. Bougainville, himself a famous navigator, made personal\r\nappeals to the Government. Sir Joseph Banks, whose friendly relations\r\nwith French men of science were not broken by the war, used all the\r\ninfluence he could command. He had already, \"from the gracious\r\ncondescension of the Emperor,\" obtained the release of five persons who\r\nhad been imprisoned in France,* and had no doubt that if he could get\r\nNapoleon's ear he could bring about the liberation of his protege. (*\r\nBanks to Flinders, Historical Records 5 646.)\r\n\r\nAt last, in March, 1806, the affair came before the Council of State in\r\nParis, mainly through the instrumentality of Bougainville. Banks wrote to\r\nMrs. Flinders:* (* Flinders' Papers.) \"After many refusals on the part of\r\nBonaparte to applications made to him from different quarters, he at last\r\nconsented to order Captain Flinders' case to be laid before the Council\r\nof State.\"\r\n\r\nOn the first of March an order was directed to be sent to Decaen,\r\napproving his previous conduct, but informing him that, moved \"by a\r\nsentiment of generosity, the Government accord to Captain Flinders his\r\nliberty and the restoration of his ship.\" Accompanying the despatch was\r\nan extract from the minutes of the Council of State, dated March 1st,\r\n1806, recording that: \"The Council of State, which, after the return of\r\nHis Majesty the Emperor and King, has considered the report of its Marine\r\nsection on that of the Minister of Marine and the Colonies concerning the\r\ndetention of the English schooner Cumberland and of Captain Flinders at\r\nIle-de-France (see the documents appended to the report), is of opinion\r\nthat the Captain-General of Ile-de-France had sufficient reason for\r\ndetaining there Captain Flinders and his schooner; but by reason of the\r\ninterest that the misfortunes of Captain Flinders has inspired, he seems\r\nto deserve that His Majesty should authorise the Minister of Marine and\r\nthe Colonies to restore to him his liberty and his ship.\" This document\r\nwas endorsed: \"Approuve au Palais des Tuileries, le onze Mars, 1806.\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON.\"\r\n\r\nThe terms of the despatch with which the order was transmitted contained\r\na remarkable statement. Decres informed Decaen that he, as Minister, had\r\non the 30th July, 1804--nearly one year and nine months before the order\r\nof release--brought Flinders' case under the notice of the Council of\r\nState. But nothing was done: the Emperor had to be consulted, and at that\r\ndate Napoleon was not accessible. He was superintending the army encamped\r\nat Boulogne, preparing for that projected descent upon England which even\r\nhis magnificent audacity never dared to make. He did not return to St.\r\nCloud, within hail of Paris, till October 12th.* (* The movements of\r\nNapoleon day by day can be followed in Schuerman's Itineraire General de\r\nNapoleon.) Then the officials surrounding him were kept busy with\r\npreparations for crowning himself and the Empress Josephine, a ceremony\r\nperformed by Pope Pius VII, at Notre Dame, on December 2nd. The\r\nconsequence was that this piece of business about an unfortunate English\r\ncaptain in Ile-de-France--like nearly all other business concerned with\r\nthe same colony at the time--got covered up beneath a mass of more urgent\r\naffairs, and remained in abeyance until the agitation stimulated by\r\nBanks, Fleurieu, Bougainville, Malte-Brun and others forced the case\r\nunder the attention of the Emperor and his ministers.\r\n\r\nEven then the despatch did not reach Ile-de-France till July, 1807,\r\nsixteen months after the date upon it; and it was then transmitted, not\r\nby a French ship, but by an English frigate, the Greyhound, under a flag\r\nof truce. The reason for that was unfortunate for Flinders as an\r\nindividual, but entirely due to the efficiency of the navy of which he\r\nwas an officer. In 1805 the British fleet had demolished the French at\r\nTrafalgar, and from that time forward until the end of the war, Great\r\nBritain was mistress of the ocean in full potency. Her frigates patrolled\r\nthe highways of the sea with a vigilance that never relaxed. In January,\r\n1806, she took possession of the Cape of Good Hope for the second time,\r\nand has held it ever since. The consequences to Decaen and his garrison\r\nwere very serious. With the British in force at the Cape, how could\r\nsupplies, reinforcements and despatches get through to him in\r\nIle-de-France? He saw the danger clearly, but was powerless to avert it.\r\nOf this particular despatch four copies were sent from France on as many\r\nships. One copy was borne by a French vessel which was promptly captured\r\nby the British; and on its contents becoming known the Admiralty sent it\r\nout to Admiral Pellew, in order that he might send a ship under a flag of\r\ntruce to take it to Decaen. The Secretary to the Admiralty, Marsden,\r\nwrote to Pellew (December, 1806) that the despatch \"has already been\r\ntransmitted to the Isle of France in triplicate, but as it may be hoped\r\nthat the vessels have been all captured you had better take an\r\nopportunity of sending this copy by a flag of truce, provided you have\r\nnot heard in the meantime of Flinders being at liberty.\" As a fact, one\r\nother copy did get through, on a French vessel.\r\n\r\nPellew lost no time in informing Flinders of the news, and the captive\r\nwrote to Decaen in the following terms:* (* Decaen Papers.)\r\n\r\n\"July 24, 1807.\r\n\r\n\"General,\r\n\r\n\"By letters from Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew, transmitted to me\r\nyesterday by Colonel Monistrol, I am informed that orders relating to me\r\nhave at length arrived from His Excellency the Marine Minister of France,\r\nwhich orders are supposed to authorize my being set at liberty.\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency will doubtless be able to figure to yourself the\r\nsensations such a communication must have excited in me, after a\r\ndetention of three years and a half, and my anxiety to have such\r\nagreeable intelligence confirmed by some information of the steps it is\r\nin Your Excellency's contemplation to take in consequence. If these\r\nletters have flattered me in vain with the hopes of returning to my\r\ncountry and my family, I beg of you, General, to inform me; if they are\r\ncorrect, you will complete my happiness by confirming their contents. The\r\nstate of incertitude in which I have so long remained will, I trust, be\r\nadmitted as a sufficient excuse for my anxiety to be delivered from it.\r\n\r\n\"I have the honour to be, Your Excellency's most obedient humble servant,\r\n\r\n\"MATTW. FLINDERS.\r\n\r\n\"His Excellency the Captain-General Decaen.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply Decaen transmitted to Flinders a copy of the despatch of the\r\nMinister of Marine, and informed him through Colonel Monistrol \"that, so\r\nsoon as circumstances will permit, you will fully enjoy the favour which\r\nhas been granted you by His Majesty the Emperor and King.\"\r\n\r\nBut now, having at length received orders, countersigned by Napoleon\r\nhimself, that Flinders should be liberated, Decaen came to a decision\r\nthat on the face of it seems extremely perplexing. We have seen that in\r\nAugust, 1805, Flinders, well informed by persons who had conversed with\r\nDecaen, believed that the General \"would be very glad to get handsomely\r\nclear of me,\" and that in November of the same year he made the assertion\r\nthat Decaen \"would have gladly suffered me to depart long since\" but for\r\nthe reference of the case to Paris. We have direct evidence to the same\r\neffect in a letter from Colonel Monistrol regarding Lord Wellesley's\r\napplication for Flinders' release.* (* Historical Records 5 651.) The\r\nColonel desired \"with all my heart\" that the request could be acceded to,\r\nbut the Captain-General could not comply until he had received a response\r\nto his despatch. Yet, when the response was received, and Flinders might\r\nhave been liberated with the full approbation of the French Government,\r\nDecaen replied to the Minister's despatch in the following terms (August\r\n20th, 1807):\r\n\r\n\"I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that by the English frigate\r\nGreyhound, which arrived here on July 21st under a flag of truce, in the\r\nhope of gathering information concerning His British Majesty's ships\r\nBlenheim and Java, I have received the fourth copy of Your Excellency's\r\ndespatch of March 21st, 1806, Number 8, relative to Captain Flinders.\r\nHaving thought that the favourable decision that it contains regarding\r\nthat officer had been determined at a time when the possibility of some\r\nrenewal of friendliness with England was perceived, I did not consider\r\nthat the present moment was favourable for putting into operation that\r\nact of indulgence on the part of His Majesty. I have since received the\r\nsecond copy of the same despatch; but, the circumstances having become\r\nstill more difficult, and that officer appearing to me to be always\r\ndangerous, I await a more propitious time for putting into execution the\r\nintentions of His Majesty. My zeal for his service has induced me to\r\nsuspend the operations of his command. I trust, Monsieur, that that\r\nmeasure of prudence will obtain your Excellency's approbation. I have the\r\nhonour to be, etc., etc., etc., DECAEN.\"* (* This despatch was originally\r\npublished by M. Albert Pitot, in his Esquisses Historiques de\r\nl'Ile-de-France. Port Louis, 1899.)\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that in this despatch Decaen describes the\r\ncircumstances of the colony he governed as having become \"more\r\ndifficult,\" and Flinders as appearing to him to be \"always dangerous.\" We\r\nmust, then, examine the circumstances to ascertain why they had become so\r\ndifficult, and why he considered that it would now be dangerous to let\r\nFlinders go.\r\n\r\nIt is easy enough to attribute the General's refusal to obstinacy or\r\nmalignity. But his anger had cooled down by 1807; his prisoner was a\r\ncharge on the establishment to the extent of 5400 francs a year, and\r\nDecaen was a thrifty administrator; why, then, should he apparently have\r\nhardened his heart to the extent of disobeying the Emperor's command? The\r\nexplanation is not to be found in his temper, but in the military\r\nsituation of Ile-de-France, and his belief that Flinders was accurately\r\ninformed about it; as was, indeed, the case.\r\n\r\nAt this time Decaen was holding Ile-de-France by a policy fairly\r\ndescribable as one of \"bluff.\" The British could have taken it by\r\nthrowing upon it a comparatively small force, had they known how weak its\r\ndefences were. But they did not know; and Decaen, whose duty it was to\r\ndefend the place to the utmost, did not intend that they should if he\r\ncould prevent information reaching them. After the crushing of French\r\nnaval power at Trafalgar and the British occupation of the Cape, Decaen's\r\nposition became untenable, though a capitulation was not forced upon him\r\ntill four years later. He constantly demanded reinforcements and money,\r\nwhich never came to hand. The military and financial resources of France\r\nwere being strained to prosecute Napoleon's wars in Europe. There were\r\nneither men nor funds to spare for the colony in the Indian Ocean. Decaen\r\nfelt that his position was compromised.* (* \"Il sentait sa position\r\ncompromise.\" Prentout page 521; who gives an excellent account of the\r\nsituation.) He addressed the Emperor personally \"with all the sadness of\r\na wounded soul,\" but nothing was done for Ile-de-France. There was not\r\nenough money to repair public buildings and quays, which fell into ruins.\r\nThere was no timber, no sail-cloth to re-fit ships. Even nails were\r\nlacking. A little later (1809) he complained in despatches of the\r\nshortness of flour and food. There was little revenue, no credit. Now\r\nthat the British had asserted their strength, and held the Cape, prizes\r\nwere few. Above all he represented \"the urgent need for soldiers.\" He\r\nfelt himself abandoned. But still, with a resolute tenacity that one\r\ncannot but admire, he hung on to his post, and maintained a bold front to\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nDid Flinders know of this state of things? Unquestionably he did; and\r\nDecaen knew that he knew. He could have informed the British Government,\r\nhad he chosen to violate his parole; but he was in all things a\r\nscrupulously honourable man, and, as he said, \"an absolute silence was\r\nmaintained in my letters.\" He was constantly hoping that an attack would\r\nbe made upon the island, and \"if attacked with judgment it appeared to me\r\nthat a moderate force would carry it.\"* (* Voyage to Terra Australis 2\r\n419.) But all this while the British believed that Ile-de-France was\r\nstrong, and that a successful assault upon it would require a larger\r\nforce than they could spare at the time. Even after Flinders had returned\r\nto England, when he was asked at the Admiralty whether he thought that a\r\ncontemplated attack would succeed, his confident assurance that it would\r\nwas received with doubt. Decaen's \"bluff\" was superb.\r\n\r\nOn one point, if we may believe St. Elme le Duc, Decaen did Flinders a\r\ngrave injustice. It was believed, says that writer's manuscript, that\r\nFlinders had several times managed to go out at night, that he had made\r\nsoundings along the coast, and had transmitted information to Bengal\r\nwhich was of use when ultimately the colony was taken by the English. For\r\nthat charge there is not a shadow of warrant. There is not the faintest\r\nground for supposing that he did not observe his parole with the utmost\r\nstrictness. Had he supplied information, Ile-de-France would have passed\r\nunder British rule long before 1810.* (* The belief that Flinders took\r\nsoundings appears to have been common among the French inhabitants of\r\nPort Louis. In the Proceedings of the South Australian Branch of the\r\nRoyal Geographical Society, 1912 to 1913 page 71, is printed a brief\r\naccount of the detention of Flinders, by a contemporary, D'Epinay, a\r\nlawyer of the town. Here it is stated: \"It is found out that at night he\r\ntakes soundings off the coast and has forwarded his notes to India.\"\r\nThose who gave credence to this wild story apparently never reflected\r\nthat Flinders had no kind of opportunity for taking soundings.)\r\n\r\nA few passages written for inclusion in the Voyage to Terra Australis,\r\nbut for some reason omitted, may be quoted to show how rigorously\r\nvisiting ships were treated lest information should leak out.* (*\r\nManuscript, Mitchell Library.)\r\n\r\n\"It may not be amiss to mention the rules which a ship is obliged to\r\nobserve on arriving at Port North-West, since it will of itself give some\r\nidea of the nature of the Government. The ship is boarded by a pilot one\r\nor two miles from the entrance to the port, who informs the commander\r\nthat no person must go on shore, or any one be suffered to come on board\r\nuntil the ship has been visited by the officer of health, who comes soon\r\nafter the ship has arrived at anchor in the mouth of the port,\r\naccompanied with an officer from the captain of the port, and, if it is a\r\nforeign ship, by an interpreter. If the health of the crew presents no\r\nobjection, and after answering the questions put to him concerning the\r\nobject of his coming to the island, the commander goes on shore in the\r\nFrench boat, and is desired to take with him all papers containing\r\npolitical information, and all letters, whether public or private, that\r\nare on board the vessel; and although there should be several parcels of\r\nnewspapers of the same date, they must all go. On arriving at the\r\nGovernment House, to which he is accompanied by the officer and\r\ninterpreter, and frequently by a guard, he sooner or later sees the\r\nGovernor, or one of his aides-de-camp, who questions him upon his voyage,\r\nupon political intelligence, the vessels he has met at sea, his\r\nintentions in touching at the island, etc.; after which he is desired to\r\nleave his letters, packets, and newspapers, no matter to whom they are\r\naddressed. If he refuse this, or to give all the information he knows,\r\nhowever detrimental it may be to his own affairs, or appears to\r\nequivocate, if he escapes being imprisoned in the town he is sent back to\r\nhis ship under a guard, and forbidden all communication with the shore.\r\nIf he gives satisfaction, he is conducted from the General to the\r\nPrefect, to answer his questions, and if he satisfies him also, is then\r\nleft at liberty to go to his consul and transact his business. The\r\nletters and packets left with the General, if not addressed to persons\r\nobnoxious to the Government, are sent unopened, according to their\r\ndirection. I will not venture to say that the others are opened and\r\nafterwards destroyed, but it is much suspected. If the newspapers contain\r\nno intelligence but what is permitted to be known, they are also sent to\r\ntheir address. The others are retained; and for this reason it is that\r\nall the copies of the same paper are demanded, for the intention is not\r\nmerely to gain intelligence, but to prevent what is disagreeable from\r\nbeing circulated.\"\r\n\r\nDecaen's conduct in refusing to liberate Flinders when the order reached\r\nhim need not be excused, but it should be understood. To impute sheer\r\nmalignity to him does not help us much, nor does it supply a sufficient\r\nmotive. What we know of his state of mind, as well as what we know of the\r\nfinancial position of the colony, induce the belief that he would have\r\nbeen quite glad to get rid of Flinders in 1807, had not other and\r\nstronger influences intervened. But he was a soldier, placed in an\r\nexceedingly precarious situation, which he could only maintain by\r\ndetermining not to lose a single chance. War is an affliction that\r\nscourges a larger number of those who do not fight than of those who do;\r\nand Flinders, with all his innocence, was one of its victims. He was\r\nthought to know too much. That was why he was \"dangerous.\" A learned\r\nFrench historian* stigmatises Decaen's conduct as \"maladroit and brutal,\r\nbut not dishonest.\" (* Prentout page 661.) Dishonest he never was; as to\r\nthe other terms we need not dispute so long as we understand the peculiar\r\ntwist of circumstances that intensified the maladroitness and brutality\r\nthat marked the man, and without which, indeed, he would not perhaps have\r\nbeen the dogged, tough, hard-fighting, resolute soldier that he was.\r\n\r\nFlinders could have escaped from Ile-de-France on several occasions, had\r\nhe chosen to avail himself of opportunities. He did not, for two reasons,\r\nboth in the highest degree honourable to him. The first was that he had\r\ngiven his parole, and would not break it; the second that escape would\r\nhave meant sacrificing some of his precious papers. In May, 1806, an\r\nAmerican captain rejoicing in the name of Gamaliel Matthew Ward called at\r\nPort Louis, and hearing of Flinders' case, actually made arrangements for\r\nremoving him. It was Flinders himself who prevented the daring skipper\r\nfrom carrying out his plan. \"The dread of dishonouring my parole,\" he\r\nwrote, \"made me contemplate this plan with a fearful eye.\"* (* Flinders'\r\nPapers.) In December of the same year he wrote to John Aken: \"Since I\r\nfind so much time elapse, and no attention paid to my situation by the\r\nFrench Government, I have been very heartily sorry for having given my\r\nparole, as I could otherwise have made my escape long ago.\" Again, he\r\nwrote to his wife: \"Great risks must be run and sacrifices made, but my\r\nhonour shall remain unstained. No captain in His Majesty's Navy shall\r\nhave cause to blush in calling me a brother officer.\"\r\n\r\nAs time went on, and release was not granted, he several times thought of\r\nsurrendering his parole, which would have involved giving up the pleasant\r\nlife at Wilhelm's Plains, and being again confined in Port Louis. But\r\nescape would have meant the loss of many of his papers, the authentic\r\nrecords of his discoveries; and he could not bring himself to face that.\r\n\r\nConsequently the captivity dragged itself wearily out for three years\r\nafter the order of release was received. The victim chafed, protested,\r\nleft no stone unturned, but Decaen was not to be moved. Happily\r\ndepression did not drag illness in its miserable train. \"My health\r\nsustains itself tolerably well in the midst of all my disappointments,\"\r\nhe was able to write to Banks in 1809.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 26. THE RELEASE.\r\n\r\nFrom June, 1809, the British squadron in the Indian Ocean commenced to\r\nblockade Ile-de-France.* (* Flinders to Banks, Historical Records 7 202.)\r\nDecaen's fear of Flinders' knowledge is revealed in the fact that he\r\nordered him not for the future to go beyond the lands attached to Madame\r\nD'Arifat's habitation. Flinders wrote complying, and henceforth declined\r\ninvitations beyond the immediate neighbourhood of the plantation. He\r\namused himself by teaching mathematics and the principles of navigation\r\nto the two younger sons of the family, and by the study of French\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nAfter October the blockade increased in strictness, under Commodore\r\nRowley. Decaen's situation was growing desperate. Fortunately for him,\r\nthe French squadron brought in three prizes in January, 1810, slipping\r\npast Rowley's blockade, much to that enterprising officer's annoyance.\r\nThe situation was temporarily relieved, but the assistance thus afforded\r\nwas no better than a plaster on a large wound. Here again we find\r\nFlinders accurately and fully informed: Decaen did not underrate his\r\n\"dangerous\" potentialities. \"The ordinary sources of revenue and\r\nemolument were nearly dried up, and to have recourse to the merchants for\r\na loan was impossible, the former bills upon the French treasury, drawn\r\nit was said for three millions of livres, remaining in great part unpaid;\r\nand to such distress was the Captain-General reduced for ways and means\r\nthat he had submitted to ask a voluntary contribution in money, wheat,\r\nmaize, or any kind of produce from the half-ruined colonists. It was even\r\nsaid to have been promised that, if pecuniary succour did not arrive in\r\nsix months, the Captain-General would retire and leave the inhabitants to\r\ngovern themselves.\"\r\n\r\nDecaen, in fact, saw clearly that the game was up. His threat to retire\r\nin six months did not mean that he would not have given the British a\r\nfight before he lowered the tricolour. He was not the man to surrender\r\nquite tamely; but he knew that he could no longer hold out for more than\r\na measurable period, the length of which would depend upon the enemy's\r\ninitiative.\r\n\r\nThere was, therefore, no longer any purpose in prolonging the captivity\r\nof the prisoner who was feared on account of his knowledge of the\r\nsituation; and Decaen availed himself of the first opportunity presented\r\nin 1810 to grant Flinders his longed-for release. In March, Mr. Hugh Hope\r\nwas sent to Ile-de-France by Lord Minto (who had become Governor-General\r\nof India in 1807) to negotiate for the exchange of prisoners. This\r\ngentleman had done his best to secure Flinders' release on a former\r\noccasion, and had been refused. But now Decaen realised that the end was\r\ndrawing near, and there was no sound military purpose to serve in keeping\r\nthe prisoner any longer. It is quite probable that he would have been\r\nglad if information had been conveyed to the British which would expedite\r\nthe inevitable fight and the consequent fall of French power in\r\nMauritius.\r\n\r\nOn March 15th Flinders received a letter from Mr. Hope informing him that\r\nthe Governor had consented to his liberation. A fortnight later came\r\nofficial confirmation of the news in a letter from Colonel Monistrol, who\r\nassured him of the pleasure he had in making the announcement. His joy\r\nwas great. At once he visited his French friends in the neighbourhood to\r\ngive them the news and bid them farewell; next day he took an\r\naffectionate leave of the kind family who had been his hosts for four\r\nyears and a half; and as soon as possible he departed for Port Louis,\r\nwhere he stayed with his friend Pitot until he went aboard the cartel. At\r\nthe end of the month a dinner was given in his honour by the president of\r\nthe Societe D'Emulation, to which a large number of English men and women\r\nwere invited. When Flinders arrived in Ile-de-France, more than six years\r\nbefore, he could speak no French and could only decipher a letter in that\r\nlanguage with the aid of a dictionary; but now, when he found himself\r\nagain in the company of his own countrymen, he experienced a difficulty\r\nin speaking English!\r\n\r\nOn June 13th, Flinders' sword was restored to him. He was required to\r\nsign a parole, wherein he pledged himself not to act in any service which\r\nmight be considered as directly or indirectly hostile to France or her\r\nallies during the present war. On the same day the cartel Harriet sailed\r\nfor Bengal. Flinders was free: \"after a captivity of six years five\r\nmonths and twenty-seven days I at length had the inexpressible pleasure\r\nof being out of the reach of General Decaen.\"\r\n\r\nRowley's blockading squadron was cruising outside the port, and the\r\nHarriet communicated with the commodore. It was ascertained that the\r\nsloop Otter was running down to the Cape with despatches on the following\r\nday, and Flinders had no difficulty in securing a passage in her. After\r\ndining with Rowley he was transferred to the Otter. He was delayed for\r\nsix weeks at the Cape, but in August embarked in the Olympia, and arrived\r\nin England on the 23rd of October, after an absence of nine years and\r\nthree months.\r\n\r\nNews of his release had preceded him, and his wife had come up from\r\nLincolnshire to meet him. He speaks in a letter to a friend of the\r\nmeeting with the woman whom he had left a bride so many years before:* (*\r\nFlinders' Papers.) \"I had the extreme good fortune to find Mrs. Flinders\r\nin London, which I owe to the intelligence of my liberty having preceded\r\nmy arrival. I need not describe to you our meeting after an absence of\r\nnearly ten years. Suffice it to say I have been gaining flesh ever\r\nsince.\" John Franklin, then a midshipman on the Bedford, had come up to\r\nLondon to welcome his old commander, and, much to his disturbance,\r\nwitnessed the meeting of Flinders and his wife, as we find from a letter\r\nwritten by him: \"Some apology would be necessary for the abrupt manner in\r\nwhich I left you, except in the peculiar circumstances wherein my\r\ndeparture was taken. I felt so sensibly the affecting scene of your\r\nmeeting Mrs. Flinders that I would not have remained any longer in the\r\nroom under any consideration.\"\r\n\r\nThe capture of Ile-de-France by the British, when ultimately an attack\r\nwas made (on 3rd December, 1810), gave peculiar pleasure to naval\r\nofficers and Anglo-Indians. \"It is incredible,\" Mr. Hope wrote to\r\nFlinders, \"the satisfaction which the capture of that island has diffused\r\nall over India, and everyone is now surprised that an enterprise of such\r\nimportance should never have been attempted before.\" When the change of\r\nrulers took place, some of the French inhabitants objected to take the\r\noath of allegiance to the British Crown, and a letter on the subject was\r\nsent to Napoleon. His comment was pithy: \"I should like to see anybody\r\nrefuse me the oath of allegiance in any country I conquered!\"* (*\r\nFlinders' Papers.)\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to deal at this point with the oft-repeated charge,\r\nto which reference has been made previously, that charts were taken from\r\nFlinders during his imprisonment, and were used in the preparation of the\r\nAtlas to Peron and Freycinets' Voyage de Decouvertes aux Terres\r\nAustrales.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that no charts were at any time taken from the trunks\r\nwherein they were deposited in 1803, except by Flinders himself, nor was\r\na single one of his charts ever seen by any French officer unless he\r\nhimself showed it. He never made any such charge of dishonesty against\r\nhis enemy, Decaen, or against the General's countrymen. He had, as will\r\nbe seen, a cause of grievance against Freycinet, who was responsible for\r\nthe French charts, and gave voice to it; but plagiarism was neither\r\nalleged nor suspected by him.\r\n\r\nOn each occasion when Flinders applied to Decaen to be supplied with\r\npapers from the trunks, he gave a formal receipt for them. The first\r\noccasion when papers were removed was on December 18th, 1803, when\r\nFlinders took from one of his trunks his Cumberland log-book, in order\r\nthat Decaen might ascertain from it his reasons for calling at\r\nIle-de-France. It was never restored to him. Mr. Hope made application\r\nfor it in 1810, when he was set free, but Decaen did not give it up; and\r\nin 1813 Decres was still demanding it unavailingly. This book and the box\r\nof despatches were the only papers of Flinders that Decaen ever saw. When\r\nit was handed over, all other books and papers were replaced in the\r\ntrunk, \"and sealed as before.\" The second occasion was on December 27th,\r\n1803, when the trunk containing printed books was restored to Flinders at\r\nhis request in order that he might employ himself in confinement at the\r\nPort Louis tavern. The third occasion was on December 29th, when he was\r\nconducted to Government House, and was allowed to take out of the sealed\r\ntrunk there his private letters and journals, two log-books, and other\r\nmemoranda necessary to enable him to construct a chart of the Gulf of\r\nCarpentaria. All other papers were \"locked up in the trunk and sealed as\r\nbefore.\" The fourth occasion was in July, 1804, when Flinders was allowed\r\nto take out of the same trunk a quantity of other books, papers and\r\ncharts, which he required for the pursuit of his work. For these also a\r\nreceipt was duly given. In that instance Flinders was especially\r\nvigilant. He had received a private warning that some of his charts had\r\nbeen copied, but when the seals were broken and he examined the contents\r\nhe was satisfied that this was not true. He asked Colonel Monistrol, an\r\nhonourable gentleman who was always of friendly disposition, whether the\r\npapers had been disturbed, and \"he answered by an unqualified negative.\"\r\nThe fifth occasion was in August, 1807, when all the remaining papers,\r\nexcept the log-book and the despatches, were restored to him. He then\r\ngave the following receipt:* (* Decaen Papers.)\r\n\r\n\"Received from Colonel Monistrol, chef d'etat-major general of the Isle\r\nof France, one trunk containing the remainder of the books, papers, etc.,\r\nwhich were taken from me in Port North-West on December 16th, 1803, and\r\nDecember 20th of the same year, whether relating to my voyage of\r\ndiscovery or otherwise; which books and papers, with those received by me\r\nat two different times in 1804, make up the whole that were so taken;\r\nwith the following exceptions: First, Various letters and papers, either\r\nwholly or in part destroyed by rats, of which the remains are in the\r\ntrunk. Second, The third volume of my rough log-books, containing the\r\njournal of my transactions and observations on board the Investigator,\r\nthe Porpoise, the Hope cutter, and the Cumberland schooner, from some\r\ntime in June, 1803, to December 16th, 1803, of which I have no duplicate.\r\nThird, Two boxes of despatches; the one from his Excellency Governor King\r\nof New South Wales, addressed to His Majesty's principal Secretary of\r\nState for the Colonies; the other from Colonel Paterson,\r\nLieutenant-Governor at Port Jackson, the address of which I do not\r\nremember. In truth of which I hereunto sign my name at Port Napoleon,\r\nIsle of France this 24th day of August, 1807.\r\n\r\n\"MATTW. FLINDERS,\r\n\r\n\"Late commander of H.M. Sloop the Investigator, employed on discoveries\r\nto the South Seas, with a French passport.\"\r\n\r\nThe papers which the rats had destroyed were not described; but there is\r\na letter of Flinders to the Admiralty, written after his return to\r\nEngland (November 8th, 1810), which informs us what they were.* (*\r\nFlinders' Papers.) In this letter he explained that, when the trunk\r\ncontaining the papers was restored, \"I found the rats had gotten into the\r\ntrunk and made nests of some of them. I transmitted the whole from the\r\nIsle of France in the state they then were, and now find that some of the\r\npapers necessary to the passing of my accounts as commander and purser of\r\nHis Majesty's sloop Investigator are wanting. I have therefore to request\r\nyou will lay my case before their Lordships and issue an order to\r\ndispense with the papers which from the above circumstances it is\r\nimpossible for me to produce.\" It is apparent, therefore, that none of\r\nthe navigation papers or charts were destroyed. Had any been abstracted\r\nFlinders, who was a punctiliously exact man, would have missed them. His\r\nintense feeling of resentment against Decaen would have caused him to\r\ncall attention to the fact if any papers whatever had been disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe Quarterly Review pointed out the circumstance that the French charts\r\nwere \"VERY LIKE\" those of Flinders, giving sinister emphasis to the words\r\nin italics. They were very like in so far as they were good. It is\r\nevident that if two navigators sail along the same piece of coast, and\r\neach constructs a chart of it, those charts will be \"very like\" each\r\nother to exactly the degree in which they accurately represent the coast\r\ncharted. Freycinet, who did much of the hydrographical work on Baudin's\r\nexpedition, was an eminently competent officer. Wherever we find him in\r\ncharge of a section, the work is well done. His Atlas contained some\r\nextremely beautiful work. There is no reason whatever for suggesting that\r\nit was not his own work. He certainly saw no chart of Flinders, except\r\nthe one shown to him at Port Jackson, until the Atlas to the Voyage to\r\nTerra Australis was published.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the reports and material prepared by Baudin's cartographers,\r\nupon which Freycinet worked, are in existence. The reports* to the\r\ncommander give detailed descriptions of sections of the Australian coast\r\ntraversed and charted, and show conclusively that some parts were\r\nexamined with thoroughness. (* I have read the whole of these reports\r\nfrom copies of the originals in the Depot de la Marine, Service\r\nHydrographique, Paris, but have not thought it necessary to make further\r\nuse of them in this book.) For regions in which Baudin's expeditions\r\nsailed, Freycinet had no need to resort to Flinders' material. He had\r\nenough of his own. The papers of Flinders which Freycinet might have\r\nwished to see were those relating to the Gulf of Carpentaria, Torres\r\nStrait, and the Queensland coast, which Baudin's vessels did not explore.\r\nBut the French maps contain no new features in respect to these parts.\r\nThey present no evidence that Freycinet was acquainted with the\r\ndiscoveries made there by Flinders.\r\n\r\nThe accusation of plagiarism arose partly from the intense animosity felt\r\nagainst Frenchmen by English writers in a period of fierce national\r\nhatred; partly from natural resentment of the treatment accorded to\r\nFlinders; partly from the circumstance that, while he was held in\r\ncaptivity, French maps were published which appeared to claim credit for\r\ndiscoveries made by him; and partly from a misunderstanding of a charge\r\nvery boldly launched by an eminent French geographer. Malte-Brun, in his\r\nAnnales des Voyages for 1814 (Volume 23 page 268) made an attack upon the\r\nFrench Atlas. He detested the Napoleonic regime, and published his\r\nobservations while Napoleon was in exile at Elba. He pointed out the\r\nwrong done to Flinders in labelling the southern coast of Australia\r\n\"Terre Napoleon,\" and in giving French names to geographical features of\r\nwhich Flinders, not Baudin, was the discoverer. He continued: \"the motive\r\nfor that species of national plagiarism* is evident. (* \"Le motif de\r\ncette espece de plagiat national.\") The Government wished to create for\r\nitself a title for the occupation of that part of New Holland.\"\r\nMalte-Brun should have known Napoleon better than that. When he wanted\r\nterritory, and was strong enough to take it, he did not \"create titles.\"\r\nHe took: his title was the sword.\r\n\r\nBut the point of importance is that Malte-Brun did not allege\r\n\"plagiarism\" against the authors of the French maps. His charge was made\r\nagainst the Government. It was not that Freycinet had plagiarised\r\nFlinders' charts, but that the Government had plagiarised his discoveries\r\nby, as Malte-Brun thought, ordering French names to be strewn along the\r\nTerre Napoleon coasts. In a later issue of the Annales des Voyages*\r\nMalte-Brun testified to having seen Freycinet working at the material\r\nupon which his charts were founded. (* Volume 24 273.) But his former use\r\nof the word \"plagiat\" had created a general impression that Flinders'\r\ncharts had been dishonestly taken from him in Mauritius, and used by\r\nthose responsible for the French maps; a charge which Malte-Brun never\r\nmeant to make, and which, though still very commonly stated and believed,\r\nis wholly untrue.\r\n\r\nThe really deplorable feature of the affair is that Peron and Freycinet,\r\nin their published book and atlas, gave no credit to Flinders for\r\ndiscoveries which they knew perfectly that he had made. They knew where\r\nhe was while they were working up their material. It does not appear that\r\neither of them ever moved in the slightest degree to try to secure his\r\nliberation. Peron died in December, 1810. Malte-Brun, who saw him\r\nfrequently after the return of Baudin's expedition, says that in\r\nconversation on the discoveries of Flinders, Peron \"always appeared to me\r\nto be agitated by a secret sorrow, and has given me to understand that he\r\nregretted not being at liberty to say in that regard all that he knew.\"\r\nFlinders also believed Peron to be a worthy man who acted as he did \"from\r\noverruling authority.\" Those who have read the evidence printed in this\r\nbook, exhibiting the detestable conduct of both Peron and Freycinet in\r\nrepaying indulgence and hospitality by base espionage, will hardly be\r\nprecipitate in crediting either of them with immaculate motives. There is\r\nno evidence that authority was exercised to induce them to name the\r\nsouthern coasts Terre Napoleon, or to give the name Golfe Bonaparte to\r\nthe Spencer's Gulf of Flinders, that of Golfe Josephine to his St.\r\nVincent's Gulf, that of Ile Decres to his Kangaroo Island, that of\r\nDetroit de Lacepede to his Investigator Strait, and so forth. They knew\r\nthat Flinders had made these discoveries before their own ships appeared\r\nin the same waters; they knew that only the fact of his imprisonment\r\nprevented his charts from being published before theirs. The names with\r\nwhich they adorned their maps were a piece of courtiership and a means of\r\ncurrying favour with the great and powerful, just as their espionage, and\r\ntheir supply of illicitly-obtained and flavoured information to Decaen in\r\nMauritius, were essays to advance their own interests by unworthy\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nFreycinet's anxiety to get his maps out before Flinders had time to\r\npublish is curiously exhibited in a letter from him to the Minister of\r\nMarine (August 29th, 1811). Flinders was then back in England, hard at\r\nwork upon his charts. A volume of text, and one thin book of plates,\r\ncontaining only two maps, had been published at Paris in 1807. Then delay\r\noccurred, and in 1811 the engravers, not having been paid for their work,\r\nrefused to continue. Freycinet appealed to the Minister in these terms:*\r\n(* Manuscripts, Archives Nationales, Marine BB4 996.) \"Very powerful\r\nreasons, Monsieur, appear to demand that the atlas should be published\r\nwith very little delay, and even before the text which is to accompany\r\nit. Independently of the advantages to me personally as author, of which\r\nI shall not speak, the reputation of the expedition ordered by His\r\nMajesty appears to me to be strongly involved. I have the honour to\r\nremind your Excellency that Captain Flinders was sent on discovery to\r\nTerra Australis a short while after the French Government had despatched\r\nan expedition having the same object. The rival expeditions carried out\r\ntheir work in the same field, but the French had the good fortune to be\r\nthe first to return to Europe. Now that Flinders is again in England, and\r\nis occupied with the publication of the numerous results of his voyage,\r\nthe English Government, jealous on account of the rivalry between the two\r\nexpeditions, will do all it can for its own. The conjectures I have\r\nformed acquire a new force by the recent announcement made by the\r\nnewspapers, that Captain Flinders' voyages in the South Seas are to be\r\npublished by command of the Lords of the Admiralty. If the English\r\npublish before the French the records of discoveries made in New Holland,\r\nthey will, by the fact of that priority of publication, take from us the\r\nglory which we have a right to claim. The reputation of our expedition\r\ndepends wholly upon the success of our geographical work, and the more\r\nnearly our operations and those of the English approach perfection, and\r\nthe more nearly our charts resemble each other, the more likelihood there\r\nis of our being accused of plagiarism, or at all events of giving rise to\r\nthe thought that the English charts were necessary to aid us in\r\nconstructing ours; because there will be no other apparent motive for the\r\ndelay of our publication.\"\r\n\r\nHere, it will be seen, Freycinet anticipated the charge of plagiarism,\r\nbut thought it would spring from the prior publication of Flinders'\r\ncharts. He had no suspicion at this time that the accusation would be\r\nmade that he used charts improperly taken from Flinders when he was under\r\nthe thumb of Decaen; and when this unjust impeachment was launched a few\r\nyears later he repudiated it with strong indignation. In that he was\r\njustified; and our sympathy with him would be keener if his own record in\r\nother respects had been brighter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 27. LAST YEARS AND DEATH OF FLINDERS.\r\n\r\nOne of the first matters which occupied Flinders after his arrival in\r\nEngland was the use of his influence with the Admiralty to secure the\r\nrelease of a few French prisoners of war who were relatives of his\r\nfriends in Mauritius. In a letter he pointed out that these men were\r\nconnected with respectable families from whom he himself and several\r\nother English prisoners had received kindness.* (* Flinders' Papers.) His\r\nplea was successful. There was, surely, a peculiar beauty in this act of\r\nsympathy on the part of one who had so recently felt the pain and\r\ndistress of captivity.\r\n\r\nFlinders was anxious for news about his old Investigator shipmates. The\r\nfaithful Elder, he found, had secured an appointment as servant to\r\nAdmiral Hollowell, then on service in the Mediterranean, and was a great\r\nfavourite. Franklin was able to enlighten him as to some of the others.\r\nPurdie, who had been assistant-surgeon, was surgeon on the Pompey. Inman,\r\nwho had been sent out to act as astronomer during the latter part of the\r\nvoyage, was a professor at the Naval College, Portsmouth. Lacy and\r\nSinclair, midshipmen, were dead. Louth was a midshipman on the Warrior.\r\nOlive was purser on the Heir Apparent, and Matt, the carpenter, filled\r\nthat post on the Bellerophon. Of Dr. Bell Franklin knew nothing. \"The old\r\nship,\" he said, \"is lying at Portsmouth, cut down nearly to the water's\r\nedge.\"\r\n\r\nIn naval and scientific circles Flinders was the object of much honour\r\nand interest. He was received \"with flattering attention\" at the\r\nAdmiralty. We find him visiting Lord Spencer, who, having authorised the\r\nInvestigator voyage, was naturally concerned to hear of its eventful\r\nhistory. Banks took him to the Royal Society and gave a dinner in his\r\nhonour. The Duke of Clarence, afterwards William IV, himself a sailor,\r\nwished to meet him and inspect his charts, and he was taken to see the\r\nPrince by Bligh. In 1812 he gave evidence before a Committee of the House\r\nof Commons on the penal transportation system.* (* House of Commons\r\nPapers, 1812; the evidence was given on March 25th.) What he had to say\r\nrelated principally to the nature of the country he had examined in the\r\ncourse of his explorations. \"Were you acquainted with Port Dalrymple?\"\r\nthe chairman asked him. \"I discovered Port Dalrymple.\" \"Were you ever at\r\nthe Derwent?\" \"I was, and from my report, I believe, it was that the\r\nfirst settlement was made there.\" He was one of the few early explorers\r\nof Australia whose vision was hopeful; and experience has in every\r\ninstance justified his foreseeing optimism.\r\n\r\nBut save for a few social events, and for some valuable experiments with\r\nthe magnetic needle, to be referred to in the final chapter, his time and\r\nenergies were absorbed by work upon his charts. He laboured incessantly.\r\n\"I am at my voyage,\" he said in a letter, \"but it does by no means\r\nadvance according to my wishes. Morning, noon and night I sit close at\r\nwriting, and at my charts, and can hardly find time for anything else.\"\r\nHe was a merciless critic when the proofs came from the engravers. One\r\nhalf-sheet contains 92 corrections and improving marks in his\r\nhandwriting. Such directions as \"make the dot distinct,\" \"strengthen the\r\ncoast-line,\" \"make this track a fair equal line,\" \"points wanting,\" are\r\nabundant. As we turn over the great folio which represents so much\r\nlabour, so much endurance, so much suffering, it is good to remember that\r\nthese superb drawings are the result of the ceaselessly patient toil of\r\nperhaps the most masterly cartographer who has ever adorned the British\r\nnaval service.\r\n\r\nHe took similar pains with the text of A Voyage to Terra Australis. It\r\nwas never meant to be a book for popular reading, though there is no lack\r\nof entertainment in it. It was a semi-official publication, in which the\r\nAdmiralty claimed and retained copyright, and its author was perhaps a\r\nlittle hampered by that circumstance. Bligh asked that it should be\r\ndedicated to him, but \"the honour was declined.\"* (* Flinders' Papers.)\r\nThe book was produced under the direction of a committee appointed by the\r\nAdmiralty, consisting of Banks, Barrow, and Flinders himself.\r\n\r\nIt abounds in exact data concerning the latitude and longitude of coastal\r\nfeatures. The English is everywhere clear and sound; but the book which\r\nFlinders could have written had he lived a few years longer, if it had\r\nbeen penned with the freedom which made his conversation so delightful to\r\nhis friends, might have been one of the most entertaining pieces of\r\ntravel literature in the language. At first he was somewhat apprehensive\r\nabout authorship, and thought of calling in the aid of a friend; but the\r\nenforced leisure of Ile-de-France induced him to depend upon his own\r\nefforts. Before he left England in 1801, he had suggested that he might\r\nrequire assistance. In a letter to Willingham Franklin, John's brother, a\r\nfellow of Oriel College, Oxford, and afterwards a Judge in Madras, he\r\nwrote (November 27th, 1801):* (* Flinders' Papers.)\r\n\r\n\"You must understand that this voyage of ours is to be written and\r\npublished on our return. I am now engaged in writing a rough account, but\r\nauthorship sits awkwardly upon me. I am diffident of appearing before the\r\npublic unburnished by an abler hand. What say you? Will you give me your\r\nassistance if on my return a narration of our voyage should be called for\r\nfrom me? If the voyage be well executed and well told afterwards I shall\r\nhave some credit to spare to deserving friends. If the door now open\r\nsuits your taste and you will enter, it should be yours for the\r\nundertaking. A little mathematical knowledge will strengthen your style\r\nand give it perspicuity. Arrangement is the material point in\r\nvoyage-writing as well as in history. I feel great diffidence here.\r\nSufficient matter I can easily furnish, and fear not to prevent anything\r\nunseamanlike from entering into the composition; but to round a period\r\nwell and arrange sentences so as to place what is meant in the most\r\nperspicuous point of view is too much for me. Seamanship and authorship\r\nmake too great an angle with each other; the further a man advances upon\r\none line the further distant he becomes from any point on the other.\"\r\n\r\nIt did not prove so in Flinders' own case, for his later letters and the\r\nlatter part of his book are written in an easier, more freely-flowing\r\nstyle than marks his earlier writings. He solicited no assistance in the\r\nfinal preparation of his work. He preferred to speak to his public in his\r\nown voice, and was unquestionably well advised in so doing. It is a\r\nplain, honest sailor's story; that of a cultivated man withal.\r\n\r\nIntense application to the work in hand brought about a recurrence of the\r\nconstitutional internal trouble which had occasioned some pain in\r\nMauritius. The illness became acute at the end of 1813. He was only 39\r\nyears of age, but Mrs. Flinders wrote to a friend that he had aged so\r\nmuch that he looked 70, and was \"worn to a skeleton.\" He mentioned in his\r\njournal that he was suffering much pain. Yet he was never heard to\r\ncomplain, and was never irritable or troublesome to those about him. He\r\nwas full of kindness and concern for his friends. We find him attending\r\nsittings of the Admiralty Court, where his friend Pitot had a suit\r\nagainst the British Government, and he interested himself in the\r\npromotion of two of his old Investigator midshipmen. He urged upon the\r\nAdmiralty with all his force that his own branch of the naval service was\r\nas honourable and as deserving of official recognition as war service.\r\nThe only inducement for young officers to join a voyage of discovery, and\r\nforego the advantages arising from prizes and active service, was the\r\nreasonable certainty of promotion on their return. \"This,\" he observed,\r\n\"certainly has been relied upon and fulfilled in expeditions which\r\nreturned in time of peace, when promotion is so difficult to be obtained;\r\nwhereas I sailed and my officers returned during a war in which promotion\r\nwas never before so liberally bestowed. Yet no one of my officers, so far\r\nas I have been able to ascertain, has received promotion for their\r\nservices in that voyage, although it has been allowed the service was\r\nwell executed.\"* (* Flinders' Papers.)\r\n\r\nThe illness increased during 1814, while the \"Voyage\" and its\r\naccompanying atlas were passing through the press. He never saw the\r\nfinished book. The first copy of it came from the publishers, G. and W.\r\nNicol, of Pall Mall, on July 18th, on the day before he died; but he was\r\nthen unconscious. His wife took the volumes and laid them upon his bed,\r\nso that the hand that fashioned them could touch them. But he never\r\nunderstood. He was fast wrapped in the deep slumber that preceded the\r\nend. On the 19th he died. His devoted wife stood by his pillow, his\r\ninfant daughter (born April 1st, 1812) was in an adjoining room, and\r\nthere was one other friend present. Just before the brave life flickered\r\nout, he started up, and called in a hoarse voice for \"my papers.\" Then he\r\nfell back and died.\r\n\r\nUpon the manuscript of the friend who wrote an account of his death,\r\nthere is pencilled a brief memorandum, which chronicles a few words\r\nmuttered some time before death touched his lips. The pencil-writing is\r\nrubbed and only partly decipherable, but the letters \"Dr.\" are distinct.\r\nI take the meaning to be that the doctor attending him heard him murmur\r\nthe words. They are: \"But it grows late, boys, let us dismiss!\" One can\r\neasily realise the kind of picture that floated before the mind of the\r\ndying navigator. It was, surely, a happy vision of a night among friends\r\nand companions, who had listened with delight to the vivid talk of him\r\nwho had seen and done so much in his wonderful forty years of life. In\r\nsuch a company his mates would not be the first to wish to break the\r\nspell, so he gave the word: \"it grows late, boys, let us dismiss.\"\r\n\r\nFlinders died at 14 London Street, Fitzroy Square, and was buried in the\r\ngraveyard of St. James's, Hampstead Road, which was a burial ground for\r\nSt. James's, Piccadilly. No man now knows exactly where his bones were\r\nlaid.* (* The vicar of St. James's, Piccadilly, who examined the burial\r\nregister in response to an enquiry by Mr. George Gordon McCrae, of\r\nMelbourne, in 1912, states that the entry was made, by a clerical error,\r\nin the name of Captain Matthew Flanders, aged 40.) A letter written years\r\nlater by his daughter, Mrs. Petrie, says: \"Many years afterwards my aunt\r\nTyler went to look for his grave, but found the churchyard remodelled,\r\nand quantities of tombstones and graves with their contents had been\r\ncarted away as rubbish, among them that of my unfortunate father, thus\r\npursued by disaster after death as in life.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of the same month died Charles Dibdin, who wrote the elegy of\r\nthe perfect sailor:\r\n\r\n\"Here a sheer hulk lies poor Tom Bowling.\r\nThe darling of our crew,\r\nNo more he'll hear the tempest howling\r\nFor death has broached him to.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his last years in London, Flinders lodged in six houses\r\nsuccessively, and it may be as well to enumerate them. They were, 16 King\r\nStreet, Soho, from November 5th, 1810; 7 Nassau Street, Soho, from\r\nJanuary 19th, 1811; 7 Mary Street, Brook Street, from 30th September,\r\n1811; 45 Upper John Street, Fitzroy Square, from March 30th, 1813; 7\r\nUpper Fitzroy Street, from May 28th, 1813; and 14 London Street, Fitzroy\r\nSquare, from February 28th, 1814.\r\n\r\nA letter from the widow to her husband's French friend Pitot, evidently\r\nin answer to a message of sympathy, is poignant: \"You who were in a\r\nmeasure acquainted with the many virtues and inestimable qualities he\r\npossessed, will best appreciate the worth of the treasure I have lost,\r\nand you will easily imagine that, were the whole universe at my command,\r\nit could offer no compensation; and even the tenderest sympathy of the\r\ntruest friend avails but little in a case of such severe trial and\r\naffliction. You will not be surprised when I say that sorrow continually\r\ncircles round my heart and tears are my daily companion. 'Tis true the\r\ncompany of my little girl soothes and cheers many an hour that would\r\notherwise pass most wearily away, but life has lost its chief charm, and\r\nthe world appears a dreary wilderness to me.\r\n\r\nAn unpleasant feature of the subject, which cannot be overlooked, relates\r\nto the Admiralty's ungenerous treatment of Flinders and his widow. When\r\nhe returned from Mauritius, the First Lord was Mr. C.P. Yorke after whom\r\nFlinders named Yorke's Peninsula, who was inclined to recognise that the\r\nspecial circumstances of the case demanded special treatment. He at once\r\npromoted Flinders to the rank of Post-Captain. But in consequence of his\r\nlong detention Flinders had lost the opportunity for earlier promotion.\r\nIt was admitted that if he had returned to England in 1804 he would at\r\nonce have been rewarded for his services by promotion to post-captain's\r\nrank. Indeed, Lord Spencer had definitely promised him a step in rank. It\r\nwas therefore urged in his behalf that, as he had not been a prisoner of\r\nwar in the ordinary sense, his commission should be ante-dated to 1804.\r\nYorke appeared to think the claim reasonable. The Admiralty conceded that\r\nhe had not been a prisoner of war, and he was not brought before a\r\ncourt-martial, although the Cumberland, left to rot in Port Louis, had\r\nbeen lost to the service. The First Lord directed that the commission\r\nshould be ante-dated to the time of the release, but it was not\r\nconsidered that more could be done without an Order in Council. This\r\ncould not be obtained at the moment, because King George III was mentally\r\nincapacitated. When the Regency was established (1811) an application did\r\nnot meet with a sympathetic response. \"The hinge upon which my case\r\ndepends,\" said Flinders in a letter, \"is whether my having suffered so\r\nlong and unjustly in the Isle of France is a sufficient reason that I\r\nshould now suffer in England the loss of six years' rank.\" The response\r\nof the Admiralty officials was that the case was peculiar; there was \"no\r\nprecedent\" for ante-dating a promotion.\r\n\r\nFlinders asked that he might be put on full pay, while he was writing the\r\nVoyage, which would make up the difference in the expense to which he\r\nwould be put by living in town instead of in the country; but Barrow\r\nassured him that the Admiralty would object \"for want of a precedent.\" He\r\nshowed that he would be 500 or 600 pounds out of pocket, to say nothing\r\nof the loss of chances of promotion by remaining ashore. It was to meet\r\nthis position that the Admiralty granted him 200 pounds; but as a matter\r\nof fact he was still 300 pounds out of pocket,* and was put out of health\r\nirrecoverably by intense application to the task. (* Flinders' Papers.)\r\nHis friend, Captain Kent, then of the Agincourt, advised him to abandon\r\nthe work. \"I conjure you,\" he wrote \"to give the subject your serious\r\nattention, and do not suffer yourself to be involved in debt to gratify\r\npersons who seem to have no feeling.\" But to have abandoned his beloved\r\nwork at this stage would have appeared worse to him than loss of life\r\nitself. The consequence was that his expenses during this period, even\r\nwith the strictly economical mode of living which he adopted, entrenched\r\nupon the small savings which he was able to leave to his widow. He was\r\ncompelled to represent that, unless a concession were made, he would have\r\nto choose between abandoning his task or reducing his family to distress;\r\nand it was for this reason that the Admiralty granted a special allowance\r\nof 200 pounds, in supplement of his half-pay. This, with 500 pounds \"in\r\nlieu of compensation\" on account of his detention in Ile-de-France was\r\nthe entire consideration that he received.\r\n\r\nWhen he died, application was made to the Admiralty to grant a special\r\npension to Mrs. Flinders. The widow of Captain Cook had been granted a\r\npension of 200 pounds a year. (Mrs. Cook, by the way, was still living in\r\nEngland at this time; she did not die till 1835). Stout old Sir Joseph\r\nBanks declared that he would not die happy unless something were done for\r\nthe widow and child of Matthew Flinders. But his influence with the\r\nAdmiralty was not so great as it had been in Lord Spencer's time, and his\r\nefforts were ineffectual. The case was at a later date brought under the\r\nnotice of William IV, who said that he saw no reason why the widow of\r\nCaptain Flinders should not receive the same treatment as the widow of\r\nCaptain Cook. The King mentioned the subject to Lord Melbourne; he,\r\nhowever, was unsympathetic, and nothing whatever was done. Mrs. Flinders\r\nwas paid only the meagre pension of a post-captain's widow until she died\r\nin 1852. No official reward of any kind was granted by the British\r\nGovernment for the truly great services and discoveries of Flinders. The\r\nstinginess of a rich nation is a depressing subject to reflect upon in a\r\ncase of this kind.\r\n\r\nA gratifying contrast is afforded by the voluntary action of two\r\nAustralian colonies. It was learnt, to the surprise of many, some time\r\nafter 1850, that the widow of the discoverer and her married daughter\r\nwere living in England, and were not too well provided for. The Colonies\r\nof New South Wales and Victoria thereupon (1853) voted a pension of 100\r\npounds a year each to Mrs. Flinders, with reversion to Mrs. Petrie. The\r\nnews of this decision did not reach England in time to please the aged\r\nwidow, but the spirit of the grant gave unfeigned satisfaction to\r\nFlinders' daughter. \"Could my beloved mother have lived to receive this\r\nannouncement,\" she wrote,* (* New South Wales Parliamentary Papers 1854 1\r\n785.) \"it would indeed have cheered her last days to know that my\r\nfather's long-neglected services were at length appreciated. But my\r\ngratification arising from the grant is extreme, especially as it comes\r\nfrom a quarter in which I had not solicited consideration; and the\r\nhandsome amount of the pension granted will enable me to educate my young\r\nson in a manner worthy of the name he bears, Matthew Flinders.\"* (* \"My\r\nyoung son\" is the present Professor W. Matthew Flinders Petrie.)\r\n\r\nThe Voyage to Terra Australis, it may be mentioned, was originally sold\r\nfor 8 or 12 guineas, according to whether or not the atlas was bought\r\nwith the two quarto volumes. A copy to-day, with the folio Atlas, sells\r\nfor about 10 guineas.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 28. CHARACTERISTICS.\r\n\r\nMatthew Flinders was a short, neatly-built, very lithe and active man. He\r\nstood five feet six inches in height.* (* These particulars are from the\r\nmanuscript sketch by a friend, previously cited; Flinders' Papers.) His\r\nfigure was slight and well proportioned. When he was in full health, his\r\nlight, buoyant step was remarked upon by acquaintances. Neither of the\r\ntwo portraits of him conveys a good impression of his alert, commanding\r\nlook. His nose was \"rather aquiline,\" and his lips were customarily\r\ncompressed. \"He had a noble brow, hair almost black, eyes dark, bright,\r\nand with a commanding expression, amounting almost to sternness.\" So his\r\nfriend records.\r\n\r\nMrs. Flinders was not satisfied with the engraved portrait published in\r\nthe Naval Chronicle, 1814, nor with the miniature from which it was\r\nreproduced. In a letter to Captain Stuart she wrote: \"In the portrait you\r\nwill not be able to trace much of your departed friend. The miniature\r\nfrom which it was taken is but an indifferent likeness, and the engraver\r\nhas not done justice to it. He has given the firmness of the countenance\r\nbut not the intelligence or animation.\" It is quite certain that a rapid,\r\npiercing, commanding expression of eye and features was characteristic of\r\nhim. During his captivity, the look in his eyes forbad all approach to\r\nfamiliarity. There is record of an occasion--in all probability connected\r\nwith the sword incident--when he was addressed in terms that appeared to\r\nhim to be wanting in respect; and the unlucky Frenchman who ventured thus\r\nfar was so astonished at the sternness of countenance that immediately\r\nconfronted him, that he started back some paces. He had been accustomed\r\nto command from an early age, and had exercised authority on service of a\r\nkind that compelled him to demand ceaseless vigilance and indefatigable\r\nvigour from himself and those under him. In a passage written in\r\nMauritius* (* Flinders' Papers.) he makes allusion to the stern element\r\nin his character; and surely what he says here is worthy of being well\r\npondered by all whose duty demands the exercise of power over other men:\r\n\r\n\"I shall learn patience in this island, which will perhaps counteract the\r\ninsolence acquired by having had unlimited command over my fellow men.\r\nYou know, my dearest, that I always dreaded the effect that the\r\npossession of great authority would have upon my temper and disposition.\r\nI hope they are neither of them naturally bad; but, when we see such a\r\nvast difference between men dependent and men in power, any man who has\r\nany share of impartiality must fear for himself. My brother will tell you\r\nthat I am proud, unindulgent, and hasty to take offence, but I doubt\r\nwhether John Franklin will confirm it, although there is more truth in\r\nthe charge than I wish there were. In this land, those malignant\r\nqualities are ostentatiously displayed. I am made to feel their sting\r\nmost poignantly. My mind has been taught a lesson in philosophy, and my\r\njudgment has gained an accession of experience that will not soon be\r\nforgotten.\"\r\n\r\nThat is a fairly rigorous piece of self-analysis; but there are abundant\r\nfacts to show that he exercised authority with a kindly and friendly\r\ndisposition, and did not surpass the limits of wisdom. Men like a\r\ncommander who can command; the weak inspire no confidence. Flinders had\r\nthe art of attracting people to him. His servant, the faithful John\r\nElder, willingly endured imprisonment with him, and would not leave him\r\nuntil his own health gave way. John Thistle, who had served under him\r\nbefore 1800, returned to England shortly before the Investigator sailed,\r\nand at once volunteered for service under him again. He ruled his crews\r\nby sheer force of mind and unsparing example, and though the good of the\r\nservice in hand was ever his first thought, there is plenty of evidence\r\nto prove that the happiness of the men under him was constantly in his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nIn hours of relaxation he was genial, a lively companion, a warm friend.\r\nAn intimate friend records: \"He possessed the social virtues and\r\naffections in an eminent degree, and in conversation he was particularly\r\nagreeable, from the extent of his general information and the lively\r\nacuteness of his observations. His integrity, uprightness of intention,\r\nand liberality of sentiment were not to be surpassed.\"\r\n\r\nA scrap of dialogue written for insertion in the Voyage to Terra\r\nAustralis, but cancelled with other matter, enables us to realise that he\r\ncould recall an incident with some dramatic force. Bonnefoy, an\r\ninterpreter in Ile-de-France, told him a story of an American skipper\r\nunder examination by one of General Decaen's officers, and he wrote it\r\ndown as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"I was amused with his account of a blunt American captain who, having\r\nleft a part of his people to collect seal-skins upon the island Tristan\r\nd'Acuna, had come in for provisions, and to get his vessel repaired. This\r\nhonest man did not wish to tell where he was collecting his cargo, nor\r\ndid he understand all the ceremony he was required to go through. The\r\ndialogue that passed between the old seaman and the French officers of\r\nthe port was nearly thus:\r\n\r\nOff.: From whence do you come, Sir?\r\n\r\nFrom whence do I come? Haugh! why, Monsieur, I come from the Atlantic\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\nOff.: But, pray, Sir, from what port?\r\n\r\nPort? You will find that out from my papers, which I suppose you want to\r\nsee?\r\n\r\nOff.: It appears, Sir, that you have not above half your crew on board.\r\nBe so good as to inform me where are the rest?\r\n\r\nO, my crew? Poor fellows, yes, why, Sir, we met with an island of ice on\r\nthe road, and I left them there a-basket-making.\r\n\r\nOff.: Making baskets on an island of ice? This is a very strange answer,\r\nSir; and give me leave to tell you such will not do here; but you will\r\naccompany me to the Captain-General, and we shall then see whether you\r\nwill answer or not.\r\n\r\nAy, we shall see indeed. Why, look ye, Monsieur: as to what I have been\r\nabout, that is nothing to anybody. I am an honest man, and that's enough\r\nfor you; but if you want to know why I am come here, it is to buy\r\nprovisions and to lie quiet a little bit. I am not come to beg or steal,\r\nbut to buy, and I fancy good bills upon M--- of Salem will suit you very\r\nwell, eh, Monsieur? Convenient enough?\r\n\r\nOff.: Very well, Sir, you will come with us to the General.\r\n\r\nTo the General? I have nothing to do with Generals! They don't understand\r\nmy business. Suppose I don't go?\r\n\r\nOff.: You will do as you please, Sir; but if you do not, you will\r\nsoon...\"\r\n\r\nThe sheet on which the continuation of this vigorous bit of dialogue was\r\nwritten* is unfortunately missing, so that we are deprived of the joy of\r\nreading the conclusion of the comedy. But as the passage stands it\r\npresents a truly dramatic picture. (* Manuscript, Mitchell Library.)\r\n\r\nWe get a glimpse of the way in which genial spirits regarded him in a\r\njolly letter from Madras, from Lieutenant Fitzwilliam Owen, who had been\r\na prisoner with him in Mauritius, and was on the cartel on which he\r\nsailed from that island. \"You cannot doubt how much our society misses\r\nyou. We toasted you, Sir, like Englishmen. We sent the heartiest good\r\nwishes of your countrymen, ay, and women too, to Heaven for your success,\r\nin three times three loud and manly cheers, dictated by that sincerity\r\nwhich forms the glorious characteristic of our rough-spun English. Nay,\r\nWaugh got drunk for you, and the ladies did each take an extra glass to\r\nyou.\"* (* Flinders' Papers.)\r\n\r\nA pleasant playful touch makes the following letter to his wife's\r\nhalf-sister worth quoting. He was hungry for home letters in\r\nIle-de-France, and thus gently chid the girl: \"There is indeed a report\r\namong the whales in the Indian Ocean that a scrap of a letter from you\r\ndid pass by for Port Jackson, and a flying fish in the Pacific even says\r\nhe saw it; but there is no believing these travellers. If you will take\r\nthe trouble to give it under your own hand I will then believe that you\r\nhave written to me. A certain philosopher being informed that his dear\r\nfriend was dead, replied that he would not believe it without having it\r\ncertified under his own hand; a very commendable prudence this, and\r\nworthy of imitation in all intricate cases. As I have a fund of justice\r\nat the bottom of my conscience, which will not permit me to exact from\r\nothers more than I would perform myself, I do hereby certify that I have\r\nthis day addressed a letter to my well-beloved sister Isabella Tyler,\r\nspinster, in which letter I do desire for her all manner of blessings,\r\nspiritual and temporal; that she may speedily obtain a husband six feet\r\nhigh, if it so pleases her, with the wishing cap of Fortunatus.\"\r\n\r\nThe strictness of the man's conduct, in his relations with superiors and\r\nsubordinates alike, sprang from his integrity of heart. Everybody trusted\r\nhim. A memoir published by a contemporary commented upon the fidelity of\r\nhis friendships. \"He was faithful to the utmost in the performance of a\r\npromise, whether important or trifling in its consequences.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the best friends he ever made were among the French in\r\nIle-de-France; and he became so much attached to them that, even when he\r\nsecured his longed-for freedom, he could not part from them without a\r\npang of regret. They saw in him not only a wronged man, but a singularly\r\nhigh-minded one. Pitot, writing to Bougainville to urge him to do his\r\nutmost to secure Flinders' release, repudiated, in these terms, the idea\r\nthat he could be a spy:* \"No, Monsieur Flinders is not capable of such\r\nconduct; his pure and noble character would never permit him to descend\r\nto the odious employment of a spy.\" (* Manuscripts, Mitchell Library;\r\nletter dated 19 Vendemiaire, an 13. October 11, 1804.) One wonders\r\nwhether by any chance Bougainville had occasion to show that letter to\r\nMessieurs Peron and Freycinet!\r\n\r\nA touching and beautiful example of his gentleness occurred in connection\r\nwith a wounded French officer whom he visited at Port Louis. Lieutenant\r\nCharles Baudin des Ardennes had sailed as a junior officer on Le\r\nGeographe under Baudin (to whom he was not related) and Flinders had\r\nknown him at Port Jackson. In 1807 he was serving as a lieutenant on La\r\nSemillante, in the Indian Ocean. He was badly wounded in a sharp\r\nengagement with the British ship Terpsichore in March, 1807, and was\r\nbrought into Port Louis, where his shattered right arm was amputated.\r\nFlinders, full of compassion for the young man, visited him, and, as\r\noranges were required for the sufferer, bought up the whole stock of a\r\nfruiterer, 53 of them. Upon his return to Wilhelm's Plains, he wrote\r\nBaudin a letter of sympathy and encouragement, bidding him reflect that\r\nthere were other branches of useful service open to a sailor than that of\r\nwarfare. He had commenced his naval career with discovery; he now knew\r\nwhat the horrors of war were. Which was the worthier branch of the two?\r\nFlinders continued: \"No, my friend, I cannot contemplate this waste of\r\nhuman life to serve the cause of restless ambition without horror. Never\r\nshall my hands be voluntarily steeped in blood, but in the defence of my\r\ncountry. In such a cause every other sentiment vanishes. Also, my friend,\r\nif ever you have thought my actions worthy of being imitated, imitate me\r\nin this. You have, like me, had just sufficient experience to learn what\r\nthe commander of a voyage of discovery ought to be, and what he ought to\r\nknow. Adieu, my dear friend. May the goodness of God speedily restore you\r\nto perfect health, and turn your thoughts from war to peace.\" Young\r\nBaudin, it may be added, was not compelled by the loss of his arm to\r\nleave the service. He became an Admiral in 1839, and lived till 1854.\r\n\r\nFlinders endeavoured to exert a stimulating influence upon young\r\nofficers. Writing to his brother (December 6th, 1806) he said:* \"Remember\r\nthat youth is the time in which a store of knowledge, reputation and\r\nfortune must be laid in to make age respectable. Imitate, my dear Samuel,\r\nall that you have found commendable in my proceedings, manners, and\r\nprinciples, and avoid the rest. Study is necessary, as it gives theory. I\r\nneed not speak to you now upon this, but active exertion is still more\r\nnecessary to a good sea officer. From both united it is that perfection\r\nis attained. Neither would I have you neglect politeness, and the best\r\nsociety to which circumstances may permit your admission; though not the\r\nbasis that constitutes a good officer or valuable member of society, the\r\nmanners thereby acquired are yet of infinite service to those who possess\r\nthem.\" (* Mr. Charles Bertie, of the Municipal Library, Sydney, has\r\nkindly supplied me with this letter, which was obtained from Professor\r\nFlinders Petrie.)\r\n\r\nThere could hardly be a sounder piece of advice to a young officer from\r\nan elder than is contained in a letter written by Flinders to John\r\nFranklin's father. It was intended for the youth's eye, beyond a doubt.\r\nIt is dated May 10th, 1805:* (* Manuscripts, Mitchell Library.) \"I hope\r\nJohn will have got into some active ship to get his time completed before\r\nI go out another voyage, and learn the discipline of the service. I have\r\nno doubt of being able to get him a lieutenant's commission if it should\r\nbe agreeable to him to sail with me again. He may rest confident of my\r\nfriendship, although I believe he had some fears on that head when we\r\nparted, on account of a difference between him and my brother. He has\r\nability enough, but he must be diligent, studious, active in his duty,\r\nnot over-ready to take offence at his superior officers, nor yet humbling\r\ntoo much to them; but in all things should make allowances for difference\r\nof disposition and ways of thinking and should judge principally from the\r\nintention. Above all things he should be strict in his honour and\r\nintegrity, for a man who forfeits either cannot be independent or brave\r\nat all times; and he should not be afraid to be singular, for, if he is,\r\nthe ridicule of the vicious would beat him out of his rectitude as well\r\nas out of his attention to his duty. I do not speak this from my fear of\r\nhim, but from my anxiety to see him the shining character which I am sure\r\nhe is capable of being.\"\r\n\r\nIn a similar strain is a letter to John Franklin (January 14th, 1812)\r\nregarding a lad named Wiles, the son of a Jamaica friend, who had lately\r\nbeen put on the Bedford as a midshipman: \"I will thank you to let me know\r\nfrom time to time how he goes on. Pray don't let him be idle. Employ him\r\nin learning to knot and splice under a quartermaster; in working under\r\nobservation, in writing his journal, and in such studies as may be useful\r\nto him. Make it a point of honour with him to be quick in relieving the\r\ndeck, and strict in keeping his watch; and when there are any courts\r\nmartial endeavour either to take him with you or that he may attend when\r\nit can be done. In fine, my dear John, endeavour to make a good officer\r\nand a good man of him, and be sure I shall always entertain a grateful\r\nsense of your attention to him.\"\r\n\r\nActive-minded himself, he encouraged study among those who came in\r\ncontact with him. It gave him pleasure to teach mathematics to Madame\r\nD'Arifat's sons at Wilhelm's Plains. He mastered French so as to speak it\r\nwith grace and write with ease. He worked at Malay because he thought it\r\nwould be useful on future voyages. From the early days, when he taught\r\nhimself navigation amidst the swamps of his native Lincolnshire, until\r\nhis last illness laid him low, he was ever an eager student. Intelligent\r\ncuriosity and a desire to know the best that the best minds could teach\r\nwere a basic part of his character. We find him counselling Ann Chappell,\r\nat about the time when he became engaged to her:* (* Flinders' Papers.)\r\n\"Learn music, learn the French language, enlarge the subjects of thy\r\npencil, study geography and astronomy and even metaphysics, sooner than\r\nleave thy mind unoccupied. Soar, my Annette, aspire to the heights of\r\nscience. Write a great deal, work with thy needle a great deal, and read\r\nevery book that comes in thy way, save trifling novels.\"\r\n\r\nFlinders read widely, and always carried a good library with him on his\r\nvoyages. His acquaintance with the literature of navigation was very\r\nextensive. Some of his books were lost in the Porpoise wreck; the\r\nremainder he took with him in the Cumberland, and, when he was\r\nimprisoned, his anxiety to secure his printed volumes manifested the true\r\nbook-lover's hunger to have near him those companions of his intellectual\r\nlife. He derived great pleasure from the French literature which he\r\nstudied in Mauritius. A letter to his wife dated March, 1803, when he was\r\nupon the north coast of Australia in the Investigator, reveals him\r\nrelieving his mind, amid anxieties about the condition of the ship, by\r\nreading Milton's Paradise Lost. \"The elevation and, also, the fall of our\r\nfirst parents,\" he comments, \"told with such majesty by him whose eyes\r\nlacked all of what he threw so masterly o'er the great subject, dark\r\nbefore and intricate--these with delight I perused, not knowing which to\r\nadmire most, the poet's daring, the subject, or the success with which\r\nhis bold attempt was crowned.\" He somewhat quaintly compares his wife\r\nwith Eve: \"But in thee I have more faith than Adam had when he, complying\r\nwith Eve's request of separation in their labours, said 'Go, thou best,\r\nlast gift of God, go in thy native innocence.' But how much dearer art\r\nthou here than our first mother! Our separation was not sought by thee,\r\nbut thou borest it as a vine whose twining arms when turned from round\r\nthe limb lie prostrate, broken, life scarcely left enough to keep the\r\nwithered leaf from falling off.\" We should especially have welcomed notes\r\nfrom such a pen on a few passages in Milton which must have stirred his\r\ndeepest interest, as for example the majestic comparison of Satan's\r\nflight:\r\n\r\n\"As when far off at sea a fleet descried\r\nHangs in the clouds, by equinoctial winds\r\nClose sailing from Bengala, or the isles\r\nOf Ternate or Tidore, whence merchants bring\r\nTheir spicy drugs; they on the trading flood,\r\nThrough the wide Ethiopian to the Cape,\r\nPly stemming nightly towards the pole: so seemed\r\nFar off the flying Fiend.\"\r\n\r\nTo these characteristics may be added a passage illustrating the view of\r\nour navigator concerning the marriage state. It must be confessed that\r\nwhen he wrote it (June 30th, 1807) his experience was not extensive. He\r\nleft England when he had been a husband only a few weeks; but the passage\r\nis interesting as conveying to his wife what his conception of the ideal\r\nrelation was: \"There is a medium between petticoat government and tyranny\r\non the part of the husband, that with thee I think to be very attainable;\r\nand which I consider to be the summit of happiness in the marriage state.\r\nThou wilt be to me not only a beloved wife, but my most dear and most\r\nintimate friend, as I hope to be to thee. If we find failings, we will\r\nlook upon them with kindness and compassion, and in each other's merits\r\nwe will take pride, and delight to dwell upon them; thus we will realise,\r\nas far as may be, the happiness of heaven upon the earth. I love not\r\ngreatness nor desire great riches, being confident they do not contribute\r\nto happiness, but I desire to have enough for ourselves and something to\r\nassist our friends in need. I think, my love, this is also thy way of\r\nthinking.\"\r\n\r\nIn the few concluding months of her husband's life, Mrs. Flinders had him\r\nbeside her under circumstances that were certainly far from easy. Their\r\nsomewhat straitened means, consequent upon the Admiralty's niggard\r\nconstruction of regulations, the prolonged severity of his employment,\r\nand the last agonised weeks of illness, must have gone far to detract\r\nfrom perfect felicity in domestic conditions. The six changes of\r\nresidence in four and a half years point to the same conclusion.\r\nNevertheless we find Mrs. Flinders writing to a friend in these terms,\r\nwherein her own happiness is clearly mirrored: \"I am well persuaded that\r\nvery few men know how to value the regard and tender attentions of a wife\r\nwho loves them. Men in general cannot appreciate properly the delicate\r\naffection of a woman, and therefore they do not know how to return it. To\r\nmake the married life as happy as this world will allow it to be, there\r\nare a thousand little amenities to be rendered on both sides, and as many\r\nlittle shades of comfort to be attended to. Many things must be\r\noverlooked, for we are all such imperfect beings; and to bear and forbear\r\nis essential to domestic peace. You will say that I find it easy to talk\r\non this subject, and that precept is harder than practice. I allow it, my\r\ndear friend, in the practical part I have only to return kind affection\r\nand attention for uniform tenderness and regard. I have nothing\r\nunpleasant to call forth my forbearance. Day after day, month after month\r\npasses, and I neither experience an angry look nor a dissatisfied word.\r\nOur domestic life is an unvaried line of peace and comfort; and O, may\r\nHeaven continue it such, so long as it shall permit us to dwell together\r\non this earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 29. THE NAVIGATOR.\r\n\r\nNot only is Flinders to be regarded as a discoverer whose researches\r\ncompleted the world's knowledge of the last extensive region of the\r\nhabitable globe remaining in his time to be revealed; not only as one\r\nwhose work was marked by an unrivalled exactitude and fineness of\r\nobservation; but also as one who did very much to advance the science of\r\nnavigation in directions calculated to make seafaring safer, more\r\ncertain, with better means and methods at disposal. Malte-Brun declared,\r\nwhen he died, that \"the geographical and nautical sciences have lost in\r\nthe person of Flinders one of their most brilliant ornaments,\"* and that\r\ncriticism, coming from a foreign critic than whom there was no better\r\ninformed savant in Europe, was no mere piece of obituary rhetoric. (*\r\nAnnales des Voyages 23 268.)\r\n\r\nIn 1805 he wrote a paper on the Marine Barometer, based upon observations\r\nmade during his Australian voyages. The instrument employed was one which\r\nhad been used by Cook; Flinders always kept it in his cabin. He was the\r\nfirst to discover, and this essay was the first attempt to show, the\r\nconnection between the rise and fall of the barometer and the direction\r\nof the wind. Careful observation showed him that where his facts were\r\ncollected the mercury of the barometer rose some time before a change\r\nfrom landbreeze to seabreeze, and fell before the change from seabreeze\r\nto landbreeze. Consequently a change of wind might generally be predicted\r\nfrom the barometer. The importance of these observations was at once\r\nrecognised by men connected with navigation. As the Edinburgh Review\r\nwrote, dealing with Flinders' paper when presented before the Royal\r\nSociety on March 27th, 1806:* \"It is very easy for us, speculating in our\r\ncloset upon the theory of winds and their connection with the\r\ntemperature, to talk of drawing a general inference on this subject with\r\nconfidence. But when the philosopher chances to be a seaman on a very\r\ndangerous coast, it will be admitted that the strength of this confidence\r\nis put to a test somewhat more severe; and we find nevertheless that\r\nCaptain Flinders staked the safety of his ship and the existence of\r\nhimself and his crew on the truth of the above proposition.\" (* Edinburgh\r\nReview, January, 1807; Flinders' Paper, \"Observations on the Marine\r\nBarometer,\" was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal\r\nSociety, Part 2 1806.) Nowadays, indeed, the principal use of a barometer\r\nto a navigator aboard ship is to enable him to anticipate changes of\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nNot less important were his experiments and writings upon variations of\r\nthe compass aboard ship. The fact that the needle of a compass showed\r\ndeviations on being moved from one part of a ship to another had been\r\nobserved by navigators in the eighteenth century, but Flinders was the\r\nfirst to experiment systematically to ascertain the cause and to invent a\r\nremedy.* (* For the history of the matter see Alexander Smith's\r\nIntroduction to W. Scoresby's Journal of a Voyage to Australia for\r\nMagnetic Research, 1859.)\r\n\r\nHe observed not only that the direction of the needle varied according to\r\nthe part of the ship where it was placed, but also that a change in the\r\ndirection of the ship's head made a difference. Further, he found that in\r\nnorthern latitudes (in the English Channel, for instance) the north end\r\nof the needle was attracted towards the bow of the ship; whilst in\r\nsouthern latitudes, in Bass Strait, there was an attraction towards the\r\nstern; and at the equator there was no deviation. He came to the\r\nconclusion that these results were due to the presence of iron in the\r\nship. When he returned to England in 1810, he wrote a memorandum on the\r\nsubject to the Admiralty, and requested that experiments might be made\r\nupon ships of the Navy, with the object of verifying a law which he had\r\ndeduced from a long series of observations. His conclusion was that \"the\r\nmagnetism of the earth and the attraction forward in the ship must act\r\nupon the needle in the nature of a compound force, and that errors\r\nproduced by the attraction should be proportionate to the sines of the\r\nangles between the ship's head and the magnetic meridian.\" Experiments\r\nwere made at Sheerness, Portsmouth, and Plymouth on five vessels. He took\r\na keen personal interest in them; and the result was his invention of the\r\nFlinders' bar, which is now used in every properly equipped ship in the\r\nworld. The purpose of the bar, which is a vertical rod of soft iron,\r\nplaced so that its upper end is level with or slightly above the compass\r\nneedle, is to compensate for the effect of the vertical soft iron in the\r\nship.* (* See the excellent chapter on \"Compasses\" in Volume 2 of the\r\nBritish Admiralty's Manual of Seamanship.) Flinders' work upon this\r\ntechnical subject was important even in the days of wooden ships. In this\r\nera of iron and steel ships it is regarded by every sailor as of the\r\nutmost value.\r\n\r\nIn Flinders' day the delicacy of the compass, its liability to error, the\r\nnature of the magnetic force to which it responds, and the necessity for\r\ncare in its handling, were very little appreciated. \"Among the nautical\r\ninstruments taken to sea there are not any so ill-constructed, nor of\r\nwhich so little care is taken afterwards, as the compass,\" he did not\r\nhesitate to write.* (* Manuscript, \"Chapter in the History of Magnetism;\"\r\nFlinders' Papers; another copy was sent to the Admiralty.) Compasses were\r\nsupplied to the Admiralty by contract, and were not inspected. They were\r\nstowed in storehouses without any regard to the attraction to which the\r\nneedles might be exposed. They might be kept in store for a few years;\r\nand they were then sent on board ships without any re-touching, \"for no\r\nmagnets were kept in the dockyards, and probably no person there ever saw\r\nthem used.\" When a compass was sent aboard a ship of the Navy, it was\r\ndelivered into the charge of the boatswain and put into his store or\r\nsail-room. Perhaps it was put on a shelf with his knives and forks and a\r\nfew marline-spikes. Flinders urged that spare compasses should be\r\npreserved carefully in officers' cabins. Magnets for re-touching were not\r\nkept in one ship in a hundred. Under these circumstances, he asked, \"can\r\nit be a subject of surprise that the most experienced navigators are\r\nthose who put the least confidence in the compass, or that ships running\r\nthree or four days without an observation should be found in situations\r\nvery different from what was expected, and some of them lost? The\r\ncurrents are easily blamed, and sometimes with reason. Ships coming home\r\nfrom the Baltic and finding themselves upon the shores of the Dutch\r\ncoast, when they were thought to be on the English side, lay it to the\r\ncurrents; but the same currents, as I am informed, do not prevail when\r\nsteering in the opposite direction.\" The last is a neat stroke of irony.\r\nFlinders strongly recommended that the Admiralty should appoint an\r\ninspector of compasses, that there should be at every dockyard an officer\r\nfor re-touching compasses, and that a magnet for re-touching should be\r\ncarried on each flagship. The recommendations may seem like a counsel of\r\nelementary precautions to-day, but they involved an important reform of\r\nmethod in 1810.\r\n\r\nFlinders also wrote on the theory of the tides; a set of notes on the\r\nmagnetism of the earth exists in manuscript; a manuscript of 106 pages,\r\nconsisting of a treatise on spheric trigonometry, is illustrated by\r\nbeautifully drawn diagrams, and includes an account of eight practical\r\nmethods of calculating latitude and five of calculating longitude. In\r\nMauritius he read all he could obtain about the history of the island,\r\nand wrote a set of notes on Grant's History.\r\n\r\nHe was eager to praise the work of previous navigators. Laperouse was\r\nespecially a hero of his, and he wrote in French for the Societe\r\nd'Emulation of Ile-de-France an account of the probable fate of that\r\ncelebrated sailor. In an eloquent passage in this essay, speaking of the\r\nwreck, he cried: \"O, Laperouse, my heart speaks to me of the agony that\r\nrent yours. Ah, your eyes beheld the hapless companions of your dangers\r\nand your glory fall one after another exhausted into the sea. Ah, your\r\neyes saw the fruit of vast and useful labours lost to the world. I think\r\nof your sorrowing family. The picture is too painful for me to dwell upon\r\nit; but at least when all human hope abandoned you, then--the last\r\nblessing that God gives to the good--a ray of consolation shone upon your\r\neyes, and showed you that beyond those furious waves which broke upon\r\nyour vessels and swept away from you your companions another refuge was\r\nopened to your virtues by the angel of pity.\"\r\n\r\nKnowing the extreme difficulties attaching to navigation, even when in\r\nthe public interest he had to make a correction in the work of others, he\r\nwas anxious to cause no irritation. He sent to the editor of the Naval\r\nChronicle a correction in Horsburgh's Directions for Sailing to and from\r\nthe East Indies, but requested the editor to submit it first to the\r\nauthor of that work, and to suppress publication if Horsburg so desired.\r\nHe never expressed a tinge of regret that he had chosen a field of\r\nprofessional employment wherein promotion and reward were not liberally\r\nbestowed. Entering the Navy under influential auspices, in a period when\r\nactive service provided plentiful scope for advancement, he deliberately\r\npreferred the explorer's hard lot. The only prize money he ever won was\r\n10 pounds after Lord Howe's victory in 1794. \"I chose a branch,\" he said\r\nin a letter to Banks, \"which though less rewarded by rank and fortune is\r\nyet little less in celebrity. If adverse fortune does not oppose me, I\r\nwill succeed.\" He succeeded beyond all he could have hoped.\r\n\r\nThe excellence of his charts was such that to this day the Admiralty\r\ncharts for those portions of the Australian coast where he did original\r\nwork bear upon them the honoured name of Matthew Flinders; and amongst\r\nthe seamen who habitually traverse these coasts, no name, not even that\r\nof Cook, is so deeply esteemed as his. Flinders is not a tradition; the\r\nnavigators of our own time count him a companion of the watch.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 30. THE NAMING OF AUSTRALIA.\r\n\r\nThe name Australia was given to the great southern continent by Flinders.\r\nWhen and why he gave it that name will now be shown.\r\n\r\nIn the first place a common error must be set right. It is sometimes said\r\nthat the Spanish navigator, Pedro Fernandez de Quiros, named one of the\r\nislands of the New Hebrides group, in 1606, Australia del Espiritu Santo.\r\nThis is not the case. The narrative of his voyage described \"all this\r\nregion of the south as far as the Pole which from this time shall be\r\ncalled Austrialia del Espiritu Santo,\" from \"His Majesty's title of\r\nAustria.\" The word Austrialia is a punning name. Quiros' sovereign,\r\nPhilip III, was a Habsburg; and Quiros, in compliment to him, devised the\r\nname Austrialia as combining the meaning \"Austrian land,\" as well as\r\n\"southern land.\"* (* See Markham, Voyages of Quiros, Hakluyt Society\r\nVolume 1 page 30.)\r\n\r\nIn 1756 the word \"Australasia\" was coined. Charles de Brosses, in his\r\nHistoire des Navigations aux Terres Australes, wanted a word to signify a\r\nnew division of the globe. The maps marked off Europe, Asia, Africa and\r\nAmerica, but the vast region to the south of Asia required a name\r\nlikewise. De Brosses simply added \"Austral\" to \"Asia,\" and printed\r\n\"Australasia\" upon his map.\r\n\r\nThe earliest use of the word Australia that I have been able to find,\r\noccurs in the index to the Dutch Generale Beschrijvinge van Indien\r\n(General Description of the Indies) published at Batavia in 1638. The\r\nwork consists mainly of accounts of voyages by Dutch vessels to the East\r\nIndies. Among them is a history of the \"Australische Navigatien\" of Jacob\r\nle Maire and Willem Cornelisz Schouten, made in 1615 to 1617. They sailed\r\nthrough the Straits of Magellan, crossed the Pacific, touched at the\r\nSolomon Islands, and thence made their way round by the north of New\r\nGuinea to Java. The word Australia does not occur anywhere in the\r\nblack-letter text of the narrative, and the word Australische in the\r\nphrase \"Australische Navigatien,\" simply means southern. There are\r\nreferences in the book to \"Terra Australis,\" but Le Maire and Schouten\r\nknew not Australia. Nor does the narrative make any allusion to the\r\ncontinent which we know by that name. The Terra Australis of these Dutch\r\nnavigators was land of the southern hemisphere in general. But,\r\ncuriously, the indexer of the Generale Beschrijvinge made four entries,\r\nin which he employed the word Australia. Thus, his entry \"Australia\r\nIncognita Ondeckt\" (Australia Incognita Discovered) referred to passages\r\nin Le Maire and Schouten's voyage relating to the southern lands they had\r\nseen. But it did not refer to the Australia of modern geography. It is\r\nvery strange that the Dutch indexer in Batavia should have hit upon the\r\nword and employed it when he did not find it in the text of the book\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe use of Australia in an English book of 1693 is also extremely\r\ncurious. In 1676 Gabriel de Foigny, under the assumed name of Jacques\r\nSadeur, published at Vannes a quaint little duodecimo volume, purporting\r\nto give a description of an unknown southern land. He called his book La\r\nTerre Australe connue; c'est a dire, la description de ce pays inconnu\r\njusqu'ici. It was a \"voyage imaginaire,\" a pure piece of fancy. In 1693\r\nit was translated into English, and published in London, by John Dunton,\r\nunder the title A New Discovery of Terra Incognita, or the Southern\r\nWorld, by James Sadeur, a Frenchman, who being cast there by a shipwreck,\r\nlived 35 years in that country and gives a particular description of the\r\nmanners, customs, religion, laws, studies and wars of those southern\r\npeople, and of some animals peculiar to that place; with several other\r\nrarities. In the original French the word Australia does not occur. But\r\nin the English translation Foigny's phrase \"continent de la Terre\r\nAustrale,\" is rendered \"Australia.\" Foigny's ingenious piece of fiction\r\ndrew its \"local colour\" from the South American region, not from any\r\nsupposed land in the neighbourhood of the Australian continent. The\r\ninstance is all the more interesting from the possibility that the book\r\nmay have given a hint to Swift in the writing of Gulliver's Travels.* (*\r\nSee the Cambridge History of English Literature 9 106; where, however,\r\nthe English translation is erroneously cited as Journey of Jacques Sadour\r\nto Australia.)\r\n\r\nIn 1770 and 1771 Alexander Dalrymple published An Historical Collection\r\nof Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean. In the preface to\r\nthat work he used the word Australia as \"comprehending the discoveries at\r\na distance from America to the eastward.\"* (* Page 15 of the 1780 edition\r\nof Dalrymple.) He did not intend it to include the present Australia at\r\nall. De Brosses had used the three names Magellanica, Polynesia and\r\nAustralasia, which Dalrymple accepted; but he thought there was room for\r\na fourth for the area east of South America. The part of the Australian\r\ncontinent known when Dalrymple published his book--only the west and\r\nnorthern coasts--was included within the division which De Brosses called\r\nAustralasia.\r\n\r\nHere we have three instances of the use of the word Australia in the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but without reference to the\r\ncontinent which now bears that name.\r\n\r\nIn 1793, G. Shaw and J.E. Smith published in London a Zoology and Botany\r\nof New Holland. Here the word Australia was used in its modern sense, as\r\napplied to the southern continent. The authors wrote of \"the vast island,\r\nor rather continent, of Australia, Australasia, or New Holland, which has\r\nso lately attracted the particular attention of European navigators and\r\nnaturalists.\"\r\n\r\nThe word was not therefore of Flinders' devising. But it may be taken to\r\nbe certain that he was unacquainted with the previous employment of it by\r\nthe Dutch indexer, by Foigny's English translator, or by Shaw and Smith.\r\nIt is doubtful whether he had observed the previous use of it by\r\nDalrymple. Undoubtedly he had read that author's book. He may have had\r\nthe volumes in his cabin library. But he was so exact and scrupulous a\r\nman that we can say with confidence that, had he remembered the\r\noccurrence of the word in Dalrymple, he would have mentioned the fact.\r\nThe point is not material, however, because, as already observed,\r\nDalrymple did not apply \"Australia\" to this continent, but to a different\r\nregion. The essential point is that \"Australia was reinvented by\r\nFlinders.\"* (* Morris, Dictionary of Austral English page 10.)\r\n\r\nFlinders felt the need of a single word that would be a good name for the\r\nisland which had been demonstrated by his own researches to be one great\r\ncontinent. It will be remembered that he had investigated the whole\r\nextent of the southern coasts, had penetrated to the extremities of the\r\ntwo great gulfs found there, had proved that they did not open into a\r\npassage cutting Terra Australis in two, and had thoroughly examined the\r\nGulf of Carpentaria, finding no inlet southward there. The country was\r\nclearly one immense whole. But what was it to be called? Terra Australis,\r\nSouthern Land, was too long, was cumbrous, was Latin. That would not be a\r\nconvenient name for a country that was to play any part in the world. The\r\nDutch had named the part which they found New Holland. But they knew\r\nnothing of the east. Cook called the part which he had discovered New\r\nSouth Wales. But Cook knew nothing of the west. Neither the Dutch nor\r\nCook knew anything of the south, a large part of which Flinders himself\r\nhad discovered.\r\n\r\nWe find him for the first time using the word \"Australia\" in a letter\r\nwritten to his brother Samuel on August 25th, 1804.* (* Flinders'\r\nPapers.) He was then living at Wilhelm's Plains: \"I call the whole island\r\nAustralia, or Terra Australis. New Holland is properly that portion of it\r\nfrom 135 degrees of longitude westward; and eastward is New South Wales,\r\naccording to the Governor's patent.\"\r\n\r\nFlinders' first public use of the word was not in English, but in French.\r\nIn the essay on the probable fate of Laperouse, written for the Societe\r\nd'Emulation in Ile-de-France (1807), he again stated the need for a word\r\nin terms which I translate as follows: \"The examination of the eastern\r\npart was commenced in 1770 by Captain Cook, and has since been completed\r\nby English navigators.* (* By himself; but in this paper he modestly said\r\nnothing of his own researches.) The first (i.e., the west) is New Holland\r\nproperly so called, and the second bears the name of New South Wales. I\r\nhave considered it convenient to unite the two parts under a common\r\ndesignation which will do justice to the discovery rights of Holland and\r\nEngland, and I have with that object in view had recourse to the name\r\nAustral-land or Australia. But it remains to be seen whether the name\r\nwill be adopted by European geographers.\"* (* \"Il reste a savoir si ce\r\nnom sera adopte par des geographes europeens.\" The paper was printed in\r\nthe Annales des Voyages by Malte-Brun (Paris, 1810). Flinders kept a\r\ncopy, and his manuscript is now in the Melbourne Public Library. It is an\r\nexquisite piece of calligraphy, perhaps the most beautifully written of\r\nall his manuscripts.)\r\n\r\nAfter 1804 Flinders repeatedly used the word Australia in his\r\ncorrespondence. Before that date he had invariably written of \"New\r\nHolland.\" But in a letter to Banks (December 31st, 1804) he referred to\r\n\"my general chart of Australia;\"* (* Historical Records 5 531.) in March,\r\n1806, he wrote of \"the north-west coast of Australia;\"* (* Ibid 6 50.) in\r\nJuly, 1806, writing to the King he underlined the word in the phrase \"my\r\ndiscoveries in Australia;\"* (* Ibid 6 107.) in July, 1807, he spoke of\r\n\"the north coast of Australia;\"* (* Ibid 6 274.) in February, 1809, of\r\n\"the south coast of Australia;\"* (* Ibid 7 52.) and the same phrase was\r\nemployed in January, 1810.* (* Ibid 7 275.) It is therefore apparent that\r\nbefore his return to England he had determined to use the name\r\nsystematically and to make its employment general as far as he could. We\r\ndo not find it occurring in any other correspondence of the period.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached England in 1810 and commenced to work upon his book, he\r\nwished to use the name Australia, and brought the subject forward at a\r\nmeeting at Sir Joseph Banks' house. But Banks was not favourable, and\r\nArrowsmith, the chart-publisher, \"did not like the change\" because his\r\nfirm had always used the name New Holland in their charts. A Major\r\nRennell was present at one of the meetings, when Flinders thought he had\r\nconverted Sir Joseph. But afterwards he found Banks disinclined to\r\nsanction the name, and wrote to Major Rennell asking whether he\r\nremembered the conversation. The Major replied (August 15th, 1812):* (*\r\nFlinders' Papers.) \"I certainly think that it was as you say, that\r\nAustralia was the proper name for the continent in question; and for the\r\nreason you mention. I suppose I must have been of that opinion at the\r\ntime, for I certainly think so now. It wants a collective name.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days after the receipt of Major Rennell's letter Flinders wrote to\r\nBanks, reminding him that he was the first person consulted about the\r\nname Australia, and that he had understood that it was generally\r\napproved. Bligh had not objected to it. When part of the manuscript of\r\nthe Voyage was submitted to Mr. Robert Peel, Under-Secretary for the\r\nColonies (afterwards Sir Robert Peel and Prime Minister of England), and\r\nto Lord Liverpool, the principal Secretary of State, there had been some\r\ndiscussion respecting the inclusion of the Gulf of Carpentaria as part of\r\nNew South Wales, and it was accordingly erased. But no objection was\r\nraised to the name Australia. Flinders fought hard for his word, but did\r\nnot succeed completely. Captain Burney suggested that Terra Australis was\r\na name \"more familiar to the public.\" Banks on August 19th withdrew his\r\nobjection to \"the propriety of calling New Holland and New South Wales by\r\nthe collective name of Terra Australis,\" and accordingly as A Voyage to\r\nTerra Australis his book ultimately went forth. The work being published\r\nunder the aegis of the Admiralty, he had to conform to the opinion of\r\nthose who were less sensible of the need for an innovation than he was,\r\nand it was only in a modest footnote that he used the name he preferred.\r\nThe passage in the book wherein he discussed the question may be quoted,\r\ntogether with his footnote:\r\n\r\n\"The vast regions to which this voyage was principally directed\r\ncomprehend, in the western part, the early discoveries of the Dutch,\r\nunder the name of New Holland; and in the east the coasts explored by\r\nBritish navigators, and named New South Wales. It has not, however, been\r\nunusual to apply the first appellation to both regions; but to continue\r\nthis would be almost as great an injustice to the British nation, whose\r\nseamen have had so large a share in the discovery as it would be to the\r\nDutch were New South Wales to be so extended. This appears to have been\r\nfelt by a neighbouring, and even rival, nation; whose writers commonly\r\nspeak of these countries under the general term of Terres Australes. In\r\nfact, the original name, used by the Dutch themselves until some time\r\nafter Tasman's second voyage in 1644, was Terra Australis, or 'Great\r\nSouth Land;' and, when it was displaced by 'New Holland,' the new term\r\nwas applied only to the parts lying westward of a meridian line passing\r\nthrough Arnhem's Land on the north, and near the isles of St. Francis and\r\nSt. Peter on the south; all to the eastward, including the shores of the\r\nGulf of Carpentaria, still remained as Terra Australis. This appears from\r\na chart published by Thevenot in 1663; which, he says 'was originally\r\ntaken from that done in inlaid work upon the pavement of the new\r\nStadt-House at Amsterdam.' The same thing is to be inferred from the\r\nnotes of Burgomaster Witsen in 1705 of which there will be occasion to\r\nspeak in the sequel.\r\n\r\n\"It is necessary, however, to geographical precision, that so soon as New\r\nHolland and New South Wales were known to form one land, there should be\r\na general name applicable to the whole; and this essential point having\r\nbeen ascertained in the present voyage, with a degree of certainty\r\nsufficient to authorise the measure, I have, with the concurrence of\r\nopinions entitled to deference, ventured upon the adoption of the\r\noriginal Terra Australis; and of this term I shall hereafter make use\r\nwhen speaking of New Holland and New South Wales in a collective sense;\r\nand when using it in the most extensive signification, the adjacent\r\nisles, including that of Van Diemen, must be understood to be\r\ncomprehended.\r\n\r\n\"There is no probability that any other detached body of land, of nearly\r\nequal extent, will ever be found in a more southern latitude; the name\r\nTerra Australis will, therefore, remain descriptive of the geographical\r\nimportance of this country, and its situation on the globe, it has\r\nantiquity to recommend it; and, having no reference to either of the two\r\nclaiming nations, appears to be less objectionable than any other which\r\ncould have been selected.\"\r\n\r\nThen comes the footnote in which the name Australia is suggested:\r\n\r\n\"Had I permitted myself any innovation upon the original term, it would\r\nhave been to convert it into Australia; as being more agreeable to the\r\near, and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions of the\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\nThe name came into general use after the publication of Flinders' book,\r\nthough it was not always adopted in official documents. Governor\r\nMacquarie, of New South Wales, in a despatch in April, 1817, expressed\r\nthe hope that the name would be authoritatively sanctioned.* (* See M.\r\nPhillips, A Colonial Autocracy, London 1909 page 2 note.) As already\r\nnoted, the officials of 1849 drew a distinction between New Holland, the\r\nmainland, and Australia, which included the island of Tasmania; and so\r\nSir Charles Fitzroy, Governor of New South Wales, was styled\r\n\"Governor-General of Australia,\" in a commission dated 1851. The proudest\r\nof all places wherein this name is used is in the forefront of the\r\nmajestic instrument cited as 63 and 64 Vict., cap. 12--\"An Act to\r\nconstitute the Commonwealth of Australia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\nBAUDIN'S ACCOUNT OF ENCOUNTER BAY.\r\n\r\n[In a long letter of about 30,000 words, written to the French Minister\r\nof Marine from Port Jackson in 1802, Captain Baudin described his\r\nexplorations in Australian waters up to that date. The manuscript is in\r\nthe Archives Nationales, Paris, BB4, 995, Marine. It has never been\r\npublished. In this appendix, which relates to Chapter 14 of the book, I\r\ntranslate the portion of the letter concerning the meeting of the\r\nInvestigator and Le Geographe in Encounter Bay, with a few notes.]\r\n\r\n\"On the 18th,* (* Note 1: That is, the 18th Germinal in the French\r\nrevolutionary calendar; April 8th by the Gregorian calendar.) continuing\r\nto follow the coast and the various coves upon it, we sighted towards the\r\nnorth-east a long chain of high mountains, which appeared to terminate at\r\nthe border of the sea. The weariness we had for a long time experienced\r\nat seeing coasts which for the most part were arid, and offered not the\r\nslightest resource, was dissipated by the expectation of coming upon a\r\nmore promising country. A little later, a still more agreeable object of\r\ndistraction presented itself to our view. A square-sailed ship was\r\nperceived ahead. Nobody on board had any doubt that it was Le\r\nNaturaliste. As she was tacking south and we were tacking north, we\r\napproached each other. But what was our astonishment when the other\r\nvessel hoisted a white flag on the mainmast. It was beyond doubt a signal\r\nof recognition, to which we responded. A little later, that signal was\r\nhauled down, and an English ensign and pennant were substituted.* (* Note\r\n2: Flinders says: \"Our colours being hoisted, she showed a French ensign,\r\nand afterwards an English jack forward, as we did a white flag.\") We\r\nreplied by hoisting our colours; and we continued to advance towards each\r\nother. The manoeuvre of the English ship indicating that she desired to\r\nspeak to us, we stood towards her.* (* Note 3: Flinders' own explanation\r\nof his manoeuvring is: \"We veered round as Le Geographe was passing so as\r\nto keep our broadside to her lest the flag of truce should be a\r\ndeception.\") When we got within hail, a voice enquired what ship we were.\r\nI replied simply that we were French. \"Is that Captain Baudin?\" \"Yes, it\r\nis he.\" The English captain then saluted me graciously, saying \"I am very\r\nglad to meet you.\" I replied to the same effect, without knowing to whom\r\nI was speaking; but, seeing that arrangements were being made for someone\r\nto come on board, I brought the ship to.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Flinders, who commanded the English vessel, presented himself. As\r\nsoon as I learnt his name, I no longer doubted that he, like ourselves,\r\nwas occupied with the exploration of the south coast of New Holland; and,\r\nin spite of the reserve that he showed upon that first visit, I could\r\neasily perceive that he had already completed a part of it. Having\r\ninvited him to come into my cabin, and finding ourselves alone there, the\r\nconversation became freer.* (* Note 4: \"Nous trouvant seul, la\r\nconversation devint plus libre.\" Flinders says that Brown accompanied\r\nhim, and went into the cabin with him. \"No person was present at our\r\nconversations except Mr. Brown.\")\r\n\r\n\"He informed me that he had left Europe about eight months after us, and\r\nthat he was bound for Port Jackson, having previously refreshed at the\r\nCape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\n\"I had no hesitation about giving him information concerning what we had\r\nbeen doing upon the coast until that moment. I pointed out to him defects\r\nwhich I had observed in the chart which he had published* of the strait\r\nseparating New Holland from Van Diemen's Land, etc., etc. (* Note 5: \"la\r\ncarte qu'il nous a donne des detroits.\" From this it appears that Baudin\r\nknew Flinders as the author of the chart, even while pointing out its\r\ndefects. Flinders had the impression that Baudin did not know him till he\r\nwas about to leave Le Geographe at the end of the second interview.)\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Flinders observed to me that he was not unaware that the chart\r\nrequired to be checked, inasmuch as the sketch from which it was prepared\r\nhad been drawn from uncertain information, and that the means employed\r\nwhen the discovery was made did not conduce to securing exact results.*\r\n(* Note 6: Flinders: \"On my pointing out a note upon the chart,\r\nexplaining that the north side of the strait was seen only in an open\r\nboat by Mr. Bass, who had no good means of fixing either latitude or\r\nlongitude, he appeared surprised, not having before paid attention to\r\nit.\") Finally, becoming less circumspect than he had hitherto been, he\r\ntold me that he had commenced his work at Cape Leeuwin, and had followed\r\nthe coast to the place where we were met. He suggested that our ships\r\nshould pass the night near together, and that early on the following\r\nmorning he should come on board again, and give me some particulars which\r\nwould be useful to me. I accepted his proposition with pleasure, and we\r\ntacked about at a short distance from each other during the night. It was\r\nseven o'clock in the evening when he returned to his ship.* (* Note 7:\r\nFlinders: \"I told him that some other and more particular charts of the\r\nstrait and its neighbourhood had since been published; and that if he\r\nwould keep company until next morning I would bring him a copy with a\r\nsmall memoir belonging to them. This was agreed to.\")\r\n\r\n\"On the 19th* (* Note 8: April 9th.) Mr. Flinders came on board at six\r\no'clock in the morning. We breakfasted together,* (* Note 9: Flinders\r\ndoes not mention this incident.) and talked about our respective work. He\r\nappeared to me to have been happier than we had been with respect to the\r\ndiscoveries he had made. He told me about a large island, about a dozen\r\nor fifteen leagues away, which had been visited by him. According to his\r\naccount, he stayed there six weeks to prepare a chart of it;* (* Note 10:\r\nA mistake; Flinders was at Kangaroo Island only six days.) and with the\r\naid of a corvette* (* Note 11: Peron also had the erroneous impression\r\nthat the Investigator had been accompanied by a corvette, which foundered\r\nin Spencer's Gulf, and so wrote in his Voyage de Decouvertes. Baudin must\r\nhave confused what Flinders told him about the drowning of Thistle and\r\nthe boat's crew, with an idea of his own that this boat was a consort of\r\nthe Investigator as Le Naturaliste was of Le Geographe.) had explored two\r\ndeep gulfs, the direction of which he sketched for me, as well as of his\r\nKangaroo Island, which he had so named in consequence of the great\r\nquantity of those quadrupeds found there. The island, though not far from\r\nthe continent, did not appear to him to be inhabited.\r\n\r\n\"An accident like that which had unfortunately happened to us on the\r\ncoast of Van Diemen's Land had overtaken Mr. Flinders.* (* Note 12:\r\nBaudin was referring to a boat party of his own, consisting of\r\nBoullanger, one of his hydrographers, a lieutenant and eight sailors.\r\nThey had gone out in a boat to chart a portion of the coast which Le\r\nGeographe could not reach. They did not return, and Baudin supposed them\r\nto have been lost. But they were in fact picked up by the sealing brig\r\nSnow-Harrington from Sydney, which afterwards sighted Le Naturaliste, and\r\nhanded the men over to her.) He had lost a boat and eight men. His ship\r\nwas also short of stores, and he was not without uneasiness as to what\r\nwould happen.\r\n\r\n\"Before we separated the Captain asked me if I had any knowledge of an\r\nisland which was said to exist to the north of the Bass Strait islands. I\r\nreplied that I had not, inasmuch as, having followed the coast fairly\r\nclosely after leaving the Promontory as far as Westernport, I had not met\r\nwith any land placed in the position which he indicated.* (* Note 13:\r\nWhat Flinders asked Baudin was whether he had any \"knowledge concerning a\r\nlarge island said to lie in the western entrance of Bass Strait. But he\r\nhad not seen it and seemed to doubt much of its existence.\" The reference\r\nwas to King Island. Baudin marked on his chart, in consequence of this\r\nenquiry, an island \"believed to exist,\" guessing at its situation and\r\nplacing it wrongly; though he subsequently stayed at King Island\r\nhimself.) He appeared to be well pleased with my response, doubtless in\r\nthe hope of being the first to discover it. Perhaps Le Naturaliste, in\r\nsearching for us in the Strait, will have discovered it.* (* Note 14:\r\nThis sentence is interesting, as showing that Baudin wrote this part of\r\nhis letter to the Minister at the time, not at Port Jackson weeks later.\r\nIf the sentence had been written later, he would not have said that Le\r\nNaturaliste would perhaps sight the island. He by then knew that she did\r\nnot.) At the moment of his departure, Mr. Flinders presented me with\r\nseveral new charts, published by Arrowsmith, and a printed memoir by\r\nhimself, dealing with discoveries in the strait, the north coast of Van\r\nDiemen's Land, the east coast, etc., etc. He also invited me to sail,\r\nlike himself, for Port Jackson, the resources of which he perhaps exalted\r\ntoo highly, if I had to remain long in these seas. At eight o'clock we*\r\nseparated. (* Note 15: Flinders: \"I returned with Mr. Brown on board the\r\nInvestigator at half-past-eight in the morning, and we then separated\r\nfrom Le Geographe; Captain Baudin's course being directed to the\r\nnorth-west and ours to the southward.\") He sailed south and we went to\r\nthe west.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B. PERON'S REPORT ON PORT JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[The following is a fairly literal translation of Peron's report on Port\r\nJackson, furnished to General Decaen at Ile-de-France.]\r\n\r\nPort N.-O., 20th Frimaire, Year 12.* (* Note 16: i.e., Port North-West\r\n(Port Louis), December 11, 1802.)\r\n\r\nCitizen Captain-General,\r\n\r\nFifteen years ago England transported, at great expense, a numerous\r\npopulation to the eastern coast of New Holland. At that time this vast\r\ncontinent was still almost entirely unknown. These southern lands and the\r\nnumerous archipelagoes of the Pacific were invaded by the English, who\r\nhad solemnly proclaimed themselves sovereign over the whole dominion\r\nextending from Cape York to the southern extremity of New Holland, that\r\nis to say, from 10 degrees 37 minutes south, to 43 degrees 39 minutes\r\nsouth latitude. In longitude their possessions had been fixed as reaching\r\nfrom 105 degrees west of Greenwich to the middle of the Pacific Ocean,\r\nincluding all the archipelagos with which it is strewn.* (* Note 17: This\r\nis a literal translation of Peron's statement, which is obviously\r\nconfused and wrong. 105 degrees west longitude is east of Easter Island,\r\nas well as being an \"exact boundary\" in the Pacific, which, Peron goes on\r\nto say, did not exist. The probability is that he gives here a muddled\r\nreproduction of the boundaries actually fixed by Phillip's\r\ncommission--\"westward as far as the 135th degree of east\r\nlongitude...including all the islands adjacent in the Pacific Ocean.\"\r\n[Mr. Jose's note.])\r\n\r\nNote especially in this respect that in the formal deed of annexation no\r\nexact boundary was fixed on the Pacific Ocean side. This omission seems\r\nto have been the result of astute policy; the English Government thus\r\nprepared itself an excuse for claiming, at the right time and place, all\r\nthe islands which in the future may be, or actually are, occupied by the\r\nSpaniards--who thus find themselves England's next-door neighbours.\r\n\r\nSo general a project of encroachment alarmed, as it must, all the nations\r\nof Europe. The sacrifices made by England to maintain this colony\r\nredoubled their suspicions. The Spanish expedition of Admiral Malaspina*\r\nhad not fulfilled the expectations of its Government. (* Note 18: Two\r\nSpanish ships, commanded by Don Alexandro Malaspina, visited Sydney in\r\nApril, 1793. They had left Cadiz on an exploring and scientific\r\nexpedition in July, 1789.) Europe was still ignorant of the nature of the\r\nEnglish settlement; its object was unknown; its rapid growth was not even\r\nsuspected.\r\n\r\nAlways vigilant in regard to whatever may humiliate the eternal rival of\r\nour nation, the First Consul, soon after the revolution of the 18th\r\nBrumaire,* (* Note 19: It was on the 18th Brumaire (November 9th, 1799)\r\nthat Bonaparte overthrew the Directory by a coup-d'etat, and became First\r\nConsul of the French Republic.) decided upon our expedition.* (* Note 20:\r\nPeron's statement is quite wrong. The matter of despatching an expedition\r\nto Australia had been considered and proposed to the Government by the\r\nprofessors of the Museum two years before the coup-d'etat of Brumaire:\r\nbefore therefore Bonaparte had anything to do with the Government. Their\r\nletter to the Minister, making this proposal, is dated 12th Thermidor,\r\nyear 6--that is, July 31st, 1797. Bonaparte was then a young general\r\ncommanding the army of Italy. The project was taken up by the Institute\r\nof France, and Bonaparte, as First Consul, sanctioned the expedition in\r\nMay, 1800. There is no evidence that he ever gave a thought to the matter\r\nuntil it was brought before him by the Institute.) His real object was\r\nsuch that it was indispensable to conceal it from the Governments of\r\nEurope, and especially from the Cabinet of St. James's. We must have\r\ntheir unanimous consent; and that we might obtain this, it was necessary\r\nthat, strangers in appearance to all political designs, we should occupy\r\nourselves only with natural history collections. Such a large expenditure\r\nhad been incurred to augment the collections of the Museum of the\r\nRepublic that the object of our voyage could not but appear to all the\r\nworld as a natural consequence of the previous action of our Government.\r\nIt was far from being the case, however, that our true purpose had to be\r\nconfined to that class of work; and if sufficient time permitted it would\r\nbe very easy for me, citizen Captain-General, to demonstrate to you that\r\nall our natural history researches, extolled with so much ostentation by\r\nthe Government, were merely a pretext for its enterprise, and were\r\nintended to assure for it the most general and complete success. So that\r\nour expedition, so much criticised by fault-finders, so much neglected by\r\nthe former administrators of this colony, was in its principle, in its\r\npurpose, in its organization, one of those brilliant and important\r\nconceptions which ought to make our present Government for ever\r\nillustrious. Why was it that, after having done so much for the success\r\nof these designs, the execution of them was confided to a man utterly\r\nunfitted in all possible respects to conduct them to their proper issue?\r\n\r\nYou have asked me, General, to communicate to you such information as I\r\nhave been able to procure upon the colony of Port Jackson. A work of that\r\nkind would be as long as it would be important; and, prepared as I\r\nconceive it ought to be, and as I hope it will be when presented to the\r\nFrench Government, it would fix our attention to some useful purpose upon\r\nthat growing snare of a redoubtable power. Unfortunately, duty has made\r\ndemands upon me until to-day, and now that I find myself a little freer\r\nour departure is about to take place. Moreover, all the information we\r\nhave collected upon the regions in question is deposited in the chest\r\nwhich has to be forwarded, sealed, to the Government, and without access\r\nto this the notes that I should desire to furnish to you cannot be\r\ncompleted. Nevertheless, in order to contribute as far as possible to\r\nyour enlightenment on the subject, I take the liberty of furnishing you\r\nwith some particulars of the new establishment. In asking you to excuse,\r\non account of the circumstances, faults both of style and of\r\npresentation, I venture to assure you, General, that you can rely upon my\r\njealous exactitude in fulfilling as far as was in my power the intention\r\nof the Government of my country. I have neglected no means of procuring\r\nall the information that as far as I could foresee would be of interest.\r\nI was received in the house of the Governor with much consideration. He\r\nand his secretary spoke our language well. The commandant of the troops\r\nof New South Wales, Mr. Paterson, a member of the Royal Society of\r\nLondon, a very distinguished savant, always treated me with particular\r\nregard. I was received in his house, as one might say, as a son. I have\r\nthrough him known all the officials of the colony. The surgeon, a\r\ndistinguished man, Mr. Thompson, honoured me with his friendship. Mr.\r\nGrimes, the surveyor of the colony, Mr. Palmer the commissary-general of\r\nthe Government, Mr. Marsden, a clergyman of Parramatta, and a cultivator\r\nas wealthy as he is discerning, were all capable of furnishing me with\r\nvaluable information. My functions on board permitted me to hazard the\r\nasking of a large number of questions which would have been indiscreet on\r\nthe part of another, particularly on the part of soldiers. I have, in a\r\nword, known at Port Jackson all the principal people of the colony, in\r\nall vocations, and each of them has furnished, unsuspectingly,\r\ninformation as valuable as it is new. Finally, I made with Mr. Paterson\r\nvery long excursions into the interior of the country. I saw most of the\r\nbest farms, and I assure you that I have gathered everywhere interesting\r\nideas upon things, which I have taken care to make exact as possible.\r\n\r\nFIRST: PRESENT ESTABLISHMENTS OF THE ENGLISH.\r\n\r\nWhilst in Europe they are spoken of as the colony of Botany Bay, as a\r\nmatter of fact there is no establishment there. Botany Bay is a humid,\r\nmarshy, rather sterile place, not healthy, and the anchorage for vessels\r\nis neither good nor sure.\r\n\r\nPort Jackson, thirteen leagues from Botany Bay, is unquestionably one of\r\nthe finest ports in the world. It was in these terms that Governor\r\nPhillip spoke of it, and certainly he did not exaggerate when he added\r\nthat a thousand ships of the line could easily manoeuvre within it. The\r\ntown of Sydney has been founded in the heart of this superb harbour. It\r\nis already considerable in extent, and, like its population, is growing\r\nrapidly. Here reside the Governor and all the principal Government\r\nofficers. The environs of Sydney are sandy and not very fertile; in\r\nalmost all of them there is a scarcity of water during the hot summer\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nParramatta is the largest town founded by the English. It is in the\r\ninterior of the country, about six leagues from Sydney, from which it can\r\nbe reached by a small river called the Parramatta River. Small vessels\r\ncan proceed close to the town; larger ones have to discharge some\r\ndistance away. A very fine road leads overland from Sydney to Parramatta.\r\nSome very good houses have been built here and there along the road.\r\nAlready people who have made considerable fortunes are to be found there.\r\nThe land around Parramatta is of much better quality than that at Sydney.\r\nThe country has been cleared to a considerable extent; and grazing in\r\nparticular presents important advantages.\r\n\r\nToongabbie, further inland, three or four leagues from Parramatta, is\r\nstill more fertile. Its pastures are excellent. It is there that the\r\nflocks belonging to the Government have been established.\r\n\r\nHawkesbury, more than 60 miles from Sydney, is in the vicinity of the\r\nBlue Mountains. It is the richest and most fruitful of the English\r\nestablishments. It may be regarded as the granary of the colony, being\r\ncapable by itself of supplying nearly all the wants of the settlement.\r\nThe depth of soil in some parts is as much as 80 feet; and it is truly\r\nprodigious in point of fertility. These incalculable advantages are due\r\nto the alluvial deposits of the Hawkesbury River, which descends in\r\ncascades from the summits of the Blue Mountains, and precipitates itself\r\nupon the plain loaded with a thick mud of a quality eminently suitable\r\nfor promoting vegetable growth. Unfortunately with benefits such as are\r\nconferred by the Nile it unites its inconveniences. It is subject to\r\nfrightful floods, which overwhelm everything. Houses, crops, and\r\nflocks--everything is destroyed unless men and animals save themselves by\r\nvery rapid flight. These unexpected floods are sometimes so prodigious\r\nthat the water has been known to rise 60 and even 80 feet above the\r\nnormal level. But what gives a great importance to the town of Hawkesbury\r\nis the facility with which large ships can reach it by the river of which\r\nI have just spoken. This part of New Holland will be a source of rapid\r\nand very large fortunes.\r\n\r\nCastle Hill is a new establishment in the interior of New Holland,\r\ndistant 21 miles from Parramatta, from which it is reached by a superb\r\nroad, which traverses thick forests. Allotments of land are crowded round\r\nthis place, and the clearances are so considerable that for more than a\r\nleague all round the town we could see the forest grants being burnt off.\r\n\r\nRichmond Hill, towards the Hawkesbury, is a more considerable place than\r\nthe last mentioned, and is in a fertile situation.\r\n\r\nSo, General, it will be seen that this colony, which people in Europe\r\nstill believe to be relegated to the muddy marshes of Botany Bay, is\r\ndaily absorbing more and more of the interior of the continent. Cities\r\nare being erected, which, at present in their infancy, present evidences\r\nof future grandeur. Spacious and well-constructed roads facilitate\r\ncommunication with all parts, whilst important rivers render access by\r\nwater still more convenient and less expensive.\r\n\r\nBut the English Government is no longer confining its operations to the\r\neastern coast of New Holland. Westernport, on the extreme south, beyond\r\nWilson's Promontory, is already engaging its attention. At the time of\r\nour departure a new establishment there was in contemplation. The\r\nGovernment is balancing the expediency of founding a new colony there or\r\nat Port Phillip, to the north.* (* Note 21: \"Le Port Phillip dans le nord\r\nde ce dernier.\" Peron's information was correct. King had in May, 1802,\r\nmade a recommendation to the British Government that a settlement should\r\nbe founded at Port Phillip. The reasons, also, are stated accurately by\r\nhim.) In any case, it is indubitable, from what I have heard the Governor\r\nsay--it is indubitable, I say, that such a step will soon be taken.\r\nIndeed, whatever advantage Port Jackson may possess, it suffers from a\r\ngrave disadvantage in the narrowness of its entry. Two frigates could by\r\nthemselves blockade the most numerous fleet within. Westernport would in\r\ncertain eventualities offer an advantageous position. Moreover, the\r\nnavigation of Bass Strait is very dangerous. The winds there are\r\nterrible. Before negotiating the strait, ships from Europe, fatigued by a\r\nlong voyage, require succour and shelter. The new establishment will be\r\nable to accommodate them. A third reason, and no doubt the most\r\nimportant, is that the English in spite of all their efforts, in spite of\r\nthe devotion of several of their citizens, in spite of the sacrifices\r\nmade by the Government, have not yet been able to traverse the\r\nredoubtable barrier of the Blue Mountains and to penetrate into the west\r\nof New Holland. An establishment on the part of the coast that I have\r\njust mentioned would guarantee them success in their efforts in that\r\ndirection. At all events it is indubitable that the establishment to\r\nwhich I have referred will be immediately founded, if indeed such is not\r\nalready the case, as appears very probable from the letter which the\r\nGovernor wrote to our commandant in that regard a few days after our\r\ndeparture from Port Jackson.\r\n\r\nSo then, the English, already masters of the eastern coast of New\r\nHolland, now wish to occupy the immense extent of the west and south-west\r\ncoasts which contain very fine harbours, namely, that which they call\r\nWesternport, Port Phillip, Port Flinders* (* Note 22: Peron probably\r\nmeant the present Port Augusta in Spencer's Gulf; but the name Port\r\nFlinders was his own.) at the head of one of the great gulfs of the\r\nsouth-west, Port Esperance, discovered by Dentrecasteaux, King George's\r\nSound, etc.\r\n\r\nBut still more, General, their ambition, always aspiring, is not confined\r\nto New Holland itself, vast as it may be. Van Diemen's Land, and\r\nespecially the magnificent Dentrecasteaux Channel, have excited their\r\ncupidity. Another establishment has probably been founded there since our\r\ndeparture from Port Jackson. Take a glance at the detailed chart of that\r\npart of Van Diemen's Land. Look at the cluster of bays and harbours to be\r\nfound there, and judge for yourself whether it is likely that that\r\nambitious nation will permit any other power to occupy them. Therefore,\r\nnumerous preparations had been made for the occupation of that important\r\npoint. The authorities were only awaiting a frigate, the Porpoise,* (*\r\nNote 23: Peron spells the name as it sounded to him, La Poraperse.) to\r\ntransport colonists and provisions. That establishment is probably in\r\nexistence to-day.* (* Note 24: Again, Peron's information was correct. A\r\nsettlement on the Derwent, close to Dentrecasteaux Channel, was ordered\r\nto be founded in March, 1803, and the Porpoise, with the Lady Nelson as\r\ntender, was employed to carry colonists and supplies thither.) Several\r\nreasons will have determined it; First: The indispensable necessity, for\r\nthe English, of keeping away from their establishments in that part of\r\nthe world rivals and neighbours as redoubtable as the French; Second: The\r\ndesire of removing from occupation by any other nation those impregnable\r\nports whence their important trade with New Zealand might be destroyed\r\nand their principal establishment itself be eventually shaken; Third: The\r\nfertility of the soil in that part of Van Diemen's Land, and above all\r\nthe hope of discovering in the vast granite plateaux, which seems here to\r\nenclose the world, mines of precious metals or some new substance unknown\r\nto the stupid aboriginals of the country.\r\n\r\nI will not refer in detail to the Furneaux and Hunter's Islands, to King\r\nIsland and Maria Island. Everywhere the British flag is flown with pride.\r\nEverywhere profitable fisheries are established. Seals of various\r\nspecies, to be found upon these islands, open up a new source of wealth\r\nand power to the English nation.\r\n\r\nBut New Zealand is especially advantageous to them in that regard. There\r\nis the principal seat of the wealth of their new colony. Thence a large\r\nnumber of ships sail annually for Europe laden with whale oil. Never, as\r\nthe English themselves acknowledge, was a fishery so lucrative and so\r\neasy. The number of vessels engaged in it is increasing rapidly. Four\r\nyears ago there were but four or five. Last year there were seventeen.*\r\n(* Note 25: It will be remembered that Bass intended to engage in the New\r\nZealand fishery. Cf. chapter 9.) I shall have occasion to return to this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nLet us sum up what has been said concerning the English establishments in\r\nthis part of the world. Masters of the east coast of New Holland, we see\r\nthem rapidly penetrating the interior of the country, clearing pressed\r\nforward on all sides, towns multiplying. Everywhere there is hope of\r\nabundance of great agricultural wealth. The south coast is menaced by\r\ncoming encroachments, which, perhaps, are by now effected. All the ports\r\nof the south-west will be occupied successively, and much sooner than is\r\ncommonly thought. Van Diemen's Land and all the neighbouring islands\r\neither are to be occupied or already are so. New Zealand offers to them,\r\ntogether with excellent harbours, an extraordinarily abundant and\r\nlucrative fishery. In a word, everything in these vast regions presents a\r\npicture of unequalled activity, unlimited foresight, swollen ambition,\r\nand a policy as deep as it is vigilant.\r\n\r\nWell then--come forward now to the middle of these vast seas, so long\r\nunknown; we shall see everywhere the same picture reproduced, with the\r\nsame effects. Cast a glance over that great southern ocean. Traverse all\r\nthose archipelagos which, like so many stepping-stones, are scattered\r\nbetween New Holland and the west coast of America. It is by their means\r\nthat England hopes to be able to stretch her dominion as far as Peru.\r\nNorfolk Island has for a long time been occupied. The cedar that it\r\nproduces, coupled with the great fertility of the soil, render it an\r\nimportant possession. It contains already between 1500 and 1800\r\ncolonists. No settlement has as yet been founded in any of the other\r\nislands, but researches are being pursued in all parts. The English land\r\nupon all the islands and establish an active commerce, by means of\r\nbarter, with the natives. The Sandwich Islands, Friendly Islands, Loyalty\r\nIslands,* (* Note 26: New Caledonian Group.) Navigator Islands,* (* Note\r\n27: Samoan Group.) Marquesas and Mendore Islands all furnish excellent\r\nsalt provisions. Ships, employed in trade, frequently arrive at Port\r\nJackson; and it increases every day, proof positive of the advantage that\r\nis derived from it.\r\n\r\nThe Government is particularly occupied with endeavouring to discover\r\nupon some one of these archipelagos a strong military post, a species of\r\narsenal, nearer to the coasts of Peru and Chili.* (* Note 28: This\r\nstatement was entirely false.) It is towards these two points that the\r\nEnglish Government appears to be especially turning its eyes. They are\r\nquite aware of the feebleness of the Spaniards in South America. They are\r\nabove all aware that the unconquered Chilians are constantly making\r\nunexpected attacks, that like so many Bedouins they appear unawares with\r\na numerous cavalry upon places where the Spaniards are most feeble,\r\ncommitting robberies and outrages in all directions before sufficient\r\nforces have been collected to repulse them. Then they retire with a\r\npromptitude which does not permit of their being followed to their savage\r\nfastnesses, which are unknown to the Spaniards themselves--retreats\r\nwhence they very soon reappear, to commit fresh massacres. (See the\r\nVoyage of Laperouse). The English, to whom nothing that occurs in those\r\nimportant regions is unknown, are equally aware that it is simply a\r\ndeficiency in arms and ammunition which prevents the redoubtable Chilians\r\nfrom pushing much farther their attacks against the Spaniards. It is to\r\nthe furnishing of these means that the English Government are at the\r\npresent moment confining their enterprise. A very active contraband trade\r\nis calculated to enable them to carry out their perfidious ends, whilst\r\nat the same time providing a profitable market for the produce of their\r\nmanufacturers. Another manner in which they torment the Spaniards of Peru\r\nis by despatching a swarm of pirates to these seas. During the last war\r\nvery rich prizes were captured by simple whaling vessels, and you can\r\njudge what attacks of this kind will be like when they are directed and\r\nsustained by the English Government itself.\r\n\r\nTheir hopes in regard to the Spanish possessions are heightened, and\r\ntheir projects are encouraged, by the general direction of the winds in\r\nthese seas. A happy experience has at length taught the English that the\r\nprevailing wind, that which blows strongest and most constantly, is the\r\nwest wind. Determined by these considerations (would you believe it,\r\nGeneral?) the English nowadays, instead of returning to Europe from Port\r\nJackson by traversing Bass Strait and doubling the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nturn their prows eastwards, abandon themselves to their favourite wind,\r\ntraverse rapidly the great expanse of the South Seas, double Cape Horn,\r\nand so do not reach England until they have made the circuit of the\r\nglobe! Consequently those voyages round the world, which were formerly\r\nconsidered so hazardous, and with which are associated so many\r\nillustrious names, have become quite familiar to English sailors. Even\r\ntheir fishing vessels accomplish the navigation of the globe just as\r\nsafely as they would make a voyage from Europe to the Antilles. That\r\ncircumstance is not so unimportant as may at first appear. The very idea\r\nof having circumnavigated the globe exalts the enthusiasm of English\r\nsailors. What navigation would not seem to them ordinary after voyages\r\nwhich carry with them great and terrible associations? Anyhow--and this\r\nis a most unfortunate circumstance for the Spaniards--it is indubitable\r\nthat the fact of the constancy of the west wind must facilitate\r\nextraordinarily projects of attack and invasion on the part of the\r\nEnglish, and everything sustains the belief that they will count for much\r\nin the general plan of the establishment in New Holland. Therefore the\r\nEnglish Government appears day by day to take more interest in the\r\ncolony. It redoubles sacrifices of all kinds. It endeavours in every way\r\nto increase the population as much as possible. Hardly a month passes but\r\nthere arrives some ship freighted by it, laden with provisions, goods,\r\nand above all with men and women, some transported people, who have to\r\nserve practically as slaves, others free immigrants, cultivators, to whom\r\nconcessions will be granted. Perhaps at first you will be astonished to\r\nlearn that honest men voluntarily transport themselves with their\r\nfamilies to the extremity of the world, to live in a country which is\r\nstill savage, and which was originally, and is still actually, occupied\r\nby brigands who have been thrust from the breast of society. But your\r\nastonishment will cease when you learn under what conditions such\r\nindividuals consent to exile themselves to these shores, and what\r\nadvantages they are not slow in deriving from a sacrifice which must\r\nalways be painful.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, before their departure from Europe, a sufficient sum\r\nis allowed to each individual to provide for the necessities of a long\r\nvoyage. On board the vessel which transports them to Sydney a price is\r\nfixed for the sustenance of the immigrant and his family, if he has any.\r\nUpon his landing at Port Jackson concessions are granted to him in\r\nproportion to the number of individuals comprised in his family. A number\r\nof convicts (that is the name they give the transported persons), in\r\nproportion to the extent of the concessions granted, are placed at his\r\ndisposal. A house is constructed for him; he is provided with all\r\nnecessary furniture and household utensils, and all the clothes he needs;\r\nthey grant him all the seed he needs to sow his land, all the tools he\r\nneeds to till it, and one or more pairs of all domestic animals and\r\nseveral kinds of poultry. Besides, they feed him, his family, and his\r\nassigned servants during eighteen months. He is completely sustained\r\nduring that period; and for the next twelve months half rations are\r\nallowed to him. At the end of that time the produce of his land is, with\r\nreason, expected to be sufficient for his requirements, and the\r\nGovernment leave him to his own resources.\r\n\r\nDuring five years he remains free of all contribution, accumulating the\r\nproduce of land all the more prolific because it is virgin. At the end of\r\nthat time a slight repayment is required by the Government. This\r\ngradually and slightly increases as time goes on. But mark here, General,\r\nthe profound wisdom of the English Government, that enlightened policy\r\nwhich guides all their enterprises and assures them success. If the new\r\nimmigrant during these five years has shown himself to be a diligent and\r\nintelligent cultivator; if his clearings have been well extended and his\r\nstock is managed with prudence; if the produce of his land has increased\r\nrapidly--then, so far from finding himself a debtor to the Government,\r\nhis holding is declared to be his own, and, as a recompense, fresh\r\nconcessions are made to him, additional servants are assigned to him, his\r\nimmunity from contributions is prolonged, and additional assistance of\r\nall sorts is extended to him. It is to these extensive and\r\nwell-considered sacrifices that it is necessary to attribute the fine\r\nfarms that daily increase in number in the midst of what was recently\r\nwild and uncultivated forest. Activity, intelligence and application\r\nconduce here more rapidly than elsewhere to fortune; and already several\r\nof the earlier immigrants have become very wealthy proprietors. Emulation\r\nof the noblest kind is stimulated everywhere. Experiments of all kinds\r\nare made and multiplied. The Government encourages them, and generously\r\nrecompenses those who have succeeded.\r\n\r\nWhat still further proves the particular interest which the English\r\nGovernment takes in the colony is the enormous expense incurred in\r\nprocuring commodities for the new colonists. Nearly everything is\r\nfurnished by the Government. Vast depots are filled with clothes and\r\nfabrics of all kinds and qualities, from the commonest to the finest. The\r\nsimplest furniture and household goods are to be found alongside the most\r\nelegant. Thus the inhabitants are able to buy, at prices below those\r\nruling in England,* everything necessary to not only the bare wants of\r\nlife, but also its comforts and pleasures. (* Note 29: This statement is\r\nsurprising, but probably true of part of the period when Peron was in\r\nSydney. There was then a glut of goods, as Bass found to his cost. He had\r\nto sell commodities brought out in the Venus at 50 per cent below their\r\nproper values.)\r\n\r\nAnxious to maintain the settlement on a firm and unshakeable basis, it is\r\nto agriculture, the source of the true wealth of nations, that the\r\nEnglish Government endeavours to direct the tastes of the inhabitants of\r\nthe new colony. Different kinds of cattle have been imported, and all\r\nthrive remarkably well. The better kinds, so far from losing quality,\r\ngain in size and weight. But the improvement in sheep is especially\r\nastonishing. Never was there a country so favourable to these animals as\r\nthe part of New Holland now occupied by the British. Whether it be the\r\neffect of the climate or, as I think, the peculiar quality of the herbage\r\n(almost wholly aromatic), certain it is that the flocks of sheep have\r\nmultiplied enormously. It is true that the finest breeds have been\r\nimported by the Government. At first, the choicest kinds of English and\r\nIrish sheep were naturalised. Then breeds from Bengal and the Cape of\r\nGood Hope were introduced. Finally, the good fortune which seems to have\r\nconspired with the enterprise of our rivals furnished them with several\r\npairs of merinos from Spain, which the Spanish Government at great\r\nexpense were sending to the Viceroy of Peru, upon a ship which was\r\ncaptured upon the coast of that country by an English vessel out of Port\r\nJackson, and which were brought thither, much to the satisfaction of the\r\nGovernor, who neglected nothing to derive the fullest possible advantage\r\nfrom a present valuable to the colony. His endeavours have not been in\r\nvain. This species, like the others, has improved much, and there is\r\nreason to believe that in a few years Port Jackson will be able to supply\r\nvaluable and abundant material for the manufacturers of England. What is\r\nmost astonishing is that the Indian sheep, which naturally produce short,\r\ncoarse hair instead of wool, in the course of three or four generations\r\nin this country produce a wool that can hardly be distinguished from that\r\nfurnished by English breeds, or even Spanish. I have seen at the\r\nGovernor's house an assortment of these different kinds of wool, which\r\nwere to be sent to Lord Sydney, and I assure you that it would be\r\ndifficult to find finer samples. In my excursions with Mr. Paterson, Mr.\r\nMarsden and Mr. Cox, I have seen their flocks, and really one could not\r\nbut admire in that regard the incalculable influence of the industry of\r\nman, so long as it is encouraged and stimulated by enlightened and just\r\nadministrators.\r\n\r\nAnother source of production which appears to offer great advantages to\r\nthe English is that of hemp. In this country it is as fine in quality as\r\nit is abundant, and several persons whose testimony is beyond suspicion\r\nhave assured me that New Holland, before many years have passed, will\r\nherself be able to furnish to the British Navy all the hemp that it\r\nrequires, thus freeing England from the considerable tribute that she\r\npays at present in that regard to the north of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe climate also appears to be favourable to the cultivation of the vine.\r\nIts latitude, little different from that of the Cape of Good Hope,\r\ncombined with its temperature, lead the Government to hope for great\r\nadvantages from the introduction of this plant to the continent of New\r\nHolland. Furthermore, French vignerons have been introduced at great\r\nexpense to promote this object. It is true that their first attempts have\r\nnot been very happy, but the lack of success is due entirely to the\r\nobstinacy of the English Governor, who, in spite of the representations\r\nof these men, compelled them to make their first plantations upon the\r\nside of a small, pleasant terrace forming a kind of semi-circle round\r\nGovernment House at Parramatta. This was, unfortunately, exposed to the\r\nnorth-west winds, burning winds like the mistral of Italy and Provence,\r\nthe khamsin of Egypt, etc. The French vignerons whom I had occasion to\r\nsee at Parramatta, in company with the Lieutenant-Governor, Mr. Paterson,\r\nassured me that they had found a piece of country very favourable to\r\ntheir new plantations, and that they hoped for the greatest success from\r\ntheir fresh efforts. Choice plants had been imported from Madeira and the\r\nCape.\r\n\r\nIn all the English establishments on these coasts traces of grand designs\r\nfor the future are evident. The mass of the people, being originally\r\ncomposed of the unfortunate and of wrong-doers, might have propagated\r\nimmorality and corruption, if the Government had not taken in good time\r\nmeans to prevent such a sad result. A house was founded in the early days\r\nof the settlement for the reception of young girls whose parents were too\r\npoor and too constrained in their circumstances at the commencement of\r\ntheir sojourn there to be able to devote much care to them; while if\r\nparents, when emancipated, so conduct themselves that their example or\r\ntheir course of life is likely to have an evil effect on their offspring,\r\nthe children are taken from them and placed in the home to which I have\r\nreferred. There they pursue regular studies; they are taught useful arts\r\nappropriate to their sex; they are instructed in reading, writing,\r\narithmetic, sewing, etc. Their teachers are chosen with much care, and\r\nthe wife of the Governor himself is charged with the supervision of that\r\nhonourable establishment, a supervision in which she is assisted by the\r\nwife of the commandant of the troops. Each or both of them visit every\r\nday their young family, as they themselves call it. They neglect nothing\r\nto ensure the maintenance of good conduct, the soundness of the education\r\nand the quality of the provisions. I have several times accompanied these\r\nadmirable ladies to the establishment, and have on every occasion been\r\nmoved by their anxious solicitude and their touching care.\r\n\r\nWhen these young girls arrive at marriageable age they are not abandoned\r\nby the Government. The following is the sagacious and commendable manner\r\nin which their establishment in life is provided for. Among the free\r\npersons who come to Port Jackson are many men who are not yet married.\r\nThe same is the case with some of those who by good conduct have earned\r\ntheir freedom. When one of those young men wishes to take a worthy wife,\r\nhe presents himself to the Governor's wife, who, after having obtained\r\ninformation concerning his character, permits him to visit her young\r\nflock. If he fixes his choice upon someone, he informs the Governor's\r\nwife, who, after consulting the tastes and inclinations of the young\r\nperson, accords or refuses her consent. When a marriage is arranged, the\r\nGovernment endows the young girl by means of concessions, assigned\r\nservants, etc.; and these unions have already become the nursery of a\r\nconsiderable number of good and happy homes. It is undoubtedly an\r\nadmirable policy, and one which has amply rewarded the English Government\r\nfor the sacrifices made to support it.\r\n\r\nThe defence of the country has not up to the present been very\r\nformidable, and has not needed to be, on account of the ignorance which\r\nprevails in Europe respecting the nature of this colony. The English\r\nGovernment is at the present moment directing men's minds towards\r\nagriculture. It has not, however, neglected to provide what the physical\r\ncondition of the land and the nature of its establishment demand. Two\r\nclasses of men are much to be feared at present: first, the criminals,\r\ncondemned for the most part to a long servitude, harshly treated,\r\ncompelled to the roughest and most fatiguing labour. That infamous class,\r\nthe vile refuse of civilised society, always ready to commit new crimes,\r\nneeds to be ceaselessly restrained by force and violence. The English\r\nGovernment therefore maintains a strong police. It is so efficient that\r\nin the midst of that infamous canaille the most perfect security reigns\r\neverywhere, and--what may appear paradoxical to those who do not know the\r\ndetails of the administration of the colony--fewer robberies are\r\ncommitted than in a European town of equal population. As to murder, I\r\nhave never heard tell of a crime of the kind being committed there, nor,\r\nindeed, did I hear of one occurring since the foundation of the colony.\r\nNevertheless, the first consideration entails the maintenance of a very\r\nconsiderable force; and with equal foresight and steadiness the\r\nGovernment has taken precautions against the efforts of these bandits. A\r\nsecond class of society, more formidable still (also much more\r\nrespectable, but having most to complain about, and the most interesting\r\nclass for us), is composed of legions of the unfortunate Irish, whom the\r\ndesire of freeing their country from the British yoke caused to arm in\r\nconcert with us against the English Government. Overwhelmed by force,\r\nthey were treated with pitiless rigour. Nearly all those who took up arms\r\nin our favour were mercilessly transported, and mixed with thieves and\r\nassassins. The first families of Ireland count their friends and\r\nrelations upon these coasts of New Holland. Persecuted by that most\r\nimplacable of all kinds of hatred, the hatred born of national animosity\r\nand differing convictions, they are cruelly treated, and all the more so\r\nbecause they are feared. Abandoned to themselves, it is felt, they can do\r\nnothing, and the Government gains several interesting advantages from\r\ntheir residence in this country. First, a population as numerous as it is\r\nvaliant is fixed upon these shores. Secondly, nearly all being condemned\r\nto a servitude more or less long, they provide many strong arms for the\r\nlaborious work of clearing. Thirdly, the mixing of so many brave men with\r\ncriminals seems to obliterate the character of the settlement and to\r\nprovide, by the retention of a crowd of honest men, some sort of a\r\ndefence against the opprobrium cast upon it. Fourthly, the Government has\r\nrelieved itself in Europe of a number of enraged and daring enemies. At\r\nthe same time, one must admit, this policy has its defects. The Irish,\r\nruled by a sceptre of iron, are quiet to-day. But if ever the Government\r\nof our country, alarmed by the rapidly increasing strength of this\r\ncolony, should formulate the project of taking or destroying it, at the\r\nmere mention of the French name every Irish arm would be raised. We had a\r\nvery striking example when we first arrived at Port Jackson. Upon the\r\nappearance of the French flag in the harbour the alarm in the country was\r\ngeneral. We were again at war with England. They regarded our second\r\nship,* (* Note 30: Le Naturaliste.) which had been separated from us and\r\ncompelled to seek shelter at Port Jackson, as a French ship of war. At\r\nthe name the Irish commenced to flock together. Everywhere they raised\r\ntheir bowed foreheads, bent under an iron rule; and, if their mistake had\r\nnot been so rapidly dispelled, a general rising would have taken place\r\namongst them. One or two were put to death on that occasion, and several\r\nwere deported to Norfolk Island. In any case, that formidable portion of\r\nthe population will always compel the English to maintain many troops\r\nupon this continent, until, at all events, time and inter-marriage shall\r\nhave cicatrized the recent wounds of the poor Irish and softened their\r\nresentment.\r\n\r\nThe Government, however, appears to feel that considerably larger forces\r\nare required than are now available. At the time of our departure the\r\nregiment forming the garrison at Port Jackson did not number more than\r\n800. But some were being continually removed to India, and to replace\r\nthem 5000 men were expected. The news of the war must have led to the\r\nchanging of these dispositions, because the troops, which were to have\r\nbeen transported on warships, were drawn from Europe, and probably the\r\nEnglish Government will have been careful not to despatch so considerable\r\na force to New Holland in the critical situation in which it now finds\r\nitself. Moreover, General, do not believe that so many troops are\r\nindispensable to the security of the coasts of New Holland, but rather\r\nconsider the advantages that the English nation is likely to draw from\r\nits establishments in that part of the world. The climate of India,\r\ninimical to newcomers from Europe, is still more so to these British\r\nregiments, drawn from the frosty counties of the north of England and\r\nfrom the icy realms of Scotland. A considerable loss of men results from\r\ntheir almost immediate transportation to the burning plains of India.\r\nForced to look after a population which has little affinity with its\r\nimmense possessions in both hemispheres, England has always set an\r\nexample of great sacrifices for all that can tend to the conservation of\r\nthe health of its people. The new colony of Port Jackson will serve in\r\nthe future as a depot for troops destined for India. Actually the whole\r\nof the territory occupied up to the present is extremely salubrious. Not\r\na single malady endemic to the country has yet been experienced. The\r\nwhole population enjoys the best of health. The children especially are\r\nhandsome and vigorous, though the temperature at certain times is very\r\nhigh. We ourselves experienced towards the close of our visit very hot\r\nweather, though we were there in the months of Fructidor, Vendemiaire and\r\nBrumaire* (* Note 31: From Fructidor to Brumaire would be from September\r\n22nd to December 20th.) nearly corresponding to our European spring. The\r\ntemperature of New Holland, rather more than a mean between those of\r\nEngland and India, ought to be valuable in preparing for the latter\r\ncountry that large body of soldiers which the Government despatches every\r\nyear to Bengal, the Coromandel coast, Malabar, etc., etc. Consequently\r\nthe loss of men will be much less, and you will easily realise the\r\nadvantage that will accrue to a power like England, when it contemplates\r\nthe invasion, with a mediocre population, of archipelagos, islands, and\r\neven continents.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This portion of New Holland appears to owe its salubriousness:--\r\n\r\n(1) To a situation resembling that of the Cape of Good Hope (Port Jackson\r\nis in about latitude 34 degrees).\r\n\r\n(2) To the nature of the soil, which is very dry, especially round\r\nSydney;\r\n\r\n(3) To the nature of the vegetation, which is not vigorous enough to\r\nmaintain a noxious stagnation in the lower strata of the atmosphere;\r\n\r\n(4) To the great, or rather enormous, quantity of aromatic plants which\r\nconstitute the principal part of the vegetation, including even the\r\nlargest species;\r\n\r\n(5) To the vicinity of the Blue Mountains, the elevation of which\r\ncontributes largely to maintain a certain salutary freshness in the\r\natmosphere;\r\n\r\n(6) To the remarkable constancy of the light fresh breezes which blow\r\nfrom the south-east towards the middle of the day.\r\n\r\nI have not yet finished the account of the important advantages that\r\nEngland draws from this colony. If time were not so pressing and if I had\r\nat my disposal the abundant material consigned to our Government, I could\r\nwrite more. I venture to sum up those considerations to which I have\r\nreferred, in a form which will be useful for determining your opinion\r\nupon this important and rising colony.\r\n\r\n(1) By means of it England founds an empire which will extend over the\r\ncontinent of New Holland, Van Diemen's Land, all the islands of Bass\r\nStrait, New Zealand, and the numerous archipelagos of the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\n(2) She thereby becomes the mistress of a large number of superb ports,\r\nseveral of which can be compared with advantage to the most fortunately\r\nsituated harbours in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\n(3) She thereby excludes her rivals, and, so to speak, blocks all the\r\nnations of Europe from entry to the Pacific.\r\n\r\n(4) Having become the neighbour of Peru and Chili, she casts towards\r\nthose countries hopes increasingly assured and greedy.\r\n\r\n(5) Her privateers and her fleets in time of war will be able to\r\ndevastate the coasts of South America; and, if in the last war she\r\nattempted no such enterprise, the reason appears to be that her astute\r\npolicy made her fear to do too much to open the eyes of Spain, and even\r\nof all Europe.\r\n\r\n(6) In time of peace, by means of an active contraband trade, she\r\nprepares redoubtable enemies for the Spaniards; she furnishes arms and\r\nammunition of all kinds to that horde of untamed people who have not yet\r\nbeen subjugated to the European yoke.\r\n\r\n(7) By the same means she enables the products of her manufacturers to\r\ninundate South America, which is shabbily and above all expensively\r\nsupplied by Spain.\r\n\r\n(8) If amongst the numerous archipelagos that are visited constantly some\r\nformidable military position is found, England will occupy it and,\r\nbecoming a nearer neighbour to the rich Spanish possessions, will menace\r\nthem more closely, more certainly, and above all more impatiently. Mr.\r\nFlinders, in an expedition of discovery which is calculated to last five\r\nyears, and who doubtless at the present moment is traversing the region\r\nunder discussion, appears to have that object particularly in view.* (*\r\nNote 32: \"M. Flinders, dans une expedition de decouverte qui doit durer\r\ncinq ans, et qui sans doute parcourt en ce moment le theatre qui nous\r\noccupe, paroit avoir plus particulierement cette objet en vue.\" The\r\npassage is peculiarly interesting. At the time when Peron was writing,\r\nearly in December, 1803, Flinders was, as a matter of fact, sailing\r\ntowards Ile-de-France in the Cumberland.)\r\n\r\n(9) The extraordinarily lucrative whale fishery of New Zealand is\r\nEXCLUSIVELY* (* Note 33: Underlined in original.) assured to them. No\r\nEuropean nation can henceforth, according to the general opinion, compete\r\nwith them for that object.\r\n\r\n(10) The fishery, no less lucrative, of the enormous seals which cover\r\nthe shores of several of the islands of Bass Strait, and from which is\r\ndrawn an oil infinitely superior to whale oil, guarantees them yet\r\nanother source of greatness and of wealth. Note: the seals in question,\r\ndistinguished by the English under the name of sea elephants, are\r\nsometimes 25 or 30 feet long. They attain the bulk of a large cask: and\r\nthe enormous mass of the animal seems, so to say, to be composed of\r\nsolid, or rather coagulated, oil. The quantity extracted from one seal is\r\nprodigious. I have collected many particulars on this subject.\r\n\r\n(11) A third fishery, even more lucrative and important, is that of the\r\nskins of various varieties of seal which inhabit most of the islands of\r\nBass Strait, all the Furneaux Islands, all the islands off the eastern\r\ncoast of Van Diemen's Land, and all those on the south-west coast of New\r\nHolland, and which probably will be found upon the archipelagos of the\r\neastern portion of this vast continent. The skins of these various\r\nspecies of seal are much desired in China. The sale of a shipload of\r\nthese goods in that country is as rapid as it is lucrative. The ships\r\nengaged in the business are laden on their return to Europe with that\r\nprecious merchandise of China which gold alone can extract from the\r\nclutch of its rapacious possessors. Accordingly, one of the most\r\nimportant objects of the mission of Lord Macartney* to China, (* Note 34:\r\nLord Macartney's embassy to China, 1792 to 1794, was, says the Cambridge\r\nModern History (2 718), \"productive only of a somewhat better\r\nacquaintance between the two Powers and an increased knowledge on the\r\npart of British sailors of the navigation of Chinese waters.\") that of\r\ndeveloping in that country a demand for some of the economic and\r\nmanufacturing products of England, so as to relieve that country of the\r\nnecessity of sending out such a mass of specie--that interesting object\r\nwhich all the ostentatious display of the commercial wealth of Europe had\r\nnot been able to attain, and all the astute diplomacy of Lord Macartney\r\nhad failed to achieve--the English have recently accomplished. Masters of\r\nthe trade in these kinds of skin, they are about to become masters of the\r\nChina trade. The coin accumulated in the coffers of the Government or of\r\nprivate people will no longer be sunk in the provinces of China. That\r\nadvantage is incontestably one of the greatest that they have derived\r\nfrom their establishment at Port Jackson.\r\n\r\n(12) This augmentation of distant possessions is likely to occasion a\r\nfresh development in the British Navy. The practice of voyaging round the\r\nworld should exalt the enthusiasm of their sailors, whilst it increases\r\ntheir number and efficiency. I may add here that to attain the\r\nlast-mentioned end the English Government compels each ship which sails\r\nfor these regions, and above all for New Zealand, to carry a certain\r\nnumber of young men below 19 years of age, who return from these voyages\r\nonly after having obtained a very valuable endowment of experience.\r\n\r\n(13) The temperature and salubriousness of the country will enable it to\r\nlook after a very large number of soldiers who used to be incapacitated\r\nevery year by the burning heat of Asia.\r\n\r\n(14) The abundance of the flocks, and the superiority of their wool, will\r\nfurnish an immense quantity of excellent material to the national\r\nmanufactures, already superior to those of the rest of Europe.\r\n\r\n(15) The cultivation of hemp and vines gives cause to the English to hope\r\nthat before very long they will be freed from the large tribute which\r\nthey now pay for the first-named to all the Powers of the north of\r\nEurope, and for the second to Portugal, France and Spain.\r\n\r\n(16) I will not discuss with you some substances indigenous to the\r\ncountry which are already in use, whether in medicine, or in the arts--of\r\neucalyptus gum, for example, which is at once astringent and tonic to a\r\nvery high degree, and is likely soon to become one of our most energetic\r\ndrugs. Nor will I say much about the resin furnished by the tree which\r\nthe English mis-name gourmier,* (* Note 35: Peron's word.) a resin which\r\nby reason of its hardness may become of very great value in the arts. It\r\nwill be sufficient to say, General, that I possess a native axe obtained\r\nfrom the aboriginals of King George's Sound. It is nothing better than a\r\nchip of very hard granite fastened to the end of a piece of wood, which\r\nserves as a handle, by means of the resin to which I have referred. I\r\nhave shown it to several persons. It will rapidly split a wooden plank\r\nand one can strike with all one's force, without in the least degree\r\ninjuring the resin. Though the edge of the stone has several times been\r\nchipped, the resin always remained intact. I will say little of the fine\r\nand abundant timber furnished by what is called the casuarina tree, and\r\nby what the English improperly call the pear. This pear is what the\r\nbotanists term Xylomelum, and by reason of its extremely beautiful and\r\ndeep grain, and the fine polish which it is susceptible of receiving, it\r\nappears to be superior to some of the best known woods. I will not refer\r\nat length to the famous flax of New Zealand, which may become the subject\r\nof a large trade when its preparation is made easier; nor to cotton,\r\nwhich is being naturalised; nor to coffee, of which I myself have seen\r\nthe first plantations, etc., etc. All these commodities are secondary in\r\nimportance in comparison with others to which I have referred; yet,\r\nconsidered together, they will add greatly to the importance of this new\r\ncolony. Similarly, I will pass over the diverse products which are sure\r\nto be furnished by the prolific archipelagos, and of which several are\r\nlikely to become of great value and to fetch high prices for use in the\r\narts and in medicine. For example, the cargo of the last vessel that\r\narrived in Port Jackson from the Navigator Islands, during our stay,\r\nconsisted partly of cordage of different degrees of thickness, made from\r\na plant peculiar to those islands, the nature of which is such that, we\r\nwere assured, it is almost indestructible by water and the humidity of\r\nthe atmosphere; whilst its toughness makes it superior to ordinary\r\ncordage.\r\n\r\n(17) The English hope for much from mineral discoveries. Those parts of\r\nthe country lying nearest to the sea, which are of a sandstone or slaty\r\nformation, appear to contain only deposits of excellent coal; but the\r\nentire range of the Blue Mountains has not yet been explored for\r\nminerals. The colony had not up to the time of our visit a mineralogist\r\nin its service, but the Governor hoped soon to obtain the services of\r\none, to commence making investigations; and the nature of the country,\r\ncombined with its extent, affords ground for strong hope in that regard.\r\n\r\n(18) There are, finally, other advantages, apparently less interesting,\r\nbut which do not fail to exert an influence upon the character and\r\nprestige of a nation. I refer to the conspicuous glory which geographical\r\ndiscoveries necessarily following upon such an establishment as this\r\nbring upon a nation's name; to all that which accrues to a people from\r\nthe discovery and collection of so many new and valuable things; to the\r\ndistinguished services which new countries call forth and which confer so\r\nmuch distinction upon those who watch over their birth.\r\n\r\nTime does not permit me to pursue the enquiry. I wish only to add here\r\none fresh proof of the importance which England attaches to this new\r\ncolony. When we left Port Jackson, the authorities were awaiting the\r\narrival of five or six large vessels laden with the goods of English\r\npersons formerly domiciled at the Cape of Good Hope, whom the surrender\r\nof that possession to the Dutch had compelled to leave.* (* Note 36: The\r\nCape was surrendered to Holland in 1803, but British rule was restored\r\nthere in 1806.) That very great accession of population ought\r\nsufficiently to indicate to you how great are the projects of the British\r\nMinistry in that region.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding I should have liked to point out the impossibility, for\r\nFrance, of retarding the rapid progress of the establishment at Port\r\nJackson, or of entering into competition with its settlers in the trade\r\nin sealskins, the whale fishery, etc. But it would take rather too long\r\nto discuss that matter. I think I ought to confine myself to telling you\r\nthat my opinion, and that of all those among us who have more\r\nparticularly occupied themselves with enquiring into the organization of\r\nthat colony, is that it should be destroyed as soon as possible.* (* Note\r\n37: Mon sentiment et celui de tous ceux d'entre nous qui se sont plus\r\nparticulierement occupes de l'organisation de cette colonie seroit de la\r\ndetruire le plus tot possible.\") To-day we could destroy it easily; we\r\nshall not be able to do so in 25 years' time.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be, with respectful devotion,\r\n\r\nYour very humble servant,\r\n\r\nPERON.\r\n\r\nP.S. M. Freycinet, the young officer, has especially concerned himself\r\nwith examining all the points upon the coast of the environs of Port\r\nJackson which are favourable to the landing of troops. He has collected\r\nparticular information concerning the entrance to the port; and, if ever\r\nthe Government should think of putting into execution the project of\r\ndestroying this freshly-set trap of a great Power,* that distinguished\r\nofficer would be of valuable assistance in such an operation. (* Note 38:\r\n\"Le projet de detruire ce piege naissant d'une grande puissance.\" )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C.
