To them I have the privilege of adding in the present volume\r\nan authoritative narrative of the events that followed the execution\r\nof the Taeping Wangs at Soochow, and of thus rendering tardy justice\r\nto the part taken in them by Sir Halliday Macartney. Among the\r\ncontents of the large portmanteau in which all these documents were\r\nstored, I noticed a thick bundle of letters, in somewhat faded\r\nhandwriting, and an examination of their contents showed me that they\r\nwere of the deepest interest as relating to the important events of\r\nthe Crimean War, and to the first seven years of Gordon's service in\r\nthe Army. I at once went to Sir Henry Gordon, who honoured me with his\r\nfriendship and confidence in no less a degree than his distinguished\r\nand ever-lamented brother, and begged of him permission to publish\r\nthem. He at once gave his consent, which was ratified by the late Miss\r\nAugusta Gordon, the hero's favourite sister. The letters appeared in\r\nJuly 1884, under the title of \"General Gordon's Letters from the\r\nCrimea, the Danube, and Armenia.\" In the proper place I have told what\r\nKinglake, the historian of the war, thought of them and their author.\r\n\r\nIn the rush of books that followed the fall of Khartoum, no favourable\r\nopportunity for carrying out my original purpose presented itself;\r\nand, indeed, I may say that the anonymous biographical work I\r\nperformed during the course of the year 1885 would have filled a\r\nlarge-sized volume. Moreover, the terrible events of the fall of\r\nKhartoum, and the failure of the relieving expedition, were too close\r\nat hand to allow of a just view being taken of them, and it was\r\nnecessary to defer an intention which I never abandoned. It seemed to\r\nme that the tenth anniversary of the fall of Khartoum would be an\r\nappropriate occasion for the appearance of a Life claiming to give a\r\ncomplete view and final verdict on the remarkable career and character\r\nof the man, with whom his own friendly inclination had made me\r\nexceptionally well acquainted.\r\n\r\nIn 1893, therefore, I began to take steps to carry out my project, and\r\nto the notification of my intention and the application for assistance\r\nin regard to unpublished papers, I received from several of the\r\nprincipal representatives of the Gordon family encouraging replies.\r\nBut at this time both Sir Henry Gordon and Miss Gordon were dead, and\r\nI discovered that the latter had bound her literary executrix, Miss\r\nDunlop, a niece of General Gordon's, by a promise not to divulge the\r\nbulk of the unpublished papers during her lifetime. I am happy to\r\nsay, however, that Miss Dunlop, without accepting any responsibility\r\nfor what I have written, has with the greatest possible kindness read\r\nthese pages, and assisted me to attain complete accuracy in the facts,\r\nso far as they relate to family and personal matters, but excluding\r\naltogether from her purview all military and political topics. For\r\nthat co-operation, unfortunately restricted by the condition of the\r\npromise to Miss Gordon, I avail myself of this opportunity to express\r\nmy grateful thanks; and I am also indebted to Miss Dunlop for the\r\nyouthful unpublished portrait of Gordon which forms the frontispiece\r\nof this volume, and also for that of the house in which he was born.\r\n\r\nWhen I was first confronted with the difficulty that the unpublished\r\npapers would not be accessible to me, I contemplated the abandonment\r\nof my task; but a brief consideration made me conclude that, even\r\nwithout these documents, I had special knowledge, derived from Sir\r\nHenry Gordon and many other sources, that would enable me to deal with\r\nall the more important passages of General Gordon's life. The result\r\nmust be judged from the Life itself; but I have not sought to make any\r\npartisan attack on anyone, although, when I have felt compelled to\r\ncriticise and censure, I have done so with a full sense of\r\nresponsibility as well as with reluctance. I may be pardoned the\r\nconfidence I express when I say that I am sure nothing in the\r\nunpublished documents will affect the main conclusions to which I have\r\ncome on the Khartoum mission, its inception and disastrous close.\r\n\r\nI am permitted by the courtesy of the proprietors of _The Times_ to\r\nreproduce in these pages the several articles and letters which\r\noriginally appeared in the columns of that paper.\r\n\r\nIt is a personal matter, of no interest except to myself, but I should\r\nlike to state that the work would have been out much sooner but for a\r\nlong and serious illness.\r\n\r\n                                   DEMETRIUS C.

The picture given elsewhere of\r\nthis house will specially interest the reader as the birthplace of\r\nGordon. It still stands, as described by Gordon's father in a private\r\nmemoir, at the corner of Jackson's Lane, on Woolwich Common.\r\n\r\nThe name \"Gordon\" has baffled the etymologists, for there is every\r\nreason to believe that the not inappropriate connection with the\r\nDanish word for a spear is due to a felicitous fancy rather than to\r\nany substantial reality. There is far more justification for the\r\nopinion that the name comes through a French source than from a\r\nDanish. The Gorduni were a leading clan of Caesar's most formidable\r\nopponents, the Nervi; a Duke Gordon charged among the peers of\r\nCharlemagne; and the name is not unknown at the present day in the\r\nTyrol. The \"Gordium\" of Phrygia and the \"Gordonia\" of Macedonia are\r\nalso names that suggest an Eastern rather than a Northern origin.\r\nHistory strengthens this supposition and entirely disposes of the\r\nDanish hypothesis. The first bearer of the name Gordon appeared in\r\nScotland at far too near a date to the Danish descents upon that\r\ncountry to encourage the view that he was a member of that most\r\nbitterly hated race. Nowhere were the Danes more hated or less\r\nsuccessful than in Scotland, yet we are asked to believe that the\r\nfounder of one of the most powerful families in that kingdom belonged\r\nto this alien and detested people. The silence itself of the\r\nchronicler sufficiently refutes the idea that the first Gordon was a\r\nrenegade or a traitor, as he must have been if he were a Dane.\r\n\r\nIn all probability the first Gordon, who helped Malcolm Canmore, and\r\nreceived in return a large grant of lands in Berwick, which became\r\nknown as the Gordon country, was one of the many Norman knights\r\nattracted to the Court of Edward the Confessor. Accepting for the\r\noccasion the popular legendary version of Shakespeare, rather than the\r\ncorrected account of modern historians, he may be supposed to have\r\nfound his way north to the camp of Siward, where the youthful and\r\nexiled Scotch Prince had sought shelter from Macbeth, and it is no\r\nundue stretch of fancy to suggest that he took his part in the\r\nmemorable overthrow of that usurper at Dunsinane, and thus obtained\r\nthe favour of his successor. The growth of the Gordon family in place\r\nand power was rapid. To the lands on the borders was soon added the\r\nHuntly country on Deeside, where Aboyne Castle now stands, and in a\r\nvery short period the Gordons ranked among the most powerful and\r\nwarlike clans of Scotland. As Sir Walter Scott wrote of Adam Gordon,\r\nin words which might be appropriately applied to the subject of this\r\nbiography:\r\n\r\n  \"'Tis a name which ne'er hath been dishonour'd,\r\n  And never will, I trust--most surely never\r\n  By such a youth as thou!\"\r\n\r\nBe its remote origin what it may, no name has appeared more\r\nprominently or more honourably in the British Army Lists during the\r\nlast century and a half than that of Gordon. One of the most famous of\r\nour regiments bears and has nobly upheld the name. In honourable and\r\nfriendly rivalry with the equally numerous and equally distinguished\r\nclans of Grant and Cameron, the Gordons have figured on every\r\nbattlefield from Minden to Candahar, thus establishing at the same\r\ntime the political wisdom of Chatham, who first turned the Highlanders\r\nfrom a cause of danger into a source of strength, and the military\r\nardour and genius of their own race. Thus it came to pass that the\r\nspirit of remote warlike ages was perpetuated, and that the profession\r\nof arms continued to be the most natural one for any bearer of the\r\nname Gordon. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that the\r\npractice of his nearest relations, as well as the traditions of his\r\nrace, marked out Charles Gordon for a soldier's career.\r\n\r\nPassing over an uncertain connection with the General Peter Gordon,\r\nwho rose high in the Russian service under Peter the Great, the\r\nnearest direct ancestor of whom we can speak with absolute confidence\r\nwas Charles Gordon's great-grandfather David Gordon, who served as a\r\nlieutenant in Lascelles' regiment of foot--afterwards the 47th\r\nRegiment--at the battle of Prestonpans. Although the majority of the\r\nclans were still loyal to the Stuarts, it seems from this that some of\r\nthem had entered the Hanoverian service probably in that most\r\ndistinguished regiment, the First Royal Scots, which a few years\r\nbefore Culloden had fought gallantly at Fontenoy. At Prestonpans David\r\nGordon had the bad fortune to be made prisoner by the forces of\r\nCharles Edward, and he found on the victorious side the whole of the\r\nGordon clan, under the command of Sir William Gordon of Park, a\r\nyounger son of the Earl of Huntly. As he was able to claim kindred\r\nwith Sir William, David Gordon received better treatment than he might\r\nhave expected, and in a short time was allowed to go free, either on\r\nan exchange of prisoners or more probably on his parole. This incident\r\nis specially interesting, because, after making every allowance for\r\nthe remoteness and vagueness of the old Highland custom of cousinship,\r\nit seems to bring Charles Gordon's ancestry into sufficiently close\r\nrelationship with the main Gordon stem of the Huntlys. After his\r\nrelease David Gordon does not appear to have taken any further part in\r\nthe war which terminated at Culloden, and he emigrated shortly\r\nafterwards to North America, where his death is recorded as having\r\ntaken place at a comparatively early age at Halifax in the year 1752.\r\n\r\nThat he came of gentle blood is also proved by the fact that the Duke\r\nof Cumberland stood sponsor to his son, who bore the Duke's names of\r\nWilliam Augustus. This second Gordon, of the particular branch that\r\nhas interest for us, also entered the army, and held a commission in\r\nseveral regiments. The most memorable event in his life was his taking\r\npart in Wolfe's decisive victory on the heights of Abraham. In 1773 he\r\nmarried a lady, Miss Anna Maria Clarke, whose brother was rector of\r\nHexham in Northumberland, and by her had a family of four daughters\r\nand three sons. Of the latter, two died at an early age, and only the\r\nyoungest, William Henry, born in 1786, survived to manhood. He is\r\nespecially interesting to us, because he was the father of General\r\nGordon.\r\n\r\nLike his father and grandfather, William Henry Gordon chose the\r\nprofession of a soldier, and entered the Royal Artillery. He saw a\r\ngreat deal of active service, being with his corps in the Peninsula\r\nand at Maida, commanding at a later period the Artillery at Corfu and\r\nGibraltar, and attaining before his death in 1865 the rank of\r\nLieutenant-General. He was also connected with the Woolwich Arsenal as\r\nDirector of the Carriage Department. He has been described as an\r\nexcellent officer if a somewhat strict disciplinarian, and his firm\r\ncharacter of noble integrity lived again in his sons. He married, in\r\n1817, Elizabeth, the daughter of Samuel Enderby, a merchant whaler,\r\none of those west country worthies who carried on the traditions of\r\nElizabeth to the age of Victoria. It would not be possible to present\r\na complete picture of Gordon's mother, and therefore none will be\r\nattempted here; but all the available evidence agrees in describing\r\nher as a paragon of women, and as having exercised an exceptional\r\ninfluence over her children. Gordon himself bore the most expressive\r\ntestimony to her virtues and memory when, long years afterwards, he\r\nclosed an exordium on the filial affection due to a mother with the\r\noutburst--\"Oh! how my mother loved me!\"\r\n\r\nSuch in brief were the forebears of the hero who comes next after\r\nNelson in national veneration. To understand him and his career, it\r\nmust be remembered that he came of a gallant race, with a quick sense\r\nof honour, seeing clearly the obvious course of duty, and never\r\nhesitating in its fulfilment. These qualities were not peculiar to the\r\nman, but inherited from his race, and as they had never been\r\ncontaminated by the pursuit of wealth in any form, they retained the\r\npristine vigour and fire of a chivalrous and noble age. What was\r\npersonal and peculiar to Charles Gordon had to be evolved by\r\ncircumstance and the important occurrences with which it was his lot\r\nto be associated throughout his military and public career, but his\r\nsoldierly talent and virtue must be mainly assigned to the traditions\r\nand practice of his ancestors.\r\n\r\nOf the five sons of General William Henry Gordon and Elizabeth\r\nEnderby, Charles George Gordon was the fourth. His eldest brother,\r\nHenry William Gordon, born in 1818, had entered the army, first in the\r\n8th Regiment, and transferred in a short time to the 59th, when, at\r\nthe early age of ten, Charles Gordon was sent off to school at\r\nTaunton. The selection of this school in the western country was due\r\nto the head-master, Mr Rogers, being a brother of a governess in the\r\nGordon family. Little is known of his early childhood beyond the fact\r\nthat he had lived, before he was ten, at Corfu, where his father held\r\na command for some years. The Duke of Cambridge has publicly stated\r\nthat he recollects, when quartered at Corfu at this period, having\r\nseen a bright and intelligent boy who occupied the room next to his\r\nown, and who subsequently became General Gordon. At Taunton Gordon\r\nremained during the greater part of five years, enjoying the\r\nadvantages of one of the most excellent grammar schools in the West of\r\nEngland, and although he failed to make any special mark as a scholar,\r\nI find that, whether on account of his later fame or for some special\r\ncharacteristic that marked him out from the general run of boys, his\r\nname is still remembered there by something more than the initials cut\r\nupon his desk. If he distinguished himself in anything it was in\r\nmap-making and drawing, and he exhibited the same qualifications to\r\nthe end of his career. How careful and excellent the grounding at\r\nTaunton school must have been was shown by the fact that, after one\r\nyear's special coaching at Mr Jefferies' school at Shooter's Hill,\r\nGordon passed direct into the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. It\r\nis noteworthy that during the whole of the period we are now\r\napproaching, he never showed the least tendency to extravagance, and\r\nhis main anxiety seems to have been to save his parents all possible\r\nexpense, more especially because they had a large family of daughters.\r\nTo the end of his life, and in each successive post, Gordon was the\r\nslave of duty. At this time, and during the years that follow, down to\r\nthe Chinese campaigns, his guiding thought was how to save his family\r\nthe smallest expense on his account, and yet at the same time to hold\r\nhis head high, and to show himself worthy of his race.\r\n\r\nGordon entered the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich in 1848, when he\r\nhad not completed his sixteenth year, and during the four years he\r\nremained there he gave some evidence of the qualities that\r\nsubsequently distinguished him, at the same time that he showed a\r\nlightness of disposition which many will think at strange variance\r\nwith the gravity and even solemnity of his later years. Among his\r\nfellow-students he was not distinguished by any special or exclusive\r\ndevotion to study. He was certainly no bookworm, and he was known\r\nrather for his love of sport and boisterous high spirits than for\r\nattention to his lessons or for a high place in his class. More than\r\nonce he was involved in affairs that, if excusable and natural on the\r\nscore of youth, trenched beyond the borders of discipline, and the\r\nstories of life at the Academy that he recited for many years after he\r\nleft were not exactly in harmony with the popular idea of the ascetic\r\nof Mount Carmel.\r\n\r\nAs the reader treasures up the boyish escapades of Nelson and Clive,\r\nso will enduring interest be felt in those outbreaks of the boy\r\nGordon, which made him the terror of his superiors. They are recorded\r\non the unimpeachable evidence of his elder brother, and some of them\r\nwere even narrated by Gordon himself to his niece nearly thirty years\r\nafter they happened. Sir Henry is the writer.\r\n\r\n     \"Charles Gordon with a brother (William Augustus) more unruly\r\n     than himself, finding the time hang heavily upon their hands\r\n     during the vacation, employed themselves in various ways. Their\r\n     father's house (at Woolwich) was opposite to that of the\r\n     Commandant of the Garrison, and was overrun with mice. These were\r\n     caught, the Commandant's door quietly opened, and the mice were\r\n     transferred to new quarters. In after life (that is in 1879, when\r\n     in the Soudan) Charles Gordon wrote to one of his nieces: 'I am\r\n     glad to hear the race of true Gordons is not extinct. Do you not\r\n     regret the Arsenal and its delights? You never, any of you, made\r\n     a proper use of the Arsenal workmen as we did. They used to\r\n     neglect their work for our orders, and turned out some splendid\r\n     squirts--articles that would wet you through in a minute. As for\r\n     the crossbows we had made, they were grand with screws. One\r\n     Sunday afternoon twenty-seven panes of glass were broken in the\r\n     large storehouses. They were found to have been perforated with a\r\n     small hole (ventilation), and Captain Soady nearly escaped a\r\n     premature death; a screw passed his head, and was as if it had\r\n     been screwed into the wall which it had entered. Servants were\r\n     kept at the door with continual bell-ringings. Your uncle Freddy\r\n     (a younger brother) was pushed into houses, the bell rung, and\r\n     the door held to prevent escape. Those were the days of the\r\n     Arsenal.'\"\r\n\r\nSir Henry continues:\r\n\r\n     \"But what Charles Gordon considered as his greatest achievement\r\n     was one that he in after years often alluded to. At this time\r\n     (1848) the senior class of Cadets, then called the Practical\r\n     Class, were located in the Royal Arsenal, and in front of their\r\n     halls of study there were earthworks upon which they were\r\n     practised from time to time in profiling and other matters. The\r\n     ins and outs of these works were thoroughly well known to Charles\r\n     Gordon and his brother, who stole out at night--but we will leave\r\n     him to tell his own story. He says: 'I forgot to tell----of how\r\n     when Colonel John Travers of the Hill Folk (he lived on Shooter's\r\n     Hill) was lecturing to the Arsenal Cadets in the evening, a crash\r\n     was heard, and every one thought every pane of glass was broken;\r\n     small shot had been thrown. However, it was a very serious\r\n     affair, for like the upsetting of a hive, the Cadets came out,\r\n     and only darkness, speed, and knowledge of the fieldworks thrown\r\n     up near the lecture-room enabled us to escape. That was before I\r\n     entered the curriculum. The culprits were known afterwards, and\r\n     for some time avoided the vicinity of the Cadets. I remember it\r\n     with horror to this day, for no mercy would have been shown by\r\n     the Pussies, as the Cadets were called.'\"\r\n\r\nAfter he entered the Academy the same love of fun and practical joking\r\ncharacterised him. Sir Henry writes: \"After he had been some time at\r\nthe Academy and earned many good-conduct badges, an occasion arose\r\nwhen it became necessary to restrain the Cadets in leaving the\r\ndining-hall, the approach to which was by a narrow staircase. At the\r\ntop of this staircase stood the senior corporal, with outstretched\r\narms, facing the body of Cadets. This was too much for Charlie Gordon,\r\nwho, putting his head down, butted with it, and catching the officer\r\nin the pit of the stomach not only sent him down the stairs, but\r\nthrough the glass door beyond. The officer jumped up unhurt, and\r\nGordon was placed in confinement and nearly dismissed.\r\n\r\n\"Upon another occasion, when he was near his commission, a great deal\r\nof bullying was going on, and in order to repress it a number of the\r\nlast comers were questioned, when one of them said that Charlie Gordon\r\nhad on one occasion hit him on the head with a clothesbrush. The lad\r\nadmitted it was not a severe blow; nevertheless Charlie Gordon was for\r\nthis slight offence put back six months for his commission, which\r\nturned out well in the end, since it secured for him a second\r\nlieutenancy in the Royal Engineers in place of the Royal Artillery.\"\r\nThis alteration in the branch of the service to which he was attached\r\nwas due to his own act. He decided that, as his contemporaries would\r\nbe put ahead of him, he would work for the Engineers instead of the\r\nArtillery.\r\n\r\nEven to the end of his life there were two sides to his character.\r\nPrivate grief, much disappointment, and a long solitary existence,\r\ncontributed to make him a melancholy philosopher, and a sometimes\r\naustere critic of a selfish world, but beneath this crust were a\r\ngenial and generous disposition that did not disdain the lighter side\r\nof human nature, a heart too full of kindness to cherish wrath for\r\nlong, and an almost boyish love of fun that could scarcely be\r\nrepressed. If this was the individual in his quieter and contemplative\r\nmoods, an energy that never tired, and a warlike spirit that only\r\nneeded the occasion to blaze forth, revealed the man of action. It may\r\nbe pronounced a paradox to say so, but to the end of his life the true\r\nGordon was more of the soldier than the saint.\r\n\r\nEven in the midst of his escapades at the Academy, something of the\r\nspirit of the future hero revealed itself. However grave the offence\r\nor heavy the punishment, he was never backward in taking his share--or\r\nmore than his share--of the blame for any scrape into which he and his\r\nfriends were brought by their excessive high spirits. On more than one\r\noccasion his ardour and sense of justice resulted in his being made\r\nthe scapegoat of worse offenders, and it seems probable that he\r\ngenerally bore more than his proper share of the blame and punishment\r\nfor acts of insubordination. But there were limits to his capacity of\r\nsuffering and sense of guilt, and when one of his superiors declared\r\nthat he \"would never make an officer,\" he touched a point of honour,\r\nand Gordon's vigorous and expressive reply was to tear the epaulettes\r\nfrom his shoulder and throw them at his superior's feet. In this\r\nincident the reader will not fail to see a touch and forecast of\r\ngreatness. He was ever willing to pay the penalty of youthful\r\nindiscretion, but he was sensitive to the reproach of honour, and his\r\nexuberant spirits detracted in no respect from his sense of the\r\nnobility of his profession. His earnestness saved him from the\r\nfrivolity into which a light heart and good health might have led him,\r\nand compensated for his disinclination to devote all his spare time to\r\nthe severer studies of his college.\r\n\r\nOn June 23rd, 1852, nearly four years after he entered the Royal\r\nMilitary Academy, Charles Gordon passed out with the rank of second\r\nlieutenant in the Royal Engineers. Notwithstanding some remissness in\r\nhis work, he had passed through all his examinations--\"Those terrible\r\nexaminations,\" as he said long years afterwards--\"how I remember them!\r\nSometimes I dream of them,\"--and in accordance with the regulations in\r\nforce he was sent to Chatham for the purpose of completing there his\r\ntechnical training as an engineer officer. Chatham, as is well known,\r\nis the Headquarters of the Royal Engineer Corps, to which it stands in\r\nthe same relation as Woolwich to the Artillery. There Gordon remained\r\nuntil February 1854, constantly engaged on field work and in making\r\nplans and surveys, at which his old skill as a draughtsman soon made\r\nhim exceptionally competent. This kind of work was also far more\r\ncongenial to him than the cramming at the Academy, and he soon gained\r\nthe reputation of being an intelligent and hard-working subaltern. In\r\nthe month named he attained the grade of full lieutenant, and on\r\ntaking his step he was at once ordered to Pembroke Dock, then one of\r\nthe busiest naval depots and most important military arsenals in the\r\ncountry. The war clouds were already lowering over Eastern Europe, and\r\nalthough all hope of maintaining peace had not been abandoned,\r\narrangements were in progress for the despatch, if necessary, of a\r\nstrong naval and military expedition to the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nAt Pembroke, Gordon was at once employed on the construction of the\r\nnew fortifications and batteries considered necessary for the defence\r\nof so important a position, and in one of his letters home he wrote:\r\n\"I have been very busy in doing plans for another fort, to be built at\r\nthe entrance of the haven. I pity the officers and men who will have\r\nto live in these forts, as they are in the most desolate places, seven\r\nmiles from any town, and fifteen from any conveyance.\" Seclusion and\r\nsolitude had evidently no charms for him at that period. In another\r\nletter about this time he wrote expressing his relief at being \"free\r\nfrom the temptations of a line regiment,\" and concluded with the\r\nself-depreciatory remark that he was \"such a miserable wretch that he\r\nwas sure to be led away.\" In yet another letter from Pembroke, written\r\nnot many weeks after his arrival, he reveals something of the deep\r\nreligious feeling which was no doubt greatly strengthened by his\r\nexperiences in the Crimea, and which became stronger and more\r\npronounced as years went on. In writing to his favourite sister in the\r\nsummer of 1854, he gives the following interesting bit of biographical\r\ninformation: \"You know I never was confirmed. When I was a cadet I\r\nthought it was a useless sin, as I did not intend to alter (not that\r\nit was in my power to be converted when I chose). I, however, took my\r\nfirst sacrament on Easter Day (16th April 1854) and have communed ever\r\nsince.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Gordon was still occupied on the Pembroke fortifications when\r\nwar broke out with Russia on the Eastern Question. His father was at\r\nthe time stationed at Gibraltar in command of the Royal Artillery, and\r\nwas never employed nearer the scene of hostilities during the war. But\r\nhis two elder brothers were at the front--the eldest, the late Sir\r\nHenry Gordon, at Balaclava, where he served in the Commissariat, and\r\nthe next brother, the late General Enderby Gordon, with his battery\r\nunder Lord Raglan. At the battle of the Alma, fought on 20th September\r\n1854, Enderby Gordon specially distinguished himself, for he worked\r\none of the two guns of Turner's Battery, which exercised such a\r\ndecisive influence on the fortunes of the day. Readers of Kinglake's\r\n\"History\" will remember that it was the flank fire of these two guns\r\nwhich compelled the Russian battery of sixteen guns on the Causeway to\r\nretire and thus expose the Russian front to our attack. It is a little\r\ncurious to find that while one brother was thus distinguishing himself\r\nin the first battle of the war, another was writing from Pembroke Dock\r\nas follows: \"---- says there were no artillery engaged in the battle\r\nof the Alma, so that Enderby was safe out of that.\" Enderby Gordon\r\nalso distinguished himself at Inkerman, where he acted as aide-de-camp\r\nto General Strangeways. He subsequently earned the reputation of a\r\ngood officer during the Indian Mutiny, and when he died he had, like\r\nhis father, attained the rank of Lieutenant-General, and received\r\nbesides the Companionship of the Bath. One characteristic incident has\r\nbeen recorded of him. As he commanded a column in India, he had only\r\nto ask for promotion to obtain it; this he declined to do, because he\r\nwould thus have stepped over a friend.\r\n\r\nIn General Gordon's own letters from the Crimea there are frequent\r\nreferences to his eldest brother, Henry Gordon, a man of whom it may\r\nbe said here that the best was never publicly known, for during a long\r\nand varied career, first in the combative branch of the army as an\r\nofficer of the 59th Regiment, and then as a non-combative officer in\r\nthe Ordnance Department, he showed much ability, but had few\r\nopportunities of special distinction. In several of General Gordon's\r\ntransactions Sir Henry was closely mixed up, especially with the Congo\r\nmission; and I should like to say, of my own knowledge, that he was\r\nthoroughly in sympathy with all his projects for the suppression of\r\nthe slave trade, had mastered the voluminous Blue Books and official\r\npapers, from the time of Ismail to the dark days of Khartoum, in so\r\nthorough a manner that the smallest detail was fixed in his brain, and\r\nhad so completely assimilated his brother's views that an hour's\r\nconsultation with him was almost as fertile a source of inspiration\r\nas it would have been with the General himself. I believe that the\r\noriginal cause of Sir Henry's influence over his brother was that he\r\ndisclaimed having any, and that he most carefully avoided any attempt\r\nto force his advice on his younger brother, as so many of our elders\r\ndeem to be their right and prerogative. General Gordon was a bad\r\nlistener to advice at any time or from anyone. He acted almost\r\nentirely on his own judgment, and still more on his own impulse. His\r\nfirst thoughts were his best thoughts, or, perhaps, as Tennyson says,\r\n\"his third thoughts, which are a maturer first.\" Sir Henry knew the\r\ningrained and unalterable character of his brother, and adapted\r\nhimself to it, partly through affection and partly through admiration,\r\nfor in his eyes Charles Gordon was the truest of heroes. No man ever\r\npossessed a truer or more solicitous friend than General Gordon found\r\nin him. Sir Henry was thoroughly devoted to him and his interests, and\r\ncarried out all his wishes and instructions to the very letter.\r\n\r\nHaving said this much about the relations between Gordon and his\r\nbrother, it would be an inexcusable omission to pass over the still\r\nmore striking sympathy and affection that united him with his sisters.\r\nFrom his first appointment into the service he corresponded on\r\nreligious and serious subjects with his elder sister, the late Miss\r\nGordon, who only survived her brother a few years, with remarkable\r\nregularity, and as time went on the correspondence became more, rather\r\nthan less constant, and in his letters to her were to be found his\r\nmost secret thoughts and aspirations. Most of the letters from the\r\nCrimea were addressed to his mother; but, in an interesting volume\r\npublished in 1888, Miss Gordon presented the world with the remainder\r\nof her brother's letters, spread over thirty active and eventful\r\nyears. One of General Gordon's most cherished objects, resembling in\r\nthat, as in other respects, Lord Lawrence, was to add to the comfort\r\nof his sisters, and when he left England on his last fatal mission to\r\nEgypt, his will, made the night before he left for Brussels, provided\r\nthat all he possessed should be held in trust for the benefit of his\r\nwell-beloved sister, Mary Augusta, and that it was to pass only on her\r\ndeath to the heirs he therein designated. It is not necessary to enter\r\ninto fuller particulars on this subject, but it may be proper to say\r\nthat his affection for his other sisters was not less warm or less\r\nreciprocated. Of his six sisters, of whom two alone survive, it is\r\nonly necessary to refer here (in addition to Miss Gordon) to the\r\nyoungest, who married Dr Andrew Moffitt, who was not merely head\r\nmedical officer with the Ever Victorious Army, but Gordon's right-hand\r\nman in China. Dr Moffitt was a man of high courage; on one occasion he\r\nsaved Gordon's life when a Taeping attempted to murder him in his\r\ntent, and an English officer, who served with the Force, has described\r\nhim in these two lines: \"He was imbued with the same spirit as his\r\nfuture brother-in-law; he was a clever Chinese scholar and an A1\r\nsurgeon.\" Dr Moffitt, who received a gold medal and order, besides the\r\nRed Button of a Mandarin, from the Chinese Government for his\r\nbrilliant services against the Taepings, died prematurely. To say less\r\nabout these family relations would be an omission; to say more would\r\nbe an intrusion, and they may be left with the reflection that as no\r\none who knew him will dispute the depth and the strength of General\r\nGordon's sentiments as a friend, his feelings towards the members of\r\nhis own family cannot well be impugned.\r\n\r\nSome account of the personal appearance of General Gordon will be\r\ndeemed necessary, and may be appropriately given at this stage,\r\nalthough the subject is a dangerous one, because so very few people\r\nform the same impression about any one's appearance. There has been\r\nmuch discussion as to General Gordon's exact height, and I have been\r\nto much pains to obtain some decisive evidence on the subject.\r\nUnfortunately no such records as to height, etc., are kept about\r\nofficers, and my search proved fruitless, more especially as the\r\nrecords at Woolwich for the period required were destroyed by fire\r\nsome years ago. The best evidence I have obtained is that of General\r\nGordon's tailors, Messrs Batten & Sons, of Southampton, who write: \"We\r\nconsider, by measurements in our books, that General Gordon was 5 ft.\r\n9 in.\" As he had contracted a slight stoop, or, more correctly\r\nspeaking, carried his head thrown forward, he looked in later life\r\nmuch less than his real height. The quotations at the end of this\r\nchapter will show some difference of opinion. His figure was very\r\nslight, but his nervous energy could never be repressed, and he was\r\nprobably stronger than his appearance suggested. The suggestion of\r\ndelicate health in his look and aspect, arising, as he was led to\r\nbelieve, but erroneously, from _angina pectoris_, or some mysterious\r\nchest pain, may have induced a belief that he was not robust, but this\r\nseems to have been baseless, because throughout his life, whether in\r\nthe trenches of Sebastopol, the marshes of the Yangtse delta, or the\r\narid plains of the Soudan, he appears to have equally enjoyed\r\nexcellent health.\r\n\r\nThe only specific mention of serious illness was during his stay in\r\nthe Soudan as Governor-General, when the chest pains became acute.\r\nThese were at length traced to an enlarged liver, and perhaps the\r\ncomplaint was aggravated by excessive smoking. In the desert, far\r\nremoved from medical aid, he obtained much relief from the use of\r\nWarburg's Tincture.\r\n\r\nIn his ordinary moods there was nothing striking about the face. The\r\ncolour of the eye was too light--yet the glance was as keen as a\r\nrapier, and, as the little Soudan boy Capsune, whom he had educated,\r\nsaid, \"Gordon's eyes looked you through and through\"--the features\r\nwere not sufficiently marked, the carriage of the man was too\r\ndiffident and modest to arrest or detain attention, and the\r\nexplanation of the universal badness of the numerous photographs taken\r\nof him at all stages of his career is probably to be found in the\r\ndeficiency of colouring and contrast. Everything in his appearance\r\ndepended on expression, and expression generally baffles the\r\nphotographer. Perhaps the least objectionable of all these\r\nportraitures is the steel plate in Dr Birkbeck Hill's volume on\r\n\"Gordon in Central Africa,\" and that not because it is a faithful\r\nlikeness, but because it represents a bust that might well be imagined\r\nto belong to a hero. It was only when some great idea or some subject\r\nin which he was interested seized his imagination that one could\r\nperceive that the square jaw denoted unshakable resolution, and that\r\nthe pale blue eye could flash with the fire of a born leader of men.\r\nIn tranquil moments no one would have been struck by a casual glance\r\nat his face, but these were rare, for in congenial company, and with\r\npersons he trusted, Gordon was never tranquil, pacing up and down the\r\nroom, with only brief stops to impress a point on his listener by\r\nholding his arm for a few seconds, and looking at him intently to see\r\nif he followed with understanding and interest the drift of his\r\nremarks, lighting cigarette after cigarette to enable him to curb his\r\nown impetuosity, and demonstrating in every act and phrase the truth\r\nof his own words that \"inaction was intolerable to him.\" Such was the\r\nman as I recall him on the all too few occasions when it was my\r\nprivilege and good fortune to receive him during his brief visits to\r\nLondon of late years, and to hear from him his confidential views on\r\nthe questions in which he took so deep an interest. One final remark\r\nmust be hazarded about the most remarkable point after all in General\r\nGordon's personality. I refer to his voice. It was singularly sweet,\r\nand for a man modulated in a very low tone, but there was nothing\r\nwomanish about it, as was the case with his able contemporary Sir\r\nBartle Frere, whose voice was distinctly feminine in its timbre. I\r\nknow of no other way to describe it than to say that it seemed to me\r\nto express the thorough and transparent goodness of the speaker, and\r\nthe exquisite gentleness of his nature. If angels speak with the human\r\nvoice, Gordon's tone must have borne affinity to theirs.\r\n\r\nIn completing this subject it may be appropriate to quote a few of the\r\nmore important and interesting descriptions of his personal\r\nappearance, contributed by those who had opportunities of seeing him.\r\n\r\nAn officer, who served with General Gordon in China, describes his\r\nfirst interview with him in the following words:--\r\n\r\n     \"C---- introduced me to a light-built, active, wiry, middle-sized\r\n     man of about thirty-two years of age, in the undress uniform of\r\n     the Royal Engineers. The countenance bore a pleasant frank\r\n     appearance, eyes light blue, with a fearless look in them, hair\r\n     crisp and inclined to curl, conversation short and decided. This\r\n     was Major C. G. Gordon.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Sir Gerald Graham who, to use his own words, was Gordon's\r\n\"school-fellow at Woolwich, his comrade in the Crimea and China, and\r\nfor many years past a more or less regular correspondent,\" has put on\r\nrecord the following interesting description of the hero, and it\r\nshould not be forgotten that, excepting his companion, Colonel Donald\r\nStewart, and Mr Power, General Graham was the last Englishman to see\r\nGeneral Gordon in this world.\r\n\r\n     \"Not over 5 feet 9 inches in height, but of compact build, his\r\n     figure and gait characteristically expressed resolution and\r\n     strength. His face, although in itself unpretending, was one that\r\n     in the common phrase 'grew upon you.' Time had not streaked with\r\n     grey the crisp, curly brown hair of his youth and traced lines of\r\n     care on his ample forehead and strong clear face, bronzed with\r\n     exposure to the tropical sun. His usual aspect was serene and\r\n     quiet, and although at times a ruffling wave of uncontrollable\r\n     impatience or indignation might pass over him, it did not disturb\r\n     him long. The depth and largeness of Gordon's nature, which\r\n     inspired so much confidence in others, seemed to afford him a\r\n     sense of inner repose, so that outer disturbance was to him like\r\n     the wind that ruffles the surface of the sea, but does not affect\r\n     its depths. The force and beauty of Gordon's whole expression\r\n     came from within, and as it were irradiated the man, the steady,\r\n     truthful gaze of the blue-grey eyes seeming a direct appeal from\r\n     the upright spirit within. Gordon's usual manner charmed by its\r\n     simple, unaffected courtesy, but although utterly devoid of\r\n     self-importance he had plenty of quiet dignity, or even of\r\n     imperious authority at command when required. With his friends he\r\n     had a fund of innocent gaiety that seemed to spring from his\r\n     impulsiveness, while his strong sense of humour often enabled him\r\n     to relieve his impatience or indignation by a good-natured\r\n     sarcasm.\"\r\n\r\nTwo further descriptions by men who served under him at Gravesend in\r\nthe interval between the Taeping War and the first mission to the\r\nSoudan will suffice to complete the personal impressions that may help\r\nthe reader to form some idea of the appearance of General Gordon. The\r\nfirst is from the pen of Mr W. E. Lilley, who brought out a special\r\nvolume on Gordon at Gravesend.\r\n\r\n     \"In Colonel Gordon's appearance there was nothing particularly\r\n     striking. He was rather under the average height, of slight\r\n     proportions, and with little of the military bearing in his\r\n     carriage, so that one would hardly have imagined that this\r\n     kindly, unassuming gentleman was already one who had attracted\r\n     the notice of his superiors by his courage and zeal in the\r\n     Crimean War, and who had won lasting renown by subduing in China\r\n     one of the greatest revolts the world had ever seen. This last\r\n     exploit had gained for him the name by which he was from that\r\n     time best known, viz. \"Chinese Gordon.\" The greatest\r\n     characteristic of his countenance was the clear blue eye, which\r\n     seemed to have a magical power over all who came within its\r\n     influence. It read you through and through; it made it impossible\r\n     for you to tell him anything but the truth, it inspired your\r\n     confidence, it kindled with compassion at any story of distress,\r\n     and it sparkled with good humour at anything really funny or\r\n     witty. From its glance you knew at once that at any risk he would\r\n     keep his promise, that you might trust him with anything and\r\n     everything, and that he would stand by you if all other friends\r\n     deserted you.\"\r\n\r\nThe other impression, formed under precisely the same circumstances,\r\nis that of Mr Arthur Stannard, recorded in the _Nineteenth Century_ of\r\nApril 1885.\r\n\r\n     \"The next moment I was looking into Chinese Gordon's eyes. What\r\n     eyes they were! Keen and clear, filled with the beauty of\r\n     holiness, bright with an unnatural brightness, their expression\r\n     one of settled feverishness, the colour blue-grey as is the sky\r\n     on a bitter March morning. In spite of the beautiful goodness of\r\n     his heart and the great breadth of his charity, Gordon was far\r\n     from possessing a placid temperament or from being patient over\r\n     small things. Indeed his very energy and his single-mindedness\r\n     tended to make him impatient and irritable whenever any person or\r\n     thing interfered with his intentions or desires.... For a man of\r\n     his small stature his activity was marvellous--he seemed able to\r\n     walk every one else off their legs over rough ground or\r\n     smooth.... In Gordon strength and weakness were most\r\n     fantastically mingled. There was no trace of timidity in his\r\n     composition. He had a most powerful will. When his mind was made\r\n     up on a matter it never seemed to occur to him that there could\r\n     be anything more to say about it. Such was his superb confidence\r\n     in himself!\"\r\n\r\nWhen Gordon had been only a few months at Pembroke Dock he received\r\norders to proceed to Corfu, and believing it to be due to his father's\r\nrequest, he wrote: \"I suspect you used your influence to have me sent\r\nthere instead of to the Crimea. It is a great shame of you.\" But the\r\nFates were to be stronger than any private influence, for four days\r\nafter he wrote those lines he received fresh orders directing him to\r\nleave for the Crimea without delay in charge of huts. It seems that\r\nthe change in his destination was due to Sir John Burgoyne, to whom he\r\nhad expressed the strongest wish to proceed to the scene of war. On\r\n4th December 1854, he received his orders at Pembroke, on the 6th he\r\nreported himself at the War Office, and in the evening of the same day\r\nhe was at Portsmouth. It was at first intended that he should go out\r\nin a collier, but he obtained permission to proceed _via_ Marseilles,\r\nwhich he pronounced \"extremely lucky, as I am such a bad sailor.\" This\r\nopinion was somewhat qualified later on when he found that the\r\nGovernment did not prepay his passage, and he expressed the opinion\r\npretty freely, in which most people would concur, that \"it is very\r\nhard not to give us anything before starting.\" He left London on the\r\n14th December, Marseilles in a French hired transport on the 18th, and\r\nreached Constantinople the day after Christmas Day. He was not much\r\nstruck with anything he saw; pronounced Athens \"very ugly and dirty,\"\r\nand the country around uncommonly barren; and was disappointed with\r\nthe far-famed view on approaching Constantinople. The professional\r\ninstinct displayed itself when he declared that the forts of the\r\nDardanelles did not appear to be very strong, as, although numerous,\r\nthey were open at the rear and overlooked by the heights behind. On\r\n28th December Gordon left Constantinople in the _Golden Fleece_\r\ntransport conveying the 39th Regiment to Balaclava. The important huts\r\nhad not yet arrived in the collier from Portsmouth, but they could not\r\nbe far behind, and Gordon went on in advance. The huts, it may be\r\nadded, were built to contain twenty-four men, or two captains and four\r\nsubalterns, or two field-officers or one general, and the number of\r\nthese entrusted to the charge of Gordon was 320. These reinforcements\r\nwere the first sent out to mitigate the hardships the British Army\r\nunderwent during a campaign that the genius of Todleben and the\r\nfortitude of his courageous garrison rendered far more protracted and\r\ncostly than had been anticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOUSE IN WHICH GENERAL GORDON WAS BORN, ON\r\nWOOLWICH COMMON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE CRIMEA, DANUBE, AND ARMENIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Gordon reached Balaclava on New Year's Day, 1855. He found\r\neveryone engaged in foraging expeditions, that the siege of Sebastopol\r\nexcited no interest, that the road from the bay to the hill was like a\r\nmorass, and that a railway to traverse it was being slowly laid down.\r\nGordon remained about three weeks at Balaclava assisting in the\r\nerection of huts, and in the conveyance of some of them to the front.\r\nWhen this task was accomplished he was himself ordered to the\r\ntrenches, where his work could not fail to be more exciting and also\r\nmore dangerous than that upon which up to this he had been engaged.\r\n\r\nBefore following him it will be useful to summarise the leading events\r\nthat had taken place in the Crimea up to this date. War between\r\nEngland and France on the one side, and Russia on the other, was\r\nfinally declared in March 1854, the allied forces landed in the Crimea\r\nearly in September 1854, and the first battle was fought on the Alma\r\nstream on the 20th of that month. In that battle 60,000 allied\r\ntroops--20,000 English, 40,000 French--attacked 120,000 Russians in a\r\nstrong and well-chosen position. The result was a brilliant victory\r\nfor the allies, and there is no doubt that it was mainly won by the\r\ndashing attack of the English Infantry. The losses were--French, 60\r\nkilled and 500 wounded; English, 362 killed and 1620 wounded, thus\r\nfurnishing clear evidence as to the force which bore the brunt of the\r\nengagement. The Russian loss was computed to be not less than 6000, or\r\ndouble that of the allies.\r\n\r\nAs the allied forces advanced towards Sebastopol the Russian Army\r\nassumed the offensive. The brilliant and never-to-be-forgotten Cavalry\r\ncharges on 25th October, of the Light and Heavy Brigades, under\r\nCardigan and Scarlett respectively, at Balaclava in the valley that\r\nstretched at the foot of the hills overlooking the bay of that name,\r\nhad not merely vindicated the reputation of English horsemen for dash\r\nand daring, but had done something--at excessive cost, it is true--to\r\nclear the advance for the whole army. When the Russians, assuming in\r\ntheir turn the offensive, attacked our camps on the heights of\r\nInkerman, they were repulsed with heavy loss on both sides, and with\r\nthe result that more than six months elapsed before they again\r\nventured to show any inclination to attack in the open field, and then\r\nonly to meet with fresh discomfiture on the banks of the Tchernaya.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Inkerman was fought in the early morning of 5th\r\nNovember, and again the brunt of the fighting fell on the English\r\narmy. The Russian General, Todleben, subsequently stated that he\r\nreluctantly decided to attack the English camp instead of the French,\r\nbecause \"the English position seemed to be so very weak.\" Here again\r\nthe losses give no misleading idea of the proportionate share of the\r\ntwo allied armies in the struggle. While the Russian loss was put down\r\nin all at 11,000 men, the French lost 143 killed and 786 wounded; the\r\nEnglish, 597 killed and 1760 wounded.\r\n\r\nThe opinion has been confidently expressed that if a rapid advance and\r\nattack had been made on Sebastopol immediately after Inkerman, the\r\nfortress would have been easily captured; but both before and during\r\nthe siege the Russians made the best use of every respite the Allies\r\ngave them, and this lost opportunity, if it was one, never recurred.\r\nIt will thus be seen that some of the most interesting incidents of\r\nthe war had passed before Gordon set foot in the Crimea, but for an\r\nengineer officer the siege and capture of the fortress created by\r\nTodleben under the fire of his foes presented the most attractive and\r\ninstructive phase of the campaign.\r\n\r\nAt this time the French army mustered about 100,000 men, the British\r\nabout 23,000, and the Russian garrison of Sebastopol 25,000. In\r\naddition, there was a covering army, under the Grand Dukes and General\r\nLiprandi, which, despite its losses at Inkerman, was probably not less\r\nthan 60,000 but the successive defeats at Alma, Balaclava, and\r\nInkerman had broken the confidence of the troops and reduced their\r\nleaders to inaction. The batteries were nearly completed when Gordon\r\nreached the front, and a good deal had already been written and said\r\nabout the hardships of the soldiers. Gordon was a man of few wants,\r\nwho could stand any amount of fatigue, and throughout his life he was\r\nalways disposed to think that soldiers should never complain. Writing\r\nas late as 12th February 1855, when the worst of the winter was over,\r\nhe says: \"There are really no hardships for the officers; the men are\r\nthe sufferers, and that is partly their own fault, as they are like\r\nchildren, thinking everything is to be done for them. The French\r\nsoldier looks out for himself, and consequently fares much better.\"\r\nSomething of the same conclusion had been forced on him when on board\r\nthe French transport between Marseilles and Athens when he wrote: \"The\r\npoor French soldiers, of whom there were 320 on board without any\r\nshelter, must have suffered considerably from cold; they had no\r\ncovering, and in spite of the wet, cold, and bad weather, they kept up\r\ntheir health however, and their high spirits also, when our men would\r\nhave mutinied.\" And again, later on: \"We have capital rations, and all\r\nthe men have warm clothing, and more than enough of that. They of\r\ncourse grumble and growl a good deal. The contrast with the French in\r\nthis respect is not to our advantage.\" It must in fairness be\r\nremembered that the worst of the maladministration was over before he\r\nreached the scene, and that he came with those reinforcements, not\r\nmerely of men, but still more especially of supplies, which ended \"the\r\nwinter troubles,\" and converted them into the sanguine hopes and views\r\nof the spring.\r\n\r\nGordon was not long in the trenches before he came under fire, and the\r\naccount of his first experience of real warfare may be given in his\r\nown words:--\r\n\r\n     \"The night of February 14th I was on duty in the trenches, and if\r\n     you look at the plan I sent you and the small sketch enclosed I\r\n     will explain what I had to do. The French that night determined\r\n     to join their sentries on their right and our sentries on our\r\n     left, in advance of their and our trenches, so as to prevent the\r\n     Russians coming up the ravine, and then turning against our\r\n     flank. They determined to make a lodgment in the ruined house\r\n     marked _B_ on the sketch, and to run a trench up the hill to the\r\n     left of this, while I was told to make a communication by\r\n     rifle-pits from the caves _C_ to the ruined house _B_. I got,\r\n     after some trouble, eight men with picks and shovels, and asked\r\n     the captain of the advance trench to give me five double sentries\r\n     to throw out in advance. It was the first time he had been on\r\n     duty here; and as for myself, I never had, although I kept that\r\n     to myself. I led forward the sentries, going at the head of the\r\n     party, and found the sentries of the advance had not held the\r\n     caves, which they ought to have done after dark, so there was\r\n     just a chance of the Russians being in them. I went on, however,\r\n     and, though I did not like it, explored the caves almost alone.\r\n     We then left two sentries on the hill above the caves, and went\r\n     back, to get round and post two sentries below the caves.\r\n     However, just as soon as we showed ourselves outside the caves\r\n     and below them, bang! bang! went two rifles, the bullets hitting\r\n     the ground close to us. The sentries with me retired in a rare\r\n     state of mind, and my working party bolted, and were stopped with\r\n     great difficulty. What had really happened was this: It was not a\r\n     Russian attack, but the two sentries whom I had placed above the\r\n     caves _had fired at us_, lost their caps, and bolted to the\r\n     trench. Nothing after this would induce the sentries to go out,\r\n     so I got the working party to go forward with me. The Russians\r\n     had, on the report of our shots, sent us a shower of bullets,\r\n     their picket not being more than 150 yards away. I set the men to\r\n     work, and then went down to the bottom of the ravine, and found\r\n     the French in strength hard at work also. Having told them who we\r\n     were, I returned to the trench, where I met Colonel ---- of the\r\n     1st Royals. I warned him if he went out he would be sure to be\r\n     hit by our own sentries or the Russians. He would go, however,\r\n     and a moment afterwards was hit in the breast, the ball going\r\n     through his coats, slightly grazing his ribs, and passing out\r\n     again without hurting him. I stayed with my working party all\r\n     night, and got home very tired.\"\r\n\r\nIn further illustration of the confusion prevailing in the trenches at\r\nnight, he mentions in the same letter that while trying to find the\r\ncaves he missed his way, and \"very nearly walked into the town by\r\nmistake.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the more surprising because Gordon's intimate knowledge of\r\nthe trenches was remarkable and well known. The following testimony\r\ngiven by Sir Charles Staveley affords striking proof that this\r\nreputation was not undeserved:--\r\n\r\n     \"I happened to mention to Charlie Gordon that I was field officer\r\n     for the day for command in the trenches next day, and, having\r\n     only just returned from sick leave, that I was ignorant of the\r\n     geography of our left attack. He said at once, 'Oh! come down\r\n     with me to-night after dark, and I will show you over the\r\n     trenches.' He drew me out a very clear sketch of the lines (which\r\n     I have now), and down I went accordingly. He explained every nook\r\n     and corner, and took me along outside our most advanced trench,\r\n     the bouquets (volleys of small shells fired from mortars) and\r\n     other missiles flying about us in, to me, a very unpleasant\r\n     manner, he taking the matter remarkably coolly.\"\r\n\r\nThe late Sir George Chesney, a very competent and discriminating\r\nwitness, gives evidence to the same effect:--\r\n\r\n     \"In his humble position as an Engineer subaltern he attracted the\r\n     notice of his superiors, not merely by his energy and activity,\r\n     but by a special aptitude for war, developing itself amid the\r\n     trench work before Sebastopol in a personal knowledge of the\r\n     enemy's movements _such as no other officer attained_. We used to\r\n     send him to find out what new move the Russians were making.\"\r\n\r\nThe next incident of the siege described by Gordon occurred about a\r\nweek after his _bapteme de feu_ in the caves. While the French were\r\nsomewhat deliberately making at Inkerman a battery for fifteen guns,\r\nthe Russians, partly in a spirit of bravado, threw up in a single\r\nnight a battery for nearly twenty guns immediately opposite, at a\r\ndistance of not more than 600 yards from the French. As this was made\r\nin the open ground, it was a defiance which could not be tolerated,\r\nand the French accordingly made their arrangements to assault it.\r\nKinglake has graphically described the surprise of the French when\r\nthey discovered this \"white circlet or loop on the ground,\" and the\r\nattempt made by three battalions, with two other battalions in\r\nreserve, to capture it. A battalion of Zouaves, under the command of\r\nColonel Cere, carried it in fine style, but the Russian reserves came\r\nup in great force, and their own reserves \"declining to come to the\r\nscratch,\" as Gordon laconically put it, the Zouaves were in their turn\r\ncompelled to fall back, with a loss of 200 killed. Encouraged by this\r\nsuccess, the Russians gave the French another surprise a few days\r\nlater, throwing up a second battery 300 yards further in advance of\r\nthe first \"white circlet.\" These two batteries, mounting between them,\r\naccording to Kinglake, twenty-two guns, were finally strengthened and\r\nequipped by 10th March, and although the French talked much of\r\nstorming them, nothing was done, much to Gordon's disgust. It was\r\nwhile these operations were in progress that Charles Gordon had a\r\nnarrow escape of being killed. A shot from one of the Russian\r\nrifle-pits \"as nearly as possible did for me,\" he wrote; \"the bullet\r\nwas fired not 180 yards off, and passed an inch above my nut into a\r\nbank I was passing.\" His only comment on this is very characteristic:\r\n\"They are very good marksmen; their bullet is large and pointed.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the first but not the last escape he had during the siege.\r\nOne of his brothers, writing home some three months later, a few days\r\nbefore the assault on the Redan, wrote as follows: \"Charlie has had a\r\nmiraculous escape. The day before yesterday he saw the smoke from an\r\nembrasure on his left and heard a shell coming, but did not see it. It\r\nstruck the ground about five yards in front of him and burst, not\r\ntouching him. If it had not burst it would have taken his head off.\"\r\nOf this later shave Gordon himself says nothing, but he describes a\r\nsomewhat similar incident, which had, however, a fatal result. \"We\r\nlost one of our captains named Craigie by a splinter of a shell. The\r\nshell burst above him, and by what is called chance struck him in the\r\nback, killing him at once.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the three months March, April, and May, the siege languished,\r\nand Gordon apologises for the stupidity of his letters with the\r\ngraphic observation: \"It is not my fault, as none of the three\r\nnations--French, English, or Russian--will do anything.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of May, however, there was a renewal of activity. General\r\nPelissier succeeded to the French command, and, unlike his\r\npredecessors, made it his primary object to act in cordial\r\nco-operation with the English commander. He was also in favour of an\r\nenergetic prosecution of the siege, with the view to an early\r\nassault. All the batteries were by this time completed, and 588 guns,\r\nwith 700 rounds in readiness for each gun, were opposed to the 1174 in\r\nthe Russian fortress. It only remained to utilise this terrific force,\r\nand at last orders were given for the commencement of what was known\r\nas the third bombardment. After nearly two days' incessant firing the\r\nFrench stormed the Mamelon and two advance redoubts. These were\r\nsuccessfully carried and held, at the same time that the English\r\nstormed a position called the Quarries, close under the formidable\r\nRedan. Of this bombardment Gordon gives in one of his letters a very\r\ngood description:--\r\n\r\n     \"On the 6th we opened fire from all our batteries. I was on duty\r\n     in the trenches. I could distinctly see the Russians in the Redan\r\n     and elsewhere running about in great haste, and bringing up their\r\n     gunners to the guns. They must have lost immensely, as our shot\r\n     and shell continued to pour in upon them for hours without a\r\n     lull. Never was our fire so successful. Before seven we had\r\n     silenced a great many of their guns, while our loss was very\r\n     small--only one man killed and four wounded. I was struck\r\n     slightly with a stone from a round shot and stunned for a second,\r\n     which old Jones has persisted in returning as wounded. [It was,\r\n     notwithstanding, a real wound.] However, I am all right, so do\r\n     not think otherwise. Our fire was continued all night, and the\r\n     next day until four o'clock, when we opened with new batteries\r\n     much nearer, and our fire then became truly terrific. Fancy 1000\r\n     guns (which is the number of ourselves, the French, and Russians\r\n     combined) firing at once shells in every direction. On our side\r\n     alone we have thirty-nine 13\" mortars. At half-past five three\r\n     rockets gave the signal for the French to attack the Mamelon and\r\n     the redoubts of Selingkinsk and Volhynia. They rushed up the\r\n     slope in full view of the allied armies. The Russians fired one\r\n     or two guns when the French were in the embrasures. We then saw\r\n     the Russians cut out on the other side, and the French after\r\n     them, towards the Malakoff Tower, which they nearly reached, but\r\n     were so punished by the guns of this work that they were obliged\r\n     to retire, the Russians in their turn chasing them through the\r\n     Mamelon into their own trenches. This was dreadful, as it had to\r\n     be assaulted again. The French, however, did so immediately, and\r\n     carried it splendidly. The redoubts of Volhynia and Selingkinsk\r\n     were taken easily on our side. In front of the right attack a\r\n     work called the Quarries had to be taken, which was done at the\r\n     same time as the Mamelon. The Russians cut out and ran, while our\r\n     men made their lodgment for our fellows. We were attacked four\r\n     times in the night, but held the work. If we had liked to\r\n     assault, I am sure we should have taken the place with little\r\n     loss, some of our men being close to the Redan. The French took\r\n     twenty guns and 400 prisoners, and found the Mamelon so traversed\r\n     as to have no difficulty in making their lodgment. We were driven\r\n     from the Quarries three times in the night, the Russians having\r\n     directed all their efforts against them. Our loss is supposed to\r\n     be 1000 killed and wounded. Nearly all our working party had to\r\n     be taken for fighting purposes. The attacking columns were 200\r\n     strong; one went to the right, and the other to the left of the\r\n     Quarries. The reserve consisted of 600 men. The Russians fought\r\n     desperately.\"\r\n\r\nA further week was occupied with a heavy but desultory bombardment,\r\nbut at last on 17th June what is known as \"the fourth bombardment\"\r\nproper began, and after it had continued for about twenty-four hours,\r\norders were given for the assault to be made by the French on the\r\nMalakoff and the English on the Redan on the 18th June, a date ever\r\nmemorable in military annals. The silence of the Russian guns induced\r\na belief that the allied fire had overpowered theirs, and in\r\nconsequence orders for the attack were given twenty-four hours sooner\r\nthan had been intended. Kinglake, in his exhaustive History, has shown\r\nhow this acted adversely on the chances of the assault, because the\r\nRussian gunners had really only reserved their fire, and also\r\nespecially because the Redan, which we had to attack under the\r\noriginal arrangement between Lord Raglan and General Pelissier, had\r\nhardly suffered any damage from the bombardment. General Gordon's long\r\naccount of this memorable assault will long be referred to as a\r\nstriking individual experience:--\r\n\r\n     \"I must now commence my long story of our attempted assault. To\r\n     take up my account from 14th June, which was the last letter I\r\n     wrote to you, Seeley, my fellow-subaltern at Pembroke, arrived on\r\n     the 15th, and joined the right. On the evening of the 16th it was\r\n     rumoured we were to commence firing again in the morning. I was\r\n     on duty on the morning of the 17th, and I went down at half-past\r\n     two A.M. At 3 A.M. all our batteries opened, and throughout the\r\n     day kept up a terrific fire. The Russians answered slowly, and\r\n     after a time their guns almost ceased. I mentioned in my report\r\n     that I thought they were reserving their fire. [If this view had\r\n     only been taken by the Generals, especially Pelissier, a dreadful\r\n     waste of life would have been averted, and the result might have\r\n     proved a brilliant success.] We did not lose many men. I remained\r\n     in the trenches until 7 P.M.--rather a long spell--and on coming\r\n     up dined, and found an order to be at the night attack at twelve\r\n     midnight on June 17 and 18. I was attached to Bent's column, with\r\n     Lieutenants Murray and Graham, R.E., and we were to go into the\r\n     Redan at the Russians' right flank. Another column, under Captain\r\n     de Moleyns and Lieutenants Donnelly and James, R.E., was to go\r\n     in at the angle of the salient; and another under Captain Jesse,\r\n     Lieutenants Fisher and Graves, was to go in at the Russian left\r\n     flank. We passed along in our relative positions up to the\r\n     advanced trench, which is 200 yards from the Redan, where we\r\n     halted until the signal for the attack should be given from the\r\n     eight-gun battery, where Lord Raglan, Sir G. Brown, and General\r\n     Jones were.\r\n\r\n     \"About 3 A.M. the French advanced on the Malakoff Tower in three\r\n     columns, and ten minutes after this our signal was given. The\r\n     Russians then opened with a fire of grape, which was terrific.\r\n     They mowed down our men in dozens, and the trenches, being\r\n     confined, were crowded with men, who foolishly kept in them\r\n     instead of rushing over the parapet of our trenches, and by\r\n     coming forward in a mass, trusting to some of them at least being\r\n     able to pass through untouched to the Redan, where of course,\r\n     once they arrived, the artillery could not reach them, and every\r\n     yard nearer would have diminished the effect of the grape by\r\n     giving it less space for spreading. We could then have moved up\r\n     our supports and carried the place.\r\n\r\n     \"Unfortunately, however, our men dribbled out of the ends of the\r\n     trenches, ten and twenty at a time, and as soon as they appeared\r\n     they were cleared away. Some hundred men, under Lieutenant\r\n     Fisher, got up to the abattis, but were not supported, and\r\n     consequently had to retire.\r\n\r\n     \"About this time the French were driven from the Malakoff Tower,\r\n     which I do not think they actually entered, and Lord Raglan very\r\n     wisely would not renew the assault, as the Redan could not be\r\n     held with the Malakoff Tower in the hands of the Russians.\r\n     Murray, poor fellow, went out with the skirmishers of our\r\n     column--he in red, and they in green. He was not out a minute\r\n     when he was carried back with his arm shattered with grape.\r\n     Colonel Tylden called for me, and asked me to look after him,\r\n     which I did, and as I had a tourniquet in my pocket I put it on.\r\n     He bore it bravely, and I got a stretcher and had him taken back.\r\n     He died three hours afterwards. I am glad to say that Dr Bent\r\n     reports he did not die from loss of blood, but from the shock,\r\n     not being very strong.\r\n\r\n     \"A second after Murray had gone to the rear, poor Tylden, struck\r\n     by grape in the legs, was carried back, and although very much\r\n     depressed in spirits he is doing well. Jesse was killed at the\r\n     abattis--shot through the head--and Graves was killed further in\r\n     advance than any one. We now sat still waiting for orders, and\r\n     the Russians amusing themselves by shelling us from mortars. When\r\n     we appeared, the Russians lined their parapets as thick as\r\n     possible, and seemed to be expecting us to come on. They flew two\r\n     flags on the Malakoff Tower the whole time in defiance of us.\r\n     About ten o'clock some of the regiments got orders to retire.\r\n     We, the Royal Engineers, however, stayed until twelve o'clock,\r\n     when we were told that the assault was not to be renewed, and\r\n     that we could go. Thus ended our assault, of the result of which\r\n     we felt so sure. The first plan made was that we should fire for\r\n     three hours and go in at six o'clock, but the French changed it,\r\n     and would not wait until we had silenced the enemy's artillery\r\n     fire, and so we attacked at 3 A.M. My father can tell the effect\r\n     of grape from twelve 68-pounders and 32-pounders at 200 yards\r\n     upon a column; but whatever may be the effect, I am confident\r\n     that if we had left the trenches in a mass, some of us would have\r\n     survived and reached the Redan, which, once reached, the Highland\r\n     Brigade and Guards would have carried all before them, and the\r\n     place would have fallen. General Jones was struck by a stone in\r\n     the forehead, but not much hurt. I believe it is said that the\r\n     trenches were too high to get over. As the scaling-ladders were\r\n     carried over them, this can hardly be sustained. So much for\r\n     _our_ assault.\r\n\r\n     \"Now for the assault which was made from the left attack. General\r\n     Eyre had an order given him to make a feint at the head of the\r\n     creek if we were successful at the Redan; however, at five\r\n     o'clock, when we had failed at the Redan, we heard a very sharp\r\n     attack on the head of the creek. The 44th and other regiments\r\n     advanced, drove the Russians out of a rifle-pit they held near\r\n     the cemetery, and entered some houses there. The Russians then\r\n     opened a tremendous fire on the houses, and the men took shelter\r\n     in line, being under no command, their own officers not knowing\r\n     where they were to go, or anything about the place, and no\r\n     Engineer officer being with them. The men sheltered themselves in\r\n     the houses until they were knocked about their ears. They then\r\n     remained in different places--in fact, wherever they could get\r\n     any shelter, until dusk, as, if they had attempted to retire,\r\n     they would have been all destroyed. The men of General Eyre's\r\n     column found lots of drink in the houses. Our losses in the four\r\n     columns are--1400 killed and wounded, 64 officers wounded, and 16\r\n     killed. The French lost 6000 killed and wounded, they say!\r\n     Nothing has occurred since the assault, but it is determined to\r\n     work forward by sap and mine!\"\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent letter he wrote: \"Remember, in spite of all the absurd\r\nreports in the papers, that our troops never once passed the abattis\r\nin front of the Redan, which is sixty yards from it, and that we have\r\nnever spiked a gun of the Russians,\" and before closing his narrative\r\naccount of the Redan, the passage in which Mr Kinglake refers to\r\nGordon's evidence and action on this eventful day may well be quoted.\r\nIt appears from his statement that Gordon lost his temper through\r\nexcitement at the repulse, and even upbraided and used angry language\r\nto his old friend and comrade, Lieutenant, now General Sir Gerald,\r\nGraham, on his coming back to the trenches. Such language, it may be\r\npointed out, could not have been used with less justice to any soldier\r\ntaking part in the assault than to the man who had carried a ladder\r\nfarther than anyone else, and twice endeavoured to place it against\r\nthe Redan. It illustrates the perfervid zeal and energy of the young\r\nofficer, who explained in his letters home how he thought the Russian\r\nfortress might have been carried at a rush, and appropriately\r\nintroduces the passage in which Mr Kinglake records his opinion of\r\nGordon:\r\n\r\n     \"This impassioned lieutenant of sappers was a soldier marked out\r\n     for strange destinies, no other than Gordon--Charles Gordon--then\r\n     ripening into a hero, sublimely careless of self, and a warrior\r\n     saint of the kind that Moslems rather than Christians are fondly\r\n     expecting from God.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot refrain from quoting here a letter I received from Mr\r\nKinglake when I sent him a copy of my edition of \"General Gordon's\r\nLetters from the Crimea,\" etc., as it records a somewhat more\r\ndeliberate opinion on his character and career:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   \"28 HYDE PARK PLACE,\r\n                                   \"MARBLE ARCH, W., _27th July 1884_.\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR SIR,--I indeed feel greatly obliged to you for your\r\n     kindness in sending me a copy of 'General Gordon's Letters from\r\n     the Crimea.'\r\n\r\n     \"Already I have read a great part of the volume, and I need\r\n     hardly say that, apart from the reasons which link me to the\r\n     Crimea, I have been greatly interested by seeing what was\r\n     thought, and felt, and expressed in his early days by this really\r\n     phenomenal man, whose romantic elevation above all that is base\r\n     and common has made him, in even these days, a sort of warlike\r\n     and heroic Redeemer.\r\n\r\n     \"Your Preface well and ably expresses an opinion that is widely\r\n     entertained as to the conduct of our Government towards Gordon,\r\n     and I don't know enough of the question to be able to gainsay\r\n     your conclusion, but it would seem at first glance that,\r\n     considering the imperative reasons, the vast distances, the\r\n     changeful condition of things, and the consequent changes of\r\n     mind, the task of doing justice between the Government and this\r\n     heroic envoy would be one of some complexity. With my repeated\r\n     thanks,--I remain, dear sir, very truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                   \"A. W. KINGLAKE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTen days after the repulse at the Redan, Lord Raglan, the gallant\r\nsoldier over whose bier Pelissier wept like a child, died \"of wear and\r\ntear and general debility,\" as Gordon put it, and the siege again\r\nentered upon another dull and uninteresting stage. Nearly three\r\nmonths were to elapse before the capture of the fortress that had\r\nresisted so long, and the only incident of marked importance during\r\nthat period was the battle of the Tchernaya, in which the officers in\r\nthe trenches had no part. In that action the last effort of the\r\nRussian commanders to relieve the place and extricate Todleben from\r\nhis peril was repulsed by the whole allied forces, for in this\r\nengagement both the Italians and Turks took part, with a loss of seven\r\nor eight thousand men. The only comment Gordon makes on the action is\r\nthat \"the Sardinians behaved very well.\" At last, on 8th September, a\r\nsecond general assault was delivered, the English again attacking the\r\nRedan, and, more fortunate in one sense than on the earlier occasion,\r\neffected a lodgment in the fortress, but were then driven out with\r\nheavy loss. But the French succeeded in storming and holding the\r\nMalakoff, which commanded the Redan, and the Russians retired to the\r\nnorthern side of the harbour during the night after blowing up their\r\nships. The fall of Sebastopol, especially after the doubts held and\r\nexpressed in July and August as to whether the siege would not have to\r\nbe raised, caused the greatest excitement and widespread satisfaction.\r\nGeneral Gordon sent home the following graphic description of this\r\nfinal and at last successful attack:--\r\n\r\n     \"I must now endeavour to give you my idea of our operations from\r\n     the eventful 8th of September to the present 16th. We knew on the\r\n     7th that it was intended that the French should assault the\r\n     Malakoff Tower at twelve the next day, and that we and another\r\n     column of the French should attack the Redan and central bastion.\r\n     The next day proved windy and dusty, and at ten o'clock began one\r\n     of the most tremendous bombardments ever seen or heard. We had\r\n     kept up a tolerable fire for the last four days, quite warm\r\n     enough; but for two hours this tremendous fire extending six\r\n     miles was maintained. At twelve the French rushed at the\r\n     Malakoff, took it with ease, having caught the defenders in their\r\n     bomb-proof houses, where they had gone to escape from the shells,\r\n     etc. They found it difficult work to get round to the Little\r\n     Redan, as the Russians had by that time got out of their holes.\r\n\r\n     \"However, the Malakoff was won, and the tricolour was hoisted as\r\n     a signal for our attack. Our men went forward well, losing\r\n     apparently few, put the ladders in the ditch, and mounted on the\r\n     salient of the Redan, but though they stayed there five minutes\r\n     or more, they did not advance, and tremendous reserves coming up\r\n     drove them out. They retired well and without disorder, losing in\r\n     all 150 officers, 2400 men killed and wounded. We should have\r\n     carried everything before us if the men had only advanced. The\r\n     French got driven back with great loss at the central bastion,\r\n     losing four general officers. They did not enter the work. Thus,\r\n     after a day of intense excitement, we had only gained the\r\n     Malakoff. It was determined that night that the Highlanders\r\n     should storm the Redan the next morning.\r\n\r\n     \"I was detailed for the trenches, but during the night I heard\r\n     terrible explosions, and going down to the trenches at 4 A.M. I\r\n     saw a splendid sight--the whole town in flames, and every now and\r\n     then a terrific explosion. The rising sun shining on the scene of\r\n     destruction produced a beautiful effect. The last of the Russians\r\n     were leaving the town over the bridge. All the three-deckers,\r\n     etc., were sunk, the steamers alone remaining. Tons and tons of\r\n     powder must have been blown up.\r\n\r\n     \"About eight o'clock I got an order to commence a plan of the\r\n     works, for which purpose I went to the Redan, where a dreadful\r\n     sight was presented. The dead were buried in the ditch--the\r\n     Russians with the English--Mr Wright reading the Service over\r\n     them. About ten o'clock Fort Paul was blown up--a beautiful\r\n     sight. The town was not safe to be entered on account of the fire\r\n     and the few Russians who still prowled about. The latter cut off\r\n     the hands and feet of one Frenchman. They also caught and took\r\n     away a sapper who would go _trying_ to plunder--for as to plunder\r\n     there was and is literally nothing but rubbish and fleas, the\r\n     Russians having carried off everything else. I have got the lock\r\n     and sight off a gun (which used to try and deposit its contents\r\n     very often in my carcass, in which I am grateful to say it\r\n     failed) for my father, and some other rubbish (a Russian cup,\r\n     etc.) for you and my sisters. But you would be surprised at the\r\n     extraordinary rarity of knick-knacks. They left their pictures in\r\n     the churches, which form consequently the only spoil, and which I\r\n     do not care about buying. I will do my best to get some better\r\n     things if it is possible. On the 10th we got down to the docks,\r\n     and a flag of truce came over to ask permission to take away\r\n     their wounded from the hospital, which we had only found out that\r\n     day contained 3000 wounded men. These unfortunate men had been\r\n     for a day and a half without attendance. A fourth of them were\r\n     dead, and the rest were in a bad way. I will not dwell any more\r\n     on it, but could not imagine a more dreadful sight.\r\n\r\n     \"We have now got into the town, the conflagration being out, and\r\n     it seems quite strange to hear no firing. It has been a splendid\r\n     city, and the harbour is magnificent. We have taken more than\r\n     4000 guns, destroyed their fleet, immense stores of provisions,\r\n     ammunition, etc. (for from the explosions they did not appear to\r\n     be short of it), and shall destroy the dockyard, forts, quays,\r\n     barracks, storehouses, etc. For guns, Woolwich is a joke to it.\r\n     The town is strewn with our shell and shot, etc. We have traced\r\n     voltaic wires to nearly every powder magazine in the place. What\r\n     plucky troops they were! When you hear the details of the siege\r\n     you will be astonished. The length of the siege is nothing in\r\n     comparison with our gain in having destroyed the place.\r\n\r\n     \"We are not certain what the Russians are doing on the north\r\n     side, and as yet do not know whether we shall follow them up or\r\n     not. We ought to, I think. It is glorious going over their horrid\r\n     batteries which used to bully us so much. Their dodges were\r\n     infinite. Most of their artillerymen, being sailors, were\r\n     necessarily handy men, and had devised several ingenious modes of\r\n     riveting, which they found very necessary. There was a vineyard\r\n     under our attack, a sort of neutral ground where no one dared to\r\n     venture, either Russian or English. We found lots of ripe grapes\r\n     there. The Russians used to fire another description of grape\r\n     into it. One night I was working with a party at this very spot,\r\n     and out of 200 men we lost 30 killed and wounded. We are engaged\r\n     in clearing the roads, burning the rubbish, and deodorizing the\r\n     town, taking account of the guns, etc. Nothing is stirring; the\r\n     Russians fire a little into the town. We hear they are\r\n     retreating, but do not believe it. The French, it seems, took the\r\n     Malakoff by surprise. They had learnt from a deserter that the\r\n     Russians used to march one relief of men out of the place before\r\n     the other came in on account of the heavy fire; whilst this was\r\n     being done the French rushed in and found the Malakoff empty. The\r\n     Russians made three attempts to retake it, the last led by a\r\n     large body of officers alone. Whenever the Russians commenced a\r\n     battery they laid down first a line of wires to the magazine with\r\n     which they could blow it up at any time.\"\r\n\r\nWith this final tribute to the courage of the Russian garrison,\r\nCharles Gordon's account of the siege and fall of Sebastopol closes.\r\nHe took part in the expedition to Kimburn, when General Spencer\r\ncommanded a joint force of 9000 men intended to dislodge the Russians\r\nfrom a fort they had built at that place, and also to attack a corps\r\nof 10,000 men supposed to be stationed at the important town of\r\nKherson. The fort surrendered after four hours' bombardment by the\r\nfleet--the garrison not being \"the same style of soldiers as the\r\nSebastopol men\"--but the Kherson force was never encountered, retiring\r\nas the allies advanced, who in their turn retired for fear of being\r\ndrawn too far into the country. In one of several letters while on\r\nthis expedition Gordon says that the Czar Alexander the Second was\r\nnear Kimburn during the attack, and that he sent the Governor a\r\ntelegram, \"Remember Holy Russia,\" which the Russian General did by\r\ngetting drunk. The expedition was then withdrawn after installing a\r\nFrench garrison in the fort, and Charles Gordon returned to his old\r\nquarters before Sebastopol. A fortnight after his arrival he was\r\nappointed to take part in the destruction of the docks, which was to\r\nsignalise the downfall of Russia's power in the Black Sea. This\r\nclosing episode is very well described in several of his letters\r\nwritten during the month of December 1855:--\r\n\r\n     \"I am now, as you see, stationed in the dockyard preparing the\r\n     shafts and galleries for the demolition of the docks. The French\r\n     will destroy one half and ourselves the other. The quantity of\r\n     powder we shall use is 45,000 lbs., in charges varying from 80\r\n     lbs. to 8000 lbs. The French do not sink their shafts so deep as\r\n     we do, but use heavier charges. The docks are very well made, and\r\n     the gates alone cost L23,000. We are taking one gate to London,\r\n     and the French another to Paris. Our shafts are some of them very\r\n     deep, and in others there are from eight to ten feet of water.\r\n     There is not much prospect of the Russians leaving the north\r\n     side. We can see them hutting themselves.... Our works at the\r\n     docks approach completion, and we hope to blow up some portion of\r\n     them on Saturday. The French blew up one last Saturday. The\r\n     explosion presented a splendid appearance and succeeded\r\n     admirably, not a stone being left standing. The powder for our\r\n     demolition will be upwards of twenty-two tons. The Russians still\r\n     (27th December) hold the north forts, and do not appear to be\r\n     likely to leave this year as their huts are all built. We can see\r\n     them quite distinctly on the other side.... _January 20,\r\n     1856._--We have blown up part of our docks, and are very busy\r\n     with the remainder, which we hope to get over by the end of the\r\n     month. I do not anticipate any movement of the army until March,\r\n     when I suppose we shall go to Asia to relieve Kars, and make the\r\n     Russians retire from the Turkish territory.... _February 3,\r\n     1856._--We all of us have been extremely busy in loading and\r\n     firing our mines in the docks, which required all our time, as we\r\n     were so very short of officers, having only three, while the\r\n     French had twelve. Our force of sappers was only 150 and the\r\n     French had 600. We have now finished the demolition, which is\r\n     satisfactory as far as the effects produced are concerned; but\r\n     having used the voltaic battery instead of the old-fashioned\r\n     hose, we have found that electricity will not succeed in large\r\n     operations like this, and I do not think that anyone will use it\r\n     if there is a possibility of using hose. I am now engaged in\r\n     making plans of the docks, and have not much time to myself. The\r\n     French have done their work very well, using more powder than we,\r\n     and firing all their mines with hose. I will try and get you a\r\n     photograph of the docks as they _were_ and as they _are_, which\r\n     will tell you more than a dozen letters would. We had an alarm\r\n     down here the other night about twelve o'clock. The Russians on\r\n     the north side opened a tremendous fire throughout the whole line\r\n     on us and on the French. We were all out under arms, expecting an\r\n     attack by boats, but after being well shelled for an hour, the\r\n     Russians left off, and all was again silent; but for the time it\r\n     lasted the fire was terrific. I heard afterwards that it was\r\n     caused by a French navy captain, who pulled over to the other\r\n     side of the harbour, and tried to burn a steamer which was lying\r\n     on its side. He and his companions arrived unperceived, found the\r\n     steamer quite new, and were getting into it, when the Russian\r\n     sentinel challenged. They answered 'Russe,' but the sentry called\r\n     'To arms,' and the Russians fired into the boat, and then\r\n     continued the fire from all their guns, I suppose expecting a\r\n     grand attack. Only one man, however, was hurt by a splinter on\r\n     the arm. The French will blow up Fort Nicholas on Monday. They\r\n     only got their order the night before last, and are obliged to\r\n     make a hasty demolition of it. They will use 105,000 lbs. of\r\n     powder in the demolition. The Russians had ruined this fort, but\r\n     had not had time to put in the powder; the excavations were\r\n     complete. It certainly is a splendid fort, mounting 128 guns, and\r\n     capitally finished for barracks. It would hold 6000 men. The\r\n     Russians evidently intended this to be an exceptionally strong\r\n     place, and they appear to have been making a quay all the way\r\n     round the dockyard creek. We have seen a great deal of the French\r\n     engineers; they are older men than ours, and seem well educated.\r\n     The non-commissioned officers are much more intelligent than our\r\n     men. With us, although our men are not stupid, the officers have\r\n     to do a good deal of work which the French sapper\r\n     non-commissioned officer does. They all understand line of least\r\n     resistance, etc., and what they are about. The Russians do not\r\n     molest us much now. We can hear them call out and sing,\r\n     especially on Sundays. We can see them drill, which they do every\r\n     day. They even have the coolness to go out and fish in the\r\n     harbour. We never fire, neither do the French. I do not think\r\n     they purpose leaving the north side; in fact, it would not be at\r\n     all wise of them to do so. We had some French engineers to dine\r\n     with us the other day; they were very agreeable, and we learnt a\r\n     great deal from them about their mining. They used to hear the\r\n     Russians mining within ten feet of them, and when they did this\r\n     they used to put in their powder as quick as possible and blow in\r\n     the Russian mines. The Russians had two systems or layers of\r\n     mines, one about ten feet below the surface of the ground and the\r\n     other about forty feet. The French only knew of the higher one,\r\n     and they found out after the place was taken that their advanced\r\n     trenches were quite mined and loaded in the lower tier. In the\r\n     Bastion du Mat there were no less than thirty-six mines loaded\r\n     and tamped. I saw one myself in the upper tier when I was\r\n     surveying it. They (the Russians) worked out a strata of clay\r\n     between two layers of rock, so that no wood was required to keep\r\n     the earth from falling in.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after these letters a truce was concluded with the Russians in\r\nanticipation of the peace which was ultimately signed at Paris in\r\nMarch 1856. The prospects of peace were not altogether agreeable to\r\nthe English army, which had been raised to an effective strength of\r\nmore than 40,000 men, and was never in a better condition for war than\r\nat the end of the two years since it first landed in the Chersonese.\r\nGordon's correspondence contains two or three remarks, giving\r\ncharacteristic evidence to the strength and extent of this sentiment.\r\n\r\nIn one passage he says: \"We do not, generally speaking, like the\r\nthought of peace until after another campaign. I shall not go to\r\nEngland, but expect I shall remain abroad for three or four years,\r\nwhich _individually_ I would sooner spend in war than peace. There is\r\nsomething indescribably exciting in the former.\"\r\n\r\nAnother comment to the same effect is the following: \"Suders, the\r\nRussian General, reviewed us and the French army last week. He must\r\nhave thought our making peace odd.\"\r\n\r\nGordon did not obtain any honour or promotion for his Crimean\r\nservices. He was included in Sir Harry Jones's list of Engineer\r\nSubalterns who had specially distinguished themselves during the\r\nsiege. The French Government, more discerning than his own, awarded\r\nhim the Legion of Honour.\r\n\r\nThe letters from the Crimea are specially interesting for the light\r\nthey throw on General Gordon's character. They illustrate better than\r\nanything else he wrote during his career the soldierly side of his\r\ncharacter. The true professional spirit of the man of war peers forth\r\nin every sentence, and his devotion to the details of his work was a\r\ngood preparatory course for that great campaign in China where his\r\nengineering skill, not less than his military genius, was so\r\nconspicuously shown. As a subaltern in the Crimea Gordon showed\r\nhimself zealous, daring, vigilant, and with that profound national\r\nfeeling that an army of Englishmen was the finest fighting force in\r\nthe world, combined with an inner conviction that of that army his\r\nkindred Highlanders were the most intrepid and leading cohort. This\r\nwas a far more attractive and comprehensible personality than the\r\nother revealed in later days, of the Biblical pedant seeking to\r\nreconcile passing events with ancient Jewish prophecies, and to see in\r\nthe most ordinary occurrences the workings of a resistless and\r\nunalterable fate. That was not the true Gordon, but rather the\r\ngrafting of a new character on the original stem of Spartan simplicity\r\nand heroism. But to the very end of his career, to the last message\r\nfrom Khartoum, the old Gordon--the real Gordon, the one who will never\r\nbe forgotten--revealed himself just as he was in the trenches before\r\nSebastopol.\r\n\r\nGordon's connection with the Russian War and the Eastern Question did\r\nnot terminate with the Treaty of Paris. On 10th May he received orders\r\nto join Colonel Stanton, for the purpose of assisting in the\r\ndelimitation of the new frontier in Bessarabia. He imagined that the\r\nwork would take six months; it really took a year. A not unimportant\r\nprinciple was involved in this question, and an error in a map was\r\nnearly securing for the Russians a material advantage. At the Paris\r\nCongress it was determined to eloin the Russians from the Danube and\r\nits tributary lakes and streams. The Powers therefore stated that the\r\nRussian frontier should pass south of Bolgrad, judging from the small\r\nscale-map supplied by the Russians that Bolgrad was north of Lake\r\nYalpukh, which opens into the river Danube. When the Boundary\r\nCommission came on the ground, they found that Bolgrad was on Lake\r\nYalpukh, and that if the frontier passed to the south of it the\r\nRussians would have access to the Danube; and therefore, knowing the\r\nspirit of the Treaty, the English Commissioners referred the question\r\nto the Paris Congress. A sketch was prepared by Gordon and his\r\ncolleagues, to show the diplomatists its exact position, and led to\r\nthe frontier being laid down north of Bolgrad and Lake Yalpukh.\r\nAustria, as well as France, Turkey, and Russia, was represented on\r\nthis Commission, and Gordon's comrade was Lieutenant, afterward\r\nGeneral Sir Henry, James, who had served with him in the trenches, and\r\nwho had one day lost his way and walked into the Russian lines, as\r\nGordon himself had so nearly done.\r\n\r\nGordon's letters give an interesting account of his work, and bring\r\nout with his usual clearness all the points at issue; but it is\r\nunnecessary to follow very closely the events of the year he passed in\r\nthe lower Danube region. How excellent his work must have been can be\r\njudged from the fact that the Government sent him back some years\r\nlater to act as British Consul at Galatz. The delimitation work\r\ncommenced with a personal inspection of the frontier from Katamori on\r\nthe Pruth to Boma Sola on the Black Sea, a distance of 200 miles. Then\r\nthe frontier was defined on the map, and finally it had to be marked\r\non the ground with the usual posts and distinctive marks. Thirty-two\r\nseparate plans had to be prepared before the frontier could be\r\nadjusted, and the frequent bickerings and quarrels gave rise to many\r\nsurmises that the negotiations might be broken off and hostilities\r\nensue. The main point of dispute as to Bolgrad threatened to form a\r\n_casus belli_ with even a new arrangement of the Powers, as France\r\ngave up the case, and thus encouraged Russia to prove more obdurate.\r\nBut England and the other Powers stood firm, and Bolgrad was included\r\nin Moldavia.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts give a tolerably complete account of what was\r\ndone. Writing from Kichenief on 9th January 1857, Gordon said:\r\n\r\n     \"We are now settled as to the frontier question. Russia has given\r\n     up Bolgrad and received a portion of territory in exchange equal\r\n     to that surrendered, both as to number of inhabitants and also as\r\n     to extent of land. This mode of compensation will give us more\r\n     than half our work to do over again. I had almost finished my\r\n     plans, and one-half of these will have to be redrawn. However, it\r\n     is a consolation to know that the thing is settled. We heard all\r\n     this by telegraph from Paris, and by the same message learnt that\r\n     we are to proceed at once to work on the frontier in order to get\r\n     it finished by 30th March, and thus allow of the ceded territory\r\n     being handed over to the Moldavians on that day. You may imagine\r\n     what a hurry they are in to get this finished. The Russians\r\n     pretend to believe that they have got the best of the dispute,\r\n     but it will be difficult to persuade the world to be of the same\r\n     opinion. Although so cold, there is not much snow, and it is\r\n     beautifully clear weather, capital for sledging. The new frontier\r\n     leaves Tobak and Bolgrad in Moldavia, and gives a piece of land\r\n     near the Pruth in exchange to Russia.... The territory will be\r\n     given over in two parts. The southern consists of Ismail, Kilia,\r\n     Reni, and Bolgrad, as well as the delta of the Danube. The\r\n     northern part consists of the land between the Pruth and\r\n     Yalpukh.... We have finished our work, everything has been\r\n     signed, and the total number of the plans we have made is upwards\r\n     of 100. For my part, I have had enough of them for my whole\r\n     life.\"\r\n\r\nThis wish was not to be gratified, for before Colonel Stanton's\r\nCommission was dissolved orders came for him to hand over his officers\r\nand men to Colonel--now Field-Marshal Sir Lintorn--Simmons, for the\r\npurpose of settling the boundary in Armenia, where a dispute had\r\narisen about the course of the river Aras, the ancient Araxes. Gordon,\r\nwho had now had two and a half years of foreign service without a\r\nbreak, did not relish this task, and even went to the expense of\r\ntelegraphing for permission to exchange; but this effort was in vain,\r\nfor the laconic reply of the Commander-in-Chief was: \"Lieutenant\r\nGordon must go.\" If Gordon had under-estimated the time required for\r\nthe Bessarabian delimitation, he slightly over-estimated that for the\r\nArmenian, as his anticipated two years was diminished in the result to\r\ntwenty-one months.\r\n\r\nHe left Constantinople on 1st May 1857 on board a Turkish steamer,\r\n_Kars_, bound for Trebizonde. The ship was overcrowded with dirty\r\npassengers, and the voyage was disagreeable, and might have been\r\ndangerous if the weather had not proved exceptionally favourable. On\r\narriving at Trebizonde horses had to be engaged for the ten days'\r\njourney across the 180 miles of difficult country separating that port\r\nfrom Erzeroum, the Armenian capital. The total caravan of the English\r\nand French Commissioners--the latter being Colonel Pelissier, a\r\nrelative of the Marshal--numbered ninety-nine horses; and the Turkish\r\nCommissioner, being unable to obtain any money from his Government,\r\nseized the horses necessary for his journey in a manner that first\r\nopened Gordon's eyes to the ways of Pashas. He stopped on the road\r\nevery caravan he met, threw off their goods, put on his own, and\r\nimpounded the animals for his journey. After a brief stay at\r\nErzeroum--which Gordon describes as a very pretty place at a distance,\r\nbut horribly dirty when entered, and where there are eight or nine\r\nmonths of very hard winter--the Commission passed on to Kars, which\r\nbecame its headquarters. The heroic defence of that fortress was then\r\nrecent, and it is still of sufficient interest as a military episode\r\nto justify the quotation of the evidence Gordon, with his\r\ncharacteristic desire to be well informed, collected on the spot while\r\nthe events themselves were fresh. For convenience' sake, his remarks\r\non Kars and the whole campaign are strung together here, although they\r\nappeared in several letters:--\r\n\r\n     \"Kars is, as you can easily imagine, a ruined city, and may\r\n     perhaps never recover its former strength and importance. As far\r\n     as the works of defence are concerned, they are excessively badly\r\n     traced. A little pamphlet published by Kmety, a Hungarian, gives\r\n     a graphic description of the siege. One thing difficult if not\r\n     impossible to realise without seeing it, is the large extent of\r\n     the position. Kars has been twice in the hands of the Russians\r\n     during the last thirty years, Paskievitch having taken it by\r\n     assault in 1829. We passed the battlefield at Kuyukdere, where\r\n     the Russians in very small force under Bebutoff were attacked by\r\n     a very superior force of Turks, under the direction of General\r\n     Guyon, the Hungarian. By some mistake the Turkish left lost its\r\n     way during the night, and was eight miles distant from the field\r\n     when the right came into action. The battle was very hotly\r\n     contested, but the Turks had at last to retire with the loss of\r\n     several guns. Had the affair gone off as Guyon[1] intended, the\r\n     Russians would have been licked. This battle, I should add, was\r\n     fought in August 1854, before any English officer had arrived in\r\n     this country. The Russian loss was very severe: there were 3,200\r\n     wounded alone brought into Gumri for treatment. The first day\r\n     from Gumri we passed Baiandoor, where the Turks and Russians had\r\n     a small battle in 1853, and where the former lost a splendid\r\n     opportunity of taking Gumri, which was nearly denuded of troops.\r\n     My Turkish colleague, Osman Bey (I believe this officer to be\r\n     identical with Ghazi Osman, the defender of Plevna), was present,\r\n     and got into Gumri as a spy, disguised in the character of a\r\n     servant. The Russian army avenged the slight check they received\r\n     from the Turks by taking all their artillery of the right wing.\"\r\n\r\n     [1] Guyon was an Englishman, but one of the National Commanders\r\n         in the Hungarian Rebellion of 1848. I have given a brief\r\n         account of his adventurous career at pp. 148-49 of \"General\r\n         Gordon's Letters from the Crimea,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAs illustrating his professional zeal and powers of scientific\r\nexamination, the following description of the fortress of Alexandropol\r\nor Gumri is a striking production from so young an officer:--\r\n\r\n     \"The fortress of Alexandropol (40 deg. 47' N. lat., 43 deg. long.\r\n     45' E., 4500 feet above the sea) is situated on the left bank\r\n     of the river Arpatchai, which here forms the boundary between\r\n     Russia and Turkey. It is distant thirty-five miles from Kars and\r\n     eighty-four miles from Tiflis. The plain on which it is situated\r\n     is perfectly level and very peculiar. It has a stratum of alluvial\r\n     soil for the depth of one foot six inches on the surface, and then\r\n     a substratum of fine uniform lava, ten to fifteen feet thick,\r\n     supposed to have issued from Mount Alagos (13,450 feet), an\r\n     extinct volcano thirty miles from Alexandropol. The depth of the\r\n     earth allows the growth of grain, but entirely prevents that of\r\n     trees, which with their roots cannot penetrate into the lava. The\r\n     Russians have taken advantage of this bed of lava in the ditch of\r\n     the fortress. The fortress is well constructed and in perfect\r\n     repair. There are upwards of 200 guns (varying from 36-pounders\r\n     to 12-pounders) mounted on the works, and about 100 in reserve,\r\n     of which 30 are field-guns with their equipment wagons, etc. The\r\n     garrison would be 5000 to 6000, including artillery. There are\r\n     large supplies of ammunition and military stores. The ditch,\r\n     twelve feet deep, of the two western fronts has not been\r\n     excavated near the flanks on account of the expense. The Russians\r\n     have constructed in the centres of the two curtains a\r\n     _caponniere_ with two guns in each flank to defend the dead\r\n     angles caused by the non-excavation of the whole of the ditch. In\r\n     the centre of these two fronts is a large _caponniere_, mounting\r\n     ten guns in the upper tier and eight in the lower tier. This\r\n     _caponniere_ is on a lower level than the enceinte of the place.\r\n     The counterscarp at the north-west and south-west angles of these\r\n     two fronts is for the distance of twenty yards composed of a\r\n     crenellated wall four feet six inches thick. This was caused by\r\n     the irregularity of the ground. The bomb-proof barracks of the\r\n     northern fronts mount in casemate two tiers of fourteen guns at\r\n     the curtains. The flanks have five guns in casemates open to the\r\n     rear, in addition to the guns on the parapet above. The lunette\r\n     in the ditch is eight feet deep. The eastern front has an escarp\r\n     fourteen feet high cut in the lava, and well flanked by the\r\n     _caponniere_ defending the entrances, mounting four guns. The\r\n     bomb-proof barracks in the northern fronts have one tier of eight\r\n     guns in casemate at the curtains, and three guns in each flank in\r\n     casemates open to the rear. The two outworks are closed at the\r\n     gorge with a loopholed wall, flanked by a small guard-house. They\r\n     have no ditches, but an escarp of ten feet in the lava. The tower\r\n     marked _A_ in my plan is sixty yards in diameter, with a well in\r\n     the centre. It has its gorge closed with a ditch and loopholed\r\n     wall. It mounts fifteen guns on the top, and fifteen guns in\r\n     casemate. It is proposed to connect it by a crenellated wall with\r\n     the main work. The tower marked _B_ has a ditch and small glacis.\r\n     It mounts eight guns in casemate, and eight on the top. Its\r\n     object is to flank the long ravine which runs southward from it.\r\n     All the buildings in the interior of the fortress are bomb-proof.\r\n     The great fault of the fortress as it is constructed at present\r\n     is that it does not so much as see the town with its population\r\n     of 9310. It is now proposed, however, to make a large work on the\r\n     site marked _K_ with a view of meeting this want. During the war\r\n     in 1853, when the Turks were 35,000 strong at Baiandoor, six\r\n     miles from Alexandropol, and the Russians had only two battalions\r\n     in the fortress, the latter demolished all the houses which were\r\n     on this ground. I think that should it ever be in our power to\r\n     besiege this place (which is not likely, from the enormous\r\n     difficulty of getting a siege train there), that batteries might\r\n     be established on the hillocks between the fortress and the\r\n     river, to breach the large _caponniere_ and the tower _A_ which,\r\n     from the formation of the ground, would not be opposed by more\r\n     fire than the direct fire of the works they were intended to\r\n     breach, and which would be limited by their circular form to\r\n     about seven guns. The soil is not unfavourable on these hills.\r\n     The hill on which the cemetery of the officers killed at Kars and\r\n     Kuyukdere is situated is also favourable for batteries. The\r\n     principal well, which is sunk to a good depth, is in the\r\n     north-eastern bastion.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Gordon's letters contain two or three interesting descriptions\r\nthat, in view of more recent events, deserve quotation. Of the Kurds\r\nhe thus speaks, and the description stands good at the present day:--\r\n\r\n     \"We met on our road a great number of Kurds, who live as their\r\n     fathers did, by travelling about, robbing, etc., with their\r\n     flocks. Their children are short of clothing. In spite of the\r\n     Cossacks, etc., they are as lawless as ever, and go from Turkey\r\n     to Russia and back again as they like. They are fine-looking\r\n     people, armed to the teeth, but are decreasing in numbers. They\r\n     never live in houses, but prefer tents and caves. On the\r\n     mountains we fell in with the tribes of Kurds, who live at this\r\n     height during the summer months, quite isolated from the rest of\r\n     mankind. I paid a visit to the chief of a tribe of 2000, and he\r\n     passed a great number of compliments on the English. This Bey is\r\n     all powerful with his tribe; he settles all disputes, divides the\r\n     pasture land among the families, etc. Although living in such a\r\n     deserted spot, they read the Turkish papers, and they asked\r\n     several questions about the English war with Persia. They are\r\n     very fanatical, and are much encouraged in their religious\r\n     fervour by the Sultan's agents. Their houses consist of stone\r\n     walls covered with camel's-hair tents, which are quite\r\n     waterproof, and lined inside with capital carpets made by\r\n     themselves. We encamped near them and obtained our milk, etc.,\r\n     from them; but, in order to let us know their habits, they stole\r\n     the horse of the Russian officer's interpreter during the night.\r\n     I should not mind trusting them at all, for the Bey would not\r\n     allow them to take our horses; perhaps this was only from his\r\n     hatred to the Russians.\"\r\n\r\nHe gives some particulars of the Lazes, to one of whose villages he\r\npaid a visit, and as he believed that he was the only Englishman who\r\nhad ever done so, his remarks were based on special local knowledge:--\r\n\r\n     \"On one side of it was Lazistan, and this part of Lazistan is\r\n     peopled by the fiercest tribe of Lazes, who scarcely acknowledge\r\n     even the Sultan. We had an escort of forty infantry, and were not\r\n     molested. This tribe and the Kabouletians supply the\r\n     Constantinople Turks with slaves, whom they kidnap from the\r\n     Gourelians, who are on the Russian side. The Adjars (the tribe\r\n     referred to) are most daring, and even proposed to us to bring\r\n     any person we might choose out to Batoum for L40 to L120. In\r\n     consequence of these kidnappings, etc., a deadly enmity exists\r\n     between the two peoples, and whenever they get a chance they kill\r\n     one another. During the last eighteen months sixty-two people\r\n     have been kidnapped, sixteen killed, and twenty or thirty wounded\r\n     on the part of the Gourelians. The Russian guards of the frontier\r\n     are helpless against these people, for the latter are armed with\r\n     a capital rifle and are also splendid shots, while the Cossacks\r\n     have only a trumpery smooth bore. The country of the Adjars is\r\n     very mountainous indeed, and quite impracticable except on foot,\r\n     being covered with dense forests.\"\r\n\r\nOf Ani, the ancient, once famous, and now deserted capital of Armenia,\r\nhe gives the following picture:--\r\n\r\n     \"We passed through Ani, the ancient capital of Armenia. This city\r\n     is completely deserted, and has splendid churches still standing\r\n     in it. These churches are capitally built and preserved. Some\r\n     coloured drawings on their walls are to be seen even now. The\r\n     towers and walls are almost intact, but the most extraordinary\r\n     thing about so large a place is the singular quietness. There are\r\n     many ruined cities in the neighbourhood, and all dating from\r\n     about the eleventh century. At that period Ani itself contained\r\n     100,000 inhabitants and 500 churches, which shows that more\r\n     people went to church among them than with us. Before the end of\r\n     that century it passed into the hands of the Greeks and Saracens.\r\n     Afterwards the Mongols took it, and at last an earthquake drove\r\n     out the remaining inhabitants in 1339, since which time it has\r\n     been perfectly deserted. The churches of Ani were built with\r\n     lava, and crosses of black lava were let in very curiously into\r\n     the red lava. With the exception of the churches and the king's\r\n     palace, the city is level with the ground, the foundations of the\r\n     houses being alone discernible. These churches were covered with\r\n     Armenian inscriptions cut on the walls.\"\r\n\r\nThe delimitation work in itself was uninteresting, being carried on in\r\nbarren and solitary regions where there was nothing but rock, without\r\neither grass or inhabitants. Gordon said he would not take thirty\r\nsquare miles for a gift, and yet the Turks and Russians clung to it,\r\nbringing witnesses from among the tribes who would swear whatever they\r\nwere paid for. The question at issue was where the old frontier\r\nbetween the Persian province of Erivan and the Pashalik of Baizeth was\r\nfixed. The Persians ceded the province of Erivan to Russia in 1828,\r\nand both the Turks and Russians had their own, and necessarily\r\nconflicting, views as to where the frontier was. General Gordon's own\r\nbelief that there had never been any real frontier at all was no doubt\r\nthe right one. The English officers, without any assistance from their\r\nTurkish colleagues, who merely looked on when they were not keeping up\r\nthe supply of witnesses, had to effect the best arrangement they could\r\nwith the Russians. In the course of his survey of the frontier, which\r\nhe said he examined almost foot by foot, Gordon came to Mount Ararat,\r\nwhich he very nearly ascended, as he tells the reader in the following\r\ngraphic narrative:--\r\n\r\n     \"When we arrived at the foot of Mount Ararat we were unable to\r\n     proceed along the frontier any further because the ground becomes\r\n     extremely broken by the innumerable streams of lava which have\r\n     run down from it. The ground is black with cinders. They look as\r\n     if quite recently emitted, and no one would imagine from their\r\n     appearance that Ararat had been extinct so long. Our road went\r\n     along the northern or Russian slope of Ararat, and passed\r\n     through a very old city called Kourgai, where there are still the\r\n     remains of a church and part of an old castle. Even the Armenians\r\n     do not pretend to know its history, but some of them say that\r\n     Noah lived there. It is situated half-way up the mountain, and\r\n     there is no living person within twelve miles of it. There used\r\n     to be a populous village named Aralik, with 5000 inhabitants, a\r\n     little above it, but in 1840 an earthquake shook Mount Ararat,\r\n     and in four minutes an immense avalanche had buried this place so\r\n     completely as to leave scarcely any vestige of its site. Not a\r\n     single person escaped, which is not to be wondered at,\r\n     considering the mass that fell. Stones of twenty or thirty tons\r\n     were carried as far as fifteen to twenty miles into the plain. It\r\n     has left a tremendous cleft in Ararat itself. Other villages were\r\n     destroyed at the same time, but none so completely as this. The\r\n     village immediately below Aralik was also destroyed, but the\r\n     graveyard remained untouched, and the tombstones stand up intact\r\n     in the midst of the ruins. The common people say that it was\r\n     saved on account of a saint who was buried there. All these\r\n     places have a very lonely look. Both the Kurds and the Armenians,\r\n     if they can possibly help it, never pass near Mount Ararat, while\r\n     they think it a great sin to ascend it.\r\n\r\n     \"I must now tell you of my ascent, or rather my near ascent, of\r\n     Great Ararat.\r\n\r\n     \"I and my interpreter and three sappers went up to a Kurdish\r\n     encampment where an old Kurd lived who assisted five of our\r\n     countrymen to ascend about two years ago. The only assistance,\r\n     however, that he appeared able to give us was to show us where\r\n     these Englishmen had encamped the night before their ascent. We\r\n     consequently pitched our tents there, and settled ourselves for\r\n     the night. The night proved to be very stormy, with thunder and\r\n     rain, which was a bad lookout for us. However, we started at 4\r\n     A.M. the next morning, and had some very hard work up to the line\r\n     of perpetual snow. My interpreter and two of the sappers gave it\r\n     up before this, but I and the other, Corporal Fisher, held on.\r\n\r\n     \"The whole of this time there was a thick fog, which now and then\r\n     cleared away, though only for brief moments, and enabled us to\r\n     get a splendid view of the country spread out as a map beneath\r\n     us, with cumuli clouds floating about. The snow which I mounted\r\n     was at a very steep slope, and quite hard, nearly ice, on the\r\n     surface. It was so steep that we could not sit down without\r\n     holding on tightly to our poles. Corporal Fisher was about half a\r\n     mile to my left, and had a better ascent as it was not quite so\r\n     steep. About two o'clock I began to get very tired, not able to\r\n     get up more than two yards without resting. This was caused by\r\n     the rarefication of the air. The mist cleared just at this time\r\n     for a minute, and I was enabled to see the summit about 1000 feet\r\n     above me, but still a further very steep ascent. Little Ararat\r\n     was also visible 3000 feet below me. It began to snow soon after\r\n     this, and became intensely cold. The two together settled me, and\r\n     I turned round, although very reluctantly, and sitting down, slid\r\n     over in a very few minutes the distance which had taken me so\r\n     many hours to clamber up. Corporal Fisher managed to get up to\r\n     the top, and describes the crater to be very shallow, although\r\n     the top is very large. The Kurd told me afterwards that the road\r\n     I took was very difficult, and that the other English explorers\r\n     went up a road which was comparatively easy. I believe, however,\r\n     that if the weather had been more favourable I should have\r\n     succeeded.\"\r\n\r\nThis was not his only mountaineering experience. Some weeks later he\r\nascended Mount Alagos--that is, the Motley Mount, from its various\r\ncolours. It is 13,480 feet above the sea, or about 3000 feet lower\r\nthan Ararat.\r\n\r\n     \"We started with some Kurdish guides to the mountain, and after a\r\n     good deal of delay got to the place where the only path to the\r\n     summit commences. Here we were obliged to dismount and take to\r\n     our legs. After about two hours and a half we got to the summit,\r\n     and were extremely glad of it, for although it is not to be\r\n     compared to Mount Ararat, it is still rather difficult. Trusting\r\n     to my Ararat experience, I thought of descending in the snow, and\r\n     started. I was much astonished at finding the slope far steeper\r\n     than I expected, and consequently went down like a shot, and\r\n     reached the bottom one hour and a half before the others. A\r\n     Russian doctor tried it after me, and in trying to change his\r\n     direction was turned round, and went to the bottom sometimes head\r\n     foremost. He was not a bit hurt. There was no danger, as we had\r\n     only to keep ourselves straight. My trousers are the only\r\n     sufferers! I was the first up. None of the Russians succeeded!\"\r\n\r\nWith one more quotation, Gordon's description of Etchmiazin, the\r\ncelebrated monastery where the Armenian Catholicos resides, the\r\nextracts from these early letters may be concluded:--\r\n\r\n     \"We passed through the oldest of the Armenian churches and\r\n     monasteries, a place called Etchmiazin. It professes to be 1500\r\n     years old, and certainly has the appearance of great antiquity;\r\n     it was existing during the time of the ruined city of Ani, and is\r\n     built in a similar style. The relics there are greatly esteemed.\r\n     People make pilgrimages to this monastery from all parts. There\r\n     is, firstly, an arm of St Gregory, which is enclosed in a gold\r\n     case covered with precious stones; next the piece of the ark,\r\n     which is necessarily of great antiquity; a piece of the cross and\r\n     of the spear, and a finger-nail of St Peter complete the relics.\r\n     All these are enveloped in gold cases, and richly ornamented with\r\n     every sort of precious stones. The monastery owns ten villages\r\n     and a great deal of land. The monks gave us a grand dinner, and\r\n     their feeding certainly was not bad. The monks' council chamber\r\n     was splendidly got up, all the ceiling being carved and gilded.\"\r\n\r\nThe concluding stages of the delimitation work were rapidly concluded,\r\nand before the end of September 1857 Colonel Simmons and his staff had\r\nreturned to Constantinople. The illness of all the English officers\r\nexcept Gordon detained them some weeks in the Turkish capital, and he\r\nwrote home that his surveying duties had been superseded by those of\r\nsick nurse. But before the end of October he was back again in\r\nEngland, and met his father and the other members of his family after\r\na still longer interval. While engaged on the frontier commission, his\r\ncomrade in the trenches, Lieutenant William Christian Anderson, of his\r\nown Corps, had married one of his sisters, but, after a very short\r\nperiod of wedded happiness, he died suddenly. After his death a son\r\nwas born who bore the same name, is now an officer in the Royal\r\nArtillery, and served on General Graham's staff at Souakim. Charles\r\nGordon summed up his comrade's character in these words:--\r\n\r\n     \"I am extremely distressed to hear of poor Willie Anderson's\r\n     death, and every one who knew him will be so. He was a sterling\r\n     good comrade and officer, greatly liked by both officers and men,\r\n     and our Corps has sustained a great loss in him. I am so very\r\n     sorry for poor dear ----. It is such a sudden blow to her, and I\r\n     am sure they must have been so happy together during their short\r\n     married life.\"\r\n\r\nGordon, therefore, found a certain amount of gloom in the family\r\ncircle during the Christmas of 1857, and as his desire to join the\r\nstaff of the army was not immediately attainable, the orders he\r\nsuddenly received in April 1858 to again proceed to the Caucasus, in\r\nconsequence of a slight frontier dispute with Russia, were not\r\naltogether disagreeable to him as a return to that active work which\r\nhe loved. For some reason, which was probably the wish to save a\r\nlittle money by economy in travelling, with the view of carrying out\r\nhis generous plans towards others, he took his passage to\r\nConstantinople in a slow steamer from the Thames, touching at Havre.\r\nHe described his fellow-passengers as not very select, but amusing,\r\nand the voyage as \"a yachting excursion, time being apparently no\r\nobject.\" He only remained ten days at Constantinople, and reached\r\nRedout Kaleh in the Caucasus on 3rd June, visiting Sebastopol on the\r\nway. He described it as still an utter ruin; \"the grass had so\r\novergrown the place where the camps stood that it was with difficulty\r\nI found my hut.\"\r\n\r\nOn 12th June Gordon joined his Russian colleague, Ogranovitch, at\r\nOzurgeth; but the Turkish representative did not arrive for a month\r\nlater, which interval Gordon employed in recording his impressions of\r\nRussian and Georgian society in the Caucasus:--\r\n\r\n     \"I dined with the Governor-General, Prince Eristaw, who left the\r\n     next day for Swaneti to overawe the subjects of the late Prince\r\n     (he was shot at Kutais for stabbing Prince Gagarin, the\r\n     predecessor of Prince Eristaw), who do not seem to have realised\r\n     his death. The Prince takes two battalions of infantry and two\r\n     guns nominally as an escort. There are some very pretty ladies at\r\n     Kutais who dance their national dances capitally. They dance\r\n     alone, and all the gentlemen beat time with their hands. I was\r\n     surprised at seeing the ladies wear a sort of bracelet of black\r\n     beads, to which they attached great value. I am sure they are\r\n     nothing more than bog oak.... I have since discovered they are\r\n     _cannel coal, not bog oak_. The ladies are very pretty, but have\r\n     not very cleanly habits in general; they prefer their nails\r\n     tipped, and do not hesitate at taking a bone and gnawing it. They\r\n     live in extremely dirty houses, or rather huts. They are\r\n     generally all princesses, and the men all princes, who, however,\r\n     do not hesitate to accept small donations. I am always in fear\r\n     and trembling lest they should give me anything, as it is\r\n     necessary to give in return. I, unfortunately, happened to notice\r\n     a certain glass letterweight with the Queen on it, and observed\r\n     that it was like Her Majesty. I was given it on the spot, and\r\n     with deep regret had to part with my soda-water machine the next\r\n     day. I admire nothing now, you may be sure. The servants of\r\n     Prince Dimitri Gouriel have made a good thing out of my visit,\r\n     for each time they bring anything--butter, fruit, etc.--orders\r\n     are given that an equivalent be given them in money. My hands get\r\n     quite sticky with shaking hands with so many princes, but I have\r\n     hitherto borne up like a martyr under my trials. On being invited\r\n     to the house of a prince, you would figure yourself invited to a\r\n     palace; but it is not the case here, and you would find it out to\r\n     your cost if you did not take something to eat in your pockets.\"\r\n\r\nThe work of this Commission proved exceedingly fatiguing--Gordon\r\nbreaking in characteristically with the statement: \"I do not complain\r\nwhen there is no occasion\"--and consisted chiefly in replacing the\r\npyramids carefully removed by the population during the twelve months\r\nsince they were erected. The successful result of this Commission was\r\nentirely due to Gordon's energy and untiring labour. His Russian and\r\nTurkish colleagues were always quarrelling, and Gordon had to play the\r\npart of peacemaker--for which, he said, \"I am naturally not well\r\nadapted\"--an admission that may be commended to those who think that\r\nGordon was a meek and colourless individual, with more affinity to a\r\nMethodist parson than the dauntless and resolute soldier he really\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nEarly in October the whole delimitation was concluded, and without a\r\nhitch, much to Gordon's satisfaction. By 17th November he had reached\r\nConstantinople on his way home, but notwithstanding the special\r\nhardships of his work and his long absence from England, with one\r\nbrief interval, he was still anxious for work and action. In the\r\nclosing letter of his correspondence he said: \"I do not feel at all\r\ninclined to settle in England and be employed in any sedentary way,\r\nand shall try and get employed here (Constantinople) if it is\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\nWhile these letters contain a very vivid account of the striking and\r\nremarkable events that occurred during the long military and\r\ndiplomatic struggle with Russia, they are not less interesting or\r\nimportant for the many unconscious glimpses Gordon gives into his own\r\ncharacter. In them may be found references to habits and things which\r\nshow that the young officer was a sportsman, and by no means\r\nindifferent to creature comforts; and as the most careful search\r\nthrough all his later writings of every kind will bring no similar\r\ndiscovery, these acquire a special importance as showing that the\r\noriginal Gordon only differed from his comrades in being more earnest,\r\nmore active, and more enthusiastic. I take at random such statements\r\nas \"Our feeding is pretty good, but the drinking is not,\" \"The\r\nRussians gave a spread [vulgar] on Saturday, noisily and badly got up.\r\nTheir wine was simply execrable,\" and \"How I wish I could get some\r\npartridge shooting! My bag up to the present (on the Danube) is\r\n200--not bad! eh?\" Then again, on a more delicate subject, there are\r\nnumerous references to ladies, and to his appreciation of beauty. In a\r\nchaffing passage in one of his letters, he wrote that one of his\r\nsisters \"wants me to bring home a Russian wife, I think; but I am sure\r\nyou would not admire the Russian ladies I have seen.\" Again, the\r\nladies of the Caucasus are pronounced \"very pretty,\" and \"the\r\nGourelians are beautiful--in fact, I never saw so many handsome women\r\nas the peasants among them.\" At this time Gordon was certainly not a\r\nmisogynist, but I am assured that the rumours as to his having met\r\nwith an early disappointment in love are quite baseless of truth. From\r\na very early period of his life, certainly before the Crimea, Gordon\r\nhad made up his mind not to marry, and was in the habit of going even\r\nfurther, and wishing himself dead. This sentiment led him to\r\nconstantly refer to himself as \"the dead man\"; and some years later he\r\nwrote, \"There is a Miss ---- here, the nicest girl I ever met; but\r\ndon't be afraid, the dead do not marry.\" His own secret opinion seems\r\nto have been that marriage spoilt both men and women, and it will be\r\nat least admitted that if he had married he could never have lived the\r\ndisinterested, heroic life which remains a marvel for the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE CHINA WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nGordon was back in England in good time for the Christmas festivities\r\nof 1858, and a few months later--1st April 1859--he was gazetted to\r\nthe rank of Captain. About the same time he also received the\r\nappointment of Field-Work Instructor and Adjutant at Chatham, where\r\nhis practical knowledge gained in the Sebastopol trenches was turned\r\nto good account in the theoretical training of future officers of his\r\nCorps. He was thus employed when the conflict in China, which had been\r\nin progress for some years, assumed a graver character in consequence\r\nof the Chinese refusal to ratify the Treaty of Tientsin and Admiral\r\nHope's repulse in front of the Taku forts. Gordon at once volunteered\r\nfor active service, and on 22nd July 1860 he sailed for the Far East.\r\nHe did not reach Tientsin until the following 26th September, being,\r\nas he said in his first letter home, \"rather late for the amusement,\r\nwhich won't vex mother.\" Not only had he missed the capture of the\r\nTaku forts, but also the one battle of the war, that fought at\r\nChan-chia-wan on 9th September. He was, however, in time for the sack\r\nof the Summer Palace, which he describes in the following letter:--\r\n\r\n     \"On the 11th October we were sent down in a great hurry to throw\r\n     up works and batteries against the town, as the Chinese refused\r\n     to give up the gate we required them to surrender before we would\r\n     treat with them. They were also required to give up all the\r\n     prisoners. You will be sorry to hear that the treatment they have\r\n     suffered is very bad. Poor De Norman, who was with me in Asia, is\r\n     one of the victims. It appears that they were tied so tight by\r\n     the wrists that the flesh mortified, and they died in the\r\n     greatest torture. Up to the time that elapsed before they arrived\r\n     at the Summer Palace they were well treated, but then the\r\n     ill-treatment began. The Emperor is supposed to have been there\r\n     at the time.\r\n\r\n     \"To go back to the work--the Chinese were given until twelve on\r\n     the 13th to give up the gate. We made a lot of batteries, and\r\n     everything was ready for the assault of the wall, which is\r\n     battlemented and 40 feet high, but of inferior masonry. At 11.30\r\n     P.M. the gate was opened, and we took possession; so our work\r\n     was of no avail. The Chinese had then until the 23rd to think\r\n     over our terms of peace, and to pay up L10,000 for each\r\n     Englishman and L500 for each native soldier who died during their\r\n     captivity. This they did, and the money was paid, and the Treaty\r\n     signed yesterday. I could not witness it, as all officers\r\n     commanding companies were obliged to remain in camp.\r\n\r\n     \"Owing to the ill-treatment the prisoners experienced at the\r\n     Summer Palace, the General ordered it to be destroyed, and stuck\r\n     up proclamations to say why it was so ordered. We accordingly\r\n     went out, and, after pillaging it, burned the whole place,\r\n     destroying in a Vandal-like manner most valuable property which\r\n     would not be replaced for four millions. We got upwards of L48\r\n     a-piece prize money before we went out here; and although I have\r\n     not as much as many, I have done well. Imagine D---- giving\r\n     sixteen shillings for a string of pearls, which he sold the next\r\n     day for L500!\r\n\r\n     \"The people are civil, but I think the grandees hate us, as they\r\n     must after what we did to the Palace. You can scarcely imagine\r\n     the beauty and magnificence of the places we burnt. It made one's\r\n     heart sore to burn them; in fact, these palaces were so large,\r\n     and we were so pressed for time, that we could not plunder them\r\n     carefully. Quantities of gold ornaments were burnt, considered as\r\n     brass. It was wretchedly demoralising work for an army. Everybody\r\n     was wild for plunder.\r\n\r\n     \"You would scarcely conceive the magnificence of this residence,\r\n     or the tremendous devastation the French have committed. The\r\n     throne-room was lined with ebony, carved in a marvellous way.\r\n     There were huge mirrors of all shapes and kinds, clocks, watches,\r\n     musical boxes with puppets on them, magnificent china of every\r\n     description, heaps and heaps of silks of all colours, embroidery,\r\n     and as much splendour and civilization as you would see at\r\n     Windsor; carved ivory screens, coral screens, large amounts of\r\n     treasure, etc. The French have smashed everything in the most\r\n     wanton way. It was a scene of utter destruction which passes my\r\n     description.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to state here that Gordon bought the throne\r\nreferred to. Its supports are the Imperial Dragon's claws, and the\r\ncushions are of yellow Imperial silk. He presented it long afterwards\r\nto the headquarters of his Corps at Chatham, where it now stands.\r\n\r\nOn the exchange of the Treaty ratifications, which took place within\r\nthe walls of the Imperial capital, the force under Sir Hope Grant was\r\nwithdrawn to Tientsin, and after a brief space from China. But pending\r\nthe payment of the instalments of the war indemnity, a garrison of\r\n3000 men, under General Staveley, was left at Tientsin, and Captain\r\nGordon was attached to this force. He had a very busy time of it at\r\nfirst, for suitable quarters had to be provided for our troops, and\r\nGordon was fully employed in the construction of barracks and stables.\r\nAmong the other tasks that engaged his attention at the time was the\r\nmanagement of a fund for the benefit of the Chinese poor, and he was\r\nmuch distressed by an unfortunate accident that attended its\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\n     \"We had collected about nine hundred dollars for the poor, and\r\n     had asked the mandarins to issue tickets to the most deserving.\r\n     This they would not do, so a certain day was fixed upon which to\r\n     distribute the funds. There were about 3000 beggars, and in the\r\n     crush seven women and one boy were killed. The poor women on\r\n     their little feet, on which they are never very safe, were thrown\r\n     down and trampled upon.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteen months that Gordon resided at Tientsin he took\r\nevery opportunity of seeing the country, and as often as he could he\r\nrode from that town along the banks of the Peiho river to the Taku\r\nforts at its mouth. The distance is about forty miles each way, and he\r\ncomputed that he accomplished it not fewer than twenty times. He also\r\nvisited Peking in August 1861, and remained several days on a visit to\r\nSir Frederick Bruce at the British Legation. At that date rumours were\r\nalready current that the Emperor Hienfung, who never returned to\r\nPeking after our occupation, but made Yehol his capital and place of\r\nresidence, was dead. These were true, but some time elapsed before it\r\nwas officially announced that the Emperor had died on the 22nd of that\r\nmonth, the very day that Gordon reached Peking himself, and wrote the\r\nfollowing letter:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Emperor is reported to be dead, and his coffin has been sent\r\n     for; but this is no proof, since it is the custom to send for a\r\n     man's coffin when he is seriously ill, and it is kept for him\r\n     even if he lives fifty years after.\"\r\n\r\nWriting again some time after, he says on the grave event: \"A great\r\noperation relating to the funeral of Hienfung is going on: a marble\r\nblock, weighing sixty tons, is being removed from the quarries to the\r\nwest of Peking to the cemetery in the east. It is drawn along upon a\r\nhuge truck by six hundred ponies, and proceeds at the rate of four\r\nmiles per day. When it arrives it is to be set up and carved into the\r\nshape of an elephant; several other large stones are also _en route_.\"\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting expedition Gordon undertook from Tientsin was\r\nthat to the Great Wall, and here I must borrow Dr Birkbeck Hill's\r\ngraphic description, which is based on a long letter from Gordon\r\nhimself:--\r\n\r\n     \"In December 1861, accompanied by Lieutenant Cardew of the 67th\r\n     Regiment, he made a tour on horseback to the outer Wall of China\r\n     at Kalgan. A Chinese lad of the age of fourteen who knew a little\r\n     English acted as their servant and interpreter, while their\r\n     baggage was carried in two carts. In the course of their journey\r\n     they passed through districts which had never before been visited\r\n     by Europeans. Against the northern side of the city of Siuen-hoa\r\n     (_not_ Si_n_en-hoa, as printed in Dr Hill's book) they found that\r\n     the sand had drifted with the wind till it had formed a sloping\r\n     bank so high that it reached to the top of the walls, though they\r\n     were nearly twenty feet high. Nature had followed in the steps of\r\n     the generals of old, and had cast up a bank against the town. At\r\n     Kalgan the Great Wall was with its parapet about 22 feet high and\r\n     16 feet broad. Both of its faces were built of bricks, each of\r\n     which was three times the size of one of our bricks. The space\r\n     between was filled in with rubble. 'It is wonderful,' writes\r\n     Colonel Gordon, 'to see the long line of wall stretching over the\r\n     hills as far as the eye can reach.' From Kalgan they travelled\r\n     westwards to Taitong, where the wall was not so high. There they\r\n     saw huge caravans of camels laden with 'brick tea' going towards\r\n     Russia. Here they were forced to have the axle-trees of their\r\n     carts widened, for they had come into a part of the country where\r\n     the wheels were always set wider apart than in the province\r\n     whence they came. Their carts therefore no longer filled the deep\r\n     ruts which had been worn in the roads.\r\n\r\n     \"The chief object of their journey had been to ascertain whether\r\n     there was in the inner wall any pass besides the Tchatiaou, which\r\n     on that side of the country led from the Russian territory to\r\n     Peking. They pushed along southwards, in vain trying for a long\r\n     time to find a way eastward over the mountains. It was not till\r\n     they reached Taiyuen that they struck into the road that led to\r\n     Peking or Tientsin.\r\n\r\n     \"In this town, for the first time on their journey, they got into\r\n     any kind of trouble. When their bill was brought them for their\r\n     night's lodging they found that the charge was enormous. Seeing\r\n     that a dispute would arise, they sent on their carts, and waited\r\n     at the inn till they felt sure that they had got well on their\r\n     way. They then, like the three Quakers with whom Charles Lamb\r\n     travelled to Exeter, offered what they thought a reasonable sum.\r\n     It was refused. They tried to mount their horses, but the people\r\n     of the inn stopped them. Major Gordon took out his revolver, for\r\n     show more than for use, for he allowed them to take it from him.\r\n     He thereupon said, 'Let us go to the Mandarin!'\r\n\r\n     \"To this they agreed, and at the same time they gave him back his\r\n     revolver. They all walked towards the Mandarin's house--the two\r\n     Englishmen alongside their horses. On the way Major Gordon said\r\n     to his companion, 'Are you ready to mount?' 'Yes,' he answered.\r\n     So they mounted quietly, and went on with the people. When they\r\n     reached the Mandarin's they turned horses, and scampered after\r\n     their carts as fast as they could. The people yelled and rushed\r\n     after them, but it was too late.\r\n\r\n     \"Some way beyond Taiyuen they came upon the pass over the\r\n     mountains which led down into the country drained by the Peiho.\r\n     The descent was a terrible one. All along the cold had been\r\n     intense--so much so that raw eggs were frozen hard as if they had\r\n     been boiled. To add to their troubles, when they were on in front\r\n     their carts were attacked by robbers; but the Chinese lad--an\r\n     ugly imp--kept them off with his gun. When they drew near\r\n     Paoting-fu they sent on with the lad the two carts and their\r\n     tired horses, which had now carried them for three weeks without\r\n     the break of a single day, and they hired a fresh cart in which\r\n     they thought to ride to Tientsin. But with the boy gone they had\r\n     no interpreter, and in their impatience, 'their new driver'--to\r\n     quote our traveller's own words--'got rather crossly dealt with.'\r\n     They stopped near Paoting-fu for the night. Early next morning as\r\n     they were washing they heard the gates of the inn open and the\r\n     rumble of cartwheels. They guessed what was happening. 'Half\r\n     stripped as I was, I rushed out and saw our cart bolting away. I\r\n     ran for a mile after it, but had to come back and hire another\r\n     with which we got to Tientsin--more than fourteen days over our\r\n     leave.'\"\r\n\r\nFrom this pleasant but uneventful occupation Gordon was summoned to a\r\nscene where important events were in progress, and upon which he was\r\ndestined to play what was perhaps, after all, the most brilliant part\r\nin the long course of his remarkable career. His brother puts the\r\nchange into a single sentence:--\r\n\r\n     \"On the 28th of April 1862 Captain Gordon left the Peiho and\r\n     arrived at Shanghai on 3rd of May, and at once dropped into the\r\n     command of a district with the charge of the engineer part of an\r\n     expedition about to start, with the intention of driving the\r\n     rebels out of a circuit of thirty miles from Shanghai.\"\r\n\r\nBy the end of March 1862 the Chinese Government had sufficiently\r\ncarried out its obligations to admit of the withdrawal of the force at\r\nTientsin, and General Staveley transferred the troops and his quarters\r\nfrom that place to Shanghai, where the Taeping rebels were causing the\r\nEuropean settlement grave anxiety, and what seemed imminent peril. The\r\nTaepings, of whose rebellion some account will be given in the next\r\nchapter, were impelled to menace Shanghai by their own necessities.\r\nThey wanted arms, ammunition, and money, and the only means of\r\nobtaining them was by the capture of the great emporium of foreign\r\ntrade. But such an adventure not merely implied a want of prudence and\r\nknowledge, it could only be attempted by a breach of their own\r\npromises. When Admiral Hope had sailed up the Yangtsekiang and visited\r\nNanking, he demanded and received from Tien Wang, the Taeping king or\r\nleader, a promise that the Taeping forces should not advance within a\r\nradius of thirty miles of Shanghai. That promise in its larger extent\r\nhad soon been broken, and an attack on Shanghai itself, although\r\nunsuccessful, crowned the offences of the rebels, and entailed the\r\nchastisement a more prudent course would have averted. Without\r\nentering into the details here that will be supplied later on, it will\r\nsuffice to say that in January 1862 the Taepings advanced against\r\nShanghai, burning all the villages _en route_, and laid irregular\r\nsiege to it during more than six weeks. Although they suffered several\r\nreverses, the European garrison was not in sufficient strength to\r\ndrive them away, and a general anxiety prevailed among the European\r\ncommunity when the arrival of General Staveley altered the posture of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nBefore Gordon arrived two affairs of some importance had taken place.\r\nAt Wongkadza, a village twelve miles west of Shanghai, General\r\nStaveley obtained a considerable success, which was, however, turned\r\ninto a disaster by the disobedience of his orders. The Taepings had\r\nretired to some stronger stockades, and General Staveley had ordered\r\nthe postponement of the attack until the next day, when the trained\r\nChinese troops, carried away by their leaders' impetuosity, renewed\r\nthe assault. The result was a rude repulse, with the loss of nearly\r\n100 men killed and wounded. The next day the stockades were evacuated,\r\nand within another week the fortified villages of Tsipu and Kahding\r\nwere also taken. It was at this point that Gordon arrived from\r\nTientsin, and reached the scene of action just as the arrangements for\r\nattacking the important village of Tsingpu were being completed.\r\n\r\nThat the Taepings were not contemptible adversaries, at least those\r\nunder their redoubtable leader Chung Wang, was shown by their\r\nattempting to destroy Shanghai by fire, even while these operations\r\nwere in progress. The plot nearly succeeded, but its promoters were\r\nseverely punished by the summary execution of 200 of their number. The\r\nforce assembled for the attack on Tsingpu assumed almost the\r\ndimensions of an army. General Staveley commanded 1,429 British troops\r\nwith twenty guns and mortars, in addition to a naval brigade of 380\r\nmen and five guns. There was also a French contingent of 800 men and\r\nten guns, under Admiral Protet. At Tsingpu Gordon specially\r\ndistinguished himself by the manner in which he reconnoitred the\r\nplace, and then placed and led the ladder parties after two breaches\r\nhad been pronounced practical. The Taepings fought well, but the place\r\nwas carried, and the Chinese auxiliaries killed every one they found\r\nwith arms in their hands. Commenting on Gordon's part in this affair,\r\nGeneral Staveley wrote in his official despatch:--\r\n\r\n     \"Captain Gordon was of the greatest use to me when the task of\r\n     clearing the rebels from out of the country within a radius of\r\n     thirty miles from Shanghai had to be undertaken. He reconnoitred\r\n     the enemy's defences, and arranged for the ladder parties to\r\n     cross the moats, and for the escalading of the works; for we had\r\n     to attack and carry by storm several towns fortified with high\r\n     walls and deep wet ditches. He was, however, at the same time a\r\n     source of much anxiety to me from the daring manner he approached\r\n     the enemy's works to acquire information. Previous to our attack\r\n     upon Tsingpu, and when with me in a boat reconnoitring the place,\r\n     he begged to be allowed to land in order better to see the nature\r\n     of the defences; presently, to my dismay, I saw him gradually\r\n     going nearer and nearer, by rushes from cover to cover, until he\r\n     got behind a small outlying pagoda within 100 yards of the wall,\r\n     and here he was quietly making a sketch and taking notes. I, in\r\n     the meantime, was shouting myself hoarse in trying to get him\r\n     back, for not only were the rebels firing at him from the walls,\r\n     but I saw a party stealing round to cut him off.\"\r\n\r\nA letter from Gordon gives an interesting account of the two\r\nsubsequent affairs at Nanjao, where Admiral Protet was killed, and at\r\nCholin, where the Taepings suffered a severe but, as it proved, not a\r\ndecisive defeat.\r\n\r\n     \"On going through the village a Chang-mow (rebel leader) came out\r\n     of a house rubbing his eyes, evidently having been taking a\r\n     siesta; he was horrified, and bolted, but was soon caught, and\r\n     the sailors had much difficulty in saving his life from the\r\n     villagers, who flew upon and would have killed him. Poor man! he\r\n     had such a nice costume when taken, but in five minutes\r\n     afterwards you would scarcely have known him; all his finery, and\r\n     even more, had been taken from him. The small force encamped and\r\n     entrenched themselves 900 yards from Cholin, much to the surprise\r\n     and anger of the garrison. They came down in force on the next\r\n     morning with no end of banners. Upon the principle that inquiring\r\n     minds should not be balked, they were allowed to come pretty\r\n     close, but then the poor things received a check, and the\r\n     beautiful silk banners were furled up and carried back to the\r\n     town.\r\n\r\n     \"The next day General Staveley sent us word to come back, since\r\n     he would attack Nanjao first, but as there were nearly 1000\r\n     villagers depending upon our protection and crowding round our\r\n     camp, I was sent back with an armed party, and Captain Willes\r\n     remained in front of the town. I went back by a different road\r\n     and came on the General four miles from Nanjao. We marched on,\r\n     and halted near the town, which was reconnoitred during the\r\n     night, and the guns placed in position by 5 P.M. On the 17th we\r\n     opened fire at seven, and attacked the place. Here Admiral Protet\r\n     was killed; he was among 500 men, and was the only one struck.\r\n     The town was a wretched affair, and a good many Chang-mows\r\n     escaped. These Chang-mows are very funny people; they always run\r\n     when attacked. They are ruthlessly cruel, and have a system of\r\n     carrying off small boys under the hope of training them up as\r\n     rebels. We always found swarms of these boys who had been taken\r\n     from their parents (whom the rebels had killed) in the provinces.\r\n\r\n     \"I saved one small creature who had fallen into the ditch in\r\n     trying to escape, for which he rewarded me by destroying my coat\r\n     with his muddy paws in clinging to me. I started soon after the\r\n     attack for Cholin, and got there on the 18th. The rebels had made\r\n     a _sortie_ since my departure, and had got into a pretty mess.\r\n     Willes let them come up and then advanced on them; over sixty\r\n     were killed, and several taken prisoners. The General then came.\r\n     We got our guns in position during the night, opened fire next\r\n     morning, and assaulted at seven. The place was miserable and\r\n     poor. The Armstrong guns, which enfiladed one face, did great\r\n     execution.\"\r\n\r\nThe fruits of these successes were lost by the signal overthrow and\r\npractical annihilation of a large Chinese army at Taitsan. One of\r\nGeneral Staveley's detachments was cut off, and with his\r\ncommunications threatened he found himself compelled to abandon\r\nKahding, and to retire towards Shanghai. Tsingpu had also to be\r\nabandoned, and the garrison suffered some loss in effecting its\r\nretreat. Of the first results of General Staveley's campaign there\r\nthus remained very little, and it was only in the autumn that these\r\nplaces were retaken, and the campaign against the Taepings in the\r\nShanghai districts continued with varying fortune throughout the\r\nremainder of the year 1862 and the early months of 1863.\r\n\r\nWhile these military events were in progress Major Gordon, who was\r\nraised to the rank of Major in the army in December 1862 for his\r\nservices in China, had been trusted with the congenial task, and one\r\nfor which he was pre-eminently well suited, of surveying and mapping\r\nthe whole of the region for thirty miles. This work, necessary in\r\nitself for many reasons, proved of incalculable value to him in the\r\noperations which he eventually undertook and carried out to a\r\nsuccessful issue against the rebels. His own letters show how\r\nthoroughly he fulfilled his instructions, and how his surveys ended in\r\nhis complete mastery of the topography of the region between the Grand\r\nCanal, the sea, and the Yangtsekiang:--\r\n\r\n     \"I have been now in every town and village in the thirty miles'\r\n     radius. The country is the same everywhere--a dead flat, with\r\n     innumerable creeks and bad pathways. The people have now settled\r\n     down quiet again, and I do not anticipate the rebels will ever\r\n     come back. They are rapidly on the decline, and two years ought\r\n     to bring about the utter suppression of the revolt. I do not\r\n     write about what we saw, as it amounts to nothing. There is\r\n     nothing of any interest in China; if you have seen one village\r\n     you have seen all the country. I have really an immensity to do.\r\n     It will be a good thing if the Government support the\r\n     propositions which are made to the Chinese.\r\n\r\n     \"The weather here is delightful--a fine cold, clear air which is\r\n     quite invigorating after the summer heats. There is very good\r\n     pheasant-shooting in the half-populated districts, and some quail\r\n     at uncertain times. It is extraordinary to see the quantities of\r\n     fishing cormorants there are in the creeks. These cormorants are\r\n     in flocks of forty and fifty, and the owner in a small canoe\r\n     travels about with them. They fish three or four times a day, and\r\n     are encouraged by the shouts of their owners to dive. I have\r\n     scarcely ever seen them come up without a fish in their beaks,\r\n     which they swallow, but not for any distance, for there is a ring\r\n     to prevent it going down altogether. They get such dreadful\r\n     attacks of mumps, their throats being distended by the fish,\r\n     which are alive, when the birds seem as if they were pouter\r\n     pigeons. They are hoisted into the boats and then are very\r\n     sea-sick. Would you consider the fish a dainty?\"\r\n\r\nAnd again he writes about the Taepings, who were not in his eyes \"a\r\npeople nobly struggling to be free,\" but a horde of ruthless\r\nmarauders.\r\n\r\n     \"We had a visit from the marauding Taepings the other day. They\r\n     came close down in small parties to the settlement and burnt\r\n     several houses, driving in thousands of inhabitants. We went\r\n     against them and drove them away, but did not kill many. They\r\n     beat us into fits in getting over the country, which is\r\n     intersected in every way with ditches, swamps, etc. You can\r\n     scarcely conceive the crowds of peasants who come into Shanghai\r\n     when the rebels are in the neighbourhood--upwards of 15,000, I\r\n     should think, and of every size and age--many strapping fellows\r\n     who could easily defend themselves come running in with old women\r\n     and children.\r\n\r\n     \"The people on the confines are suffering very greatly, and are\r\n     in fact dying of starvation. It is most sad this state of\r\n     affairs, and our Government really ought to put the rebellion\r\n     down. Words could not depict the horrors these people suffer from\r\n     the rebels, or describe the utter desert they have made of this\r\n     rich province. It is all very well to talk of non-intervention,\r\n     and I am not particularly sensitive, nor are our soldiers\r\n     generally so, but certainly we are all impressed with the utter\r\n     misery and wretchedness of these poor people.... In the midst of\r\n     those terrible times the British and foreign merchants behaved\r\n     nobly and gave great relief, while the Chinese merchants did not\r\n     lag behind in acts of charity. The hardest heart would have been\r\n     touched at the utter misery of these poor harmless people, for\r\n     whatever may be said of their rulers, no one can deny but that\r\n     the Chinese peasantry are the most obedient, quiet, and\r\n     industrious people in the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe propositions referred to in the former of these two letters were\r\nthat the services of Major Gordon should be lent to the Chinese\r\nGovernment for the suppression of the Taeping rebellion, that he\r\nshould assume the command of an Anglo-Chinese legion of which the\r\nnucleus already existed, and that he might enlist the services of a\r\ncertain number of our own officers. Considerable delay took place in\r\nthe execution of this project, as it was necessary to send to Europe\r\nfor the necessary authority; and another explanation was given\r\nsubsequently to the effect that Gordon insisted on finishing his\r\nsurvey first. But Sir Charles Staveley, who nominated Major Gordon for\r\nthe work, has effectually disposed of this latter statement by\r\ndeclaring that the former was the true and only cause. At length these\r\npropositions were sanctioned, and on 26th March 1863 Major Gordon\r\nproceeded to Sungkiang, a town west of Shanghai and south of Tsingpu,\r\nto take over the command of the Chinese force, which had already been\r\nnamed the Ever Victorious Army, and which in his hands justified its\r\nname.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this chapter it will be well to give some account of\r\nthe origin of this force, and of the more important events that\r\npreceded Gordon's appointment to the command. As far back as April\r\n1860 the Viceroy of the Two Kiang provinces had begged the English and\r\nFrench representatives to lend him military assistance in dealing with\r\nthe rebels. The request was not complied with, but when some of the\r\nrichest native merchants of Shanghai, with one Takee at their head,\r\nformed themselves into a patriotic association, and bound themselves\r\nto provide the funds required to raise a European-led force, no\r\nimpediments were placed in their way. In July 1860 the services of two\r\nAmerican adventurers who had had some military experience in Central\r\nAmerica and elsewhere were enlisted and taken into the pay of this\r\nmerchants' guild. Their names were Ward and Burgevine, and they were\r\nboth adventurers of an unscrupulous and unattractive type. In addition\r\nto excellent pay, they were promised handsome money rewards for the\r\ncapture of specified places, and what spoil there was to take should\r\nbe theirs. Such a prospect was very inviting to the bold spirits of a\r\ngreat port like Shanghai, with its trading ships from every quarter\r\nof the world, and they succeeded in recruiting about 100 Europeans\r\nand 200 Manilla men or Spanish half-breeds.\r\n\r\nIn order to test the quality of this force it was decided to attack\r\nSungkiang; and in July, only a week or so after it was organised, Ward\r\nled his somewhat motley band against that place. The result was\r\nunfavourable, as his attack was repulsed with some loss. Nothing\r\ndaunted, Ward collected some more Manilla men and renewed the attack.\r\nHe succeeded in capturing one of the gates, and in holding it until an\r\nImperial army of 10,000 men arrived, when the town was carried by\r\nstorm. Having thus proved its mettle, Ward's force became very\r\npopular, and it was increased by many fresh recruits, chiefly Greeks\r\nand Italians. It also was strengthened by the addition of some\r\nartillery, two six-pounder and later two eighteen-pounder guns.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese merchants then offered Ward and his quarter-master\r\nBurgevine a large reward for the capture of Tsingpu; and their legion,\r\naccompanied by a Chinese force of 10,000 men, who were, however, only\r\nto look on while it did the fighting, accordingly marched on that\r\nplace. The attack made during the night of 2nd August resulted in a\r\nmost disastrous repulse, most of the Europeans being either killed or\r\nwounded, Ward himself receiving a severe wound in the jaw. He renewed\r\nthe attack with fresh men and two eighteen-pounders three weeks later;\r\nbut after bombarding the place for seven days, he was attacked by the\r\nTaeping hero Chung Wang, and routed, with the loss of his guns and\r\nmilitary stores. It was on this occasion that Chung Wang, following up\r\nhis success, and doubly anxious to capture Shanghai because this new\r\nand unexpected force was organised there, attacked that town, and was\r\nonly repulsed by the English and French troops who lined its walls.\r\n\r\nThis reverse at Tsingpu destroyed the reputation of Ward's force, and\r\nfor several months he remained discredited and unemployed. In March\r\n1861 he reappeared at Sungkiang, at the head of sixty or seventy\r\nEuropeans whom he had recruited for the Imperial cause; but at that\r\nmoment the policy of the foreign Consuls had undergone a change in\r\nfavour of the Taepings, and Ward was arrested as a disturber of the\r\npeace. Perhaps a more serious offence was that the high pay he offered\r\nand prospect of loot had induced nearly thirty British sailors to\r\ndesert their ships. He was released on his claiming that he was a\r\nChinese subject, and also on his sending orders to his colleague\r\nBurgevine to return the troops they had enlisted. Burgevine thought he\r\nsaw in this a chance of personal distinction, and before disbanding\r\nthe men he made with them another attack on Tsingpu. This attack, like\r\nits two predecessors, was repulsed with heavy loss, and the original\r\nWard force was thus finally discredited. It should be borne in mind,\r\nto distinguish it from what followed, that it was a mercenary force of\r\nEuropean and Spanish half-breeds, without a single Chinese in it.\r\n\r\nIn September 1861 these two men altered their proceedings, and gave a\r\nnew turn to the whole question. As it was impossible for them to\r\nrecruit foreigners, they induced Takee and his associates to provide\r\nthe funds for a native Chinese force, which they undertook to train\r\nand organise. In this task they made considerable progress, and with a\r\nview to making it popular with the Chinese, and also to give the men\r\nconfidence, this new force was named, probably by Takee, the Chun Chen\r\nChun or Ever Victorious Army. This proud title was given long before\r\nthe claim to it was justified, but its subsequent appropriateness has\r\nburied in oblivion the slender claim it possessed to it on its\r\ninception.\r\n\r\nBy the end of January 1862 Ward had succeeded in training two\r\nregiments of 1000 men each, and with these he captured Quanfuling and\r\n200 boats in the rear of the Taeping force, which attacked Shanghai\r\nfor a third time in that month. When the English and French forces\r\nassumed the offensive before the arrival of Sir Charles Staveley, part\r\nof Ward's Corps accompanied them in the attack on Kachiaou. It led the\r\nattack, and behaved extremely well, thus giving rise to very\r\nfavourable anticipations as to what a properly-trained Chinese army\r\nmight do.\r\n\r\nIn a second action at Tseedong the force maintained the reputation it\r\nhad gained. The Chinese fought with great bravery, and the difficulty,\r\nin fact, was in keeping them back. The English general reviewed them\r\nafter this encounter, and declared himself much impressed with their\r\nappearance. Representations were made at Peking, and on 16th March\r\n1862 an Imperial decree gave the first public recognition of the Ever\r\nVictorious Army.\r\n\r\nAlthough reverses followed, the Corps maintained the reputation it had\r\ngained for steadiness and discipline. Under General Staveley at\r\nWongkadza it acted well and lost heavily, and in all the subsequent\r\nmovements of that officer it took a prominent part. When Tsingpu was\r\ncaptured, as already described, one of Ward's regiments was left in it\r\nas a garrison, but on the evacuation of that place in consequence of\r\nthe return of Chung Wang with fresh and more numerous forces, it\r\nnarrowly escaped annihilation. It was then that the Taeping general\r\nnamed them in scornful irony, \"Cha-Yang-Kweitser,\" or \"Sham Foreign\r\nDevils,\" the point of the sarcasm being that these troops wore an\r\nEuropean costume.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1862, when the heat rendered active operations\r\nimpossible, everything was done to increase both the numbers and the\r\nefficiency of the Ever Victorious Army. By the month of July its\r\nstrength had been raised to 5000 men, the commissioned officers being\r\nall Europeans except one Chinese, named Wongepoo, who had been given a\r\ncommission for special gallantry by Admiral Hope. Ward was in chief\r\ncommand, and Colonel Forrester and Burgevine were his first and second\r\nlieutenants. When the weather became a little cooler in August, it was\r\ndetermined to utilise this force for the recapture of Tsingpu, which\r\nwas taken at the second assault on the 9th of that month, although not\r\nwithout heavy loss in officers and men. Six weeks later the important\r\nTaeping position at Tseki, across the Hangchow Bay and not far distant\r\nfrom Ningpo, was attacked by Ward and a party of English blue-jackets.\r\nThe operation was perfectly successful, but Ward was shot in the\r\nstomach and died the next day. His loss was a very considerable one,\r\nfor, as Gordon said, \"he managed both the force and the mandarins very\r\nably.\" Colonel Forrester should have succeeded to the command, but he\r\ndeclined the post, which then devolved upon Burgevine.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief space the services of Captain Holland of the Royal\r\nMarine Light Infantry were lent to Burgevine in the capacity of Chief\r\nof the staff, and as this was done at the suggestion of the Futai\r\nLi--since famous to Europeans as Li Hung Chang--it did not conduce to\r\ngreater harmony between him and Burgevine, for their antagonism had\r\nalready become marked. An occasion soon offered to fan this feeling to\r\na flame. A Chinese army under Li and General Ching advanced to attack\r\na Taeping position near Tsingpu, at the same time that Burgevine at\r\nthe head of his corps assailed it from the other side. The brunt of\r\nthe fighting fell on the latter, but when Li issued his bulletin he\r\nclaimed all the credit of the victory, and totally ignored Burgevine\r\nand his men. Burgevine did not accept this rebuff meekly, and his\r\nperemptory manner offended the Chinese. The breach was widened by the\r\ndistrust many of the Chinese merchants as well as officials felt as to\r\nhis loyalty, and soon it was seen that the funds so freely supplied to\r\nWard would not be forthcoming in his case.\r\n\r\nBurgevine's character has been described in the following sentence by\r\nGordon himself:--\r\n\r\n     \"He was a man of large promises and few works. His popularity was\r\n     great among a certain class. He was extravagant in his\r\n     generosity, and as long as he had anything would divide it with\r\n     his so-called friends, but never was a man of any administrative\r\n     or military talent, and latterly, through the irritation caused\r\n     by his unhealed wound and other causes, he was subject to violent\r\n     paroxysms of anger, which rendered precarious the safety of any\r\n     man who tendered to him advice that might be distasteful. He was\r\n     extremely sensitive of his dignity.\"\r\n\r\nThe situation between the Chinese authorities and Burgevine soon\r\nbecame so strained that the former presented a formal complaint to\r\nGeneral Staveley, and begged him to remove Burgevine. This, as the\r\nEnglish commander pointed out, was for obvious reasons beyond his\r\npower, but he made representations to his Government, and suggested\r\nthat an English officer should be lent to the Chinese, and he\r\nnominated Gordon as the best qualified for the work. Pending the\r\narrival of the required authority, the Chinese, assisted by\r\nBurgevine's own impetuosity, brought their relations with him to a\r\nclimax. The merchant Takee withheld the pay of the force; Burgevine\r\nwas first ordered to proceed with his troops to Nanking, and then, on\r\nconsenting, the order was withdrawn; some weeks later a fresh order to\r\nthe same effect was issued, and Burgevine demanded the payment of all\r\narrears before he would move, and thus Li's object of exposing\r\nBurgevine as a disobedient officer to the Government that employed him\r\nwas attained.\r\n\r\nThe Ever Victorious Army, excited by the absence of its pay, and\r\nworked upon by the exhortations of its chief, was on the point of\r\nmutiny, and Burgevine hastened to Shanghai to obtain by force rather\r\nthan persuasion the arrears. On 4th January 1863 he saw Takee, a\r\nviolent scene ensued, and Burgevine used violence. Not only did he\r\nstrike Takee, but he carried off the treasure necessary to pay his\r\nmen. Such conduct could not be upheld or excused. Li Hung Chang made\r\nthe strongest complaint. Burgevine was dismissed the Chinese service,\r\nand General Staveley forwarded the notice to him with a quiet\r\nintimation that it would be well to give up his command without making\r\na disturbance. Burgevine complied with this advice, handed over the\r\ncommand to Captain Holland, and came back to Shanghai on 6th of\r\nJanuary. He published a defence of his conduct, and expressed his\r\nregret for having struck Takee.\r\n\r\nCaptain Holland was thus the third commander of the Ever Victorious\r\nArmy, and a set of regulations was drawn up between Li Hung Chang and\r\nGeneral Staveley as to the conduct and control of the force. It was\r\nunderstood that Captain Holland's appointment was only temporary until\r\nthe decision of the Government as to Gordon's nomination arrived, but\r\nthis arrangement allowed of the corps again taking the field, for\r\nalthough it cost the Chinese L30,000 a month, it had done nothing\r\nduring the last three months of the year 1862. Early in February 1863,\r\ntherefore, Captain Holland, at the head of 2,300 men, including a\r\nstrong force of artillery--600 men and twenty-two guns and\r\nmortars--was directed to attack Taitsan, an important place about\r\nfifty miles north-east of Shanghai. An Imperialist army of nearly\r\n10,000 men acted in conjunction with it. The affair was badly managed\r\nand proved most disastrous.\r\n\r\nAfter a short bombardment a breach was declared to be practicable, and\r\nthe ladder and storming parties were ordered to the assault.\r\nUnfortunately, the reconnoitring of the Taeping position had been very\r\ncarelessly done, and the attacking parties were checked by a wet\r\nditch, twenty feet wide and six feet deep, of which nothing had been\r\nseen. Situated only forty yards from the wall of the town, and without\r\nany means of crossing it, although some few did by throwing across a\r\nladder, the storming party stood exposed to a terrific fire. Captain\r\nHolland ordered a retreat, but it was not managed any better than the\r\nattack. The light guns were removed too quickly, and the heavy ones\r\nwere stuck so fast in the mud that they could not be removed at all.\r\nThe Taepings attacked in their turn, and the greatest confusion\r\nprevailed, during which the survivors of the larger half of the Ever\r\nVictorious Army escaped in small detachments back to Sungkiang. Twenty\r\nEuropean officers were killed or wounded, besides 300 Chinese\r\nprivates. Captain Holland exposed himself freely, but this, his only\r\naction in independent command, resulted in complete and unqualified\r\nfailure. Gordon himself summed up the causes of this serious and\r\ndiscouraging reverse:--\r\n\r\n     \"The causes of the failure were the too cheap rate at which the\r\n     rebels were held. The force had hitherto fought with the allies\r\n     with them (except at Tsingpu). They now had to bear the brunt of\r\n     the fighting themselves, the mistake of not having provided\r\n     bridges in spite of the mandarin's information, and the too close\r\n     proximity of the heavy guns to the walls, and the want of cover\r\n     they had, and finally the withdrawal of the lighter guns before\r\n     the heavy guns, whose removal they should have covered. There is\r\n     little doubt that the rebels had been warned by persons in\r\n     Shanghai of the intended attack, and that several foreigners, who\r\n     had been dismissed by Captain Holland, were with the rebels\r\n     defending the breach. As may be imagined, Burgevine's removal had\r\n     caused considerable feeling among his acquaintances, who were not\r\n     sorry to see the first expedition of the force under an English\r\n     officer fail, being in hopes that the command would again revert\r\n     to Burgevine.\"\r\n\r\nThis reverse occurred on 13th February, and no further steps of any\r\nconsequence were taken until the appointment of Major Gordon, which at\r\nlast was sanctioned in the latter portion of March, about a week\r\nbefore ill-health compelled General Staveley to resign his command in\r\nChina. That officer was connected with the Gordon family, his sister,\r\na most amiable and sympathetic lady, being Lady Gordon, widow of the\r\nlate Sir Henry Gordon. As far back as May 1861--that is, prior to most\r\nof the events described in this chapter--Gordon's sensitiveness about\r\nhis family connection with the commanding officer in China had\r\nimpelled him to write this letter:--\r\n\r\n     \"I was much put out in Henry's writing, and I think hinting he\r\n     could do something for me, and I went to Staveley and told him\r\n     so. It is the bother of one's life to be trying after the honours\r\n     of the profession, and it has grown in late years into a regular\r\n     trade--everyone uses private interest.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Gordon gave this early manifestation of his independent spirit he\r\nwas little more than twenty-eight years of age, but it should\r\ncertainly be noted as showing that in one respect he was very little\r\nchanged in his later years from what he was in his youth.\r\n\r\nAfter these reverses in February nothing more was attempted until\r\nMajor Gordon arrived at Sungkiang on 25th March 1863 to take over the\r\ncommand of the force. It is to be hoped that the last few pages have\r\nmade clear what that force was like. In the first place, it had been\r\none composed entirely of Europeans, a band somewhat resembling those\r\nthat have set up and cast down the mushroom republics that separate\r\nthe conquests of Pizarro from those of Cortes. That force achieved\r\nnothing and had an ignominious end. It was succeeded by the larger\r\nforce of drilled Chinese, to which was given the name of the Ever\r\nVictorious Army. Although these Chinese showed far more courage than\r\nmight have been expected of them, none of their leaders--Ward,\r\nBurgevine, or Holland--seemed able to turn their good qualities to any\r\nprofitable purpose. They were as often defeated as successful, and at\r\nthe very moment of Gordon's assuming the command the defeat of Captain\r\nHolland at Taitsan, and a subsidiary reverse of Major Tapp at Fushan,\r\nhad reduced their _morale_ to the lowest point, and even justified a\r\nbelief that for military purposes this force was nearly, if not quite,\r\nworthless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE TAEPING REBELLION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to bring before the reader the magnitude of Gordon's\r\nachievements in China it is necessary to describe briefly the course\r\nof the Taeping rebellion, and to show the kind of opponents over whom\r\nhe was destined to obtain so glorious and decisive a victory. But as\r\nthis would be to tell a thrice-told tale, I content myself with giving\r\nin an abridged form the account I prepared from the papers of General\r\nGordon and other trustworthy sources, which appears in the last volume\r\nof my \"History of China.\"\r\n\r\nAs far back as the year 1830 there had been symptoms of disturbed\r\npopular feeling in Kwangsi, the most southern province of China\r\nadjacent to Tonquin. The difficulty of operating in a region which\r\npossessed few roads, and which was only rendered at all accessible by\r\nthe West River or Sikiang, had led the Chinese authorities, much\r\nengaged as they were about the foreign question, to postpone those\r\nvigorous measures, which, if taken at the outset, might have speedily\r\nrestored peace and stamped out the first promptings of revolt. The\r\nauthorities were more concerned at the proceedings of the formidable\r\nsecret Association, known as the \"Triads,\" than at the occurrences in\r\nKwangsi, probably because the Triads made no secret that their object\r\nwas the expulsion of the Manchus and the restoration of the old Ming\r\ndynasty. The true origin of the Triads is not to be assigned, but\r\nthere seems reasonable ground for the suspicion that they were\r\nconnected with the discontented monks of a Buddhist monastery which\r\nhad been suppressed by the Government. Between them they seem to have\r\nformed the inception of what became the famous Taeping rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1850 witnessed a great accession of energy on the part\r\nof the rebels in Kwangsi, which may perhaps have been due to the death\r\nof the Emperor Taoukwang. The important town of Wuchow on the Sikiang,\r\nclose to the western border of Kwantung, was besieged by a force\r\nreported to number 50,000 men. The governor was afraid to report the\r\noccurrence, knowing that it would carry his own condemnation and\r\nprobable disgrace; and it was left for a minor official to reveal the\r\nextent to which the insurgents had carried their depredations. Two\r\nleaders named Chang assumed the style of royalty; other bands appeared\r\nin the province of Hoonan as well as in the southern parts of\r\nKwantung, but they all collected by degrees on the Sikiang, where they\r\nplaced an embargo on merchandise, and gradually crushed out such trade\r\nas there had been by that river. Their proceedings were not restricted\r\nto the fair operations of war. They plundered and massacred wherever\r\nthey went. They claimed to act in the name of the Chinese people; yet\r\nthey slew all they could lay hands upon, without discrimination of age\r\nor sex.\r\n\r\nThe confidence of the insurgents was raised by frequent success, and\r\nby the manifest inability of the Canton Viceroy to take any effectual\r\nmilitary measures against them. Two hundred imperial troops were\r\ndecoyed into a defile, and slaughtered by an overwhelming force in\r\nambush. This reverse naturally caused considerable alarm in Canton\r\nitself, and defensive measures were taken. Governor Yeh was sent\r\nagainst them with 2000 men, and he succeeded in compelling, or as some\r\nsay in inducing, them to retreat. Any satisfaction this success may\r\nhave occasioned was soon dispelled, for at Lienchow, near the small\r\nport of Pakhoi, the rebels not merely gained a victory, but were\r\njoined by the troops sent to attack them. But these successes at\r\nseveral different points were of far less significance than the\r\nnomination of a single chief with the royal title of Tien Wang, or the\r\nHeavenly King.\r\n\r\nThe man on whom their choice fell was named Hung-tsiuen. He was the\r\nson of a small farmer, who lived in a village near the North River,\r\nabout thirty miles from Canton. If he was not a Hakka himself, he\r\nlived in a district which was considered to belong exclusively to that\r\nstrange race, which closely resembles our gipsies. He belonged to a\r\ndegraded race, therefore, and it was held that he was not entitled to\r\nthat free entry into the body of the civil service, which is the\r\nnatural privilege of every true-born Chinese subject. His friends\r\ndeclared that he came out high at each of the periodical examinations,\r\nbut their statements may have been false in this as in much else. The\r\nfact is clear that he failed to obtain his degrees, and that he was\r\ndenied admission into the public service. Hung was therefore a\r\ndisappointed candidate, the more deeply disappointed, perhaps, that\r\nhis sense of injured merit and the ill-judging flattery of his\r\nadmirers made his rejection appear unjust.\r\n\r\nHung was, at all events, a shrewd observer of the weakness of the\r\nGovernment, and of the popular discontent. He perceived the\r\nopportunity of making the Manchu dynasty the scapegoat of national\r\nweakness and apathy. He could not be the servant of the Government.\r\nClass contempt, the prejudices of his examiners, or it may even have\r\nbeen his own haughty presumption and self-sufficiency, effectually\r\ndebarred him from the enjoyment of the wealth and privileges that fall\r\nto the lot of those in executive power in all countries, but in\r\nAsiatic above every other. To his revengeful but astute mind it was\r\nclear that if he could not be an official he might be the enemy of the\r\nGovernment and its possible subverter.\r\n\r\nThe details of his early career have been mainly recorded by those who\r\nsympathised with the supposed objects of his operations; and while\r\nthey have been very anxious to discover his virtues, they were always\r\nblind to his failings. The steps of his imposture have therefore been\r\ndescribed with an amount of implicit belief which reflected little\r\ncredit on the judgment of those who were anxious to give their\r\nsanction to the miracles which preceded the appearance of this\r\nadventurer in the field. Absurd stories as to his dreams, allegorical\r\ncoincidences showing how he was summoned by a just and all-powerful\r\nGod to the supreme seat of power, were repeated with a degree of faith\r\nso emphatic in its mode of expression as to make the challenge of its\r\nsincerity appear extremely harsh. Hung, the defeated official\r\ncandidate, the long-deaf listener to the entreaties of Christian\r\nmissionaries, was thus in a brief time metamorphosed into Heaven's\r\nelect for the Dragon Throne, into the iconoclastic propagator of the\r\nworship of a single God, and the destroyer of the mass of idolatry\r\nstored in the hearts and venerated in the temples of the Chinese\r\npeople for countless ages. Whether Hung was merely an intriguer or a\r\nfanatic, he could not help feeling some gratitude to those who so\r\nconveniently echoed his pretensions to the Throne at the same time\r\nthat they pleaded extenuating circumstances for acts of cruelty and\r\nbrigandage often unsurpassed in their infamy.\r\n\r\nIf he found the foreigners thus willing to accept him at his own\r\nestimate, it would have been very strange if he had not experienced\r\nstill greater success in imposing upon the credulity of his own\r\ncountrymen. To declare that he had dreamt dreams which showed that he\r\nwas selected by a heavenly mandate for Royal honours was sufficient to\r\ngain a small body of adherents, provided only that he was prepared to\r\naccept the certain punishment of detection and failure. If Hung's\r\naudacity was shown by nothing else, it was demonstrated by the lengths\r\nto which he carried the supernatural agency that urged him to quit the\r\nignominious life of a Kwantung peasant for the career of a pretender\r\nto Imperial honours. The course of training to which he subjected\r\nhimself, the ascetic deprivations, the loud prayers and invocations,\r\nthe supernatural counsels and meetings, was that adopted by every\r\nother religious devotee or fanatic as the proper novitiate for those\r\nhonours based on the superstitious reverence of mankind, which are\r\nsometimes no inadequate substitute for temporal power and influence,\r\neven when they fail to pave the way to their attainment.\r\n\r\nYet when Hung proceeded to Kwangsi there was no room left to hope that\r\nthe seditious movement would dissolve of its own accord, for the\r\nextent and character of his pretensions at once invested the rising\r\nwith all the importance of open and unveiled rebellion. After the\r\nproclamation of Hung as Tien Wang, the success of the Kwangsi rebels\r\nincreased. The whole of the country south of the Sikiang, with the\r\nstrong military station of Nanning, fell into their hands, and they\r\nprepared in the early part of the year 1851 to attack the provincial\r\ncapital Kweiling, which commanded one of the principal high roads into\r\nthe interior of China. So urgent did the peril at this place appear\r\nthat three Imperial Commissioners were sent there direct by land from\r\nPeking, and the significance of their appointment was increased by the\r\nfact that they were all Manchus. They were instructed to raise troops\r\n_en route_, and to reach Kweiling as soon as possible. Their movements\r\nwere so dilatory that that place would have fallen if it had not been\r\nfor the courage and military capacity shown by Wurantai, leader of the\r\nCanton Bannermen. This soldier fully realised the perils of the\r\nsituation. In a memorial to the Throne he spoke plainly:--\r\n\r\n     \"The outer barbarians (Europeans) say that of literature China\r\n     has more than enough, of the art of war not sufficient. The whole\r\n     country swarms with the rebels. Our funds are nearly at an end,\r\n     and our troops few; our officers disagree, and the power is not\r\n     concentrated. The commander of the forces wants to extinguish a\r\n     burning wagon-load of fagots with a cupful of water. I fear we\r\n     shall hereafter have some serious affair--that the great body\r\n     will rise against us, and our own people leave us.\"\r\n\r\nThe growth of the rebellion proved steady if slow. Although 30,000\r\ntroops were stated to be concentrated opposite the Taeping positions,\r\nfear or inexperience prevented action, and the numbers and courage of\r\nthe Imperialists melted away. Had the Chinese authorities only pressed\r\non, they must, by sheer weight, have swept the rebels into Tonquin,\r\nand there would thus have been an end of Tien Wang and his\r\naspirations. They lacked the nerve, and their vacillation gave\r\nconfidence and reputation to an enemy that need never have been\r\nallowed to become formidable.\r\n\r\nWhile the Imperial authorities had been either discouraged or at the\r\nleast lethargic, the pretender Tien Wang had been busily engaged in\r\nestablishing his authority on a sound basis, and in assigning their\r\nrespective ranks to his principal followers who saw in the conferring\r\nof titles and posts, at the moment of little meaning or value, the\r\nrecognition of their past zeal and the promise of reward for future\r\nservice. The men who rallied round Tien Wang were schoolmasters and\r\nlabourers. To these some brigands of the mountain frontier supplied\r\nrude military knowledge, while the leaders of the Triads brought as\r\ntheir share towards the realisation of what they represented as a\r\ngreat cause skill in intrigue, and some knowledge of organisation.\r\nNeither enthusiasm nor the energy of desperation was wanting; but for\r\nthose qualities which claim respect, if they cannot command success,\r\nwe must look in vain. Yet the peasants of Kwangsi and the artisans of\r\nKwantung assumed the title of \"Wang\" or prince, and divided in\r\nanticipation the prizes that should follow the establishment of some\r\ndynasty of their own making.\r\n\r\nThe war dragged on in the Sikiang valley during two years, but the\r\ntide of success had certainly set in the main against the\r\nImperialists, as was shown by the scene of operations being\r\ntransferred to the northern side of that river. The campaign might\r\nhave continued indefinitely until one side or the other was exhausted\r\nhad not the state of the province warned Tien Wang that he could not\r\nhope to feed much longer the numerous followers who had attached\r\nthemselves to his cause. He saw that there would very soon remain for\r\nhim no choice except to retire into Tonquin, and to settle down into\r\nthe ignominious life of a border brigand. To Tien Wang the thought was\r\nintolerable, and in sheer desperation he came to the resolve to march\r\nnorthwards into the interior of China. It was not the inspiration of\r\ngenius but the pressure of dire need that urged the Taeping leader to\r\nissue his orders for the invasion of Hoonan. He issued a proclamation\r\non the eve of beginning this march, announcing that he had received\r\n\"the divine commission to exterminate the Manchus and to possess the\r\nEmpire as its true sovereign.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at this stage in the rebellion that the name \"Taepings\" came\r\ninto general use, and various accounts are given as to its origin.\r\nSome say it was taken from the small town of that name in the\r\nsouth-west of Kwangsi, where the insurrection began; others that the\r\ncharacters mean \"Universal Peace,\" and that it was the style assumed\r\nby the new dynasty. In seeming contradiction with this is the fact\r\nthat some of the Taepings themselves declared that they never heard\r\nthe name, and did not know what it meant. At this particular juncture\r\nthe rebels were in the heart of Kwangsi, at the district capital of\r\nWoosuen. In May 1851 they moved to Siang, a little north of that\r\nplace. They ravaged the country, making no long stay anywhere. In\r\nAugust they were at Yungan, where 16,000 men were ranged under the\r\nbanner of the Heavenly King, and for a moment Tien Wang may have\r\nthought of making a dash on Canton. Respect for Wurantai's military\r\ncapacity induced him to forego the adventure, and at Yungan, where he\r\nremained until April 1852, the Taeping leader made his final\r\narrangements for his march northwards.\r\n\r\nAt Yungan a circumstance occurred which first promised to strengthen\r\nthe Taepings, and then to lead to their disruption. Tien Wang was\r\njoined there by five influential chiefs and many members of the Triad\r\nSociety. For a time it seemed as if these allies would necessarily\r\nbring with them a great accession of popular strength; but whether\r\nthey disapproved of Tien Wang's plans, or were offended by the\r\narrogant bearing of the Wangs, who, but the other day little better\r\nthan the dregs of the people, had suddenly assumed the yellow dress\r\nand insignia of Chinese royalty, the Triad leaders took a secret and\r\nhurried departure from his camp, and hastened to make their peace with\r\nthe Imperialists. The principal of these members of the most\r\nformidable secret society in China--Chang Kwoliang by name--was given\r\na military command of some importance, and afterwards distinguished\r\nhimself among the Imperial commanders. In April 1852 the Taeping army\r\nleft its quarters at Yungan and marched direct on Kweiling, the\r\nprincipal city of the province, where the Imperial commissioners sent\r\nfrom Peking had long remained inactive. Tien Wang attacked them at the\r\nend of April or the beginning of May, but he was repulsed with some\r\nloss. Afraid of breaking his force against the walls of so strong a\r\nplace, he abandoned the attack and marched into Hoonan. Had the\r\nImperial generals only been as energetic in offensive measures as they\r\nhad shown themselves obstinate in defence, they might have harassed\r\nhis rear, delayed his progress, and eventually brought him to a\r\ndecisive engagement under many disadvantages. But the Imperial\r\nCommissioners at Kweiling did nothing, being apparently well satisfied\r\nwith having rid themselves of the presence of such troublesome\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nOn 12th of June the Taepings attacked the small town of Taou in Hoonan\r\nwith better success. Some resistance was offered, and one of the\r\nTaeping Wangs, known as the \"Southern King,\" was killed. This was a\r\ngreat loss, because he was a man of some education, and had taken the\r\nmost prominent part in the organisation of the Taeping rebellion.\r\nGeneral Gordon inclined to the opinion that he was the real originator\r\nof the whole rising. His loss was a severe blow to the Taepings, whose\r\nconfidence in themselves and their cause was alike rudely shaken. They\r\ncould not however turn back, for fear of the force at Kweiling, and to\r\nhalt for any time was scarcely less dangerous. Necessity compelled\r\nthem therefore to press on, and in August they captured the three\r\nsmall towns of Kiaho, Ching, and Kweyang. Their next march was both\r\nlong and forced. Overrunning the whole adjacent country, they appeared\r\nearly in the month of September before the strong and important town\r\nof Changsha, situated on the river Seang, and only fifty miles south\r\nof the large lake Tungting.\r\n\r\nAt this town, the capital of Hoonan, some vigorous preparations had\r\nbeen made to withstand them. Not merely was the usual garrison\r\nstationed there, but it so happened that Tseng Kwofan, a man of great\r\nability and some considerable resolution, was residing near the town\r\nat the time. Tseng Kwofan had held several offices in the service, and\r\nas a member of the Hanlin enjoyed a high position and reputation; but\r\nhe was absent from the capital on one of those frequent periods of\r\nretirement to their native province which the officials of China have\r\nto make on the occasion of any near relative's death.\r\n\r\nWhen tidings of the approach of the Taepings reached him he threw\r\nhimself with all the forces he could collect into Changsha. At the\r\nsame time he ordered the local militia to assemble as rapidly as\r\npossible in the neighbourhood, in order to harass the movements of the\r\nenemy. He called upon all those who had the means to show their duty\r\nto the state and sovereign by raising recruits or by promising rewards\r\nto those volunteers who would serve in the army against the rebels.\r\nHad the example of Tseng Kwofan been followed generally, it is not too\r\nmuch to say that the Taepings would never have got to Nanking. As it\r\nwas, he set the first example of true patriotism, and he had the\r\nimmediate satisfaction of saving Changsha.\r\n\r\nWhen the Taepings reached Changsha they found the gates closed and the\r\nwalls manned. They proceeded to lay siege to it; they cut off its\r\nsupplies, and they threatened the garrison with extermination. They\r\neven attempted to carry it by storm on three separate occasions.\r\nDuring eighty days the siege went on; but the Taepings were then\r\ncompelled to admit that they were as far from success as ever. They\r\nhad suffered very considerable losses, including another of their\r\nWangs, the Western King, and although it was said that the loss of the\r\nImperialists was larger, they could better afford it. On the 1st\r\nDecember they accordingly abandoned the siege and resumed their march\r\nnorthwards. They crossed the Tungting Lake on boats and junks which\r\nthey had seized, and secured the town of Yochow on the Yangtsekiang\r\nwithout meeting any resistance. Here they captured much war material,\r\nincluding a large supply of gunpowder left by the great Chinese\r\nViceroy, Wou Sankwei, of the seventeenth century. From Yochow they\r\nhastened down the river. The important city of Hankow surrendered\r\nwithout a blow. The not less important town of Wouchang, on the\r\nopposite or southern bank of the river, was then attacked, and after a\r\nsiege of a fortnight carried by storm. The third town of Hanyang,\r\nwhich completes the busy human hive where the Han joins the great\r\nriver, did not attempt any resistance.\r\n\r\nThese successes raised the Taepings from the depths of despair to the\r\nheights of hope. The capture of such wealthy places dispelled all\r\ntheir doubt and discouragement. They were able to repay themselves for\r\nthe losses and hardships they had undergone, and the prize they had\r\nthus secured furnished ground for hoping for more. But even now it was\r\nno part of their mission to stand still. They waited at Hankow only\r\nlong enough to attach to their cause the many thousands attracted to\r\nTien Wang's flag by these successes. The possibility of pursuit by\r\nTseng Kwofan at the head of the warlike levies of Hoonan, where each\r\nbrave is considered equal to two from another province, was still\r\npresent to their minds. But he unfortunately rested content with his\r\nlaurels, while the Taepings swept like an irresistible wave or torrent\r\ndown the valley of the Yangtsekiang.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Kiukiang, a town situated on the river near the\r\nnorthern extremity of the lake Poyang, and of Ganking followed in\r\nquick succession, and on 8th March the Taepings sat down before\r\nNanking, the old capital of the Mings. The siege lasted only sixteen\r\ndays. Notwithstanding that there was a considerable Manchu force in\r\nthe Tartar city, which might easily have been defended apart from the\r\nChinese and much larger town, the resistance offered was singularly\r\nfaint-hearted. The Taepings succeeded in blowing in one of the gates.\r\nThe townspeople fraternised with the assailants, and the very Manchus,\r\nwho had looked so valiant in face of Sir Hugh Gough's force ten years\r\nbefore, now surrendered their lives and their honour after a mere show\r\nof resistance to a force which was nothing better than an armed\r\nrabble. The Manchu colony of Nanking, to the number of some 4000\r\nfamilies, had evidently fallen off from its high renown. Instead of\r\ndying at their posts, they threw themselves on the pity of the Taeping\r\nleader. Their cowardice helped them not; of 20,000 Manchus not 100\r\nescaped. The tale rests on irrefragable evidence. \"We killed them all\r\nto the infant in arms; we left not a root to sprout from; and the\r\nbodies of the slain we cast into the Yangtse.\"\r\n\r\nThe capture of Nanking and this sweeping massacre of the dominant race\r\nseemed to point the inevitable finger of fate at the Tatsing dynasty.\r\nIt was no longer possible to regard Tien Wang and his miscellaneous\r\ngathering as an enemy beneath contempt. Without achieving any\r\nremarkable success, having indeed been defeated whenever they were\r\nopposed with the least resolution, the Taepings found themselves in\r\npossession of the second city in the Empire. With that city they\r\nacquired the control of the navigation of the Great River, and they\r\ncut off the better part of the communications between the northern and\r\nsouthern halves of the Empire. They abandoned Hankow, and confined\r\ntheir occupation of the river banks to the part between Kiukiang and\r\nNanking; but they determined to secure the Grand Canal, which enters\r\nthe river east of the city. On 1st April 1853 they occupied\r\nChinkiangfoo, on the southern side of the river, and they held it, but\r\nalthough they also captured Yangchow on the northern bank, they\r\nevacuated it in a few days. These successes were obtained without any\r\nloss, as all the garrisons fled at the mere approach of the dreaded\r\nTaepings.\r\n\r\nThe Imperialist authorities seemed paralysed by the rapidity and\r\nsuccess of the rebels, who devoted all their efforts to strengthening\r\nthe defences of Nanking and to provisioning it in view of all\r\neventualities. But the thoughts of Tien Wang and his immediate\r\nadvisers were still of offensive and forward measures, and when\r\nNanking was equipped for defence a large part of the Taeping army was\r\nordered to march against Peking. At this time it was computed that the\r\ntotal number of the Taepings did not fall short of 80,000 trustworthy\r\nfighting men, while there were perhaps more than 100,000 Chinese\r\npressed into their service as hewers of wood and drawers of water. The\r\nlines of Nanking and the batteries along the Yangtsekiang were the\r\ncreation of the forced labour of the population which had not fled\r\nbefore the Taepings.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of May an army, stated to consist of 200,000 men, but\r\nprobably consisting of less than half that number of combatants,\r\ncrossed the Yangtse and marched northwards. It would be uninteresting\r\nto name the many small places they captured on their way, but on 19th\r\nJune they reached Kaifong, the capital of Honan, and once of China\r\nitself. They had thus transferred in a few weeks their advanced posts\r\nfrom the Yangtsekiang to the Hwangho, or Yellow River.\r\n\r\nThe garrison of Kaifong made a resolute defence, and repulsed the\r\nTaepings, who at once abandoned the siege in accordance with their\r\nusual custom, and resumed their march. They succeeded in crossing the\r\nYellow River under the eyes of the Kaifong garrison, and they then\r\nattacked Hwaiking, an important prefectural town, where they\r\nencountered a stout resistance. They besieged it for two months, and\r\nthen had to give up the attempt. Forces were gathering from different\r\ndirections, and it became necessary to baffle their opponents. They\r\nmarched westwards for some distance along the southern bank of the\r\nHwangho, turned suddenly north at Yuenking, and on reaching Pingyang\r\nthey again turned in an easterly direction, and secured the Lin\r\nLimming Pass which leads into the Metropolitan province of Pechihli.\r\nThe whole of the autumn of 1853 was taken up with these manoeuvres,\r\nand it was on 30th September that the Taepings first appeared in the\r\nprovince containing the capital. They met with little or no\r\nopposition. They had mystified their pursuers, and surprised the\r\ninhabitants of the districts through which they passed. Having forced\r\nthe Limming Pass, the Taepings found no difficulty in occupying the\r\ntowns on the south-west border of Pechihli. The defeat of the Manchu\r\ngarrison in a pass that was considered almost impregnable gave the\r\nTaepings the prestige of victory, and the towns opened their gates one\r\nafter another. They crossed the Hootoo River on a bridge of boats\r\nwhich they constructed themselves, and then occupied the town of\r\nShinchow; on 21st October they reached Tsing, about twenty miles south\r\nof Tientsin and only one hundred from Peking; but beyond this point\r\nneither then nor at any other time did the rebels succeed in getting.\r\n\r\nThe forcing of the Limming Pass produced great confusion at Peking. It\r\nwas no longer a question of suffering subjects and disturbed\r\nprovinces. The capital of the Empire, the very person of the Emperor,\r\nwas in imminent danger of destruction at the hands of a ruthless foe.\r\nThe city was denuded of troops. Levies were hastily summoned from\r\nManchuria in order to defend the line of the Peiho and the approaches\r\nto the capital. Had the Taepings shown better generalship there is no\r\nsaying but that they would have succeeded in capturing it, as the\r\nImperialists had left quite unguarded the approach by Chingting and\r\nPaoting, and the capture of Peking would have sounded the knell of the\r\nManchu dynasty. But the Taepings did not seize the chance--if it were\r\none--and they were far from being in the best of spirits. They had\r\nadvanced far, but it looked as if it was into the lion's mouth. Their\r\nmarch had been a remarkable one, but it had been attended with no\r\nstriking success. In their front was the Tientsin militia,\r\nstrengthened by a large if nondescript force, led by the Mongol chief\r\nSankolinsin. In their rear the levies of Hoonan, of the vast district\r\nthat had suffered from their exactions, were closing up, and soon they\r\nwere closely beleaguered in a hastily-fortified camp at Tsinghai. In\r\nthis they were besieged from the end of October to the beginning of\r\nMarch 1854. The Imperial generals, afraid to risk an assault, hoped to\r\nstarve them out, and so they might have done had not Tien Wang sent a\r\nfresh army to extricate this force from its peril. Then the retreat\r\nbegan, but, beset by assailants from every side, it was slow and\r\ndisastrous. The struggle went on until March 1855, when Sankolinsin\r\nwas able to declare that not a Taeping remained north of the Yellow\r\nRiver. Only a very small portion of the two armies sent to capture\r\nPeking ever returned to the headquarters of Tien Wang.\r\n\r\nWhile these events, and others that do not call for description as\r\nbeing of minor importance, were in progress, symptoms of\r\ndisintegration were already beginning to reveal themselves in the camp\r\nat Nanking. After its capture Tien Wang himself retired into the\r\ninterior of his palace and never afterwards appeared in public. All\r\nhis time was passed in the harem, and the opportunity was thus given\r\nhis more ambitious lieutenants to assert themselves. Tung Wang, the\r\n\"Eastern King,\" became principal Minister. He, too, claimed to have\r\ncommunion with Heaven, and on celestial advice he began to get rid of\r\nthose of his comrades who opposed his schemes. He even summoned Tien\r\nWang to his presence and reproved him for his proceedings. A plot was\r\nthen formed against Tung Wang, and he was slain with three of his\r\nbrothers, in the presence of Tien Wang, by another of the Taeping\r\nchiefs. Nor did the slaughter stop there, for it is alleged, although\r\nthe numbers must not be accepted literally, that 200,000 of his\r\npartisans--men, women, and children--were massacred. These internal\r\ndissensions threatened to break up the Taeping confederacy, and no\r\ndoubt they would have done so but for the appearance of the most\r\nremarkable man associated with the movement, and one of the most\r\nheroic figures in China's history.\r\n\r\nA young officer, rejoicing in the innumerable Chinese name of Li, had\r\nattracted Tung Wang's favourable notice, and was by him entrusted with\r\na small command. It will be more convenient to speak of him by his\r\nsubsequent title of Chung Wang, or the \"Faithful King.\" He\r\ndistinguished himself in his first enterprise by defeating a large\r\nImperial army besieging Chinkiang, and in relieving the garrison when\r\non the point of surrender. But while engaged on this task the\r\nImperialists closed in on his rear and cut off his retreat back to\r\nNanking, whither Tien Wang hastily summoned him to return. He\r\nendeavoured to make his way along the northern bank, but was checked\r\nat Loohoo by the ex-Triad Chang Kwoliang, the same who deserted the\r\nTaepings in Kwangsi. Chang had crossed the river to oppose him, and\r\nChung Wang, hastily conveying his army over the river, fell upon and\r\ndestroyed the weakened force that the Imperial general had left there,\r\nunder General Chi, who committed suicide. Chang Kwoliang crossed after\r\nhim, but only to suffer defeat, and Chung Wang made his way into\r\nNanking. He then attacked the main Imperial army before its walls,\r\nunder the Emperor's generalissimo Heang Yung, and drove it out of its\r\nentrenchments. Heang took his defeat so much to heart that he also\r\ncommitted suicide, but Chang Kwoliang made a supreme effort to\r\nretrieve the day, and succeeded in retaking all the lost positions,\r\nwith the exception of the Yashua Gate of Nanking.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were in progress in the Taeping capital, some\r\nevents that must be briefly referred to happened on a different scene.\r\nThe Triads, aided by the mob, rose in Shanghai, overcame the Emperor's\r\nofficers and garrison, and on 7th September 1853 obtained complete\r\nmastery of the native city. The foreign settlement was placed in a\r\nstate of siege, the men-of-war covered the approaches to the\r\nfactories, and a volunteer corps was carefully organised and\r\nconstantly employed. Then an Imperial army re-appeared on the scene,\r\nand laid siege to Shanghai, but it was conducted with no skill, and\r\nthe situation remained unchanged. After twelve months' delay the\r\nFrench Admiral, Laguerre, decided to help the Imperialists, and he\r\nbegan to bombard the walls in December 1854. He combined with them in\r\nan assault, and 400 French sailors and the Imperialists attacked the\r\nwalls which had been breached. The assault ended disastrously, for the\r\nrebels defended the houses, and at last drove back the assailants with\r\nmuch loss. The pressure of famine compelled the besieged some months\r\nlater to make a _sortie_, when the Imperialists recovered the town. A\r\nsimilar rising, with a similar result, occurred at Amoy. The\r\ninsurgents caused a great loss of life and property, but in the end\r\nthe authorities gained the upper hand. These events compelled the\r\nforeign consuls and their Governments to reconsider their policy,\r\nwhich had been one of sympathy towards the Taepings, and gradually the\r\nconviction became universal that it would be well for civilization and\r\ntrade if a speedy end were put to the Taeping rebellion. But for our\r\nown quarrel and war with the central Government these views would have\r\nborne fruit in acts at an earlier date than they did.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign of 1858 the Taepings more than held their own\r\nthrough the courage and activity shown by Chung Wang. He relieved the\r\ntown of Ganking when closely pressed by Tseng Kwofan, and although he\r\ncould not prevent a fresh beleaguerment of Nanking, it caused him no\r\napprehension because the Emperor's generals were well known to have no\r\nintention of attacking. Notwithstanding this, it was clearly foreseen\r\nthat in time Nanking must fall by starvation. In these straits Chung\r\nWang proved the saviour of his party. The city was invested on three\r\nsides; only one remained open for any one to carry out the news of\r\nTien Wang's necessities. In this moment of peril there was a general\r\nreluctance to quit the besieged town, but unless someone did, and that\r\nquickly, the place was doomed. In this supreme moment Chung Wang\r\noffered to go himself. At first the proposal was received with a\r\nchorus of disapproval, but at last, when he went to the door of Tien\r\nWang's palace and beat the gong which lay there for those who claimed\r\njustice, he succeeded in overcoming the opposition to his plan, and in\r\nimpressing upon his audience the real gravity of the situation. His\r\nrequest was granted, and having nominated trusty men to the command\r\nduring his absence, he left by the southern gate. A few days later and\r\nTseng's last levies constructed their fortified camp in front of it.\r\nThe Emperor's generals unfortunately reverted to their old dilatory\r\nmeasures, because they failed to realise the importance with which the\r\npossession of Nanking still invested the Taepings. Without that city\r\nthey would have been nothing but a band of brigands, who could easily\r\nhave been dispersed. With it they could claim the status of a separate\r\ndynasty. Yet the capture of Nanking was put off until the last act of\r\nall. These sapient leaders, whose military knowledge was antiquated,\r\nacted with an indifference to the most obvious considerations, that\r\nwould have been ludicrous if it had not been a further injury to a\r\nsuffering people. In 1858 their apathy was such that it not merely\r\nsaved Nanking but played the whole game into the hands of Chung Wang.\r\n\r\nThat chief succeeded in collecting a small force, with which he at\r\nonce began to harass Tseng's army. By transferring his army rapidly\r\nfrom one side of the river to the other, he succeeded in supplying his\r\ndeficiency in numbers; but with all his activity he could make no\r\nimpression on the mass of his opponents. He even got the worst of it\r\nin several skirmishes, but by a supreme effort he succeeded in\r\noverpowering the Imperial force north of the river at Poukou, and thus\r\nrelieved the pressure on Nanking. But this was only momentary, and\r\nafter a doubtful and wearisome campaign throughout the year 1859, the\r\nsituation again became one of great gravity for the besieged Taepings\r\nwho were now confined to Nanking and a few other towns in the Yangtse\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nIn this extremity Chung Wang conceived a fresh plan for extricating\r\nhis cause from the difficulties that beset it. By January 1860 all\r\nChung Wang's arrangements were completed. He distributed considerable\r\nsums of money among his men to put them in good humour, and then set\r\nforth. His first movements were directed to misleading his enemy as to\r\nhis real object, and having succeeded in this he marched as rapidly as\r\npossible towards the important harbour of Hangchow, in the bay of the\r\nsame name, south of Shanghai. On 19th March he succeeded in capturing\r\nthe Chinese city, but the Tartar portion held out, and a relieving\r\narmy compelled Chung Wang to retire. What seemed an unredeemed\r\ncalamity proved a stroke of good fortune, for the Imperialists had\r\nsent their best troops to pursue him, and thus materially weakened the\r\nforce before Nanking. Chung Wang saw his chance, and while the\r\nImperialists were rejoicing in Hangchow at its recovery, he hastened\r\nback by forced marches, and fell upon the besieging army. In the\r\ndesperate engagement that followed 5000 Imperialists were slain, and\r\nthe remainder were driven ignominiously from the field. Thus, at the\r\nblackest moment of their fortunes, did Chung Wang succeed in\r\ndelivering his kinsmen who had so long been shut up in Nanking. This\r\nsiege had then continued with more or less interruption for seven\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nNor did Chung Wang's success stop here. He fought a battle at Tayan\r\nwith his old adversary Chang Kwoliang, and defeated him with a loss of\r\n10,000 men. At the height of the engagement Chang Kwoliang was drowned\r\nwhile crossing a canal, and this decided the battle. Encouraged by\r\nthese successes, and with increased forces--for most of the prisoners\r\nhe took were incorporated in his army--Chung Wang assumed the\r\noffensive, and after winning no fewer than three regular engagements,\r\nhe succeeded in capturing the important city of Soochow, on the Grand\r\nCanal, and this became his chief quarters during the remainder of this\r\nlong struggle. By these successes he obtained fresh supplies, and\r\ncommanded the great and hitherto little touched resources of the\r\nwealthy province of Kiangsu. It was thus that he was brought into the\r\nneighbourhood of Shanghai, and made those attempts to acquire\r\npossession of the Chinese city which were set forth in the last\r\nchapter, and which were the true cause of the inception of the\r\nforeign, or foreign-trained force, that began with Ward.\r\n\r\nAfter his repulse at Shanghai, Chung Wang was recalled to Nanking. He\r\nwent reluctantly, leaving Hoo Wang, \"the Protecting King,\" as his\r\ndeputy at Soochow. He found there everything in confusion, and that\r\nTien Wang, instead of laying in rice for a fresh siege, was absorbed\r\nin his devotion and amusements, while the other chiefs were engaged in\r\nplundering their own subjects. Dissatisfied with what he saw at\r\nNanking, Chung Wang again took the field, and transferred the scene of\r\nhostilities to the province of Kiangsi, but although he showed great\r\nactivity, and marched 800 miles, he gained little, and, indeed, was\r\ndefeated on one or two occasions. Nor could he save Ganking, which,\r\nafter being besieged for three years, surrendered to Tseng Kwotsiuen,\r\nand thus all hope of succour from the west, or of retreat there, in\r\nthe last resort, was removed from the hard-beset garrison of Nanking.\r\nAs some set-off to this reverse, Chung Wang captured the ports of\r\nNingpo and Hangchow, after a gallant defence by a small Manchu\r\ngarrison. The Taepings could scarcely now hope for durable success,\r\nbut their capacity for inflicting an enormous amount of injury was\r\nevidently not destroyed. Chung Wang's energy and military skill alone\r\nsustained their cause, but the lovers of rapine and turbulence flocked\r\nin their thousands to his standard.\r\n\r\nIn the Yangtse valley--in fact, wherever Chung Wang was not--the\r\nTaepings met with many reverses that counterbalanced these successes.\r\nSeveral Chinese armies approached Nanking from different sides, and\r\nTien Wang in a state of panic summoned Chung Wang, his only champion,\r\nback to his side. That warrior obeyed the summons, leaving Mow Wang in\r\ncharge of Soochow, but he could do no good. He found nothing but\r\ndisorder at the Taeping capital, and no troops with which he could\r\nventure to assume the offensive against the powerful army, in numbers\r\nat all events, that the two Tsengs had drawn round Nanking. In this\r\nposition his troubles were increased by the suspicion of Tien Wang,\r\nwho deprived him of all his honours, and banished him to the province\r\nof Anhui, adjacent to both Kiangsi and Kiangsu, and joined with them\r\nin the same viceroyalty. This order to depart was a relief to Chung\r\nWang, who was thus able to complete his own measures for the defence\r\nof Soochow and the other places along the Canal that had fallen to his\r\narms. He saw clearly that the success of the foreigners in keeping him\r\nback at a distance of thirty miles from Shanghai, and in expelling him\r\nfrom Ningpo, signified his being shut in just as effectively on the\r\neast, as he already was on the west by the fall of every place except\r\nNanking, and by the miserable inefficiency of the garrison in that\r\nplace. He may have really despaired, but this Chinese Frederick was\r\nresolved, if he could, to break his chains. Unfortunately for him, a\r\nnew and more formidable antagonist than any he had met appeared on the\r\nscene at this juncture, in the person of Gordon.\r\n\r\nThis summary of the progress and nature of the Taeping rebellion up to\r\nthe 25th March 1863 when Gordon assumed the command will make clear\r\nwhat follows to the general reader. It would be as great a mistake to\r\nminimise the fighting military strength of the Taepings as it would be\r\nto exaggerate it. There was a moment, years before Gordon came on the\r\nscene, when the Imperial commanders by a little energy and promptitude\r\nmight have stamped out the rebellion; but having missed the\r\nopportunity the military skill and daring of Chung Wang had revived\r\nthe Taeping cause, and made it more formidable than ever from a\r\nmilitary point of view. The blunders of the Imperial commanders\r\nprecluded any confidence as to their superior numbers and resources\r\neffecting their natural result, and although Gordon himself declared\r\nthat the Taeping cause was a lost one before he assumed the command,\r\nno cause could be pronounced irretrievable with a leader so expert and\r\nresolute as Chung Wang, and opponents so incapable and craven as his\r\nwere. But another thing was certainly incontestable, and that was that\r\nthe Taepings could not in any sense be regarded as patriots. Their\r\nregular mode of conduct stamped them at once as undiscriminating\r\nplunderers of all, whether Chinese or Manchu, who had the misfortune\r\nto fall into their hands, and their acts of cruelty surpassed\r\ndescription and even belief. Some instances of the massacres they\r\nperpetrated have been mentioned, but these were only a few out of the\r\nmany that stained, or rather characterised, their usual proceedings.\r\nIt will suffice to say that their ordinary way of dealing with their\r\nprisoners was to crucify them, and there will then be no difficulty in\r\naccepting the conclusion that the Chinese population thoroughly\r\ndetested them, and regarded them as a scourge rather than as\r\ndeliverers.\r\n\r\nNor does a closer examination of the system of administration set up\r\nat Nanking by the leader Tien Wang raise one's opinion of the cause or\r\nits promoters. The foreign missionaries long thought that the Taepings\r\nwere the agents of Christianity, and that their success would lead to\r\nthe conversion of China. That faith died hard, but at last in 1860 a\r\nmissionary had to confess that after visiting Nanking \"he could find\r\nnothing of Christianity but its name falsely applied to a system of\r\nrevolting idolatry,\" and out of that and other irresistible testimony\r\nresulted the conclusion that the conversion of China by the agency of\r\nthe Taepings was a delusion. The missionaries were not alone in their\r\nbelief among foreigners. The Consuls and their Governments entertained\r\na hope that the Taepings might establish an administration which would\r\nbe less difficult to deal with than they had found the existing one at\r\nPeking. They attempted to, and did in an informal manner, establish\r\nsome relations with Tien Wang. They acquainted him with the articles\r\nof the Treaty of Tientsin, and they requested him to conform with its\r\nconditions. On a second occasion Sir George Bonham, our head\r\nrepresentative in China, even honoured him with a visit; but closer\r\nacquaintance in the case of our diplomatists, as of the missionaries,\r\nstripped the Taepings of the character with which interested persons\r\nwould wish they had been invested. From the first feeling of\r\nfriendship and sympathy there consequently ensued a slow but steady\r\nrevulsion, until at last the general feeling was that the Taepings\r\nwere little more than marauders, and as such a scourge to the country\r\nand a standing injury to the trade and interests of Europeans. Then\r\ncame the desire to see the rising suppressed, and finally the\r\ndisillusionment culminated in active measures being taken to assist\r\nthe Imperial Government in suppressing a rebellion which had defied\r\nall its efforts for more than ten years. Of these measures the\r\nappointment of Major Gordon to the command of the Ever Victorious Army\r\nwas both the last and the most effectual in producing the desired\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE EVER VICTORIOUS ARMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appointment of any English officer would have led to some\r\nimprovement in the direction of the Chinese Imperial forces assembled\r\nfor the suppression of the Taeping rebellion; but the nature of the\r\noperations to be carried out, which were exclusively the capture of a\r\nnumber of towns strongly stockaded and protected by rivers and canals,\r\nrendered it specially necessary that that officer should be an\r\nengineer. In addition to the advantages of his scientific training,\r\nMajor Gordon enjoyed the benefit of the preliminary course he had gone\r\nthrough under General Staveley. He had seen the Taepings fight, and\r\nsomething also of the defence and capture of their positions. He had\r\nalso thoroughly mastered the topographical features of the region in\r\nand beyond which he was about to conduct military operations. There is\r\nlittle doubt that he assumed the command with a plan of campaign\r\nalready decided upon in his brain. The Taepings with whom he had to\r\ndeal derived their power and importance from the possession of\r\nSoochow, and from their access to several ports whence they obtained\r\narms and ammunition. Therefore the capture of that city and the\r\ncutting off of their supplies represented his principal objects. Very\r\nmuch had to be accomplished before Soochow could be even approached,\r\nand the main object of Gordon's first campaign was the capture of\r\nQuinsan, which he saw would be far more suitable as headquarters for\r\nhim and his force than the existing one at Sungkiang. Even before that\r\ncould be attempted many matters had to be arranged. Not only had Major\r\nGordon to relieve more than one beleaguered loyal garrison, but he had\r\nto establish his authority over his own force, which was on the verge\r\nof mutiny and clamouring for the return of Burgevine. His own opinion\r\nof that force was given in the following letter to a military\r\nfriend:--\r\n\r\n     \"I hope you do not think that I have a magnificent army. You\r\n     never did see such a rabble as it was; and although I think I\r\n     have improved it, it is still sadly wanting. Now both officers\r\n     and men, although ragged and perhaps slightly disreputable, are\r\n     in capital order and well disposed.\"\r\n\r\nBefore entering on these matters the following letter to his mother\r\nwill be read with interest, as showing what was in Gordon's mind at\r\nthe time he assumed the command. The letter was written on 24th March\r\n1863, the day before he rode over to Sungkiang to take up his command.\r\n\r\n     \"I am afraid you will be much vexed at my having taken the\r\n     command of the Sungkiang force, and that I am now a mandarin. I\r\n     have taken the step on consideration. I think that anyone who\r\n     contributes to putting down this rebellion fulfils a humane task,\r\n     and I also think tends a great deal to open China to\r\n     civilization. I will not act rashly, and I trust to be able soon\r\n     to return to England; at the same time, I will remember your and\r\n     my father's wishes, and endeavour to remain as short a time as\r\n     possible. I can say that, if I had not accepted the command, I\r\n     believe the force would have been broken up and the rebellion\r\n     gone on in its misery for years. I trust this will not now be the\r\n     case, and that I may soon be able to comfort you on this subject.\r\n     You must not fret on this matter. I think I am doing a good\r\n     service.... I keep your likeness before me, and can assure you\r\n     and my father that I will not be rash, and that as soon as I can\r\n     conveniently, and with due regard to the object I have in view, I\r\n     will return home.\"\r\n\r\nMajor Gordon rode over to Sungkiang, situated on the line of the\r\nthirty-mile radius from Shanghai, on 25th March, and the following\r\nmorning he inspected his force. He delivered a brief address, stating\r\nthat there was no intention to dismiss any of them, and that so long\r\nas they behaved well he would carefully uphold their rights and\r\ninterests. These words had a tranquillising effect, and Major Gordon's\r\nassumption of the command might be described as being then ratified by\r\nthe Ever Victorious Army. The good he effected was very nearly undone\r\ntwo days later by the civil magistrate hanging some soldiers for\r\nmarauding. After the affair looked like becoming serious, Gordon\r\nsucceeded in pacifying his men and restoring order. In this state of\r\naffairs it was most desirable that no time should be lost in resuming\r\nactive operations, and the Taeping successes at Taitsan and Fushan\r\nrendered them doubly necessary.\r\n\r\nThe first task entrusted to Major Gordon was the relief of Chanzu,\r\nwhich was closely assailed by the Taepings and believed to be on the\r\npoint of surrendering. Chanzu lies some distance south of Fushan and\r\nwest of Taitsan, and its garrison at this time was composed of\r\nTaepings who had deserted their comrades and joined the Imperial\r\nforces. Several attempts had been made to relieve it, but without\r\nsuccess, and Gordon was urged by his Chinese colleagues to signalise\r\nhis assumption of the command by carrying out this most desirable and\r\nnecessary task. The best means of approaching it was by the river, and\r\non 31st March Gordon accordingly sailed from Shanghai to the mouth of\r\nthe Fushan Creek. His force numbered about 1200 men, and included 200\r\nartillery with four 12-pounders and one 32-pounder. The enemy had\r\nconstructed some stockades at Fushan, outside the ruined city of that\r\nname, and Gordon attacked these on the 4th April. He began with a\r\nheavy bombardment, and when he ordered the advance the Taepings,\r\ndisheartened by his fire, evacuated their positions and retired with\r\nvery little loss to either side. Gordon then marched on Chanzu, ten\r\nmiles south of Fushan, and reached it without further fighting. The\r\nrelief of Chanzu being thus effected, Gordon hastened back to\r\nSungkiang, where he arrived little more than a week after he left it.\r\nThe success and swiftness of this movement greatly impressed Li Hung\r\nChang, who publicly recorded his great satisfaction at the very\r\ndifferent manner in which the new commander transacted business from\r\nBurgevine.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the British Consul at Shanghai, Mr Markham, Li wrote:--\r\n\r\n     \"The officer Gordon having received command of the Ever\r\n     Victorious Army, having immediately on doing so proceeded to\r\n     Fushan, working day and night, having worked harmoniously with\r\n     the other generals there, having exerted himself and attacked\r\n     with success the walled city of Fushan and relieved Chanzu, and\r\n     at once returned to Sungkiang and organised his force for further\r\n     operations to sweep out the rebels, having proved himself\r\n     valiant, able, and honest, I have congratulated myself and\r\n     memorialised his Imperial Majesty to confer on him the dignity\r\n     and office of Tsung-ping (Brigadier-General), to enable me to\r\n     consider him as part of my command. Again, since Gordon has taken\r\n     the command, he has exerted himself to organise the force, and\r\n     though he has had but one month he has got the force into shape.\r\n     As the people and place are charmed with him, as he has already\r\n     given me returns of the organisation of the force, the formation\r\n     of each regiment, and the expenses ordinary and extraordinary in\r\n     the clearest manner, wishing to drill our troops and save our\r\n     money, it is evident that he fully comprehends the state of\r\n     affairs.\"\r\n\r\nOn his return to Sungkiang, Major Gordon devoted himself to the\r\nthorough reorganisation of his force. He began by abolishing the\r\nsystem of rewards for the capture of towns, and he forbade plundering\r\non pain of death. These were strong steps to take with a force such as\r\nthat he had under him, but he succeeded in making them acceptable by\r\nincreasing the pay of the men, and by substituting on his staff\r\nEnglish officers--the services of a few being lent him by the\r\ncommanding officer at Shanghai--for the adventurers who had followed\r\nWard and Burgevine. The total strength of the force was fixed at 4000\r\nmen, and his artillery consisted of four siege and two field\r\nbatteries. The men were paid regularly by a Chinese official appointed\r\nby Li Hung Chang, and the cost to the Chinese Government averaged\r\nL20,000 a month. At the same time, Gordon collected a pontoon train\r\nand practised his men in all the work of attacking fortified places\r\nbefore he ventured to assume the offensive. He also organised a\r\nflotilla of small steamers and Chinese gunboats capable of navigating\r\nthe canals and creeks which traversed the province of Kiangsu in all\r\ndirections. Of these the principal was the steamer _Hyson_--a\r\npaddle-wheel vessel drawing 3-1/2 feet of water, armed with a\r\n32-pounder in her bow, and a 12-pounder at her stern, and possessing\r\nthe faculty of moving over the bed of a creek on her wheels--and it\r\ntook a very active and prominent part in the subsequent operations.\r\n\r\nThe strategy on which Major Gordon at once decided, and from which he\r\nnever deviated, was to cut off the Taeping communications with the sea\r\nand the river Yangtsekiang, whence they were able to obtain supplies\r\nof ammunition and arms from little-scrupulous foreign traders. The\r\nexpulsion of the Taepings from the Shanghai district and from Ningpo\r\nhad done something towards the success of this project, but they still\r\nheld Hangchow and the line of the Yangtsekiang to within ten miles of\r\nthe entrance of the Woosung River on which Shanghai stands. The loss\r\nof Fushan and Chanzu had made an indent in this territory, and in\r\norder to complete this breach in the Taeping position, Gordon had\r\ndecided and made all his plans to attack Quinsan, when he was\r\ncompelled to defer it in consequence of the following incident.\r\n\r\nThe rude repulse at Taitsan had been, it will be recollected, the\r\nculminating misfortune of the force before Gordon's assumption of the\r\ncommand, but a Chinese army under Li Hung Chang's brother, San Tajin,\r\ncontinued to remain in the neighbourhood of the place. The Taeping\r\ncommander laid a trap for him, into which he fell in what was, for a\r\nChinese officer fully acquainted with the fact that treachery formed\r\npart of the usages of war in China, a very credulous manner. He\r\nexpressed a desire to come over, presents and vows were exchanged, and\r\nat a certain hour he was to surrender one of the gates. The Imperial\r\ntroops went to take possession, and were even admitted within the\r\nwalls, when they were suddenly attacked on both flanks by the\r\ntreacherous Taepings. Fifteen hundred of San Tajin's men were killed\r\nor captured, and he himself was severely wounded. In consequence of\r\nthis reverse, the main Chinese army, under General Ching, a brave but\r\ninexperienced officer, could not co-operate with Gordon against\r\nQuinsan, and it was then decided that Gordon himself should proceed\r\nagainst Taitsan, and read the triumphant foe at that place a lesson.\r\nIt was computed that its garrison numbered 10,000 men, and that it had\r\nseveral European deserters and renegades among its leaders, while the\r\ntotal force under Gordon did not exceed 3000 men. Their recent\r\nsuccesses had also inspired the Taepings with confidence, and, judging\r\nby the previous encounters, there seemed little reason to anticipate a\r\nsatisfactory, or at least a speedy issue of the affair for the\r\nImperialists. That the result was more favourable was entirely due to\r\nGordon's military capacity and genius.\r\n\r\nMajor Gordon acted with remarkable and characteristic promptitude. He\r\nonly heard of the catastrophe to San Tajin on 27th April; on 29th\r\nApril, after two forced marches across country, he appeared before\r\nTaitsan, and captured a stockade in front of one of its gates. Bad\r\nweather prevented operations the next day, but on 1st May, Gordon\r\nhaving satisfied himself by personal examination that the western gate\r\noffered the best point of attack, began the bombardment soon after\r\ndaybreak. Two stone stockades in front of the gate had first to be\r\ncarried, and these, after twenty minutes' firing, were evacuated on\r\npart of Gordon's force threatening the retreat of their garrison back\r\nto the town. The capture of these stockades began and ended the\r\noperations on that day. The next morning Gordon stationed one regiment\r\nin front of the north gate to cut off the retreat of the garrison in\r\nthat direction, and then resumed his main attack on the west gate. By\r\nthis time he had been joined by some of his gunboats, and their fire,\r\naided by the artillery he had with him, gradually made a good\r\nimpression on the wall, especially after the guns had been drawn as\r\nnear as 200 yards to it. The breach was then deemed sufficiently\r\npracticable; the gunboats went up the creek as near the walls as\r\npossible, and the two regiments advanced to the assault. The Taepings\r\nfought desperately in the breach itself, and no progress was made. It\r\nis probable that a reverse would have followed had not the howitzers\r\ncontinued to throw shells over the wall, thus inflicting heavy losses\r\non the Taepings, who swarmed in their thousands behind. At that\r\ncritical moment Gordon directed another regiment to escalade the wall\r\nat a point which the Taepings had left unguarded, and the appearance\r\nof these fresh troops on their flank at once decided the day, and\r\ninduced the Taeping leaders to order a retreat. The Taepings lost\r\nheavily, but the loss of the Ever Victorious Army was in proportion\r\nequally great. The latter had twenty men killed and 142 wounded, one\r\nEuropean officer killed and six wounded. But the capture of Taitsan\r\nunder all the circumstances was an exceptionally brilliant and\r\ndecisive affair. With it may be said to have begun the military\r\nreputation of the young commander, whose admirable dispositions had\r\nretrieved a great disaster and inflicted a rude blow on the confidence\r\nof a daring enemy.\r\n\r\nFrom Taitsan he marched to Quinsan; but his force was not yet\r\nthoroughly in hand, and wished to return to Sungkiang, in accordance\r\nwith their practice under Ward of spending their pay and prize-money\r\nafter any successful affair before attempting another. Gordon yielded\r\non this occasion the more easily because he was impressed by the\r\nstrength of Quinsan, and also because his ammunition had run short.\r\nBut his trouble with his men was not yet over, and he had to face a\r\nserious mutiny on the part of his officers. For improved economy and\r\nefficiency Gordon appointed an English commissariat officer, named\r\nCookesley, to control all the stores, and he gave him the rank of\r\nlieutenant-colonel. This gave umbrage to the majors in command of\r\nregiments, who presented a request that they should be allowed the\r\nhigher rank and pay of lieutenant-colonel; and when this was refused\r\nthey sent in their resignations, which were accepted. The affair was\r\nnearly taking a serious turn, as the troops refused to march; but\r\nGordon's firmness overcame the difficulty. Two of the majors were\r\nreinstated, and the others dismissed, but this incident finally\r\ndecided Gordon to change his headquarters from Sungkiang to some place\r\nwhere the bad traditions of Ward and Burgevine were not in force. The\r\nactive operations now undertaken against Quinsan served to distract\r\nthe attention of the men, and to strengthen their commander's\r\ninfluence over them. General Gordon's own description of this affair\r\nis well worth quoting:--\r\n\r\n     \"The force arrived at their old camping ground near the east gate\r\n     of Quinsan on the evening of 27th of May. General Ching had\r\n     established some five or six very strong stockades at this place,\r\n     and, thanks to the steamer _Hyson_, had been able to hold them\r\n     against the repeated attacks of the rebels. The line of rebel\r\n     stockades was not more than 800 yards from his position. The\r\n     force encamped near the stockades; and at daybreak of the 28th\r\n     the 4th and 5th Regiments, with the field artillery, moved to\r\n     attack them. The right stockade was attacked in front, and its\r\n     right flank turned, on seeing which the rebels retreated. They\r\n     were in large force, and had it not been for the numerous bridges\r\n     they had constructed in their rear, they would have suffered\r\n     much, as the pursuit was pressed beyond the north gate close up\r\n     to a stockade they held at the north-east angle of the city.\r\n     Captain Clayton, 99th Regiment, a very gallant officer who had\r\n     gained the goodwill and admiration of every one of the force, was\r\n     unfortunately wounded in the attack, and died some months\r\n     afterwards of his wounds. Our loss was two killed and sixteen\r\n     wounded.\r\n\r\n     \"General Ching was now most anxious to get me to attack the east\r\n     gate on the following day. His object was that he had written to\r\n     the Futai Li, who had in turn passed the statement on to Peking,\r\n     to say that he had his stockades on the edge of the ditch, and\r\n     merely wanted a boat to get into the city. This he showed by a\r\n     plan. The east gate looked, if possible, more unpromising than it\r\n     did before, and I declined to attack it without reconnoitring the\r\n     other side of the city. Accordingly, the next day, 29th May, I\r\n     went in the _Hyson_ with General Ching and Li Hung Chang to\r\n     reconnoitre the west side, and after three hours' steaming came\r\n     within 1000 yards of the main canal, which runs from the west\r\n     gate of Quinsan to Soochow. At the junction of the creek we came\r\n     up with this main canal at the village of Chunye. This place is\r\n     eight miles from Quinsan, and twelve from Soochow. The only road\r\n     between these two places runs along the bank of the creek. The\r\n     rebels had here on its bank two stockades of no great strength,\r\n     and about 500 yards inland, they had, near the village of Chunye,\r\n     a very strong stone fort. About 1000 yards from the stockades the\r\n     creek was staked across. At the time of our arrival large numbers\r\n     of troops were passing towards and from Soochow with horsemen,\r\n     etc. We opened fire on them and on their boats. The rebels seemed\r\n     perfectly amazed at seeing us, and were ready for a run. General\r\n     Ching was as sulky as a bear when he was informed that I thought\r\n     it advisable to take these stockades the next day, and to attack\r\n     on this side of the city.\r\n\r\n     \"At dawn on 30th May the 4th Regiment, 350 strong, with field\r\n     artillery, all in boats and _Hyson_, accompanied by some fifty\r\n     Imperial gunboats, started for Chunye. The Imperial gunboats\r\n     started some hours previous, but had contented themselves with\r\n     halting one and a half miles from the stockades. The whole\r\n     flotilla--some eighty boats, with their large white sails and\r\n     decorated with the usual amount of various-coloured flags, with\r\n     the _Hyson_ in the middle--presented a very picturesque sight,\r\n     and must have made the garrison of Quinsan feel uncomfortable, as\r\n     they could see the smallest move from the high hill inside the\r\n     city, and knew, of course, more than we did of the importance of\r\n     the stockades about to be attacked.\r\n\r\n     \"At noon we came up to the stakes before alluded to, and landed\r\n     the infantry. The Imperial gunboats, now very brave, pulled up\r\n     the stakes, and a general advance with the steamer and troops\r\n     was made. The rebels stood for a minute, and then vacated the\r\n     stockades and ran. The reason of the rebels defending these\r\n     stockades so badly was on account of the ill-feeling between the\r\n     chiefs in charge of Quinsan and Chunye, and the neglect of the\r\n     former to furnish rice to the latter.\r\n\r\n     \"The _Hyson_ [with Gordon on board] now steamed up towards\r\n     Soochow at a slow pace, owing to the innumerable boats that\r\n     crowded the creek, which, vacated by their owners, were drifting\r\n     about with their sails up in every direction. The rebels were in\r\n     clusters along the bank, marching in an orderly way towards\r\n     Soochow. The _Hyson_ opened fire on them and hurried their\r\n     progress, and, hanging on their rear, kept up a steady fire till\r\n     they reached Ta Edin, where a large arch bridge spanned the\r\n     creek, and where the rebels had constructed a splendid stone\r\n     fort. We expected that the rebels would make a stand here, but\r\n     they merely fired one shot, which was answered by a shell from\r\n     the _Hyson_, which went into the embrasure, and the rebels\r\n     continued their flight. It became rather hazardous to pass this\r\n     fort and leave it unoccupied, with the number of armed rebels who\r\n     were between Chunye and Ta Edin. The _Hyson_, moreover, had no\r\n     force on board of any importance. There were with me five or six\r\n     Europeans and some thirty Chinamen--gunners, etc. However, six of\r\n     us landed, and held the fort somehow till more Imperialists came\r\n     up, while the _Hyson_ pushed on towards Soochow.\r\n\r\n     \"The _Hyson_ continued the pursuit, threading her way through the\r\n     boats of all descriptions which crowded the creek, and harassing\r\n     the rear of the rebel columns which extended along the road for\r\n     over a mile. About two miles from Ta Edin another stone fort was\r\n     passed without a shot being fired; this was Siaon Edin.\r\n     Everything was left in the forts by the rebels. Soon after\r\n     passing this place the steamer headed some 400 rebels, and\r\n     Captain Davidson ran her into the bank, and took 150 of them\r\n     prisoners on board the _Hyson_--rather a risk, considering the\r\n     crew of that vessel and her size. Soon after this four horsemen\r\n     were descried riding at full speed about a mile in rear of the\r\n     steamer. They came up, passed the steamer amid a storm of\r\n     bullets, and joined the rebel column. One of them was struck off\r\n     his horse, but the others coolly waited for him, and one of them\r\n     stopped and took him up behind him. They deserved to get off.\r\n     About three miles further on another stockade of stone was passed\r\n     at a broken bridge called Waiquaidong, and the pursuit was\r\n     carried on to about three-quarters of a mile from Soochow. It was\r\n     now getting late (6 P.M.), and we did not know if the rebels in\r\n     our rear might not have occupied the stockades, in which case we\r\n     should have had to find another route back. On our return we met\r\n     crowds of villagers, who burnt at our suggestion the houses in\r\n     the forts at Waiquaidong and Siaon Edin, and took the boats that\r\n     were in the creek.\r\n\r\n     \"We met many boats that had appeared deserted on our passing up\r\n     sailing merrily towards Soochow, but which, when they saw the red\r\n     and green of the steamer and heard her whistle, were immediately\r\n     run into the bank and were deserted. Just before Siaon Edin was\r\n     reached we came on a large body of rebels, who opened a sharp\r\n     fire of rifles on us striking the gun twice. They had got under\r\n     cover of a bridge, which, however, after a short delay, we\r\n     managed to enfilade with a charge of grape and thus cleared them\r\n     out. We then steamed into the bank and took in more prisoners.\r\n     Four chiefs, one a Wang, galloped past on horseback; and although\r\n     not two yards from the steamer, they got away. The Wang got\r\n     shoved into the water and lost his pony. A party of rebels were\r\n     encamped in Siaon Edin, not dreaming of any further annoyance for\r\n     that night, and were accordingly astonished to hear the steamer's\r\n     whistle, and rushed out in amazement, to meet a shell at the\r\n     entrance, which killed two of them. The steamer now pushed on to\r\n     Ta Edin, and found it unoccupied; while waiting there to collect\r\n     some of the prisoners, about 200 rebels came so suddenly on the\r\n     steamer that we were obliged to whistle to keep them off till the\r\n     gun could be got ready.\r\n\r\n     \"It was now 10.30 P.M., and the night was not very clear. At this\r\n     moment the most tremendous firing and cheering was heard from\r\n     Chunye, and hurried our progress to that place. Just before we\r\n     reached it a gunboat disarranged the rudder, and then we were\r\n     dodging about from side to side for some ten minutes, the firing\r\n     and cheering going on as before. At last we got up to the\r\n     junction of the creek, and steaming through the Imperial, and\r\n     other boats, we came on the scene of action. The gunboats were\r\n     drawn up in line, and were firing as fast as they could. The\r\n     stone fort at the village was sparkling with musketry, and at\r\n     times astounding yells burst forth from it. The _Hyson_ blew her\r\n     whistle, and was received with deafening cheers from the\r\n     gunboats, which were on the eve of bolting. She steamed up the\r\n     creek towards Quinsan, and at the distance of 200 yards we saw a\r\n     confused mass near a high bridge. It was too dark to distinguish\r\n     very clearly, but on the steamer blowing the whistle the mass\r\n     wavered, yelled, and turned back. It was the garrison of Quinsan\r\n     attempting to escape to Soochow, some seven or eight thousand\r\n     men.\r\n\r\n     \"Matters were in too critical a state to hesitate, as the mass of\r\n     the rebels, goaded into desperation, would have swept our small\r\n     force away. We were therefore forced to fire into them, and\r\n     pursue them towards Quinsan, firing, however, very rarely, and\r\n     only when the rebels looked as if they would make a stand. The\r\n     steamer went up to about a mile from Quinsan, and then returned.\r\n     Several officers landed and took charge of the prisoners who were\r\n     extended along the bank, and at 4 A.M., 31st May, everything was\r\n     quiet. The _Hyson_ had fired some eighty or ninety rounds during\r\n     the day and night; and although humanity might have desired a\r\n     smaller destruction, it was indispensably necessary to inflict\r\n     such a blow on the garrison of Soochow as would cause them not to\r\n     risk another such engagement, and thus enable us to live in peace\r\n     during the summer--which it indeed did, for the rebels never came\r\n     on this road again. Their loss must have been from three to four\r\n     thousand killed, drowned, and prisoners. We took 800, most of\r\n     whom entered our ranks. They lost all their arms and a very large\r\n     number of boats. At 5 A.M. on 31st May the troops at Chunye and\r\n     the _Hyson_ moved towards Quinsan, and found the remainder of the\r\n     force who had been left at the east gate already in the city. The\r\n     possession of Quinsan was of immense importance in a strategical\r\n     point of view. The circumference of its walls is some five miles,\r\n     but they are very inferior. Its ditch is over forty yards wide,\r\n     and from the nature of the creeks around it would prove very\r\n     difficult to take. The high hill enclosed within its walls would\r\n     enable the slightest move to be seen, and if two or three guns\r\n     were placed on the spurs of this hill it would form a very\r\n     formidable citadel. The rebels did not know its importance till\r\n     they lost it.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the capture of Quinsan, told in the simple words of its\r\ncaptor. It confirmed the reputation gained by the fall of Taitsan, and\r\nproved that the new commander was a man of extraordinary military\r\nintuition as well as energy. There is scarcely room to doubt that if\r\nGordon had attacked Quinsan where the Chinese commander wished him to\r\ndo, at its very strongest point, he would have met with a rude\r\nrepulse. By attacking them on the side of Soochow, and by threatening\r\ntheir communication with that place, he terrified the large garrison\r\nso much that in the end they evacuated the place without resistance.\r\nGordon himself believed that if the mandarins at the head of the\r\nImperial army would have consented to support him in immediate\r\nmeasures for an assault on Soochow, that city would have fallen in the\r\npanic that ensued after the loss of Quinsan. The opportunity being\r\nlost, it will be seen that many months of arduous fighting followed\r\nbefore the same result was achieved.\r\n\r\nThe reasons which rendered a change in the headquarters of the force\r\ndesirable have already been mentioned, and Major Gordon at once\r\ndecided to remove them to Quinsan, a strong and advantageously-placed\r\nposition embarrassing to the Taepings, and equally encouraging to the\r\nImperialists. But if this removal was necessary on grounds of\r\ndiscipline and policy, it was very unpopular with the men themselves,\r\nwho were attached to Sungkiang, where they could easily dispose of\r\ntheir plunder. They determined to make an effort to get the offensive\r\norder withdrawn, and a proclamation was drawn up by the most\r\ndisaffected, who were the non-commissioned officers, and sent to Major\r\nGordon with an intimation that the artillery would blow all the\r\nofficers to pieces unless their demands were complied with. Major\r\nGordon at once sent for all the non-commissioned officers, who paraded\r\nbefore him. When he demanded the name of the writer of the\r\nproclamation they were silent. At this Major Gordon announced that\r\nunless the name was given up, he would shoot one out of every five of\r\nthem. At this statement the men groaned, when Gordon, noticing the man\r\nwho groaned loudest, and shrewdly conceiving him to be a ringleader,\r\nseized him with his own hands, dragged him from the ranks, and ordered\r\ntwo of his bodyguard to shoot the man on the spot. The order was at\r\nonce carried out, and then Gordon, turning to the rest, gave them one\r\nhour to reflect whether they would obey orders, or compel him to shoot\r\none in every five. Within this time they gave way, and discipline was\r\nrestored. Gordon in his official despatch expressed regret for the\r\nman's death, but, as he truly said, \"it saved many others which must\r\nhave been lost if a stop had not been put to the independent way of\r\nthe men.\" But the matter did not quite end here, for more than 2000\r\nmen deserted, but Gordon found no difficulty in filling their places\r\nfrom his prisoners and the villages round Quinsan. It is worthy of\r\nnote that his own bodyguard was mainly composed of Taeping prisoners,\r\nand some of the most faithful of them had been the bearers of the\r\nSnake banners of the rebel Wangs.\r\n\r\nHaving thus settled the differences within his own force, and having\r\nfully established his own authority, Major Gordon would have\r\nprosecuted the attack on Soochow with vigour, if other difficulties\r\nhad not occurred which occupied his time and attention. In the first\r\nplace, there was a serious quarrel with General Ching, who was sore\r\nbecause he had not gained the credit for the capture of Quinsan, and\r\nwho did everything he could to hamper and humiliate the force. At last\r\nhe went to the length of firing on a column of Gordon's force, and as\r\nhe refused all satisfaction, that officer was on the point of marching\r\nto attack him, when Dr--now Sir Halliday--Macartney arrived in his\r\ncamp, being sent in a fully accredited manner, and escorted by the\r\nFutai's bodyguard, as a peace messenger from Li Hung Chang. On this\r\noccasion Sir Halliday Macartney first gave evidence of the exceptional\r\ndiplomatic tact which he has since evinced in so many important\r\nnegotiations, when China derived much advantage from his energy,\r\nability, and devotion to her cause. The storm then blew over, but the\r\nsecond affair was more serious. Li Hung Chang became remiss in his\r\npayment of the force, and on 25th July Gordon sent in his formal\r\nresignation. There is every reason to believe that at this moment\r\nGordon was thoroughly sick of his command, and would willingly have\r\nreturned to Europe. The difficulties with his own men, the want of\r\nco-operation, to say nothing of appreciation on the part of the\r\nChinese authorities, had damped even his zeal in what he reiterated\r\nwas the good cause of restoring peace and security to a suffering\r\npeople; and in addition to these troubles he had to carry on a\r\ncorrespondence with anonymous writers, who made many baseless charges\r\nin the Shanghai and Hongkong papers of cruelty against the men under\r\nhis command. The English General at Shanghai used all his influence,\r\nhowever, with the Chinese Governor to pay up the arrears, and with\r\nGordon to retain the command, because, as he said, there was \"no other\r\nofficer who combined so many dashing qualities, let alone skill and\r\njudgment.\"\r\n\r\nBut the event that really decided Gordon to withdraw his resignation\r\nwas the unexpected return of Burgevine. That adventurer had proceeded\r\nto Peking after his dismissal from the command, and obtained some\r\nsupport from the American minister in pressing his claims on the\r\nChinese. He had been sent back to Shanghai with letters which,\r\nalthough they left some loophole of escape, might be interpreted as\r\nordering Li Hung Chang to reinstate him in the command. This Li,\r\nsupported by the English commanding officer at Shanghai, had\r\nresolutely refused to do, and the feud between the men became more\r\nbitter than ever. Burgevine remained in Shanghai and employed his time\r\nin selling the Taepings arms and ammunition. In this way he\r\nestablished secret relations with their chiefs, and seeing no chance\r\nof Imperial employment he was not unwilling to join his fortunes to\r\ntheirs. This inclination was increased by the belief that he might be\r\nable to form a force of his own which would give a decisive turn to\r\nthe struggle, and his vanity led him to think that he might pose on\r\nthe rebel side as no unequal adversary of Gordon, to whom all the time\r\nhe professed the greatest friendship. These feelings arose from or\r\nwere certainly strengthened by the representations made by several of\r\nthe officers and men whom Gordon had dismissed from his army. They\r\neasily led Burgevine to think that he was not forgotten, and that he\r\nhad only to raise his standard to be joined by many of his old men.\r\n\r\nA fortnight before Gordon's resignation Dr Macartney--who had some\r\ntime before begun his remarkable career in the Chinese service, and of\r\nwhom Gordon himself said: \"He drilled troops, supervised the\r\nmanufacture of shells, gave advice, brightened the Futai's intellect\r\nabout foreigners, and made peace, in which last accomplishment his\r\n_forte_ lay\"--wrote to him, stating that he had positive information\r\nthat Burgevine was enlisting men for some enterprise, that he had\r\nalready enrolled 300, and that he had even chosen a special flag for\r\nhis force. A few days later Burgevine, probably hearing of this\r\ncommunication, wrote to Gordon, begging him not to believe any rumours\r\nabout him, and stating that he was coming up to see him. Gordon\r\nunfortunately believed in this statement, and as he wished to exhibit\r\nspecial lenience towards the man whom he had displaced in the command,\r\nhe went bail for him, so that he retained his personal liberty when\r\nthe Chinese arrested Burgevine's agent Beechy, and wished to arrest\r\nBurgevine himself. On 2nd August Burgevine threw off the mask. At the\r\nhead of a band of thirty-two rowdies, he seized the new steamer\r\n_Kajow_ at Sungkiang, and with that vessel hastened to join the\r\nTaepings. The very day that this happened Gordon reached Shanghai for\r\nthe purpose of resigning his command, but on the receipt of this\r\nintelligence he at once withdrew his resignation and hastened back to\r\nQuinsan. Apart from public considerations, he felt doubly bound to do\r\nthis because Burgevine had not been arrested on his pledged word.\r\n\r\nThe position was undoubtedly critical, for the prospect of plunder\r\noffered by Burgevine was very attractive to mercenaries like the Ever\r\nVictorious Army, and there was a very real risk that the force at\r\nQuinsan, deprived of its commander, might be induced to desert _en\r\nmasse_ under the persuasive promises of Burgevine. When Gordon reached\r\nQuinsan he was so apprehensive as to what might occur that he removed\r\nhis heavy artillery and most of his munitions of war to Taitsan, where\r\nGeneral Brown, in command at Shanghai, undertook to see that they were\r\nprotected. The situation at Quinsan was full of peril, for although\r\nBurgevine had thrown away a chance, by taking a roundabout instead of\r\na direct route to Soochow, of striking a decisive blow before Gordon\r\ncould get back, the Taeping leader, Mow Wang, had not been so\r\nnegligent, and his operations for the recovery of several places taken\r\nby Gordon in the last few days of his command were on the point of\r\nsuccess, when that officer's return arrested the course of his plans.\r\nIt must be pointed out that after this date the Taepings fought with\r\nfar more skill than before. They had a very considerable European\r\ncontingent, probably nearly 300 men, and these served not only as\r\nleaders, but as trainers of the rebel Chinese forces. They had also\r\nobtained some good cannon, and the steamer _Kajow_ proved of material\r\nvalue on water. Gordon found on his return, therefore, that the\r\ndifficulties of the campaign were materially increased. His opponents\r\nwere far stronger and more confident, while his own resources remained\r\nunchanged. Gordon tersely summed up the situation in an official\r\ndespatch: \"There is no knowing what an immense amount of damage might\r\nhave been done if the rebels had had a more energetic man than\r\nBurgevine, and it would be as well not to point out the line which\r\nmight have been taken.\"\r\n\r\nThe first engagements of this more difficult and keenly-contested\r\nphase of the campaign took place at Kahpoo, a place on the canal some\r\nmiles south of Soochow. Gordon had taken it a week before he left for\r\nShanghai, as a sort of parting gift to the Chinese, but when he\r\narrived there on 9th August he found the garrison hard pressed,\r\nalthough the _Hyson_ was stationed there--and indeed nothing but his\r\narrival with a third steamer, the _Cricket_, averted its recapture.\r\nAfter five days' operations, that do not require description, the\r\nneighbourhood of Kahpoo was cleared of rebels, and Gordon returned to\r\nQuinsan, where the most essential task had to be accomplished of\r\nrestoring the discipline of his own force. As some assistance in this\r\ndifficult task General Brown lent him the services of 200 Beluches,\r\nwhose admirable conduct and splendid appearance went far to restore a\r\nhealthy spirit among his own men. At the same time these troops\r\nensured the safety of Quinsan and also of Gordon himself, at least\r\nagainst the treachery of Burgevine's sympathisers.\r\n\r\nThe season of the year, the hottest and most trying of the long\r\nChinese summer, compelled inaction, and Gordon felt doubly the need of\r\ncaution now that he was brought face to face with the most arduous\r\nundertaking of the whole war, viz. the siege and capture of Soochow.\r\nGeneral Ching's headquarters were at Ta Edin, and he had also occupied\r\nin force Waiquaidong, only two miles from the eastern gate of Soochow.\r\nBefore the end of September he had pushed on still further, and\r\nerected his stockades within half a mile of that position. At this\r\nmoment Gordon, anxious as to what might happen to his too-adventurous\r\ncolleague, advanced with his force to his aid, and took up the supreme\r\ndirection of the attack on Soochow. As usual, Gordon began by making a\r\ncareful examination of the extensive rebel positions at and round\r\nSoochow, and the result of it was that he decided to capture the\r\nstockades and village of Patachiaou, one mile distant from the south\r\nwall of that city. His plan met with easy success, for the Taepings\r\nwere not expecting an attack in that quarter, and offered little\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nEasily as they had been driven out of it, the Taepings made a very\r\ndetermined effort to retake it a few days later, and it was only by\r\ndesperate exertions that Gordon succeeded in holding what he had won.\r\nThis was the first occasion on which Burgevine and the _Kajow_\r\nsteamer, commanded by Captain Jones, \"a daring and capable officer,\"\r\nto use Gordon's words, came into action. The rebels were extremely\r\nconfident for this reason, and also because they had some heavy\r\nartillery. Gordon had to keep to his stockades, and to send the\r\n_Hyson_ out of action from fear of its being damaged by the enemy's\r\nshell, but the Taepings were afraid to come to close quarters, and\r\neventually retreated before a well-timed _sortie_. In this engagement\r\nGordon had the co-operation of a French-trained Chinese regiment,\r\nunder the command of a gallant officer, Captain Bonnefoy. After this\r\nthere was a lull, but Gordon felt too weak to attempt anything serious\r\nagainst Soochow, and he deprecated all operations until he could\r\nstrike an effective blow. In this respect he differed materially from\r\nhis Chinese colleague, General Ching, who was most restless and\r\nenterprising, but his ill-directed energy produced no result, and even\r\nassisted the enemy's plans.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the Taeping hero Chung Wang arrived from Nanking with\r\nreinforcements, and imparted a new vigour to the defence. But whether\r\non account of jealousy, or of disappointment at the poor services he\r\nhad rendered, it also resulted in the dismissal of Burgevine, an\r\nincident of which some brief account may be given before following the\r\nmain course of the campaign. More than one ground of dispute led up to\r\nthis conclusion. In the first place, Burgevine was disappointed at\r\nfinding several of the rebel Wangs as clever and ambitious as he was,\r\nand they were disappointed at the amount of service and help he could\r\ngive them. This feeling culminated in angry scenes, when, on being\r\nsent into Shanghai in disguise to purchase arms with a large sum of\r\nmoney, he returned to Soochow without either money or weapons. He was\r\napparently given, as a last chance, the opportunity of regaining his\r\nreputation by entrapping Gordon into the rebel power, and he\r\nthoroughly entered into the scheme, although he failed to carry it\r\nout. On 3rd October--that is to say, two days after the failure to\r\nretake Patachiaou--Burgevine made the first step in this plot by\r\naddressing a letter to Gordon, thanking him for the offer of medicines\r\nhe had sent, and offering to meet him whenever he liked to discuss\r\nmatters. On the 6th he met Gordon at the stockades, and declared his\r\nwillingness to abandon the Taepings and come over with all his force,\r\nincluding the _Kajow_. He and his companions were guaranteed their\r\nlives, and the arrangement seemed complete. Two days later he had a\r\nsecond interview with the English officer, when he made the\r\nextraordinary proposition that he and Gordon should join bands,\r\nattack both Taepings and Imperialists, and fight for their own hand.\r\nThis mad and unprincipled proposal excited Gordon's anger, but it was\r\nonly Burgevine's old filibustering idea revived under unfavourable\r\nconditions. It was while smarting under this rebuff that Burgevine\r\nproposed to Captain Jones a fresh plot for entrapping Gordon, while\r\nhe, unsuspecting evil, was engaged in conferences for their surrender;\r\nbut to Jones's credit, let it be stated that he refused to have any\r\npart in such black treachery. Thereupon Burgevine attempted to take\r\nJones's life, either to conceal his own treachery or to enable him to\r\ncarry out his interrupted plans. Much delay occurred in carrying out\r\nthe project of Burgevine's desertion, and Gordon, rendered specially\r\nanxious to save his and the other foreigners' lives, because one party\r\nhad escaped without Burgevine, wrote a strong letter on the subject to\r\nMow Wang, Chung Wang's chief lieutenant. He also sent him a present of\r\na pony, at which the rebel chief was so much pleased that he agreed to\r\nrelease Burgevine, and on 18th October that person appeared at the\r\noutworks of Gordon's position. His personal safety was entirely due to\r\nGordon's humane efforts, and to the impression that officer had made\r\non the Taepings as a chivalrous opponent. The American Consul at\r\nShanghai, Mr Seward, officially thanked Major Gordon for his \"great\r\nkindness to misguided General Burgevine and his men.\" Nearly two years\r\nlater this adventurer met the fate he so narrowly escaped on several\r\noccasions. He had been forbidden by his own Consul as well as the\r\nChinese Government ever to return to China, but in June 1865 he broke\r\nhis parole. Before he could be arrested he met with his death by\r\naccident, being drowned when crossing a Chinese river, but rumours\r\nwere prevalent that his death was an act of vengeance instigated by\r\nhis old enemy the Futai, Li Hung Chang.\r\n\r\nThe assumption of the supreme command by Chung Wang was soon followed\r\nby those offensive operations which had made that dashing leader the\r\nmost famous of all the rebel generals. Gordon and the bulk of his\r\ncorps were at Patachiaou, south of Soochow--only General Ching and the\r\nChinese army were north of that place--and he resolved to attack them\r\nand force his way through to Chanzu, which he wished to recover as\r\nopening a road to the river and the outer world. Gordon divined his\r\nintention, and for some time prevented him carrying it out by making\r\nthreatening demonstrations with his gunboats on the western side of\r\nSoochow; but his own attention was soon diverted to another part of\r\nthe country where a new and unexpected danger threatened his own\r\nposition and communications. A large rebel force, computed to number\r\n20,000 men, had suddenly appeared behind Major Gordon's position and\r\nattacked the Imperial garrison stationed at Wokong, a place on the\r\ncanal twelve or thirteen miles south of Soochow. The news that reached\r\nGordon on 12th October from this quarter was that the garrison, having\r\nbeen repulsed in a _sortie_ with a loss of several hundred men, could\r\nnot hold out many hours. Gordon at once hastened to the rescue at the\r\nhead of one of his regiments, and with the invaluable _Hyson_ steamer.\r\nHe found his allies quite cowed, afraid even to open the gates of\r\ntheir stockades to admit him and his men, and the enemy drawn up in\r\nimposing lines at a distance of about 1500 yards. He at once ordered\r\nthe attack, and during three hours the engagement was contested in the\r\nmost obstinate and spirited manner. The rebels, having their line of\r\nretreat secure, fought bravely. Gordon had to bring up his heavy guns\r\nto within forty yards of the wall before they would gave way, and even\r\nthen they stood at the second and third inner stockades. Gordon never\r\ngave them a chance of recovering, but having got them on the run, kept\r\nthem at it for a distance of ten miles. This was one of Gordon's\r\ngreatest victories in the open field. The Taepings never fought\r\nbetter, yet with 1000 good Chinese troops Gordon routed more than\r\n20,000 of them.\r\n\r\nChung Wang had begun his march towards Chanzu, but after some slight\r\nsuccesses met with a rude repulse at Monding, where he also lost the\r\nsteamer _Kajow_, which was sunk by an accidental explosion. He then\r\nestablished his headquarters at Wusieh, a place on the Grand Canal,\r\nabout twenty-five miles north of Soochow. Here he hoped to effect some\r\ndiversion that might relieve the increasing pressure on Soochow\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime that pressure had greatly increased, owing to the\r\nbolder measures to which Gordon resorted after the European contingent\r\nabandoned the Taeping side. His first step was to attack and capture\r\nthe stockades at Wuliungchow, a village two miles west of Patachiaou,\r\nwhich commanded a passage leading from the Taiho Lake to the south\r\ngate of Soochow. Gordon managed to conceal the real object of his\r\nattack from the Taepings, and to capture the stockades with little\r\nloss. The wet weather and the unexpected nature of the attack\r\nexplained this easy success, for the stockades were strong and well\r\nplaced. Chung Wang returned from Wusieh with the special object of\r\nretaking them, but he was repulsed with some loss, and then hurried\r\nback to that place. A few days later part of Gordon's force, under\r\nMajor Kirkham, was sent to Wokong, which was again being threatened by\r\nthe Taepings, and obtained a brilliant success, capturing 1300\r\nprisoners and not fewer than 1600 boats, including sixteen gunboats.\r\n\r\nHaving achieved this success on the south, Gordon proceeded with his\r\nplans to secure an equally advantageous position on the north side. He\r\nleft two regiments at Wuliungchow, which he greatly strengthened, and\r\nwith the remainder he went to Waiquaidong, where he proposed to\r\ndeliver his attack on the Leeku stockades, only a short distance in\r\nfront of the north gate of Soochow. This operation was carried out\r\nwith complete success, and it was promptly followed up by the capture\r\nof the rebel positions at Wanti, which enabled the forces round\r\nSoochow to join hands with the other considerable Imperial army that\r\nhad been placed in the field by the energy of Li Hung Chang, and\r\nentrusted to the command of his brother, San Tajin. This last force\r\nwas opposed to Chung Wang, but although numerically the stronger, the\r\nwant of the most rudimentary military knowledge in its commander\r\nreduced this army of 20,000 men to inglorious inaction. At this stage\r\nof the struggle it will be well to sum up in Gordon's own words the\r\ndifferent positions held by the contending forces:--\r\n\r\n     \"We held the Taiho Lake with the steamers the _Hyson_, the\r\n     _Tsatlee_, _Firefly_, and 200 men (Imperialists), which cruised\r\n     off Moodow, and prevented supplies coming to Soochow up the creek\r\n     which leads from that village to the small West Gate, or\r\n     Shih-mun, of Soochow, and where they had many actions with the\r\n     rebel gunboats. The next great water outlet was closed to the\r\n     rebels by our possession with 1000 men (Imperialists) of\r\n     Wuliungchow. Off the Pon-mun, or South Gate, the next main water\r\n     and road communication to the south was closed to them by our\r\n     occupation by 1500 men (Imperialists) of the Patachiaou stockades\r\n     on the Grand Canal, south of the south-east angle of Soochow. The\r\n     next, which led from the east gate of Soochow to Quinsan, was\r\n     closed by Ching's force of 3000 or 4000 men, nearly two miles\r\n     from the gate. These men were well posted in strong and\r\n     well-constructed stockades. The next position held was Leeku,\r\n     where I had one regiment, and at Wanti there was another\r\n     regiment. The total force in the stockades was about 8500 men,\r\n     leaving for field operation 2500 Imperialists, 2100 of the\r\n     Quinsan Corps, and 400 Franco-Chinese. San Tajin had 20,000 to\r\n     30,000, in three separate camps. He was utterly incapable for\r\n     command of any sort.\r\n\r\n     \"The rebels held Soochow with some 40,000 men in and around the\r\n     city. The city of Wusieh held some 20,000 men, and Chung Wang had\r\n     at Mahtanchow some 18,000 more. Chung Wang's position was central\r\n     between Wusieh and Soochow, some ten miles in advance of the\r\n     Grand Canal, so as to be able to give help to either city, and to\r\n     attack on the flank any advance made by us on their grand line of\r\n     communications by that canal.\"\r\n\r\nThe city of Soochow, now so closely beleaguered, was of imposing\r\nappearance. An English traveller who saw it at this time thus\r\ndescribes it:--\r\n\r\n     \"Further than the eye could penetrate in the misty morning\r\n     stretched the grizzled walls of Soochow, a city celebrated for\r\n     ages in the history of China for its size, population, wealth,\r\n     and luxury, but now stripped of its magnificence, and held by an\r\n     army of Taeping banditti against the Imperial forces. To the\r\n     right and left, mile after mile, rose the line of lofty wall and\r\n     grey turret, while above all appeared not only the graceful\r\n     pagodas, which have been for ages the boast of Soochow and the\r\n     dense foliage of secular trees--the invariable glory of Chinese\r\n     cities--but also the shimmering roofs of newly decorated palaces\r\n     confidently occupied by the vainglorious leaders of the\r\n     rebellion. The proximity of the rebel line became apparent with\r\n     surprising suddenness, for, following their usual custom, they\r\n     greeted the rising sun with a simultaneous display of gaudy\r\n     banners above the line of their entrenchments. The mud walls they\r\n     had thrown up in advance, scarcely distinguishable before, were\r\n     now marked out by thousands of flags of every colour from black\r\n     to crimson, whilst behind them rose the jangling roll of gongs,\r\n     and the murmurs of an invisible multitude.\"\r\n\r\nHad Gordon been free to act, or even if he had possessed authority\r\nover the two Chinese commanders, his plan of campaign would have been\r\nsimple and decisive. He would have effected a junction of his forces\r\nwith San Tajin; and having overwhelmed Chung Wang and his 18,000 men\r\nwith his combined army of double that strength, he would have appeared\r\nat the head of his victorious troops before the bewildered garrison of\r\nWusieh. He would probably have thus terminated the campaign at a\r\nstroke. Even the decisive defeat of Chung Wang alone might have\r\nentailed the collapse of the cause now tottering to its fall. But\r\nMajor Gordon had to consider not merely the military quality of his\r\nallies, but also their jealousies and differences. General Ching hated\r\nSan Tajin on private as well as on public grounds. He desired a\r\nmonopoly of the profit and honour of the campaign. His own reputation\r\nwould be made by the capture of Soochow. It would be diminished and\r\ncast into the shade were another Imperial commander to defeat Chung\r\nWang and close the line of the Grand Canal. If Gordon detached himself\r\nfrom General Ching, he could not feel sure what folly that jealous and\r\nimpulsive commander might not commit. He would certainly not pursue\r\nthe vigilant defence before Soochow necessary to guard the extensive\r\nline of stockades, and to prevent its large garrison sallying out and\r\nassailing his own rear. Gordon had consequently for these\r\nconsiderations to abandon the tempting idea of crushing Chung Wang and\r\ncapturing the towns in the rear of Nanking, and to have recourse to\r\nsafer if slower methods.\r\n\r\nBut if he had to abandon the larger plan, he still stuck tenaciously\r\nto his main idea that the way to capture Soochow was to isolate it,\r\nand above all to sever Chung Wang's communication with it. Several\r\nweeks passed before Gordon could complete the necessary arrangements,\r\nbut at last, on 19th November, he left Leeku at the head of the\r\ngreater part of his own force and a large contingent of Ching's braves\r\nto attack the stockades at Fusaiquan on the Grand Canal, about four\r\nmiles north of Leeku. The Taeping position was a strong one, including\r\neight separate earthworks, a stone fort, and several stockades. Gordon\r\nsaid \"it was far the best built and strongest position he had yet\r\nseen,\" but the rebels evacuated it in the most cowardly manner without\r\nattempting the least resistance. Gordon goes on to say: \"Our loss was\r\nnone killed, and none wounded! We had expected a most desperate\r\ndefence. If ever men deserved beheading, the Taeping leaders did on\r\nthis occasion.\" The immediate consequence of this success was that\r\nChung Wang quitted his camp in face of San Tajin, and, joining the\r\nWusieh corps, concentrated his whole force for the defence of the\r\nGrand Canal.\r\n\r\nHaving thus strengthened his position towards the north, Gordon, very\r\nmuch to Ching's satisfaction, fell in with his views to begin a direct\r\nattack on Soochow itself. For good reasons it was decided that the\r\nnorth-east angle of Soochow was the weakest, but before it could be\r\nattacked it was necessary to capture the strong stockades which the\r\nrebels had erected in front of the East and North Gates. The East\r\nGate, or Low Mun, stockades were selected for the first attack, and as\r\nthe scene of a reverse to Ching's force on 14th October, the Chinese\r\ncommander was specially anxious to capture them. They were exceedingly\r\nformidable, consisting of a line of breastwork, defended at intervals\r\nwith circular stockades, and the position was well chosen and strongly\r\nfortified. After reconnoitring it, and obtaining all the information\r\nhe could from deserters, Gordon determined on a night attack; but\r\nunfortunately not only were his plans revealed to the Taepings by\r\ntraitors in his own camp, but his arrangements miscarried. As is often\r\nthe case with night attacks, the plan of attack was not adhered to,\r\nand much confusion followed. The breastwork was carried by a small\r\npart of his troops, but the stockades in its rear were never reached.\r\nEncouraged by Gordon's example, who seemed to be at every point at the\r\nsame moment, his men held on to the breastwork, but the supports would\r\nnot move up, and when he hastened to the rear to encourage them, the\r\nTaepings under Mow Wang attacked in their turn and manned the\r\nbreastwork. There was nothing now to be done but to draw off the\r\ntroops, which was executed with comparatively slight loss; but 165\r\nofficers and men were killed or wounded--the majority being killed or\r\nmissing. This loss would have been much greater if the Taepings had\r\nonly had the courage to leave their position, but fortunately they\r\nshowed themselves unable to follow up their success. This was Gordon's\r\nfirst defeat, but it was so obviously due to special causes that it\r\ndid not much dishearten his men, or diminish the high reputation he\r\nand his force had gained by thirteen previous victories.\r\n\r\nBut the necessity to retrieve such a reverse was obvious, and Gordon\r\ncollected the whole of his corps for the purpose of capturing the Low\r\nMun stockades. He also placed his siege guns in position, and began a\r\nheavy bombardment in the morning of 29th November as the preliminary\r\nto attack. On his side, Mow Wang made all his preparations for\r\ndefence, which had been rendered the more necessary because there were\r\ndissensions among the Taeping leaders themselves, one of whom, named\r\nLar Wang, had offered to surrender with his followers to General Ching\r\non terms. Partly on this account Chung Wang rode into Soochow with a\r\nbodyguard of a few hundred men by the only bridle-path available, and\r\nhis presence composed for the moment the quarrels of the Taeping\r\nleaders. But the result depended on the successful defence of the\r\nstockades in front of the East Gate, and Gordon was equally intent on\r\ncapturing them. After a short bombardment the breastwork seemed so\r\nknocked about that Gordon ordered a column to advance to the assault,\r\nbut it was met by a tremendous fire and compelled to turn back. Then\r\nthe bombardment was renewed, and the field-pieces were pushed forward\r\nas far as possible. A second assault was then delivered, but the\r\ncreek--fourteen yards across--was too wide for the bridge, and things\r\nagain looked black, when the officers boldly jumped into the water,\r\nand their men following, the whole position was captured at a rush.\r\nOnce this success was gained, the defence of the Taepings, who had\r\nfought well, collapsed, and stockade after stockade was carried with\r\nlittle or no loss. Gordon himself, with a mere handful of men,\r\ncaptured three more stockades and a stone fort that he said could have\r\nheld out after all the other positions had fallen. The loss of the\r\ncorps in this severe but decisive engagement was heavy, amounting to 6\r\nofficers killed, and 3 wounded; 50 men killed, and 128 wounded,\r\nbesides 5 Europeans of the Bodyguard. But this assault was decisive,\r\ninasmuch as it was the last that had to be made on the defences of\r\nSoochow before the fall of that place.\r\n\r\nAt this point it will be appropriate to say something about Gordon's\r\nrelations with his own officers, many of whom contemplated, whenever\r\ndissatisfied with their treatment or at prolonged inaction, selling\r\ntheir cause and services to the Taepings. During the siege he\r\ndiscovered that Captain Perry had written a letter giving the enemy\r\ninformation, but Gordon agreed to look over the offence on the\r\ncondition that Perry led the next forlorn hope, which happened to be\r\nthe affair at the Leeku stockades. Gordon had forgotten the condition,\r\nbut Perry remembered it, and led the assault. He was shot in the\r\nmouth, and fell into the arms of his commander, ever at the point of\r\ndanger. Perry was the first man killed, and Gordon's epitaph was that\r\nhe was \"a very good officer.\" Although Gordon was a strict and even\r\nsevere disciplinarian, he was always solicitous of the interests of\r\nthe officers who worked under him, and he set apart the greater\r\nportion of his pay in the Chinese service, which had been fixed at\r\nL1,200 a year, for their benefit, more especially for the purchase of\r\nmedicine and comforts for the ill or wounded. There was no\r\nexaggeration at all in the statement that he left China without any\r\nsavings and as poor as when he reached it.\r\n\r\nFrom the gallant deeds of Gordon and his corps the course of the siege\r\npasses to the intrigues and negotiations between General Ching and Lar\r\nWang. These had made so much progress that Lar Wang's troops abandoned\r\nthe formidable stockades in front of the North Gate, which were\r\noccupied without the least attempt at resistance. Several interviews\r\ntook place with the Taeping leaders, and Gordon was present at some of\r\nthese, but Li Hung Chang asserts that he was not present at the most\r\nimportant of them; and that he was not a signatory of the convention\r\nof surrender. He was strongly in favour of good terms being granted to\r\nthe rebels, and impressed his views on both Li Hung Chang, who had\r\ncome up to the camp to be present at the fall of Soochow, and General\r\nChing. From both he received the most positive assurances that the\r\nlives of all the Wangs would be spared, and such was no doubt their\r\nintention, but events were too strong for them. The most interesting\r\nof these leaders, with, of course, the exception of Chung Wang, was\r\nMow Wang, who would have nothing to say to a surrender, and wished to\r\nfight to the death. He was the man who had sent back Burgevine, and\r\nGordon admired his courage so much that he resolved to spare no effort\r\nto save his life. He asked Li to assign Mow Wang to him, and this\r\nrequest was granted. Unfortunately all these efforts were thrown away,\r\nfor on the 4th December, during a banquet given at Mow Wang's palace,\r\nthe other Wangs had fallen upon and murdered that chief, who would\r\nhave resisted with all his force their projected surrender of the\r\nplace. The next day Lar Wang, who had taken an oath of brotherhood\r\nwith General Ching, gave up one of the gates, and his numerous\r\nfollowers undertook to shave their heads in token of surrender. The\r\nImperialist troops occupied the gate, and prepared to take possession\r\nof the city, but Gordon would not allow any of his men to leave the\r\nstockades as he foresaw the impossibility of preventing them from\r\nplundering if they were permitted to advance into the city. But he\r\nwent and represented the case to Li Hung Chang, and demanded two\r\nmonths' pay for his men as a reward for their good service, and as\r\nsome compensation for the loss of loot. Li replied that he could not\r\ngrant the request, and Gordon at once resigned for the second time\r\nduring his connection with the Chinese Government. There was serious\r\nrisk of an outbreak on the part of the discontented soldiers of the\r\nEver Victorious Army, but on General Ching providing one month's pay\r\nGordon used his influence with his men to march quietly back to\r\nQuinsan. The men at first received this order with shouts of\r\ndissatisfaction, and even threatened to attack the Futai Li, but\r\nGordon succeeded in overcoming their objections, and the worst that\r\nhappened was a noisy demonstration as the troops passed Li Hung\r\nChang's tent, where Gordon and another officer stood on guard.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese officials were delighted to thus get rid of the Ever\r\nVictorious Army, without which they would never have seen the inside\r\nof Soochow. Its presence diminished their credit and interfered with\r\nthe execution of the plans which they had no doubt held throughout all\r\nthe negotiations with Lar Wang. Neither Li nor Ching wished Lar Wang\r\nand his colleagues to be saved, and thus allowed to become rivals to\r\nthemselves in the race of official honour and wealth. There was\r\nnothing surprising in this, and the only matter for astonishment is\r\nthat Lar Wang, well acquainted with the Punic faith of his countrymen,\r\nand with such a black record from the Government point of view, should\r\nhave so easily placed faith in the word of his enemies. This was the\r\nmore extraordinary because Gordon himself went into the city and saw\r\nLar Wang at his own house before he left for Li Hung Chang's quarters,\r\nwhere a banquet had been arranged, and asked him very pressingly\r\nwhether he was quite satisfied. Gordon himself seems to have had\r\nsuspicions or apprehensions, for he even offered to take him on board\r\nhis own steamer with which he was going to cruise in the Taiho Lake.\r\nLar Wang, however, was quite confident, and said that all was well.\r\nThis confidence was doubly unfortunate, for Gordon had excused himself\r\nfrom the Futai's banquet on the ground that his presence might seem\r\nhumiliating to the Taeping leaders, whereas it was the only thing that\r\ncould have averted their fate. As Gordon was leaving the city the\r\nWangs passed him, laughing and talking, and riding apparently unarmed\r\nto the Futai's quarters. The next time Gordon saw them was when he\r\nbeheld their headless bodies lying on the river bank near their host's\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nGordon after this walked through the city, as some hours would elapse\r\nbefore the steamer could get round to the south-west side, where he\r\nintended to embark. While on his way he was joined by Dr Macartney.\r\nThey both proceeded to the walls near the Eastern Gate, and on looking\r\ntowards the Futai's quarters Gordon noticed a large crowd, but he did\r\nnot attach any significance to it. About half an hour later a large\r\nnumber of Imperial soldiers entered the city, and set up a yell, as\r\nwas their custom, and fired off guns. Gordon represented to their\r\nofficers that this conduct was against the agreement, and might lead\r\nto disturbance, as the city was still crowded with Taepings. At this\r\njuncture General Ching appeared. As Gordon was supposed to be on his\r\nsteamer on his way to the lake, he seemed taken aback, and turned\r\npale. To Gordon's repeated inquiries as to whether all was well, he\r\nmade a rambling statement that Lar Wang had made unreasonable demands,\r\nthat he had refused to carry out the exact terms of the surrender, and\r\nfinally, that he had run away. Gordon then asked Dr Macartney, as he\r\nknew Chinese, to go to Lar Wang's house, and reassure him if he found\r\nhim there, but this statement must be taken in conjunction with the\r\nimportant narrative I give two pages further on. Gordon went a little\r\nway with General Ching, and then decided to wait at the North Gate for\r\nfurther intelligence, while the Chinese commander continued his round.\r\nGordon then began to question his own interpreter as to what he\r\nthought, and on receiving the reply that \"there was something\r\nimproper,\" he determined to proceed himself with all speed to Lar\r\nWang's house. On his way he passed through crowds of excited Taeping\r\nsoldiers, and he also met a band of Imperialists laden with plunder.\r\nLar Wang's palace had been pillaged and gutted, but an uncle of his,\r\nnamed Wangchi, was there, and he begged Gordon to help him to escort\r\nthe females of Lar Wang's family to his own house. Gordon agreed to do\r\nthis, but when he reached Wangchi's house, he found five or six\r\nhundred armed men in the courtyard. The doors were closed, and Wangchi\r\nrefused to allow either Gordon or his interpreter to leave. During the\r\nnight large bodies of excited Taepings, who knew that their chiefs had\r\nbeen entrapped, although, fortunately, not aware of their murder,\r\nrallied on this spot, and Gordon was thus placed in a position of the\r\ngreatest personal peril.\r\n\r\nAt length leave was given him to send his interpreter, escorted by two\r\nTaepings, to summon his own bodyguard, and to take an order to\r\nanother part of his force to seize the Futai and hold him as a hostage\r\nfor the safety of the Wangs. The interpreter was attacked on the way\r\nby Imperialists, who wounded him, and tore up Gordon's letters. When\r\none of the Taeping guides brought back this news Gordon was allowed to\r\nleave himself for the same purpose; but he was arrested on the way by\r\nsome Imperialists, detained for several hours, and the morning was far\r\nadvanced before he was able to send back his bodyguard for the\r\nprotection of Wangchi's house and family. He then moved a further\r\nforce into the city, to prevent the massacre that the Imperialists\r\nseemed to be contemplating, and in this task he was gallantly seconded\r\nby Captain Bonnefoy and the Franco-Chinese contingent. Having taken\r\nthese steps, Gordon waited near the Eastern Gate for all his steamers,\r\nwith which he intended to seize the Futai, and make him give up the\r\nWangs. At this moment General Ching approached him, but before he\r\ncould begin his excuses, \"he met with such a storm that he made a\r\nprecipitate retreat into the city.\" Ching then sent an English\r\nofficer, one of Gordon's own force, to explain matters, but he did not\r\nknow whether the chiefs were alive or dead. He went on to say,\r\nhowever, that Lar Wang's son was in his tent, and on the boy being\r\nsent for, he said that his father had been executed on the opposite\r\nside of the creek. The steamers had still not arrived, and Gordon\r\nasked one of his lieutenants, Prince F. von Wittgenstein, to cross the\r\ncreek in his boat and report what he saw. He returned with the\r\nintelligence that there were nine headless bodies. Gordon then crossed\r\nhimself, and identified Lar Wang and several of his companions. There\r\nwas consequently no further doubt as to what had happened, or anything\r\nleft for Gordon to do than to secure them decent burial. Having done\r\nthis he abandoned his trip to the Taiho Lake, and hastened to Quinsan.\r\n\r\nThe exact mode of this assassination seems to have been as follows:\r\nWhen the Wangs came out of the city they were met by General Ching,\r\nwho did not, however, accompany them to the Futai Li Hung Chang. That\r\nofficial received them in a stockade near his boat, some conversation\r\nensued, and then Li left the stockade. Here again reference should be\r\nmade to the authoritative narrative that follows. A party of Imperial\r\ntroops closed the gates, seized the Wangs, and at once beheaded them.\r\nLi Hung Chang very soon afterwards left his quarters for a different\r\nand remote part of the Imperial camp.\r\n\r\nThis treacherous act, although quite in accordance with Chinese\r\ntraditions, was generally denounced at the time, and has excited much\r\ndiscussion since. Major Gordon certainly felt it very keenly, for he\r\nconsidered that his word had been pledged as much as the Chinese\r\ncommander's for the safety of the leaders who surrendered. It has been\r\nshown how energetically he acted once he suspected that anything was\r\nwrong, but it seems as if it were going too far to say that he thought\r\nfor a moment of exacting a summary revenge on the person of Li Hung\r\nChang. Sir Henry Gordon, writing with at least a sense of\r\nresponsibility, says on this point: \"It is not the fact that Major\r\nGordon sought the Futai with the intention of shooting him. It is a\r\ncomplete misrepresentation to say he did so. It is true he endeavoured\r\nunsuccessfully to have an explanation with him, but not of the nature\r\nasserted.\" But it must also be reaffirmed that as long as Gordon\r\nthought he could save the Wangs' lives he was prepared to secure the\r\nperson of Li Hung Chang and hold him as a hostage for their safety. Of\r\nthat, at least, there can be no question.\r\n\r\nI must now ask the reader to return to the point when Gordon and Dr\r\nMacartney were standing on the wall near the Low Mun Gate, in order\r\nthat the following important and authoritative narrative may be\r\nunderstood. General Ching entered by this gate at the head of a party\r\nof his troops, and Gordon, somewhat uneasy at the signs of commotion\r\nhe thought he had detected across the creek, at once addressed him,\r\nasking--\"Well, how did it go off? Have the Wangs seen the Futai?\"\r\n\r\nTaken off his guard, or confused between the sudden question and his\r\nown knowledge of what had occurred, Ching quickly replied, \"They have\r\nnot seen the Futai.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" replied Gordon, equally hastily; \"that must be nonsense. I saw\r\nthe Wangs myself ride out of the city to the rendezvous, and spoke to\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nChing then corrected himself by saying, \"Oh, yes, that is all right,\r\nbut they have not shaved their heads, and they want to retain half the\r\ncity,\" the western half, that nearest to the relieving force, still at\r\na considerable distance from Soochow, under the heroic Chung Wang.\r\n\r\nTo which Gordon at once responded, \"That won't do. They must conform\r\nwith what has been agreed upon,\" and turning to Macartney, he said,\r\n\"Will you go to the Lar Wang's palace and tell him that this cannot\r\nbe, and meet me afterwards at Wuliungchow, where I am to join the\r\nsteamer _Hyson_ to go on the Taiho Lake?\"\r\n\r\nMacartney at once accepted the mission, and proceeded to the Lar\r\nWang's palace, but before following him thither it is necessary to\r\nrefer to two earlier passages, one known and the other up to this\r\nmoment unknown, in the relations of General Gordon and Sir Halliday\r\nMacartney.\r\n\r\nThe passage which is known is that where Macartney, sent as the\r\nrepresentative of the Futai Li Hung Chang, and escorted by that\r\nGovernor's own bodyguard, healed the breach caused between Gordon and\r\nGeneral Ching by the latter firing on some of Gordon's troops and\r\ntreating the matter with marked levity, which so enraged Gordon that\r\nhe was on the point of attacking the Imperialist troops when Sir\r\nHalliday Macartney arrived as peacemaker, and with equal tact and\r\nenergy averted the catastrophe. This incident has already been\r\nreferred to, and need not further detain us. I come now to the second\r\nand more interesting matter.\r\n\r\nSome weeks before the fall of Soochow, but at a moment when it had\r\nbecome clear that the place could not hold out much longer, Gordon\r\napproached Macartney and said: \"I want to speak to you very privately,\r\nand as I do not wish any one to hear our conversation, will you come\r\non board my boat?\" When they were both on board, Gordon ordered his\r\nChinese sailors to pull out to the centre of the lake before he would\r\nsay a word. Having thus rendered secrecy assured, Gordon spoke as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n     \"Macartney, I have brought you out here so that nobody should\r\n     know of our conversation, and that we might speak out as man to\r\n     man. I must tell you, in the first place, that as soon as Soochow\r\n     falls I intend to resign the command and return home. With that\r\n     intention in my mind, I have been anxiously considering who was\r\n     the best man to name as my successor in the command of the Ever\r\n     Victorious Army, and, after the most careful consideration, I\r\n     have come to the conclusion that you are the best man. Will you\r\n     take the command?\"\r\n\r\nThis unexpected question was the more embarrassing to Macartney,\r\nbecause, long before Gordon was appointed, rumour had freely credited\r\nhim with coveting the command of the Ever Victorious Army in\r\nsuccession to Burgevine, and, as a matter of fact, the Chinese\r\nauthorities had wished him to have the command. However, nothing had\r\ncome of the project, and Macartney, after his post as Burgevine's\r\nmilitary secretary had ceased to exist with the dismissal and treason\r\nof that adventurer, was appointed to a separate command of a portion\r\nof the Imperialist forces. The course of events had now, in an\r\nunexpected but highly complimentary manner, brought the realisation of\r\nany hopes he may have entertained on the subject within his reach. He\r\nreplied to Gordon as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"As you speak so frankly to me, I will speak equally frankly to\r\n     you, and tell you something I have never told a living person.\r\n     Rumour has credited me with having aspired to the command of this\r\n     force, but erroneously so. My ambition was to work myself up at\r\n     Court, and only to take the command if forced on me as a\r\n     provisional matter, and as a stepping-stone to my real object,\r\n     which was, when my knowledge of the language was perfected, to\r\n     acquire at Peking some such influence as that possessed by\r\n     Verbiest and the other French missionaries in the seventeenth and\r\n     eighteenth centuries. I should never have mentioned this to you\r\n     lest you should not have believed it, but now that the command is\r\n     at my feet I may make this avowal without any hesitation as to\r\n     your accepting it. As you really think I can best succeed to the\r\n     command of the force when you resign it, I am perfectly willing\r\n     to accept the task.\"\r\n\r\nTo which Gordon replied: \"Very well, then. That is settled.\" With this\r\nprivate understanding, as to which nothing has been published until\r\nthis moment, the conversation closed with a final injunction from\r\nGordon of profound secrecy, as, should it become known, he might be\r\nunable to get certain of his more ambitious officers to take part in\r\ncapturing the city. When Gordon therefore turned to Macartney, and\r\nasked him to proceed to the Lar Wang's palace and inform him that the\r\nterms of the convention must be carried out, it is necessary in order\r\nto throw light on what follows to state what their relations were at\r\nthat moment. Gordon had selected Macartney as his successor in\r\npreference to all his own officers.\r\n\r\nMacartney hastened to the Lar Wang's palace, but as he had lent Gordon\r\nhis horse, his movements were slightly retarded. On reaching the\r\nbuilding he noticed some signs of confusion, and when he asked one of\r\nthe attendants to take him at once to his master, he received the\r\nreply that the Lar Wang was out. Sir Halliday Macartney is not a man\r\nto be lightly turned from his purpose, and to this vague response he\r\nspoke in peremptory terms:\r\n\r\n\"The matter is of the first importance. I _must_ see the Lar Wang.\r\nTake me to him.\"\r\n\r\nThen the servant of the Taeping leader did a strange thing.\r\n\r\n\"You _cannot_ see my master,\" he said, and turning his face to the\r\nwall, so that no one else might see, he drew his open hand in a\r\ncutting position backwards and forwards. This is the recognised\r\nChinese mode of showing that a man's head has been cut off.\r\n\r\nBeing thus apprised that something tragic had happened, Macartney\r\nhastened away to Wuliungchow to keep his appointment with Gordon, and\r\nto acquaint him with what had taken place at the Lar Wang's palace.\r\nBut no Gordon came, and more than a day elapsed before Macartney and\r\nhe met again under dramatic circumstances at Quinsan. After waiting at\r\nWuliungchow some hours, Sir Halliday resolved to proceed to the\r\nFutai's camp, and learn there what had happened. But on arriving he\r\nwas informed that the Futai was not in the camp, that no one knew\r\nwhere he was, and that Gordon was in a state of furious wrath at the\r\nmassacre of the Wangs, which was no longer concealed. Macartney then\r\nendeavoured to find Gordon, but did not succeed, which is explained by\r\nthe fact that Gordon was then hastening to Quinsan to collect his own\r\ntroops. Baffled in these attempts, Macartney returned, after a great\r\nmany hours, to his own camp near the Paotichiaou Bridge, there to\r\nawait events, and on his arrival there he at last found the Futai Li\r\nwho had come to him for security. Li put into his hands a letter,\r\nsaying, \"I have received that letter from Gordon. Translate its\r\ncontents.\"\r\n\r\nAfter perusing it, Macartney said: \"This letter is written in a fit of\r\nindignation. You and Gordon are and have been friends, and I am also\r\nthe friend of you both. The most friendly act I can do both of you is\r\nto decline to translate it. Let me therefore return you the letter\r\nunread.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" replied Li; \"do as you think best, but as I am not to\r\nknow the contents, I do not wish to have the letter. Please keep it.\"\r\n\r\nSir Halliday Macartney kept the letter, which remained in his\r\npossession for some time, until, in fact, he handed it, with an\r\nexplanatory account of the whole affair, to Sir Harry Parkes, as will\r\nbe explained further on.\r\n\r\nAfter this point had been settled, Li Hung Chang went on to say that\r\nhe wished Macartney to go and see Gordon at Quinsan, and speak to him\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"Tell Gordon that he is in no way, direct or indirect,\r\n     responsible in this matter, and that, if he considers his honour\r\n     involved, I will sign any proclamation he likes to draft, and\r\n     publish it far and wide that he had no part in or knowledge of\r\n     it. I accept myself the full and sole responsibility for what has\r\n     been done. But also tell Gordon that this is China, not Europe. I\r\n     wished to save the lives of the Wangs, and at first thought that\r\n     I could do so, but they came with their heads unshaved, they used\r\n     defiant language, and proposed a deviation from the convention,\r\n     and I saw that it would not be safe to show mercy to these\r\n     rebels. Therefore what was done was inevitable. But Gordon had no\r\n     part in it, and whatever he demands to clear himself shall be\r\n     done.\"\r\n\r\nI do not gather that Sir Halliday Macartney had any serious misgivings\r\nabout this mission when he undertook it. His relations with Gordon\r\nwere, as has been shown, of a specially cordial and confidential\r\ncharacter, and even if he failed to induce Gordon to abandon the\r\nthreatening plans he had described in his letter to Li Hung Chang,\r\nwhich was in his pocket, there was no reason to apprehend any\r\npersonal unpleasantness with one who had given the clearest proof of\r\nfriendship and esteem. As I cannot give the full text of the original\r\nletter from General Gordon, I content myself by stating that its two\r\nprincipal passages were that Li Hung Chang should at once resign his\r\npost of Governor of Kiangsu, and give up the seals of office to\r\nGordon, so that he might put them in commission until the Emperor's\r\npleasure should be ascertained; or that, failing that step, Gordon\r\nwould forthwith proceed to attack the Imperialists, and to retake from\r\nthem all the places captured by the Ever Victorious Army, for the\r\npurpose of handing them back again to the Taepings. When Gordon went\r\nso far as to write a letter of that character, which, it must be\r\nadmitted, was far in excess of any authority he possessed, it must be\r\nclear that the envoy, who came to put forward counsels that were\r\nintended to restore harmony, but that by so doing might assume the\r\naspect of palliating the Futai's conduct, could not count on a very\r\ncordial reception from a man of Gordon's temperament, whose sense of\r\nhonour and good faith had been deeply injured by the murder of the\r\nrebel leaders.\r\n\r\nStill, Sir Halliday accepted the mission without hesitation, and\r\nhastened to carry it out without delay. It was late in the day when he\r\nsaw Li Hung Chang, but having procured a native boat with several\r\nrowers, he set off in the evening, and reached Quinsan in the middle\r\nof the night. Gordon was then in bed and could not be disturbed, and\r\nwhile Macartney waited he drank some coffee Gordon's servant made for\r\nhim, which he much needed, as he had left Soochow without having\r\nbroken his fast during the whole day. After a short time, and before\r\nday had really broken, Gordon sent down word that he would see him,\r\nand Macartney went upstairs to an ill-lighted room, where he found\r\nGordon sitting on his bedstead. He found Gordon sobbing, and before a\r\nword was exchanged, Gordon stooped down, and taking something from\r\nunder the bedstead, held it up in the air, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\"Do you see that? Do you see that?\"\r\n\r\nThe light through the small Chinese windows was so faint that\r\nMacartney had at first some difficulty in recognising what it was,\r\nwhen Gordon again exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"It is the head of the Lar Wang, foully murdered!\" and with that burst\r\ninto hysterical tears.\r\n\r\nAt once perceiving that any conversation under these circumstances\r\nwould do no good, Macartney said he would retire and see Gordon later.\r\nSome hours afterwards breakfast was served in a large room downstairs,\r\nwhere there were present not only many of the officers, but also\r\nseveral European merchants and traders of Shanghai, who had been in\r\nthe habit of supplying the force with its commissariat requirements.\r\nGordon came in, and Macartney took a seat beside him. After a few\r\nminutes' silence Gordon turned to Macartney, and said abruptly:\r\n\r\n\"You have not come for yourself. You have come on a mission from the\r\nFutai. What is it?\"\r\n\r\nWhen Macartney suggested that so public a place might not be the most\r\nsuitable, Gordon said: \"There are only friends here. I have no\r\nsecrets. Speak out.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no longer any honourable way of avoiding the challenge, and\r\nMacartney described exactly what has been already recorded as to Li\r\nHung Chang having come to him with Gordon's letter, which from\r\nfriendly motives he had declined to translate, and stating that Li\r\ntook the whole responsibility on himself, and would exonerate Gordon\r\nfrom the least complicity in the affair, with which the Chinese\r\nstatesman averred Gordon had had nothing to do. He went on to urge\r\nwith regard to the measures threatened by Gordon in expiation of the\r\nmassacre that they were not justifiable, and would not in the end\r\nredound to Gordon's own credit. In conclusion, he said he felt sure\r\nthat \"a little reflection would show Gordon that to carry on a\r\npersonal war with the Futai would be to undo all the good that had\r\nbeen done. Moreover, you must recollect that although you, no doubt,\r\nhave at this moment the military force to carry out your threats, it\r\nwill no longer be paid by the Chinese authorities. You will only be\r\nable to keep your men at your back by allowing them to plunder, and\r\nhow long will that prove successful, and what credit will you get by\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\nGordon here stamped his foot, saying he would have none of Macartney's\r\nmild counsels. To which Macartney replied, \"Mild or not, they are the\r\nonly ones your Minister at Peking and our Queen will approve. Nay,\r\nwhat I advise you to do is even that you would yourself do if you\r\nwould but reflect, and not let yourself be influenced by those men\r\nsitting at your table.\"\r\n\r\nTo these undoubtedly prudent representations, supported as they were\r\nby at least one of those present, Mr Henry Dent, who got up and said\r\nthat, in his opinion, Dr Macartney's advice ought to be followed,\r\nwhile the others who wished the war to go on from interested motives\r\nremained silent, Gordon did and would not listen. The hot fit of rage\r\nand horror at the treacherous murder of the Wangs, kept at fever-point\r\nby the terrible memorial in his possession, was still strong upon him,\r\nand his angry retort was--\"I will have none of your tame counsels,\"\r\nand there and then ordered the _Hyson_, with a party of infantry, to\r\nbe got ready to attack the Futai, at the same time offering Macartney\r\na passage in the steamer.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this decisive declaration Macartney left the table, and\r\nhastening to one of Gordon's officers, who was a personal friend, he\r\nbegged the loan of a horse and a pair of spurs. Having obtained what\r\nhe wanted, he set off riding as hard as he could by the road, which\r\nwas somewhat shorter than the canal, so that he might warn Li Hung\r\nChang as to what was going to happen, and also bring up his own troops\r\nto oppose the advance of Gordon, who actually did move out of Quinsan\r\nwith the intention of carrying out his threats, but returned there\r\nwhen his flotilla had proceeded half way.\r\n\r\nBy that time he had fortunately reflected on the situation, and a\r\nsanguinary struggle was averted. Gordon came to see that his honour\r\nwas not in the slightest or most remote degree involved, and that\r\nChina was not a country to which the laws of chivalry could be\r\napplied; but before he had reached this stage of mental equilibrium he\r\nhad penned a most regrettable and cruelly unjust despatch, not about\r\nLi Hung Chang or any one involved in the massacre, but about Dr, now\r\nSir Halliday Macartney, whose sole fault had been that he wished to\r\nmake peace, and to advise Gordon to act in the very sense which he\r\nafterwards himself adopted.\r\n\r\nIn a despatch to General Brown, commanding at Shanghai, which appears\r\nin the Blue Book (China, No. 3, 1864, p. 198), Gordon wrote: \"I then\r\nwent to his (Li's) boat and left him a note in English, informing him\r\nof what my intention had been, and also my opinion of his treachery. I\r\nregret to say that Mr Macartney did not think fit to have this\r\ntranslated to him.... On 8th December the Futai sent Mr Macartney to\r\npersuade me that he could not have done otherwise, and I blush to\r\nthink that he could have got an Englishman, late an officer in Her\r\nMajesty's army, to undertake a mission of such a nature.\" This\r\nstatement, appearing in an official publication, has been largely\r\nquoted, especially in Mr Egmont Hake's \"Story of Chinese Gordon,\" and\r\nthe original injury done by Gordon, for which at the time he atoned,\r\nwas thus repeated in an offensive and altogether unjustifiable form\r\ntwenty years after Gordon had stated publicly that he was sorry for\r\nhaving written this passage, and believed that Sir Halliday Macartney\r\nwas actuated by just as noble sentiments as himself.\r\n\r\nIt is not an agreeable task for any biographer to record that his hero\r\nwas in the wrong, but as General Gordon frankly and fully admitted\r\nthat in this matter he was altogether to blame, and as Mr Hake's error\r\nshows that his retractation never obtained that publicity which he\r\nhimself desired, I conceive myself to be carrying out his wishes in\r\nplacing the following facts prominently before the reader.\r\n\r\nWhen the Blue Book was published with the despatch referred to, Dr\r\nMacartney took no notice of it. Some time afterwards he met the late\r\nSir Harry Parkes, then Consul-General at Shanghai, and he described\r\nwhat I have set forth in the same language. Sir Harry Parkes, than\r\nwhom England never had a finer representative in the Far East, at once\r\nsaid: \"This is very interesting. Sir Frederick Bruce is coming down\r\nshortly. I wish you would write out what you have told me, so that I\r\nmight show it to him.\" Dr Macartney wrote out his narrative, and with\r\nit he sent Gordon's original letter to Li Hung Chang. Those documents\r\nhave never been published, but they should still exist in the Shanghai\r\nConsulate. Sir Frederick Bruce's (brother of the ambassador Lord\r\nElgin, and himself the First British Minister at Peking) comment after\r\nperusing them was: \"Dr Macartney showed very great judgment and good\r\nsense, and no blame attaches to him in this matter.\"\r\n\r\nA considerable period intervened between the breakfast scene at\r\nQuinsan and Gordon's next meeting with Macartney. In that period much\r\nhad happened. Gordon had forgiven Li Hung Chang, done everything that\r\nMacartney had recommended as the right course in the memorable scene\r\nat Quinsan, and by some of the most remarkable of his military\r\nexploits had crushed the Taeping rebellion, but the two principal\r\nactors in this affair had not crossed each other's path.\r\n\r\nSix weeks after Gordon brought his operations in the field to an end\r\nat Chanchufu in May he returned to Soochow, and Li Hung Chang, wishing\r\nto do him honour, asked him to an official breakfast at his yamen. At\r\nthe same time Li Hung Chang said to Macartney: \"I have asked Gordon to\r\nbreakfast. I know you and he have had some difference. How would you\r\nmeet him if you came too?\"\r\n\r\nTo this question Macartney replied: \"I would meet Gordon exactly as\r\nGordon met me. It is true that Gordon did me an injustice, but I am\r\nquite ready to blot it out from my memory if Gordon will admit it.\r\nGordon acted under a strong feeling of excitement when he was not\r\nmaster of himself, and I have no more thought of holding him strictly\r\nresponsible for what he wrote at such a moment than I would a madman.\"\r\n\r\nLi Hung Chang said: \"Very well, then. I ask you to come to breakfast\r\nto meet him.\" On Macartney's return to his house he found a letter\r\nfrom Gordon waiting for him. In this letter Gordon admitted that he\r\nhad done him a wrong, and was prepared to sign any paper to that\r\neffect that Macartney might prepare.\r\n\r\nMacartney thereupon replied to Gordon, pointing out that the mere\r\npublication of a letter of retractation was not an adequate reparation\r\nfor an injurious statement which had been given a wide circulation,\r\nand to a certain extent placed beyond recall by appearing in an\r\nofficial publication, but that if he might publish Gordon's own\r\nletter offering to do this in the _North China Herald_, he would be\r\nsatisfied, and the matter, as far as he was concerned, might be\r\nconsidered at an end. To this course Gordon at once acquiesced,\r\nsubject to the omission of one paragraph affecting a third person, and\r\nin no respect relating to Sir Halliday or his conduct. This letter,\r\nwhich the Editor of that paper stated he \"published at Colonel\r\nGordon's request,\" on 23rd July 1864, read as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   \"SHANGHAI, _July 5, 1864_.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR MACARTNEY,--It is with much regret that I perceive in\r\n     the last Blue Book issued on China affairs a Report from me to\r\n     General Brown on the occurrences at Soochow, which report\r\n     contains an injurious remark on your conduct.\r\n\r\n     \"I am extremely sorry that I ever penned that remark, as I\r\n     believe you went out of your way on this occasion wholly on the\r\n     same public grounds which led eventually to my taking the field\r\n     myself, and I can only excuse my having done so by recollecting\r\n     the angry feelings with which I was actuated at that time.\r\n\r\n     \"It will be my duty to rectify this error in other quarters, and\r\n     in the meantime I beg you to make what use you may think fit of\r\n     this letter.--Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                   \"C. G. GORDON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the next day Gordon and Macartney met at breakfast at the yamen of\r\nthe Futai Li Hung Chang, and Gordon at once came up to Macartney and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     \"Do not let us talk of the past, but of the future. I am one of\r\n     those who hold that when a man has wronged another he should seek\r\n     opportunities through his life of making him redress. Now you are\r\n     founding an Arsenal at Soochow, and I am going back to England,\r\n     where I have a brother in the Arsenal at Woolwich. From him I can\r\n     get you books, plans, and useful information. I will do so.\"\r\n\r\nGordon was as good as his word. He sent Macartney expensive plans and\r\nbooks, besides most valuable information. He also promised to write to\r\nthe Duke of Cambridge as Commander-in-Chief, admitting that he was not\r\njustified in his criticism of Dr Macartney, who had acted in every way\r\nbecoming an English gentleman and officer. Thus ended the\r\nmisunderstanding between the two Englishmen who rendered China the\r\nbest service she has ever obtained from foreigners; and knowing both\r\nthese distinguished men intimately, I have much pleasure in testifying\r\nfrom my own knowledge to the accuracy of the following statement of\r\nSir Halliday Macartney to myself that \"after this, Gordon and I\r\nremained firm friends evermore.\"\r\n\r\nGordon's indignation at this outrage did not soon subside, and three\r\nweeks after it happened an opportunity presented itself for showing\r\nand perhaps relieving his mind. A high Chinese officer presented\r\nhimself at his quarters at Quinsan to announce the receipt of an\r\nImperial decree and presents from Peking as a reward for his share in\r\nthe capture of Soochow. Gordon at once said that he would not accept\r\nthe presents, and that they were not to be brought to him. The Chinese\r\nofficer replied that they should not be brought, but that the emissary\r\nof the Emperor ought to be received. To this Gordon assented, and on\r\n1st January 1864 he went down to receive him at the West Gate. On\r\narriving there he met a procession carrying a number of open boxes,\r\ncontaining 10,000 taels (then about L3000 of our money) in Sycee\r\nshoes, laid on red cloth, also four Snake flags taken from the\r\nTaepings--two sent by Li Hung Chang, and two by another mandarin who\r\nhad had no part in the Soochow affair. Gordon made the procession turn\r\nabout and take the whole lot back again. He wrote his reply stating\r\nhis reason on the back of the Imperial rescript itself; he rejected Li\r\nHung Chang's flags, but he accepted the other two as being in no sense\r\nassociated with the disgrace of the Taeping massacre. In this manner\r\ndid Gordon show the Chinese what he thought of their conduct. His\r\ncharacteristic reply to the Imperial rescript read as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"Major Gordon receives the approbation of His Majesty the Emperor\r\n     with every gratification, but regrets most sincerely that, owing\r\n     to the circumstance which occurred since the capture of Soochow,\r\n     he is unable to receive any mark of H.M. the Emperor's\r\n     recognition, and therefore respectfully begs His Majesty to\r\n     receive his thanks for his intended kindness, and to allow him to\r\n     decline the same.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment it will be recollected that Gordon was, strictly\r\nspeaking, no longer in command. He had resigned, because his very\r\nreasonable demand for a gratuity to his troops had not been complied\r\nwith. But circumstances were too strong for him, and a number of\r\nconsiderations, all highly creditable to his judgment and\r\nsingle-mindedness, induced him to sink his private grievances, and to\r\nresume the command on grounds of public policy and safety. The\r\ninternal condition of the Ever Victorious Army itself, which inaction\r\nhad brought to the verge of mutiny, was the determining fact that\r\ninduced Gordon to resume the command, even at the price of meeting Li\r\nHung Chang and sinking his differences with him. There had been much\r\nintrigue among the officers of the force as to who should succeed\r\nGordon in the command, if he persisted in his resolve to give it up,\r\nand before tranquillity was restored sixteen of the agitating officers\r\nhad to be dismissed. The force itself welcomed the formal resumption\r\nof the command by Gordon, and not the less because it signified a\r\nreturn to active operations after more than two months' inaction. The\r\nmurder of the Wangs took place on 7th December 1863; it was on 18th\r\nFebruary 1864 that Gordon marched out of Quinsan at the head of the\r\nbulk of his force.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written at the time, Sir Robert Hart, whose services to\r\nthe Chinese Government, spread over the long period of forty years,\r\nhave been of the highest order and importance, said:--\r\n\r\n     \"The destiny of China is at the present moment in the hands of\r\n     Gordon more than of any other man, and if he be encouraged to act\r\n     vigorously, the knotty question of Taepingdom _versus_ 'union in\r\n     the cause of law and order' will be solved before the end of May,\r\n     and quiet will at length be restored to this unfortunate and\r\n     sorely-tried country. Personally, Gordon's wish is to leave the\r\n     force as soon as he can. Now that Soochow has fallen, there is\r\n     nothing more that he can do, whether to add to his own reputation\r\n     or to retrieve that of British officers generally, tarnished by\r\n     Holland's defeat at Taitsan. He has little or nothing personally\r\n     to gain from future successes, and as he has himself to lead in\r\n     all critical moments, and is constantly exposed to danger, he has\r\n     before him the not very improbable contingency of being hit\r\n     sooner or later. But he lays aside his personal feelings, and\r\n     seeing well that if he were now to leave the force it would in\r\n     all probability go at once to the rebels or cause some other\r\n     disaster, he consents to remain with it for a time.\"\r\n\r\nDuring that interval some minor successes had been obtained by the\r\nImperialists. Several towns surrendered to Li Hung Chang, and Chung\r\nWang evacuated Wusieh and retired to Chanchufu, also on the Grand\r\nCanal. At the same time he hastened himself to Nanking, in the vain\r\nhope of arousing Tien Wang to the gravity of the situation, and\r\ninducing him to make some special effort to turn the fortune of the\r\nwar. General Ching succeeded in capturing Pingwang, and with it\r\nanother entrance into the Taiho Lake. San Tajin moved his camp close\r\nup to Changchufu and engaged the Taepings in almost daily encounters,\r\nduring one of which the _Firefly_ steamer was retaken, and its English\r\ncaptain killed. In consequence of this all the Europeans left the\r\nservice of the Taepings, and as their fleet had been almost entirely\r\ndestroyed, they were now hemmed in within a small compass, and Gordon\r\nhimself estimated that they ought to be finally overcome within two\r\nmonths. In this hope he resumed the command, and his decision was\r\nofficially approved of and confirmed by the British Minister at\r\nPeking.\r\n\r\nThe Taepings still retained possession of Hangchow and some other\r\ntowns in the province of Chekiang, but all communication between them\r\nand Nanking had been severed by the fall of Soochow, so far at least\r\nas the routes east of the Taiho Lake were concerned. West of that lake\r\nthey still held Yesing and Liyang, which enabled them to maintain\r\ncommunication, although by a roundabout route. Gordon determined to\r\nbegin his campaign by attacking these two places, when the severance\r\nwould be complete.\r\n\r\nYesing, on the north-west corner of the lake, was the first object of\r\nattack. Liyang is about fifty miles further inland than that town. The\r\nTaepings at Yesing were not dreaming of an attack when Gordon, at the\r\nhead of his force, suddenly appeared before its walls. He found the\r\nsurrounding villages in a most appalling state of distress, the\r\ninhabitants living on human food. The town was well surrounded by\r\nditches and stockades, and Gordon felt compelled to reconnoitre it\r\nmost carefully before deciding on his plan of attack. While engaged in\r\nthis work his ardour carried him away, and he was nearly captured by\r\nthe enemy. It was one of the narrowest of his many escapes during the\r\nwar, and went far to justify the reputation he had gained of having a\r\ncharmed life. A very striking instance of his narrowly escaping a\r\npremature end had occurred during the siege of Soochow itself, when\r\nthe marvellous fifty-three-arch bridge at Patachiaou was destroyed.\r\nOne evening Gordon was seated smoking a cigar on one of the damaged\r\nparapets of the bridge, when two shots fired by his own men struck the\r\nstone-work close by him. He got down at the second shot, and entered\r\nhis boat. Hardly had he done so when the bridge collapsed with a\r\ntremendous crash, nearly smashing his boat and killing two men. In all\r\nthe engagements, except when confined to his boat, Gordon always led\r\nthe attack, carrying no weapons, except a revolver which he wore\r\nconcealed in his breast, and never used except once, against one of\r\nhis own mutineers, but only a little rattan cane, which his men called\r\nhis magic wand of Victory. A graphic picture was drawn by one of his\r\nown officers of this unarmed leader in the breach of an assaulted\r\nposition urging on his men by catching them by the sleeve of their\r\ncoats, and by standing indifferent and unresisting in the midst of the\r\nthickest fire. Gordon long afterwards admitted that during the whole\r\nof these scenes he was continuously praying to the Almighty that his\r\nmen should not turn tail. In the varied and voluminous annals of war\r\nthere is no more striking figure than this of human heroism combined\r\nwith spiritual fervour.\r\n\r\nThe attack on Yesing lasted several days, as, owing to the manner in\r\nwhich the country was cut up by canals, all the operations had to be\r\nconducted with great caution. The capture of the southern stockades\r\nwas followed after a day's interval by the evacuation of the latter\r\nand the flight of the garrison, who however pillaged the town as far\r\nas they could before leaving. Gordon would not let his men enter the\r\ntown, as he knew they would pillage, and thus get out of hand. They\r\nwere so disappointed that several cases of insubordination occurred,\r\nand one mutineer had to be shot. The Imperialists were left to\r\ngarrison Yesing, but under strict injunctions that they were on no\r\naccount to take life; and under the threats of Li Hung Chang, who did\r\nnot wish a repetition of the Soochow affair, these were strictly\r\nobeyed. All these arrangements having been made, Gordon resumed his\r\nmarch towards Liyang on 4th March, the infantry proceeding overland,\r\nand the artillery in the boats and _Hyson_ steamer.\r\n\r\nAt Liyang the rebels had collected a large force, and made every\r\npreparation for a vigorous defence. But Gordon was quite confident of\r\nsuccess, although he was now operating in the heart of a hostile\r\ncountry, and at a distance from his base. The sound flotilla which\r\nmounted formidable artillery, and which co-operated with him on the\r\ncreek that led to the walls of Liyang, gave him sound reasons for\r\nconfidence, and additional ground of security in the event of any\r\naccident. But his military skill and careful arrangements were not\r\nsubjected to any severe test, as a mutiny broke out among the Taepings\r\nthemselves, and the half in favour of surrender got possession of the\r\ncity, and closed the gates on those of their comrades who wished to\r\nhold out. Major Gordon promptly accepted their surrender, and\r\nguaranteed their personal safety to all, thus obtaining a signal\r\nsuccess without any loss. This was the more satisfactory because\r\nLiyang was found to be an admirable position for defence, strongly\r\nfortified with numerous stockades, well supplied with provisions for\r\nseveral months' siege, and garrisoned by 15,000 well-armed and\r\nwell-clothed rebels. These men were disarmed, and allowed to go where\r\nthey liked after they had shaved their heads in token of surrender.\r\nThe provisions they had stored up for their own use were distributed\r\namong the starving peasants of the surrounding country. Gordon himself\r\nsaved the lives of the female relatives of the Taeping Wang, who had\r\nwished to hold out, not however, it should in fairness be stated, from\r\nthe official Chinese, but from the Taepings who had surrendered. After\r\nthe capitulation was over, Gordon took 1000 of the Taepings into his\r\nown force, and he also engaged the services of another 1500 as a new\r\ncontingent, to fight under their own officers. In this unusual manner\r\nhe nearly doubled the effective strength of his own corps, and then\r\nadvanced north to attack the town of Kintang, rather more than forty\r\nmiles north of Liyang. At this point Gordon experienced his first\r\nserious rebuff at the hands of Fortune, for the earlier reverse at the\r\nSoochow stockades was so clearly due to a miscarriage in the attack,\r\nand so ephemeral in its issue, that it can scarcely be counted.\r\n\r\nUnlike the other Taeping towns, all of which were stockaded\r\npositions, Kintang had no outer defences. It presented the appearance\r\nof a small compact city with a stone wall. No flags were shown; the\r\nplace might have been deserted, but the complete silence seemed\r\nominous. Gordon selected his point of attack, and began a bombardment,\r\nwhich continued during three hours, and then he ordered the assault.\r\nAs the bugles sounded the advance, the Taepings appeared for the first\r\ntime on the walls, and received the assailants with a heavy fire. At\r\nthis critical moment Gordon received a severe wound below the knee,\r\nand had to be carried to his boat. His place was taken by Major Brown,\r\nbrother of the General commanding at Shanghai, who advanced waving\r\nGordon's own flag, but he too received a severe wound, and was carried\r\noff the field. The rebels fought with great desperation, and Gordon,\r\nwho remained conscious, sent orders from his boat for the\r\ndiscontinuance of the attack. The loss was heavy--two officers killed,\r\neleven wounded, and 115 rank and file killed and wounded. Gordon,\r\nnotwithstanding his wound, would have renewed the attack, but for the\r\nreceipt of alarming intelligence from his rear. Li Hung Chang wrote\r\nthat the Taepings had turned the flank of his brother's army, and\r\ncaptured Fushan. They were at that moment besieging Chanzu, and had\r\ncarried terror into the very heart of the Imperial position. Gordon's\r\nwound--the only one of any severity he ever received--excited much\r\nsympathy among the Chinese, and was made the subject of an Imperial\r\nedict ordering Li Hung Chang to call on him daily, and \"requesting\r\nGordon to wait until he shall be perfectly restored to health and\r\nstrength.\"\r\n\r\nIn the extremity to which he was reduced, the brilliant idea had\r\noccurred to Chung Wang to assume the offensive at a point most remote\r\nfrom the scene where Gordon was acting in person. Hence the sudden and\r\nsuccessful attack on Fushan, and his strategy was rewarded by the\r\nparalysis it produced in the Imperial plans. Gordon at once hastened\r\nback to Liyang, where he left a strong garrison, and taking only 1000\r\nmen, half of whom were the irregular Taeping contingent raised at\r\nLiyang itself, proceeded by forced marches to Wusieh. As the late Sir\r\nGeorge Chesney well said, it is impossible to decide whether the\r\ntemerity or the confidence of the young wounded commander was the more\r\ncalculated to excite wonder. On arriving here, he found that nothing\r\nworse had happened than what had been already reported, while in the\r\nsouth, beyond his sphere of operations, the important city of Hangchow\r\nhad been evacuated by the Taepings; and with this loss another avenue\r\nfor obtaining arms and ammunition was closed to them.\r\n\r\nThe relief of Kongyin, which was hard pressed, was the first task\r\nGordon set himself; and as he could not leave his boat on account of\r\nhis wound, the conduct of operations was attended with much\r\ndifficulty. After obtaining several minor successes, and approaching\r\nto within a few miles of Kongyin, Gordon found it necessary to\r\ncompletely alter his plans, and to attack the Taepings in their\r\nheadquarters at Waisso, before relieving the former place. He\r\naccordingly proceeded to Waisso with his artillery on board the\r\nflotilla, and his infantry marching by land. The latter, carried away\r\nby some trifling successes, attacked the Waisso stockades without his\r\norders, and even without his knowledge; and having invited a reverse\r\nby their rashness and disobedience, rendered it complete by an\r\ninexcusable panic, during which the Taeping cavalry, not more than 100\r\nstrong, rode through the best regiment of the force; the rebels,\r\ncarrying a sword in each hand, cut down the fugitives right and left.\r\nThe pursuit lasted for three miles, and 7 European officers killed, 1\r\nwounded, 252 men killed, and 62 wounded, represented the heavy loss in\r\nthis disastrous affair. The survivors, many of whom had thrown away\r\ntheir arms, were so panic-stricken that Gordon had to retire, and to\r\nsummon up fresh troops.\r\n\r\nFor this disaster Gordon held the officers, and not the men, to be\r\nblameworthy. They led the men into a false position, and then did not\r\nmake the proper movements. If the men had only formed square, Gordon\r\nwrote, it would have been all right with them. After this Gordon\r\nwaited to allow of his wound being thoroughly cured, and on 6th April\r\nhe again appeared before Waisso. A large Imperial force also enveloped\r\nthe place on all sides but one, which had been left apparently open\r\nand unguarded in the hope that the garrison would use it as a means of\r\nreaching a place of safety. The Imperialists had, however, broken all\r\nthe bridges along this route, so that the Taepings would soon\r\nencounter serious difficulties to their progress, and admit of their\r\nbeing taken at a great disadvantage. Gordon approached the place with\r\nmuch caution, and he found it so strongly fortified on the south side,\r\nopposite his line of approach, that he moved round to the north in\r\nsearch of a more favourable point of attack. This simple manoeuvre so\r\ndisconcerted the Taepings that they abandoned several of their\r\nstockades, which Gordon promptly seized; and finding that these in\r\nturn commanded others, he succeeded in carrying the whole of a most\r\nformidable position with little or no loss. The Taeping garrison fled\r\nin confusion and suffered heavily at the hands of the Imperial troops.\r\nIt rallied on the camp before Kongyin, and the day after this success\r\nGordon marched from Waisso to attack them. The Taepings were\r\nthoroughly disorganised, and apparently amazed at the number of their\r\nopponents, for the whole of the population rose against them in\r\nrevenge for the outrages they had perpetrated. There was only one\r\naction, and that of an insignificant description, when the whole\r\nTaeping force before Kongyin broke into a rout. The Imperialist plan\r\nfor retarding their retreat succeeded to admiration, and of more than\r\n10,000 men not a tenth escaped from the sword of their pursuers.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written at this time to his mother, Gordon, who, at the\r\nend of February had been raised to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in\r\nthe army for distinguished conduct in the field, gave a graphic\r\naccount of the condition of the region in which he was operating:--\r\n\r\n     \"The rebels are very much pressed, and three months should finish\r\n     them. During the pursuit from Kongyin the Imperialists and\r\n     villagers killed in one village 3000. I will say this much--the\r\n     Imperialists did not kill the coolies and boys. The villagers\r\n     followed up and stripped the fugitives stark naked, so that all\r\n     over the country there were naked men lying down in the grass.\r\n     The cruelties these rebels had committed during their raid were\r\n     frightful; in every village there were from ten to sixty dead,\r\n     either women--frightfully mutilated--old men, or small children.\r\n     I do not regret the fate of these rebels. I have no talent for\r\n     description, but the scenes I have witnessed of misery are\r\n     something dreadful, and I must say that your wish for me to\r\n     return with the work incomplete would not be expressed if you saw\r\n     the state of these poor people. The horrible furtive looks of the\r\n     wretched inhabitants hovering around one's boat haunts me, and\r\n     the knowledge of their want of nourishment would sicken anyone.\r\n     They are like wolves. The dead lie where they fall, and are in\r\n     some cases trodden quite flat by the passers-by. I hope to get\r\n     the Shanghai people to assist, but they do not _see_ these\r\n     things, and to _read_ that there are human beings eating human\r\n     flesh produces less effect than if they saw the corpses from\r\n     which that flesh is cut. There is one thing I promise you, and\r\n     that is, that as soon as I can leave this service, I will do so;\r\n     but I will not be led to do what may cause great disasters for\r\n     the sake of getting out of the dangers, which, in my opinion, are\r\n     no greater in action than in barracks. My leg is all right; the\r\n     eleventh day after I received the wound I was up, and by the\r\n     fifteenth day I could walk well. The ball went through the thick\r\n     part of the leg, just below the knee.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus cleared the district due north of Wusieh, Gordon proceeded\r\nagainst the main Taeping position at Chanchufu, north-west of that\r\nplace, and on the Grand Canal. Here Chung Wang had fortified thirty\r\nstockades, and commanded in person. On inspecting it, Gordon found it\r\nso strong that he summoned up his troops from Liyang, and it was not\r\nuntil 22nd April, ten days after Waisso, that he had collected all his\r\nforce of 4000 men for the attack. On the very day he accomplished this\r\nthe Imperialists alone attacked some stockades outside the West Gate,\r\nand carried them by a heavy and unnecessary loss of life. Their\r\ndefenders, instead of retreating into Chanchufu, fled northwards to\r\ntheir next possession, at Tayan. The same night part of the garrison\r\nleft behind made a _sortie_, but Gordon was apprised of it, and it was\r\neasily repulsed. The next day he captured all the stockades on the\r\nsouthern, or, more correctly, the western side of the Canal, but the\r\nTaepings still held a strong stone fort on the opposite side, which\r\ndefied all the efforts of the Imperialists. Two hundred of the Liyang\r\ncorps gallantly crossed the Canal in boats, forced open the back door\r\nof the fort, and carried it at a rush. With this success all the\r\noutworks of Chanchufu were taken, and the town itself closely\r\nbesieged. Gordon then proceeded to plant his batteries opposite the\r\npoint he had selected for attack, but a regrettable affair happened in\r\nthe night, when the picket on guard fired into the party working at\r\nthe battery, and killed Colonel Tapp, an excellent officer who\r\ncommanded the artillery of the force. This mishap was quickly followed\r\nby others. The Imperialists under their own generals wished to get all\r\nthe credit of the capture, and attacked several times on their own\r\nside, but always without obtaining any advantage. Nor was Gordon\r\nhimself more fortunate. After a severe bombardment, to which the\r\nTaepings made no reply, Gordon assaulted on 27th April. His men\r\nsucceeded in throwing two pontoons across the ditch, twenty yards\r\nwide, and some of his officers reached the wall; but the Taepings met\r\nthem boldly with a terrific storm of fire-balls, bags of powder,\r\nstinkpots, and even showers of bricks. Twice did Gordon lead his men\r\nto the assault, but he had to admit his repulse with the loss of his\r\npontoons, and a great number of his best officers and men. Ten\r\nofficers killed and 19 wounded, 40 men killed and 260 wounded,\r\nrepresented the cost of this disastrous failure.\r\n\r\nUndaunted by this defeat, Gordon proceeded to lay siege in regular\r\nform, and Li Hung Chang lent him the services of his own troops in\r\norder to dig the necessary trenches. Working only at night, and with\r\nequal celerity and secrecy, a succession of trenches were made right\r\nup to the edge of the ditch. At the same time, proclamations in large\r\ncharacters were exhibited, offering terms to all who came over, except\r\nthe Wang in command; and many desertions took place. At last, on 11th\r\nMay, the place was again assaulted, this time at mid-day; and owing to\r\nthe short distance from the advance trench to the breach, the Chinese\r\ntroops of all kinds were able to come to close fighting with the\r\nTaepings without any preliminary loss. The Taepings fought with great\r\ncourage, even although their chief Hoo Wang was taken prisoner early\r\nin the fight, but at last they were overwhelmed by numbers. Hoo Wang\r\nand all the Canton and Kwangsi men--that is to say, the original\r\nTaeping band--were executed, and the completeness of the triumph was\r\ndemonstrated by the surrender, two days later, of Tayan, the last of\r\nthe Taeping possessions on the Grand Canal. On the spur of the moment,\r\ntwo hours after the successful assault, Gordon wrote a hurried few\r\nlines to his mother, stating, to relieve her anxiety, that he would\r\n\"not again take the field,\" and that he was happy to say he had \"got\r\noff safe.\"\r\n\r\nThe capture of Chanchufu was the last achievement of the Ever\r\nVictorious Army, which marched back to Quinsan, its headquarters, in\r\npreparation for its disbandment, which had been decided on by the\r\njoint conclusion of the Chinese and European authorities. It had done\r\nits work, and the Chinese naturally regarded the presence of this\r\nformidable and somewhat unruly force with no little apprehension. The\r\nTaepings were now confined to Nanking, and the Viceroy, Tseng Kwofan,\r\nfelt confident that before long he would be able to capture that city.\r\nThe British Government had decided that the service of Major Gordon\r\nunder the Chinese should terminate on 1st June 1864, and some weeks\r\nbefore that order was put in force the army was quietly disbanded,\r\nwithout any disturbance or display. The troops themselves would have\r\ngiven their commander a demonstration, but he evaded them, and escaped\r\nquietly into Shanghai, passing without regret from the position of the\r\narbiter of an Empire's destiny to the routine of an English officer's\r\nexistence. At the same time a considerable part of his force was taken\r\ninto the service of Li Hung Chang.\r\n\r\nGordon's own opinion of his work was given in the following letter:--\r\n\r\n     \"I have the satisfaction of knowing that the end of this\r\n     rebellion is at hand, while, had I continued inactive, it might\r\n     have lingered on for years. I do not care a jot about my\r\n     promotion or what people may say. I know I shall leave China as\r\n     poor as I entered it, but with the knowledge that, through my\r\n     weak instrumentality, upwards of eighty to one hundred thousand\r\n     lives have been spared. I want no further satisfaction than\r\n     this.\"\r\n\r\nHaving retired from the active direction of the campaign, Gordon still\r\nretained sufficient interest in the work he had had in hand so long to\r\nincline him to accept an invitation to visit the lines of Tseng Kwofan\r\nbefore Nanking. On 26th June he visited that Viceroy's camp, and found\r\nthat his position extended over from twenty-four to thirty miles, and\r\nthat he commanded 80,000 troops, who were, however, badly armed. The\r\ntroops were well fed, but ill paid, and at last confident of success.\r\nWhile Gordon was there, or only a few hours after he left, Tien Wang,\r\nthe leader of the moribund Taeping cause, seeing no chance of escape,\r\nswallowed gold leaf in the approved regal fashion, and died. On the\r\n19th July the Imperialists succeeded in running a gallery under the\r\nwall of Nanking, and in charging it with 40,000 lbs. of powder. The\r\nexplosion destroyed fifty yards of the wall, and the Imperialists at\r\nonce stormed the breach. Chung Wang made a valiant defence in his own\r\npalace, and then cut his way out, at the head of 1000 men. Very few of\r\nthese escaped, but Chung Wang and the young Tien Wang, son of the\r\ndefunct leader, were among the fortunate few. Chung Wang was soon\r\ncaptured, and beheaded on 7th August, after being allowed a week's\r\nrespite to write the history of the Taeping rebellion. At least it may\r\nbe claimed for him that he was the only true hero of the rebel\r\nmovement. Gordon's own estimation of this leader is given in these\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n     \"He was the bravest, most talented, and enterprising leader the\r\n     rebels had. He had been in more engagements than any other rebel\r\n     leader, and could always be distinguished. His presence with the\r\n     Taepings was equal to a reinforcement of 5000 men, and was always\r\n     felt by the superior way in which the rebels resisted. He was the\r\n     only rebel chief whose death was to be regretted; the others, his\r\n     followers, were a ruthless set of bandit chiefs.\"\r\n\r\nThe young Tien Wang was eventually captured and executed. Thus\r\nterminated, in the blood of its authors and leaders, the great\r\nrebellion, which had inflicted an incalculable amount of misery and\r\nloss on the Chinese people in a vain attempt to subvert the existing\r\ndynasty. Six hundred cities were stated to have been destroyed during\r\nits course, and sixteen out of the eighteen provinces to have\r\nwitnessed the ravages of civil war.\r\n\r\nHaving thus concluded his work as commander of the Ever Victorious\r\nArmy, it might have been thought that Gordon would be allowed to carry\r\nout his own wish of returning home as quickly as possible, but the\r\nEnglish, as well as the Chinese, authorities were desirous of\r\norganising a purely Chinese force, with the object of supplying the\r\nGovernment with the means of asserting its authority over any internal\r\nenemies. Sir Frederick Bruce came specially from Pekin to Shanghai on\r\nthe subject, and Gordon undertook to give the necessary organisation\r\nhis personal supervision until it was in fair working order. From the\r\nend of June until the middle of November Colonel Gordon was engaged in\r\nthe Chinese camp, which was formed at a place near Sungkiang, drilling\r\nrecruits, and endeavouring to inspire the officers with the military\r\nspirit. He describes his work in the following short note, which is\r\nalso interesting as expressing his impressions about the Chinese\r\npeople:--\r\n\r\n     \"I have the manual, and platoon, and company drill in full swing,\r\n     also part of the battalion drill, and one or two men know their\r\n     gun drill very fairly. This is so far satisfactory, and I think,\r\n     if the whole country was not corrupt, they might go on well and\r\n     quickly, but really it is most irritating to see the jealousies\r\n     of the mandarins of one another. The people are first-rate,\r\n     hard-working, and fairly honest; but it seems as soon as they\r\n     rise in office they become corrupt. There is lots of vitality in\r\n     the country, and there are some good men; but these are kept down\r\n     by the leaden apathy of their equals, who hate to see reform,\r\n     knowing their own deficiencies.\"\r\n\r\nBy the end of November Gordon was able to think of returning home, as\r\nhe had given a start to military reform in China; but before he sailed\r\nhe had to receive a congratulatory address from the most prominent\r\ncitizens and merchants of Shanghai, expressing their \"appreciation and\r\nadmiration of his conduct.\" They had not always been so\r\ndiscriminating, and at the beginning their sympathies had been for the\r\nTaepings, or at least for strict non-intervention. The Chinese\r\nGovernment also gave exceptional signs of its gratitude to the\r\nnoble-minded soldier, who had rendered it such invaluable aid. It\r\nagain offered him a large sum of money, which was declined with as\r\nmuch firmness, although less emphasis, as on the earlier occasion. But\r\nhe could not reject the promotion offered him to the high rank of\r\nTi-Tu, or Field Marshal in the Chinese army, or churlishly refuse to\r\nreceive the rare and high dignity of the Yellow Jacket. The English\r\nreader has been inclined on occasion to smile and sneer at that\r\nhonour, but its origin was noble, and the very conditions on which it\r\nwas based ensured that the holders should be very few in number.\r\n\r\nThe story of its origin will admit of being retold. When the Manchus\r\nconquered China, in the middle of the seventeenth century, they\r\nreceived material aid from a Chinese soldier named Wou Sankwei. He was\r\nrewarded with the Viceroyalty of the whole of south-western China, in\r\nwhich region he became supreme. After many years the Manchus thought\r\nhe posed with too great an air of independence, and he was summoned to\r\nPeking to give an account of his stewardship. But Wou Sankwei was too\r\nold to be caught by so simple a ruse. He defied the Manchus, and\r\nestablished his authority throughout the larger part of the country\r\nsouth of the Great River. The young and afterwards illustrious Emperor\r\nKanghi threw himself into the struggle with ardour, and it continued\r\nfor many years, and devastated almost as large an area as did the\r\nTaeping rebellion. Kanghi did not obtain a decisive triumph until\r\nafter the death of Wou Sankwei, when he bestowed a yellow riding\r\njacket and an ornament of peacock's feathers for the cap on his\r\nprincipal lieutenants. He also decreed that this decoration should be\r\nmade a regular order, to be conferred only on generals who had led\r\nvictorious armies against rebel forces. Gordon was thus perfectly\r\nqualified to receive the order founded by the famous Manchu\r\ncontemporary of the Grand Monarque.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government also sent him six mandarin dresses in the\r\ncorrect fashion for a commanding officer of the rank of Ti-Tu, and a\r\nbook explaining how they should be worn. Gordon said very little about\r\nit, his only comment being: \"Some of the buttons on the mandarin hats\r\nare worth thirty or forty pounds. I am sorry for it, as they cannot\r\nafford it over well; it is, at any rate, very civil of them.\" The two\r\nEmpress Regents also struck a heavy gold medal in his honour, the\r\ndestination of which will be told hereafter, and Li Hung Chang did\r\neverything possible to demonstrate the respect and regard he\r\nentertained for his European colleague. That that was no transitory\r\nfeeling was well shown thirty-two years later, when the famous Chinese\r\nstatesman seized the occasion of his visit to London to place wreaths\r\non the statue and cenotaph of his old comrade in arms. General Gordon\r\nvalued the Yellow Jacket and the Gold Medal very highly. When he gave\r\nup the medal for the cause of charity he felt its loss keenly, and it\r\nbecame a phrase with him to signify the height of self-sacrifice to\r\nsay, \"You must give up your medal.\" Prince Kung, in a special and\r\nremarkable despatch to the British Minister, narrated in detail the\r\nachievements of Gordon, and declared in graceful language that \"not\r\nonly has he shown himself throughout both brave and energetic, but his\r\nthorough appreciation of that important question, a friendly\r\nunderstanding between China and foreign nations, is also deserving of\r\nthe highest praise.\" The Minister was requested to bring these facts\r\nto the notice of the British Government, and it was even suggested by\r\nthe Chinese Prince that some reward that Gordon would appreciate at\r\nthe hands of his own Sovereign should be conferred on him, and would\r\nbe hailed with satisfaction in China. If I add to this list the sword\r\nof Chung Wang, captured from one of his lieutenants, and presented\r\nafterwards by Gordon to the Duke of Cambridge, the rewards of Gordon\r\nfrom the Chinese are fully catalogued. At the hands of his own\r\nGovernment he received for his magnificent service a brevet\r\nlieutenant-colonelcy, and somewhat later the Companionship of the\r\nBath.\r\n\r\nGordon had kept a journal, which he sent home; but subsequently, on\r\nfinding that it was being circulated, he destroyed it. Of this fact\r\nthere is no doubt, and it is of course impossible to say whether it\r\ncontained more than the manuscript history of the Taeping war, which\r\nhe lent me in 1881 as \"a trustworthy narrative\" for the purposes of my\r\n\"History of China,\" and which was published many years later as a\r\nseparate volume. The authorship of that history is a matter of\r\nspeculation, but there seems little or no doubt that it was at least\r\ncompiled under Gordon's own direction, from the reports of his\r\nlieutenants in China, and completed during his residence at Gravesend.\r\n\r\nOf the true personal journal Gordon wrote in 1864: \"I do not want the\r\nsame published, as I think, if my proceedings sink into oblivion, it\r\nwould be better for every one; and my reason for this is that it is a\r\nvery contested point whether we ought to have interfered or not, on\r\nwhich point I am perfectly satisfied that it was the proper and humane\r\ncourse to pursue, but I still do not expect people who do not know\r\nmuch about it to concur in the same.... I never want anything\r\npublished. I am sure it does no good, and makes people chary of\r\nwriting.\"\r\n\r\nThe same feeling came out in his last letter to his mother from China,\r\n17th November 1864: \"The individual is coming home, but does not wish\r\nit known, for it would be a signal for the disbanded to come to\r\nSouthampton, and although the waits at Christmas are bad, these others\r\nare worse.\" Such a wish as this was impossible of gratification. The\r\npublic press could not be silenced by the modesty of this retiring\r\ncommander whose deeds had been so heroic and devoid of selfish\r\npurpose. The papers became so filled with accounts of his achievements\r\nthat he gave up reading them, but _The Times_ had at least\r\ncrystallised the opinion of the day into a single sentence: \"Never did\r\nsoldier of fortune deport himself with a nicer sense of military\r\nhonour, with more gallantry against the resisting, and with more mercy\r\ntowards the vanquished, with more disinterested neglect of\r\nopportunities of personal advantage, or with more entire devotion to\r\nthe objects and desires of his own Government, than this officer who,\r\nafter all his victories, has just laid down his sword.\"\r\n\r\nThe more calmly and critically the deeds of the Ever Victorious Army\r\nand Gordon's conduct during the campaign against the Taepings are\r\nconsidered, the greater will be the credit awarded to the high-minded,\r\nbrave, and unselfish man who then gained the sobriquet of \"Chinese\"\r\nGordon. Among all the deeds of his varied and remarkable career he\r\nnever succeeded in quite the same degree in winning fame and in\r\ncommanding success. At Khartoum the eyes of the world were on him, but\r\nthe Mahdi was allowed to remain victorious, and the Soudan still\r\nawaits fresh conquest. But during the two Taeping campaigns he was\r\ncompletely successful, and closed his work with an unqualified\r\ntriumph. It was also the only occasion when he led an army in the\r\nfield, and proved his claims to be considered a great commander. Of\r\nserious warfare it may be said to have been his last experience, for\r\nhis own Government was very careful to give him no active military\r\nemployment--garrison, and even consular duties being deemed more\r\nsuitable for this victorious leader than the conduct of any of those\r\nlittle expeditions commencing with the Red River and Ashanti for which\r\nhe was pre-eminently qualified--and under the Khedive he controlled an\r\narmy without finding a real foe. Gordon's title to rank among skilful\r\nmilitary commanders rests on his conduct at the head of the Ever\r\nVictorious Army during the Taeping war. It has earned the praise of\r\nmany competent military authorities as well as the general admiration\r\nof the public, and Lord Wolseley must have had it in his mind when, in\r\nvindicating his sanity, he exclaimed that he \"wished other English\r\ngenerals had been bitten with his madness.\"\r\n\r\nThose who have thought that Gordon won his victories in China by sheer\r\npersonal gallantry, and nothing else, have taken a very shallow view\r\nof the case, and not condescended to study the details. In his general\r\nconception of the best way to overcome the Taepings he was necessarily\r\nhampered by the views, wishes, jealousies, and self-seeking purposes\r\nof his Chinese colleagues. But for them, his strategy would have been\r\nof a very different character, as he himself often said. He had to\r\nadjust his means to the best attainable end, and it must be allowed\r\nthat he did this with remarkable tact and patience--the very qualities\r\nin which he was naturally most deficient. If we consider his strategy\r\nas being thus fettered by the Chinese officials Li Hung Chang and\r\nGeneral Ching, whose first object was not so much the overthrow of the\r\nTaeping Government as the expulsion of the Taepings from the province\r\nfor which they were responsible, it will be admitted that nothing\r\ncould be better than his conception of what had to be done, and how it\r\nwas to be effected. The campaign resolved itself into the cutting off\r\nof all their sources of supply from the sea and Treaty ports, and the\r\nshutting up of their principal force within the walls of Soochow. How\r\nwell and successfully that was accomplished has been narrated, but a\r\nvainglorious commander could not have been held back after the fall of\r\nChanchufu from leading his victorious force to achieve a crowning\r\ntriumph at Nanking, which Gordon could easily have carried by assault\r\nbefore the order in council withdrawing his services came into effect.\r\n\r\nMore frequent opportunity was afforded for Gordon to reveal his\r\ntactical skill than his strategical insight, and in this respect the\r\nonly trammels he experienced were from the military value and\r\nefficiency of his force, which had its own limitations. But still it\r\nwould be unjust to form too poor an estimate of the fighting\r\nefficiency and courage of either Gordon's force or his Taeping\r\nopponents from the miserable exhibition the Chinese recently made of\r\nthemselves during the war with Japan. The heavy losses incurred, the\r\nseveral repulses Gordon himself experienced, would alone tell a\r\ndifferent tale, if there were not the obstinate resistance offered to\r\nGeneral Staveley and the French by the Taepings to show that they were\r\nnot altogether contemptible adversaries. Gordon himself thought that\r\nhis force could fight very well, and that his officers, if somewhat\r\nlacking in polish, were not to be surpassed in dash and devilry. For\r\nthe Taepings, especially behind walls, and when it was impossible to\r\nout-manoeuvre them, he had also the highest opinion, and his first\r\nobject on every occasion was to discover a weak point in their\r\nposition, and his patience and perspicuity were generally rewarded.\r\nThe very first step he took on approaching any place that he had to\r\nattack was to reconnoitre it himself, either on foot or in one of his\r\nsteamers, and he wrote a powerful despatch pointing out the general\r\nneglect of this precaution in the conduct of our Eastern campaigns,\r\nwith its inevitable heavy attendant loss of precious lives. As he\r\ntruly said, a careful reconnaissance generally revealed points of\r\nweakness in the enemy's position, and the Taepings, like all Asiatics,\r\nwere easily demoralised when their line of retreat was threatened, or\r\nwhen attacked at some point where their preparations had not been\r\nperfected. Among his own personal qualifications, his untiring energy\r\nand his exceptional promptitude in coming to a decision were the most\r\nremarkable. No exertion relaxed his effort or diminished his ardour,\r\nand in face of fresh perils and disappointments he was always ready\r\nwith a new plan, or prepared with some scheme for converting defeat\r\ninto victory. One of his chief characteristics was his quickness in\r\nseeing an alternative course of action when his original plan had\r\neither failed or been thwarted by others. Of his personal courage and\r\ndaring sufficient instances have been given to justify the assertion\r\nthat in those qualities he was unsurpassable; and if he had never done\r\nanything else than lead the Ever Victorious Army, it would be\r\nsufficient to secure him a place among the most remarkable of English\r\nsoldiers. In China he will be remembered for his rare self-abnegation,\r\nfor his noble disdain of money, and for the spirit of tolerance with\r\nwhich he reconciled the incompatible parts of \"a British officer and a\r\nChinese mandarin.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nGRAVESEND AND GALATZ.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the exciting and eventful ten years which began in the Crimea\r\nand ended in China, the most tranquil period in Gordon's career\r\nfollows, until he was once again launched on the stormy sea of public\r\naffairs in Africa. He used to speak of the six years following his\r\nreturn from the Far East as the happiest of his life, and by a\r\nfortunate although unusual coincidence the details of his existence\r\nduring the tranquil and uneventful period have been preserved with\r\ngreat amplitude and fidelity by several witnesses associated with him\r\nin his beneficent as well as his official work. It would be easy to\r\nfill a small volume with these particulars, which have been already\r\ngiven to the world, but here it will suffice to furnish a summary\r\nsufficient to bring out the philanthropic side of his character, and\r\nto explain how and why it came to be thought that Gordon was the man\r\nto solve that ever-pressing but ever-put-off problem of diminishing\r\nthe pressure of excessive population and poverty in the eastern\r\ndistricts of London.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gordon arrived in England early in 1865, and proceeded to join\r\nhis family at Rockstone Place, Southampton, where he was then doubly\r\nwelcomed, as his father was in declining health, and died soon\r\nafterwards. Here Gordon passed a quiet six months, refusing all\r\ninvitations with extreme modesty, and in every way baffling the\r\nattempts of relations, friends, and admirers to make a lion of him. He\r\nwould not permit anyone to say that his suppression of the Taeping\r\nrebellion was a marvellous feat, and he evaded and resented all the\r\nattempts made by those in power to bring him into prominence as a\r\nnational hero. Modesty is becoming as an abstract principle of human\r\nconduct, but Gordon carried it to an excess that made it difficult not\r\nso much for his fellow-men to understand him, as for them to hold\r\nordinary workaday relations with him. This was due mainly to two\r\ncauses--a habitual shyness, and his own perception that he could not\r\nrestrain his tongue from uttering unpalatable and unconventional\r\ntruths. He was so unworldly and self-sacrificing in his own actions\r\nthat he could not let himself become even in a passive sense\r\nsubservient to the very worldly means by which all men more or less\r\nadvance in public and private life. The desire of Ministers and War\r\nOffice authorities to bring him forward, to eulogise his Chinese\r\nexploits, and in the end to give him worthy employment, was regarded\r\nby him as that secret favouritism that he abhorred. He retired into\r\nhis shell at every effort made to bring him into prominence. He tore\r\nup his diary sooner than that it should be the means of giving him\r\nnotoriety. He even refused special employment and promotion, because\r\nit would put him over the heads of his old comrades at the Woolwich\r\nAcademy. The inevitable result followed. Those in power came to regard\r\nhim as eccentric, and when occasions arose that would have provided\r\nhim with congenial and much-desired employment on active service for\r\nhis own country, his name was passed over, and the best soldier in\r\nEngland was left in inglorious and uncongenial inactivity. This was\r\nregrettable, but natural. The most heroic cannot pose as being too\r\nelevated above their fellows, or they will be left like Achilles\r\nsulking in his tent.\r\n\r\nThere were moments, we have been told, when in the bosom of the family\r\ncircle he threw off the reserve in which he habitually wrapped\r\nhimself, and narrated in stirring if simple language the course of his\r\ncampaigns in China. These outbursts were few and far between. They\r\nbecame still less frequent when he found that the effect of his\r\ndescription was to increase the admiration his relatives never\r\nconcealed from him. His mother, whose feelings towards him were of a\r\nspecially tender nature, and whose solicitude for his personal safety\r\nhad been more than once evinced, took the greatest pride in his\r\nachievements, and a special pleasure at their recital. But even her\r\nadmiration caused Charles Gordon as much pain as pleasure, and it is\r\nrecorded that while she was exhibiting to a circle of friends a map\r\ndrawn by him during his old term days at the Academy, he came into the\r\nroom, and seeing that it was being made a subject of admiration, took\r\nit from his mother, tore it in half, and threw it into the fire grate.\r\nSome little time after he repented of this act of rudeness, collected\r\nthe fragments, pasted them together, and begged his mother's\r\nforgiveness. This damaged plan or map is still in existence. His\r\nextraordinary diffidence and shrinking from all forms of praise or\r\nexaltation was thus revealed at a comparatively early stage of his\r\ncareer, and in connection with the first deeds that made him famous.\r\nThe incident just described shows that his way of asserting his\r\nindividuality was not always unattended with unkindness to those who\r\nwere nearest and dearest to him. His distrust of his own temper, and\r\nof his capacity to speak and act conventionally, urged him towards a\r\nsolitary life; and when his fate took him into places and forms of\r\nemployment where solitude was the essential condition of the service,\r\nit is not surprising that his natural shyness and humility, as well as\r\nthat habit of speaking his own mind, not only without fear or favour,\r\nbut also, it must be admitted, with considerable disregard for the\r\nfeelings of others, became intensified, and the most noticeable of his\r\nsuperficial characteristics.\r\n\r\nBut although Gordon was averse to praise and any special promotion, he\r\nwas most anxious to resume the work of his profession, in which he\r\ntook a peculiar pride, and for which he felt himself so thoroughly\r\nwell suited. His temperament was naturally energetic and impulsive.\r\nThe independent command he had exercised in China had strengthened\r\nthese tendencies, and made a dull routine doubly irksome to one whose\r\neager spirit sought action in any form that offered. The quiet\r\ndomestic life of the family circle at Southampton soon became\r\nintolerable to his restless spirit, and although he was entitled to\r\ntwo years' leave after his long foreign service, he took steps to\r\nreturn to active service as an engineer officer within a very few\r\nmonths of his return to England.\r\n\r\nOn 1st September 1865 he was appointed Commanding Royal Engineer\r\nofficer at Gravesend, to superintend the erection of the new forts to\r\nbe constructed in that locality for the defence of the Thames. For\r\nsuch a post his active military service, as well as his technical\r\ntraining, eminently suited him; and although there was little promise\r\nof excitement about it, the work was distinctly congenial, and offered\r\nhim a field for showing practical judgment and skill as an engineer.\r\nHe threw himself into his task with his characteristic energy and\r\nenthusiasm. But how far the latter was damped by his prompt discovery\r\nthat the whole project of the Thames defences was faulty and unsound\r\nit is impossible to say, but his attention to his work in all its\r\ndetails certainly showed no diminution or falling off. There were five\r\nforts in all to be constructed--three on the south or Kent side of the\r\nriver, viz., New Tavern, Shornmead, and Cliffe; and two, Coalhouse and\r\nTilbury, on the north or Essex side. An immense sum had been voted by\r\nParliament for their construction, and Gordon was as loud as an\r\nofficer dare be in his denunciation of this extravagant waste of money\r\nas soon as he discovered by personal examination that the three\r\nsouthern forts could be turned into islands, and severed from all\r\ncommunication by an enemy cutting the river bank at Cooling; and also\r\nthat the northern forts were not merely unprotected in the rear, like\r\nthose of the Chinese, but completely commanded from the Essex range of\r\nhills. Notwithstanding this important discovery, made at the very\r\nbeginning, the original scheme was prosecuted to the end, with\r\nenormous outlay and useless result, for an entirely new system of\r\nriver defences had to be formed and carried out at a later period.\r\nBut for these errors Gordon was in no sense responsible, and they\r\nwould not have been committed if his advice and representations had\r\nbeen heeded.\r\n\r\nMr Arthur Stannard, who was assistant to the manager of the firm which\r\nhad been intrusted with the contract for the building of these forts,\r\ngave in the _Nineteenth Century_ for April 1885 the best account we\r\npossess of the manner in which Colonel Gordon discharged his official\r\nduties at Gravesend.\r\n\r\nColonel Gordon's headquarters were at a quaint-looking, old-fashioned\r\nhouse with a good-sized garden, close to the site on which the New\r\nTavern fort was to be erected. He considered himself to be on official\r\nduty from eight o'clock in the morning until two o'clock in the\r\nafternoon; and during these six hours he not only worked himself\r\nwithout intermission, but expected all those under him to work in the\r\nsame untiring spirit. He was a severe and unsparing taskmaster, and\r\nallowed no shirking. No other officer could have got half the work out\r\nof his men that he did. He used to keep them up to the mark by\r\nexclaiming, whenever he saw them flag: \"Another five minutes gone, and\r\nthis not done yet, my men! We shall never have them again.\"\r\n\r\nAnother instance of his unflagging energy and extreme activity was\r\nfurnished in connection with the boat in which he had to visit the\r\ndifferent parts of the defences. A two-oared, slow-moving boat was\r\nprovided for the purpose, but Gordon soon grew tired of this slow\r\nmeans of locomotion, and he started a four-oared gig. He trained these\r\nmen according to his own ideas, and expected them to row with all\r\ntheir might and main, and to lose not a minute in casting off their\r\nboat on his arrival. So fond was he of rapid motion, or so impressed\r\nwith the value of time, that he would continue to urge them on,\r\nwhenever any signs of slackening appeared, with exclamations: \"A\r\nlittle faster, boys, a little faster!\" and Mr Stannard states that he\r\nhas seen the boatmen land after such a row as this in as limp a\r\ncondition as four strong men could be. All his own movements were\r\ncarried on at the run, and his activity was such that few younger and\r\ntaller men were able to keep up with him. I well recollect myself my\r\nfirst interview with General Gordon in 1881, when he roused me up by a\r\nsurprise morning visit at eight o'clock--I had not returned from a\r\nnewspaper office till four o'clock--and carried me off, walking in a\r\nlight, springy way which was half a run up to the top of Campden Hill,\r\nto interview the late Sir Harry Parkes.\r\n\r\nWhile many incidents and the general tenor of his conduct show the\r\nnatural gentleness of Gordon and his softness of heart, he was a\r\nstrict disciplinarian, and even a martinet in some of his ways. As has\r\nbeen said, he came on duty at eight every morning punctually, but he\r\nwould not allow himself to be intruded upon before that hour. Mr\r\nStannard tells one story that furnishes striking evidence to this\r\neffect. Early in the morning the men were brought to a standstill in\r\ntheir work until Colonel Gordon arrived to decide some doubtful or\r\ndisputed matter. It was noticed that his bedroom window was wide open,\r\nand the contractor's manager was induced to go up and knock at his\r\ndoor for instructions. Gordon opened his door a little way, and\r\nexclaimed in a testy and irritable tone, \"Presently, presently.\" He\r\nmade his regular appearance at eight o'clock, and no one ventured to\r\nagain disturb him before the regulation hour.\r\n\r\nWith regard to his meals he was most abstemious, and at the same time\r\nirregular. His brother describes an arrangement by which he was able\r\nto take, at all events, his midday meal, and at the same time to carry\r\non his official work, especially in the matter of receiving visitors.\r\nHe had a deep drawer in his table, in which the food was deposited.\r\nWhen anyone came to see him, the drawer was closed, and all signs of a\r\nmeal were concealed. At all periods of his career he was a small and\r\nfrugal eater, partly because he deprecated extravagance in living, and\r\npartly because he considered that the _angina pectoris_ from which he\r\nthought he suffered could be best coped with by abstention from a\r\nsumptuous or heavy diet. Some days he would almost starve himself, and\r\nthen in the night Nature would assert herself, and he would have to\r\ncome downstairs and take whatever he found in the larder. It is\r\nrecorded that on one occasion he sucked ten or a dozen raw eggs. But\r\nif he denied himself the luxuries and even the necessaries of a decent\r\ntable, he possessed the true spirit of hospitality, and never expected\r\nhis guests to follow any different practice than their own. For them\r\nhe was always at pains to provide dainty fare and good wine. Nor must\r\nundue stress be laid on the isolated cases cited of his indifference\r\nto his personal comfort. Gordon was always attentive to his dress and\r\nappearance, never forgetting that he was a gentleman and an English\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nWhile quartered at Gravesend he received a visit from Sir William\r\nGordon, who had just been appointed to the command of the troops in\r\nScotland. Sir William was no relation, only a member of the same great\r\nclan, and he had served with Gordon in the trenches of the Crimea. He\r\nhad a great admiration and affection for the younger officer, and\r\nbegged him to accept the post of his _aide-de-camp_ in the North. The\r\nidea was not a pleasant one to our Gordon, but his good-nature led him\r\nto yield to the pressing invitations of his friend; and after he had\r\ngiven his assent, he was ill with nervousness and regret at having\r\ntied himself down to an uncongenial post. In some way or other Sir\r\nWilliam heard of his distress, and promptly released him from his\r\npromise, only exacting from him the condition that he should pay him a\r\nvisit at his home in Scotland. Soon afterwards Sir William Gordon\r\nbecame seriously ill, and Charles Gordon hastened to the North, where\r\nhe remained some time employed in cheering up his friend, who was\r\nsuffering from hypochondria. Some time afterwards Sir William died\r\nunder sad circumstances. He had wished to benefit General Gordon by\r\nhis will, but the latter absolutely refused to have anything except a\r\nsilver tea service, which he had promised Sir William, while alive, to\r\naccept, because \"it would pay for his funeral,\" and save any one being\r\nput to expense over that inevitable ceremony. The fate of this tea\r\nservice, valued at L70, cannot be traced. It had disappeared long\r\nbefore Gordon's departure for Khartoum, and was probably sold for some\r\nbeneficent work.\r\n\r\nThe Sir William Gordon incident was not the only external affair that\r\ndistracted his attention from the monotonous routine work of building\r\nforts on a set, but faulty and mistaken, plan. Glad as he was of any\r\nwork, in preference to the dull existence of a prolonged holiday in\r\nthe domestic circle, Gravesend was not, after all, the ideal of active\r\nservice to a man who had found the excitement of warfare so very\r\ncongenial to his own temperament. When, in the course of 1867 it\r\nbecame evident that an expedition would have to be sent to Abyssinia\r\nto release the prisoners, and to bring the Negus Theodore to his\r\nsenses, Gordon solicited the Horse Guards to include him in any force\r\ndespatched with this object. There is no reason to think that his wish\r\nwould not have been complied with if the expedition had been fitted\r\nout from England, but it was very wisely decided that the task should\r\nbe entrusted to the Anglo-Indian Army. The late Lord Napier of\r\nMagdala, then Commander-in-Chief of the Bombay Army, was appointed to\r\nthe command. The officers of his staff, as well as the troops under\r\nhim, were all drawn from the Bombay Army, and although his connection\r\nby marriage, Sir Charles Staveley, held a command under Napier, and\r\nwould willingly have assisted towards the gratification of his wish,\r\nan exception in Gordon's case could not be made without that\r\nfavouritism which he most deprecated. Still, it was a great\r\ndisappointment to him, and he shut himself up for a whole day, and\r\nwould see no one.\r\n\r\nIf the six years at Gravesend, \"the most peaceful and happy of any\r\nportion of my life,\" as he truly said, had left no other trace than\r\nhis official work, of which the details must necessarily be meagre,\r\nthere would have been a great blank in his life, and the reader would\r\nnecessarily possess no clue to the marked change between the Gordon\r\nof China and the Gordon of the Soudan. Not that there was any loss of\r\npower or activity, but in the transition period philanthropy had come\r\nto occupy the foremost place in Gordon's brain, where formerly had\r\nreigned supreme professional zeal and a keen appreciation--I will not\r\nsay love--of warlike glory. His private life and work at Gravesend\r\nexplain and justify what was said of him at that time by one of his\r\nbrother officers: \"He is the nearest approach to Jesus Christ of any\r\nman who ever lived.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been written of him that his house at Gravesend bore more\r\nresemblance to the home of a missionary than the quarters of an\r\nEnglish officer. His efforts to improve and soften the hard lot of the\r\npoor in a place like Gravesend began in a small way, and developed\r\ngradually into an extensive system of beneficence, which was only\r\nlimited by his small resources and the leisure left him by official\r\nduty. At first he took into his house two or three boys who attracted\r\nhis attention in a more or less accidental manner. He taught them in\r\nthe evening, fed and clothed them, and in due course procured for them\r\nemployment, principally as sailors or in the colonies. For a naturally\r\nbad sailor, he was very fond of the sea; and perhaps in his heart of\r\nhearts he cherished the thought that he was performing a national work\r\nin directing promising recruits to the first line of our defence, and\r\nthe main prop of this Empire. Soon his few special pupils swelled into\r\na class, not all boarders, but of outsiders who came in to learn\r\ngeography and hear the Colonel explain the Bible; and not only that,\r\nbut to be told of stirring deeds beyond the sea by one who had himself\r\ncontributed to the making of history. We can well believe that before\r\nthis uncritical but appreciative audience, from whose favour he had\r\nnothing to hope, or, as he would say, to fear, Gordon threw off the\r\nrestraint and shyness habitual to him. It was very typical of the man\r\nthat, where others thought only of instructing the poor and the\r\nignorant, his chief wish was to amuse them and make them laugh.\r\n\r\nBy this simple means his class increased, and grew too large for his\r\nroom. Sooner than break it up or discourage new-comers, he consented\r\nto teach in the ragged schools, where he held evening classes almost\r\nevery night. Where he had clothed two or three boys, he now\r\ndistributed several hundred suits in the year; and it is said that his\r\npupils became so numerous that he had to buy pairs of boots by the\r\ngross. All this was done out of his pay. His personal expenses were\r\nreduced to the lowest point, so that the surplus might suffice to\r\ncarry on the good work. It very often left him nearly penniless until\r\nhis next pay became due--and this was not very surprising, as he could\r\nnever turn a deaf ear to any tale of distress, and often emptied his\r\npockets at the recital of any specially touching misfortune. When any\r\noutside subject of national suffering appealed to his heart or touched\r\nhis fancy, he would consequently have no means available of sending\r\nany help, and this was specially the case during the suffering of the\r\nLancashire operatives after the close of the American Civil War. On\r\nthat occasion he defaced the gold medal given him by the Chinese\r\nEmpresses, and sent it anonymously to the fund, which benefited from\r\nit to the extent of L10; but, as has been already stated, he made this\r\nsacrifice with the greatest pain and reluctance.\r\n\r\nGordon's love of children, and especially of boys, was quite\r\nremarkable. He could enter into their feelings far better than he\r\ncould into those of grown men, and the irritability which he could\r\nscarcely suppress even among his friends was never displayed towards\r\nthem. He was always at their service, anxious to amuse them, and to\r\nminister to their rather selfish whims. Some accidental remark led his\r\nclass to express a wish to visit the Zoo. Gordon at once seized the\r\nidea, and said they should do so. He made all the arrangements as\r\ncarefully as if he were organising a campaign. His duties prevented\r\nhis going himself, but he saw them off at the station, under the\r\ncharge of his assistant, and well provided with baskets of food for\r\ntheir dinner and refreshment on their journey. Of course he defrayed\r\nthe whole expense, and on their return he gave them a treat of tea and\r\nstrawberries. He also thought of their future, being most energetic in\r\nprocuring them employment, and anxious in watching their after-career.\r\n\r\nFor some reason that is not clear he called these boys his \"kings.\" He\r\nprobably used it in the sense that they were his lieutenants, and he\r\nborrowed his imagery from the \"Wangs,\" or kings of the Taeping ruler.\r\nI am told, however, that he really used the word in a spiritual sense,\r\ntestifying that these boys were as kings in the sight of God. He\r\nfollowed the course of the first voyage of those who went to sea,\r\nsticking pins in a map to show the whereabouts of their respective\r\nvessels. It is not astonishing that his pupils should have felt for\r\nhim a special admiration and affection. He not merely supplied all\r\ntheir wants, but he endeavoured to make them self-reliant, and to\r\nraise them above the sordid and narrow conditions of the life to which\r\nthey were either born or reduced by the improvidence or misfortune of\r\ntheir parents. Of course Gordon was often deceived, and his confidence\r\nand charity abused; but these cases were, after all, the smaller\r\nproportion of the great number that passed through his hands. He\r\nsometimes met with gross ingratitude, like that of the boy whom he\r\nfound starving, in rags, and ill with disease, and whom he restored to\r\nhealth, and perhaps to self-respect, and then sent back to his parents\r\nin Norfolk. But neither from him nor from them did he ever receive\r\nthe briefest line of acknowledgment. Such experiences would have\r\ndisheartened or deterred other philanthropists, but they failed to\r\nruffle Gordon's serenity, or to discourage him in his work.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the following incident is as characteristic as anything that\r\ntook place between Gordon and his \"kings.\" A boy whom he had twice\r\nfitted out for the world, but who always came to grief after a few\r\nmonths' trial, returned for a third time in the evening. Gordon met\r\nhim at the gate, a mass of rags, in a deplorable condition, and\r\ncovered with vermin. Gordon could not turn him away, neither could he\r\nadmit him into his house, where there were several boys being brought\r\nup for a respectable existence. After a moment's hesitation, he led\r\nhim in silence to the stable, where, after giving him some bread and a\r\nmug of milk, he told him to sleep on a heap of clean straw, and that\r\nhe would come for him at six in the morning. At that hour Gordon\r\nappeared with a piece of soap, some towels, and a fresh suit of\r\nclothes, and, ordering the boy to strip, gave him a thorough washing\r\nwith his own hands from head to foot at the horse-trough. It is to be\r\nregretted that there is no record of the after-fate of this young\r\nprodigal, although it would be pleasant to think that he was the\r\nunknown man who called at Sir Henry Gordon's house in 1885, after the\r\nnews of Gordon's death, and wished to contribute L25 towards a\r\nmemorial, because he was one of the youths saved by General Gordon, to\r\nwhom all his success and prosperity in life were due.\r\n\r\nBut it must not be supposed that Gordon's acts of benevolence were\r\nrestricted to boys. He was not less solicitous of the welfare of the\r\nsick and the aged. His garden was a rather pretty and shaded one. He\r\nhad a certain number of keys made for the entrance, and distributed\r\nthem among deserving persons, chiefly elderly. They were allowed to\r\nwalk about, in the evening especially, and see the flowers,\r\nvegetables, and fruit which Gordon's gardener carefully cultivated.\r\nGordon himself declared that he derived no special pleasure from the\r\nsight of flowers, for the simple reason that he preferred to look at\r\nthe human face; and the same reason is the only one I can find he ever\r\ngave for his somewhat remarkable reticence about dogs and other\r\ndomestic animals. It was said of him that he always had handy \"a bit\r\no' baccy for the old men, and a screw o' tea for the old women.\" He\r\nwould hurry off at a moment's notice to attend to a dying person or to\r\nread the Bible by a sick-bed. In the hospital or the workhouse he was\r\nas well known as the visiting chaplain, and often he was requested by\r\nthe parish clergyman to take his place in visiting the sick. His\r\nspecial invention for the benefit of his large number of clients was\r\na system of pensions, which varied from a shilling to as much as a\r\npound a week. Many of these payments he continued long after he left\r\nGravesend, and a few were even paid until the day of his death. It is\r\nnot surprising, in view of these facts, that Gordon remained a poor\r\nman, and generally had no money at all. As he wrote very truly of\r\nhimself to his assistant Mr Lilley, \"You and I will never learn wisdom\r\nin money matters.\"\r\n\r\nMany stories have been told of his tenderness of heart, and of his\r\nreluctance to see punishment inflicted, but perhaps the following is\r\nthe most typical. A woman called on him one day with a piteous tale.\r\nGordon went to his bedroom to get half a sovereign for her, and while\r\nhe was away she took a fancy to a brown overcoat, which she hastened\r\nto conceal under her skirt. Gordon returned, gave her the money, and\r\nshe left with a profusion of thanks. While on her road home the coat\r\nslipped down, and attracted the notice of a policeman, who demanded an\r\nexplanation. She said, \"I took it from the Colonel,\" and was marched\r\nback for him to identify his property, and charge her with the theft.\r\nWhen Gordon heard the story, he was far more distressed than the\r\nculprit, and refused to comply with the constable's repeated requests\r\nto charge her. At last a happy thought came to his relief. Turning to\r\nthe woman, he said, with a twinkle in his eye, \"You wanted it, I\r\nsuppose?\" \"Yes,\" replied the astonished woman. Then turning to the\r\nequally astonished policeman he said, \"There, there, take her away,\r\nand send her about her business.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the various economies he practised in order to indulge his\r\nphilanthropy was that of not keeping a horse, and he consequently took\r\na great deal of walking exercise. During his walks along the Kentish\r\nlanes and foot-paths he distributed tracts, and at every stile he\r\ncrossed he would leave one having such an exhortation as \"Take heed\r\nthat thou stumbleth not.\" Yet all this was done in an honest, and, as\r\nI believe, a secretly humorous spirit of a serious nature, for Gordon\r\nwas as opposed to cant and idle protestations as any man. There is a\r\nstrikingly characteristic story preserved somewhere of what he did\r\nwhen a hypocritical, canting humbug of a local religious secretary of\r\nsome Society Fund or other paid a visit to a house while he was\r\npresent. Gordon remained silent during the whole of the interview. But\r\nwhen he was gone, and Gordon was asked what he thought of him, he\r\nreplied by waving his hand and drawing it across his throat, which he\r\nexplained signified in China that his head ought to be cut off as a\r\nhumbugging impostor.\r\n\r\nAlthough buried, as it were, at Gravesend, Gordon could not be\r\naltogether forgotten. The authorities at the Horse Guards could not\r\ncomply with his request to be attached to the Abyssinian expedition,\r\nbut they were willing enough to do him what in official circles was\r\nthought to be a very good turn when they could. The English membership\r\nof the Danubian Commission became vacant, and it was remembered that\r\nin his early days Gordon had taken part in the delimitation\r\nnegotiations which had resulted in the formation of that body. The\r\npost carried with it the good pay of L2000 a year, as some\r\ncompensation for the social and sanitary drawbacks and disadvantages\r\nof life in that region, and it was offered to Gordon, who accepted it.\r\nIt cut short his philanthropical labours, but it drew him back into\r\nthat current of active work for which he was already pining. He\r\ntherefore accepted it, and having presented some of the Snake flags of\r\nthe old Taeping Wangs to the local school in which he had toiled as a\r\nsimple teacher, he left Gravesend quietly, and without any\r\nmanifestation that it had lost its principal resident. Having\r\nmentioned the Snake flags, it is proper to add that the principal of\r\nthese, including some of his own which were shot to ribbons, were left\r\nby General Gordon to his sister, the late Miss Gordon, who in her turn\r\npresented them, with the Yellow Jacket and its appendages, the chief\r\nmandarin dress, etc., to the Royal Engineers at Chatham. The Gravesend\r\nlife closed with a notice in the local journal, from which the\r\nfollowing extract may be made; but once a year the old flags that led\r\nthe advance or retreat of the Chinese rebels are brought out from\r\ntheir cases and flaunted before the Gravesend scholars as the memorial\r\nof a brave and unselfish leader and teacher.\r\n\r\nThe farewell article in the local paper read as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"Our readers, without exception, will learn with regret of the\r\n     departure of Lieut.-Colonel Gordon, R.E., C.B., from the town in\r\n     which he has resided for six years, gaining a name by the most\r\n     exquisite charity that will long be remembered. Nor will he be\r\n     less missed than remembered in the lowly walks of life, by the\r\n     bestowal of gifts, by attendance and administration on the sick\r\n     and dying, by the kindly giving of advice, by attendance at the\r\n     Ragged School, Workhouse, and Infirmary--in fact, by general and\r\n     continued beneficence to the poor, he has been so unwearied in\r\n     well-doing that his departure will be felt by many as a personal\r\n     calamity. There are those who even now are reaping the rewards of\r\n     his kindness. His charity was essentially charity, and had its\r\n     root in deep philanthropic feeling and goodness of heart,\r\n     shunning the light of publicity, but coming even as the rain in\r\n     the night-time, that in the morning is noted not, but only the\r\n     flowers bloom, and give a greater fragrance.... All will wish him\r\n     well in his new sphere, and we have less hesitation in penning\r\n     these lines from the fact that laudatory notice will confer but\r\n     little pleasure upon him who gave with the heart and cared not\r\n     for commendation.\"\r\n\r\nGordon left for Galatz on 1st October 1871. He had visited and\r\ndescribed it fourteen or fifteen years before, and he found little or\r\nno change there. The special task intrusted to the Commission of which\r\nhe was a member was to keep open by constant and vigilant dredging the\r\nmouth of the Sulina branch of the Danube. He discovered very soon that\r\nthe duties were light and monotonous, and in the depressing\r\natmosphere--social and political as well as climatic--of the Lower\r\nDanube, he pined more than ever for bracing work, and for some task\r\nabout which he could feel in earnest. The same conclusion seems to\r\nhave forced itself upon his mind at the beginning and at the end of\r\nhis stay at Galatz. In one of his first letters he exclaims: \"How I\r\nlike England when I am out of it! There is no place in the world like\r\nit!\" In another letter, written on the very day of his departure home,\r\nhe wrote: \"Tell S. to thank God that he was born an Englishman.\"\r\nGordon was always intensely patriotic. His patriotism partook of the\r\nsame deep and fervid character as his religion, and these and many\r\nother little messages in his private correspondence furnish striking\r\nevidence to the fact.\r\n\r\nThe mention of Galatz recalls an incident, showing how long was his\r\nmemory, and how much he clung to old friendships. During the\r\nCommune--that is to say, when he was still at Gravesend--the papers\r\nstated that a General Bisson had been killed at the Bridge of Neuilly\r\non 9th April 1871. He wrote to Marshal Macmahon to inquire if he was\r\nthe same officer as his old colleague on the Danube, and received, to\r\nhis regret, an affirmative answer. General Bisson and Gordon had kept\r\nup a correspondence, in which the former always signed himself Bisson,\r\nC.B., being very proud of that honour, which was conferred on him for\r\nthe Crimea. He was taken prisoner early in the Franco-Prussian war,\r\nand was shot by the Communists almost immediately on his return from\r\nthe Prussian prison. Gordon's stay at Galatz was varied by an\r\nagreeable trip in 1872 to the Crimea, where he was sent to inspect the\r\ncemeteries with Sir John Adye. They travelled in an English gunboat,\r\nwhich proved a comfortable sea-boat, and Gordon wrote, \"General Adye\r\nis a very agreeable companion.\" The cemeteries were found much\r\nneglected, and in a sad state of disrepair. The Russian officers were\r\npronounced civil, but nothing more. But Gordon saw clearly that,\r\nhaving torn up the Black Sea Treaty, they were ready to recover\r\nBessarabia, and to restore Sebastopol to the rank of a first-class\r\nnaval fortress. After the Crimean tour he came to England on leave.\r\nHis time was short, but he managed to pay a flying visit to\r\nGravesend. He also could not resist the temptation of attending the\r\nfuneral of the Emperor Napoleon in January 1873, and he expressed his\r\nopinion of that ill-starred ruler in his usual terse manner--\"a\r\nkind-hearted, unprincipled man.\" His youngest brother, to whom he was\r\nmuch attached, and who had shared in the Woolwich frolics, died about\r\nthis time, and his mother was seized with paralysis, and no longer\r\nrecognised him. He felt this change most acutely, for between him and\r\nhis mother there had been a peculiar attachment, and when he was at\r\nhome she would hardly ever let him out of her sight. He used to call\r\nhis home visits doing duty as his mother's _aide-de-camp_. When he\r\nleft England for Galatz she was unconscious, and passed away some\r\nmonths later while he was abroad.\r\n\r\nIt was while General Gordon was on the Danube that preparations were\r\nmade for the expedition against the Ashantees, and many persons\r\nsuggested General Gordon for the command. It would have been an\r\nexcellent occasion for intrusting him with an independent command in\r\nhis country's service; but Sir Garnet, now Lord, Wolseley had recently\r\ngained much credit by his conduct of the Red River Expedition, and was\r\nappointed to the command of this force. General Gordon was no doubt\r\ndisappointed at the result, but not so much as he had been in the case\r\nof Abyssinia, and loyalty to an old Crimean colleague tempered his own\r\nloss with satisfaction at another's success. Still, on public grounds,\r\nit must be pronounced unfortunate that the last occasion which was\r\noffered of employing for a national cause the services of a soldier\r\nwho added the fervour and modesty of Wolfe to the genius of Clive\r\nshould have been allowed to pass by unutilised.\r\n\r\nA casual meeting with Nubar Pasha at Constantinople, on his way back\r\nfrom the Crimea in 1872, was destined to exercise what may be styled a\r\ndetermining influence on the rest of Gordon's life. At that meeting\r\nNubar Pasha sounded him as to his willingness to take service under\r\nthe Khedive, and Gordon, attracted by the prospect of doing good work\r\non a larger sphere, expressed his own readiness to take up the task of\r\nestablishing authority, and suppressing slavery in the Soudan,\r\nprovided that the permission of his own Government were granted. He\r\nheard nothing more of the matter for twelve months, but at the end of\r\nSeptember 1873 he received a communication to the effect that the\r\nKhedive wished to appoint him to succeed Sir Samuel Baker, and that\r\nthe British Government were quite willing to grant him the necessary\r\npermission. In a letter of 8th November 1873 to the Adjutant-General\r\nhe said:--\r\n\r\n     \"I have written an account of what I know of the Khedive's having\r\n     asked me to take Baker's place. It came about from a\r\n     conversation I had with Nubar Pasha at our Embassy at\r\n     Constantinople. This was twelve months ago. The next thing was a\r\n     telegram a month ago. I have not determined what to do, but the\r\n     Government have no objection.\"\r\n\r\nHe was not long, however, in making up his mind, and early in 1874 he\r\nwas _en route_ for Alexandria. One characteristic act in connection\r\nwith his appointment deserves mention. The Khedive fixed his salary at\r\nL10,000 a year, but Gordon absolutely refused to accept more than\r\nL2000 a year--the same sum as he received for his post on the Danube.\r\nVarious reasons have been given for this decision, but there is no\r\nground for supposing that it was due to such a very narrow-minded\r\nprejudice as \"that he would take nothing from a heathen.\" If he ever\r\nused these words, they must have been intended as a joke, and are not\r\nto be accepted seriously. A sufficient explanation of his decision is,\r\nthat he had a supreme disdain for money, and the sum offered seemed\r\nfar in excess of the post and work he had to perform. To have received\r\nL10,000 a year would have added immensely to his worries. He would not\r\nhave known what to do with it, and the voluntary cutting of his salary\r\nrelieved him of a weight of responsibility. Perhaps also he was\r\nfar-seeing enough to realise that he would be less the mere creature\r\nof the Egyptian ruler with the smaller than with the larger salary,\r\nwhile he could gratify his own inner pride that no one should say that\r\nany sordid motive had a part in his working for semi-civilized\r\npotentates, whether Chinese or Mussulmen.\r\n\r\nI am able to describe Gordon's exact feelings on this point in his own\r\nwords. \"My object is to show the Khedive and his people that gold and\r\nsilver idols are not worshipped by all the world. They are very\r\npowerful gods, but not so powerful as _our_ God. From whom does all\r\nthis money come? from poor miserable creatures who are ground down to\r\nproduce it. Of course these ideas are outrageous. Pillage the\r\nEgyptians is still the cry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST NILE MISSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nA brief description of the conquest by Mehemet Ali and his successors\r\nof the Soudan--a name signifying nothing more than \"the land of the\r\nblacks\"--and of the events which immediately preceded the appointment\r\nof Gordon, is necessary to show the extent of the work intrusted to\r\nhim, and the special difficulties with which he had to contend.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1819 that the great Pasha or Viceroy Mehemet Ali, still in\r\nname the lieutenant of the Sultan, ordered his sons Ismail and the\r\nmore famous Ibrahim to extend his authority up the Nile, and conquer\r\nthe Soudan. They do not seem to have experienced any difficulty in\r\ncarrying out their instructions. Nobody was interested in defending\r\nthe arid wastes of that region. The Egyptian yoke promised to be as\r\nlight as any other, and a few whiffs of grape-shot dispersed the only\r\nadversaries who showed themselves. Ibrahim, who soon took the lead,\r\nselected Khartoum as the capital of the new province, in preference to\r\nShendy, which had formerly been regarded as the principal place in the\r\ncountry. In this he showed excellent judgment, for Khartoum occupies\r\nan admirable position in the fork of the two branches of the Nile; and\r\nwhatever fate may yet befall the region in which the Mahdi and his\r\nsuccessor the Khalifa have set up their ephemeral authority, it is\r\ndestined by Nature to be the central point and capital of the vast\r\nregion between the Delta and the Equatorial Lakes.\r\n\r\nKhartoum lies on the left bank of the Blue Nile--Bahr-el-Azrak--rather\r\nmore than three miles south of its confluence with the White\r\nNile--Bahr-el-Abiad--at the northern point of the Isle of Tuti. The\r\nchannel south of that island affords a slightly nearer approach to the\r\nWhite Nile, coming out immediately opposite the fortified camp of\r\nOmdurman, which the Mahdi made his headquarters and capital after the\r\nfamous siege of 1884. There was nothing attractive or imposing about\r\nKhartoum. It contained 3000 mud houses, and one more pretentious\r\nbuilding in the Governor's official residence or palace, known as the\r\nHukumdariaha. It is surrounded by a wall and ditch, except where the\r\nBlue Nile supplies the need; and its western wall is not more than\r\nhalf a mile from the banks of the White Nile, so that with proper\r\nartillery it commands both rivers. The Nilometer at this place used to\r\ngive the first and early intimation to the cultivators in Lower Egypt\r\nof the quantity of water being brought down from the rivers of\r\nAbyssinia. There seems no other conclusion possible than that sooner\r\nor later this practical service will compel Egypt, whenever she feels\r\nstrong enough, to re-establish her power at Khartoum; already there is\r\nevidence that the time has arrived.\r\n\r\nHaving conquered the Soudan easily, the rulers of Egypt experienced no\r\ndifficulty in retaining it for sixty years; and if other forces,\r\npartly created by the moral pressure of England and civilized opinion\r\ngenerally, had not come into action, there is every reason to suppose\r\nthat their authority would never have been assailed. Nor did the\r\nEgyptians stand still. By the year 1853 they had conquered Darfur on\r\nthe one side, and pushed their outposts on the other 120 miles south\r\nof Khartoum. In the rear of the Egyptian garrison came the European\r\ntrader, who took into his service bands of Arab mercenaries, so that\r\nhe pushed his way beyond the Egyptian stations into the region of the\r\nBahr Gazelle, where the writ of the Cairo ruler did not run. These\r\ntraders came to deal in ivory, but they soon found that, profitable as\r\nit was, there was a greater profit in, and a far greater supply of,\r\n\"black ivory.\" Thus an iniquitous trade in human beings sprang up, and\r\nthe real originators of it were not black men and Mahommedans, but\r\nwhite men, and in many instances Englishmen. From slave buying they\r\ntook to slave hunting, and in this way there is no exaggeration in\r\ndeclaring that villages and districts were depopulated. Such\r\nscandalous proceedings could not be carried on in the dark, and at\r\nlast the Europeans involved felt compelled, by the weight of adverse\r\nopinion, or more probably from a sense of their own peril, to withdraw\r\nfrom the business. This touch of conscience or alarm did not improve\r\nthe situation. They sold their stations to their Arab agents, who in\r\nturn purchased immunity from the Egyptian officers. The slave trade,\r\nby the pursuit and capture of any tribe rash enough to come within the\r\nspring of the Arab raiders, flourished as much as ever. The only\r\nchange was that after 1860 Europeans were clear of the stigma that\r\nattached to any direct participation in it.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Soudan during this period has been graphically\r\ndescribed by Captain Speke, Dr Schweinfurth, and Sir Samuel Baker.\r\nThey all agree in their facts and their conclusions. The people were\r\nmiserably unhappy, because the dread and the reality of compulsory\r\nslavery hung over their daily life. Those who were not already slaves\r\nrealised their impending fate. Villages were abandoned, districts\r\npassed out of cultivation, and a large part of the population\r\nliterally vanished. Sir Samuel Baker, speaking of the difference\r\nbetween a region he knew well in 1864 and in 1872, wrote in the latter\r\nyear: \"It is impossible to describe the change that has taken place\r\nsince I last visited this country. It was then a perfect garden,\r\nthickly populated, and producing all that man could desire. The\r\nvillages were numerous, groves of plantains fringed the steep cliffs\r\non the river's bank, and the natives were neatly dressed in the bark\r\ncloth of the country. The scene has changed! All is wilderness. The\r\npopulation has fled! Not a village is to be seen! This is the certain\r\nresult of the settlement of Khartoum traders. They kidnap the women\r\nand children for slaves, and plunder and destroy wherever they set\r\ntheir foot.\" How true all this was will be seen in the course of\r\nGordon's own experiences.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that the Arab slave-dealers made terms with the\r\nEgyptian officials, and they were even not without influence and the\r\nmeans of gaining favourable consideration at Cairo itself. But as they\r\nincreased in numbers, wealth, and confidence in themselves and their\r\norganisation, the Khedive began to see in them a possible danger to\r\nhis own authority. This feeling was strengthened when the slavers,\r\nunder the leadership of the since notorious Zebehr Rahama, the most\r\nambitious and capable of them all, refused to pay their usual tribute.\r\nDr Schweinfurth has given a vivid picture of this man in the heyday of\r\nhis power. Chained lions formed part of his escort, and it is recorded\r\nthat he had 25,000 dollars' worth of silver cast into bullets in order\r\nto foil the magic of any enemy who was said to be proof against lead.\r\nStrong as this truculent leader was in men and money, the Khedive\r\nIsmail did not believe that he would dare to resist his power. He\r\ntherefore decided to have recourse to force, and in 1869 he sent a\r\nsmall military expedition, under the command of Bellal Bey, to bring\r\nthe Bahr Gazelle into submission. Zebehr had made all his arrangements\r\nfor defence, and on the Egyptian army making its appearance he\r\npromptly attacked and annihilated it. This success fully established\r\nthe power and reputation of Zebehr, who became the real dictator of\r\nthe Soudan south of Khartoum. The Khedive, having no available means\r\nof bringing his rebellious dependent to reason, had to acquiesce in\r\nthe defeat of his army. Zebehr offered some lame excuse for his\r\nboldness and success, and Ismail had to accept it, and bide the hour\r\nof revenge.\r\n\r\nZebehr, encouraged by this military triumph, turned his arms against\r\nthe Sultans of Darfour, who had incurred his resentment by placing an\r\nembargo on wheat during the course of his brief campaign with Bellal.\r\nThis offensive action still further alarmed the Khedive Ismail, who\r\nwas fully alive to the danger that might arise to his own position if\r\na powerful military confederacy, under a capable chief, were ever\r\norganised in the Soudan. Instead of allying himself with the\r\nDarfourians, as would probably have been the more politic course,\r\nIsmail decided to invade their territory simultaneously with Zebehr.\r\nSeveral battles were fought, and one after another the Sultans of\r\nDarfour, whose dynasty had reigned for 400 years, were overthrown and\r\nslain. Zebehr received in succession the Turkish titles of Bey and\r\nPasha, but he was not satisfied, for he said that as he had done all\r\nthe fighting, he ought to receive the Governor-Generalship of Darfour.\r\nIf he failed to win that title from the Khedive, he succeeded in\r\ngratifying a more profitable desire, by leading off into slavery the\r\nlarger half of the population of Darfour. He was still engaged in this\r\npursuit at the time of Gordon's appearance on the scene, and the force\r\nat his disposal was thus described by that officer: \"Smart,\r\ndapper-looking fellows, like antelopes, fierce, unsparing, the terror\r\nof Central Africa, having a prestige far beyond that of the\r\nGovernment--these are the slave-dealers' tools,\" and afterwards they\r\nno doubt became the main phalanx of the Mahdi's military system.\r\n\r\nThe financial position of the Egyptian Government in the Soudan was as\r\nbad as the military and political. The Khedive's Governor-General at\r\nKhartoum, Ismail Yakoob Pasha, was nominally responsible for the\r\nadministration of Darfour, although Zebehr reaped all the gain. This\r\narrangement resulted in a drain on the Khedive's exchequer of L50,000\r\na year. The revenue failed to meet the expenditure in the other\r\ndepartments, and this was mainly due to the fact that the slavers no\r\nlonger paid toll or tithe in the only trade that they had allowed to\r\nexist in the Soudan. What share of the human traffic they parted with\r\nwas given in the way of bribes, and found no place in the official\r\nreturns. All the time that this drain continued the Khedive was in a\r\nconstant state of apprehension as to the danger which might arise to\r\nhim in the south. He was also in receipt of frequent remonstrances\r\nfrom the English and other Governments as to the iniquities of the\r\nslave-trade, for which he was primarily in no sense to blame. On the\r\nother hand, he derived no benefit from the Soudan; and if he thought\r\nhe could have obtained a secure frontier at Abou Hamid, or even at\r\nWadi Halfa, he would have resigned all the rest without a sigh. But it\r\nwas his strong conviction that no such frontier was attainable, and\r\nIsmail clung to his nominal and costly authority over the Soudan in\r\nthe hope that some improvement might be effected, or that, in the\r\nchapter of accidents, the unexpected might come to his aid.\r\n\r\nAlarmed as to his own position, in view of the ambition of Zebehr, and\r\nharassed by the importunities of England, Ismail, acting on the\r\nadvice of his able and dexterous Minister, Nubar Pasha, one of the\r\nmost skilful diplomatists the East has ever produced, came to the\r\ndecision to relieve himself from at least the latter annoyance, by the\r\nappointment of Gordon. This was the main object the Khedive and his\r\nadvisers had in view when they invited Gordon to accept the post of\r\nGovernor of the Equatorial Provinces in succession to Sir Samuel\r\nBaker, who resigned what he found after many years' experience was a\r\nhopeless and thankless task. The post was in one sense peculiar. It\r\nwas quite distinct from that of the Egyptian Governor-General at\r\nKhartoum, who retained his separate and really superior position in\r\nthe administration of the Upper Nile region. Moreover, the finances of\r\nthe Equatorial districts were included in the general Soudan Budget,\r\nwhich always showed an alarming deficit. These arrangements imparted a\r\nspecial difficulty into the situation with which Gordon had to deal,\r\nand his manner of coping with it will reveal how shrewd he was in\r\ndetecting the root-cause of any trouble, and how prompt were his\r\nmeasures to eradicate the mischief. From the first he fully realised\r\nwhy he was appointed, viz. \"to catch the attention of the English\r\npeople\"; but he also appreciated the Khedive's \"terrible anxiety to\r\nput down the slave-trade, which threatens his supremacy.\" With these\r\nintroductory remarks, the main thread of Gordon's career may be\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\nAfter the brief hesitation referred to in the last chapter, and the\r\nreduction of his salary to what he deemed reasonable dimensions,\r\nGordon proceeded to Cairo, where he arrived early in the year 1874. As\r\nin everything else he undertook, Gordon was in earnest about the work\r\nhe had to attempt, and no doubt he had already formed in his mind a\r\ngeneral plan of action, which would enable him to suppress the\r\nslave-trade. Here it will suffice to say that his project was based on\r\nthe holding of the White Nile by a line of fortified posts, and with\r\nthe river steamers, which would result in cutting off the slave\r\nhunters from their best source of supply. The expression of his plans\r\nin his earnest manner showed up by contrast the hollowness of the\r\nviews and policy of those who had obtained his services. In his own\r\ngraphic and emphatic way he wrote: \"I thought the thing real and found\r\nit a sham, and felt like a Gordon who has been humbugged.\" He found\r\nCairo \"a regular hot-bed of intrigues,\" and among not only the\r\nEgyptian, but also the European officials. With a prophetic grasp of\r\nthe situation he wrote, \"Things cannot last long like this.\" Had\r\nGordon been long detained at Cairo, where the etiquette and the advice\r\noffered him by every one in an official position exasperated him\r\nbeyond endurance, there is no doubt that he would have thrown up his\r\ntask in disgust. He was animated by the desire to make the sham a\r\nreality, and to convert the project with which he had been intrusted\r\ninto a beneficial scheme for the suffering population of the Soudan.\r\nThere, at least, he would be removed from the intrigues of the\r\ncapital, and at liberty to speak his own thoughts without giving\r\numbrage to one person and receiving worldly counsel from another.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief bones of contention during the few weeks he passed at\r\nCairo was the dispute as to how he should travel to the scene of his\r\ngovernment. He wished to go by ordinary steamer, with one servant. The\r\nMinister insisted that he should travel by a special steamer, and\r\naccompanied by a retinue. Gordon's plan would have saved the Khedive's\r\nGovernment L400, but he had to give way to the proprieties. The affair\r\nhad an amusing issue. His special train to Suez met with an accident,\r\nand he and the Egyptian officials sent to see him off were compelled,\r\nafter two hours' delay, to change into another train, and continue\r\ntheir journey in an ordinary passenger carriage, much to the amusement\r\nof Gordon, who wrote: \"We began in glory and ended in shame!\" On\r\narrival at Souakim, Gordon was put into quarantine for a night, in\r\norder, as he said, that the Governor might have time to put on his\r\nofficial clothes.\r\n\r\nSoon his attention was drawn from such frivolities as these to more\r\nserious matters. He left Cairo on 21st February, reached Souakim on\r\n26th, left Souakim on 1st March, Berber on 9th March, and entered\r\nKhartoum 13th March. He brought with him 200 fresh troops, and was\r\nwelcomed with considerable display and many hollow protestations of\r\nfriendship by the Governor-General, Ismail Yakoob.\r\n\r\nA few weeks before his arrival at Khartoum an important event had\r\ntaken place, which greatly simplified his ulterior operations. The\r\n\"sudd,\" an accumulation of mould and aquatic plants which had formed\r\ninto a solid mass and obstructed all navigation, had suddenly given\r\nway, and restored communication with Gondokoro and the lakes. The\r\nimportance of this event may be measured by the fact that whereas the\r\njourney to Gondokoro, with the \"sudd\" in existence, took twenty months\r\nand even two years to perform, it was reduced by its dispersal to\r\ntwenty-one days. General Gordon wrote the following very pretty\r\ndescription of this grassy barrier and its origin:\r\n\r\n     \"A curious little cabbage-like aquatic plant comes floating down,\r\n     having a little root ready to attach itself to anything; he meets\r\n     a friend, and they go together, and soon join roots and so on.\r\n     When they get to a lake, the current is too strong, and so, no\r\n     longer constrained to move on, they go off to the sides; others\r\n     do the same--idle and loitering, like everything up here. After a\r\n     time winds drive a whole fleet of them against the narrow outlet\r\n     of the lake and stop it up. Then no more passenger plants can\r\n     pass through the outlet, while plenty come in at the upper end of\r\n     the lake; these eventually fill up all the passages which may\r\n     have been made.\"\r\n\r\nGordon had the control of seven steamers, and in one of these he left\r\nKhartoum on 22nd March for the Upper Nile. He had already issued his\r\nfirst decree as Governor of the Equator, in which he declared the sale\r\nof ivory to be a Government monopoly, and forbade the importation of\r\nfirearms and ammunition. It was while he was on this journey that he\r\nheard some birds--a kind of stork--laughing on the banks of the river.\r\nIn his letters to his sister, which were to stand in the place of a\r\ndiary, he facetiously remarks that he supposes they were amused at the\r\nidea of anyone being so foolish as to go up the Nile in \"the hope of\r\ndoing anything.\" But Gordon was not to be discouraged. Already he\r\nliked his work, amid the heat and mosquitoes day and night all the\r\nyear round, and already he was convinced that he could do a good deal\r\nto ameliorate the lot of the unfortunate people. He reached Gondokoro\r\non 16th April, where not only was he not expected, but he found them\r\nignorant even of his appointment. He remained there only a few days,\r\nas he perceived he could do nothing without his stores, still _en\r\nroute_ from Cairo, and returned to Khartoum, which he reached in\r\neleven days.\r\n\r\nThis brief trip satisfied him of several simple facts bearing on the\r\nsituation in the Equatorial Province which the Khedive had sent him\r\nwith such a flourish of trumpets to govern. He found very easily that\r\nthe Egyptian Government possessed no practical authority in that\r\nregion. Beyond the two forts at Gondokoro--garrison 300 men--and\r\nFatiko--garrison 200 men--the Khedive had no possessions, and there\r\nwas not even safety for his representatives half a mile from\r\ntheir guns. As Gordon said: \"The Khedive gave me a Firman as\r\nGovernor-General of the Equator, and left me to work out the rest.\" He\r\nbegan the practical part of his task on the occasion of this return to\r\nKhartoum by insisting that the accounts of the Equatorial Province\r\nshould be kept distinct from those of the Soudan, and also that Ragouf\r\nPasha, sent nominally to assist but really to hinder him, should be\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nHaving asserted his individuality after several rows with Ismail\r\nYakoob, he became impatient at the delayed arrival of his stores and\r\nstaff, and hastened off to Berber to hurry their progress. As he was\r\nfond of saying, \"Self is the best officer,\" and his visit to Berber\r\nhastened the arrival of the supplies which were necessary for his\r\nsubsequent operations. His staff consisted of Colonel Long, of the\r\nUnited States Army, who had accompanied him to Gondokoro and been left\r\nthere; Major Campbell, Egyptian Staff; Mr Kemp, an engineer; M.\r\nLinant, a Frenchman; Mr Anson, Mr Russell, and the Italian Romulus\r\nGessi. Two Royal Engineer officers, Lieutenants Chippendall and\r\nCharles Watson, joined him before the end of the year. He worked very\r\nhard himself, and he expected those under him to do the same. The\r\nastonished Egyptian officials looked on in amazement at one in high\r\nrank, who examined into every detail himself, and who took his turn of\r\nthe hard work. One of Gordon's forms of recreation was to get out and\r\nhelp to pull his _dahabeah_. Tucking up his trousers, he would wade\r\nthrough the river fearlessly, having learnt from the natives that\r\ncrocodiles never attack a person moving.\r\n\r\nAt first Ismail Yakoob and his colleagues were filled with curiosity\r\nand amusement at this phenomenal Englishman--so different, not merely\r\nfrom themselves, but from other Europeans--then apprehension seized\r\nthem as to what he would do next in the way of exposing their neglect\r\nof duty, and finally only the capacity for one sentiment was\r\nleft--relief whenever he turned his back on Khartoum.\r\n\r\nHaving collected his staff and supplies, he started up the Nile once\r\nmore, to begin the establishment of the line of fortified posts, which\r\nhe had resolved on as the best means of maintaining and extending his\r\nown authority, and at the same time of curtailing the raids of the\r\nslave-dealers. The first of these forts or stations he established at\r\nthe entrance of the Saubat river, and while there he made a discovery\r\nwhich showed how the slave-trade flourished with such impunity. He\r\nseized some letters from a slave-dealer to the Egyptian commander at\r\nFashoda, stating that he was bringing him the slaves he wanted for\r\nhimself and many others, besides 2000 cows. By several skilful\r\nmanoeuvres Gordon succeeded in rescuing all of them, restoring the\r\ncows to their owners, and compelling the soldiers of the slavehunters\r\nto return to their homes, generally in or near Khartoum. Nor was this\r\nhis only success during the first two months of his government, for he\r\ndetected one of his lieutenants in the act of letting a slave convoy\r\npass in return for a bribe of L70. On this occasion he had the\r\nsatisfaction of delivering 1600 human beings from slavery. This will\r\nshow that one of his principal difficulties was caused by his own\r\nsubordinates, who were hand-in-glove with the leading slavehunters.\r\nAnother of Gordon's troubles arose from the collapse of his staff\r\nunder the terrible heat. Of those enumerated as having gone up with or\r\nto him in May, all were dead or invalided in September; and the duties\r\nof sick-nurse at last became so excessive that Gordon had to order, in\r\nhis own quaint manner, that no one who was sick should be allowed to\r\ncome to headquarters. Only in this way was he able to obtain the time\r\nnecessary for the accomplishment, single handed, of his various\r\nduties. Such was the strain on him that he gave positive injunctions\r\nthat no more Europeans, and especially young English officers, were to\r\nbe sent up to him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was realised that the new Governor was in earnest, that\r\nhe was bent on crushing the slave-trade, and that he would not permit\r\ncorruption or extortion in any form, he became the mark of general\r\nhostility. The intrigues to mislead and discredit him were incessant.\r\nAbou Saoud, who had been formerly banished by Sir Samuel Baker from\r\nthe Soudan, and then taken into high favour by Gordon, turned out a\r\nfraud and a failure, while Raouf Bey, the nominee of the Khartoum\r\nGovernor-General, was sent back in disgrace. With regard to Abou Saoud\r\nit may be said that Gordon never really trusted him, that is to say he\r\nwas not taken in by him, but believed he would be less able to do\r\ninjury in his service than at a distance. It was precisely the same\r\nprinciple as led him to solicit the co-operation of Zebehr in 1884.\r\n\r\nGordon's method of dealing with those who caused him trouble was short\r\nand simple. It consisted in a brief but unchallengeable order to go\r\nback to the base. As the officials would have been murdered by the\r\npeople they had so long and so often injured if they attempted to seek\r\nshelter among them, they had no alternative save to obey; and thus,\r\none after another, Gordon brushed the chief obstructionists from his\r\npath. He served the old troublesome soldiers who would not work or\r\nchange their ways after the same fashion, by sending them to his\r\nBotany Bay at Khartoum. In the midst of all these troubles he kept\r\nwell, although \"a mere shadow,\" and he still retained the conviction\r\nthat he would be able to do much good work in this unpromising region.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the natives, he endeavoured first to induce them to\r\ncultivate the ground, providing them with seed and dhoora (_sorghum_),\r\nand then to accustom them to the use of money. He bought their ivory\r\nand paid for it in coin, so that in a little time he found that the\r\ninhabitants, who had held aloof from all previous Egyptian officials,\r\nfreely brought him their ivory and produce for sale. At the same time,\r\nhe made it a point to pay scrupulously for any service the natives\r\nrendered, and he even endeavoured, as far as he could, to put\r\nemployment in their way. The practice of the Egyptian officials had\r\nbeen to lay hands on any natives that came across their path, and\r\ncompel them by force to perform any work they might deem necessary,\r\nand then to dismiss them without reward or thanks. The result was a\r\ndeep-rooted execration of the whole Egyptian system, which found voice\r\nin the most popular war-cry of the region: \"We want no Turks here! Let\r\nus drive them away!\" But Gordon's mode was widely different. It was\r\nbased on justice and reason, and in the long-run constituted sound\r\npolicy. He paid for what he took, and when he used the natives to drag\r\nhis boats, or to clear tracks through the grassy zone fringing the\r\nNile, he always carefully handed over to them cows, dhoora, or money,\r\nas an equivalent for their work. On the other hand, he was not less\r\nprompt to punish hostile tribes by imposing taxes on them, and, when\r\nunavoidable, inflicting punishment as well. But the system averted, as\r\nfar as possible, the necessity of extreme measures, and in this the\r\nfirst period of his rule in the Soudan he had few hostile collisions\r\nwith the natives of the country. Indeed, with the exception of the\r\nBari tribe, who entrapped Linant, Gordon's best lieutenant after\r\nGessi, and slew him with a small detachment, Gordon's enemies in the\r\nfield proved few and insignificant. Even the Baris would not have\r\nventured to attack him but for the acquaintance with, and contempt of,\r\nfirearms they had obtained during an earlier success over an Egyptian\r\ncorps.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that this absence of any organised opposition was\r\nfortunate, for the so-called troops at the disposal of the Governor of\r\nthe Equator were as miserably inefficient and contemptible, from a\r\nfighting point of view, as any General Gordon ever commanded; and at a\r\nlater stage of his career he plaintively remarked that it had fallen\r\nto his lot to lead a greater number of cowardly and unwarlike races\r\nthan anyone else. But it was not merely that they were such poor\r\nfighters that Gordon declared that three natives would put a company\r\nto flight, but they were so disinclined for any work, and so\r\nencumbered by their women and children, that their ability to make any\r\nmilitary show might be as safely challenged as their combative spirit.\r\nWell might Gordon write: \"I never had less confidence in any troops in\r\nmy life.\" But even these shortcomings were not the worst. The Arab\r\nsoldiers provided by the Egyptian Government, and sent up over and\r\nover again, in spite of Gordon's protests and entreaties, could not\r\nstand the climate. They died like flies. Of one detachment of 250,\r\nhalf were dead in three months, 100 of the others were invalided, and\r\nonly 25 remained fit for duty. From a further body of 150 men sent as\r\na reinforcement, half were reported on the sick list the day after\r\ntheir arrival. The main buttress of the Khedive's authority in this\r\nregion was therefore hollow and erected on an insecure foundation. The\r\nEgyptian soldiers possessed firearms, and the natives, in their\r\nignorance that they could not shoot straight, were afraid of them; but\r\nthe natural progress of knowledge would inevitably prove fatal to that\r\nunreal supremacy, and eventually entail the collapse of the Cairo\r\nadministration in the Soudan and the remoter districts on the\r\nEquator.\r\n\r\nRealising the inefficiency of the Egyptian force, General Gordon set\r\nhimself to the task of providing a better; and mindful of the\r\ncontingent danger of creating a corps that might in the end prove a\r\nperil to the system it was meant to protect, he resolved that, if\r\nindividually brave and efficient, it should be exceedingly limited in\r\nnumbers, and incapable of casting aside its allegiance to the Khedive.\r\nHe began in a small way by engaging the services of any stalwart\r\nSoudanese native whom chance placed in his path, and thus he organised\r\nin the first year of his rule a corps of about forty men as a sort of\r\nbodyguard. An accident brought him into contact with a party of the\r\nNiam Niam, a tribe of cannibals from the interior of Africa, but\r\npossessing a martial spirit and athletic frames. Gordon looked at them\r\nwith the eye of a soldier, and on the spot enrolled fifty of them into\r\nthe small force he was organising. He armed them with spears as well\r\nas guns, and as these spears were cutting ones, with a blade two feet\r\nlong, they were the more formidable weapon of the two. Gordon\r\ndescribes the Niam Niam warriors as looking very fierce, and brave,\r\nand fearless. They were also thick-set and sturdy, and, above all, so\r\nindifferent to the tropical heat that they might be relied on not to\r\nbreak down from the climate like the Egyptian soldiers. Before the end\r\nof the year 1876 he had increased the numbers of these two contingents\r\nto 500 men. It was with these black troops that Gordon humbled the\r\npride of the Baris, elated by their two successes, and provided for\r\nthe security of the long Nile route to the lakes.\r\n\r\nThere was another advantage besides the military in this practical\r\nmeasure, one of those numerous administrative acts, in every clime and\r\nunder innumerable conditions, that established the fame and the sound\r\nsense and judgment of General Gordon. It promoted economy, and\r\ncontributed to the sound finance which Gordon always set himself to\r\nestablish wherever he was responsible. One of Gordon's first\r\nresolutions had been that his part of the Soudan should cease to be a\r\ndrain, like the rest, on the Cairo Exchequer. He determined that he at\r\nleast would pay his way, and on the threshold of his undertaking he\r\nhad insisted, and carried in the teeth of powerful opposition his\r\nresolution, that the accounts of the Equatorial Province should be\r\nkept distinct from those of the Soudan. The employment of black\r\nsoldiers was very economical as well as efficient, and contributed to\r\nthe satisfactory result which was shown in the balance-sheet of the\r\nEquatorial Province as described by General Gordon for the year 1875.\r\nIn that year the Khedive received L48,000 from the Province which\r\nGordon ruled at a total cost of only L20,000, while he had also formed\r\na surplus or reserve fund of L60,000 more.\r\n\r\nHaving thus accomplished as much as possible towards the\r\nstrengthening of the administration and tranquillisation of the\r\npeople, some further particulars may be recorded of his measures and\r\nsuccess in dealing with that slave-trade, the existence of which was\r\nthe primary cause of his own appearance in the Soudan. Allusion has\r\nalready been made to the considerable number of slaves rescued by a\r\nfew grand _coups_ at the expense of his own subordinates, but during\r\nthe whole of these three years Gordon was in close contact with\r\nslaves, and the rescue of individuals was of frequent occurrence.\r\nSeveral touching incidents are recorded in the letters published from\r\nCentral Africa as to his kindness towards women and infants, to some\r\nof whom he even gave the shelter of his own tent; and nothing could be\r\nmore effective in the way of illustration than his simple description\r\nof the following passage with the child-wife of one of his own\r\nsoldiers:\r\n\r\n     \"The night before I left this place a girl of twelve years, in\r\n     one of those leather strap girdles, came up to the fire where I\r\n     was sitting, and warmed herself. I sent for the interpreter, and\r\n     asked what she wanted. She said the soldier who owned her beat\r\n     her, and she would not stay with him; so I put her on board the\r\n     steamer. The soldier was very angry, so I said: 'If the girl\r\n     likes to stay with you, she may; if she does not, she is free.'\r\n     The girl would not go back, so she stays on the steamer.\"\r\n\r\nNor was this the only incident of the kind to show not merely the\r\ntenderness of his heart, but the extraordinary reputation Gordon had\r\nacquired by his high-minded action among these primitive and\r\ndown-trodden races. Here are some others that have been selected\r\nalmost at random out of his daily acts of gentleness and true\r\ncharity:--\r\n\r\n     \"I took a poor old bag of bones into my camp a month ago, and\r\n     have been feeding her up, but yesterday she was quietly taken\r\n     off, and now knows all things. She had her tobacco up to the\r\n     last, and died quite quietly.... A wretched _sister_ of yours\r\n     [addressed to the late Miss Gordon] is struggling up the road,\r\n     but she is such a wisp of bones that the wind threatens to\r\n     overthrow her; so she has halted, preferring the rain to being\r\n     cast down. I have sent her some dhoora, which will produce a\r\n     spark of joy in her black and withered carcass. I told my man to\r\n     see her into one of the huts, and thought he had done so. The\r\n     night was stormy and rainy, and when I awoke I heard often a\r\n     crying of a child near my hut within the enclosure. When I got up\r\n     I went out to see what it was, and passing through the gateway, I\r\n     saw your and my sister lying dead in a pool of mud--her black\r\n     brothers had been passing and passing, and had taken no notice of\r\n     her--so I ordered her to be buried, and went on. In the midst of\r\n     the high grass was a baby, about a year or so old, left by\r\n     itself. It had been out all night in the rain, and had been left\r\n     by its mother. I carried it in, and seeing the corpse was not\r\n     moved, I sent again about it, and went with the men to have it\r\n     buried. To my surprise and astonishment, she was alive. After\r\n     considerable trouble I got the black brothers to lift her out of\r\n     the mud, poured some brandy down her throat, and got her into a\r\n     hut with a fire, having the mud washed out of her eyes. She was\r\n     not more than sixteen years of age. There she now lies. I cannot\r\n     help hoping she is floating down with the tide to the haven of\r\n     rest. The next day she was still alive, and the babe, not a year\r\n     old, seized a gourd of milk, and drank it off like a man, and is\r\n     apparently in for the pilgrimage of life. It does not seem the\r\n     worse for its night out, depraved little wretch!... The black\r\n     sister departed this life at 4 P.M., deeply lamented by me, not\r\n     so by her black brothers, who thought her a nuisance. When I went\r\n     to see her this morning I heard the 'lamentations' of something\r\n     on the other side of the hut. I went round, and found another of\r\n     our species, a visitor of ten or twelve months to this globe,\r\n     lying in a pool of mud. I said, 'Here is another foundling!' and\r\n     had it taken up. Its mother came up afterwards, and I mildly\r\n     expostulated with her, remarking, however good it might be for\r\n     the spawn of frogs, it was not good for our species. The creature\r\n     drank milk after this with avidity.\"\r\n\r\nSuch incidents explain the hold Gordon obtained over the indigenous\r\npopulation of the Upper Nile. He made friends right and left, as he\r\nsaid, and the trust of the poor people, who had never received\r\nkindness, and whose ignorance of the first principles of justice was\r\nso complete that he said it would take three generations of sound and\r\npaternal government to accustom them to it, in General Gordon was\r\ncomplete and touching. A chapter might be filled with evidence to this\r\neffect, but it is unnecessary, as the facts are fully set forth in the\r\n\"Letters\" from Central Africa. The result alone need be dwelt on here.\r\nFor only too brief a period, and as the outcome of his personal\r\neffort, these primitive races saw and experienced the beneficial\r\nresults of a sound and well-balanced administration. The light was all\r\ntoo quickly withdrawn; but while it lasted, General Gordon stood out\r\nas a kind of redeemer for the Soudanese. The poor slaves, from whose\r\nlimbs the chains of their oppressors had only just been struck, would\r\ncome round him when anxious about his health, and gently touch him\r\nwith their fingers. The hostile chiefs, hearing, as Bedden did, that\r\nhe restored his cattle to and recompensed in other ways a friendly\r\nchief who had been attacked in mistake, would lie in wait for him, and\r\nlay their views and grievances before him. He could walk fearlessly\r\nand unarmed through their midst, and along the river banks for miles,\r\nwhen an Egyptian official would have required a regiment to guard\r\nhim, and detached soldiers would have been enticed into the long grass\r\nand murdered. Even the hostile tribes like the Bari, who, from a\r\nmistaken view of their own military power, would not come to terms,\r\nshowed their recognition of his merit by avoiding in their attacks the\r\nposts in which he happened to be. Thus there grew up round Gordon in\r\nthe Soudan a sublime reputation for nobleness and goodness that will\r\nlinger on as a tradition, and that, when these remote regions along\r\nthe Equator fall under civilized authority, will simplify the task of\r\ngovernment, provided it be of the same pattern as that dispensed by\r\nGeneral Gordon.\r\n\r\nAs the subject has a permanent practical value, the following passage\r\nembodying General Gordon's views is well worth repetition:--\r\n\r\n     \"I feel sure that a series of bad governments have ruined the\r\n     people. Three generations of good government would scarcely\r\n     regenerate them. Their secretiveness is the result of the fear\r\n     that if they give, it may chance that they may want. Their\r\n     indolence is the result of experience that if they do well, or if\r\n     they do badly, the result will be _nil_ to them, therefore why\r\n     should they exert themselves? Their cowardice is the result of\r\n     the fear of responsibility. They are fallen on so heavily if\r\n     anything goes wrong. Their deceit is the result of fear and want\r\n     of moral courage, as they have no independence in their\r\n     characters. For a foreign power to take this country would be\r\n     most easy. The mass are far from fanatical. They would rejoice in\r\n     a good government, let its religion be what it might. A just\r\n     administration of law, and security of person against arbitrary\r\n     conduct, would do a great deal. It is the Government that needs\r\n     civilizing far more than the people. Mehemet Ali and his\r\n     descendants have always gone on the principle of enriching\r\n     themselves by monopolies of all sorts. None, not even the present\r\n     Khedive (Ismail), have brought in civilizing habits or customs\r\n     with any desire to benefit the country, or, at any rate, they\r\n     have subordinated this desire to that of obtaining an increased\r\n     revenue.\"\r\n\r\nBut while Gordon brought kindness and conciliation into play, the\r\nsettlement of the region entrusted to his care called for sterner\r\nmeasures, and he was not the man, with all his nobility of character\r\nand overflowing supply of the milk of human kindness, to refrain from\r\nthose vigorous and decisive measures that keep turbulent races in\r\nsubjection, and advance the cause of civilization, which in so many\r\nquarters of the world must be synonymous with British supremacy. The\r\nstudent of his voluminous writings will find many passages that\r\nexpress philosophical doubts as to our right to coerce black races,\r\nand to bind peoples who in their rude and primitive fashion are free\r\nto the car of our wide-world Empire. But I am under no obligation to\r\nsave them the trouble of discovery by citing them, more especially\r\nbecause I believe that they give a false impression of the man. I have\r\naffirmed, and shall adduce copious and, as I think, convincing\r\nevidence, at every turn of his varied experiences, that the true\r\nGordon was not the meek, colourless, milk-and-water, text-expounding,\r\ntheological disputant many would have us accept as a kind of Bunyan's\r\nhero, but in action an uncompromising and resistless leader, who, when\r\nhe smote, at once struck his hardest. Gordon has supplied the answer\r\nto his own misgivings as to our moral right to coerce and subject\r\ntribes who advanced their natural claims to be left undisturbed: \"We\r\ncannot have them on our flank, and it is indispensable that they shall\r\nbe subjected.\"\r\n\r\nHaving organised his new forces, equipped all his steamers--one of\r\nwhich was fitted out with machinery that had been left in Baker's time\r\nto rust in the Korosko Desert--General Gordon set himself to the task\r\nof systematically organising the line of posts which he had conceived\r\nand begun to construct in the first stages of his administration. The\r\nobject of these posts was twofold. By them he would cut the slave\r\nroutes in two, and also open a road to the great Lakes of the Equator.\r\nIn the first few months of his residence he had transferred the\r\nprincipal station from Gondokoro to Lardo, twelve miles lower down the\r\nstream, and on the left instead of the right bank of the river. These\r\nplaces lie a little on each side of the fifth degree of north\r\nlatitude, and Gordon fixed upon Lardo as his capital, because it was\r\nfar the healthier. Above Lardo he established at comparatively short\r\nstages further posts at, in their order, Rageef, Beddem, Kerri,\r\nMoogie, and Labore, immediately beyond the last of which occur the\r\nFola Falls, the only obstruction to navigation between Khartoum and\r\nthe Lakes. Above those Falls Gordon established a strong post at\r\nDuffli, and dragged some of his steamers overland, and floated them on\r\nthe short link of the Nile between that place and Lake Albert,\r\nestablishing a final post north of that lake, at Wadelai. When his\r\nfleet commanded that lake, he despatched his lieutenant, Gessi, across\r\nit up the Victoria Nile, connecting the two great lakes, and continued\r\nhis chain of posts along it by Magungo, Anfina, Foweira, and Mrooli,\r\nto the very borders of Mtesa's dominion in Uganda. By means of these\r\ntwelve posts General Gordon established the security of his\r\ncommunications, and he also inspired his men with fresh confidence,\r\nfor, owing to the short distances between them, they always felt sure\r\nof a near place of refuge in the event of any sudden attack. Thus it\r\ncame to pass that whereas formerly Egyptian troops could only move\r\nabout in bodies of 100 strong, General Gordon was able to send his\r\nboats and despatches with only two soldiers in charge of them; and\r\nhaving entirely suppressed the slave-trade within his own\r\njurisdiction, he was left free to accomplish the two ulterior objects\r\nof his mission, viz. the installation of the Khedive's flag on the\r\nLakes, and the establishment of definite relations with Mtesa, whose\r\ntruculent vassal, Kaba Rega, of Unyoro, showed open hostility and\r\nresentment at the threatened encroachment on his preserves.\r\n\r\nIt was neither a reprehensible nor an unintelligible vanity for the\r\nEgyptian ruler to desire the control of the whole of the great river,\r\nwhose source had been traced south of the Equator, and 2000 miles\r\nbeyond the limits of the Pharaohs' dominions. Nor was the desire\r\ndiminished when, without sharing the gratification of the Prince in\r\nwhose name he acted, General Gordon advanced cogent reasons for\r\nestablishing a line of communication from Gondokoro, across the\r\nterritory of Mtesa, with the port of Mombasa on the Indian Ocean. As\r\nGordon pointed out, that place was nearly 1,100 miles from Khartoum,\r\nand only 900 from Mombasa, while the advance to the Lakes increased\r\nthe distance from the one place by nearly 300 miles, and reduced that\r\nto the other in the same measure. This short and advantageous line of\r\ncommunication with the Equatorial Province and Upper Nile was beyond\r\nboth the power and the sphere of the Khedive; but in the task of\r\nwinning one of the most important of African zones formally recognised\r\nas lying within the British sphere of influence, the route advocated\r\nby General Gordon in 1875 has now become of the most undoubted value\r\nand importance.\r\n\r\nThe aversion to all forms of notoriety except that which was\r\ninseparable from his duty led Gordon to shrink from the publicity and\r\ncongratulations sure to follow if he were the first to navigate those\r\ninland seas on the Equator. Having made all the arrangements, and\r\nprovided for the complete security of the task, he decided to baffle\r\nthe plans in his honour of the Royal Geographical Society, by\r\ndelegating the duty of first unfurling the Khedive's flag on their\r\nwaters to his able and much-trusted lieutenant, Gessi. Although he\r\nsometimes took hasty resolutions, in flat opposition to his declared\r\nintentions, he would probably have adhered to this determination but\r\nfor reading in one of Dr Schweinfurth's published lectures that \"it\r\nmay be that Lake Albert belongs to the Nile basin, but it is not a\r\nsettled fact, for there are seventy miles between Foweira and Lake\r\nAlbert never explored, and one is not authorised in making the Nile\r\nleave Lake Albert. The question is very doubtful.\" The accidental\r\nperusal of this passage changed General Gordon's views. He felt that\r\nthis task devolved on him as the responsible administrator of the\r\nwhole region, and that his natural shrinking from trumpery and too\r\noften easily-earned geographical honours, which he has bluntly\r\nasserted should only be granted by the Sovereign, did not justify his\r\nevading a piece of work that came within his day's duty. Therefore he\r\nresolved to ascertain the fact by personal examination, and to set at\r\nrest the doubts expressed by the German traveller.\r\n\r\nExpanding Dr Schweinfurth's remarks, he explained that \"it was\r\ncontended that the Nile did not flow out of Lake Victoria, and thence\r\nthrough Lake Albert, and so northward, but that one river flowed out\r\nof Lake Victoria and another out of Lake Albert, and that these two\r\nrivers united and formed the Nile. This statement could not be\r\npositively denied, inasmuch as no one had actually gone along the\r\nriver from Foweira to Magungo. So I went along it with much suffering,\r\nand settled the question. I also found that from Foweira or Karuma\r\nFalls there was a series of rapids to Murchison Falls, thus _by\r\ndegrees_ getting rid of the 1000-feet difference of level between\r\nFoweira and Magungo.\" While mapping this region, Gordon one day\r\nmarched eighteen miles through jungle and in pouring rain, and on each\r\nof the four following days he also walked fifteen miles--and the month\r\nwas August, only a few miles north of the Equator, or, in other words,\r\nthe very hottest period of the year. Having established the course of\r\nthe Nile and its navigability to the Murchison Falls close to the\r\nVictoria Nyanza, General Gordon gave what he thought was a finishing\r\ntouch to this exploring expedition by effecting an arrangement with\r\nKing Mtesa.\r\n\r\nBut in order to explain the exact significance of this step, and the\r\nconsequent disappointment when it was found that the arrangement was\r\nillusory and destitute of practical value, it is necessary to go back\r\na little, and trace the course of events in the Uganda region.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian advance towards the south brought in its train two\r\nquestions of external policy. One was with Abyssinia, of which we\r\nshall hear much in the next chapter; and the other was with the\r\nkingdom of Uganda and the kinglets who regarded Mtesa as their chief.\r\nOf these the principal was Kaba Rega, chief of Unyoro, and the\r\nrecognised ruler of the territory lying between the two Lakes. He was\r\na man of capacity and spirit, and had raised himself to the position\r\nhe occupied by ousting kinsmen who had superior claims to the\r\nprivileges of supreme authority. In the time of Gordon's predecessor,\r\nSir Samuel Baker, Kaba Rega had come to the front as a native\r\nchampion, resolved to defy the Egyptians and their white leaders to do\r\ntheir worst. In a spirited attack on Baker's camp at Masindi, he\r\nendeavoured to settle the pretensions of his invaders at a blow, but\r\nhe found that numbers were no match for the superior arms of his\r\nopponent. But defeat did not diminish his spirit. Baker decreed his\r\ndeposition as King of Unyoro, proclaiming in his stead a cousin named\r\nRionga, but the order had no practical effect. Kaba Rega retired a\r\nlittle from the vicinity of the Egyptian forces; he retained \"the\r\nmagic stool\" of authority over the lands and peoples of Unyoro, and\r\nhis cousin Rionga possessed nothing beyond the empty title contained\r\nin an Egyptian official decree. This was the position when Gordon\r\nappeared on the scene, and his first obligation was to give something\r\nlike force and reality to the pretensions of Rionga.\r\n\r\nIf Kaba Rega had been satisfied to retain the practical marks of\r\nauthority, it is probable that Gordon would have been well content to\r\nleave him alone, but irritated by the slight placed upon him by Sir\r\nSamuel Baker, he assumed the offensive on every possible occasion. He\r\nattacked Colonel Long, one of Gordon's lieutenants, on his way back\r\nfrom Mtesa, just as he had Baker; he threatened the Egyptian station\r\nat Foweira; and above all, he welcomed the thwarted slave-dealers, who\r\nwere not averse to taking their revenge in any form at Gordon's\r\nexpense. In these circumstances an active policy was forced on General\r\nGordon, who promptly decided that Kaba Rega was \"too treacherous\" to\r\nbe allowed to retain his kingdom, and that measures must be taken to\r\nset up Rionga in his place. It was at this moment, unfortunately, that\r\nGeneral Gordon discovered the worthlessness of his troops, and when,\r\nin 1876, he had organised his new force, and was ready to carry out\r\nthe policy he had decided on in 1874, he was thinking mostly of his\r\ndeparture from the Soudan, and had no time to proceed to extremities\r\nagainst these southern adversaries, for behind Kaba Rega stood Mtesa.\r\n\r\nWhen Gordon, in January 1876, entered the territory of Unyoro,\r\nbelonging to Kaba Rega, he found it desirable to take up the cause of\r\nAnfina, in preference to that of Rionga, as the more influential\r\nchief; but neither proved in popularity or expertness a match for Kaba\r\nRega. The possession of \"the magic stool,\" the ancestral throne or\r\ncopper seat of the family of Unyoro, believed to be identified with\r\nthe fortunes of the little kingdom, alone compensated for the few\r\nlosses in the open field, as Kaba Rega was always careful to retreat\r\non the approach of his most dangerous adversary. Neither of his\r\nkinsmen was likely to prove a formidable foe. Rionga passed his hours\r\nin native excesses, in the joy of receiving the titular rank of Vakil\r\nto the Khedive. Anfina alienated Gordon's friendly feeling by\r\nsuggesting the wholesale assassination of Kaba Rega's officers and\r\nfollowers when they came on a mission to his camp. Kaba Rega carried\r\noff the stool to the south, or rather the west, of Victoria Nyanza,\r\nand bided his time, while Mtesa wrote a half-defiant and\r\nhalf-entreating letter to Gordon, asking him to spare Unyoro. Mtesa\r\nhad his own views of gain, and when Gordon proposed to establish a\r\nfortified post with a garrison of 160 men at Urundogani, the Uganda\r\nruler begged that it might be stationed at his own capital, Dubaga,\r\nwith the view of either winning over the troops to his service or\r\nemploying them against his own enemies. Gordon saw through this\r\nproposal and withheld his consent, but his lieutenant, Nuehr Agha,\r\nacted on his own responsibility, and moved with his force to Dubaga.\r\nIn a few weeks Gordon learnt that they were all, practically speaking,\r\nprisoners, and that his already heavy enough task had been increased\r\nby the necessity of rescuing them.\r\n\r\nGordon accordingly advanced in person to Mrooli, the nearest point to\r\nMtesa's capital without actually crossing his frontier, and as he had\r\nwith him a strong force of his newly-raised black contingent, he felt\r\nconfident of his capacity to punish Mtesa for any act of treachery,\r\nand to annex, if necessary, his kingdom. But Gordon did not wish to\r\nforce a war on Mtesa, or to increase the burdens of the Nile dominion.\r\nAll he wanted was the restoration of the men detained at Dubaga, and\r\nhe soon received assurances that his presence, and the moral effect of\r\nthe force he had brought with him, would attain this result without\r\nany necessity for fighting. As Gordon worded his complaint, it was a\r\ncase not of his wishing to annex Mtesa, but of Mtesa annexing his\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied himself that Mtesa was not willing to risk a quarrel,\r\nGeneral Gordon sent Nuehr Agha with ninety men to bring back the 140\r\nmen detained at Dubaga, and the task was accomplished without any\r\nhitch or delay. This was due partly to the military demonstrations,\r\nand partly also to a clever diplomatic move by Gordon, who wrote to\r\nMtesa expressing his readiness to recognise by treaty the independence\r\nof Uganda, and to provide a safe-conduct for the King's ambassadors to\r\nCairo. At this time the late Dr Emin, who claimed to be an Arab and a\r\nMahommedan, was at Dubaga, but his influence on the course of events\r\nwas _nil_, and he and Gordon never met. After the return of the troops\r\nGordon commenced his retirement to the Nile, and after an arduous and\r\ndangerous march of eighty miles through a swampy jungle beset by Kaba\r\nRega's tribesmen, who were able to throw their spears with accurate\r\naim for fifty yards, he succeeded in reaching Masindi without loss.\r\nThen Gordon drew up a plan of campaign for the effectual subjugation\r\nof Kaba Rega, but he did not wait to see it carried out, as the first\r\nmove could not be made until the grass was dry enough to burn. As soon\r\nas that season arrived three columns were to march against the chief\r\nof Unyoro in the following order--one consisting of 150 black\r\nsoldiers, and 3000 of the Lango tribe, under Rionga, moving from\r\nMrooli to Kisoga; another of about the same strength from Keroto to\r\nMasindi; and the third operating from the Albert Lake with the\r\nsteamer. The plan was a good one, but Kaba Rega, by having recourse to\r\nhis old Fabian tactics, again baffled it.\r\n\r\nAlthough these events happened when Gordon had reached Cairo, it will\r\nbe appropriate to give here the result of this campaign. The Unyoro\r\nchieftain retired before the Egyptians, who carried off much cattle,\r\nand when they in turn retired, he advanced and reoccupied his country.\r\nAfter a brief period the Egyptians definitely gave up their stations\r\nat Mrooli, Foweira, and Masindi, on the left bank of the Victoria\r\nNile, and confined themselves to those on its right bank, and thus\r\nfinally were Mtesa and Kaba Rega left to enjoy their own rude ideas of\r\nindependence and regal power.\r\n\r\nSo far as General Gordon was concerned, the Uganda question was then,\r\nboth for this period and for his subsequent and more important\r\ncommand, definitely closed. But one personal incident remains to be\r\nchronicled. When Gordon received Mtesa's request to garrison Dubaga,\r\nand had actually planted a station on the Victoria Lake, he\r\ntelegraphed the facts to the Khedive, who promptly replied by\r\nconferring on him the Medjidieh Order. At the moment that Gordon\r\nreceived this intimation he had decided that it would not be politic\r\nto comply with Mtesa's request to garrison Dubaga, and he had only\r\njust succeeded in rescuing an Egyptian force from a position of danger\r\nin the manner described. He felt that he had obtained this decoration\r\n\"under false pretences,\" but the recollection of the hard and\r\nhonourable work he had performed must have soon salved his conscience.\r\n\r\nAt an early stage of his work Gordon felt disposed to throw it up, and\r\nduring the whole three years a constant struggle went on within\r\nhimself as to whether he should stay or return to England. Many causes\r\nproduced this feeling. There was, in the first place, disillusionment\r\non discovering that the whole thing, from the Egyptian Government\r\npoint of view, was a sham, and that his name was being made use of to\r\nimpose on Europe. But then he thought he saw an opportunity of doing\r\nsome useful and beneficial work, and, stifling his disappointment, he\r\nwent on. Arrived on the scene, he found himself thwarted by his\r\nEgyptian colleagues, and treated with indifference by the Cairene\r\nGovernment. He also discovered that his troops were worthless, and\r\nthat not one of his officers, civil and military, cared a fig for the\r\ntask in hand. Their one thought was how to do nothing at all, and\r\nGordon's patience and energy were monopolised, and in the end\r\nexhausted, by attempts to extract work from his unwilling\r\nsubordinates. Even the effort to educate them up to the simple\r\nrecognition that a certain amount of work had to be done, and that\r\nunless it were well done, it had to be done over again, resulted in\r\nfailure. To the plain instructions he gave, they would give an\r\ninterpretation of their own; and while fully admitting on explanation\r\nthat this was not the proper way of executing any task, they would\r\ninvariably repeat it after their own fashion, until at length Gordon\r\ncould see no alternative to performing the task himself. Thus were his\r\nlabours indefinitely multiplied, and only his exceptional health and\r\nenergy enabled him to cope with them at all. How much they affected\r\nhim in his own despite may be judged from the exclamation which\r\nescaped him, after he had obtained a considerable success that would\r\nhave elated any other leader--\"But the worry and trouble have taken\r\nall the syrup out of the affair!\"\r\n\r\nThe personal glimpses obtainable of Gordon during these depressing\r\nyears, while engaged on a task he foresaw would be undone by the\r\nweakness and indifference of the Egyptian authorities as soon as he\r\ngave it up, are very illustrative of his energy and inherent capacity\r\nfor command. The world at large was quite indifferent to the heroism\r\nand the self-denial, amounting to self-sacrifice, which alone enabled\r\nhim to carry on his own shoulders, like a modern Atlas, the whole\r\nadministration of a scarcely conquered region, which covered ten\r\ndegrees of latitude. But we who have to consider his career in all its\r\nbearings, and to discover, as it were, behind his public and private\r\nacts, the true man, cannot afford to pass over so lightly passages\r\nthat are in a very special degree indicative of the man's character\r\nand temperament. In no other period of his career did he devote\r\nhimself more strenuously to the details, in themselves monotonous and\r\nuninteresting, of a task that brought him neither present nor\r\nprospective satisfaction. When the tools with which he was supplied\r\nfailed him, as they did at every turn, he threw himself into the\r\nstruggle, and supplied the shortcomings of all the rest. When it was a\r\nmatter of pulling the boats up the river, he was the first at the\r\nropes, and the last to leave them, wading through the water with his\r\ntrousers up. If it was his steamer that had run aground, all the\r\nactive labour, as well as the organisation, fell on him. Sooner than\r\nadd to the work of those in attendance on him, he would be seen\r\npreparing and cooking his own food; and because he could do it better\r\nthan his native servant, he would clean his duck-gun, with the whole\r\ncamp agape, until his ways were realised, at an Excellency doing his\r\nown work. Nor did he spare himself physically. His average day's walk,\r\nwhich satisfied him that he was in good health, was fourteen miles;\r\nbut he often exceeded twenty miles, and on one occasion he even walked\r\nthirty-five miles under a tropical sun. Of the conduct of his soldiers\r\nagainst an enemy, or in coping with the difficulties of river\r\nnavigation, he was always nervous, and whether for work or for\r\nfighting he used, he said, \"to pray them up as he did his men in\r\nChina\"; but without his knowledge, one of his own soldiers was\r\nvigilantly observant of his conduct, and has recorded, through the\r\ninstrumentality of Slatin Pasha, his recollections of Gordon as a\r\nfighter and leader of soldiers:--\r\n\r\n     \"Gordon was indeed a brave man. I was one of his chiefs in the\r\n     fight against the Mima and Khawabir Arabs; it was in the plain of\r\n     Fafa, and a very hot day. The enemy had charged us, and had\r\n     forced back the first line, and their spears were falling thick\r\n     around us; one came within a hair's-breadth of Gordon, but he did\r\n     not seem to mind it at all, and the victory we won was entirely\r\n     due to him and his reserve of 100 men. When the fight was at its\r\n     worst he found time to light a cigarette. Never in my life did I\r\n     see such a thing; and then the following day, when he divided the\r\n     spoil, no one was forgotten, and he kept nothing for himself. He\r\n     was very tender-hearted about women and children, and never\r\n     allowed them to be distributed, as is our custom in war, but he\r\n     fed and clothed them at his own expense, and had them sent to\r\n     their homes as soon as the war was over.\"\r\n\r\nThis picture of Gordon lighting a cigarette in the press of a doubtful\r\nbattle may well be coupled with that already given during the Taeping\r\nrebellion, of his standing unarmed in the breach of an assaulted\r\nstockade, while around him pressed on or wavered the individuals of a\r\nforlorn hope. It will be difficult for anyone to find in all the\r\nannals of war another instance of human courage more nearly\r\napproaching the sublime.\r\n\r\nIn November 1875 General Gordon had fully made up his mind to resign\r\nand return to Cairo, in consequence of the indifference with which he\r\nwas treated by the Khedive's Government, and he had actually written\r\nthe telegrams announcing this intention, and given orders to pack up\r\nthe stores for the passage down the Nile, when the receipt of a long\r\nletter full of praise and encouragement from the Khedive Ismail\r\ninduced him to alter his plans, to tear up the telegrams, and to\r\ncontinue his work. General Gordon gives his reason for changing his\r\nmind very briefly: \"The man had gone to all this expense under the\r\nbelief that I would stick to him; I could not therefore leave him.\" So\r\nhe stayed on for another year. In July 1876 he formally and more\r\ndeliberately resigned, but the execution of this decision had to be\r\npostponed by the necessity he felt under, as already explained, of\r\nsolving the geographical questions connected with the Nile and the\r\nLakes, and also of securing the southern frontier against Kaba Rega\r\nand Mtesa.\r\n\r\nThese tasks accomplished, or placed in the way of accomplishment,\r\nthere remained no let or hindrance to his departure; and by the end of\r\nOctober he was in Khartoum. But even then he felt uncertain as to his\r\nultimate plans, and merely telegraphed to the Cairo authorities that\r\nhe intended to come down for a time. With his back turned on the scene\r\nof his labours, the old desire not to leave his work half done came\r\nover him, and all the personal inconvenience and incessant hardship\r\nand worry of the task were forgotten in the belief that he was called\r\non by God \"to open the country thoroughly to both Lakes.\" He saw very\r\nclearly that what he had accomplished in the three years of his stay\r\ndid not provide a permanent or complete cure of the evils arising out\r\nof the slave-trade and the other accompaniments of misgovernment, and\r\nhe did not like to be beaten, which he admitted he was if he retired\r\nwithout remedying anything. These reflections explain why, even when\r\nleaving, his thoughts were still of returning and resuming the work,\r\nlittle more than commenced, in those Mussulman countries, where he\r\nforesaw a crisis that must come about soon.\r\n\r\nBut these thoughts and considerations did not affect his desire for a\r\nchange to Lower Egypt, or even to visit home; and leaving Khartoum on\r\n12th November he reached Cairo on 2nd December. He then formally\r\nplaced his resignation in the Khedive's hands, but it was neither\r\naccepted nor declined; and the Khedive, in some mysterious manner,\r\nseems to have arrived at the sound conclusion that after a brief rest\r\nGeneral Gordon would sicken of inaction, and that it would be no\r\ndifficult manner to lure him back to that work in the Soudan which had\r\nalready established its spell over him. Of that work, considerable as\r\nit was as the feat of a single man, it need only be said that it would\r\nhave remained transitory in its effect and inconclusive in its results\r\nif General Gordon had finally turned his back on it at the close of\r\nhis tenure of the post of Governor of the Equatorial Province at the\r\nend of the year 1876. When he left Cairo in the middle of December for\r\nEngland there was really very little reason to doubt that at the right\r\nmoment he would be ready to take up the work again.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.
