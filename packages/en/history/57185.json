Apart from compilations,\r\nI have met only one original work on the subject, in the English\r\nlanguage, during the ten years the present work has been in preparation.\r\n\r\nThe publication of thousands of documents dealing with the struggle\r\nfrom the French side by the Historical Section of the French War\r\nOffice, has rendered easily accessible an immense mass of material\r\nfor the earlier period of the campaign. A beginning in this respect\r\nhas also been made by the War Office at St. Petersburg, and some\r\ninteresting light is thereby thrown upon the preparations on the\r\nRussian side, as well as upon the personalities of the Russian leaders.\r\nThere are also many documents from private sources which have been\r\ncollected and published.\r\n\r\nMy aim has been simply to relate the history of the terrible campaign\r\nin straightforward fashion, without obscuring the narrative by too\r\nmuch digression. I believe that, as matters stand, a better service\r\nwill thus have been rendered to the cause of history than by the\r\ncomposition of a huge essentially technical work--for which, indeed,\r\nthere is no place in this country. At present, apart from the needs of\r\nsoldiers--which they are better qualified to supply than myself--it is\r\nnot so much scientific discussion of the campaign that is required as\r\nknowledge of its episodes. This I have conscientiously endeavoured to\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nI have to express my obligations to Mr. F.J. Hudleston, of the Staff\r\nLibrary at the War Office, for permission to make researches among the\r\nworks under his charge dealing with the campaign, as well as to his\r\nassistant, Mr. Baldry, for his kind help during my work there. I am\r\nindebted to Mr. Gordon Home for much invaluable assistance, which it is\r\neasier to name than to classify, since it extends to every part of the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n E.F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n          CHAPTER                                         PAGE\r\n\r\n    I.

A review of the immediate causes of the mighty struggle\r\nis necessary and not without interest, but it is difficult, as one\r\nstudies Napoleon’s character, to resist the conclusion that it was\r\ninevitable. The career of the Corsican adventurer whom genius and good\r\nfortune had made Emperor of France, resembles the fateful development\r\nof a Greek tragedy. By 1812 his pride had reached its height. Whatever\r\nset itself in opposition to his will must be trodden under foot.\r\nRussia, impelled partly by a natural sense of independence, partly by\r\neconomic causes, made up her mind to resist him, and the consequence\r\nwas an attack upon her by the tyrant of south-western Europe.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the Continental system varied in different parts of\r\nEurope, but everywhere they were bad. France, wealthy in herself, and\r\nwith the material advantage of being able to maintain her overgrown\r\narmies at free quarters in foreign countries, felt them least--a\r\nfact which probably accounts for Napoleon’s long continuance in\r\npower. Elsewhere the pressure was cruel, especially in Sweden, which\r\npractically depended for economic existence upon her sea-borne\r\ncommerce. Russia, though self-supporting as regards food supplies,\r\nalso suffered materially from the cessation of her trade with Great\r\nBritain; and the classes which felt the pressure most were those of the\r\nnobles and merchants, which embodied and voiced such public opinion\r\nas existed in the country. There was also in Russia a healthy sense\r\nof independence, coupled with a feeling of possessing such strength\r\nas made destruction, at the hands even of Napoleon, impossible. Such\r\nopinions were certain to penetrate sooner or later to the Tzar and his\r\nadvisers; and, in spite of much irresolution and diversity of views,\r\nthey could not fail to exercise considerable influence. Besides, the\r\ncommencement of a new independent Poland, in the shape of the Grand\r\nDuchy of Warsaw, established by Napoleon on the western frontier of\r\nRussia, was an ever-present source of anger and uneasiness. The Grand\r\nDuchy was, to all intents and purposes, a military camp, a sort of\r\nFrench advanced guard against Russia. Within its bounds everything was\r\nsubordinated to military organisation, and its large army, organised\r\nand trained on French principles, and with French aid, was a very real\r\nmenace.\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s political marriage with Maria Louisa of Austria, at a moment\r\nwhen he was ostensibly negotiating for the hand of Alexander’s sister,\r\nadded to the Tzar’s sense of his people’s sufferings and his empire’s\r\ndanger a feeling of personal injury. Next year this was aggravated by\r\nNapoleon’s abrupt annexation of the coast-lands of north-west Germany,\r\nincluding Oldenburg, whose ruler was Alexander’s brother-in-law. In the\r\nbeginning of 1811 the Tzar issued a commercial decree which virtually\r\nprohibited various French imports into Russia, and also permitted the\r\nimport of Colonial goods under a neutral flag. The measure must, of\r\ncourse, have been under consideration for some time, and Russia’s\r\nfinancial straits amply account for it, but coming as it did on the\r\nheels of Alexander’s protests against the seizure of Oldenburg, it\r\nenraged Napoleon. In a letter to the King of Württemberg he described\r\nit as a declaration of hostility, and, since any movement in the\r\ndirection of independence inevitably called down his furious wrath, he\r\nwas probably right.\r\n\r\nAt the same time these events were scarcely the cause of\r\nhostilities--they merely hastened them. Whatever diplomacy might do,\r\nneither Napoleon nor Alexander had any belief in the permanence of the\r\ntruce which had been called in 1807. Soon after his second marriage\r\nNapoleon had observed to Metternich that war with Russia was in the\r\nnature of things. The retention of strong garrisons in the Prussian\r\nfortresses on the Oder, the steady increase in the forces of the Grand\r\nDuchy of Warsaw, and the continued occupation of Danzig, almost on\r\nthe Russian frontier, were measures which can hardly be regarded as\r\ndirected otherwise than against Russia. Moreover, besides the troops\r\nof Napoleon’s German vassals, an army of 100,000 Frenchmen occupied\r\nGermany. It is absurd to suggest, in the face of all this, that war\r\nwas forced upon Napoleon by Russia--except, of course, in so far as\r\nindependent action of any kind always challenged his hostility.\r\n\r\nWhatever Alexander’s personal feelings might be--and there is no\r\ndoubt that he was to some extent fascinated by the French Emperor’s\r\npersonality--he was gradually forced into the conviction that peace\r\nwas impossible. In 1810 he appointed as War-Minister General Barclay\r\nde Tolly, an officer who had greatly distinguished himself in the\r\nFrench and Swedish wars; and the reorganisation of the Russian forces\r\nwas energetically proceeded with. Count Arakcheiev, Alexander’s harsh\r\nand brutal, but undoubtedly industrious and energetic, minister,\r\nhad already done much, especially in the direction of improving the\r\narsenals and reserves of arms. Barclay’s measures were steadily\r\ndirected to preparing for a war on the western frontier. The country\r\nwas surveyed, roads examined and improved, magazines formed,\r\nfortifications planned and begun, and, above all, troops steadily\r\nconcentrated. Progress was, however, slow. Apart from the backward\r\nstate of the country as a whole, divided counsels in the Imperial\r\nCabinet, the poverty of the exchequer, and the strain of the long\r\nand by no means successful Turkish war, it was necessary to proceed\r\ncautiously, for fear of provoking Napoleon too soon into offensive\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe preparations were, in fact, entirely defensive in character, and\r\nappear very modest beside Napoleon’s vast armaments and fortifications\r\non territory which was not his own. The Russian ministers, indeed,\r\nappear to have been generally rather over-confident of their country’s\r\nability to resist a French invasion. Some of them, at any rate, wished\r\nto take up arms in 1811, counting on the support of Austria and\r\nPrussia. They pointed out that Napoleon would calculate upon Russia’s\r\nsteady weakening owing to loss of trade, and that therefore speedy\r\naction was desirable. The Grand Chancellor, Count Rumiantzev, was a\r\nstrong partisan of the French alliance. Alexander himself, though\r\ndetermined to stand firm against aggression, was not anxious for war,\r\nand apparently hoped that it might be avoided--as indeed it might have\r\nbeen, but for the fact that peace with England, which was desired by,\r\nand necessary to, Russia, implied from Napoleon’s standpoint war with\r\nFrance. The impression which the Russian Government generally conveyed\r\nin foreign countries was one of great irresolution.\r\n\r\nThis impression was indeed somewhat erroneous. The war-party in\r\nRussia was by far the larger of the two into which public opinion was\r\nnaturally divided, since it included nearly everyone whose interests\r\nwere adversely affected by the Continental system--in other words,\r\nthe majority of the nobles and merchants. It was, however, divided,\r\ncomprising a narrowly patriotic section which looked merely to the\r\npreservation of Russian territory, and another, naturally smaller,\r\nconsisting of men who saw more or less clearly that to ensure European\r\npeace Napoleon must be not merely repelled, but crushed once and for\r\nall. The peace-party though small was very influential, including\r\nthe Chancellor Rumiantzev, Alexander’s own mother, and his brother\r\nConstantine.\r\n\r\nUltimately, of course, everything depended upon the character of the\r\nTzar, and this was such as to give the friends of France great hopes\r\nof being able to influence him. Alexander was essentially a dreamer,\r\nmuch under the influence of vaguely exalted aspirations which were\r\nterribly contrasted with the mass of selfishness, luxury, and brutality\r\nwhich environed and repelled him. He was impulsive rather than calmly\r\nand steadily determined, and both at Tilsit and Erfurt Napoleon had\r\ndominated him. Probably he hoped to do so again. He was bitterly\r\ndisappointed, and his vexation inspired the libellous remarks upon\r\nAlexander’s character which occasionally pass for serious history.\r\nAlexander I was neither a great statesman, a great general, nor a\r\nhero. He was, as far as we can see him, a kindly and well-meaning man,\r\nsomewhat dreamy and irresolute in general, called by an inscrutable\r\nprovidence to rule, from the midst of a luxurious Court and through\r\na corrupt bureaucracy, a very backward and undeveloped realm. He was\r\noften shocked by the conditions about him, but lacked the moral courage\r\nto suppress them. But, like many other dreamers, he could at times rise\r\nto the occasion. He was intellectual enough to act both as general\r\nand statesman, by no means with discredit in either case, and morally\r\nelevated enough to play, in 1812, something at any rate of the part of\r\na hero.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Alexander was naturally slow in finally forming his\r\nresolution to fight to the death, and the causes here detailed made\r\npreparations for war also tardy. As it was, however, they were quickly\r\ndetected by Napoleon, and used by him as the grounds for diplomatic\r\nprotests and for pushing forward his own armaments.\r\n\r\nBarclay’s preparations, in brief, included the increase of the\r\nnumber of the regiments of the Russian army, the completion to war\r\nstrength of two battalions per infantry, and four squadrons per\r\ncavalry, regiment; the organisation of depôts to complete the third\r\nbattalions and fifth squadrons with all speed, and the concentration\r\non the western frontier of all available forces--ultimately including\r\n9 army corps, 2 independent divisions, 5 reserve cavalry “corps,”\r\nand 3 corps of irregular horse. Information concerning the state\r\nof Napoleon’s forces, especially in Germany and the Grand Duchy of\r\nWarsaw, was carefully collected, and the possible theatre of war\r\nstudied and surveyed. The fortifications carried out had a purely\r\ndefensive character, and cannot be for a moment compared with\r\nNapoleon’s constant provocative preparations in Germany and Poland.\r\nRiga was fortified, and fortifications were projected at Dünaburg,\r\nwhere the St. Petersburg-Vilna road crossed the Düna. Other works were\r\nplanned at Borisov on the Berezina, where the river is crossed by the\r\nMoscow-Warsaw high-road. Kiev, the famous old Russian city on the\r\nDnieper, was also fortified, as was Bobruisk on the Berezina. A glance\r\nat the map will show how absolutely defensive these fortifications\r\nwere. Riga is 150 miles from the frontier, and all the other places\r\nmuch farther back. As a fact some of them were not completed, hardly\r\neven begun, when war broke out.\r\n\r\nThese preparations were due in their inception to Barclay, but there\r\nwere others which were inspired by the unpractical advisers immediately\r\nabout the Tzar. Wellington’s Torres Vedras campaign had made a great\r\nsensation in Europe, and General Phull, Alexander’s Prussian instructor\r\nand adviser, had projected a great entrenched camp at Drissa, a town\r\nthat was literally nowhere. It covered nothing; it was hardly even\r\ntactically well placed. It is a striking indication of the confusion\r\nin the Russian councils that, practically behind the back of the\r\nWar-Minister who was nominally responsible for military preparations,\r\na vast amount of time and labour was wasted on this pretentious and\r\nunprofitable camp of refuge. In a sentence, Drissa was absolutely\r\nuseless. Yet the man who conceived this almost childish idea of drawing\r\nNapoleon against his will upon an arbitrarily placed entrenchment, and\r\ninducing him to waste time and lives before it, passed for a scientific\r\nsoldier! The amount of time and labour expended on Drissa rendered all\r\nthe other works slow in construction, and Dünaburg was hardly commenced\r\nwhen the war broke out.\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s preparations were naturally influenced by no chimerical\r\nideas--except in so far as he appeared inclined to renew in 1811 his\r\nold plan of an invasion by sea of England! All through 1810 and 1811\r\nthe arming and strengthening of German and Polish fortresses was\r\ncontinued, and the bulk of the disposable French troops were collected\r\nin three so-called corps of observation in the northern provinces and\r\nin Germany. They numbered some 200,000 men. From Italy he could draw\r\nabout 50,000 French and Italian troops. The contingents of his German\r\nvassals numbered nearly 130,000. The Grand Duchy of Warsaw could\r\nfurnish some 50,000. Prussia was practically helpless, and Napoleon\r\nimposed upon her a treaty of alliance which required her to furnish\r\n20,000 men, and subjected her to wholesale plunder by the _Grande\r\nArmée_ on its passage through her territories. Napoleon was to make\r\nsuch requisitions as he pleased, and payment was to be arranged for\r\nthem later! The misery caused, however, unfortunately for him, did not\r\ndestroy Prussia, and only added to the heavy debt of vengeance soon\r\nto be paid. For the moment, however, Prussia had reached the depths\r\nof humiliation. Austria, though sorely humbled and distressed, was in\r\na far more independent position; and Metternich’s address succeeded\r\nin concluding a treaty by which Austria was to be indemnified for\r\nany territorial losses that she might sustain by a reconstitution of\r\nPoland, and should furnish an auxiliary corps of about 30,000 men.\r\nThere was, of course, no guarantee that Napoleon would keep the first\r\ncondition, and in all probability he would never have done so had\r\nthe contemplated events come to pass; but that he consented to it,\r\neven nominally, indicates that he was anxious to conciliate Austria.\r\nAustria, on her side, furnished to the _Grande Armée_ some 40,000 men\r\nin all.\r\n\r\nHaving completed these arrangements Austria and Prussia promptly\r\ncommunicated them to Russia! Despite the grim seriousness of the\r\nsituation, and the terrible drama which was soon to be acted, it is\r\ndifficult not to see that Napoleon’s position was a somewhat ludicrous\r\none. Austria gave Alexander full assurances that no attack should be\r\nmade upon Russia by any but the auxiliary corps, and communicated to\r\nhim the secret orders given to the troops in Galicia and Transylvania!\r\n\r\nPoland--or the fraction of it represented by the Grand Duchy of\r\nWarsaw--was, naturally and necessarily, heart and soul with Napoleon.\r\nFrance had always been the model to which the Poles looked up; and\r\nsince the Partition they regarded France as their natural helper.\r\nThey had fought in the French ranks in large numbers during the\r\nRevolutionary and Napoleonic wars, and there was undoubtedly much\r\nsympathy of a kind felt for them in France. Farther than this feeling\r\ndid not go. The chivalry with which the French national character\r\nis credited by its admirers certainly does not appear in history.\r\nFrench diplomatic annals are to the full as soiled as those of other\r\ncountries, and French soldiers have usually been ruthless interpreters\r\nor breakers of the rules of war. And most certainly the natural\r\ninstincts of the French people are essentially material. In so far as\r\nPoland was useful to France, France was very ready to sympathise with\r\nher. Otherwise the general opinion of the Poles, later expressed by the\r\npoet Gaszinski, is that they have obtained from France only tears!\r\n\r\nNapoleon was, of course, fully alive to the advantages to be reaped\r\nfrom Polish enthusiasm and aspirations. Besides the army of Warsaw he\r\nbrought up to the front all his own Polish regiments so as to give\r\nhis operations as far as possible the appearance of a war for the\r\nrestoration of Polish independence. Eventually in 1812 he sent De\r\nPradt to Warsaw to organise the movement against Russia. He gave him\r\ndetailed instructions as to how he was to carry out his orders, and it\r\nis hardly possible to read them without feelings of indignation against\r\nthe man who ruthlessly traded upon the aspirations of a brave and\r\npatriotic people, and of pity for the people themselves. The ambassador\r\nhimself was very conscious of the ignominious part which he was called\r\nupon to play. To all appearance he did his work well; certainly the\r\npoverty-stricken and requisition-wasted Grand Duchy raised a very\r\nlarge force for the campaign. Napoleon, however, chose later to be\r\ndissatisfied; and at St. Helena violently attacked De Pradt, as a chief\r\ncause of his defeat--a statement which may fairly be included in the\r\nmass of falsehoods which Napoleon emitted during his captivity.\r\n\r\nOn January 27th, 1812, Napoleon issued to his German vassals a\r\ndeclaration of his complaints against Russia, and required them to have\r\ntheir contingents ready by the 15th of February. The Army of Italy was\r\nordered to march into Germany, and the King of Bavaria to clear the\r\nroads of snow and to supply it during its march through his territory.\r\nThe troops were to live at free quarters; if they were not supplied\r\nwith all that they required they were to take it! Anyone insulting\r\na French soldier was to be court-martialled, and the sentences of\r\nprejudiced and often brutalised judges may be imagined. It is, of\r\ncourse, needless to add that both these orders were suppressed by the\r\neditors of Napoleon’s correspondence. In order to extract additional\r\nsupplies the Army of Italy was stated at 80,000 strong, its actual\r\nnumbers being about 45,000. When Napoleon’s allies were thus oppressed,\r\none may imagine the misery in Prussia, which was treated as a conquered\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAll this time Napoleon and Alexander were negotiating, though with\r\nsmall chance of a peaceful result. Alexander desired peace, but\r\nwould not surrender his independence: Napoleon required complete\r\nsubmission. Alexander sent his aide-de-camp, Colonel Chernishev,\r\non a special mission to Paris, while at St. Petersburg the French\r\nAmbassador, Caulaincourt, was replaced by General Lauriston. Early in\r\n1812 Napoleon induced the King of Prussia to send a special envoy to\r\nSt. Petersburg, with the suggestion that Alexander might make fresh\r\nproposals. Alexander made a dignified reply: he had, he said, shown\r\nhis strong desire for peace by keeping silent upon the subject of\r\nNapoleon’s annexations: at the same time he was willing to hear what\r\nexplanations France might have to offer. None were made, and French\r\ntroops continued to flood across Germany. Napoleon believed that the\r\nRussian preparations were more advanced than they actually were--this\r\nis fairly apparent from his military correspondence--and was anxious to\r\ngain time. In April Alexander sent to Prince Kurakin, his ambassador\r\nat Paris, final instructions. He was to propose that Prussia be fully\r\nevacuated by the French, thus leaving a neutral space between the\r\ncontending powers. Russia would then be ready to satisfy France--or\r\nNapoleon--on commercial questions. It can hardly be doubted that,\r\ncome what might, Alexander did not intend entirely to return to the\r\nContinental system, and so far Napoleon was probably right in deeming\r\nthe proposal a diplomatic move to gain time. He made no reply, but\r\ndespatched Count Narbonne on a shadowy mission to Alexander at Vilna,\r\nand kept Kurakin, with studied insolence, waiting. The ambassador\r\npressed repeatedly for a reply, but received none until nearly three\r\nweeks later. Then he was merely asked if he had full powers to treat!\r\nHe rightly regarded such treatment as a gratuitous insult, and demanded\r\nhis passports. Narbonne’s mission naturally led to nothing, except that\r\nhe obtained a better idea than Napoleon of the stern determination of\r\nthe erstwhile soft and yielding Tzar.\r\n\r\nAlexander, on his side, was endeavouring to free his hands for the\r\napproaching struggle. The result of the Treaty of Tilsit had been the\r\nlong and harassing war with Turkey; and Russia paid dearly for the\r\nblunder into which Napoleon’s blandishments had led her. Negotiations\r\nfor peace were very slow, and steadily opposed and hampered by the\r\nFrench ambassador at Constantinople. Peace was not signed at Bukharest\r\nuntil May, 1812, and even then French influence was still so powerful\r\nthat there was fear that it would be broken by Turkey. It was not\r\nuntil August that the bulk of the Army of the Danube at last started\r\nfrom Bukharest under Admiral Chichagov, and by that time Napoleon was\r\nalready on the line of the Düna and the Dnieper. As it happened the\r\ndelay was fortunate for Russia, but it might easily have been fatal.\r\n\r\nYet more important to Russia than peace with the Osmanli Empire was\r\npeace with Great Britain, but in order to keep the gate of conciliation\r\nopen for Napoleon until the last moment formal negotiations were not\r\ncommenced until April, 1812. In point of fact, though the two powers\r\nwere nominally at war, and the British fleet was blockading the\r\nRussian ports, there was a very good feeling between them. Through\r\nthe Spanish envoy Zea Bermudez, Lord Wellesley had in 1811 assured\r\nAlexander that Britain was not really hostile, and Alexander in turn\r\nhad promised Bermudez that he would keep his troops on the Polish\r\nfrontier, so as to ensure that the suspicious French Emperor would\r\nnot move more troops from Germany into Spain. Admiral de Saumarez,\r\nthe fine seaman and excellent diplomatist who commanded the British\r\nBaltic fleet, handled the situation with unerring tact and skill,\r\nand effectively ensured the doing of nothing which might destroy the\r\ncomparatively friendly relations which subsisted between the two\r\nnominally hostile states. All this is doubly interesting, as proving\r\nthe hopelessly fragile basis upon which Napoleon’s European domination\r\nrested.\r\n\r\nRussia’s first overtures were somewhat clumsy and exorbitant in their\r\ndemands. They suggested that since Russia was obviously about to render\r\nvital services to the common cause Britain should take over a loan\r\nof nearly £4,000,000 just raised by her. The refusal of the British\r\nGovernment to accede to this demand, in itself not inexcusable, but\r\nfailing to recognise Britain’s own difficulties and the services which\r\nshe was rendering, rather dashed the Russian Government, and the formal\r\nalliance was not concluded until July.\r\n\r\nFinally, it may be noted that Napoleon, before entering upon\r\nhostilities, went through the time-honoured farce of making overtures\r\nof peace to Britain. It was purely a diplomatic move, and certainly\r\nnot seriously intended, nor did the British Government regard it as\r\nbeing so. Britain was more confident than she had been for a long time.\r\nThe French offensive in the Peninsula had very definitely reached its\r\nlimit, and Wellington, by his capture of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz,\r\nhad taken the first steps in the great counter-attack which was\r\neventually to roll the French back over the Pyrenees. Calm observers\r\nlike Foy saw that the turn of the tide had come. It may be regarded as\r\ncertain that terms of peace less unfavourable than those which Napoleon\r\noffered would hardly have been accepted.\r\n\r\nSweden, under the direction of Napoleon’s old enemy and restive\r\nservant, Bernadotte, also allied herself with Russia in April--an act\r\nimmediately brought about by Napoleon’s arrogant seizure of Swedish\r\nPomerania, but perhaps in the end inevitable. Sweden, however, partly\r\nowing to poverty, partly because of Britain’s unwillingness to abet\r\nBernadotte’s designs on Norway, took no active share in the Continental\r\nwar until 1813; but Russia was enabled to withdraw most of her troops\r\nfrom Finland for service against Napoleon.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the French and Russian preparations for war were actively\r\npursued, though more rapidly and effectively by Napoleon than by his\r\nantagonist, who had to contend with far greater difficulties. On\r\nFebruary 8th Napoleon ordered Prince Eugène with the Army of Italy and\r\nthe Bavarians to advance upon Glogau, where they would arrive about\r\nApril 1st. Davout’s six divisions were advanced stage by stage from\r\nthe Elbe to the Vistula, while the 2nd Corps (Oudinot) and the 3rd\r\n(Ney) followed in support. The Poles (5th Corps) were concentrated on\r\nthe Vistula about Warsaw, Modlin and Plock; and the Saxons (7th Corps)\r\nand Westphalians (8th Corps) directed also upon Warsaw. Two corps\r\nof cavalry reserves--22,000 lances and sabres--and gunners of horse\r\nartillery were in the north; a third, 10,000 strong, with Eugène; and\r\na fourth, not yet completely formed, was to accompany the 5th, 7th and\r\n8th Corps. The Prussian contingent was assembling at Königsberg, the\r\nAustrian at Lemberg. Finally the Imperial Guard, horse and foot, was\r\nadvancing from Paris to form the general reserve. Over and above all\r\nthese formations, which composed the actual army of invasion, various\r\nreserve divisions, French, Polish and German, were being organised,\r\nsome of which were later combined into a 9th Army Corps under Marshal\r\nVictor. The refractory conscripts, who were being trained in their\r\nisland prison-camps, were formed into fresh regiments of infantry.\r\nThe conscripts of the year, who were collecting at the depôts, were\r\norganised as soon as sufficiently trained into _Regiments de Marche_\r\nwhich were pushed forward into and through Germany to feed the\r\nfighting line. Out of these an 11th Corps was formed, the composition\r\nof which was constantly changing as the advanced troops were pushed\r\nacross the Russian frontier, to be replaced by others at the rearward\r\nstages, while these were in their turn relieved by new conscripts from\r\nFrance. A division of King Joachim’s Neapolitans was marching from\r\nItaly to form part of this great reserve corps. The King of Denmark\r\nalso, at Napoleon’s request, concentrated a division of 10,000 troops\r\nin Holstein. Napoleon did not believe that Britain could seriously\r\nmolest his rear owing to her preoccupation with the Peninsular War,\r\nbut he took no risks. In March, 1812, a Senatus-Consultum formed the\r\nentire male population of the empire into three _bans_, and of the\r\nfirst _ban_, comprising men from twenty to twenty-six years of age, a\r\nhundred battalions or “cohorts” were immediately called out for home\r\ndefence. They actually produced a force of about 80,000 men, who by\r\nJune had received a fair amount of training. Apart from them there were\r\nleft for the defence of the empire 2 regiments of the Young Guard, 24\r\nline battalions in 8 regiments of infantry, 8 foreign battalions, 8\r\nsquadrons of cavalry and 48 batteries of artillery. There were also 156\r\n3rd, 4th and 5th battalions of regiments already on foreign service,\r\nthe seamen, marines, coast-guards and veterans, and finally the depôts\r\nof the whole army.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1812, when Napoleon was preparing to concentrate\r\non the Oder, the Russian forces, exclusive of the isolated armies of\r\nTurkey and Finland, lay dispersed in cantonments from Courland to\r\nPodolia, over a line of some six hundred miles. During March and April,\r\nas the French offensive on the Vistula became pronounced, Alexander\r\ndrew in his scattered forces and organised them in two armies, calling\r\nup reinforcements from the Turkish frontier. The first army, under\r\nthe War-Minister Barclay de Tolly, had its head-quarters at Vilna.\r\nThe second, commanded by the fiery Georgian Prince Peter Bagration,\r\nwas cantoned about Lutsk. Napoleon interpreted this to mean that\r\nRussia intended to invade the Grand Duchy of Warsaw with Bagration’s\r\narmy, while Barclay covered the road to St. Petersburg. It is indeed\r\nprobable, if not certain, that had their preparations been more forward\r\nthe Russians would have attempted something of the kind; Bagration\r\nwas eager to advance on Warsaw. The plans discussed at the Russian\r\nhead-quarters all appear to be based upon the the hypothesis of being\r\nable to meet the French near the frontier on fairly equal terms.\r\nNapoleon’s overwhelming strength was not yet appreciated.\r\n\r\nOn April 17th Napoleon wrote to Davout, laying down the plan of action\r\nwhich he proposed in view of a Russian advance on Warsaw. The 60,000\r\nmen of the Saxon and Polish armies would, if possible, hold the line of\r\nthe Vistula about Warsaw, but if overmatched must retreat on Glogau,\r\nwhere Davout would be able to come into line with them, while the\r\nmain body of the Grand Army came up to the relief in two columns. He\r\nshowed his confidence in his lieutenant by inviting him to examine and\r\ncriticise the proposed plan.\r\n\r\nAt this date the French forces were approximately stationed as follows,\r\nleft to right. The Prussians were about Königsberg, and Davout’s six\r\ninfantry divisions and a cavalry corps between Danzig and Thorn, all\r\nthese forming what General Bonnal calls the Strategic Advanced Guard,\r\nunder Davout. The 5th Corps was between Plock and Warsaw, the 7th Corps\r\nnear Kalisch, 140 miles west of Warsaw, the 8th Corps between Glogau\r\nand Kalisch. The Bavarians (6th Corps) were marching from Glogau to\r\nPosen; the Army of Italy (4th Corps) was spread out over 100 miles of\r\nroad in rear of Glogau; Ney was with the 3rd Corps about Frankfort on\r\nthe Oder, eighty miles north-west of Glogau, and Oudinot with the 2nd\r\nabout Berlin. As Bagration at Lutsk was some 250 miles from Warsaw,\r\na study of the map will show that an offensive movement on his part\r\ncould be opposed by at least equal numbers (the 5th, 7th and 8th Corps)\r\nin any case, apart from the 4th and 6th, which could be diverted on\r\nWarsaw, while a mass of over 200,000 men (Davout, Prussians, 2nd Corps,\r\n3rd Corps and 2 cavalry corps) could oppose Barclay, besides the Guard.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of April Napoleon obtained fairly accurate information\r\nof the Russian emplacements. Six Army Corps and 3 divisions of reserve\r\ncavalry were extended from near Shavli in Courland to Slonim in\r\nLithuania--a distance of nearly 250 miles. At Lutsk, over 200 miles\r\nfrom Slonim, and separated from it by the huge barrier of the Pinsk\r\nMarshes, were 2 Corps under Bagration, while slowly converging upon\r\nLutsk were 5 divisions of infantry and 2 of cavalry. He could therefore\r\ncalculate with sufficient certainty that his strategic deployment along\r\nthe Vistula would not be interrupted. By May 15th the bulk of his\r\nforces were on the Vistula from Danzig to Warsaw. The Prussians were\r\nat Königsberg, the Austrians at Lemberg, the 4th Corps in reserve at\r\nKalisch, the Imperial Guards marching in detachments across Germany.\r\nThe whole mass, exclusive of non-combatants, amounted to nearly 450,000\r\nmen, of whom 80,000 were cavalry. It had with it, including its reserve\r\nparks, 1146 guns and howitzers, nearly 200,000 horses and draft\r\nanimals, and probably 25,000 vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the suffering entailed by the passage of this gigantic\r\nhost through Germany may be imagined. The mere supplying it with\r\nfood was enough to exhaust the country, but it was but a part of\r\nwhat had to be endured. The peasants were robbed of horses, vehicles\r\nand implements for the service of the troops, and forced themselves\r\nto accompany the columns to drive their carts laden with baggage\r\nor their own plundered crops. Honourable men in the French army\r\nsaw such proceedings with shame and regret. De Fezensac tells with\r\nill-suppressed indignation how he met German peasants fifty leagues\r\nfrom their homes acting as baggage drivers, and adds that they were\r\nfortunate if they reached their villages in a state of beggary.\r\nTestimony such as this is invaluable and damning. Organised plunder was\r\nrampant, and the French officers, brutalised and morally degraded by\r\nyears of war maintaining war, were reckless of the misery inflicted.\r\nThe Prussian official Schön tells how Davout, on entering Gumbinnen\r\nand finding supplies in his opinion not adequate, owing to the abject\r\npoverty to which Prussia had been reduced, coolly ordered his troops\r\nto pillage the town! The 1st Corps was the best administered in the\r\narmy; and Davout is commonly held up to admiration by French writers\r\nas the pattern of honour and loyalty. But his execution of orders was\r\ncommonly ruthless, and there were in Napoleon’s army but too many\r\nofficers who lacked even Davout’s very limited sense of honour. Davout\r\nwould sack a town remorselessly, as readily as Suchet massacred women\r\nand children at Lerida; but Suchet would hang a man who committed\r\nmurder, and Davout, while subjecting people to every kind of officially\r\nordered oppression, would sternly check private plunder or outrage. But\r\nother generals were less strict, and the bad characters who are found\r\nin every army had opportunities of committing all kinds of outrages.\r\nNapoleon himself at last complained of the misconduct of Ney’s 3rd\r\nCorps. Ney was a worse disciplinarian than Davout, though a humane and\r\nkindly tempered man, but neither Ney nor Davout can really be blamed.\r\nThe troops, by Napoleon’s order, were to be supplied at the expense\r\nof the country, and the usual discipline of the French army was so\r\nshattered by years of organised brigandage that the rest naturally\r\nfollowed. The terrible misery inflicted upon Germany and other\r\ncountries by Napoleonic warfare may be studied at length in reports and\r\ndespatches, and furnishes a very grim commentary upon the moral value\r\nof military discipline.\r\n\r\nNapoleon left Paris on the 9th of May, accompanied by the Empress, and\r\nreached Dresden on the 16th, where all his unwilling or willing allies\r\nand vassals were gathered to meet him. The details of his stay--how\r\nkings waited in his antechamber, how he made presents to them, how\r\nqueens waited upon Maria Louisa--need not be repeated. The episode was\r\na memorable example of pride preceding a fall.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was not impatient. He had already told Davout that he should\r\nnot commence operations until the grass had grown in order that he\r\nmight therewith supplement his stores of forage; and he did not\r\nleave Dresden until the 30th of May. On that day the whole army was\r\nconcentrated between Königsberg and Warsaw; the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th\r\nCorps were all in line, and the Guard was collecting at Posen. Napoleon\r\nin his orders for the advance on the Niemen, on May 26th, contemplates\r\nthe army as three masses: the right, consisting of the 5th, 7th and 8th\r\nCorps, under Jerome; the centre, of the 4th and 6th, under Eugène; and\r\nthe left, of the Guard, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd, and the new 10th Corps\r\n(Davout’s foreign division and the Prussians) which he would conduct in\r\nperson. Two Reserve Cavalry Corps were allotted to the left, one to the\r\ncentre, and one to the right.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the Russian side, the Emperor Alexander had arrived at\r\nVilna on April 26th. As Emperor he nominally had the chief command, but\r\nunfortunately his motley following of German princes and relatives,\r\nmilitary adventurers and theorists, had much more to suggest than the\r\nharassed sovereign, who must at times have been almost in despair\r\nat being called upon to decide between them. There were lengthy\r\ndiscussions and much drafting of strategic schemes, few of them at\r\nall applicable to the situation and resulting in little but waste of\r\ntime. Barclay was practically superseded by the Emperor’s following,\r\nand being naturally a man of diffident and retiring nature, and unused\r\nto supreme command, he did not sufficiently assert himself. Among the\r\nofficers who appeared in Alexander’s suite was old General Bennigsen,\r\nwho had commanded not without credit against Napoleon in 1807, and\r\nprobably hoped to induce the Tzar to give him an important command.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nPRINCE EUGÈNE\r\n\r\nSon of the ex-Empress Josephine, Viceroy of Italy, and Commander of the\r\n4th French Army Corps\r\n\r\nFrom the picture by Scheffer at Versailles]\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of June it was becoming clear that Napoleon’s attack\r\nwould be delivered across the Niemen. Bagration was thereupon ordered\r\nto leave a corps, under General Tormazov, to defend Volhynia against\r\nthe Austrians about Lemberg, and to march with the 7th and 8th Corps\r\nthrough the Pinsk Marshes to Pruzhani. This movement appears to have\r\nescaped Napoleon until the last. As the French continued to advance,\r\ninclining more and more to the left, and pushing forward in dense\r\nmasses into the north-east corner of Prussia, Bagration moved on to\r\nVolkovisk, about 100 miles south-southwest of Vilna, Napoleon believing\r\nhim to be still at Lutsk and Brest-Litovsk.\r\n\r\nThus in the early days of June all was prepared for the opening of the\r\ngrand drama. The hostile armies faced each other on a front of about\r\n170 miles, with a distance of from 100 to 200 miles separating their\r\nmain masses. Considerably to the southward, the Austrians, under Prince\r\nSchwarzenberg, and the army of General Tormazov confronted each other\r\non the Galician frontier, and would evidently fight an independent\r\ncontest. On May 30th Napoleon left Dresden for the front, and with his\r\narrival at Gumbinnen on June 17th, after a detour by Thorn, Danzig and\r\nKönigsberg in order to inspect the depôts at those places, the campaign\r\nmay be said to have definitely commenced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON’S ARMY AND ITS GENERALS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe army with which Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812 was the largest\r\nwhich he had yet commanded, and almost certainly the largest that had\r\never been gathered for the purposes of a campaign under the leadership\r\nof a single man. None the less it was too small for its task, and\r\nwhen, on August 23rd, Napoleon left Smolensk on the last stage of\r\nthe advance on Moscow, his communications were already inadequately\r\nguarded. A greater defect was its lack of homogeneity. Even in the\r\nnominally French regiments which formed the core of the vast host there\r\nwere great numbers of troops drawn from the German, Dutch, Flemish and\r\nItalian provinces of the Empire. Round this nucleus were ranged masses\r\nof allies from almost every country in southern and western Europe.\r\n\r\nThe French Imperial Army in 1812 contained 107 regiments of infantry of\r\nthe line and 31 of light infantry--138 in all. According to numeration\r\nthere should have been 164, but 26 had disappeared from the roll for\r\nvarious reasons. During 1812 several new regiments were formed, chiefly\r\nfrom the _conscrits réfractaires_--men who had endeavoured to escape\r\nthe remorseless conscription, and were confined and trained in special\r\nremote camps.\r\n\r\nAn infantry regiment comprised 1 depôt battalion and from 2 to 5 field\r\nbattalions, each of 6 companies of 140 officers and men. One company\r\nconsisted of Grenadiers and 1 of Voltigeurs; the former were chosen\r\nfor height and strength, the latter, whose duties were those of\r\nskirmishers, for activity. All were, however, armed with the flintlock\r\nmusket, though that of the Voltigeurs was of a lighter and improved\r\npattern. Voltigeur sergeants carried a special _carabine_. Sappers were\r\narmed with a _mousqueton_ or carbine. All these weapons were fitted\r\nwith a triangular bayonet. Fire training was frequently of a very\r\nelementary character. The number of cartridges carried on the person\r\nwas from 50 to 60.\r\n\r\nNon-commissioned officers, Grenadiers and Sappers, were provided with\r\na short sabre (_sabre-bricquet_) in addition to their fire-arms.\r\nMusicians also were armed with swords.\r\n\r\nThe total weight carried on the march, including weapons, ammunition,\r\nrations, kit, and share of camping essentials, was about 50 English\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nThe line cavalry comprised 16 regiments of Cuirassiers and\r\n_Carabiniers_, 24 of Dragoons, 28 of _Chasseurs-à-cheval_, 11 of\r\nHussars, and 9 of _Chevau-légers_. The last were special regiments\r\ndesigned to accompany the heavy Cuirassiers, who were ill adapted for\r\nperforming scouting and outpost duty. Each cavalry regiment had, as\r\na rule, 1 depôt squadron and 4 field squadrons, each of 2 companies\r\nof 125 officers and men, or a total of 1000 sabres. _Chevau-léger_\r\nregiments appear to have had only 3 field squadrons.\r\n\r\nCuirassiers were protected by steel helmets and cuirasses. The cuirass\r\ncovered both back and breast, and weighed about 15 pounds. The\r\nbreastplate was theoretically bullet-proof at a range of 40 metres,\r\nand really seems to have afforded fairly adequate protection, judging\r\nfrom the small proportion of killed and wounded among the cuirassier\r\nofficers disabled at Borodino. Cuirassiers were armed with a long,\r\nstraight sword and a pair of pistols. Dragoons carried in addition\r\na carbine. _Chasseurs-à-cheval_ and Hussars had carbine, pistol and\r\na curved sabre. In the _Chevau-léger_ regiments two-thirds of the\r\ntroopers were armed with lance, sabre and one pistol; the remainder\r\nhad, in place of the lance, a carbine in order to perform skirmishing\r\nand outpost duties.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry was largely mounted upon horses of German breed; but even\r\nso the supply was hardly adequate. Besides, many of the horses were too\r\nyoung, and the hardships of the war destroyed them at a rate which was\r\nsteadily on the increase. The pace of the charges was never the wild\r\ngallop familiar to us from many a spirited but inaccurate painting. A\r\ntrot was the best that Cuirassiers could usually do, and light cavalry\r\nwas often little faster.\r\n\r\nIt has become a kind of legend that Napoleon’s artillery was always\r\nhis strongest arm, but this was by no means the case. In his earlier\r\ncampaigns he was weak in artillery; in 1805 and 1806 he had but 5 guns\r\nto 3000 men. It is true that his gunners were generally better trained\r\nthan their opponents; but at Eylau at any rate this hardly compensated\r\nfor numerical inferiority, the French having only some 250 guns to\r\noppose to 460 Russian pieces. At Aspern, again, Napoleon put only some\r\n200 guns into the field against more than 300 admirably served Austrian\r\ncannon. His infantry also was evidently deteriorating in quality, and\r\nneeded the moral as well as the physical support of powerful batteries.\r\nIn and after 1809, therefore, Napoleon greatly augmented his field\r\nartillery. He also revived a practice of very doubtful utility in\r\nattaching to each regiment of infantry 2 or 4 light guns, served by a\r\ndetachment of regimental gunners. The experiment had very qualified\r\nsuccess; corps commanders were inclined to regard the regimental\r\nartillery as a mere nuisance. It would surely have been better to\r\nattach batteries of regular artillery to the regiments.\r\n\r\nThere were 9 22-company regiments of foot artillery, 43 companies\r\nof horse artillery in 6 regiments, and 27 6-company battalions of\r\nartillery train. The company of foot artillery consisted of 120\r\nofficers and men, that of horse artillery of 100. A battery consisted\r\nof a company of artillery and a company or half-company of train.\r\n\r\nThe field and horse artillery was armed with 12- and 6-pounder guns\r\nand 32- and 24-pounder howitzers. There were also some 4-pounders. A\r\nbattery usually contained 4 or 6 guns and 2 howitzers. The regimental\r\nguns were light 3-pounders.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the artillery was high. Many of its officers had made\r\na scientific study of their profession; and the force as a whole was\r\nhighly trained. The material was good, but British officers considered\r\nit much inferior to that of their own army. Manoeuvring was for the\r\nfoot artillery a slow process, and for the rapid formation of his great\r\npreparatory batteries Napoleon was generally obliged to rely upon the\r\nhorse artillery.\r\n\r\nThe technical troops were sufficient in number, admirable in quality,\r\nand directed by scientific officers. All through the Napoleonic wars\r\nthe engineers did splendid service, and never was their skill and\r\ndevotion more evident than in Russia. The construction and maintenance\r\nof the bridges of the Berezina, amid every kind of misery and\r\ndisadvantage, is perhaps the fairest leaf on the crown of the French\r\nengineers.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, realising that in thinly peopled Russia he could not wage\r\nwar as in Germany, had made great exertions to organise a transport\r\nservice, especially for the conveyance of food supplies. There were 26\r\nbattalions. Most of these had each 252 four-horsed waggons, each waggon\r\nwith a load of 1500 kilogrammes. Four of them had 600 light carts,\r\neach with a load of 600 kilogrammes; and 4 were supplied each with 600\r\nox-waggons with a capacity of 1000 kilogrammes. The oxen were later to\r\nbe killed and eaten--a foolish idea, which it is needless to say could\r\nnot be carried out. Overworked draft cattle cannot be used for food.\r\nIn practice the transport broke down hopelessly. Despite ruthless\r\nplundering in Prussia it was short of draft beasts from the outset. So,\r\ntoo, was the artillery, and it may be imagined that when horses were\r\nfound the latter appropriated them as a matter of course. Forage was\r\nscarce. Finally there were hardly any roads which would bear the weight\r\nof the trains. They soon fell far to the rear, and from the first there\r\nwas a shortage of supplies at the front.\r\n\r\nDistinct from the army as a whole was the Imperial Guard. The inception\r\nof this force dated from 1800, when Napoleon formed a “Consular Guard”\r\nof 2 infantry and 2 cavalry regiments, selected from men who had served\r\nfour campaigns. In 1806 and 1807 fresh regiments were raised on the\r\nsame principle, and then numerous battalions of picked recruits. When\r\nHolland was incorporated in the Empire the Dutch Guards were also\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\nThe Old Guard comprised 3 regiments of Grenadiers (1 Dutch) and 2 of\r\nChasseurs. The infantry of the New or Young Guard included 1 regiment\r\nof “Fusilier-Grenadiers” and 1 of “Fusilier-Chasseurs,” formed in 1806,\r\n6 regiments of Tirailleurs (Sharpshooters), 7 of Voltigeurs, and 1 of\r\n“Flanqueurs-Chasseurs.” The last was a new regiment. The Voltigeurs and\r\nTirailleurs had for the most part served two campaigns in Spain, and\r\nwere seasoned troops. The 2nd and 3rd regiments of each arm remained\r\nin Spain, and the 7th Voltigeurs in France. All the other regiments\r\nwent to Russia. They formed one division of the Old Guard and two of\r\nthe Young Guard. The “Legion of the Vistula”--3 regiments of veteran\r\nPolish troops--was attached to the Guard on entering Russia. All Guard\r\ninfantry regiments consisted of 2 field battalions, generally weaker\r\nthan line units.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry included the two original regiments of the old Consular\r\nGuard, the Chasseurs-à-cheval and the Grenadiers-à-cheval, and\r\na Dragoon regiment. These were French. There were also 2 Lancer\r\nregiments, 1 Dutch, 1 Polish. Guard cavalry regiments had 5 field\r\nsquadrons. There were 2 squadrons of Gendarmerie d’Élite, and the\r\ncelebrated Mameluke company--a troop of Oriental cavaliers.\r\n\r\nThe artillery of the Guard consisted of 10 foot and 4 horse artillery\r\ncompanies with their train. In August, 1812, the foot batteries\r\nwere armed (apparently) with 32 4-pounder guns, 18 6-pounders, 24\r\n12-pounders, and 14 32- and 24-pounder howitzers; the horse batteries\r\nwith 16 6-pounder guns and 8 24-pounder howitzers. The Guard also\r\npossessed its own service of engineers, and eight companies of seaman\r\nfor work on coasts or inland waters.\r\n\r\nThe pay of the Guards was higher than that of the troops of the line,\r\nand non-commissioned officers ranked with line subalterns. The Guards\r\nwere envied and disliked by the line troops, who regarded them as a\r\npampered corps. Napoleon certainly nursed them as far as possible, and\r\nin 1812 they were only in action, as a body, on a single occasion.\r\nThe idea that they were the deciding factor in all Napoleon’s great\r\nvictories is without foundation.\r\n\r\nMarshal Berthier, as Prince of Neufchâtel, was attended at\r\nhead-quarters by a battalion of Guards raised in his own principality;\r\nand a troop of specially selected horsemen formed Napoleon’s personal\r\nescort. During the campaign a battalion of Hesse-Darmstadt Guards,\r\nunder Prince Emil, and a regiment of Portuguese light cavalry were also\r\nattached to head-quarters.\r\n\r\nThe higher organisation of the army was by brigades, divisions, and\r\narmy corps of infantry or cavalry as the case might be. The strength of\r\nthese units varied greatly. A brigade of infantry often consisted of\r\na single large regiment; and divisions varied in the number of their\r\nbattalions from 6 to 22. Compans’ division of Davout’s corps was equal\r\nin strength to the two Westphalian divisions taken together. The army\r\ncorps also varied much in strength, owing to Napoleon’s reasonable\r\npractice of entrusting specially talented generals with greater numbers\r\nthan less able officers. The 1st Corps of the Grand Army in 1812\r\nconsisted of five large divisions, and totalled some 72,000 men; while\r\nthe entire Westphalian Corps counted only 18,000.\r\n\r\nThe science of clothing soldiers simply and sensibly is so little\r\nunderstood even to-day that it can hardly be sought in 1812. There was\r\nless of polish and pipeclay in the French army than in that of Great\r\nBritain; but the uniforms were frequently as comfortless and awkward\r\nas they well could be. One wonders how the men could march and fight\r\nin them. The headgear was often especially clumsy and absurd. To deal\r\nwith the many types of uniform would need a separate work. The infantry\r\nwere generally attired in the blue uniform coat which had replaced the\r\nBourbon white at the Revolution. Cuirassiers wore blue; Dragoons green;\r\nChasseurs and Hussars green, with facings of every colour. In general\r\nit seems that there was a good deal of rather tawdry display about the\r\nuniforms of Napoleon’s soldiers. Love of ostentation appears to be so\r\ndeeply emplanted in the French character that at this day the abolition\r\nof the old glaring uniforms has been much delayed.\r\n\r\nThe soldier’s daily rations consisted of, roughly, 28 ounces of bread,\r\n4 ounces of vegetables or 2 of rice, 10 ounces of meat, and beer or\r\nwine according to the country. French soldiers, with their national\r\ngenius for cookery, were adepts at making themselves comfortable;\r\nand when rations were regularly distributed they fared well enough.\r\nBut Napoleon’s system of subsisting his armies on the country would\r\nnot work in Russia. Even in Germany in 1806, and still more in 1813,\r\nthe troops were often in dire distress for food. In 1812 almost from\r\nthe first it was impossible to keep up any regular distribution of\r\nrations. The soldiers were reduced to marauding for supplies, but in\r\na poor country they were often not procurable, and the unfortunate\r\nmen early began to feel the pinch of want. Napoleon did his best. He\r\nordered the construction of bakeries at every halting-place; but orders\r\ncan effect little without materials, and the latter were frequently\r\nlacking. The rye of Russia, also, did not suit the stomachs of men\r\naccustomed to flour ground from other grains; and the quality both of\r\nflour and bread was generally bad. Herds of beef-cattle were driven\r\nwith the army, but their flesh rapidly deteriorated under the effects\r\nof bad fodder and fatigue. Generally speaking, the periods when the\r\nGrand Army was not living from hand to mouth were few, even on the\r\nadvance. During the retreat it was half-starved at best.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DETAILS OF THE UNIFORMS OF THE INFANTRY OF THE FRENCH\r\nARMY IN 1812\r\n\r\nFrom “_Uniformes de l’Armée française_.” By Lienhart and Humbert\r\n\r\n_By permission of the publisher, Moritz Ruhl, Leipzig_]\r\n\r\nIn the disorganisation of the transport the hospital service fared\r\nbadly. There was a fairly adequate staff of surgeons and medical\r\nofficers; but their efforts--often devoted and persevering in the\r\nhighest degree--could effect little when supplies of every kind were\r\nlacking. On the outward route, no less than the return, men died in\r\nthousands by the roadsides, uncared for and unnoticed. Nearly half\r\nthe Bavarian Corps died or was invalided without seeing an enemy. The\r\nhospitals were inadequate and badly equipped from the outset; later on\r\ntheir condition became too frightful for words. All whom ill-fortune or\r\nduty brought into contact with them describe them in terms of horror.\r\nThey eventually became mere charnel-houses, in which men were left to\r\nperish in thousands of every kind of misery.\r\n\r\nThe French army in 1812 was undoubtedly, from the military standpoint,\r\nthe best organised in Europe; but its officers, as a whole, left\r\nmuch to be desired. The rapid increase of the numbers of the rank\r\nand file since 1806 had involved the improvisation of thousands of\r\nofficers, often from doubtful material. The best of the regimental\r\nofficers were those who united education to practical experience,\r\nbut they were relatively few in number. The cadets of the military\r\nschool were admirable material, but naturally lacked experience and,\r\nas De Fezensac adds, the physical strength which was so necessary.\r\nBut besides those classes of educated officers there was a third\r\ncomposed of promoted sergeants, whose education was, as a rule,\r\nelementary. One of them, the worthy Staff-Captain Coignet, tells us in\r\nhis delightful autobiography that he did not learn to write until he\r\nwas thirty-three years of age! He was, indeed, a man of much natural\r\nsagacity, and keenly regretted his deficiencies; but it is obvious that\r\nthese illiterate men can scarcely have made good company officers.\r\nThe officers of the artillery and engineers were indeed generally\r\nexcellent; but many of those of the cavalry, though dashing leaders on\r\nthe field, possessed little solid knowledge of the duties of their arm,\r\nand the work of keeping in touch with the enemy was often very badly\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nAs regards their ideas of personal ease the French officers were no\r\nbetter than their opponents. Their private vehicles and baggage swelled\r\nthe trains to gigantic dimensions--a fact which contributed much to the\r\ndisasters of the retreat.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the rank and file was by no means what it had been in\r\nthe great years of Austerlitz and Jena. The bloody campaign of 1807\r\nhad created gaps not easily to be filled at the time, and the Austrian\r\nand Peninsular wars deprived the army of the leisure necessary for\r\nit to repair its losses. The French divisions of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd\r\nand 4th Army Corps contained many old regiments, but even in them\r\nthere was a large proportion of recruits; and there were a number\r\nof regiments, belonging to newly annexed provinces, which were not\r\naltogether trustworthy. Their material--the sturdy peasantry of the Low\r\nCountries and North Germany--was excellent, and their conduct on the\r\nfield usually irreproachable; but their administration and discipline\r\nleft much to be desired. Their bad condition was continually exercising\r\nthe soul of the order-loving Davout. In one despatch he describes the\r\nDutch 33rd Léger as _canaille_, and declares in disgust that he can do\r\nnothing with it. Ney likewise complained of the 129th, and pointed out\r\nthat it would have been better to draft the recruits of which it was\r\ncomposed into older regiments. It is probable that Napoleon’s object in\r\nforming new units was to train as many officers as possible.\r\n\r\nThe deterioration of the troops rendered it necessary to employ deep\r\ntactical formations, with consequent risk of heavy losses. The usual\r\nformations for attacking infantry were (1) the “column of companies,”\r\nin which each battalion advanced with its companies in three-deep line,\r\none behind another, and (2) the “column of divisions,” with a front\r\nof two companies instead of one. At best the front was narrow and the\r\nvolume of fire proportionately weak, even when, as was usual, each\r\nbattalion was preceded by a skirmishing line of Voltigeurs. Napoleon\r\nwas fully aware of the fire weakness of these attack formations, and\r\nrecommended as the ideal the _ordre mixte_ in which battalions in\r\ncolumn alternated with others in line. This order, like the others,\r\nfailed hopelessly against the British two-deep line which brought\r\nevery musket into action; and it is remarkable that able French\r\ngenerals continued to employ it when its inefficiency had been so\r\nclearly demonstrated. It is at least probable that the excitable and\r\nimaginative French soldiery could not advance steadily in line. At any\r\nrate, French tacticians trusted, to the end, in the thick skirmishing\r\nline which preceded the advance being able to clear a way for the\r\nmasses behind. As the Russians, with less intelligent and (on the\r\nwhole) worse trained troops, adopted similar tactics, the problems\r\nwhich troubled the French in Spain did not arise in Russia.\r\n\r\nThe French cavalry was excellent on the field, but otherwise often\r\nunsatisfactory. In scouting and outpost work it was inefficient; more\r\nthan once during the campaign touch with the Russians was entirely\r\nlost. No doubt much of this inefficiency was due to the exhaustion of\r\nthe horses. Forage was generally scarce, and to losses from fatigue and\r\nlack of food were soon added those in action. The men were frequently\r\npoor horse-masters. Murat took no care for the mounts, and over-worked\r\nhis force from the first. When the central army began its retreat only\r\n15,000 horsemen remained mounted, and none but the Guard regiments were\r\nreally fit for service.\r\n\r\nConcerning the internal condition of the French army something must\r\nbe said. With the old soldiers devotion to their leader was still\r\nthe watchword; but it would be a grave mistake to imagine that this\r\nsentiment was universal, especially among the better educated elements\r\nof the army. Yet the loyalty of the troops, as a whole, admits of no\r\ndoubt. Sir Robert Wilson and De Fezensac are at one in bearing witness\r\nto this. The desire for plunder no doubt counted for something, but it\r\nwas hunger rather than greed that made the French soldier a marauder.\r\nThe spirit of brigandage was indeed rife in the army, and infected\r\neveryone from the commanders downward. On the whole, it may fairly\r\nbe said that in the ranks the sense of loyalty was strong and the\r\ngeneral spirit good, but that discipline was often badly maintained\r\nand naturally tended to become more and more relaxed as hardships\r\nincreased. Further, it may be observed that while there were numbers\r\nof irreproachable men among the officers, there were also many greedy\r\nadventurers, besides those who were demoralised, like their men, by\r\nyears of predatory warfare. Finally, there was, of course, in the army\r\nthe ruffianly element, which is never absent. To this element must be\r\nattributed the commission of most of the atrocities which undoubtedly\r\ntook place, and for which the whole army had later to suffer. One\r\nfurther point must be touched upon. The evidence as to the presence\r\nof women and children with the army, especially during the retreat,\r\nis abundant and overwhelming. This unhappy element consisted, in the\r\nfirst place, of female camp-followers--_vivandières_, _cantinières_\r\nand the like--mostly the wives of soldiers. Some of the officers, at\r\nany rate, were ill-advised enough to take their wives with them. The\r\nforeign population of Moscow mostly awaited the invaders, and fled\r\nwith them in fear of Russian vengeance. Finally, the morals of the\r\nFrench army in sexual matters can only be described as low, at any rate\r\nfrom the British standpoint. Napoleon himself was not so much immoral\r\nas unmoral--not that there is any absolute proof that he gave way to\r\nhis passions during the Russian campaign--and many of his officers\r\nfollowed his example. On the whole, it seems clear that for one reason\r\nor another the invading army was burdened with thousands of women and\r\nchildren, whose sufferings during the retreat constituted probably its\r\nmost harrowing feature.\r\n\r\nThe troops of the allied states who accompanied and outnumbered the\r\nFrench were, generally speaking, the fair equals on the field of their\r\ncomrades-in-arms. The Bavarians, Westphalians and Württembergers all\r\nbehaved splendidly; and some of the finest fighting in the war was\r\naccomplished by the Berg and Baden regiments at the passage of the\r\nBerezina. The Italians fought admirably at the one general action at\r\nwhich they had the fortune to be present. The great Polish contingent\r\nperformed splendid service for the man to whom Poland looked for its\r\nrestoration to the roll of independent nations. Nor can any fault be\r\nfound with the conduct in battle of the Spanish and Portuguese troops,\r\nthough they were no better than prisoners, serving by compulsion. The\r\nAustrians and Prussians generally took no very prominent part in the\r\ncampaign; but what they did was by no means to their discredit.\r\n\r\nIt was in administration rather than fighting quality that the allied\r\ntroops fell below the French standard. They were also generally\r\nso badly supplied that the best administration could have effected\r\nlittle to improve their lot. The fine Bavarian and Württemberg troops\r\nwasted away by half before they had seen an enemy, and the Poles, to\r\njudge from Poniatowski’s despatches, were often little better off.\r\nThat the Spaniards and Portuguese supplied more than their proportion\r\nof deserters and pillagers is merely what might have been expected,\r\nand the same may be said of the Croats and Illyrians, whose interest\r\nin the war in which they were sacrificed was absolutely _nil_. Yet,\r\non the whole, it cannot well be said that the foreign troops showed\r\nconspicuously worse discipline than their French comrades, though\r\ndoubtless the general mixture of races and languages tended to lower\r\nthe general standard.\r\n\r\nAs to the absolute quality of the allied troops it is very difficult to\r\nspeak. The German and Swiss infantry were very solid and good, though\r\nof course the quality of the different contingents varied, and perhaps\r\nthe Bavarians, Württembergers and Badeners rose above the general\r\nlevel. The Saxon cavalry were admirable, and probably the best in the\r\nentire _Grande Armée_. The German artillery also, especially that of\r\nWürttemberg, was good.\r\n\r\nThe best of the Polish troops were very good indeed; but the regiments\r\nwere largely composed of raw recruits, hastily raised for the great\r\neffort which, as the Poles of Warsaw fondly hoped, was to re-establish\r\ntheir national existence. The cavalry was good; the infantry less so.\r\nDiscipline does not appear to have been very satisfactory; the officers\r\nincluded too many _Pans_, owing their commissions to their noble birth.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians were probably the best disciplined and best officered of\r\nall the allied troops. The general quality of the Austrians, also, was\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, it cannot be doubted that the _Grande Armée_ of 1812\r\nwas too heterogeneous, and that its quality was not of the best. Much\r\nof it had been hastily raised; and its enormous numbers merely added\r\nto the difficulty of provisioning it and, in consequence, to its misery\r\nand losses. General Bonnal thinks that Napoleon, when he collected the\r\ngigantic force, was more or less suffering from megalomania; and that\r\nhe would have achieved more had he depended upon a Franco-Polish first\r\nline of about 250,000 troops, perfectly organised, disciplined and\r\nsupplied. The point is certainly worthy of consideration.\r\n\r\nSomething must be said of the commanders who, under the direction\r\nof Napoleon, conducted the greatest of his armies during the most\r\nambitious and disastrous of his campaigns.\r\n\r\nFor Napoleon himself a very few words must suffice. More has probably\r\nbeen written about him than of any other single figure in history.\r\nNo good purpose can here be served by anything more than some brief\r\nanimadversions upon the share which he himself had in the catastrophe\r\nof 1812.\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s position as the greatest military leader of modern times\r\nis as yet unchallenged; and it is needless therefore to discuss it.\r\nIn 1812 he was, as far as years go, a comparatively young man. He was\r\nbarely forty-three; his bodily energy and capacity of endurance were\r\nyet enormous. Nevertheless, he was not the Napoleon of 1800 and 1805.\r\nHe had grown stout and somewhat unwieldy; and his gross habit of body\r\nmust at times have affected his mind. Nor is it possible to ignore\r\nthe first-hand evidence as to his indifferent health on more than one\r\nimportant occasion.\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s fierce and impetuous nature always made light of obstacles,\r\nand lack of patience was certainly a very pronounced feature in his\r\ncharacter. Wellington is said to have remarked that it incapacitated\r\nthe Emperor from defensive action in 1814, when circumstances\r\nimperatively demanded it.\r\n\r\nFinally, Napoleon in 1812 was ruler as well as general; and political\r\nconsiderations probably had something to do with his adoption of\r\ncourses of action indefensible from the military standpoint.\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s natural impatience, and his rage at being unable to strike\r\na crushing blow, will probably explain the fatal rush in August past\r\nSmolensk on to Moscow. Bodily suffering appears to the author to\r\naccount satisfactorily for his undoubted lack of energy at Borodino.\r\nThe fatal delay at Moscow may fairly be attributed to a combination of\r\npolitical circumstances and not entirely unfounded optimism as regards\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nFor some of Napoleon’s amazing blunders on the retreat reasons such as\r\nthese will hardly account. The fatal dispersion of the marching columns\r\nalong 60 miles of road, even after passing Smolensk, when the army was\r\nalready worn down to a mere remnant; the unnecessarily slow pace of the\r\nmarch, the burning of the pontoon train previous to the passage of the\r\nBerezina, are cases in point; and can hardly be attributed to anything\r\nsave declining intellectual powers.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it seems difficult to deny that Napoleon, in 1812,\r\nhad definitely entered upon his decline; that his perception was\r\nless clear than of old; that his bodily energy had decayed; that his\r\ngenius, though still capable of burning brightly, now only blazed forth\r\nfitfully. Certainly there were times during the Moscow campaign when it\r\nappeared to be almost extinct.\r\n\r\nMarshal Berthier, Prince of Neufchâtel, served in 1812, as in every\r\ncampaign of Napoleon since 1796, as chief-of-staff. His methodical\r\nhabits and untiring industry, coupled with his complete familiarity\r\nwith Napoleon’s character, rendered him indispensable to the latter.\r\nHis military talents were not remarkable, and his general position\r\nwas rather that of a confidential secretary than that of a modern\r\nchief-of-staff--for whom, indeed, there was no place near a man of\r\nNapoleon’s essentially despotic temperament.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nMARSHAL DAVOUT\r\n\r\nCommander of the 1st French Army Corps\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by Gautherdt at Versailles]\r\n\r\nMarshal Louis Nicolas Davout, Prince of Eckmuhl and Duke of Auërstadt,\r\ncommander of the huge 1st _Corps d’Armée_, was probably the best of\r\nall Napoleon’s generals, though he never had such opportunities of\r\ndistinguishing himself in independent command as were granted to\r\nMasséna and Soult. He was a fine example of the modern scientific\r\nsoldier, a stern disciplinarian and an admirable administrator, with a\r\npassion for order and method; and very careful of his men. The charges\r\nof cruelty brought against him do not appear to the author to have been\r\nsatisfactorily made out--certainly not according to the standards of\r\nhumanity generally accepted in Continental warfare. At the same time,\r\nthere was undoubtedly a harsh and rough side to his character, and\r\nhe seems to have lacked self-control and tact. Davout had excellent\r\nstrategic insight, and his tactical ability and tenacity in action had\r\nbeen frequently and brilliantly demonstrated. He took a distinguished\r\npart in the first half of the campaign of 1812, but rather failed in\r\nthe unaccustomed post of rear-guard commander. Men of his methodical\r\nhabit of mind are probably ill-fitted to shine in such a turmoil of\r\nmisery and disorder as the retreat from Moscow.\r\n\r\nMarshal Oudinot, Duke of Reggio, was a hard-fighting veteran of\r\nthe Revolution, who had received his bâton for services rendered\r\nin supporting Davout at Wagram. He was an excellent subordinate,\r\nbut failed in separate command like so many of Napoleon’s generals,\r\nthough his action previous to the passage of the Berezina was highly\r\nmeritorious.\r\n\r\nMichel Ney, Duke of Elchingen, Marshal of France, reaped most of the\r\ncredit gained by Napoleon’s generals in 1812. Ney is commonly regarded\r\nas a mere hard fighter, but he was fairly well educated, and to all\r\nappearance a careful administrator. Among the papers of the French War\r\nOffice relating to 1812 is an order in which he carefully instructs his\r\nsuffering troops how to cook the unground grain which was their only\r\nfood. As a strategist Ney did not excel, and he failed in independent\r\ncommand, but he was a fine tactician, and as a corps commander probably\r\nunsurpassed. His famous title “Le Brave des Braves” fairly sums up his\r\ncharacter. His courage was indeed of that nobler type which rises to\r\nits height at the moment when that of meaner men declines.\r\n\r\nPrince Eugène, Viceroy of Italy, son of the ex-Empress Josephine, was\r\nby virtue of his Imperial rank the commander of the army of Italy.\r\nHe was brave, disinterested and devoted to his stepfather, but his\r\nmilitary talents were not great, and he lacked experience. In 1809\r\nhe had been opposed to a commander even less capable than himself,\r\nand his officers and soldiers had helped him successfully out of his\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nPrince Joseph Anthony Poniatowski, nephew of the last King of Poland,\r\ncould hardly have been passed over in appointing a commander for the\r\n5th (Polish) Army Corps; especially as he was Minister of War of the\r\nGrand Duchy of Warsaw. He was brave and popular with his men, but\r\npossessed of no great capacity, and was indolent and pleasure loving.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gouvion St. Cyr, who was promoted Marshal for his victory\r\nover Wittgenstein at Polotsk in August, was a very capable though\r\ndisaffected officer, who had, as far as good service counted for\r\nanything, won his bâton long before.\r\n\r\nGeneral Reynier, the commander of the Saxon 7th Corps, was a\r\nhard-fighting, experienced soldier of no special ability, and extremely\r\nunfortunate in war. Junot, who took over the Westphalian Corps from\r\nKing Jerome, owed his position chiefly to Napoleon’s friendship for him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nPRINCE JOSEPH ANTHONY PONIATOWSKI, NEPHEW OF STANISLAUS AUGUSTUS, THE\r\nLAST KING OF POLAND\r\n\r\nCommander of the 5th (Polish) Corps of the Grand Army\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by T.A. Vauchelet at Versailles]\r\n\r\nKing Jerome Napoleon of Westphalia would probably have done well\r\nenough at the head of the troops of his own kingdom; his courage, as\r\nhe showed at Waterloo, was beyond question. But to place him in\r\ncommand of three army corps, operating in a difficult country, and\r\ncharged with a vitally important mission, was a gigantic blunder on\r\nthe part of Napoleon. It is no especial discredit to Jerome that he\r\nfailed so completely. General Bonnal observes that he cannot be blamed\r\nfor transgressing military principles with which he had never been\r\nacquainted.\r\n\r\nMarshal Victor, the commander of the 9th Corps, was an experienced\r\nofficer, but had been very unfortunate in the Peninsula against the\r\nBritish.\r\n\r\nMarshal Macdonald, commanding the 10th Corps, took a very small part in\r\nthe campaign; and, unless he had special orders, cannot be said to have\r\ndisplayed much activity. He was a man of high personal character and a\r\ngood hard-fighting corps commander, but of no eminence as a general.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, during the latter part of his career, was repeatedly accused\r\nof placing his relations in positions for which they were not fitted.\r\nThe case of King Jerome is one in point; so also perhaps, to a certain\r\nextent, is that of Napoleon’s celebrated brother-in-law, Joachim\r\nMurat, King of Naples, commander of the Cavalry Reserves. Audacity and\r\ntactical ability on the field Murat certainly possessed, but he was\r\nhardly a great cavalry leader. His outpost and reconnaissance work was\r\noften very badly performed, and his impetuosity caused him to overwork\r\nand harass his men and horses. He lacked stability of character and\r\nsteadiness in adversity, as he was soon to show. Yet as King of Naples\r\nhe possesses more than one title to esteem, and in his character,\r\namidst vanity and absurdity, there was much that was elevated and noble.\r\n\r\nThe commanders of the four corps under Murat’s orders were all men of\r\nexperience as cavalry leaders. The best of them, perhaps, was Nansouty,\r\nat any rate in his own estimation, but the name of Grouchy is better\r\nknown in Great Britain. Montbrun and Latour-Maubourg had seen much\r\nservice in Spain.\r\n\r\nMarshal Lefebvre, Duke of Dantzic, commander of the Old Guard, was much\r\nattached to Napoleon, but otherwise merely a rough, honest old soldier\r\nof little strategic or tactical ability. His title was much better\r\ndeserved by the brilliant engineer, General Chasseloup, who accompanied\r\nthe army in 1812 as chief of his branch of the service.\r\n\r\nMarshal Mortier, Duke of Treviso, commander of the Young Guard, was an\r\nexcellent corps commander, as had been demonstrated in Spain.\r\n\r\nMarshal Bessières, Duke of Istria, had been associated with the cavalry\r\nof the Guard since its formation. He was a fine cavalry leader, and a\r\nman of integrity and devotion to his chief, otherwise deserving of no\r\nspecial mention.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, Napoleon’s commanding officers had one great\r\ndefect. With few exceptions they had become so habituated to submission\r\nto the dominating personality of the Emperor that they had lost all\r\npower of initiative.\r\n\r\nIn an army so huge and of such experience there were naturally many\r\nofficers who in a less warlike age would have been acclaimed as great\r\ngenerals. The majority of the divisional and brigade leaders were\r\nexcellent, though some were already wearing out. Several of them--men\r\nsuch as Verdier--had had considerable experience in independent\r\ncommand, and some had acquired therein a by no means savoury\r\nreputation. Gudin, the leader of Davout’s 3rd Division, was perhaps the\r\nmost distinguished as a soldier, but his colleagues Friant, Morand,\r\nDesaix and Compans were all fine officers. Legrand, Merle, Verdier,\r\nLedru, Marchand, Broussier, Pino, Bruyère, Sebastiani, St. Germain,\r\nClaparède, Tharreau, and others were men of considerable merit and\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nOf the General Staff it may be said that it had scarcely any affinity\r\nwith the board of specially trained officers which accompanies and\r\nassists a modern commander-in-chief. Napoleon’s absorption, in his\r\nsingle person, of all military and administrative functions had reduced\r\nit to a position of complete insignificance. For all practical purposes\r\nit was nothing but a mass of orderlies, and though it contained many\r\ntalented and meritorious officers they had small opportunity of\r\ndistinguishing themselves so long as they remained members of it.\r\nNapoleon in one moment of exasperation declared that “the General Staff\r\nis organised in such a manner that nothing is foreseen.” The remark was\r\nmore or less true; but that such a state of affairs could exist is a\r\nvery severe comment upon his methods. The invading host was, in short,\r\nthe army of a despot who endeavoured to supervise everything himself\r\nand discouraged initiative in others, with the natural result that much\r\nthat might have been done to minimise the catastrophe was not attempted.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of the invading army and its composition, according to the\r\nstates and peoples who contributed contingents, are given in detail in\r\nAppendices A and B. Roughly it may be said that during the campaign\r\nNapoleon disposed of the following numbers:--\r\n\r\nFirst Line\r\n\r\n Head-quarters; Imperial Guard;                  }\r\n   1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 10th, }\r\n   Corps;                                        }  449,000\r\n Austrian Corps; Cavalry Reserve                 }\r\n\r\nSecond Line\r\n\r\n 9th Corps; Polish and Lithuanian levies;        }\r\n 2 French Divisions;                             }  165,000\r\n German Troops, Drafts, Parks, etc.              }\r\n\r\nThird Line\r\n\r\n Drafts and organised troops in touch with       }\r\n   Russians at close of campaign, including      }   60,000\r\n   garrisons of Danzig and on Vistula            }\r\n                                                   --------\r\n                                                    674,000\r\n\r\nThe composition by nations of the first two lines may be stated as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n French and New French                              302,000\r\n Germans and Swiss                                  190,000\r\n Poles and Lithuanians                               90,000\r\n Italians, Illyrians, Spaniards, Portuguese          32,000\r\n                                                   --------\r\n                                                    614,000\r\n                                                   --------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE RUSSIAN ARMY AND ITS GENERALS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circumstance which most impresses the reader who for the first\r\ntime, and without knowledge of the conditions, peruses the story of\r\nthe Franco-Russian campaign of 1812 is that the forces of Russia were,\r\nas compared with those of Napoleon, very weak. This weakness in war is\r\nfamiliar enough to all students of Russian history, nor are the reasons\r\nfar to seek. Since, however, it must appear peculiar to all who regard\r\nRussia as a power essentially huge and powerful--the “Colossus of the\r\nNorth”--its causes must be briefly reviewed.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Russia is a country of vast extent; but her huge\r\nterritory, to-day very imperfectly developed, was in 1812 largely\r\nin an almost primeval condition, while the population was even more\r\nsparsely distributed. The country was and is covered in many places\r\nby wide expanses of almost impenetrable forest, and by vast tracts of\r\nmorass. In the western provinces the marshes of Pinsk cover an area\r\nof more than 20,000 square miles; and in 1812 they were pierced by\r\nonly three indifferent roads. The majority of the numerous rivers do\r\nnot in themselves present grave obstacles to intercommunication or\r\nmilitary operations, being in summer shallow and easily fordable, and\r\nin winter usually frozen over, but they are often wide, and frequently\r\nhave soft or sandy beds. The larger of them must be negotiated by means\r\nof bridges, and in 1812 bridges were few. Moreover, in Central Russia\r\nthe soil is generally yielding and sandy, and every small stream has\r\nhollowed for itself in the course of ages a gully more or less deep.\r\nThese gullies, repeatedly recurring, presented considerable obstacles,\r\nespecially since they were rarely bridged.\r\n\r\nThe distances to be traversed were and are enormous. Readers of\r\nHerodotus will remember how the prospect of the three months’ march\r\nfrom Miletus to Susa frightened Kleomenes and the elders of Sparta. To\r\ntransfer troops from the Caucasus to St. Petersburg in 1812 involved a\r\njourney of even greater magnitude--without the aid of the Royal Road of\r\nPersia. Even to-day the Russian roads are comparatively few and bad. In\r\n1812 it was infinitely worse. The few high-roads were frequently very\r\nbadly maintained; cross-roads of use for military purposes were almost\r\nnon-existent.\r\n\r\nFinally, Russia was as undeveloped politically as economically. The\r\nbulk of the peasantry were serfs chained to the soil. The accepted\r\nmethod of enrolling them for the national defence was to call upon the\r\nnobles, who owned the greater part of the land, for a levy of so many\r\nper hundred or thousand souls. Their interests naturally induced them\r\nto endeavour to retain the best and most industrious of their serfs,\r\nand to furnish for the army the ill-conditioned or idle, as far as\r\npossible. In a country in which corruption has always been rampant\r\nthe recruiting officials were doubtless amenable to the influence of\r\njudicious bribery, and the actual result of a military levy was often\r\nfar less than it should have been. The slowness of communication, the\r\ngeneral poverty of the Government, the lack of factories of clothing,\r\narms and ammunition, added to the difficulty of rapidly and efficiently\r\nincreasing the armed strength. In 1812 Russia was suffering also from\r\nan almost complete cessation of commerce, the result of the British\r\nblockade of her coasts brought on by the alliance with Napoleon in\r\n1807, and the financial difficulties were in consequence even greater\r\nthan usual.\r\n\r\nThe Russian army, since its organisation on European methods by Peter\r\nthe Great, has usually tended to be a rather crude and imperfect copy\r\nof the most modern force of the time. In 1812 French ideas naturally\r\npredominated, and their influence was apparent in many respects,\r\nespecially in the direction of the higher organisations.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1810, as already noted, General Barclay de Tolly became\r\nMinister of War in Russia, and set himself earnestly, with the support\r\nof the Emperor, to reorganise the army. Divided counsels near the Tzar,\r\nand the adverse influence of the conditions above detailed, rendered\r\nthe execution of his plans slow and difficult. Nevertheless, a great\r\ndeal was effected, and whatever opinions may be held as to Barclay’s\r\nmilitary ability there can be no doubt of his talent for organising.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 the Russian infantry comprised 6 regiments of Imperial Guards,\r\n14 of Grenadiers, 50 of light infantry (Chasseurs), and 96 of the line.\r\nEach regiment consisted of 3 4-company battalions with an establishment\r\nof 764 officers and men per battalion in the Guards, and 738 in the\r\nline. As a fact, only the Guard regiments were able to complete 3\r\nfield battalions. The strengths of the line regiments were so low\r\nthat Barclay could only complete 2 battalions of each regiment at the\r\nexpense of the third. One company of the third battalion was also\r\ncompleted by drafts from the other three, and these companies combined\r\nin threes or fours to form battalions of “combined grenadiers.” There\r\nthen remained to each regiment a weak battalion of three depleted\r\ncompanies. These were collected at various strategic centres as\r\n“Reserve Divisions,” and Barclay hoped to complete them with recruits.\r\nHe designed the formation of thirty-six depôts at suitable points, at\r\nwhich new levies were to be trained into additional battalions and\r\nsquadrons for the infantry and cavalry regiments. In this respect,\r\nhowever, there was not enough time for his judicious arrangements to\r\nhave much effect. In practice Russia was able to do little more than\r\nmaintain her field army at something like war strength. The third\r\nbattalions, reserves and new levies were chiefly absorbed in feeding\r\nthe fighting line.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the troops were by 1812 armed with a musket\r\nof new model, about equal to that with which the French and British\r\ninfantry were furnished, but many still carried the older and clumsier\r\nweapon which had been employed in 1807. The bullet was rather heavier\r\nthan that of the French infantry musket; but, judging from the fact\r\nthat the Russians usually appear to have had a higher proportion of\r\nkilled to wounded than their adversaries, it is probable that the\r\npowder was often inferior.\r\n\r\nThe Russian cavalry included 6 Guard regiments--2 of Cuirassiers, 1 of\r\nDragoons, 1 of Hussars, 1 of Uhlans (Lancers) and 1 of Cossacks--each\r\nof 4 field squadrons and 1 depôt squadron. The Cossack regiment\r\nincluded a detachment of Orenburg Cossacks, and apparently had 5 or 6\r\nfield squadrons. The line cavalry comprised 8 regiments of Cuirassiers,\r\n36 of Dragoons, each of 4 field squadrons and the depôt; 11 of\r\nHussars and 5 of Uhlans, each with 8 field and 2 depôt squadrons. The\r\nestablishment of a Guard squadron was 159 officers and men, that of a\r\nline squadron 151. The cavalry was well and adequately mounted, much\r\nbetter so than that of Napoleon. The men were less well trained than\r\ntheir opponents, but, belonging to a country in which there is a horse\r\nto every five or six human beings, were probably good horse masters.\r\nHay was the usual forage, and, to the surprise of Clausewitz, the\r\nhorses throve upon it. Accurate details of armament I have been unable\r\nto procure, except that the line Cuirassiers were only protected on the\r\nbreast. Helmets and cuirasses were painted black, not polished--a very\r\nsensible and labour-saving device.\r\n\r\nThe gradual inclusion in Russia of nomadic peoples and of the old\r\nborder moss-trooping or Cossack (really _Kazak_=freebooter) settlements\r\nenabled the Government to supplement its forces by swarms of irregular\r\nhorsemen. Besides the Cossacks these were Crimean Tartars, Kalmuks and\r\nBashkirs--the latter still clothed in chain mail and armed with the\r\nbow! In June there were perhaps 15,000 of them on the western frontier.\r\nTheir numbers later increased to 30,000 or more. Their reputation\r\nrests largely upon the dread with which they inspired the demoralised\r\nNapoleonic army during its retreat. In the field they could not contend\r\nwith regulars, and even during the retreat could never achieve anything\r\nagainst such of the French infantry as kept its ranks. For guerilla\r\noperations and for harassing the retreat they were invaluable.\r\n\r\nIn artillery Russian armies have usually been very strong. The\r\ninefficiency of the mediæval Muscovite levies of horse and foot led\r\nearly to a remarkable and precocious development of the artillery arm.\r\nPeter the Great in his reorganisation paid special attention to it, and\r\nhis crowning victory at Poltava was very largely due to his excellent\r\nartillery. After Peter’s reign his policy was continued, and Russia\r\nowed many victories to the masses of well-served guns which accompanied\r\nher armies.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 the Russian artillery of the line comprised 44 heavy, 58 light\r\nand 22 horse-artillery batteries organised in 27 foot and 10 reserve\r\nbrigades, besides single horse artillery batteries attached to the\r\ncavalry. There were also 29 depôt companies. The numbers of gunners and\r\ndrivers varied from an average of 240 for the heavy batteries to 160\r\nfor light artillery companies. They were each armed with 12 guns and\r\nhowitzers. Cossacks had their own horse batteries.\r\n\r\nThe artillery of the Guard comprised 2 heavy and 2 light batteries,\r\neach of 16 guns and howitzers, and 2 horse artillery batteries of 8,\r\nwith establishments in proportion.\r\n\r\nThe armament consisted of 18-pounder (1/2-_púd_) howitzers and\r\n12-pounder guns for the heavy batteries, 9-pounder howitzers and\r\n6-pounder guns for the light artillery, and 6-pounders for the horse\r\nbatteries. The heavy ammunition waggons customary in other European\r\narmies were not employed in Russia, their place being taken by a larger\r\nnumber of light vehicles. The quality of the material appears generally\r\nto have been excellent, though Sir R. Wilson and General Kutaïsov\r\nrecommended various improvements; and the draft horses were very\r\nnumerous and good. The Russian artillery continually performed feats of\r\ntransport that speak volumes for its high quality, and the number of\r\npieces abandoned or captured was extraordinarily small.\r\n\r\nThe technical troops were few in number and lacking both in scientific\r\nofficers and training. The medical department, though far better than\r\nin 1807, when it was practically non-existent, was still terribly\r\ninadequate and ill equipped, and trained physicians and surgeons were\r\nvery few.\r\n\r\nThere were 32 garrison regiments, 1 Guard garrison battalion, garrison\r\nartillery, and pensioners.\r\n\r\nA detailed statement of the Russian forces is given in Appendix C, but\r\nof course all of these were not available. Immediately disposable to\r\nmeet the invasion there were:--\r\n\r\nFirst Line\r\n\r\n                                    About\r\n First Army of the West            126,000\r\n Second  ”          ”               40,000\r\n Third   ”          ”               45,000\r\n                                  -------  211,000\r\n\r\nSecond Line\r\n\r\n                                    About\r\n 27th Infantry Division              7,500\r\n Reserve Troops and Riga Garrison   37,500\r\n                                    ------  45,000\r\n                                          --------\r\n                Total                      256,000\r\n\r\nTo reinforce the fighting line there were brought up during the\r\ncampaign--\r\n\r\n                                   About\r\n From Finland                       14,000\r\n   ”  the Turkish frontier          44,000\r\n   ”  the Crimea                     5,000\r\n Militia, Recruits, Cossacks, etc.  90,000\r\n                                   ------  153,000\r\n                                          --------\r\n     Total actually employed               409,000\r\n                                          --------\r\n\r\nThe last item can only be a very rough estimate. It is, however,\r\ncertain that the large figures given in some authorities bear no\r\nproportion to the numbers of reinforcements which actually reached the\r\nfront. It is of course obvious that the entire armed strength of Russia\r\ncannot be reckoned as opposed to Napoleon. The Asiatic, Caucasian and\r\nCrimea troops could at best only furnish small detachments.\r\n\r\nThe First and Second Armies had received at the hands of Barclay a\r\nfairly complete army-corps organisation, each corps containing two\r\ninfantry divisions, a brigade or division of cavalry, and two brigades\r\nof artillery, with a battery of horse artillery attached to the\r\ncavalry. The Third Army and the Army of the Danube were still organised\r\nin the main on the old system of mixed divisions.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the Russian soldier have never varied. He\r\nwas and is endowed with remarkable endurance and courage, but is\r\ncomparatively unintelligent. In 1812 illiteracy was practically\r\nuniversal.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of service were bad. The period was twenty-five years,\r\nand brutal methods were often necessary to compel the recruits to leave\r\nthe homes which they would probably never see again. Life in the ranks\r\nwas hard, and only the fact that it was probably no harder than the\r\nexistence of the average peasant could have rendered it endurable.\r\nThe men were well clothed, for obvious reasons; but they were in\r\ngeneral ill-fed, ill-lodged, ill-cared-for, and practically unpaid.\r\nThe methods of maintaining discipline were brutal, and if in theory\r\nmilitary service meant emancipation from serfdom, in practice the men\r\nwere treated as slaves. It is all to their honour that they made and\r\nmake such good soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe great characteristic of Russian troops is their extraordinary\r\nsolidity and imperturbability under the most terrible punishment. A\r\nRussian army hardly ever dissolves under the influence of defeat;\r\nit must literally be battered to pieces. A good example of this was\r\nafforded at Zorndorf in 1758, when Frederick the Great gained a Cadmean\r\nsuccess over a largely raw, badly trained and equipped, and ill-led\r\nRussian army not greatly superior in number to his own. He nearly\r\ndestroyed both wings of the Russian host, but the centre stood firm,\r\nrallied the survivors, fought doggedly until nightfall, and lumbered\r\ndefiantly away with some show of equality. The campaign of 1812 was to\r\nafford further proof of these characteristics.\r\n\r\nThere is a tendency to regard the Russian soldiers as generally large\r\nmen, but there is abundant evidence that this was not the case. An\r\nEnglish observer, writing about 1854, describes them as usually\r\nundersized, but they were doubtless hardy enough. The Guards were\r\npicked men. The cavalry, artillery, light infantry and grenadiers\r\nabsorbed the best of the remaining recruits; the ordinary line\r\nregiments, with very inadequate means, had to assimilate and train the\r\npoorest of the available material.\r\n\r\nThe officers, as a class, were not capable of adequately training the\r\nfine material at their disposal. There were honourable exceptions, but\r\nat his best the Russian regimental officer was hardly the equal of\r\nhis opponent of corresponding rank, though often, perhaps, a better\r\nlinguist and a finer social figure. The Guards, as a whole, obtained\r\nthe best officers, and after them the pick went to the cavalry and\r\nartillery, while the line infantry regiments were often very badly\r\noff. The ordinary battalion and company leaders frequently lacked all\r\nbut the most elementary military instruction. Appointment and promotion\r\nwere too often due to Court favour, female influence or corruption.\r\nThe officers were, as a class, indolent. Too often they were not at\r\nthe head of their men; their private carriages or sledges swelled the\r\ntrains to enormous proportions, while the fighting line was weakened by\r\nthe numbers of men detailed for their service. Gambling and drunkenness\r\nwere very prevalent, and personal cowardice by no means uncommon, as\r\nDuke Eugen of Württemberg and Löwenstern testify. It is fair to add\r\nthat defects such as these existed more or less in all armies of the\r\nperiod, but the Russian army has always been badly or inadequately\r\nofficered.\r\n\r\nIn the higher ranks the conditions were not more satisfactory. There\r\nwas a superabundance of general officers, but their quality often left\r\nmuch to be desired, and appointments were frequently due to other\r\ncauses than military efficiency. This was, it is true, not especially\r\nthe case in 1812. Alexander, presumably with the assistance of Barclay\r\nde Tolly, seems to have made a very fair choice of corps commanders,\r\nand several of the divisional leaders later acquired a well-deserved\r\nrenown.\r\n\r\nThe foreign officers were a most important element. Germany furnished\r\nthe largest contingent, but there were many French _émigrés_, as\r\nthe Duc de Richelieu, Langeron, and St. Priest, and at least one\r\nItalian, the Marquis Paulucci. It may fairly be said of them that\r\ntheir general intellectual and scientific level was higher than that\r\nof the native officers. The latter were naturally bitterly jealous;\r\nand the foreigners rarely receive justice at the hands of popular\r\nRussian writers. It is humiliating to find even Tolstoï stooping to\r\nperpetuate these jealousies and employing the term “German” in an\r\nobviously contemptuous sense. Many of these foreigners did excellent\r\nwork for Russia in 1812--though it is true that Phull, perhaps the\r\nmost prominent of them, was an unpractical dreamer.\r\n\r\nMikhail Bogdanovich, Baron Barclay de Tolly, Minister of War and\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the First Army of the West at the outbreak of\r\nhostilities, was himself in some sense a foreigner, and seems to have\r\nbeen regarded as one, much to his misfortune, by the ultra-Russian\r\nofficers. He was a Livonian by birth, and ultimately of Scottish\r\nextraction, being descended from a member of the family of Barclay of\r\nTowie, who had settled in Livonia in the seventeenth century. In 1812\r\nGeneral Barclay de Tolly was fifty-one years of age. His rise in the\r\narmy had at first been very slow, owing to his unassuming character and\r\nto lack of influence; but his skill and courage as a divisional leader\r\nin 1807 and 1809, especially displayed in his march across the frozen\r\nBaltic in the latter year, had brought him to the front rank in the\r\nRussian councils. His reorganisation of the Russian army in 1810-12\r\nwill probably constitute his best title to fame. The published Russian\r\ndocuments bear emphatic witness to his industry, energy, and scientific\r\nspirit. His deficiencies in high command are to be attributed partly\r\nto inexperience in handling large masses of troops--an inexperience\r\nwhich he shared with all but a very few contemporary leaders. He was\r\noverburdened with work, being War Minister as well as general, and was\r\nconstantly harassed by the insubordination, sometimes verging upon\r\nmutiny, of his assistants. His personal character stands very high.\r\nPatriotism and devotion to duty were to him a religion; and he was one\r\nof the few men in Russia who rose above narrowly patriotic views. His\r\nscorn of personal profit and ease do him the highest honour, since they\r\nwere shared by few indeed of the men about him. Alexander’s trust in\r\nhim never seems really to have faltered. The dreamy, romantic, crowned\r\nknight-errant and the simple, devoted soldier of his country had indeed\r\nmuch in common. Russia has had few sons to compare with Barclay de\r\nTolly; and it is not to her credit that his worth has been so little\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIELD-MARSHAL PRINCE BARCLAY DE TOLLY\r\n\r\nGeneral, War Minister, and Commander of the First Army of the West in\r\n1812]\r\n\r\nGeneral Prince Peter Ivanovich Bagration, commander of the Second\r\nArmy of the West, was a man of different stamp. He was descended\r\nfrom the Armenian royal line of the Bagratidae; and to his exalted\r\nrank his rapid rise in the service was largely due. Though only\r\nborn in 1765, he was a major-general in 1795. At the same time\r\nBagration’s abilities were considerable enough to have ensured his\r\nrise under any circumstances. Suvórov had a high opinion of him; and\r\nthe great leader’s judgment cannot be lightly set aside. Bagration\r\nwas essentially a fighter: his tactics were usually influenced by\r\nhis combative instincts; and his excitable temperament rendered\r\nhim reckless of his person. His impatient temper rendered him an\r\nintractable colleague for the calm and methodical Barclay; and the\r\nlatter’s courtesy and deference to the senior who had come under his\r\norders did not always relieve their strained relations. On the whole,\r\nit would seem that Bagration possessed better strategic insight than\r\nhis comrade; but his tactical ideas were not always happy. Having\r\nregard to his impetuosity, it was, perhaps, fortunate for Russia\r\nthat he was not, as his admirers wished, placed in supreme command.\r\nBut in pressing the French retreat his fiery energy would have been\r\ninvaluable; and from this point of view his death was a national\r\ndisaster. It is but due to his memory to say that he really appears\r\nto have been a man of too high and noble a character to condescend\r\nto wilful insubordination or intrigue; his intractability was the\r\noutcome of temporary ill-temper, as were his occasional unjust remarks\r\nconcerning Barclay. Towards the end of their association relations\r\nbetween the two chiefs improved; and, on one occasion at least\r\nBagration openly testified to his regard for Barclay.\r\n\r\nGeneral Count Alexander Petrovich Tormazov, the commander of the Third\r\nArmy of the West, does not appear to have been a man of any exceptional\r\nability. His early successes were due to numerical superiority; but he\r\nthen unduly dispersed his forces, and was in his turn overwhelmed. At\r\nGorodeczna he would probably have been destroyed but for the methodical\r\nslowness of his opponents.\r\n\r\nGeneral Prince Mikhail Hilarionovich Golénischev-Kutuzov, who in August\r\nbecame Commander-in-Chief of all the Russian armies in the field, was\r\na veteran of sixty-seven years, of which fifty-two had been spent in\r\narms. He was certainly a man of ability, both political and military;\r\nand his practical experience of war was great, though largely acquired\r\nin service against Polish _guerrillas_ and Turkish irregulars. Though\r\nhe had been nominal Commander-in-Chief at Austerlitz, his reputation\r\nhad scarcely suffered; for it was well known that he had exercised\r\npractically no authority, which had been usurped by the young Tzar and\r\nhis confidants. That he could take advantage of his opponents’ blunders\r\nhad been demonstrated at Dürrenstein in 1805, and on the Danube in\r\n1811. But in 1812 Kutuzov was too old for the emergency; and wounds\r\nand infirmity had diminished his bodily activity. Even in the Turkish\r\nwar this had been noticeable. As an ultra-Russian he was able to\r\ncommand more loyal support than Barclay. His conduct of the battle of\r\nBorodino was at least energetic, and his subsequent strategy sound; but\r\nduring the French retreat his lack of enterprise was evident. His last\r\ncampaign made him Field-Marshal and Prince of Smolensk, but can hardly\r\nbe said to have enhanced his reputation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIELD-MARSHAL PRINCE GOLÉNISCHEV-KUTUZOV\r\n\r\nCommander-in-chief of the Russian Armies in 1812]\r\n\r\nGeneral Baron Levin Bennigsen, the stout antagonist of Napoleon in\r\n1806-1807, was for a time Kutuzov’s principal assistant; but the two\r\ndid not work well together, and eventually Bennigsen was retired.\r\nBennigsen, a Hanoverian soldier of fortune, was as old as Kutuzov,\r\nbut much more energetic. He appears to have been a selfish and jealous,\r\nbut able, man, and in the following year once more did Russia good\r\nservice. Barclay, according to Löwenstern, said of him, that despite\r\nhis ability, he was a “veritable pest” to the army, owing to his\r\negoism and envy; and this view is certainly borne out by a perusal of\r\nBennigsen’s unreliable and self-laudatory memoirs.\r\n\r\nGeneral Matvei Ivanovich Platov, Ataman of the Cossacks of the Don, is\r\nprobably better known to British readers than any of his colleagues. He\r\nwas a burly, genial officer, uniting to considerable military talents\r\nthe daring and good-humour which were even more important in the eyes\r\nof his wild followers. He was an ideal leader of irregulars; his\r\nceaseless activity and energy will presently be more apparent.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Pavel Vasilievich Chichagov, Commander-in-Chief of the Army\r\nof the Danube, is a somewhat remarkable figure in Russian history. He\r\nperhaps owed some of his characteristics to his frequent association\r\nwith Englishmen. He seems to have been somewhat impetuous and\r\nexcitable; and certainly possessed a very independent temper, not\r\nhesitating to speak his mind to his despotic master. A seaman and\r\ndiplomatist, placed in command of a land army at a great crisis, it\r\nwould not have been strange had he failed badly, but this was far from\r\nbeing the case. Once clear of the Turkish embroglio he brought his army\r\nto the front with all speed; and though, as a general, too slow, he\r\ncarried out his operations with a steady pertinacity, refusing to be\r\ndiverted by contradictory orders. For Napoleon’s escape at the Berezina\r\nhe was only very partially responsible; but the entire blame was laid\r\nupon him by the hasty injustice of his countrymen, and his career\r\nended in voluntary exile many years later. It is not pleasant to find\r\nhis name still rancorously assailed. The Tzar Alexander II was of a\r\ndifferent opinion; one of the first ships of the Russian ironclad navy\r\nwas named _Chichagov_.\r\n\r\nOf the advisers who surrounded and influenced--not always for his\r\ngood--the Tzar, the most prominent was the Prussian Phull. He had\r\noccupied an important position on the Prussian staff in the fatal\r\nyear 1806, a fact which should surely have warned Alexander against\r\nhis counsels. Certainly none but the Tzar had any confidence in him,\r\nand his utter lack of real military capacity was shown in the famous\r\nproject of the camp at Drissa.\r\n\r\nOf the staff-officers the most notable were Major-General Alexei\r\nPetrovich Yermólov and Colonel Baron Charles Toll. The former was an\r\nextraordinary personality, who seems to have retained more barbarian\r\ncharacteristics than any European military leader of modern times.\r\nHe was a man of great courage, considerable ability, and remarkable\r\nwill-power; but of a savage and unstable disposition. He could be\r\nguilty of gross cruelty to prisoners of war, and later, as Viceroy of\r\nthe Caucasus, relied, as he admitted with cynical frankness, upon a\r\npolicy of indiscriminate massacre. Yet he was a kind and considerate\r\ncommander, beloved by his troops, and not ungenerous in his treatment\r\nof subordinates. This treacherous side of his character would induce\r\nhim to intrigue against a rival, with whom he would then suddenly\r\nbecome reconciled on some impulse of generosity. He intrigued against\r\nBarclay, but wept bitterly when that ill-used chief left the army. It\r\nmay have been hypocrisy, as Löwenstern says; but it really has more\r\nresemblance to one of those impulses which civilised men can hardly\r\nunderstand, but which are characteristic of barbaric natures, such as\r\nYermólov’s. Yermólov’s policy of massacre failed to pacify Caucasia,\r\nand his successor Paskievich declared it to have been a gross blunder.\r\nNevertheless, Yermólov has continued to this day to be the subject\r\nof somewhat indiscriminate eulogy. It is perhaps better to take the\r\nopinion of men who knew him. Barclay’s was terse and to the point: “An\r\nable man, but false and intriguing.” Alexander’s was pithy: “His heart\r\nis as black as his boot.” Clausewitz, who was little associated with\r\nhim, admitted his ability.\r\n\r\nToll was a scientific soldier of considerable attainments, and played a\r\ndistinguished part during the years 1812-1815.\r\n\r\nOf the officers who, during the campaign, commanded detachments or army\r\ncorps several were men of real distinction.\r\n\r\nGeneral Mikhail Andreïevich Miloradovich--“the Russian Murat”--was\r\nin charge of the advance-guard which pressed the French retreat. The\r\nRussian documents show that he was hardly so much the mere swordsman\r\nas Tolstoï would make him. Both in 1812 and 1813 Miloradovich\r\ndistinguished himself greatly, showing himself to be as admirable in\r\nrear-guard command as he was in the leading of the pursuit.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General Count Peter Wittgenstein, the German commander of\r\nthe 1st Army Corps, gained considerable renown by his independent\r\noperations against Napoleon’s left wing. In high command he always\r\nfailed; but as a corps commander he was equal to most of the French\r\nmarshals, and, though frequently rash and inconsiderate, was never\r\nlacking in stubbornness and energy.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dmitri Sergeievich Dokhturov, commanding the 6th Corps, had\r\nserved with distinction as a divisional leader in 1805, 1806 and\r\n1807; and reaped fresh laurels in 1812. His conduct before and during\r\nthe battle of Maloyaroslavetz reflected the highest credit upon him,\r\nand may be said in effect to have sealed the fate of the retreating\r\nNapoleonic host.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General Nikolai Nikolaievich Raievski, the commander of\r\nthe 7th Corps, gained a reputation little inferior to that earned by\r\nDokhturov. During the critical days of August 14-16, when Napoleon\r\nwas executing his famous flank march on Smolensk, Raievski’s ready\r\nacceptance of responsibility and fine resolution ensured the defence\r\nof the city, and gave Barclay and Bagration time to concentrate. His\r\naction undoubtedly saved the Russians from severe defeat, if not,\r\nindeed, from crushing and irretrievable disaster.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General von der Osten-Sacken, commanding the reserves of\r\nthe Third Army, was detailed by Admiral Chichagov to guard his rear\r\nagainst Schwarzenberg in November, while he himself marched to hold the\r\ncrossings of the Berezina. He executed his task with unfailing courage\r\nand energy, though opposed to greatly superior numbers. Though an\r\nelderly man, his fighting energy was great. In the two following years\r\nhe added to his reputation as a dauntless and hard-fighting commander.\r\n\r\nNone of the other Russian corps commanders was accorded the opportunity\r\nof rendering such eminent service as these three; but none, whatever\r\nhis other defects, showed himself deficient at need in that\r\nstubbornness which was probably the most necessary of all qualities\r\nwhen opposed to Napoleon.\r\n\r\nNor can any serious fault be found with the majority of the divisional\r\ncommanders. Conspicuous among them were Konovnitzin, Neverovski, and\r\nthe young Prince Eugen of Württemberg, who next year gained a great\r\nreputation as chief of the 2nd Corps. Among those who later rose\r\nto the highest rank may be mentioned Voronzov, a brave, capable,\r\nand altogether estimable man, the hero of the terrific struggle on\r\nthe plateau of Craonne in 1814, and thirty years later Viceroy of\r\nthe Caucasus. Also, in command of one of Raievski’s divisions was a\r\ndifficult-tempered, vain, and jealous young major-general, who in\r\nafter years was to achieve a European renown--Paskievich, presently to\r\nbe Field-Marshal Paskievich of Erivan and Prince of Warsaw. Another\r\nprominent figure was that of the youthful Major-General Count Kutaïsov,\r\nwho commanded the artillery of Barclay’s army. Though only twenty-eight\r\nyears of age, he does not appear to have been unfitted for his post;\r\nall who came in contact with him bear witness to his tireless energy.\r\nCertainly the Russian losses in artillery were very slight, and to\r\nKutaïsov must part at least of the credit be given. He ended his\r\nbrief and brilliant career on the field of Borodino while leading a\r\nsuccessful counter-attack.\r\n\r\nOf the Russian army as a whole it is to be said that there were\r\ntoo many generals entitled by their rank to high command, and whom\r\nit was deemed necessary to placate by giving them commands. At\r\nBorodino, besides the general officers on the staffs of Barclay and\r\nBagration, Bennigsen was present as Chief-of-Staff of all the Russian\r\narmies; Konovnitzin was “general of service,” and there were others.\r\nMiloradovich commanded two army corps under Barclay, and General\r\nGorchakov was also on the field in a somewhat undefined capacity--all\r\nthese in addition to the Commander-in-Chief and the leaders of the two\r\narmies. Most of them were useless on the field, for Barclay, Bagration,\r\nand Kutuzov naturally sent orders direct to the corps and divisional\r\ncommanders. In 1813 matters were even worse. In order to employ as many\r\nas possible of the ambitious general officers a practice was adopted\r\nof combining corps in pairs. In this fashion a force of about 35,000\r\nmen was burdened with more than thirty generals and three distinct\r\nstaffs! In 1812 the confusion at head-quarters, owing to the presence\r\nof unattached generals or relatives of the Tzar, was often great, and\r\nthat disaster did not ensue was more than once due to something like\r\nsheer good fortune. Alexander also committed what might have been a\r\nfatal error in not giving one general precedence over another when\r\nacting together. Barclay and Bagration often found it hard to agree;\r\nand though Chichagov and Tormazov, and, apparently, Wittgenstein and\r\nSteingell, succeeded in working together, it was fortunate that trouble\r\ndid not arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN. OPERATIONS FROM KOVNO TO VITEBSK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Russian frontier in 1812, from the Black Sea to where the River Bug\r\nissues from Galicia, was practically as it is to-day. The ten Polish\r\nGovernments, however, then formed the greater part of the Grand Duchy\r\nof Warsaw: the border therefore stopped short at the Bug and the lower\r\nNiemen below Grodno. The Niemen, rising near the city of Minsk, flows\r\nroughly westward for about 150 miles to Grodno, thence about 80 miles\r\nnorthward to Kovno, and then some 110 miles westward into the Kurisches\r\nHaff. From Grodno to Kovno the channel is deeply sunk and difficult to\r\ncross. There were in 1812 bridges at Grodno and Tilsit; but at Kovno\r\nthe Königsberg-Vilna high-road was served only by a ferry. For the last\r\n60 miles of its course the Niemen is in Prussian territory. It thus\r\nbecame extremely important for Napoleon as soon as he had occupied its\r\nright bank. He had already collected a large flotilla of gunboats and\r\nbarges, under Rear-Admiral Baste, in the ports of the Frisches and\r\nKurisches Haffs, and was able therefore to bring immense quantities of\r\nsupplies from his advanced depôts to Kovno and thence to Vilna.\r\n\r\nFor about 100 miles south-westward from Grodno there was no natural\r\nfrontier; thence to the Austrian border it was formed by the Bug,\r\nwhich, issuing from Galicia below the town of Sokal, flows northward\r\nfor some 110 miles to Brest-Litovsk, and then north-westward for 70\r\nmiles more to what was in 1812 the Polish border. For nearly 100 miles\r\nnear Brest-Litovsk the Pinsk Marshes close in upon the river. The\r\nAustro-Russian border need not be considered, for it was neutralised;\r\nSchwarzenberg operated only as an auxiliary, in Poland. Trade continued\r\nas usual, and when Admiral Chichagov’s army passed close along the\r\nfrontier on its way to attack Schwarzenberg it was not molested by\r\nRussia’s nominal enemies.\r\n\r\nThe first provinces on the right bank of the Niemen entered by the\r\n_Grand Armée_ were Courland to the north and the various districts\r\nwhich had once formed the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to the southward.\r\nLithuania was and is a region of woods and marshy plain land, broken\r\nin places, and intersected in every direction by streams flowing in\r\ndeeply sunken channels. In the south there stretched inland from the\r\nBug the famous marshes of Pinsk, one of the largest tracts of fenland\r\nin the world, extending as it does for some 300 miles east and west, by\r\nover 100 north and south. The soil, even when not actually swampy, was\r\ngenerally soft, and there were hardly any good roads. Towns were few;\r\nthe population was sparse and wretchedly poor.\r\n\r\nAt distances varying from about 120 to over 300 miles eastward of the\r\nBug and Niemen a second natural line is formed by the Düna and the\r\nDnieper. The Düna rises near the Volga, flows roughly south-west to\r\nVitebsk, there turns west-north-west and runs for nearly 300 miles to\r\nthe Baltic at Riga. Above Vitebsk it is fairly often fordable during\r\nthe summer heats. In 1812 it was bridged at Vitebsk and Dünaburg,\r\nhalf-way to Riga, but, since the left bank is generally higher than the\r\nright between these places, the river does not afford a good line of\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nFrom the Düna at Vitebsk southward to the Dnieper at Orsha is a gap\r\nof about 45 miles. At Orsha the Dnieper, one of the great rivers of\r\nEurope, turns to the southward, to flow for 800 miles into the Black\r\nSea. Seventy miles above Orsha is Smolensk, where in 1812 there was a\r\nbridge. At Mohilev, 50 miles below Orsha, there was another. The river\r\nis rarely fordable even during the summer. Its tributary the Berezina,\r\nwhich was a most important strategic feature in the campaign, flows\r\ntowards it on the east at an acute angle for 200 miles, joining at a\r\npoint nearly due east of Warsaw and west of Orel. In 1812 there were\r\nbridges at Borisov and Bobruisk, but in general the river is fordable\r\nin summer. The right bank is usually higher than the left.\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s advanced bases were the places on the Vistula, especially\r\nDanzig and Warsaw--though Danzig was infinitely the most important. The\r\nroad from Danzig to the frontier divided at Wehlau; the left branch\r\ngoing by Tilsit through Courland to Mitau and Riga, and thence to\r\nSt. Petersburg; the right by Insterburg and Gumbinnen to the Niemen\r\nat Kovno, thence by Vilna, Ochmiana, Minsk, Borisov and Orsha, to\r\nSmolensk. From Mitau and Riga two roads converged on Jakobstädt, and\r\nthen passed along the right bank of the Düna, by Dünaburg, Drissa,\r\nDesna and Polotsk, to Vitebsk, whence two or three roads led to\r\nSmolensk. From Polotsk and Smolensk ran roads north-westward to St.\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\nFrom Vilna a road led by Sventsiani and Glubokoie to Desna and Polotsk.\r\nFrom near Sventsiani a branch went to Dünaburg, and from Glubokoie\r\nanother fork led by Lepel and Bechenkowiczi to Vitebsk. Cross-roads\r\nconnected Vitebsk with Orsha, and Lepel with the Smolensk-Minsk\r\nroad, half-way from Orsha to Bobr. From Orsha the main road to Kiev\r\nran down the right bank of the Dnieper through Mohilev and Staroi\r\nBykhov. From Bobr another road led to Bobruisk and thence into the\r\nOrsha-Mohilev-Kiev highway. A third road went from Bobruisk to Minsk by\r\nway of Igumen.\r\n\r\nThe road eastward from Warsaw forked some 30 miles out, separating into\r\ntwo branches, which united again at Novi Svergen, 250 miles farther\r\non. The southern branch proceeded by Brest-Litovsk, Slonim and Nesvizh;\r\nthe northern one passed by Bielsk, Bielostok, Grodno and Novogrodek.\r\nFrom Novi Svergen the road ran nearly north-eastward to Minsk, about\r\n60 miles farther on. From Brest-Litovsk a road branched off to Lutsk,\r\nthrough the Pinsk Marshes. At Kobrin, some 30 miles farther on, a road\r\npierced the marshes eastward, turning to the right about 30 miles short\r\nof Pinsk, and eventually coming out in the direction of Lutsk and\r\nOstrog. A branch connected Pinsk with this road, and from Pinsk another\r\nhighway led through the fens northward to Nesvizh. From Slonim a road\r\nled northward to Vilna, intersecting the Grodno road about a third of\r\nthe way out, and another cross-road connected the two Warsaw roads,\r\neast of Grodno, by way of Volkovisk. Finally a road led from Nesvizh by\r\nSlutsk to Bobruisk, and from the latter place another passed through\r\nthe eastern end of the Pinsk fens by Mozyr-on-Pripet to Kiev. There\r\nwere, of course, many minor roads or tracks, but these were practically\r\nall that could be used for military purposes, and most of them were\r\ninferior. From Smolensk eastward the road system became, so far as the\r\ncampaign was concerned, very simple, consisting merely of a single\r\ntrunk leading to Moscow.\r\n\r\nRussian high-roads are commonly of considerable breadth, so that it was\r\npossible for vehicles to move upon them several abreast. Both armies,\r\nhowever, were so encumbered by immense trains that their columns\r\ncovered enormous lengths of road.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Moscow, Warsaw and Riga, there were no large\r\ntowns, in the modern sense of the word, within the theatre of war,\r\nand even Riga can scarcely be regarded as one. Moscow had somewhat\r\nover 200,000 inhabitants, Warsaw about half as many. Vilna, Grodno,\r\nMinsk, Vitebsk and Smolensk had each from 20,000 to 30,000 inhabitants;\r\nKovno, Dünaburg, Mitau, Brest-Litovsk, Bielostok, Mohilev and Bobruisk\r\nperhaps from 15,000 to 20,000; Polotsk possibly 15,000. Borisov,\r\nOrsha, Bobr, Smorgoni and many other places described as towns were\r\nmerely villages--not often large villages, according to modern ideas.\r\nFrom Moscow to Smolensk, a distance of over 250 English miles, there\r\nwere only three small towns,--Viasma, Gzhatsk and Dorogobuzh--and the\r\nlargest of these had but about 5000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nWhile Napoleon was inspecting his depôts, completing the organisation\r\nof his water transport, and setting in train the formation and pushing\r\nto the front of his numerous reserve forces, the Grand Army, now\r\npractically secure from Russian attack, was moving up to the Niemen.\r\nBy the 12th of June the advance-guard of the 10th Corps was at Tilsit,\r\nand the Imperial Guard and five army corps, besides three corps of\r\nthe cavalry reserves, were steadily advancing behind towards the line\r\nof the Niemen between Tilsit and Kovno. The 5th and 8th Corps were in\r\nadvance of Warsaw, and the 7th a little way in rear of it. The Emperor\r\nstill expected that Bagration would invade the Grand Duchy, for on\r\nJune 10th he wrote to Eugène on that hypothesis. He also appears to\r\nhave anticipated that Bagration’s advance would be supported by at\r\nleast a part of Barclay’s army. At all events he speaks of a possible\r\nattack upon Eugène, which indicates that he looked for something like a\r\ngeneral encounter along his whole front.\r\n\r\nHe explained to Eugène that his echelon formation, with the left in\r\nadvance, would enable him to take in flank the attack of the Russians\r\ndirected against his right or centre. If Jerome were attacked, Eugène\r\nwith the 4th and 6th Corps would be able to fall on the flank of the\r\nhostile columns, while if Eugène himself were assailed he could be\r\nsupported at need by the whole left wing. All this certainly appears to\r\npoint to the idea of a general Russian advance. Whether the somewhat\r\ncomplicated manoeuvres anticipated by the Emperor took sufficiently\r\ninto account the inexperience of Eugène and Jerome, and the frightful\r\nPolish tracks by which they would be obliged to move, may be doubted.\r\nMoreover, it is clear that their successful execution depended upon the\r\nRussian generals being so obliging as to play into Napoleon’s hands.\r\nThe armies, it must be remembered, were not yet in touch, and the\r\nRussians had perfect freedom to manoeuvre at will.\r\n\r\nBy June 18th Napoleon had about 320,000 men (Imperial Guard, 1st, 2nd,\r\n3rd, 4th, 6th and 10th _Corps d’Armée_, and 1st, 2nd and 3rd Reserve\r\nCavalry Corps) concentrated on a front of about 130 miles from Tilsit\r\nsouth-westward to the Prusso-Polish frontier. Thence to Warsaw stood\r\nthe 5th, 7th and 8th Corps and the 4th Cavalry Corps--80,000 men on a\r\nline of 80 miles. Finally, the Austrians, 34,000 strong, constituted\r\nthe detached right flank-guard, marching from Zamosc by Lublin on Warsaw.\r\n\r\nTotal 434,000 combatants, 1076 guns.\r\n\r\nThe Russians were cantoned as follows: The First Army was strategically\r\ndisposed in a main body, a reserve, and two semi-independent wings. The\r\n1st Corps (Wittgenstein) constituted the right wing, about Rossieni,\r\nsome 100 miles north-west of Vilna, and nearly opposite to Napoleon’s\r\ndetached left flank-guard, under Macdonald, at Tilsit. About Lida,\r\n60 miles south of Vilna, on the road to Slonim, stood the 6th Corps\r\n(Dokhturov) and the 3rd Cavalry Corps (Pahlen II), forming the left\r\nwing, under Dokhturov. The 2nd Corps (Baggohufwudt), the 3rd (Tuchkov\r\nI) and the 4th (Shuvalov) were guarding the line of the Niemen above\r\nand below Kovno, on a front of about 60 miles. The 1st Cavalry Corps\r\n(Uvarov) was at Vilkomirz, 40 miles north-north-west of Vilna, and the\r\n2nd (Korff) at Smorgoni, nearly 50 miles on the road to Minsk. The 5th\r\nCorps (H.I.H. the Grand Duke Constantine) formed the general reserve\r\nat Sventsiani, about 45 miles north-east of Vilna. The “Flying Corps”\r\nof Cossacks under the Ataman Platov was pushed forward to the frontier\r\nabout Grodno, 60 miles west of Lida. The First Army, including Platov,\r\nnumbered some 126,000 men, including 19,000 regular cavalry and 584\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nOf the two army corps which composed the Second Army the 8th (Borozdin\r\nI) was at Volkovisk, 60 miles south-south-west of Lida, and the 7th\r\n(Raievski) at Novi Dvor, 20 miles farther south. The 4th Cavalry Corps\r\n(Sievers), and about 4000 Cossacks, under General Ilovaïski, connected\r\nthe two. The newly formed 27th Division (Neverovski) which was marching\r\nfrom Moscow to join Bagration, had not yet passed Minsk. Including it\r\nthe Second Army comprised about 47,000 men, including 7000 regular\r\ncavalry, and 168 guns.\r\n\r\nThe Third Army was widely dispersed and could not take the field for\r\nsome weeks. It numbered in all perhaps 45,000 men.\r\n\r\nThus, owing to various causes--divided counsels, imperfect\r\norganisation, bad roads and especially the lack of any real\r\ncommand-in-chief--the Russian forces were, almost up to the very\r\nmoment of hostile contact, in a state of dangerous dispersion. The\r\nsecret history of the months during which Alexander had been at Vilna\r\nwill probably never be accurately known. Dissension and intrigue were\r\nrampant in the Tzar’s personal _entourage_. Much valuable time was\r\nwasted in drafting and discussing plans of action, all impracticable,\r\nbecause based upon hypotheses which proved untenable. They all\r\nconsiderably underestimated Napoleon’s fighting strength, and appear\r\nto have assumed a concentration of the Russian forces about Vilna.\r\nThere was great disorder in the higher commands. Barclay was nominally\r\ncommander-in-chief, but Alexander frequently issued orders, through his\r\nadjutant, Prince Volkonski, over the head of the harassed War-Minister,\r\nwhile to make confusion worse confounded Phull, as Clausewitz\r\nexpresses it, “sometimes put in _his_ oar.” Contrary to the usually\r\naccepted belief, it appears that Barclay would have preferred to stand\r\nto fight, granted a favourable opportunity. The deciding factor in the\r\nsituation seems to have been that almost at the last moment the Russian\r\nstaff obtained better information as to the strength which Napoleon had\r\nwith him in Prussia.\r\n\r\nAt all events the party of prudence finally obtained the upper hand\r\nin the Tzar’s councils. The policy of retreating before the invader\r\nhad been so often discussed that there was nothing unexpected in the\r\nresolution which was adopted. It was determined to draw back the whole\r\nFirst Army at least as far as Sventsiani. All the corps commanders\r\nwere warned to be ready to retreat thither immediately upon receiving\r\norders, except Wittgenstein, who was given permission to anticipate\r\nthem if pressed by a rapid advance of Napoleon’s extreme left wing\r\nover the Niemen. Platov, it was vaguely supposed, would be able to\r\nthreaten Napoleon’s communications, and would be supported by Bagration\r\nfrom Volkovisk. Tormazov, with the Third Army, was to retreat on\r\nKiev if hard pressed; but, if not, was to leave General Sacken with\r\nhis incomplete division to observe the Austrian frontier, and with\r\nthe rest of his army to fall upon the right of the forces which were\r\nopposed to Bagration. General Okunev, in his commentaries upon the war,\r\nsuggests that Bagration and Tormazov should have effected a junction\r\nand advanced in force against Napoleon’s communications while he was\r\nengaged in front with Barclay. As, however, Napoleon could detach\r\n80,000 men, under Eugène, to support the 114,000 whom he already had\r\nin the Grand Duchy, Bagration, Tormazov and Platov would eventually be\r\noutnumbered by at least two to one; while Napoleon would still have\r\npossessed a double superiority of numbers over Barclay. In fact the\r\nRussians were so enormously outmatched at every point that retreat\r\nwas the only sensible strategy. Napoleon, it is true, assumed that\r\nthe Russians would stand to fight. This was partly, no doubt, due\r\nto mistaken but not unreasonable calculations as to their state of\r\npreparation, but also largely, it is to be feared, to the obstinate\r\noptimism which during his latter years became something like an acute\r\nmental disease with him. He had developed a fatal habit of believing\r\nthat his enemies would always play into his hands.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, still proceeding on the assumption that Bagration would\r\ninvade the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, while Barclay stood fast to oppose\r\nhis own advance upon Vilna, the French Emperor decided to operate the\r\npassage of the Niemen close to Kovno. Kovno lies at the confluence\r\nof the Vilia, the river of Vilna, with the Niemen, and was therefore\r\nadmirably adapted for the collection of stores by water from Danzig\r\nand Königsberg, and forwarding them to Vilna as soon as that place and\r\nthe surrounding country were in Napoleon’s power. In point of fact\r\nthe Vilia proved too sinuous and difficult to be of much utility,\r\nbut this could hardly be known at the time, and in any case did not\r\ngreatly affect the value of Kovno as a base. The forest of Pilwiski\r\nor Wilkowiski, extending over a considerable area on the bank of the\r\nriver opposite Kovno, furnished an excellent screen for Napoleon’s\r\noperations. Finally, by bridging the river and debouching rapidly in\r\nthe direction of Vilna, Barclay might be separated from his detached\r\nright wing under Wittgenstein. All this obviously assumed that the\r\nRussians would remain stationary.\r\n\r\nOn June 22nd Jerome was directed to be at Augustowo on the 25th. On\r\nthat day his three corps were extended along the Warsaw-Augustowo\r\nroad, and the head of the 5th Corps, which was leading, was nearly\r\n50 miles away. The 8th was still farther behind, and the 7th as yet\r\nin the neighbourhood of Warsaw, awaiting the Austrians, who were\r\nslowly advancing from Lublin. Napoleon was probably misinformed as\r\nto distances, and certainly had not taken into full consideration\r\nthe wretched Polish roads. He apparently calculated upon being able\r\nto throw his main body suddenly across the Niemen at Kovno, deal a\r\nsmashing blow at Barclay and then wheel round to crush Bagration.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the Russians they had now decided to do the right\r\nthing, and had no intention of awaiting their enemies’ pleasure. The\r\nthree corps on the Niemen were drawn back to Vilna, leaving only a\r\nlight cavalry screen along the right bank. Wittgenstein retired from\r\nRossieni to Keidani, 40 miles nearer Vilna. On June 23rd, therefore,\r\nBarclay had four corps echeloned on a line of 70 miles, nearly two\r\nmarches from the Niemen at its nearest point; and, as all were ready\r\nto retreat on Sventsiani at the shortest notice, Napoleon’s plans were\r\nalready half disconcerted. Irresolution, however, clung to the Russian\r\ncounsels, and Dokhturov was still left in a dangerously isolated\r\nposition at Lida.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd Napoleon, being himself at Wilkowiski, about 40 miles from\r\nKovno, drafted a proclamation to the army which may be regarded as\r\nthe official declaration of war. It was of the usual Napoleonic type,\r\nchiefly compounded of false statements and prophecies which were never\r\nfulfilled. Mr. Hereford George is probably correct in pronouncing that\r\n“a more unfortunate document was perhaps never penned.”\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 23rd Napoleon had under his hand opposite Kovno\r\nin the Pilwiski Forest some 214,000 men, comprising the Imperial Guard,\r\nthe reserve parks and engineers, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd _Corps d’Armée_,\r\nand the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Corps of Reserve Cavalry. At Tilsit, in line\r\nwith the main body, was the 10th Corps, under Macdonald. Eugène, with\r\nthe 4th and 6th Corps, was still some 60 miles to the right rear, and\r\ncould hardly reach the Niemen near Kovno before the 28th. General\r\nBonnal appears to consider that his absence materially contributed to\r\nthe failure of the Emperor’s strategy, but it is a little difficult\r\nentirely to agree with him. Even had the situation been as Napoleon\r\nimagined it, with the Russians extended in a long, thin line upon\r\nthe frontier, Eugène’s absence could not have fatally influenced\r\nresults. The invaders, with their overwhelming numerical superiority,\r\ncould not fail of success. Without Eugène Napoleon had 247,000 men in\r\nall opposed to Barclay’s 120,000. Bagration could hardly under any\r\ncircumstances have gained more than a temporary success over the head\r\nof the long column of divisions marching from Lublin to Augustowo,\r\nand as yet not disquieted by Tormazov on its rear. Given that Reynier\r\nand Schwarzenberg were forced to turn back to face Tormazov--as did\r\nultimately happen--Jerome would still have over 60,000 regulars against\r\nBagration’s 36,000; and Eugène’s retardation would place him in a\r\nfavourable position for supporting him. It is even permissible to\r\nargue that Eugène’s absence was rather a favourable circumstance than\r\notherwise, since the knowledge that Napoleon was short of over 70,000\r\nmen might have induced Barclay to stand to give battle, which was\r\nprecisely what Napoleon desired.\r\n\r\nAs a fact the situation was quite other than Napoleon envisaged it. Had\r\nall his corps been in position to time, the manoeuvre of Vilna would\r\nstill have failed. Had Jerome, with his whole force, reached Augustowo\r\non the 25th June, as contemplated, he could not have reached Grodno\r\nbefore the 27th. Volkovisk is nearly 50 miles farther on, and Bagration\r\nevacuated it on the 28th to retreat on Minsk. It was absolutely\r\nimpossible for Jerome to reach him. Of Barclay’s corps, the 1st was\r\nnearly two days’ march from the Niemen, and Wittgenstein had permission\r\nto retreat as soon as he had information of the French passage of the\r\nriver. Baggohufwudt, Tuchkov and Shuvalov were still farther back, out\r\nof touch with the French, who could not reach them in less than two\r\nforced marches, even if they stood fast. Dokhturov alone was somewhat\r\nisolated, and ran considerable risk of being cut off from the main\r\nbody. Still even had Dokhturov been cut from Barclay it is highly\r\nprobable that the course of events would have been little different.\r\nA junction of the two Armies of the West would have eventually been\r\neffected, and it is possible that Barclay, short of 20,000 men, would\r\nnot have made, as he did, at least one very perilous halt on his march\r\nto Smolensk.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, when once the Russian commanders had determined to adopt\r\na policy of steady retreat, and to adhere to it with more or less\r\nresolution, the campaign may almost be said to have decided itself.\r\nNapoleon was ever striving to obtain contact with his elusive foes and\r\nto fight the great battle which should crush the heart out of their\r\nresistance. But only thrice all through the advance was he able to\r\nestablish this contact, and in each case the Russians drew away without\r\nhaving sustained decisive defeat. The first operations on the Niemen\r\nwere typical of most of those which were to follow.\r\n\r\nOn June 23rd all the troops under Napoleon’s immediate command were\r\nnearly opposite Kovno. Napoleon gave the strictest orders that only\r\nlight cavalry were to approach the river; infantry, artillery and heavy\r\ncavalry were to be kept under cover in the forest, so as to conceal\r\nfrom the enemy until the last moment the exact direction in which the\r\nblow was to be dealt. Meanwhile the river was reconnoitred for a point\r\nof passage, and a bend between Kovno and the village of Poniemon, a\r\nlittle higher up, was selected by General Haxo, Davout’s chief of\r\nengineers.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak on the 23rd Napoleon in person arrived in his travelling\r\ncarriage at the bivouacs of the 1st Cavalry Corps. He descended at that\r\nof the 6th Polish Lancers, and, still anxious to conceal everything\r\nfrom the Russians until the last moment, removed his famous Guard\r\nuniform and cocked hat, and donned the coat of a Polish officer--an\r\nexample followed by the staff-officers with him. Count Soltyk, an\r\nofficer of the Lancers, has minutely described the episode. Napoleon’s\r\nstrong common sense appears in his refusal of the heavy Polish cavalry\r\nshako, and acceptance of a cap instead. He then rode forward to a\r\nvillage directly opposite Kovno, and carefully reconnoitred the place\r\nfrom the windows of the house of the village doctor. Returning to the\r\nLancers’ bivouac, he made a hasty meal, chatting meanwhile with the\r\nPolish officers, and especially asking if their uniform suited him. He\r\nthen resumed his own garments and rode off to reconnoitre the course\r\nof the river elsewhere. He approved Haxo’s selection of Poniemon, and\r\nissued elaborate orders for the passage. They obviously imply that\r\nvigorous resistance was anticipated; nothing was yet known of the\r\nRussian retirement on Vilna. They also contain much minute regulation\r\nof detail, which might well have been left to Haxo or Davout.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon and evening the 1st Corps was brought up to\r\nPoniemon, whither the pontoon trains, under General Eblé, were also\r\ndespatched. Three bridges, about 300 yards apart, were to be thrown\r\nacross. As soon as it was completely dark--that is to say, about 10\r\np.m.--General Morand, the commander of the 1st Division, crossed\r\nin person with three companies of Voltigeurs and one of Sappers,\r\nwho were ferried over in boats. As they were disembarking they were\r\ndetected by the nearest Russian picket--a detachment of the Hussars\r\nof Yelisabetgrad. They rode up to the mustering Voltigeurs, and their\r\nleader challenged in French: “Qui vive?”\r\n\r\n“France!” came the reply.\r\n\r\n“What do you do here?” asked the Russian officer.\r\n\r\n“You’ll soon see!” was the answer; and the bold officer turned rein,\r\nto report to his superiors that the long-expected invasion had begun\r\nat last. His troopers emptied their carbines in the direction of the\r\nFrench party as they rode away, but apparently without effect; and the\r\nVoltigeurs did not reply, Napoleon having issued orders that there was\r\nto be no firing except in case of extreme necessity. The bridges were\r\ncompleted by about 1 a.m. on the 24th, and Davout’s corps began to\r\ndefile across. There was no resistance; the only approach to fighting\r\nconsisted in the interchange of a few shots between the advanced French\r\ntroops and the rear-guards of the retreating Russian cavalry regiments.\r\nThe day broke as the passage was in progress: it continued practically\r\nwithout intermission all through the 24th and 25th. As a military\r\nspectacle it has, perhaps, never been surpassed; but the ease with\r\nwhich it had been effected was probably by no means entirely pleasing\r\nto Napoleon. He must have been unpleasantly conscious that the Russians\r\nhad no intention of delivering themselves into his hands, though he\r\nprobably hoped that they would stand to fight in advance of Vilna.\r\n\r\nIn the morning of the 24th Davout’s 1st Light Cavalry Brigade, under\r\nPajol, occupied Kovno, expelling the Cossack squadron which was the\r\nonly garrison; and in the afternoon Napoleon himself transferred\r\nhis head-quarters thither. He ordered a permanent pile bridge to be\r\nconstructed at the ferry, and threw another bridge over the Vilia, just\r\nabove its confluence with the Niemen.\r\n\r\nThe news of the invasion reached Alexander the same evening while he\r\nwas at a garden party at General Bennigsen’s mansion near Vilna. Next\r\nday he announced it to his army in a proclamation, and to the nation\r\nat large in another, addressed to Marshal Saltikov, Military Governor\r\nof St. Petersburg. The tone of both was worthy of the occasion, and\r\ncontrasted strongly with the arrogant and theatrical ring of that of\r\nNapoleon.\r\n\r\nOrders were issued to all the corps commanders to retreat on\r\nSventsiani. It was recognised that Platov alone could hardly achieve\r\nany serious damage to Napoleon’s communications, and he also was\r\ndirected to retire on Sventsiani by way of Lida and Smorgoni. Bagration\r\nwas warned not to allow himself to be cut from Minsk. All the orders\r\nreached their destination safely, except those to Major-General\r\nDorokhov who, with the advance-guard of the 4th Corps, was at Orani,\r\nsouth-west of Vilna. The 3rd and 4th Corps retired leisurely to the\r\nsuburbs of Vilna, which Barclay did not intend to evacuate until it\r\nbecame absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nBy the evening of the 25th the whole French army was over the Niemen\r\nand pushing forward to Vilna. Murat opened the march with the 1st and\r\n2nd Cavalry Corps. Behind were the 1st and 3rd Corps, the 3rd Cavalry\r\nCorps, and the Imperial Guard, while the 2nd Corps had crossed the\r\nVilia at Kovno and was marching along its right bank, thus forming\r\nthe flank-guard of the advance on Vilna, and threatening to cut off\r\nWittgenstein towards Keidani. Davout and Ney had each detailed a\r\nforeign regiment to guard Kovno and the bridges. The 10th Corps was\r\nordered to advance from Tilsit upon Rossieni, sweeping the right bank\r\nof the Niemen, and thus clearing the course of the river for Baste’s\r\nsupply flotillas, which were now collecting at Tilsit, whence they were\r\npushed forward to Kovno.\r\n\r\nThere was practically no fighting on the march to Vilna. The thin\r\nchain of Russian cavalry posts steadily retired as the French pressed\r\nforward: only a few shots were fired from time to time. Napoleon hoped\r\nfor a battle at Vilna and the troops made forced marches day after\r\nday to attain the desired end, at great cost to themselves, for the\r\nweather was sultry, the roads were bad, and the provision trains were\r\nalready falling to the rear. The men began to leave the ranks in order\r\nto forage for supplies, and the horses, ill-fed and over-worked, broke\r\ndown and died in great numbers. Even the artillery was ill-horsed from\r\nthe first, and the officers were forced to scour the country for draft\r\nanimals, often with very little success. Barclay was in position before\r\nVilna with the 3rd Corps and most of the 4th, and Baggohufwudt was in\r\ntouch to the north; but Alexander and his suite had already left for\r\nSventsiani, and Barclay was merely waiting until the French began to\r\nclose. The stores which could not be carried off were destroyed, and\r\nat 4 a.m. on the 28th the 3rd and 4th Corps began to defile through\r\nthe town. Barclay and his staff left about 1 p.m.; and the rear-guard\r\nfollowed, burning the bridge over the Vilia. Bruyère’s cavalry\r\ndivision, which was heading the French advance, came through the town\r\nbefore Barclay’s cavalry rear-guard was quite clear of the suburbs; and\r\nits leading regiment, the 8th Hussars, was charged and driven back,\r\nwith the loss of several prisoners, by the Cossacks of the Imperial\r\nGuard. The Russian columns were well on their way to Sventsiani, and\r\nafter three days of forced marching in tropical weather the French\r\nimpulse had expended its force.\r\n\r\nOn the same day a more serious skirmish took place near Vilkomirz.\r\nWittgenstein, falling back from Keidani, heard that Oudinot was\r\nmarching up the right bank of the Vilia and, fearing that he might be\r\nanticipated at Vilkomirz, stationed his rear-guard, under Major-General\r\nKulnev (4 battalions, 4 squadrons, 1 Cossack regiment and 6 guns), on\r\nthe 27th at Develtova, requesting General Uvarov to support him with a\r\nregiment of Dragoons. Meanwhile the 1st Corps defiled through Vilkomirz\r\non the Sventsiani road. As Kulnev, in his turn, was retiring through\r\nthe place from Develtova, he was attacked by Castex with Oudinot’s\r\nadvanced guard. The French cavalry charged the Russian Hussars and\r\nCossacks and drove them into the town with considerable loss, but\r\nKulnev succeeded in withdrawing his force across the Vilia, and burnt\r\nthe bridge, and Castex could only cannonade the Russians until the\r\narrival of infantry. Uvarov’s cavalry regiment, marching rather\r\ncarelessly to join Kulnev along the river-bank, came under artillery\r\nfire and lost several men and horses. When Oudinot’s infantry began to\r\narrive Kulnev followed his chief. He had lost about 300 men, including\r\n240 prisoners. Oudinot reported a loss of 50 killed and wounded. The\r\n2nd Corps occupied Vilkomirz, and bivouacked for the night some 2 miles\r\non the Sventsiani road.\r\n\r\nNapoleon himself entered Vilna in the afternoon of the 28th. Alexander\r\nhad sent his aide-de-camp, General Balashov, with a final message to\r\nhis opponent, offering to reopen negotiations if the French troops\r\nwithdrew across the Niemen. Napoleon, with his usual dramatic instinct,\r\nreceived Balashov in the quarters which Alexander had lately quitted.\r\nNeedless to say, nothing came of the interview. Napoleon regarded the\r\nmessage as an insult, or at best as an attempt to gain time. He merely\r\nwrote a long letter to Alexander repeating all his real or imagined\r\ngrounds for the war. Danilevski says that Balashov was directed to tell\r\nNapoleon that if he declined to listen to Alexander’s last overtures\r\nhe must expect war to the death. It is also said that Napoleon asked\r\nquestions concerning the roads to Moscow. Balashov replied that there\r\nwere several, and His Majesty might do as other monarchs had done, and\r\nchoose. Charles XII, for example, had taken the road that led by way of\r\nPoltava!\r\n\r\nNapoleon had, in fact, little reason for satisfaction. He had, as he\r\nhoped, debouched suddenly into the midst of his opponent’s line of\r\ndefence; he had collected enormous forces upon his chosen point of\r\nattack, and had carefully concealed it until the last moment. His\r\ntroops had made tremendous exertions to carry out his strategy. And\r\nyet hardly anything had in reality been achieved. He was in possession\r\nof his enemy’s empty head-quarters, and that was all. His army had\r\nsuffered severely in the impetuous rush upon Vilna, while that of\r\nRussia had quietly withdrawn out of his reach. The carefully planned\r\nblow, which was to have been crushing, had been wasted upon the empty\r\nair.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th there was a violent thunderstorm, followed by five days\r\nof continuous rain. The results were most disastrous. Movements of\r\ntroops, though much impeded, were not absolutely checked; but the\r\nvast trains on the Vilna-Kovno road were entirely disorganised. The\r\nbad roads and tracks became little better than quagmires. The horses\r\nbroke down completely under the additional strain, especially since the\r\ncountry could supply very little fodder to replace that left behind\r\nin abandoned vehicles. The defects of the transport became evident.\r\nThe waggons were too heavy for the bad Polish roads, and in order to\r\nforward any supplies at all they had to be replaced by country carts,\r\nwhich were only capable of carrying much smaller loads. The natural\r\nconsequences were a shortage of food supplies, and much marauding in\r\nquest of them. The Lithuanians, whom the French were supposed to be\r\nfreeing from the Russian yoke, were maltreated and plundered everywhere\r\nby their so-called deliverers. Requisitions, however unsparing,\r\nentirely failed to re-establish the wrecked transport. The army was so\r\nhuge, its encumbrances so enormous, that the poverty-stricken country\r\ncould not supply the number of draft animals needed. The artillery\r\nalone left 120 guns or more and hundreds of waggons at Vilna owing to\r\nlack of horses. The number of the latter lost may be conservatively\r\nestimated at 10,000; and some 30,000 soldiers were straggling about the\r\ncountry, marauding for food and committing every kind of outrage.\r\n\r\nNapoleon himself remained in Vilna for over a fortnight. The 4th and\r\n6th Corps had only just reached the Niemen, and it was absolutely\r\nnecessary to bring up to the front the magazines from Königsberg.\r\nHe also wished to organise Lithuania, or rather to exploit it. A\r\nprovisional government of French partisans was set up at Vilna;\r\ngarrisons were distributed; and officials placed over the various towns\r\nand districts. The first act of the Government was to order levies\r\nof horse and foot for Napoleon’s service; one cavalry regiment was\r\nto consist entirely of Lithuanian squires, and to be attached to the\r\nImperial Guard. Otherwise the Government could exercise practically no\r\ncivil functions; its duties were simply such as arose from the military\r\noccupation of the country. The peasants were reduced to abject misery\r\nby endless requisitions, and by the lawless violence of the stragglers\r\nwho swarmed everywhere. The French _sous-préfet_ of Novi Troki, a\r\nplace less than 20 miles from Vilna, was plundered and stripped by\r\nmarauding soldiers on his way thither, and if such an event could take\r\nplace within a day’s march of Napoleon’s head-quarters, the state of\r\naffairs farther afield may be imagined. Napoleon’s stringent orders\r\nagainst pillage and disorder were little better than useless. The\r\npillage arose simply from lack of food, and the latter was the natural\r\noutcome of the fact that the expedition was too large to work in the\r\nexisting conditions. Napoleon had taken immense pains to organise it,\r\nand up to a point he had foreseen and provided for everything. But he\r\nhad not taken into full account physical difficulties: he had, amongst\r\nother blunders, organised a wheeled transport for which roads hardly\r\nexisted, and he had failed to perceive that the vast magnitude of his\r\nenterprise automatically created fresh obstacles to success, or at any\r\nrate enormously increased those which already existed.\r\n\r\nThough on reaching Vilna Napoleon must have realised that his strategy\r\nhad already in part miscarried, he at once entered upon the execution\r\nof the second part of the plan--the crushing of Bagration’s army\r\nwhich, as he hoped, was already closely pressed by Jerome. As a fact\r\nBagration left Volkovisk that very day for Minsk, while Jerome did\r\nnot reach Grodno until the 30th. So far as Jerome was concerned,\r\ntherefore, Bagration was in no danger, and it was only the vacillation\r\nat the Russian Imperial head-quarters which later brought him within\r\nmeasurable distance of destruction. There were other forces within\r\nBagration’s sphere of operations which the French Emperor might hope\r\nto sweep also into his net. Platov, from Grodno, could hardly hope\r\nto reach the First Army with the French in force at Vilna; while the\r\nadvance-guard of the 4th Corps, after waiting at Orani for orders until\r\nthe 27th, was also isolated. A more important quarry than either of\r\nthese, however, was Barclay’s detached left wing under Dokhturov, which\r\nhad only just started from the neighbourhood of Lida, having of course\r\nreceived its orders last.\r\n\r\nNapoleon therefore ordered the following movements: Oudinot, supported\r\nby Doumerc’s Cuirassier Division from Grouchy’s Corps, was to follow\r\nWittgenstein from Vilkomirz towards Sventsiani. Murat, with Montbrun’s\r\nCavalry Corps and Friant’s and Gudin’s Infantry Divisions, was directed\r\nto pursue Barclay’s central columns. Nansouty, with two of his three\r\ndivisions and Morand’s Infantry Division, was directed upon Svir,\r\nnearly due east of Vilna, with the object of falling on the flank of\r\nDokhturov’s column. Davout with his 4th and 5th Divisions, Pajol’s\r\nCavalry Brigade, the Lancers of the Guard, Grouchy’s two remaining\r\ncavalry divisions, Valence’s Cuirassier Division from Nansouty’s Corps,\r\nand the Legion of the Vistula, about 45,000 men in all, was to advance\r\nupon Minsk and intercept the retreat of Bagration. Davout’s other\r\nlight cavalry brigade (Bordesoulle) was sent south-westward from Vilna\r\nto scout in that direction, and on the 30th encountered Dorokhov’s\r\ndetachment, which he took for the rear-guard of Baggohufwudt’s Corps.\r\nDorokhov, seeing that French troops were now at Vilna, retreated\r\nsouthward in the hope of joining Platov and, ultimately, Bagration.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Davout and Dokhturov, advancing on converging lines, were\r\nrapidly approaching. Dokhturov was marching from Lida in two columns,\r\nand on the 30th his left flank-guard, consisting of a brigade of\r\nPahlen’s cavalry, under General Kreutz, reached Ochmiana on the\r\nVilna-Minsk road just as Pajol’s brigade was approaching from Vilna.\r\nThe danger must, to the Russian generals, have appeared very great,\r\nand had they not shown extraordinary energy it would have been so,\r\nfor although Davout’s infantry was considerably in rear of Pajol it\r\ncould easily arrive next day and assail the left flank of Dokhturov’s\r\ncolumn as it crossed the road. Dokhturov however, as on another and\r\ngreater emergency, rose to the occasion. He called upon his men for a\r\ngreat effort; and on the 1st of July the 6th Corps and Pahlen’s cavalry\r\ncrossed the Vilna-Minsk road just ahead of Davout’s advancing columns,\r\nand pressed on towards Sventsiani. There was some brisk skirmishing at\r\nOchmiana between Kreutz and Pajol; but at night the bulk of Dokhturov’s\r\nforce had reached Svir, after a splendid forced march of 28 miles on\r\nan execrable road, with a loss of only some scores of men and a few\r\nretarded baggage-waggons. During the march of the 2nd the trains were\r\nharassed by Nansouty’s advanced guard and a portion of them captured,\r\nbut that evening Dokhturov was in line with the rest of the First\r\nArmy about Sventsiani. His prompt decision, admirably seconded by the\r\nsteadiness and fine marching of his troops, had extricated him safely\r\nfrom a very dangerous position.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Barclay and Wittgenstein had operated their retreat from\r\nVilna and Vilkomirz with little difficulty, and with hardly any\r\nfighting. On the 2nd of July the First Army about Sventsiani numbered\r\nabout 114,000 men; but the Tzar’s advisers had now definitely decided\r\nnot to fight before reaching the Düna. The magazines which could not be\r\ncarried away were burned; and on the 3rd the retreat was continued, the\r\n2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th Corps retiring directly on Drissa, covered by a\r\nrear-guard under Korff, while Wittgenstein and Dokhturov fell back on\r\nthe wings.\r\n\r\nThe retreat was conducted steadily and with no great haste. Alexander\r\nand Phull were impatient for the arrival of the army at Drissa, and the\r\nlatter sent Clausewitz, afterwards the historian of the war, to hasten\r\nthe march. Barclay, who knew better than Phull the demoralising effects\r\nof a hasty retreat, was very angry, and declined to hurry. On the 5th\r\nthere was a slight action at Davigelishki between Sebastiani’s leading\r\nbrigade under Subervie and Korff’s cavalry rear-guard. The French were\r\nrepulsed, and Prince von Hohenlohe, the Colonel of the 3rd Württemberg\r\nChasseurs, was captured. On the 6th and 8th, however, the Russians\r\nmade night marches and distanced their pursuers; and on the 11th the\r\nwhole of the Russian centre and left were at Drissa, while Wittgenstein\r\nwas at Druia, a little lower down the Düna. There were at Drissa and\r\nDünaburg 19 reserve battalions, all very weak, and 20 fairly strong\r\ndepôt squadrons. Most of them were assigned to Wittgenstein, who formed\r\nthem into provisional regiments.\r\n\r\nEugène and St. Cyr reached the Niemen on the 29th of June, and crossed\r\nat Prenn on the 30th, one of the pontoon bridges from Kovno being\r\nused for the purpose. Thence they marched for Vilna, the 4th Corps\r\nleading. The roads were frightfully bad; the rain poured in torrents\r\nwithout intermission, and, to add to their other miseries, the men\r\nwere half-starved, the trains being even less able to keep up with the\r\nmarch than they had been a few days before. Eugène reached Novi Troki\r\non the 4th, and there rested for two days. St. Cyr had halted about\r\nhalf-way from the Niemen. On the 30th Poniatowski and Latour-Maubourg\r\nreached Grodno. King Jerome, with the 8th Corps, was near Augustowo.\r\nReynier, with the 7th, was at Bielsk on the Warsaw-Bielostok road; and\r\nSchwarzenberg, advancing with characteristic slowness and caution, some\r\nway east of Warsaw. Reynier’s special duty was to cover Warsaw, and\r\nJerome could not therefore count upon him until he had been relieved\r\nby the Austrians. On the 30th Jerome received orders to march on\r\nOchmiana--this was under the impression that Dokhturov’s corps, which\r\nhad just reached that place, was the army of Bagration. Next day,\r\nhowever, he received fresh directions. Napoleon had ascertained the\r\nreal identity of the troops at Ochmiana and now ordered his brother to\r\ndirect the 5th and 8th Corps upon Minsk, and the 7th upon Nesvizh. It\r\nis obvious that these contradictory directions must have harassed and\r\nconfused the inexperienced general whom his brother’s will had placed\r\nin command of three army corps; and his chief-of-staff Marchand, a\r\ngood enough divisional leader, was hardly the man to make good his\r\nchief’s deficiencies. Jerome’s troops were so exhausted by the march\r\nfrom Warsaw, over bad roads and in pouring rain, that he felt himself\r\nobliged to give them a brief rest at Grodno. Reynier was delayed at the\r\npassage of the Narew, Platov having carefully destroyed all the boats.\r\nMinsk, Jerome’s indicated objective, is nearly 180 miles from Grodno by\r\nNovogrodek and Mir, and Nesvizh 140 from Bielostok.\r\n\r\nBagration left Volkovisk for Minsk late on June 28th. He expected\r\nto reach it on July 7th, but on the same day Davout was approaching\r\nOchmiana, and could easily arrive before him. On the 30th, however,\r\nColonel Benkendorff, one of Alexander’s aides-de-camp, arrived with\r\nfresh orders, by which Bagration was to march upon Drissa to join\r\nBarclay. Bagration, unaware that Davout was already advancing on Minsk\r\nfrom Vilna, and probably believing that the order would not have been\r\nsent had not Napoleon been following Barclay with the bulk of his\r\nforces, decided to join his colleague by the shortest possible route.\r\nHe reached Slonim on July 1st, and on the 3rd arrived at Novogrodek,\r\n40 miles on the Ochmiana road, where the 27th Division, marching\r\nfrom Minsk, joined him. Early on the 4th the head of the column was\r\nat Nikolaev-on-Niemen, and, although there were by no means too many\r\npontoons, two bridges were thrown over the flooded river. The passage\r\nwas begun as early as possible, and the 8th Corps was already across\r\nwhen reports arrived from Platov. He announced that he was at Vologin,\r\nsome 20 miles from Nikolaev, that he was skirmishing with French\r\ncavalry, and that they belonged to Davout’s Corps, which was marching\r\non Minsk. Platov had reached Vologin on his way to join Barclay; and\r\nthere he was met by Dorokhov returning to effect a junction with\r\nBagration at Minsk.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd Jerome’s advance-guard had started eastward from Grodno, and\r\non the 4th his main body was at last under way. Contradictory orders\r\nand lack of information had led Bagration into a situation of grave\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nThe Second Army, with Platov and Dorokhov, counted now about 45,000\r\nregulars, 9000 irregulars and 192 guns. Davout had about 42,000 men,\r\nbut only 30,000 actually in hand. Jerome was advancing from Grodno with\r\nnearly 55,000 more; his advance-guard was some 60 miles from Novogrodek\r\nin Bagration’s rear.\r\n\r\nBagration, of course, estimated Davout’s force as about 70,000 men--the\r\noriginal strength of the 1st Corps; and probably reckoned Jerome’s army\r\nat about equal numbers. After considering his position, he decided to\r\nmake a dash for Minsk by way of the left bank of the Niemen and the\r\nSlonim-Minsk high-road, hoping that Platov and Dorokhov would be able\r\nto impose on Davout and hinder his march until the 8th, by which date\r\nBagration hoped to reach Minsk. The 8th Corps was hastily crossed back\r\nover the Niemen; the pontoons were taken up; and the Second Army pushed\r\nfor the Minsk road beyond Mir, which it reached on the 6th, having\r\ncovered nearly 40 miles in two days.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, Platov’s mass of irregulars and Dorokhov’s\r\nsmall detachment could not for a moment withstand the march of Davout’s\r\ncolumn. When the French infantry pushed steadily forward the Cossacks\r\ncould only withdraw, and Dorokhov was not strong enough to defend\r\nan open town against 30,000 sabres and bayonets. Platov therefore\r\nretreated southward to join Bagration, and on the 7th Davout’s\r\nadvanced guard entered Minsk unopposed, Compans, Desaix and Valence\r\narriving next day. He captured in the town over 300,000 pounds of\r\nflour, and a vast quantity of forage, as well as much barrack and\r\nhospital equipment. On the same day Colbert’s Lancer Brigade, which\r\nwas covering Davout’s left flank and rear, entered Vileika, where he\r\nfound 180,000 pounds of flour, 200,000 of biscuit, 4500 bottles of\r\nspirits, and over 200 tons of forage, besides clothing and hospital\r\nstores. These captures were the first of any importance that had yet\r\nbeen made. The loss to the Russians was of far less importance than the\r\ngain to the French, upon whom inadequate supplies, hard marches, and\r\ntrying climatic conditions had already had the worst effect. Even in\r\nthe regiments of Davout’s Corps, notoriously the best disciplined and\r\nadministered of the army, disorder was rife. The Dutch 33rd Léger was\r\na prime offender. During the march to Minsk it left nearly half its\r\nnumbers behind as marauders; and eventually Napoleon was obliged to\r\nissue a special order against them. Davout’s anger at its misconduct\r\nvented itself for days in his despatches and conversation; and, as was\r\nbut too often the case with him, he allowed it to exceed the bounds of\r\nconsideration and decency. The result was a permanent breach between\r\nhimself and Desaix.\r\n\r\nBagration at Mir learned that Davout, greatly his superior in numbers\r\nas he believed, was across his path at Minsk, while Jerome’s\r\nadvance-guard was approaching Novogrodek, and Reynier was on the march\r\nfrom Bielostok to Slonim. He decided, rightly under the circumstances\r\nas they presented themselves to him, to march for the Berezina at\r\nBobruisk, which, as we have seen, was fortified, and thence make for\r\nthe Düna by way of Mohilev and Orsha on the Dnieper. A more perilous\r\nmarch can hardly be imagined, for it would take him right across the\r\nfront of the French columns moving eastward from Vilna and Minsk.\r\nBagration, however, expected that Davout’s objective was Bobruisk, as\r\nappears by his action a few days later, and evidently hoped to get\r\nround his left flank. On July 7th the 8th Corps marched to Nesvizh on\r\nthe Brest-Litovsk-Bobruisk high-road, and the 7th to Novi-Svergen on\r\nthat to Minsk, in order to rally Dorokhov, while Platov, with some\r\nCossacks and one of Raievski’s infantry regiments, took post at Mir\r\nto guard the road from Novogrodek against Jerome. On the 8th Raievski\r\njoined Borozdin, and both corps remained at Nesvizh until the 10th.\r\nA halt was imperative to rest the weary troops, who had marched over\r\n150 miles in nine days, on wretched roads and in generally terrible\r\nweather; and it was also necessary to enable the jaded trains to get\r\nwell forward on the road to Bobruisk. Bagration was fuming at the\r\nnecessity for continual retreat, and on the 8th wrote an excited letter\r\non the subject to Count Arakcheiev.\r\n\r\nOn the same day Jerome’s advance-guard, Rosniecki’s Polish Cavalry\r\nDivision, reached Novogrodek. On the 9th the bulk of the 5th and 8th\r\nCorps arrived, Reynier reached Slonim from Bielostok, and Rosniecki\r\nstarted for Mir. On that day his leading brigade under General Turno\r\ncame in contact with Platov, and a brisk action ensued, as the result\r\nof which the Poles were driven back with a loss of over 100 prisoners,\r\nbesides killed and wounded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL PRINCE BAGRATION, COMMANDER OF THE SECOND\r\nRUSSIAN ARMY IN 1812]\r\n\r\nNext day Bagration started Borozdin with the divisions of Neverovski\r\nand Prince Karl of Mecklenburg on the road to Bobruisk. He kept the 7th\r\nCorps still at Nesvizh to give the men another day’s rest, and held\r\nback Voronzov’s division to support Platov if necessary, reinforcing\r\nthe latter with one regiment of infantry and three of cavalry, under\r\nMajor-General Vassilchikov.\r\n\r\nPlatov had already evacuated Mir and drawn back towards Nesvizh. On\r\nthe 10th he was attacked by Rosniecki, and a cavalry action on a large\r\nscale ensued. Rosniecki had with him six regiments--some 3300 lances\r\nand sabres, while Tyskiewicz’s brigade, about 1200 more, was at Mir.\r\nPlatov and Vassilchikov had at their immediate disposal at least 2000\r\nregular cavalry and 3000 Cossacks. Rosniecki’s first two brigades,\r\nincluding that of Turno, and Vassilchikov’s regulars crashed together\r\nin a furious hand-to-hand combat, with fairly equal fortune; but\r\nthe third brigade coming up in support was enveloped by a cloud of\r\nCossacks and broken. Thereupon the whole division was forced to give\r\nground, hotly pressed by the Russian Hussars, Dragoons and Cossacks. A\r\ncomplete rout was only averted by the gallant advance of Tyskiewicz’s\r\nbrigade, which covered the retreat and enabled the broken regiments\r\nto rally near Mir. The Russians thereupon drew off. They had suffered\r\nconsiderably, and two Cossack colonels had been killed. But the Poles\r\nhad lost over 700 men, and it may be imagined that the morale of the\r\nPolish army was considerably shaken.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th Raievski and Voronzov evacuated Nesvizh and marched some\r\n20 miles to Romanovo, while Platov fell back on Nesvizh. On the 12th\r\nBagration made another long march to Slutsk, while Platov followed to\r\nRomanovo.\r\n\r\nAt Slutsk Bagration learned that French troops had been located at\r\nSvislocz on the Berezina, about 27 miles north of Bobruisk. The\r\ninference was that Davout was marching to anticipate him at the latter\r\nplace. He sent forward Raievski at once to the threatened fortress\r\nwith the 7th Corps and some cavalry and Cossacks, while the 8th waited\r\nat Slutsk for the arrival of Platov.\r\n\r\nRomanovo lay on the small river Morvez, which was there spanned\r\nby a bridge. The advance-guard of Jerome’s army was formed on the\r\n14th, as before, by Rosniecki’s division and Tyskiewicz’s brigade;\r\nLatour-Maubourg, with the German and Polish Cuirassiers forming\r\nthe rest of his cavalry corps, was following some distance to the\r\nrear. Platov had part of his force in advance of the bridge, and as\r\nTyskiewicz’s brigade came on it was suddenly charged, cut up and driven\r\nback. The Russians then retired across the bridge, and Rosniecki,\r\nfollowing, plunged into a heavy cross-fire from Platov’s infantry\r\nregiment and horse artillery, and only extricated himself with severe\r\nloss. The whole division was thrust back in disorder until it reached\r\nLatour-Maubourg and his cuirassier division. The Polish losses had been\r\nvery heavy; the 1st Chasseurs had been practically destroyed. Platov\r\ntook 300 prisoners. He knew better than to expose his irregulars and\r\nlight horsemen to the charge of the Saxon and Westphalian Cuirassiers\r\nand retired in the night to Slutsk. This released Borozdin, who\r\nfollowed in the track of Raievski; and in this way the Second Army,\r\nRaievski leading and Platov bringing up the rear, arrived at Bobruisk,\r\nwhere it was completely concentrated on the 18th. It had suffered much\r\nfrom fatigue and sickness during its long and painful marches, and\r\nBagration felt it necessary to use six of the weak reserve battalions\r\nin the fortress to recruit his depleted regiments. But the Second Army\r\nwas at least safe. A glance at the map will show that all the way from\r\nNesvizh it had the Pinsk morasses on its right; and had Jerome and\r\nDavout been able to combine their attacks, the result to it might well\r\nhave been fatal.\r\n\r\nIn following Bagration on his march to Bobruisk the course of events\r\nelsewhere has been somewhat anticipated. On July 14th King Jerome\r\nhad thrown up his command. A little previously he had quarrelled with\r\nVandamme, who commanded the 8th Corps under him. Vandamme was a man\r\nwhose general character is entitled to no kind of respect. His conduct\r\nin Germany had been abominable. He was, however, a thorough soldier,\r\nand could not endure Jerome’s easy-going ideas of military discipline.\r\nThe consequence was an open quarrel and the supersession of Vandamme.\r\nNapoleon, who knew his insubordinate disposition, did not traverse\r\nJerome’s action. But the delay at Grodno and the failure to close with\r\nBagration kindled his wrath, all the more so since his own immediate\r\noperations had miscarried. He vented his rage and disappointment in two\r\nviolently abusive letters, and Jerome left the army.\r\n\r\nAs regards the degree of blame which attaches to Jerome, it is obvious\r\nthat, but for the ill-advised order to march upon Drissa, Bagration\r\nwould have been in no danger. He left Volkovisk on June 28th; Jerome\r\ndid not even reach Grodno until the 30th. The vile Polish roads,\r\nrendered worse by the rain, made marching extremely difficult. A rest\r\nmay well have been necessary for the over-worked and ill-fed troops;\r\nand Jerome was obliged to wait until Reynier had been relieved by the\r\nslowly advancing Austrians. Owing to the orders which he had received\r\nfrom head-quarters, Bagration all but marched into the midst of the\r\nforces manoeuvring to intercept him. It is clear that, had Jerome moved\r\neastward from Grodno at once, he would have pressed his antagonist\r\nhard. On the other hand, he had to take into account the harassed state\r\nof his troops, their lack of adequate supplies, the miserable roads,\r\nthe absence of Reynier, the slowness of Schwarzenberg, and last, not\r\nleast, the hidden Russian army of Tormazov, which might prove very\r\nformidable. Napoleon in his place would probably have taken the risk\r\nof an advance of Tormazov on Warsaw. Jerome did not, and, indeed,\r\nseeing his position as a subordinate, could not, do so. It is possible\r\nthat he did not act with all the vigour which circumstances demanded;\r\nbut in that case the blame must be laid at the door of Napoleon\r\nfor appointing to a vitally important command a man who lacked the\r\nnecessary qualifications for it. Napoleon also was directing manoeuvres\r\non the basis of hypotheses which might, and in fact did, prove\r\nunfounded. He appears rather to have ignored geographical and climatic\r\nconditions; he was certainly ill-informed as to distances. Finally he\r\nwas committing the same error which had already cost him dear in Spain,\r\nin endeavouring to direct complicated strategic manoeuvres from a\r\ndistance; and the optimism which was becoming a mental disease with him\r\nbadly affected his calculations.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, apparently believing that Bagration was stronger than\r\nwas actually the case, and that he might break northward, directed\r\nEugène with the 4th Corps on July 7th in the track of Davout; but\r\nsoon becoming aware that his intelligence was false, recalled him to\r\nSmorgoni, where he arrived on the 12th. On the 14th Eugène left to\r\nsupport the advance on Drissa, marching by way of Vileika, where the\r\nmagazines captured by Colbert afforded supplies. Nevertheless food\r\nwas invariably scanty. The wretched roads wore out the men, who fell\r\nsick or straggled in numbers. The horses fared still worse, and many\r\ndied. St. Cyr, meanwhile, had marched by Novi Troki to Vilna, whence\r\nhe was directed by Glubokoïe also on Drissa. The march of the unhappy\r\nBavarians will later be alluded to. On July 11th Napoleon ordered\r\nMortier with part of the Guard also upon Glubokoïe, and next day the\r\nfirst detachment of the Head-quarters Staff was directed thither. De\r\nFezensac, who was with this detachment, notes that the Young Guard were\r\nalready suffering from the effects of the tropical heat, scanty rations\r\nand fatigue--especially the newly formed “Flanqueurs-Chasseurs.” Yet\r\nNapoleon in a letter of the 11th suggests that Mortier can live on the\r\ncountry!\r\n\r\nThe 10th Corps, after clearing the right bank of the Niemen, had been\r\ndirected north-eastward towards Mitau and Riga, which latter place\r\nit was destined to besiege. The operations of the 10th Corps were\r\nso isolated and otherwise of so languid a nature that they may for\r\nthe moment be ignored. Here it is only necessary to observe that the\r\n10th Corps was moving north-eastward on a broad front, the Prussians\r\nadvancing on Mitau, the 10th Division, Poles and Germans under\r\nGrandjean, on Dünaburg. At the latter place there was a bridge-head\r\ngarrisoned by some reserve battalions.\r\n\r\nDavout, having occupied Minsk, remained there for some days. The\r\nhalt was necessary in order to rally the stragglers and re-establish\r\ndiscipline. It was also utilised in commencing the organisation of\r\nMinsk as one of the main depôts of the army, for which its situation\r\nat the intersection of the Warsaw-Moscow and Vilna-Kiev high-roads\r\nadmirably fitted it.\r\n\r\nDavout had rightly inferred that his occupation of Minsk would oblige\r\nBagration to retire upon Bobruisk. He might then endeavour to march up\r\nthe left bank of the Berezina to the Minsk-Smolensk road at Borisov or\r\nBobr, and thence press on to join Barclay. The Marshal accordingly sent\r\nforward his advance-guard, under Bordesoulle, to reconnoitre Borisov\r\nand occupy it if possible. He estimated Bagration’s strength, from the\r\nreports of spies and peasants, at 16 to 18 regiments of infantry and\r\n120 guns, besides cavalry. The evaluation was much below the truth, and\r\ngives the impression that his informants had only seen and counted the\r\nregiments of one of Bagration’s two corps and the 27th Division.\r\n\r\nBorisov was undefended. Working parties were busy almost until the\r\nlast on the entrenchments of the bridge-head; but the only troops\r\navailable to defend it were two skeleton battalions, which retired\r\non the approach of the French to Mohilev. The place was occupied by\r\nBordesoulle on the 11th, and there and in the vicinity were taken\r\na large amount of flour and forage, about 80,000 pounds of salt,\r\n16 spiked guns, 4000 cannon-balls and shells, some thousands of\r\nentrenching tools, and a quantity of hospital equipment and supplies.\r\n\r\nDavout’s other cavalry brigade, under Pajol, was directed on Igumen,\r\n35 miles south-east of Minsk, and thence also upon the Berezina. On\r\nthe 13th it captured a Russian convoy of 180 waggons, which, however,\r\nbeing left slenderly guarded, was retaken next day by Cossacks. Pajol,\r\nmeanwhile, occupied the crossings of the Berezina at Berezino and\r\nelsewhere, and awaited the arrival of Davout. He reconnoitred towards\r\nBobruisk, and it was the presence of one of his detachments at Svislocz\r\nwhich alarmed Bagration and induced him to precipitate his march.\r\n\r\nDavout decided that to advance on Bobruisk would probably be waste of\r\ntime, since Bagration could almost certainly reach the place before\r\nhim. He therefore rightly determined to march for Mohilev, 110 miles\r\neast of Minsk, and only some 60 from Berezino. Bagration was on the\r\n14th still two days’ march west of Bobruisk with his advance-guard,\r\nwhile Borozdin and Platov were yet farther off, and could not reach the\r\nfortress until the 18th. Thence to Mohilev was four long days’ march\r\non bad roads, while Davout had a much shorter distance to traverse.\r\nEven if he reached Bobruisk before the Russians, they could cross the\r\nBerezina under cover of the fortifications.\r\n\r\nWhile Davout remained about Minsk, Grouchy, with his two cavalry\r\ndivisions and Colbert’s Lancers, supported by Claparède’s Polish\r\nLegion, was making a sweep northward and westward to the great bend of\r\nthe Dnieper near Orsha. On the 14th he entered Lepel, 48 miles north of\r\nBorisov, capturing large magazines of food-stuffs and forage, besides\r\nabout 160 Russian prisoners. He then turned south-eastward to Orsha,\r\nwhich was occupied on the 18th without resistance. The magazines of\r\nprovisions were even more important than those at Lepel, and a number\r\nof boats and pontoons were also taken.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of King Jerome left Davout in command of the whole\r\nNapoleonic right wing. Napoleon had intended that the Marshal should\r\nassume chief command only when the junction of the two forces should be\r\ncomplete, and later he reprimanded him for doing so before it had been\r\neffected. It is difficult to perceive what other course lay open to\r\nDavout. He made various efforts to induce the offended King to retain\r\nhis command, but in vain: Jerome was thoroughly disgusted.\r\n\r\nDavout’s advanced guard left Minsk on July 12th, and by the 15th his\r\nmain body was concentrated near Igumen. Bagration’s whole force could\r\nnot reach Bobruisk until the 18th, the French thus had a long start in\r\nthe race to Mohilev. The untrustworthy 33rd Léger was left to garrison\r\nMinsk. The 5th Corps and Latour-Maubourg were directed by Igumen on\r\nMohilev, and the 8th, temporarily commanded by General Tharreau, by\r\nMinsk and Borisov on Orsha.\r\n\r\nThe 7th Corps was ordered back to Slonim by Napoleon. The Emperor,\r\ndeceived by Tormazov’s long inactivity, had made up his mind that he\r\nneed fear nothing from him. As a fact it was lack of preparation and\r\nthe necessity for completing it which was keeping Tormazov inactive;\r\nhis army was very far from a sham. Napoleon, however, deciding that the\r\n34,000 Austrians were unnecessary in that region, determined to call\r\nthem up to the centre. Schwarzenberg had crossed the Bug at Mogilnitza\r\non July 3rd, and a week later reached Pruzhani, 60 miles on the\r\nBrest-Litovsk-Minsk road. Detachments occupied Pinsk and other places,\r\nand captured large supplies and immense quantities of salt. Otherwise\r\nthe Austrians had been inactive. The spirit both of officers and men\r\nwas decidedly hostile to the enterprise in which they were engaged,\r\nand though Schwarzenberg himself was a Francophile he was naturally\r\nvery cautious, and probably under orders to do as little as possible.\r\nSuch considerations would naturally incline Napoleon to wish to have\r\nthe Austrians under his own eye. Reynier, with the 7th Corps, was to\r\ntake Schwarzenberg’s place and cover the frontier of the Grand Duchy of\r\nWarsaw. These plans, however, could not be executed, for on July 23rd\r\nthe Russian Third Army appeared on the scene with momentous results,\r\nand both Schwarzenberg and Reynier had to be diverted to check it.\r\n\r\nDavout crossed the Berezina at Berezino on July 15th and advanced on\r\nMohilev, leaving Pajol with three regiments of cavalry and one of\r\ninfantry to guard communications. On the 19th he was near Mohilev\r\nwith Compans, Desaix and Valence. The place was defended only by four\r\nskeleton battalions, and was easily carried by Desaix on the 20th.\r\nEighteen officers and 200 men were taken; with 120,000 rations of\r\nbiscuit and flour, some thousands of muskets, and several thousand\r\npounds of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nPajol on the 19th reported that Bobruisk was full of Russian troops.\r\nDavout therefore inferred that he would soon be attacked, and made\r\npreparations accordingly. He called up Claparède from the northward,\r\nwhere he was supporting Grouchy, and sent for his reserve artillery,\r\nwhich was still in rear. He had already sent to Poniatowski and\r\nTharreau to hasten their march. He was by no means at his ease, since\r\nhe had, as he says, only 16,000 men (an underestimate) and expected to\r\nbe attacked by 50,000. He looked about for a position in which he could\r\nreceive battle against superior numbers, and found one at Saltanovka,\r\nabout 8 miles on the Bobruisk road.\r\n\r\nBagration had received orders to advance on the Düna by way of Orsha,\r\nand on the 19th he started Raievski with the 7th Corps, Platov,\r\nDorokhov and the bulk of Sievers’ cavalry, for Mohilev. Borozdin, with\r\nthe divisions of Karl of Mecklenburg and Neverovski, followed on the\r\n20th, while Voronzov brought up the rear with his division of combined\r\ngrenadier companies, the 5th Chasseurs from Paskievich’s division and\r\nthe Kharkov Dragoons. The garrison of Bobruisk, under General Ignatiev,\r\nconsisted now of about 6000 men. The artillery armament was fairly\r\npowerful, but the fortifications were by no means very formidable.\r\nGeneral Zapolski, commanding the reserve troops at Mozyr, was ordered\r\nto hold firm there so as to cover Tormazov’s line of communications\r\nwith Kiev.\r\n\r\nBagration himself was furious at the necessity for retreating, and his\r\nletters are couched in terms of angry disgust at the inaction of the\r\nmain army. “You have 100,000 men,” he says in one place. “Well, fight!”\r\nAnd elsewhere, “Why don’t we fight? We are worse than the Prussians and\r\nAustrians.” His troops were weakened by nineteen days of marching in\r\nrain, heat and over vile tracks. Had there only been a little fighting\r\nBagration would have been less exasperated. He says in one letter that\r\nhe had galloped forty versts on the chance of seeing an engagement--an\r\nadmission which throws a somewhat amusing light upon his impetuous\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st Bagration’s leading troops reached Staroi Bykhov, some 25\r\nmiles south of Mohilev, and on the same day the advanced Cossacks,\r\nunder Sissoiev, met the remains of the Mohilev garrison pursued by the\r\n3rd Chasseurs-à-cheval, the only light cavalry regiment which Davout\r\nhad retained. Unexpectedly assailed, the Chasseurs were broken and\r\npursued to within a few miles of Mohilev, losing over 200 prisoners\r\nalone, and only rallying under cover of the 85th Regiment, which moved\r\nout to their relief.\r\n\r\nDavout, having ascertained that behind the Cossacks were at least two\r\nRussian infantry divisions, collected on the 22nd his whole disposable\r\nforce in his chosen position at Saltanovka. His left rested on the\r\nmarshy bank of the Dnieper and was unassailable. His front was covered\r\nby a stream flowing in a difficult ravine, spanned at Saltanovka, some\r\n1200 yards from the Dnieper, by a wooden bridge. About a mile farther\r\nup stood the hamlet and water-mill of Fatova, where a second rivulet,\r\nflowing parallel to the Dnieper, joins the first. On this, a mile from\r\nFatova, lay the village of Selets. About Saltanovka there were thick\r\nwoods, especially on the north bank of the stream; farther west the\r\nground was more open, but broken and difficult. Generally speaking,\r\nthe position was extremely strong; only on the right was it at all\r\nassailable. Desaix’s division guarded it, the 85th Regiment, under\r\nGeneral Friederichs, on the left, the 108th on the right. The bridge\r\nwas barricaded; the villages were prepared for defence. One of Compans’\r\nregiments supported Desaix near Selets; the other two were held back\r\nto meet a turning movement, and only brought up later. Valence’s\r\nCuirassiers and the remains of the 3rd Chasseurs were in reserve near\r\nSelets. The whole force counted some 20,000 men with 56 guns. Claparède\r\nand the artillery reserve could not arrive before the 23rd.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd the head of Bagration’s army was at Dashkova, 5 miles\r\nsouth of Saltanovka. Bagration ordered Raievski with the 7th Corps and\r\nSievers’ cavalry to attack next day. His reason seems to be expressed\r\nin his letter to Raievski on the 22nd. He tells him that he has only\r\n6000 men in his front, according to his own intelligence; he is\r\ntherefore to attack with God’s help and enter Mohilev on the heels of\r\nthe enemy. Bagration’s reasoning clearly is that, Mohilev being only\r\nheld by a detachment, Raievski may easily clear the way, and the army\r\nget through towards Orsha before the arrival of the French main body.\r\nThere is no indication that he intended to turn Davout’s right with\r\nBorozdin and Neverovski while Raievski was attacking in front: they\r\ncould not reach Dashkova until late on the 23rd.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n1 verst = 2/3 mile. Russian Troops shown black, French shaded.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF SALTANOVKA (July 23rd, 1812)\r\n\r\nFought by Marshal Davout to check Bagration’s advance on Mohilev.]\r\n\r\nRaievski advanced from Dashkova at 6 a.m. on the 23rd. He had with him\r\nabout 17,000 men with 84 or 96 guns. His cavalry he left in reserve at\r\nNovo Sielki, 3 miles from Dashkova. He ordered Paskievich’s division\r\nto endeavour to turn the French right, promising that as soon as the\r\nattack made headway he would hurl Kolubakin’s division at Saltanovka.\r\n\r\nPaskievich, driving in the French skirmishers, fought his way across\r\nthe rivulet, and, bringing up a battery to cover his advance, pushed on\r\nagainst the 108th Regiment beyond it. Raievski, marking the advancing\r\nroll of Paskievich’s fire, believed that the time had come, and sent\r\nforward Kolubakin’s division. The Russians flung themselves at the\r\nbridge, drove off a battalion of the 85th which endeavoured to take\r\nthem in flank, and pressed doggedly on under a murderous fire which\r\nswept them away by platoons. Unable to advance, with the stolid courage\r\nof their race they refused to fall back, and stood facing the French\r\nvolleys until Raievski withdrew them.\r\n\r\nPaskievich’s leading troops, attacking Fatova, were charged and\r\nrepulsed across the stream by two battalions of the 108th under\r\nColonel Achard. Achard, in his turn, hotly pursuing, was driven back\r\nto his own side; and Paskievich, again advancing, carried Fatova, and\r\npenetrated almost to the outskirts of Selets; but his offensive power\r\nhad exhausted itself, and before the heavy fire of his well-posted\r\nand well-protected opponents he could advance no farther. Meanwhile\r\nRaievski, determined not to abandon his lieutenant, called up\r\nKolubakin’s reserves, and made another desperate attempt upon the\r\nbridge, himself and General Vassilchikov leading on foot, with reckless\r\nbravery. All was in vain; the splendid infantry went forward only to\r\ndie, and as the last attack reeled back from Friederichs’ front, an\r\naide-de-camp arrived to report Paskievich’s failure. It was now past\r\nfour o’clock, and Davout, feeling safe on his right, ordered forward\r\nCompans with the 61st and 111th Regiments and began a general advance.\r\nPrisoners told Raievski that Davout had about Mohilev 3 infantry and 2\r\ncavalry divisions, and, believing that he was opposed by overwhelming\r\nforces, he gave orders to retreat. Compans followed as far as Novo\r\nSielki, but as the road was practically a defile between woods he\r\ncould do nothing to seriously harass the Russian retreat, and Davout’s\r\nhandful of light cavalry was of course useless. Claparède and the heavy\r\nartillery reached Mohilev during the closing stages of the battle.\r\nRaievski at Dashkova was met by Bagration, and the latter, judging that\r\nthe way was barred by the bulk of Davout’s corps, decided to pass the\r\nDnieper and retreat on Smolensk.\r\n\r\nRaievski gave his loss as 2504 killed, wounded and missing. That of the\r\nFrench was naturally, under the conditions of the fighting, much less.\r\nDavout stated it at less than 900. General Desaix was slightly wounded.\r\nDavout was on worse terms with him than ever, and pointedly ignored him\r\nin his reports.\r\n\r\nBagration wrote to Barclay that he had failed to break through at\r\nMohilev, and so would make for Smolensk. On the 24th Platov and\r\nDorokhov--except one fatigued infantry regiment--forded the Dnieper\r\nat Verkalobovo, and pushed on to join Barclay. Raievski, supported\r\nby Voronzov, held firm at Dashkova. Borozdin went back to Staroi\r\nBykhov, while the pontooneers were sent on to bridge the Dnieper at\r\nNovi Bykhov, 14 miles farther south. On the 25th Borozdin marched\r\nfor the selected place of passage, and Raievski followed to Staroi\r\nBykhov, unpursued by Davout, who could not meddle with Sievers’ and\r\nVassilchikov’s squadrons. The Second Army crossed the Dnieper on\r\nthe 26th and 27th, and marched rapidly upon Mstislavl. On the same\r\nday Platov was in touch with Barclay, having passed the Dnieper at\r\nDubrovna on the 27th. Davout had remained practically inactive. He has\r\nbeen blamed for his inertness; but it must be remembered that he was\r\ninferior in numbers to Bagration. He had in hand only some 25,000 men,\r\nand his nearest reinforcement was the 5th Corps, which, harassed by\r\nfatigue, disease and lack of supplies, only reached the Berezina on the\r\n24th. On the 25th Bordesoulle reported that Bagration was bridging the\r\nDnieper, and on the same day Latour-Maubourg sent a detailed and fairly\r\naccurate statement of Bagration’s strength, which probably made Davout\r\nmore than ever inclined to caution. On the 27th Poniatowski’s leading\r\nbrigade was at last within reach, but on the same day Bordesoulle\r\nreported that Bagration was across the Dnieper. Whatever Davout might\r\nhave wished to attempt it was now too late. On the 29th Napoleon sent\r\norders for him to canton his three corps along the Dnieper.\r\n\r\nAs has been seen, the First Russian Army had concentrated at the\r\ncamp of Drissa, but it had scarcely arrived when proposals for its\r\nabandonment were made.\r\n\r\nThe Russian army can scarcely be said to have had a commander at\r\nthis moment. Clausewitz gives a graphic account of the disorder that\r\nprevailed. The Emperor was of course nominally the supreme head,\r\nand he was more or less at the mercy of his personal entourage. He\r\nhimself believed in Phull, but everyone else distrusted the Prussian\r\ntheorist--certainly not without good reason. The Tzar’s relations\r\noften exercised undue influence over him, and were distrusted and\r\ndisliked by the courtiers and soldiers; the courtiers were at odds\r\nwith the military men; finally, the native Russian officers were\r\njealous of the foreigners. Barclay himself was included among the\r\nobjects of their dislike, and Colonel von Wollzogen, one of his German\r\naides, was regarded with poisonous hatred, merely because his manners\r\nwere unpleasing! Projects of strategy were almost as numerous as\r\nadvisers. Count Lieven, late ambassador at Berlin, had there seen\r\nmuch of Scharnhörst, who considered that no attempt should be made to\r\nfight before reaching Smolensk. Barclay protested repeatedly against\r\nremaining at Drissa, and he was supported by the Tzar’s relative,\r\nAlexander of Württemberg. Paulucci, the chief-of-staff, declared\r\nfuriously that the man who had selected such a position could only be\r\neither a fool or a traitor, and resigned.\r\n\r\nThe camp of Drissa lay in a bend of the Düna between Drissa and\r\nBridzievo. Its land front was about 6500 yards in length, that on\r\nthe river about 8000. The land front had ten redoubts, connected by\r\nbatteries. In front of redoubts 6, 7, 8 and 9 was an abattis 2000\r\nyards long and 120 broad; but before the left wing a marshy wood gave\r\nexcellent cover to an attacking enemy. Two more redoubts strengthened\r\nthe first line of defence. The second was formed of five closed works,\r\nand another formed a kind of citadel behind it. Communication was\r\nmaintained with the right bank by four bridges, which had only just\r\nbeen constructed and were incompletely protected with outworks. The\r\nsubsidiary means of defence--pitfalls, palisades, entanglements and\r\nabattis--were also very incomplete. The stores were largely accumulated\r\nin wooden sheds in the village of Drissa, opposite the left wing and\r\nexposed to hostile fire.\r\n\r\nThese tactical defects were, however, slight as compared with the\r\nstrategic disadvantages. Lying far away from the Moscow road it could\r\nafford no defence against an enemy who chose to advance by that line,\r\nand it did not even cover that to St. Petersburg. The roads which led\r\nto it were mere country tracks, which ruined the convoys which had to\r\nuse them. Moreover, by retiring on Drissa the First Army had actually\r\nretreated away from, instead of towards, Bagration, and if the two\r\nseparated forces wished to effect a junction they could do so only by\r\nretiring far to the rear, or by perilous marches across the front of\r\nNapoleon’s advancing columns.\r\n\r\nAlexander, perhaps at Phull’s instigation, reprimanded Bagration for\r\nretreating, as if he could have done anything else. Finally, however,\r\nPhull was induced to give way, and it was decided, just in time, to\r\nevacuate Drissa. The 1st Corps was ordered to cover the St. Petersburg\r\nroad, and on July 14th the rest of the army began its march for Vitebsk.\r\n\r\nThe French advanced troops were already almost on the Düna. On the\r\n13th Oudinot with Legrand’s division made a somewhat unnecessary\r\ndemonstration against the bridge-head of Dünaburg. On the night of the\r\n14-15th Wittgenstein bridged the Düna and sent across a detachment\r\nunder Kulnev, which surprised St. Genies’ cavalry brigade, and captured\r\nthe brigadier and over 100 men. Meanwhile the First Army pursued its\r\nmarch, covered by the river, and reached Polotsk on the 18th.\r\n\r\nOn July 16th Napoleon left Vilna and on the 18th arrived at Glubokoïe.\r\nNext day, learning that Drissa was abandoned, he turned Eugène towards\r\nVitebsk, placed the cavalry of the 6th Corps under his orders, and\r\ncalled Grouchy also to join him. The 6th Corps was marching for\r\nGlubokoïe, already in a sad condition owing to heat, bad roads and\r\ndeficiency of bread. It should have received 70,000 bread rations at\r\nVilna, but so completely had the commissariat broken down that only\r\n27,000 could be furnished. Diarrhoea and dysentery had broken out; and\r\nthe unhappy Bavarians fell out in thousands, mostly to die untended by\r\nthe wayside.\r\n\r\nMurat’s three infantry divisions, under the general command of Comte\r\nLobau, were extended from Perebrod, 20 miles west of Drissa, towards\r\nthe south-east. Oudinot was approaching on the left. Ney and Nansouty\r\nwere near Desna, some 20 miles below Drissa.\r\n\r\nThe conditions among the leading troops were less pitiable than with\r\nthe 6th Corps, but still very bad. Supplies were scanty. Bread was\r\nscarce; the troops were lucky if they received even flour. Owing to\r\nthe breakdown of the transport clothing and equipment--especially\r\nfootgear--were becoming deficient. The roads were bad, the heat was\r\ngreat and there was much sickness. Lack of supplies led to a general\r\nslackening of the bonds of discipline. The country was ravaged by\r\nmarauding stragglers, who committed every kind of outrage. All efforts\r\nto check the evil failed completely.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th Barclay was at Polotsk. He rightly inferred that Napoleon\r\nwould direct his attacks against the Russian left, and informed\r\nAlexander that he must continue his retreat on Vitebsk. Fresh orders\r\nwere given to Wittgenstein; and the reserve troops at Dünaburg and\r\nelsewhere were placed under his command.\r\n\r\nAt Polotsk the Tzar left the army. It was a wise step, for he\r\nwas useless at the front, while at the seat of government his\r\npresence would be invaluable. Paulucci accompanied him, and was\r\nreplaced by Major-General Yermólov, while Colonel Toll became\r\nQuartermaster-General. On bidding farewell Alexander bade Barclay not\r\nto endanger his army, for it was the only one that Russia possessed.\r\nThis injunction undoubtedly made a strong impression upon Barclay, and\r\nis the best explanation of his irresolution some weeks later.\r\n\r\nOn July 20th Napoleon’s plan was definitely formed. He would turn\r\nBarclay’s left by throwing forward the Guard and the 4th and 6th Corps\r\nto Bechenkoviczi on the road to Vitebsk, while Murat and Ney contained\r\nthe Russians in front, and Oudinot occupied Drissa and threatened their\r\nright.\r\n\r\nBarclay, however, was already moving. On the 19th Uvarov’s cavalry\r\ncorps started from Polotsk, and by the 23rd the entire army was\r\ncollected round Vitebsk. There Barclay heard that Bagration had\r\nreached Mohilev, and wrote begging him to hasten his march on Orsha.\r\nHe sent Major-General Tuchkov IV with his infantry brigade, 3 cavalry\r\nregiments and 1 of Cossacks, towards Babinovichi on the Orsha road, and\r\nLieutenant-General Count Ostermann-Tolstoï, who had succeeded Shuvalov\r\n(retired through illness) with the 4th Corps, a brigade of Dragoons,\r\nand the Hussars of the Guard and of Sumi, towards Ostrovno on the way\r\nto Bechenkoviczi. The rest of the Russian army remained at Vitebsk to\r\nrest and reorganise.\r\n\r\nThe advance-guard of the French 4th Corps was already at Bechenkoviczi.\r\nOudinot had two divisions at Polotsk and the third at Drissa. Lobau\r\nwas to Eugène’s left rear, with Ney some 20 miles farther back: Murat,\r\nwith Nansouty’s corps, was near Bechenkoviczi; Montbrun was moving up\r\nthe right bank of the Düna towards Vitebsk; Napoleon with the Guard was\r\nat Kamen, about 21 miles from Bechenkoviczi. The unhappy 6th Corps was\r\ntoiling along the Glubokoïe-Polotsk road.\r\n\r\nAt 6 a.m. on the 25th Murat’s and Ostermann’s outposts collided near\r\nOstrovno. Here the road, coming from Vitebsk between woods, made a\r\nsharp turn to the right, and another equally abrupt to the left some\r\nway farther on. The leading Russian regiment, the Guard Hussars,\r\ncharged headlong and, sabring the French pickets, blundered up against\r\nPiré’s brigade in the rear. It was driven back with heavy loss upon\r\na horse battery which was following, and in the confusion the French\r\ncaptured six guns. Ostermann, who was some way behind, sent forward the\r\nSumi Hussars to check the French advance. He then formed for battle,\r\nwith Choglokov’s division deployed across the road and Bakhmetiev’s\r\nin columns behind, and in this order the 4th Corps marched forward to\r\nOstrovno, and took position between the woods.\r\n\r\nOstermann had in all 18 battalions and 20 squadrons--some 13,000 men\r\nand perhaps 60 guns. The French troops which could take part in the\r\naction included Bruyère’s and St. Germain’s cavalry divisions and\r\nDelzons’ infantry division--10,000 bayonets, 6000 lances and sabres,\r\nwith about 40 guns.\r\n\r\nOstermann proved a very poor tactician. Against infantry and artillery\r\nin position the French cavalry could do nothing, and until the head\r\nof Delzons’ division, the two battalions of the 8th Léger, arrived\r\nthe action was confined to some spectacular but useless cavalry\r\nskirmishing. When the 8th Léger came up it was attacked by three\r\nRussian battalions, which moved forward against it, but they were\r\ncharged in flank by two cavalry regiments and driven back. They should\r\nnot have been exposed alone in front of the position. Ostermann\r\nthen attacked both flanks of the French at once, but with only four\r\nbattalions, which were charged by the cavalry and broken. Delzons’\r\ndivision was now coming into action, and Ostermann withdrew to a\r\nposition two miles farther back. The action was certainly not to his\r\ncredit.\r\n\r\nBarclay on this day had sent Lieutenant-General Konovnitzin with\r\nhis division of the 3rd Corps (less Tuchkov IV’s brigade) and the\r\n1st Cavalry Corps to support his advanced guard. Early on the 26th\r\nOstermann retired behind Konovnitzin, who took up a defensive position\r\nbehind a ravine, with a wood on his left. At 10 a.m. Murat arrived in\r\nhis front with Delzons and Nansouty. Huard’s brigade (two regiments)\r\nwas directed against the Russian right, Roussel’s upon the left; the\r\n106th Regiment and Nansouty’s cavalry, except one brigade which covered\r\nthe left, remained in reserve.\r\n\r\nRoussel’s troops found much difficulty in penetrating the wood on\r\nthe Russian left and, assailed by Konovnitzin’s reserve, were driven\r\nout and over the ravine. The Russians, however, pursuing heedlessly,\r\nwere repulsed by a charge of one of Nansouty’s brigades; and Roussel,\r\nrallying his troops, penetrated into the wood. Huard, meanwhile, was\r\nsteadily pushing forward on the Russian right, and, being presently\r\nsupported by the 106th, gained ground rapidly. Konovnitzin drew off in\r\ngood order and retreated on Vitebsk, little harassed by the way, the\r\nbroken and wooded nature of the country greatly impeding the pursuit.\r\nNapoleon, wishing to deliver a general action at Vitebsk, directed\r\nEugène not to press too closely, lest Barclay should take alarm and\r\nretreat without fighting.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th Napoleon had near Ostrovno the Guard (less Claparède\r\nand Colbert), Lobau’s three divisions, the 3rd and 4th Corps, and\r\nNansouty’s and Montbrun’s cavalry, about 120,000 men in all. The 2nd\r\nCorps was at Drissa and Polotsk, in contact with Wittgenstein, and\r\nthe 6th at Uchach, 60 miles in rear of Ostrovno. During the night\r\nKonovnitzin had been joined by the corps commander, Tuchkov I, with\r\nStrogonov’s division; and the united force now retired on Vitebsk.\r\n\r\nBarclay had made up his mind to fight at Vitebsk. His reasons, as\r\ndetailed to the Tzar, were that Napoleon had in hand only the Guard,\r\nthe 3rd and 4th Corps, and Murat’s cavalry, while the steadiness of\r\nthe Russian troops in the recent fighting gave good hopes of victory;\r\nand that he felt it his duty to draw Napoleon’s attention upon him and\r\ngive Bagration time wherein to come up. As regards the first reason he\r\ndid not know that Napoleon had with him three divisions of Davout’s\r\ncorps, and was therefore 30,000 stronger than his estimate. Respecting\r\nthe second, if Bagration really were making the terribly dangerous\r\nmarch from Mohilev by Orsha and Babinovichi, Barclay was indeed bound\r\nto fight for the sake of his comrade. That the plan of attempting\r\na junction by way of Orsha was hazardous is clear, but it scarcely\r\naffects Barclay’s reasoning. On the assumption that Bagration was\r\ncoming by the Orsha road, and that Napoleon was only 90,000 strong, his\r\ndetermination was not unwise.\r\n\r\nThe Russian army was drawn up on the 27th behind the Luchizza, a stream\r\nflowing into the Düna just below Vitebsk. Clausewitz criticises the\r\nposition severely; but he seems rather prone to ignore the fact that\r\ngood tactical positions are not plentiful in Russia--as he himself\r\nelsewhere admits. Strategically it had the grave defect of lying almost\r\nparallel to the Orsha road by which communications with Bagration\r\nwere expected to be established. But it is at any rate certain that\r\nit would, like the faulty position of Eylau, have been defended\r\nwith desperate courage. An advance-guard of 8 battalions, 2 Cossack\r\nregiments and all the regular light cavalry was stationed on the left\r\nbank of the Luchizza, under General Pahlen, the commander of the 3rd\r\nCavalry Corps.\r\n\r\nThough the Russian army had suffered less than its opponents during the\r\nlong marches from the Niemen to Vitebsk it had not escaped considerable\r\nlosses by disease and fatigue. The reinforcements along the Düna had\r\nmostly been assigned to Wittgenstein. Platov and Dorokhov were also\r\nabsent. Barclay’s strength at Vitebsk appears to have been about\r\n82,000 men, of whom 14,000 were cavalry--mostly regulars--and over 400\r\nexcellently horsed guns.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th the French advance-guard moved upon Vitebsk, and there was\r\nsome brisk fighting between Pahlen’s detachment and Broussier’s and\r\nBruyère’s divisions. The Cossacks of the Russian Guard overthrew the\r\n16th Chasseurs-à-cheval, who endeavoured to stop them with carbine\r\nfire, and made a mad dash right among Broussier’s infantry squares,\r\nwhile some Voltigeurs of the 9th French Regiment, pushed across\r\nthe Luchizza, defended themselves brilliantly against a cloud of\r\nRussian horsemen. Pahlen steadily retired as the French advanced, and\r\nNapoleon did not wish to press, since his concentration would not be\r\ncomplete until the evening. Ney was still on the march from Ostrovno,\r\nand Montbrun on the other bank of the Düna opposite Vitebsk. In the\r\nafternoon Barclay received Bagration’s despatch announcing that he was\r\nmarching for Smolensk. Barclay at once issued orders for a retreat. In\r\nthe night the whole army, leaving its camp-fires burning, evacuated its\r\nposition and moved silently away in three columns, General Dokhturov,\r\nwith the 5th and 6th Corps, marching directly on Smolensk by way of\r\nRudnia, the rest of the army taking the more circuitous routes by\r\nSurazh and Poriechie. Dokhturov’s march was covered by a rear-guard,\r\nunder Major-General Shevich, that of the other two columns by Pahlen\r\nwith 14 battalions and 32 squadrons. The withdrawal from the position\r\nwas a triumph of good management and discipline. Scarce a single\r\nstraggler was left behind, and the retiring columns were well on their\r\nway before the fact of their departure was ascertained. The diverging\r\nlines of retreat confused the French cavalry, and not until the 30th\r\nwas Murat definitely able to report that Barclay had retreated on\r\nSmolensk. Except for some not very serious skirmishing between the\r\nadvanced guards of the French and the rear-guards of the Russians there\r\nwas no fighting. The Russians moved at a pace which set pursuit at\r\ndefiance. On July 31st Dokhturov was outside Smolensk, having marched\r\n80 miles in four days. On August 1st Barclay arrived from Poriechie.\r\nBagration, hurrying from Novi Bykhov by Propoïsk and Mstistavl, came up\r\ntwo days later. His troops had covered 150 miles through sands, bogs\r\nand forests in eight days. The pedestrian feats of the Russians are\r\nremarkable. Since June 28 the Second Army had marched over 540 miles,\r\ngiving an average of 15 miles a day. As there were some days of rest or\r\nbattle the actual pace was much more rapid.\r\n\r\nThe Russian losses in the fighting round Vitebsk may be estimated at\r\nabout 4000, with 6 (or 8) guns. Those of the French may have been a\r\nlittle less.\r\n\r\nNapoleon entered Vitebsk on the 28th. He must have been bitterly\r\ndisappointed at the negative result of his operations. Once more\r\nthe Russians had quietly withdrawn out of reach at the very moment\r\nof contact. The French losses through fatigue and disease had been\r\nrelatively enormous, and the manoeuvre of Vitebsk had failed as\r\ncompletely as the manoeuvre at Vilna. In a sense the failure was\r\neven worse, for the Russians had emerged from the situation with a\r\ngreat strategic success to their credit. In spite of blunders and\r\nmiscalculation, despite contradictory orders and lack of any unity of\r\ncommand, Barclay and Bagration had achieved what had been the primary\r\nobject of their weary marches and manoeuvres to the rear, and had\r\neffected their union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE OPERATIONS ABOUT SMOLENSK\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the arrival of Napoleon’s main army on the Düna and Dnieper the\r\nfirst stage of the campaign came to an end. To all appearance the\r\ninvaders had gained immense advantages. Nearly the whole of the ancient\r\nDuchy of Lithuania, together with most of Kurland, had passed into\r\nNapoleon’s hands almost without a blow having been struck in their\r\ndefence. A number of considerable towns had been occupied, and a great\r\nquantity of Russian stores captured. The Russian armies, which six\r\nweeks earlier had been ranged along the line of the Bug and the Niemen,\r\nhad now retreated behind that formed by the Düna and the Dnieper, and\r\nthe passage of both these rivers could be effected by the French at\r\ntheir convenience. The Russian troops, apart from the discouragement\r\ncaused by constant retreating, had suffered considerable material loss.\r\n\r\nWhen the withdrawal from the frontier began the armies of Barclay and\r\nBagration had numbered together some 174,000 men. On the Düna the\r\nFirst Army had been joined by about 9000 reserves, and at Smolensk by\r\n17 depôt battalions and 4 batteries of artillery--probably 6000 more.\r\nBagration had incorporated in his army the garrison of Mohilev and\r\nsix reserve battalions from Bobruisk--say 3000. These figures, added\r\ntogether, give a total of 192,000.\r\n\r\nOn August 6th the Russian forces were as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe First and Second Armies presented a total of 121,000 men; besides\r\na detachment of 1 Dragoon and 3 Cossack regiments detached towards\r\nPoriechie. Three regiments of Cossacks had been detached to Riga and\r\nelsewhere. Two of Raievski’s infantry regiments, which had been the\r\nworst sufferers at Saltanovka, had been sent into the interior to\r\nrecruit. The deduction under these headings may be fairly estimated\r\nat 4500 men. Wittgenstein’s corps and the reserves from Drissa and\r\nDünaburg were on July 12th over 28,500 strong. The total effective\r\nof the Russian First and Second Armies early in August was therefore\r\n154,000, showing a deficiency since June of 38,000 men. The fighting\r\nround Mohilev and Vitebsk had scarcely cost more than 6000 or 7000\r\nmen, and 5000 is a high estimate for losses in the rear-guard actions.\r\nThe diminution from other causes was therefore 27,000. It is to be\r\naccounted for by sickness, by straggling and fatigue due to the long\r\nand painful marches, but also in large measure to desertion among the\r\nLithuanian troops. These half-hearted men were probably no great loss,\r\nnor can it be said that the diminution was, on the whole, excessive;\r\nstill it was serious. Over and above the abandoned magazines a portion\r\nof the material had been lost. Only eight guns had been captured in\r\naction, but some thirty more had been abandoned during the long marches\r\nthrough sands, swamps and forests; it says volumes for the Russian\r\nartillery that the number was not greater.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the Russian losses had been serious, those of the French\r\nhad been more so. The causes which diminished the strength of the\r\nRussians operated also against the invaders, and apparently the latter,\r\nfor the most part used to a higher standard of living, were less able\r\nto endure hardships. Fatigue and heat might have been endured without\r\nany very serious results, but owing to the breakdown of the transport,\r\nthe supplies of bread and biscuit could never keep up with the troops;\r\neven flour was rarely to be had. Meat was, as a rule, not lacking,\r\nbut it was often of bad quality, the cattle being overdriven and\r\nfrequently themselves ill-fed. A diet of poor meat, unseasoned, and\r\nunaccompanied by bread or vegetables, is not suitable for men who have\r\nto endure hard labour and fatigue under the rays of a Russian midsummer\r\nsun. Such bread and biscuit as were procurable were bad, and the\r\nill-ground rye had serious effects upon the stomachs of men accustomed\r\nto well-prepared wheaten flour. Every effort was made to bring up\r\nadequate supplies, but the ill-fed and over-worked draft beasts were\r\nutterly unable to cope with the transport, and died in great numbers.\r\nThe men, foraging for themselves, were rarely able to obtain more than\r\nsmall quantities of grain, and as there were no portable mills in\r\nthe equipment of the troops it had to be consumed boiled. The water\r\navailable in Lithuania was scanty in quantity and often bad; and in\r\nthe general disorganisation of the commissariat brandy, which formed\r\npart of the usual ration, and might, at any rate, have done something\r\ntowards rendering the water less unwholesome, was rarely served out.\r\nThe result was a frightful amount of sickness--diarrhoea, dysentery and\r\ntyphus--and in a wretchedly poor and sparsely populated region little\r\ncould be done to reduce it. The sick were left behind in temporary\r\nhospital camps; where they died by thousands in the midst of filth,\r\nstarvation and general destitution. Of those who went into these dens\r\nof misery it was calculated that not one in ten ever emerged alive.\r\n\r\nThe fighting line was seriously weakened by the immense number of sick.\r\nIt was also reduced by the necessity of making large detachments to\r\nbring up the belated supply trains and to forage for bread, and yet\r\nfurther depleted by straggling, partly for purposes of foraging, partly\r\nowing to fatigue, and in some measure to indiscipline. This straggling\r\nhad always been one of the bad features of the Napoleonic army, and the\r\nmarches always appear, except when in face of the enemy, to have been\r\nconducted with great irregularity. A German eyewitness was amazed to\r\nsee the regiments of Davout’s corps, the best disciplined of the army,\r\nmaking a short march in the most disorderly array.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, something to be said for this permission to\r\nthe men to take their ease when there was no necessity for precise\r\nformation and watchfulness; and certainly nothing is ever gained\r\nby harassing and overworking soldiers distinguished for cheerful\r\nreadiness--as Frenchmen have always been. But it is difficult to avoid\r\nthe conclusion that the irregularity went beneath the surface. With\r\nthe gaiety and readiness of the French nature is intermixed a decided\r\nstrain of impatience under restraint which easily degenerates into\r\nlawlessness. The straggling which, in earlier days, had perhaps been\r\nnecessary for the ill-compacted Revolutionary armies, had now become\r\na habit, and soon developed into a monstrous abuse, which ultimately,\r\nas much as anything, proved the ruin of the army. The writer is far\r\nfrom wishing to defend a hard and inelastic discipline which crushes\r\npersonal initiative. But he is strongly of opinion that had the French\r\nmarch discipline been better at the outset, the army would not have\r\nbroken up as it did during the retreat. Upon this subject more will be\r\nsaid in its proper place.\r\n\r\nFinally, it must be observed that the proper means of checking\r\nthe evils which afflicted the contending armies were very little\r\nunderstood. Not only was there a deficiency of trained _personnel_,\r\nbut the medical art was, as compared with what it is to-day, in a\r\nvery undeveloped condition. It cannot be said that Napoleon did not\r\nendeavour to provide his troops with medical and surgical assistance,\r\nbut it was never adequate, either in quantity or quality. The\r\nofficers were rarely qualified to make good the deficiencies of the\r\nsanitary services. Among the corps commanders there were certainly\r\nsome who thoroughly understood the details of administration. Davout\r\nwas undoubtedly the best of them; but Ney was also a careful and\r\nconscientious administrator. As early as August he is found issuing\r\norders for the preparation of winter clothing. Among the divisional\r\nleaders, also, there were some who thoroughly understood how to look\r\nafter their men--De Fezensac instances Ledru des Essarts as one of\r\nthem. Still, the careful administrators were certainly in a minority,\r\nand their excellent intentions were often hampered by lack of\r\nscientific knowledge.\r\n\r\nTurning from the general examination of these evils to consideration\r\nof the intrinsic damage which they caused, it is to be noted that the\r\n1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 8th Army Corps and the 4 corps of\r\nReserve Cavalry totalled on June 24th about 315,000 men. The returns\r\nof August 3rd and 4th give an aggregate of less than 213,000. There\r\nwere, therefore, even on the showing of the official returns, 102,000\r\nmen in rear. Detachments account for about 20,000. There remain 82,000;\r\nand, since allowance must be made for drafts and absentees rejoined, it\r\nwill probably be fair to estimate that the losses amounted to 100,000.\r\nThe loss in battle cannot be estimated higher than 15,000; it follows\r\nthat 85,000 men had disappeared from the muster-rolls by reason of\r\nstraggling and sickness--that is, nearly 30 per cent. Of course, they\r\nwere not all permanently lost to the army, but a very large proportion\r\nwere, owing to the terrible lack of provision for the temporarily\r\ndisabled soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe mortality among the horses had been very large, mainly owing to\r\nlack of forage. The number dwindled day by day, and this circumstance\r\nwas, in a sense, more fatal than loss of men. Every disabled horse\r\nmeant further lessening of the means of transport. The cavalry\r\nregiments were unable to mount even their diminished effectives except\r\nby sweeping up horses from the countryside; and these were rarely of\r\nmuch service. The guns of the reserve parks had to be left at Vilna,\r\nand even part of the artillery of several army corps.\r\n\r\nWhen Napoleon reached Vitebsk the number of men missing among the\r\n450,000 who had crossed the frontier in June and July, may be\r\nconservatively calculated at 120,000, and a very large proportion\r\nof them were either already dead or disabled from further service.\r\nStraggling and desertion were especially prevalent among the foreign\r\nregiments. Their administration was generally less efficient; less\r\ncare was taken of them by the French officials. They had naturally\r\nlittle affection for the cause in which they had been enlisted by\r\ntheir sovereigns, and their officers must have been exasperated at\r\nthe disgraceful fashion in which Napoleon invariably endeavoured to\r\nsaddle their troops with the sole blame for disorders. It is more than\r\nprobable that disgust at this, no less than the way in which they had\r\nbeen sacrificed, was one of the motives which impelled so many German\r\nofficers to turn against Napoleon in the following year.\r\n\r\nFor every reason a halt was imperatively necessary, and Napoleon called\r\nit as soon as the escape of the First Russian Army was an accomplished\r\nfact. On the 29th he wrote to Davout, ordering him to canton his\r\ntroops. The various corps took up quarters on a line extending from\r\nSurazh to beyond Mohilev, with the cavalry pushed out in front and on\r\nthe flanks. Latour-Maubourg was about Rogachev-on-Dnieper, some 60\r\nmiles south of Mohilev, with a Polish infantry division in support.\r\n\r\nThere was a little skirmishing between the advanced French cavalry and\r\nbelated Russian detachments. On July 30th Murat’s horsemen picked up\r\nabout 100 prisoners and 40 abandoned vehicles, and captured a welcome\r\nsupply of flour and forage. On the 31st Villata’s Italian cavalry\r\nbrigade surprised a Russian convoy at Velizh, escorted by 4 depôt\r\nbattalions. The 2nd Chasseurs under Colonel Banco charged, and captured\r\n60 waggons and 250 prisoners. The total Russian loss was estimated by\r\nEugène at 700, and 600 sacks of flour and a herd of bullocks fell into\r\nthe hands of the Italian troopers. But for these captures the French\r\ncavalry could hardly have advanced another step. The regiments were,\r\nwith few exceptions, very weak, and the horses exhausted by fatigue\r\nand privation. Sebastiani--perhaps with some exaggeration, for he was\r\nill and discouraged--declared that his division had only 2300 mounted\r\nmen remaining, out of over 4000. Hardly one of the corps was really\r\nfit for service except perhaps the 1st. Ney had not yet received his\r\nreserve of artillery, which was toiling up from the rear. Not even in\r\nthe 1st Corps were things altogether satisfactory. Davout was growling\r\nat the disorder in the regiments, threatening Desaix, whom he accused\r\nof abetting it, with arrest, and re-establishing discipline by stern\r\nmethods, including the shooting of marauders caught in the act.\r\n\r\nDuring the last days of July Oudinot had fought several very bloody and\r\ninconclusive actions with Wittgenstein. The 2nd Corps had been forced\r\nback upon the Düna; and on August 4th Napoleon ordered St. Cyr, who\r\nwas near Bechenkoviczi, to march to its support, though the unhappy\r\nBavarians had scarcely begun to refit and were still smitten with\r\ndisease. St. Cyr complained bitterly, but he had to obey.\r\n\r\nBy August 4th the Grand Army had settled down in cantonments.\r\nHead-quarters were at Vitebsk, where ovens were being built, and\r\nhospitals and magazines established. The 4th Corps was at Surazh,\r\nVelizh and Poriechie, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Cavalry Corps about Rudnia,\r\nthe 3rd Corps around Liozna, north-west of Rudnia, with the 24th Light\r\nInfantry supporting Sebastiani. The 1st Corps, not yet reunited, was\r\nspread from Vitebsk to Orsha, with the 8th Corps at the latter place,\r\nand the 5th between Sklov and Mohilev, whither Latour-Maubourg was also\r\nmoving.\r\n\r\nThe general results of the halt were very beneficial. The\r\nestablishments of the regiments began to rise. It is true that the\r\nmuster rolls for August 4th only show about 197,000 men present out\r\nof a nominal 270,000, but stragglers were rallying each day; and men\r\nand horses were at least reposing from fatigue. The supply department\r\nwas not entirely satisfactory. Davout’s troops were able to draw\r\nbreadstuffs from the country along the Dnieper, and had, as has been\r\nseen, captured several Russian depôts. The corps north of the Dnieper,\r\nhowever, depended for bread mainly on what could be brought up by the\r\nover-worked transport from Vilna and Minsk. Here, however, there was an\r\nimprovement, since the halt allowed the trains to close up. If bread\r\nwere not regularly served out the men at any rate obtained something,\r\nand the corps commanders were able to begin to accumulate a small\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\nBesides the increase caused by stragglers and convalescents rejoining,\r\nreinforcements were arriving. The rear detachments of the Imperial\r\nGuard were beginning to come up, also the Hesse-Darmstadt Guards, under\r\nPrince Emil, of which one battalion joined at Vitebsk, while the other\r\nwas marching from Vilna. Three newly formed battalions for the Vistula\r\nLegion were also on the way, and various _régiments de marche_ (i.e.\r\ndrafts, convalescents, etc.). A Portuguese cavalry regiment had joined\r\nDavout, and the Grand Quarter-General, 4690 strong, reached Vitebsk on\r\nthe 7th. When hostilities recommenced the Grand Army was considerably\r\nthe better for its rest. Davout’s troops especially were in excellent\r\norder, and carried on the person bread, biscuit and flour for fifteen\r\ndays. The Westphalians also were well supplied. North of the Dnieper\r\nmatters were less satisfactory. Friant on rejoining Davout stated that\r\nhe had always had to forage for breadstuffs, though he had plenty of\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\nThe administration of the hospitals was still very bad, even at\r\nVitebsk; and elsewhere no doubt it was much worse. Matters were not\r\nimproved by the fact that Surgeon-General Larrey and General Mathieu\r\nDumas, the chief of the military administration, were on bad terms with\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nSome changes were at this time made in the commands. Napoleon’s old,\r\nbut not very capable or energetic, friend, Junot, was appointed to the\r\ncommand of the 8th Corps. Marchand was given the Württemberg division\r\nof Ney’s corps. It had been commanded at the outset by the Crown\r\nPrince Wilhelm, but, partly owing to disgust at the disorder, and the\r\nfashion in which he and his men were slandered to save the faces of the\r\nFrench, partly owing to illness, he had returned to Vilna, leaving the\r\ncommand to Lieutenant-General Scheler. Marchand declined to take the\r\ndirect control out of the hands of the latter, and the two worked well\r\ntogether. Otherwise, being an old comrade and subordinate, Marchand was\r\nprobably welcome to Ney.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis d’Alorna, one of the few Portuguese officers who had\r\npreferred to serve Napoleon willingly, was appointed Military Governor\r\nof Mohilev. General Charpentier was placed in charge of Vitebsk, and\r\nGomès Freyre, another Portuguese, of Glubokoïe. The two brigades of\r\nBavarian light cavalry belonging to the 6th Corps were combined into a\r\ndivision, under General Graf von Preising, and transferred to the 4th\r\nCorps, which now had 36 squadrons.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, of course, did not intend the halt to be more than temporary.\r\nAt the outset of the campaign he had told Metternich that he did not\r\nintend to go farther than Smolensk in 1812, but, having established\r\nhimself there, purposed to organise Lithuania and consolidate his rule\r\nin the former Polish provinces before attempting to conquer Russia\r\nProper. This statement he repeated to others--notably to Jomini--and\r\nit can hardly be considered as a mere blind. Up to the present he had\r\nfailed to strike a heavy blow at the opposing Russian army The extent\r\nof country which he occupied was by no means an advantage, since it\r\nwas too poor to support his huge forces, and merely lengthened his\r\nalready long line of communications. But now, at last, a battle might\r\nreasonably be expected. Barclay and Bagration had united their forces,\r\nand it was scarcely within the bounds of probability that Smolensk,\r\na home of the ancient Rurikovich line, long contended for with hated\r\nPoland, one of the sacred cities of Russia, would be abandoned without\r\nfighting. The halt had for its primary object the putting of the army\r\ninto good condition preparatory to a fresh and energetic advance.\r\n\r\nAs early as August 6th Napoleon told Eugène that an early renewal of\r\nhostilities was to be anticipated, and that he should probably advance\r\non Smolensk by the left bank of the Dnieper. On the same day he was\r\nasking Davout for information as to which bank of the river was in\r\nhis opinion the better for the advance. Davout’s reply was that upon\r\nthe whole he thought the left bank the more suitable, and apparently\r\nthis decided the Emperor. The merits and demerits of the plan will\r\nbe discussed later. Here it is only necessary to observe that it was\r\npreconceived, and not due to the influence of Russian operations.\r\n\r\nThe two Russian armies were concentrated at Smolensk by August 4th.\r\nThe city had practically no fortifications of value. Its massive brick\r\nwalls were capable of resisting the attack of field guns, but there\r\nwere several ill-closed breaches; and the only guns in the place were\r\nantique pieces without carriages, kept mainly as relics. Smolensk\r\nwas garrisoned by a column of 17 depôt battalions, 8 squadrons and 4\r\nbatteries of artillery--about 6000 or 7000 men--which had been brought\r\nfrom Kaluga by General Winzingerode. The infantry was drafted into the\r\ntwo armies, ten battalions going to the 1st, seven to the 2nd, which\r\nhad dwindled during its forced marches, and needed more strengthening\r\nin proportion. The artillery was also divided, but the squadrons\r\nwere sent back to Kaluga to serve as a nucleus for fresh formations.\r\nWinzingerode was sent with the Kazan Dragoons from Uvarov’s division\r\nand 3 regiments of Cossacks to observe the French left wing towards\r\nSurazh and Poriechie. There then remained a held army of 121,000 men,\r\nof whom over 18,000 were regular cavalry, with some 650 pieces of\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\nUnhappily there was no unity of command. Barclay, as minister of\r\nwar, was the hierarchical chief, but both Bagration and himself\r\nwere Generals of Infantry, and the former was the senior in rank.\r\nThough a Georgian by birth he posed as an ultra Russian and received\r\naccordingly the willing, not to say eager and unscrupulous, support of\r\nthe many officers who chose to regard Barclay as a half-hearted and\r\neven treacherous foreigner. His fighting record was a good one, and he\r\nmight, with some justice, consider that he had the better title to the\r\ncommand-in-chief. Barclay also, with all his fine qualities, appears\r\nto have been deficient in tact. He does not appear to have fully\r\nrealised the difficulties with which Bagration had had to contend, nor\r\nthe very creditable attempts which he had made to effect a junction.\r\nAfter crossing the Dnieper Bagration appears to have considered that\r\nhis best service would be performed in operating upon Napoleon’s\r\nflank. Von Wollzogen, sent to urge him to hasten the union of the two\r\narmies, found him, according to his own account, by no means willing\r\nto do so, and informed Barclay. The latter thereupon wrote pressing\r\nhim to hasten, in phrases which, though hardly beyond what the urgency\r\nof the case required, were perhaps unjust in their implications, and\r\nwere certainly fiercely resented by Bagration. He reached Smolensk in\r\na frame of mind which would find cause of offence in every trifle.\r\nBarclay, however, displayed unusual tact, for which his aide-de-camp\r\nLöwenstern gives himself the credit. When Bagration came to report\r\nhimself the War-Minister met him in his antechamber in full uniform,\r\nand expressed his regret that he had been anticipated in calling upon\r\nhim. The two chiefs then had a conversation, as the result of which\r\nBarclay apologised by letter for any injustice which he might have\r\ndone his colleague. For the moment good relations were established,\r\nand Barclay wrote to the Tzar expressing his admiration of Bagration’s\r\ncharacter. But it is to be feared that Bagration’s friendly feelings\r\nwere of no very long continuance, and a sense of injury still rankled\r\nin his mind. What was worse, many of the general officers were almost\r\nopenly intriguing for the definite appointment of Bagration to the\r\nsupreme command. Yermólov actually wrote to the Tzar urging him to\r\nmake it. The chief of the malcontents was the Grand Duke Constantine,\r\nwho, as the Tzar’s brother and heir apparent, was the most important\r\ncommander in the army. Constantine was a violent and irrational person,\r\nbearing, both in disposition and in the exceeding ugliness of his\r\nfeatures, a strong resemblance to his ill-fated father. Barclay’s\r\nposition rapidly became almost an intolerable one.\r\n\r\nFor the moment all went well. A council was called for the 6th of\r\nAugust, and to it came the two commanders-in-chief, the Grand Duke\r\nConstantine, whom Barclay dared not omit, Yermólov, Toll and St.\r\nPriest, Bagration’s French chief-of-staff. The decision as to an\r\noffensive had been taken before the meeting, and only the details\r\nwere to be settled. There was naturally considerable divergence of\r\nopinion. The extension of the French cantonments appeared to afford\r\nan excellent opportunity. It was determined to throw strong forces\r\nagainst Napoleon’s extreme left, under Eugène, which might perhaps be\r\ncompletely destroyed. Bagration, however, wished to drive the attack\r\nhome with the full force of both armies, and to this Barclay would not\r\nagree. He was very naturally uneasy as to what the mighty conqueror\r\nopposed to him might do to turn the tables. Smolensk, weak as it was,\r\nwas the pivot of the Russian operations, and its loss would shatter\r\nthe entire strategic plan. Barclay therefore proposed that Bagration\r\nshould hold it while the First Army pushed forward against Vitebsk.\r\nTo this Bagration demurred, and eventually it was decided to leave\r\nonly a detachment to cover the city and to march upon Vitebsk with the\r\ncombined armies, the Second holding rather back on the left to guard\r\nagainst a turning movement.\r\n\r\nBarclay, however, was very uneasy. The Tzar had bidden him preserve\r\nhis army at all hazards, and, though he underestimated Napoleon’s\r\nstrength, it was no light thing to advance to the attack of so terrible\r\nan adversary. Sir Robert Wilson, the British military commissioner,\r\nwho reached head-quarters a few days later, says that Barclay was\r\nterrorised by his opponent’s renown, but, seeing the situation and\r\nthe tremendous consequences which would ensue on the destruction of\r\nRussia’s single formidable army, it can hardly be wondered that he\r\nwas resolute to take no risks. He informed the Council of Alexander’s\r\nwords, and expressed his firm determination not to move more than three\r\nmarches from Smolensk.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, possible to argue that the plan, thus confined, was\r\nbut a half-measure; but it is equally possible that Barclay’s caution\r\nsaved the Russian army from destruction. He was certainly so far\r\ndominated by Napoleon that he expected to be turned, and prepared to\r\nthrow back his right wing at the first alarm. On the other hand, it was\r\ncertain that if Napoleon pursued his usual strategy he would endeavour\r\nto turn one or the other of the Russian flanks, and probability pointed\r\nto the right.\r\n\r\nGeneral Neverovski was left to guard Smolensk. His division was\r\nimproved in quality by making over two regiments to Paskievich, and\r\nreceiving in return those of Poltava and Ladoga. The Kharkov Dragoon\r\nregiment and three regiments of Cossacks were also attached to him,\r\nand he was directed to move out along the left bank of the Dnieper.\r\n\r\nHaving thus, as he hoped, provided for speedy intelligence, and for the\r\nsecurity of Smolensk, if it were threatened, Barclay, on August 7th,\r\nset his forces in motion. Bagration moved along the right bank of the\r\nDnieper to Katan, some 16 miles from Smolensk. The 5th and 6th Corps\r\nand the 3rd Cavalry Corps advanced on Rudnia, and the 2nd, 3rd and 4th\r\nCorps and the rest of the cavalry in the direction of Poriechie. A\r\ndetachment of light infantry under Baron Rosen connected the First and\r\nSecond Armies. Each column was preceded by an advance guard of infantry\r\nand cavalry, and in front of all were the Cossacks under the general\r\ncommand of Platov. The advancing army totalled about 113,000 men.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first day’s march, Barclay received intelligence from\r\nWinzingerode that Eugène and Nansouty were at or near Poriechie. This\r\nnaturally suggested that Napoleon had obtained information, and was\r\nmoving to turn the Russian right. Barclay accordingly halted, and faced\r\nto the north-east, requesting Bagration to advance to Prikaz Vidra, 16\r\nmiles north of Katan, to guard the left flank. Platov was still moving\r\nnorth-westward, and on the 8th he encountered Sebastiani’s division\r\nnear Inkovo, east of Rudnia. Sebastiani was supported by the 24th\r\nLéger and Beurmann’s light cavalry brigade from Ney’s corps. Beurmann,\r\nhowever, hardly showed the vigour which the occasion required, and only\r\nhis Württemberg horse artillery battery took a decided share in the\r\naction, the brunt of which fell upon Sebastiani. The French division,\r\nwhich was less than 3000 strong, fought well, but was forced to fall\r\nback before superior numbers. A company of the 24th was captured by\r\nthe Cossacks, and the loss probably totalled 600 men, of whom 300 were\r\nprisoners. Murat was at head-quarters during the action, and by some\r\nthe reverse is attributed to his absence. Undoubtedly he would have\r\nbeen better able to combine the operations of Sebastiani and Beurmann\r\nthan was his chief-of-staff, Belliard, and would also have brought\r\npressure to bear upon Ney. The latter, who was cantoned about Liozna,\r\nconcentrated his troops, but made no move to Sebastiani’s support, for\r\nwhich he was next day severely reprimanded by Napoleon.\r\n\r\nOn the same day Nansouty’s outposts near Velizh were attacked by those\r\nof Winzingerode. The intelligence all went to show that the Russians\r\nwere advancing against the French left wing. On the 8th Napoleon\r\nreceived Davout’s report upon the roads along the Dnieper; and at\r\n2 a.m. on the 9th he replied to say that he had decided to march\r\nupon Smolensk by the left bank, and ordered the Marshal to trace the\r\nitinerary. Murat hurried to the front to resume his command. Ney drew\r\ntowards him the three divisions of the 1st Corps to meet a Russian\r\nadvance. On the 8th the Guard had been paid, and had received brandy\r\nfor ten days. Friant, who was to fall at the head of the Old Guard\r\non the field of Waterloo, was nominated Colonel-General of the Foot\r\nGrenadiers in place of General Dorsenne, recently deceased. He was\r\nwelcomed at a parade on the 9th by Napoleon himself--much to his\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th General Eblé was sent to Rasasna, 22 miles above Orsha,\r\nwith orders to throw four bridges over the Dnieper. The weather was\r\nvery bad, with heavy rain, which broke up the roads and impeded\r\nthe march of the troops. Nansouty’s and Montbrun’s cavalry (except\r\nSebastiani’s division), Ney’s corps, and the divisions of Morand,\r\nFriant and Gudin, were directed on Rasasna. Eugène would follow,\r\nforming the rear-guard of the movement, which was covered on its left\r\nby extensive forests. Davout’s army was also ordered on Rasasna, except\r\nDombrowski’s division, which was to remain near Mohilev to observe\r\nBobruisk. It is characteristic of Napoleon’s methods that Ney knew\r\nnothing of the proposed movement until late on the 10th. On the 11th\r\nthe Guard left Vitebsk. The weather was still bad, and it was probably\r\nowing to this that Ney was unable to evacuate all his sick, earning\r\nthereby another reprimand from Napoleon.\r\n\r\nGeneral Charpentier was left to garrison Vitebsk with the new Guard\r\nregiment of “Flanqueurs-Chasseurs,” Guyon’s cavalry brigade of the\r\n4th Corps, the 3rd battalion of the 1st Vistula Regiment, and a\r\nHesse-Darmstadt battalion on the way from Vilna--3800 men in all, a\r\nnumber which would be increased by the 16th to over 7000 by various\r\n_bataillons de marche_. Sebastiani’s division, temporarily commanded by\r\nGeneral Pajol, was to remain in observation near Rudnia. Dombrowski’s\r\ndivision was between Rogachev and Mohilev. A battalion of Westphalians\r\ngarrisoned Orsha. Deducting these detachments, Napoleon had available\r\nfor the advance on Smolensk over 200,000 men, exclusive of the\r\nhead-quarter troops. By the 13th the whole huge mass was either at or\r\nwithin easy reach of Rasasna, and Nansouty, Montbrun and Ney crossed\r\nthe river and took the lead.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat remarkable that there is no indication during this\r\nperiod of any attempt to ascertain the whereabouts of the Russians.\r\nNapoleon knew that they had not pushed their advance on Vitebsk, but he\r\nwas apparently so confident that his move would meet all emergencies\r\nthat he does not seem to have troubled himself about the 120,000\r\nenemies who were somewhere to his left.\r\n\r\nBarclay, as has been seen, was facing towards Poriechie. About this\r\ntime he received a direct order from Alexander to take the offensive.\r\nBagration moved to Prikaz Vidra on the 9th; and Barclay reported that\r\nthe two armies could concentrate in a day if necessary, that in their\r\nposition they covered Smolensk and the country between the Düna and\r\nDnieper, and could easily be supplied from the magazines which had\r\nbeen prepared beforehand at Toropetz and other places.\r\n\r\nBagration, however, was not satisfied. He was in a mood which would\r\nprobably have induced him to quarrel with anything that Barclay did. He\r\ntold Arakcheiev that the War-Minister’s head-quarters were so choked\r\nwith Germans that a Russian could not live there, and that constant\r\nmarching and counter-marching would drive him mad. To Yermólov he wrote\r\nthat he had neither hay, straw, bread nor a position, and that Barclay\r\nmust either do something or else supersede him (Bagration). He expected\r\nthat Napoleon would amuse them by demonstrations about Rudnia, and move\r\non Smolensk by their left. It is not clear whether this anticipation of\r\nthe French Emperor’s intentions was the result of careful reflection,\r\nor simply due to the natural tendency of every commander to imagine\r\nhimself the especial object of the enemy’s attentions.\r\n\r\nThe result was that Barclay, in despair, gave Bagration a free hand. He\r\nempowered him to withdraw upon Smolensk if he judged it necessary, and\r\nin general to take his own measures for the protection of the Russian\r\nleft flank. The unfortunate War-Minister was beset by open and secret\r\nfoes, and this, added to the responsibility which weighed upon him,\r\nprobably explains this extraordinary step, which practically amounted\r\nto an abdication of the supreme command.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th, accordingly, Bagration withdrew towards Smolensk. On the\r\nsame day, however, Barclay received fresh information that the French\r\nwere in force near Poriechie. It was absolutely baseless, but he could\r\nscarcely discredit it, more especially as he was obsessed by the idea\r\nof an attack from that quarter. He wrote to Bagration that he expected\r\nan attack on the 15th, and took up a position between the Kasplia lake\r\nand the village of Volokovaia, about 22 miles north-west of Smolensk.\r\nHe called up Bagration to Katan and Nadva, about 8 miles farther\r\nnorth-west, in order to guard his own left. On the 13th the Second Army\r\nwas retiring on Smolensk, and the 7th Corps had actually reached the\r\nplace when Barclay’s order of recall arrived.\r\n\r\nThis seems almost to have disturbed Bagration’s mental balance. He\r\ncomplained bitterly of the constant counter-marching, which was\r\nsteadily exhausting and depleting the Second Army. For this there was\r\ngood excuse, but little for the violent letters which he wrote to\r\nYermólov, in which he describes Barclay as a traitor worthy of death.\r\nThe latter had certainly carried his cautious policy too far, since\r\nanother march in advance on the 9th or 10th would have shown that there\r\nwere no large forces in his front, and he was certainly in a state of\r\ngreat irresolution. Still, seeing the character of his adversary, this\r\nwas, at any rate, excusable, and one may fairly ask why the masses of\r\nRussian light cavalry had not better enlightened the situation.\r\n\r\nIt must be said in defence of Bagration that however much he allowed\r\nhis fiery temperament to master him, and though his letters to a\r\ndangerous intriguer like Yermólov were subversive of all military\r\nsubordination, he did not himself set the example of disobedience. On\r\nthe 14th he counter-marched the 8th Corps on Katan, pushing Sievers’\r\nand Vassilchikov’s cavalry, with a supporting brigade of the 7th Corps,\r\non towards Volokovaia. The bulk of the 7th Corps was at Smolensk,\r\nand the men needed rest, so that Raievski did not commence his march\r\nuntil 7 p.m. As he moved off, cannonading was heard in the direction\r\nof Krasnoï. Towards 10 o’clock an aide-de-camp arrived from Neverovski\r\nwith the news that French troops were advancing by the south bank of\r\nthe Dnieper. Bagration had also, by some means, received intelligence,\r\nfor soon after came orders from him to halt. In the night, Raievski\r\nreceived a fresh order to return to support Neverovski. At daybreak on\r\nthe 15th the 7th Corps re-entered Smolensk.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 14th the Grand Army began to advance from\r\nRasasna. Murat led the way with Nansouty’s, Montbrun’s and Grouchy’s\r\ncorps and the light cavalry of the 1st and 3rd Corps; and behind him\r\ncame Ney’s three infantry divisions. In rear of Ney came Davout’s\r\ncorps, and then the Guard. Eugène was crossing at Rasasna; the 8th\r\nCorps was marching from Orsha on Davout’s right, and the 5th farther\r\nout, covered towards the south by Latour-Maubourg. Between two and\r\nthree in the afternoon the advance-guard reached Krasnoï, occupied by\r\nNeverovski’s division.\r\n\r\nVarious French writers have expressed astonishment at this small force\r\nhaving been left exposed, and apparently by accident on the south side\r\nof the Dnieper. All this is, of course, little better than nonsense,\r\nor, at best, adulation of Napoleon’s genius, which was so great that it\r\nrobbed his opponents of common sense! The sending of the 27th Division\r\nalong the left bank of the river was a perfectly rational measure of\r\nprecaution. It was in observation, and not intended to abide the attack\r\nof a greatly superior force, though it was quite capable of dealing\r\nwith a division or flying detachment. By whichever bank the Russian\r\nleaders chose to operate they could not leave the other unobserved,\r\nespecially since the French held the crossings at Orsha and elsewhere.\r\nThe mistake--presumably Bagration’s--appears to have been in not\r\nstationing the infantry closer to Smolensk and sending only the cavalry\r\nto observe the Orsha road.\r\n\r\nKrasnoï is a small town about 30 miles from Smolensk. Neverovski’s\r\ncavalry outposts were about Liady, a few miles west. They were driven\r\nout by Grouchy’s corps, which formed Murat’s left wing; and Neverovski\r\nlearned that overwhelming forces were marching upon him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nJOACHIM MURAT, KING OF NAPLES\r\n\r\nCommander of the French Cavalry\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by Gérard at Versailles]\r\n\r\nHe at once made his dispositions for retreat. A little east of Krasnoï\r\nthe Lossmina river flows to the Dnieper through a gully over which the\r\nhigh-road passed by the usual wooden bridge. Neverovski ordered the\r\n50th Chasseurs with 2 guns to march with all speed to Korythnia,\r\nnearly half-way to Smolensk, to form a sustaining force in case of a\r\ngrave defeat, and began to withdraw. When Murat and Ney arrived they\r\nfound him with 9 battalions, his cavalry and 8 guns, behind the ravine,\r\nwith 1 battalion and 2 guns in Krasnoï.\r\n\r\nThe general order of the French advance is a little uncertain, but\r\nGrouchy, with Chastel’s light horse and De la Houssaye’s dragoons,\r\nappears to have been on the left, the light cavalry of the 1st and\r\n3rd Corps with the 24th Léger, personally led by Ney, in the centre;\r\nMontbrun’s two Cuirassier divisions on the right, with Nansouty in\r\nsupport. The 24th Léger attacked and carried Krasnoï about 3 p.m.,\r\ncapturing the two guns and driving the remains of the garrison over\r\nthe ravine. The 9th Polish Cavalry followed them over the bridge, but,\r\nthrowing themselves rashly upon the supporting infantry, were repulsed.\r\nThe Kharkov dragoons pursued, but declined to charge in face of the\r\nmasses behind, and Neverovski, seeing the French numbers, sent his\r\ncavalry off to the rear, and began to withdraw, with his ten battalions\r\nranged in two dense columns.\r\n\r\nThe hostile horsemen were now crowding over the Lossmina ravine. Murat,\r\nhaving got some squadrons together, flung himself at the Russian\r\nrear-guard, threw it into disorder and captured five or six guns more.\r\nNeverovski rallied the broken troops, and then, apparently doubting the\r\nsteadiness of his young recruits, supported now by the fire of only two\r\nguns, united his force into a single great square. As the battalions\r\nwere formed, in Continental fashion, six deep, and as the number of men\r\nwas about 5000, each face was probably 130 yards long.\r\n\r\nAs the French and allied cavalry crossed the ravine each regiment\r\nhurried up to the front and singly and apparently haphazard charged\r\nthe retiring square. To all appearance Murat exercised no general\r\ncontrol, but acted like a mere regimental commander, riding furiously\r\nabout, leading isolated charges which were futile against steady\r\ninfantry. The artillery was mostly blocked at the Lossmina, and only\r\nthree Württemberg guns succeeded in coming into action; while Ney’s\r\ninfantry, which might have held the Russians until the guns could do\r\ntheir work, could not force its way up through the impeding hosts of\r\ncavalry. The country was much broken and cut up by small hollows and\r\ngullies; while the road was generally bordered by trees. Over this\r\ncountry, eastward of Krasnoï, on the way to Korythnia, was moving the\r\nhost of French, Polish and German horsemen, while in its midst the\r\ngreat square of the 27th Division lumbered solemnly along, with the\r\nattacks of the cavalry breaking upon it like waves upon a rock, firing\r\nand stabbing doggedly at everything that troubled it, and making its\r\nway steadily to Korythnia in spite of what its assailants could do. The\r\nfiring of the Russian recruits appears to have often been wild, but\r\ntheir steadiness was exemplary. Even when the three Württemberg guns at\r\nlast worked their way up and opened fire there was no shattering them.\r\nA Württemberg regiment did succeed, at one moment, in breaking into\r\nthe square, but was forced out again, and the 27th Division steadied\r\nits ranks and went on its dogged way. The charges grew more and more\r\nineffective owing to the fatigue of men and horses; and about 8 p.m.\r\nNeverovski arrived in safety at Korythnia. There he rallied his cavalry\r\nand rear-guard, and next day retreated on Smolensk. He had lost about\r\n1500 men in all, of whom half were prisoners, with 8 guns. The French\r\nlosses do not appear to have exceeded 800.\r\n\r\nThe action was extremely creditable to the young Russian troops, though\r\nit is only fair to say that they owed much to Murat’s mismanagement.\r\nNey, in the midst of the action, went to the King and endeavoured to\r\ninduce him to allow the infantry to pass to the front, but without\r\navail. He was furious, and wrote a memorandum to Napoleon begging him\r\nto have a regular advance-guard of infantry. Cavalry, as he pointed\r\nout, were powerless to prevent the retreat of infantry.\r\n\r\nRaievski reached Smolensk at dawn on the 15th. In the town was\r\nGeneral Bennigsen, who was accompanying the army apparently in the\r\nhope of succeeding to the chief command. To him the anxious commander\r\nof the 7th Corps went for advice, but Bennigsen was not the man to\r\nassist juniors in difficulties, much less to allow himself to become\r\nassociated with what might be a great disaster. He put Raievski off\r\nwith a few meaningless words, merely counselling him to save his\r\nartillery. Raievski, as he says, felt that when the fate of Russia hung\r\nin the balance it was no time to think of a few guns. He took up a\r\nposition about 2 miles in advance of the town, and awaited Neverovski,\r\nwho arrived at 2 p.m. From him Raievski learned that probably the whole\r\nFrench army was advancing upon Smolensk, and hurried off a despatch\r\nto Barclay. At 5 p.m. he heard artillery fire at his outposts, and,\r\nhurrying to the front, saw the masses of Murat’s cavalry coming up from\r\nKorythnia.\r\n\r\nRaievski did not falter. As he saw it his duty was plain. He and his\r\nmen must die, if necessary, in defence of the city, for if it fell\r\nNapoleon could take Barclay and Bagration in rear, cutting their\r\nline of communication with Moscow and the south. He was supported by\r\nPaskievich, to whom, according to his biographer, the main credit of\r\nthe resolution was due. This assertion may be taken for what it is\r\nworth, though there is no reason to doubt that Paskievich cordially\r\nsupported his chief’s resolution.\r\n\r\nSmolensk, in 1812, lay chiefly upon the southern bank of the river. It\r\nhad formerly been a great frontier fortress, but since the advent of\r\nartillery its importance had dwindled, owing to the fact that it was\r\nmore or less commanded by low heights. Its nucleus consisted of the\r\nancient fortified city, whose massive brick walls formed an irregular\r\npentagon of nearly four miles in circumference. These walls were\r\ngenerally about 30 feet high and from 15 to 20 in thickness. At the\r\ntop were galleries open to the sky, too narrow to admit of guns being\r\nplaced in position. At intervals were 32 towers, in which staircases\r\ngave access to the walls. It was only on the platforms of these towers\r\nthat artillery could be placed, and they were in general less solidly\r\nconstructed than the walls. Inside the walls were backed by ancient\r\nearthen ramparts. At the south-west angle was a small regular fort\r\nof earth, in so neglected a condition that its ramparts could easily\r\nbe scaled by infantry. This so-called “Royal Citadel,” dating from\r\nthe days of the Polish occupation, constituted in reality perhaps the\r\nweakest point in the line of defence. Close to the southern or Malakova\r\nGate a breach, made during the siege by Sigismund III of Poland in\r\n1611, was covered by an earthen redan. The walls were encircled by a\r\nditch and covered way, also in a neglected condition. Along the east\r\nside a considerable gully gave further protection, and at the west side\r\nwas another but shallower depression. All round the city were extensive\r\nsuburbs, mostly consisting of wooden buildings. Among them were many\r\ndismantled earthworks. These suburbs extended almost up to the walls\r\nof the inner city, and, since they afforded cover to assailants, the\r\ndefenders were practically forced to take up position either in or in\r\nadvance of them. They were generally called after the town the road to\r\nwhich passed through them.\r\n\r\nOn the south side four chief roads ran into Smolensk, that from Warsaw\r\nentering the city from the south-west by Krasnoï. The road from Mohilev\r\nby Mstislavl led nearly directly southward; that to Roslavl and Orel\r\nbranched off from it near the Malakova Gate; the Ielnia-Kaluga road led\r\nsouth-eastward for some distance, finally turning eastward.\r\n\r\nFrom the north gate, over a long wooden bridge, led three roads, that\r\nto Vitebsk on the left, that to Velizh and St. Petersburg in the\r\nmiddle, and that to Moscow on the right. The latter ran for some 5\r\nmiles along the bank of the Dnieper, and then crossed the chord of a\r\ngreat bend of the river to Solovievo, about 27 miles east of Smolensk,\r\nwhere it passed again to the south side. A cross-road passed by the\r\nvillage of Gorbunovo in a shallow curve to the high-road at Lubino, 14\r\nmiles distant. From the south side of Smolensk another track crossed\r\nthe Dnieper by a ford at Prudichevo, about 6 miles out, and also joined\r\nthe high-road about 2 miles west of Lubino. These tracks must be noted,\r\nsince a few days later they became of immense importance.\r\n\r\nRaievski had with him only 8 regiments and 6 batteries of his own\r\ncorps, and Neverovski’s weakened force. According to himself his\r\nstrength (probably infantry and artillery only) was scarcely 13,000\r\nmen. He had 72 guns. Realising that his duty was to contest the\r\ncity inch by inch, he ranged his force in advance of the suburbs.\r\nPaskievich’s division occupied the Krasnoï suburb and the ditch before\r\nthe citadel, with the Vilna Regiment from the 27th Division and a\r\nmakeshift battalion of convalescents stationed in reserve behind\r\nthe wall. Kolubakin’s division defended the Mstislavl suburb, and\r\nStavidzki’s brigade of the 27th that of Roslavl. These 23 battalions\r\ncould only guard about half of the south front of the suburbs. Four\r\nmore were in reserve in the town, and only two could be spared to\r\nwatch the line of nearly 2 miles from the Roslavl suburb to the river.\r\nTo make the best possible show Raievski stationed his cavalry there.\r\nEighteen guns were placed on the Royal Citadel; the rest along the\r\nearth ramparts behind the walls. Thus placed, the Russians awaited\r\nattack. Raievski says that though he had had little rest the night\r\nbefore he could not sleep.\r\n\r\nIn the night the Lancers of Lithuania and the New Russian Dragoons\r\nreached Smolensk, thus giving Raievski 12 more squadrons, with which he\r\nstrengthened his screen on the left.\r\n\r\nBy 10 p.m. on the 15th the bulk of Murat’s cavalry was about 3 miles\r\nfrom Smolensk, with its outposts in touch with Raievski. Ney’s corps\r\nwas immediately behind. Davout had reached Korythnia. The Guard was in\r\nrear of Davout; the head of the 4th Corps at Liadi. The 8th Corps had\r\nlost its way, but the 5th was nearly in line with Davout, and could\r\ncome up in the afternoon. Without reckoning Eugène and the Guard,\r\n120,000 men could be in front of Smolensk before evening.\r\n\r\nWhat, meanwhile, were Barclay and Bagration doing? Barclay was still\r\nanxious about an attack from the direction of Poriechie and sent\r\npressing orders to his cavalry commanders to endeavour to clear up\r\nthe situation. He doubted whether the advance on Smolensk was being\r\nmade by more than a part of the French army. Bagration was directed\r\nto cross the Dnieper at Katan, and join Raievski and Neverovski in\r\ndefending the Smolensk road. Dokhturov’s corps would take his place at\r\nNadva. Bagration moved to Katan and threw a bridge, but he soon became\r\naware that to cross would simply mean his annihilation. He sent word\r\nto Barclay that an army which he estimated at 115,000 men, without\r\nEugène and the Guard, was marching on Smolensk, and that he himself\r\nmust now go thither by the right bank. The reports of Bagration and\r\nRaievski removed Barclay’s doubts, and he issued orders for all his\r\ncorps to march upon Smolensk next day. To Raievski Bagration sent a\r\ncharacteristic message:\r\n\r\n “Dear Friend,\r\n\r\n “I shall not march to rejoin you--I shall run. I only wish I had\r\n wings. Courage! God will help you!”\r\n\r\nAt midnight on the 15th-16th Napoleon wrote to Eugène saying that\r\nSmolensk was evacuated. A little later Ney was ordered to occupy\r\nit. It does not appear that the Emperor had any definite information\r\nupon which to base his over-confident opinion. He seems indeed to have\r\nbeen impressed by Bagration’s bridge-building at Katan, which had been\r\nobserved on the 15th by a reconnaissance from head-quarters. A flank\r\nattack upon his army as it lay stretched along the Rasasna-Smolensk\r\nroad might have serious consequences. He consequently halted the whole\r\nof the 1st Corps about Korythnia, except Gudin’s division, which\r\ncontinued its advance on Smolensk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF SMOLENSK\r\n\r\nAugust 17 1812]\r\n\r\nVery early on the 16th the French and Russian outposts before Smolensk\r\nwere bickering with each other. Between 8 and 9 a.m. the bulk of Ney’s\r\nand Murat’s force reached the front. The King and the Marshal brought\r\nsome batteries into action against Raievski’s artillery, and Ney\r\ndeployed his corps opposite the Krasnoï suburb and the Royal Citadel,\r\nLedru’s division on the right, Scheler’s Württembergers on the left\r\nrear, Razout in reserve. Murat’s divisions extended to the right. The\r\nadvance posts were skirmishing hotly, and on both sides a number of\r\nguns were engaged, but, to the astonishment of Raievski, no attack\r\nwas made. He spoke afterwards of his success having been due to the\r\nfeeble measures of the French. Ney and Murat were, of course, awaiting\r\norders. Ney also had less than 19,000 infantry, scarcely enough to\r\nattempt to carry the city by main force, especially since he did not\r\nknow Raievski’s strength. Napoleon was keeping the bulk of his army\r\nready to face towards Katan and endeavouring to clear up the situation\r\nby reconnaissances. Towards noon he heard that the bridge had been\r\nremoved, and started for Smolensk. He arrived about 1 p.m. and, going\r\nat once to the front, closely reconnoitred the Russian position.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps in consequence of inferences made from what he had\r\nseen, that Napoleon directed Murat and Ney to press their advance. The\r\nindications as to time are very vague, but in all probability nothing\r\nlike an attack was made until the afternoon. Apparently about 1.30\r\np.m. the Russian cavalry were forced to retire under the walls of the\r\ntown, and the Württembergers began to press home the attack on the\r\nKrasnoï suburb. Raievski’s line was so thin that an advance in force\r\nat any point would shatter it. In strengthening the defence in the\r\nKrasnoï suburb troops had to be moved in that direction. All along the\r\nopposing fronts extended a line of fire, and, though the attack was\r\nnowhere being energetically pressed, the Russian troops were almost all\r\nengaged. There remained in reserve only the two regiments in the town,\r\nwhen Raievski was informed that the French had penetrated his skeleton\r\nleft and were approaching the bridge. He rushed off to repel them with\r\nhis feeble reserve, and at this moment a battalion of the French 46th,\r\nseeing the Royal Citadel almost denuded of defenders, dashed forward,\r\neasily mounted the crumbling earth rampart, and penetrated into the\r\ninterior. The garrison, however, resisted desperately. Raievski,\r\nfinding the report of the advance upon the bridge baseless, hurried\r\nback to the threatened point, supports were brought up, and the gallant\r\nassailants thrown back over the rampart just as a second battalion\r\nwas mounting to their assistance, carrying it away in their retreat.\r\nAs they went to the rear they were heavily fired upon, and suffered\r\ngreat loss. Elsewhere the only successes gained had been the driving\r\nin of stubbornly resisting outposts, and the French opportunity was\r\nfleeting. At 3.20 p.m. General Sokolnicki, a Polish officer attached\r\nto the General Staff, reported Russian troops on the road to Rudnia.\r\nGudin’s division did not reach the front until 4 p.m., Poniatowski\r\nnot until 5 p.m., and time was needed for the men to rest and to take\r\nup position. The critical period for the Russians was, in fact, over.\r\nFiring continued until dusk, but no attempt was made to press home an\r\nattack. The Russian main army was pouring down towards the city, and\r\nany success could hardly be more than a temporary one. Raievski’s fine\r\nresolution had robbed Napoleon of his chance; and it is no discredit\r\nto him that his own immediate peril had been less great than he had\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nBagration, despite his encouraging words, was not able to arrive to\r\nRaievski’s assistance until the evening, and as the distance from Katan\r\nto Smolensk is not more than 17 miles, it must be supposed that he felt\r\nhimself obliged to halt in order to become satisfied that Napoleon’s\r\nreconnaissances did not prelude a serious attack. He himself hastened\r\non to Smolensk, and having ascertained that Raievski was not as yet\r\npressed and also, apparently, that no attack was intended at Katan,\r\nhurried back to the latter place and directed Borozdin on Smolensk. The\r\nSecond Cuirassier Division had already been sent on. Raievski, feeling\r\nthat cavalry was useless in the town, kept them on the north side of\r\nthe Dnieper.[1]\r\n\r\nBarclay, having convinced himself of his error as to the direction of\r\nNapoleon’s attack, turned the heads of all his corps towards Smolensk,\r\nand the march was pressed with desperate energy. All through the\r\nhot summer’s day, over roads so bad as not to deserve the name, the\r\nRussian soldiers pressed forward. Tuchkov I with the 3rd and 4th Corps\r\nand Uvarov’s cavalry came from Kasplia by the Poriechie road; the\r\nGrand Duke Constantine, with the 2nd and 3rd, and Korf’s and Pahlen’s\r\ncavalry, from Volokovaia by Prikaz Vidra; Dokhturov from Nadva by the\r\nRudnia road; while Borozdin and Vassilchikov marched along the bank\r\nof the Dnieper. Tuchkov’s and Dokhturov’s troops had to march over 24\r\nmiles in a direct line without allowing for sinuosities in the roads\r\nand additions occasioned by moving into position, Constantine’s over\r\n22. Nevertheless, by five in the afternoon the whole army was within\r\neasy reach of the threatened town, and an hour later Borozdin’s leading\r\nbrigade reached the bridge to the support of Raievski.\r\n\r\nSmolensk being saved, the problem before the Russian generals was\r\nwhat next to do. Barclay anticipated that, having failed to capture\r\nSmolensk, Napoleon’s next move would be on Solovievo. Its seizure\r\nwould force the Russian armies either to reopen their chief line of\r\ncommunications at the sword’s point, with all the chances against\r\nthem, or to retreat northward. The abandonment of Smolensk would then\r\nbecome practically inevitable. It would, of course, have been perfectly\r\nfeasible to leave a garrison in the place which might have held out for\r\na week or two, but it may reasonably be asked what end could be gained\r\nby sacrificing it. At any rate, it was obvious that a possible French\r\nmove upon Solovievo must be guarded against, and it was arranged that\r\nthe Second Army should move eastward ready to anticipate the enemy at\r\nthe threatened point, while the First remained about Smolensk to defend\r\nthe line of the Dnieper.\r\n\r\nTo this end Dokhturov, with the 6th Corps, Konovnitzin’s division\r\nof the 3rd and the Chasseurs of the Guard, was ordered to relieve\r\nRaievski, and about midnight his troops arrived to take up the\r\npositions in the suburbs vacated by those of the former. Raievski left\r\nthe 6th Chasseurs at the disposal of Dokhturov; and the Dragoons of\r\nSiberia, Irkutsk and Orenburg replaced the cavalry of the Second Army.\r\nPaskievich assisted Dokhturov’s divisional leaders in posting their\r\ntroops; while the 7th Corps and 27th Division crossed the Dnieper and\r\nrejoined the 8th Corps. Next day Bagration started eastward, leaving a\r\nrear-guard at Sheïn Ostrog, 3 miles east of Smolensk, to guard a ford\r\non the Dnieper.\r\n\r\nIn Smolensk Likhachev’s division held the Krasnoï suburb and the\r\nRoyal Citadel, and that of Kapsevich those of Mstislavl and Roslavl.\r\nKonovnitzin’s division was held in reserve. For the present the left\r\nwas only watched by the 6th Chasseurs and the cavalry. The Guard\r\nChasseurs were at the bridge. Dokhturov had at his disposal about 120\r\nguns, some of which were hoisted on to the platforms of the towers.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the First Army was stationed on the St. Petersburg road,\r\nabout a mile and a half from the city, on a low plateau overlooking\r\nit. The corps of Baggohufwudt and Ostermann-Tolstoï were in front\r\nline, the former on the right of the road, the latter on the left. On\r\nBaggohufwudt’s right were the 1st and 2nd Cavalry Corps, while behind\r\nhim stood Strogonov’s division of the 3rd Corps. The 3rd Cavalry Corps\r\n(less the regiments in Smolensk) was stationed to the left and in\r\nadvance of the 4th Corps. The general reserve was formed by the 5th\r\nCorps, stationed 1 verst in rear of Strogonov. Finally, Platov’s and\r\nKarpov’s Cossacks watched the course of the river as far as Katan.\r\n\r\nWhile Dokhturov’s troops were taking up their positions they came\r\ninto collision with the French outposts, which were driven back\r\nsome short distance, Likhachev and Kapsevich making a general move\r\nforward at daybreak on the 17th in order to clear their front.\r\nThis has been usually regarded as a general sortie on the part of\r\nDokhturov to regain the suburbs, but neither in the French documents\r\nnor in Raievski’s account is there any indication that they had been\r\nevacuated. Meanwhile, Davout’s corps and the bulk of the Guard had\r\narrived; and Napoleon had before Smolensk on the morning of the 17th\r\nthe 1st, 3rd and 5th Corps, the Guard, and Murat’s eight cavalry\r\ndivisions--in all over 120,000 men. Junot’s corps, owing to a series\r\nof mischances and misdirections, for which Napoleon blamed Junot, and\r\nthe latter his senior divisional commander Tharreau, was still in rear.\r\nLatour-Maubourg was observing the country some distance to the south,\r\nwhile the 4th Corps was extended from Korythnia back to Rasasna.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was still uneasy concerning the Russian troops at Katan, so\r\nmuch so that on the 17th, by his orders, Ney sent thither Mourier’s\r\ncavalry brigade, supported by 6 battalions of Würtembergers and 6 guns,\r\nto guard against a possible flank attack. The force had a sharp action\r\nwith the Cossacks and supporting infantry, which cost them 11 officers\r\nand probably 200 men killed and wounded.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning there was continual skirmishing in the suburbs, but\r\nit was not until past midday that Napoleon ordered the advance. His\r\nreasons for assaulting the city at all are obscure, but it is possible\r\nthat he expected to be able to carry the suburbs without excessive\r\ndifficulty, and that the old walls of the city would easily yield\r\nto a steady cannonade. He may have counted upon the disadvantage of\r\nDokhturov’s position on a down slope, and on the fact that he himself\r\ncould overlook both the city and the opposite bank of the river.\r\nBogdanovich says that he wished to cross the Dnieper and cut off\r\nBagration’s army, and only when no ford could be found did he make a\r\ndirect assault--but there is no trace of this in the French documents.\r\nDe Chambray thinks that Napoleon expected the Russians to deliver\r\nbattle before the city. But from his higher ground he could see every\r\nmovement of troops from Barclay’s position. He therefore had no grounds\r\nfor making such an assumption, and there is no reason for supposing\r\nthat he did so. It is, of course, possible that he hoped by developing\r\nan assault, to induce Barclay to support Dokhturov with the bulk of his\r\nforces and fight with his back to the river, but there appears to be\r\nno evidence in favour of the supposition.\r\n\r\nAt about 12.30 the French advanced to the attack. Ney moved against\r\nthe Royal Citadel and the Krasnoï suburb, with Ledru’s division on the\r\nright, the remainder of the Württembergers on the left, and Razout\r\nin reserve. Davout assailed the Mstislavl suburb, Morand’s division\r\nin the centre, Friant’s on the right, and Gudin’s, accompanied by\r\nthe Marshal in person, on the left. Compans and Desaix were in\r\nreserve. Still farther to the right advanced Poniatowski’s corps, with\r\nZayonczek’s division marching on the left against the Malakova Gate,\r\nand Kniaziewicz’s on the right against the Nikolska suburb. The whole\r\neast front of the city was merely observed by Murat’s cavalry.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the attack was, up to a certain point, successful--as\r\nmight have been expected, when some 55,000 infantry were advancing\r\ndownhill against about 19,000, whose position among a straggling maze\r\nof timber buildings was swept by the fire of over 300 guns. Progress\r\nwas, however, very slow. Ledru and the Württembergers eventually\r\ncarried the riverine suburbs, but could get no farther; the Royal\r\nCitadel, now formidably armed and garrisoned, defied attack. Davout’s\r\nthree splendid divisions went forward with admirable determination,\r\ndrove Kapsevich’s troops into the suburbs, and gained ground steadily,\r\nthough at the price of very severe losses. On the right the Poles,\r\nafter fierce fighting, captured the suburbs opposite to them, but,\r\ncoming under the fire from the ramparts, were brought to a stand. The\r\nresult was that by five o’clock the French and Poles had carried all\r\nthe suburbs. Kapsevich’s division was being pressed back towards the\r\nwalls by Davout’s advance. Konovnitzin’s troops had all been used up in\r\nsupporting the fighting line.\r\n\r\nOn the French right the Russian dragoons were charged and driven back\r\ninto the city by the Polish cavalry. A battery of heavy artillery\r\nopened from the north bank of the Dnieper and checked the pursuers, but\r\nas it was isolated the Poles, with great gallantry, forded the river\r\nand rode forward to charge. They were attacked and repulsed by the\r\nescort of Barclay, who had just come thither to reconnoitre. A Lancer\r\nregiment was then detailed to escort the battery. Murat and Poniatowski\r\nnow established a mass of artillery on the bank which fired over the\r\ncity upon the permanent bridge and the temporary ones which had been\r\nthrown near it. Barclay thereupon placed several batteries in position\r\non the north bank opposite the French and Polish guns, and after a hot\r\ncannonade succeeded in silencing them or forcing them to withdraw. Sir\r\nRobert Wilson says that he chose the position for the Russian artillery.\r\n\r\nAs he saw himself driven from the suburbs Dokhturov sent to Barclay for\r\nreinforcements. The latter sent an encouraging message; and ordered\r\nforward the division of the young Prince Eugen of Württemberg, who had\r\nnever yet commanded in action, and was burning to distinguish himself.\r\nEugen reached the front at the most critical moment of the action.\r\nDokhturov’s reserves were all engaged; Ney was furiously assailing\r\nthe Royal Citadel; Davout and Poniatowski had driven Kapsevich and\r\nKonovnitzin upon and into the city, and were massing for an assault\r\non the Malakova Gate. Kapsevich’s division was broken and crowding\r\nback in complete disorder; Generals Skalon and Balla had fallen; and\r\nDokhturov, having no fresh troops to put in, was greatly depressed. The\r\nappearance of Eugen’s division relieved him. Pushnitzki’s brigade was\r\nsent off to the right to help Likhachev against Ney, Rossi’s to the\r\nleft to strengthen the defence against Poniatowski; and the Chasseur\r\nbrigade, led by Eugen himself, marched straight forward to the Malakova\r\nGate and, charging furiously out through the midst of the fugitives,\r\nreoccupied the covered way and checked the farther advance of Davout.\r\n\r\nThe driving of the Russians out of the suburbs marked the end of the\r\nFrench success. Rossi’s brigade reached the Royal Citadel just in time\r\nto help Likhachev to resist Ney’s final attack, which was repelled\r\nwith heavy loss, though Ledru and Scheler were now supported by the\r\n4th Regiment from Razout’s division. Dokhturov rallied Kapsevich’s\r\ndivision, and posted his force along the walls, Prince Eugen taking\r\ncommand on the left. The French halted within musket-shot, sheltering\r\nas best they could behind the houses and the old earthworks among them,\r\nbut losing heavily by the fire from the battlements, and especially\r\nfrom the light guns on the towers. It was clearly hopeless to attempt\r\nan assault until a breach had been effected, and Napoleon sent forward\r\n24 12-pounder guns of the Imperial Guard, which joined Davout’s\r\nreserve and opened a furious fire. The Russians retorted vigorously,\r\nand as the infantry attacks slackened, the battle became a tremendous\r\ncannonade. The Russian artillery strove its hardest to silence the\r\n12-pounder batteries, but in vain; they pounded steadily at the ancient\r\nwalls, the gunners encouraged by the example set by Davout and Comte\r\nSorbier, who personally directed their fire; but they could make little\r\nimpression. Accounts are conflicting as to the fate of the covered\r\nway, the Russians insisting that they occupied it; while the French\r\nequally declared that they carried it. Captain François of the 30e de\r\nLigne says that the enfilading fire of the French artillery finally\r\nobliged the Russians to abandon it; and that Davout’s sappers began to\r\nundermine the wall. Probably fortune varied at different points. It is\r\nonly certain that the French and Poles were definitely checked at the\r\nwall, and the battle died out when darkness came on.\r\n\r\nBy this time the city and suburbs were everywhere on fire. The French\r\nlater declared that the city had been deliberately destroyed; but\r\nthis is entirely improbable. Being very largely constructed of wood,\r\nit was certain to take fire, and both time and means were lacking to\r\nextinguish a conflagration which spread with the fall of every shell.\r\n\r\nThe losses on both sides had been heavy. The Russians had engaged\r\nonly 55 battalions, and Dokhturov’s entire force, including cavalry,\r\nCossacks and artillery, probably hardly exceeded 30,000 men. Barclay\r\nprobably understates his loss at 4000, but no Russian authority admits\r\nmore than 6000. Prince Eugen gives his own loss at 1300. Though his\r\ndivision came into action late it must be remembered that one brigade\r\nhad to execute a desperate sortie in the face of enormous odds and\r\na concentrated fire of cannon and musketry. Konovnitzin’s division\r\ncan hardly have suffered more; that of Likhachev and the detachments\r\non the left probably lost less in proportion. On the other hand,\r\nKapsevich’s troops must have lost heavily. Probably the Russian figure\r\nof 6000 casualties is near the mark. In other words, Dokhturov had lost\r\none-fifth of his effective strength. Raievski estimated his losses on\r\nthe 16th at about 1000, giving a Russian total for the two days of 7000.\r\n\r\nThe French losses were naturally much greater, since they had brought\r\nfar larger numbers into action, but were apparently not heavier in\r\nproportion. Davout gave the losses of the 1st Corps at from 5000 to\r\n6000 men. Gudin returned a loss in his single division of 294 killed\r\nand 1436 wounded, and his list was by no means complete. The 7th Léger,\r\nfor example, figures in it for 655 casualties, while, according to\r\nits Colonel, it had 707. Ney, according to Martinien’s lists, had 129\r\nofficers killed and wounded in his infantry and cavalry, and his total\r\nloss must have been in the neighbourhood of 3500. Poniatowski reported\r\na loss of 518 killed and 812 wounded; we must suppose that only the\r\nseriously hurt were registered. Reckoning the Polish losses at 2000,\r\nNey’s at 3500, Davout’s at 5500, and adding a possible 1000 for losses\r\namong the artillery, reserve cavalry and Guard, we have a total of\r\n12,000. Prisoners there were few on either side.\r\n\r\nAt 11 p.m. Barclay issued orders to evacuate Smolensk. He stated in\r\nhis memoir to the Tzar that he had only intended to hold it to give\r\nBagration time to get well forward on the Moscow road. This end was now\r\nattained, but the result of the order was what practically amounted to\r\nan open mutiny. A number of general officers, headed by the Grand Duke\r\nConstantine and by Bennigsen, who had no command and was not entitled\r\nto be present, went to Barclay’s quarters and furiously protested\r\nagainst the abandonment of the city. Sir Robert Wilson received urgent\r\nletters from many generals on the same subject. Bagration, though\r\nhe was not personally concerned in the mutinous demonstration, was\r\nbitterly indignant at Barclay’s determination. He persisted that the\r\nFirst Army could easily hold its ground on the high ground behind\r\nSmolensk, while the Second Army could pass the Dnieper and attack\r\nNapoleon in flank. Barclay was of opinion that for the Second Army to\r\nadventure itself over the Dnieper would mean its destruction, and that,\r\nas regarded holding the line of the Dnieper, Napoleon had merely to\r\nextend his right to cut the Russian communications. Furthermore, he\r\npoints out bitterly, operations of this kind, to be successful, require\r\nharmony between commanders. Towards the mutinous deputation he acted\r\nwith firmness and dignity. He declined to withdraw his orders, and\r\nbade them leave his presence. Foiled in the attempt to bring pressure\r\nto bear upon him, the malcontents enlisted Wilson on their side, and\r\ninduced him, as a personal friend of Alexander, to carry a letter\r\nto St. Petersburg demanding a new general. They also entrusted him\r\nwith a declaration on their part that if orders came from the capital\r\nto suspend hostilities the army would regard them as not truly\r\nexpressive of the Tzar’s real determination, and would continue the\r\nstruggle. All this was not altogether discreditable to the hearts of\r\nthe generals, if it did no special honour to their heads. Wilson, who\r\nhad rather hastily concluded that Barclay was not a fit person for the\r\npost of commander-in-chief and was also, it is to be feared, unduly\r\ninfluenced by his personal feelings towards Bennigsen and Bagration,\r\naccepted the mission. The result of wasting time in this mutinous\r\ndelegation was that the retirement from Smolensk was not properly\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD FORTIFICATIONS OF SMOLENSK\r\n\r\nThe north-east front abutting on the river. The illustration gives a\r\ngood impression of the deeply-sunken course of a Russian river]\r\n\r\nDokhturov withdrew his four divisions from the city without great\r\ndifficulty, carrying off all his guns and all but the most severely\r\ninjured of his wounded, took up the temporary bridges, broke\r\nthe permanent structure, and was safe. But in the confusion at\r\nhead-quarters no measures had been taken for properly occupying the\r\n_tête du pont_ on the right bank. At 2 a.m. Ney ascertained that\r\nthe wall in his front was deserted and entered the city, while a\r\nlittle later Davout also marched in by the Malakova Gate. The bridge\r\nwas broken, but the river was only four feet deep, and at 9 a.m. a\r\ndetachment of 600 Württembergers and Portuguese dashed through it and\r\nsurprised the _tête du pont_. The Chasseurs holding it were driven out\r\npell-mell. Hügel’s Württemberg brigade at once followed; Ney brought up\r\nhis artillery to the river’s edge and the work was maintained. Barclay\r\ncould only mask it with his rear-guard, under Baron Korff, consisting\r\nof 7 regiments of Chasseurs and 3 of Lancers and Hussars, which\r\noccupied the northern suburb. Davout promptly set to work to restore\r\nthe bridge.\r\n\r\nBarclay did not at once commence his retreat. For this Clausewitz\r\nblames him severely, but it must be remembered that on the 16th his\r\nwhole army had made a forced march, and that on the 17th part of it\r\nhad been heavily engaged. Then also he was probably still harassed and\r\ndistracted by the mutinous state of his subordinates. For the moment\r\nhis firmness appears to have crushed insubordination. The Grand Duke\r\nwas sent off to St. Petersburg under the pretext that his presence was\r\nneeded there. Otherwise Barclay’s delay was perhaps due to a desire\r\nto mislead Napoleon as to his line of retreat. In this he certainly\r\nsucceeded; but it was scarcely necessary to retain the whole of his\r\narmy in position; a well-handled rear-guard could have masked the\r\ndirection of the march.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 18th Napoleon was at the river-bank opposite Korff’s\r\nposition, but then he appears to have retired to rest, after sending a\r\nbrief letter to Maret at Vilna to announce the capture of Smolensk. He\r\ncertainly may have needed sleep, and it may also be imagined that the\r\nbulk of the army, which had fought all day and been astir all night,\r\nwas reposing. At any rate the day was one of inaction for both sides,\r\nexcept at the bridge, where desultory fighting went on until nightfall.\r\nNey slowly reinforced the _tête du pont_ by means of boats and rafts,\r\nbut the bridge could not be completed until Korff withdrew. It does not\r\nseem to have been ready until late at night. During the day Junot’s\r\ncorps and the head of the 4th reached Smolensk.\r\n\r\nThere is some reason to believe that on this day Bagration’s ugly\r\ntemper led him into the commission of what was practically an act of\r\ntreason. He took off his entire army to Solovievo, leaving only four\r\nregiments of Cossacks at the important road junction at Lubino. As the\r\nhigh-road by the river was commanded by French artillery on the south\r\nbank, Barclay would be forced to use for his retreat the cross-road\r\nby Gorbunovo, which reached the highway at Lubino, and certainly a\r\nhandful of light horsemen was a most inadequate guard for this vital\r\nlast point. Barclay says that he only learnt at the last moment that it\r\nwas practically uncovered. Bagration’s retreat was natural, now that\r\nSmolensk was abandoned, but in leaving no infantry at Lubino, and not\r\napparently informing his colleague, he committed, to say the least of\r\nit, a very dubious action. Otherwise the incident throws light on the\r\nbad staff-work of the Russians, and one may fairly ask why Yermólov and\r\nSt. Priest were not in close and frequent communication with each other.\r\n\r\nBetween 7 and 8 p.m. Dokhturov, with the 5th and 6th Corps, and Korff’s\r\nand Pahlen’s cavalry (less detachments to rear-guard), was ordered to\r\nmarch by cross-roads to Solovievo. An hour or so later the 2nd, 3rd\r\nand 4th Corps, with Uvarov’s cavalry corps, started by the Gorbunovo\r\ntrack for Lubino. At this moment apparently, Barclay heard that there\r\nwere no troops at that vital point except Karpov’s Cossacks. He at once\r\ndirected Major-General Tuchkov III with the Yelisabetgrad Hussars,\r\nthe Revel Regiment, the 20th and 21st Chasseurs and a horse artillery\r\nbattery to hasten thither. At 2 a.m. Korff withdrew from before\r\nSmolensk.\r\n\r\nFrom the first everything went wrong. The retreating columns\r\nencountered all kinds of difficulties. The roads were, of course,\r\nunspeakable. Gullies were frequent, and often had to be bridged for\r\nthe artillery to pass, nothing having been done in advance by the\r\ninefficient staff. The darkness and the troubles incidental to filing\r\nsome 40,000 men along a single bad track caused endless delays. To\r\ncrown all, the column missed its way and wandered into a side track,\r\nwith the result that at daybreak its rear was only 2 or 3 miles\r\nnorth-east of the St. Petersburg suburb! On the withdrawal of Korff,\r\nDavout had completed his bridge-restoring, and at 4 a.m. Ney’s main\r\nbody began to pass.\r\n\r\nBarclay, whose great military virtue was perfect self-possession in the\r\nface of danger, ordered Prince Eugen, with as much of his division as\r\nremained with him, to take up a position at the hamlet of Gedeonovo,\r\nbidding him recollect that the fate of the army might depend upon his\r\nfirmness. Ney’s advance-guard was soon in contact with Eugen, who held\r\nhis ground obstinately, in order to give Korff time to file past.\r\nAfter a good deal of fighting Eugen was forced back, but by that time\r\nKorff had got his 14 battalions on to the Gorbunovo-Lubino track. Eugen\r\nthen fell back to another position towards Gorbunovo, and Ney was\r\npreparing to follow, when orders arrived directing him to incline to\r\nhis right to the Moscow road. This appears to have been about 11 a.m.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 19th Napoleon sent Eblé to Prudichevo to bridge the\r\nDnieper, and ordered Junot’s corps to cross the river there, a\r\nmovement which would bring him to Lubino. Grouchy was sent along the\r\nSt. Petersburg road, Montbrun along that to Moscow, while Bruyère’s\r\ndivision of Nansouty’s corps was ordered to support Ney. Evidently\r\nNapoleon had no certainty as to the precise direction of Barclay’s\r\nretreat, and so far the Russian general’s delay on the 18th had\r\njustified itself. About 11 a.m. Davout’s corps began to cross the\r\nbridge. The Guard, now rejoined by Claparède, was in Smolensk.\r\nEugène and Poniatowski were in the ruins of the suburbs. The Emperor\r\napparently spent the morning in his cabinet, but in the afternoon\r\nmounted and proceeded to the high ground east of the city, opposite\r\nSheïn Ostrog.\r\n\r\nGeneral Tuchkov III in his march had to contend with the same\r\ndifficulties and obstacles which impeded the main column, so that he\r\ndid not reach the Moscow road, some 4 miles west of Lubino, until\r\n8 a.m. Toll accompanied him, and they went forward to confer with\r\nKarpov. It soon became evident that a force of cavalry, presumably\r\nthe advance-guard of Napoleon’s main body, was moving eastward from\r\nSmolensk, and also that a strong column was passing the Dnieper at\r\nPrudichevo. Tuchkov pushed Karpov out to observe Junot, and with his\r\nown column took up a position across the road, where it passed over a\r\nlow swell, with his flanks covered by some small woods and his twelve\r\nguns on the crest of the rise, and awaited events.\r\n\r\nSoon after 10 o’clock skirmishing began on the high-road, probably\r\nwith the advanced guard of Bruyère’s division, supported perhaps by\r\nsome battalions of light infantry; but it cannot have been until about\r\n1 p.m. that the head of Ney’s main column appeared, and the battle\r\nof Lubino definitely began.[2] By this time the 3rd Corps, which was\r\nat the head of Barclay’s column, had reached Lubino. As it tramped\r\nthrough, Tuchkov I detached Tornov’s brigade of Grenadiers to support\r\nhis brother.\r\n\r\nAt 1 p.m. the head of Ney’s infantry column began to attack. The\r\nRussians offered a steady resistance, and it was not until three that,\r\nseeing the heavy masses coming into line, and knowing that Junot was\r\nthreatening his left, Tuchkov decided to withdraw behind the Stragan\r\nrivulet, some 2 miles to his rear, and about the same distance from\r\nLubino. Ney inferred from the obstinate resistance that Tuchkov covered\r\nsome important movement, and asked Napoleon for support. It was\r\nprobably while he was awaiting a reply that Tuchkov drew off, covered\r\nby his cavalry, towards Lubino. Napoleon ordered Gudin’s division to\r\nreinforce Ney, sent Morand’s towards the left with a view to a turning\r\nmovement, but gave Junot no directions; clearly he had no conception of\r\nthe real importance of the action.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Russians had safely retired behind the Stragan, where\r\nthey were joined by Barclay, bringing with him 8 heavy guns, 7\r\nbattalions, and a mass of cavalry. The 3rd and 4th Corps had now\r\nreached Lubino, but Baggohufwudt and Korff were far to the rear, and\r\nthe cross-road was packed with baggage and hundreds of guns, which\r\nwould be the prey of the French could they break through. But Barclay\r\non the field, calm, brave and resourceful, was a very different\r\nman from the anxious and harassed Barclay of the cabinet. Without\r\nhesitation he ranged his scanty force in order of battle, and ordered\r\nYermólov to bring up the 3rd and 4th Corps with all speed.\r\n\r\nThe high-road, after crossing the Stragan, passed over the southern\r\nend of a low wooded plateau which extended northward for some 2 miles.\r\nSouth of the road a stretch of marsh, in most places passable owing to\r\nthe dry weather, extended to the Dnieper. Out of it arose several low\r\nswells of firm ground, studded with hamlets and patches of wood. One of\r\nthese lay near the road, and needed to be occupied.\r\n\r\nOn the northern plateau Barclay posted 5 infantry regiments, and to the\r\nsouth of the road 2 more, with 3 battalions in reserve. Twenty guns\r\nwere posted to sweep the road. On the swell in the marsh he stationed\r\n26 squadrons of Hussars under General Orlov-Denisov. Of infantry and\r\nguns there were no more available, and, to make a show of support\r\nfor Orlov-Denisov, Barclay ordered Uvarov’s cavalry to dismount, and\r\noccupy a village behind the marsh on his left. At 5 o’clock, just as\r\nthe action was renewed, Konovnitzin and, a little later, Choglokov\r\narrived, bringing with them 7 regiments of their divisions and a\r\nhorse-battery. Choglokov’s troops were ordered to support the cavalry,\r\nand Konovnitzin’s 4 regiments brought up to the centre.\r\n\r\nAt 5 p.m. Gudin’s division reached the front, and Ney at once sent it\r\nforward, Razout’s advancing level with it on the left. Some Württemberg\r\nartillery was carried forward with the advance to silence Barclay’s\r\nbattery. Ledru and Scheler remained in reserve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF LUBINO, AUGUST 19th, 1812\r\n\r\nFought to cover the passage of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Russian Army Corps\r\nfrom the north of Smolensk to the Moscow road at Lubino]\r\n\r\nComte Gudin, one of the finest officers in the French service,\r\nconducted the attack with splendid vigour. The 7th Léger, supported\r\nby 2 battalions of the 21st and 127th Regiments, crossed the Stragan,\r\nand, maddened by the fall of the General, who was struck down as he led\r\nthe charge, broke the Russian infantry to the south of the road and\r\ndrove them back, threatening to pierce Barclay’s thin defensive line.\r\nBarclay at once sent forward Konovnitzin’s division which, charging\r\nresolutely, checked the advance and enabled the broken troops to rally.\r\nGeneral Gérard, who succeeded to Gudin’s command, sent forward the 12th\r\nRegiment, and restored the battle on the right. Meanwhile, a fierce\r\nstruggle was raging north of the road where Razout was making desperate\r\nbut fruitless attempts to carry the plateau. Attack after attack was\r\nsteadily met and repulsed.\r\n\r\nBeyond Gudin’s right, Murat was coming up from Smolensk with Nansouty’s\r\nand Montbrun’s cavalry, but only his single light division (Bruyère)\r\ncould be of much service. Still farther to the right Junot was\r\nadvancing from Prudichevo, but showed great irresolution. He at first\r\ndeclined to move at all, and what actually took place is very obscure.\r\nHe seems, about five o’clock, to have reconnoitred the Russian left\r\nwith his cavalry brigade and two battalions of light infantry; and\r\nsome desultory fighting ensued. His cavalry do not appear to have\r\ngained any success, and a company of light infantry which established\r\nitself across the marsh was destroyed by the Russian Hussars. Then,\r\nwhen Choglokov’s infantry was seen coming into action, Junot formed\r\nhis corps in squares opposite the Russian left. At last General Ochs\r\nobtained permission to advance with 2 battalions of light infantry,\r\npresently supported by Junot with 4 companies of Voltigeurs. He was\r\nsuccessful in driving back the Russian outposts, and with this Junot’s\r\nattack came to an end. Murat had obliged Karpov’s Cossacks to retire\r\nbehind the main Russian line, and his light horsemen executed one or\r\ntwo more or less successful charges on Orlov-Denisov’s troopers, but\r\nwithout Junot’s co-operation he could do no more.\r\n\r\nAt 6 p.m. Tuchkov I had brought forward all his corps, and was himself\r\nat Lubino with his 3 rear-guard regiments, and 3 horse batteries\r\nwhich he had drawn out of the stream of retreating artillery. The\r\nposition was still critical. Baggohufwudt had not yet arrived. Korff\r\nwas still farther back; the trains were still pouring along the\r\nroad from Gedeonovo. But everyone on the Russian side was at last\r\nthoroughly awake to the emergency. Every attempt was made to hasten\r\nthe march; and the incompetent gilded youth of the General Staff, at\r\nwhom Eugen of Württemberg sneers bitterly, were doing useful work in\r\nsaving the trains and the precious artillery. At Lubino the bridge was\r\nutterly inadequate for the vast throng of vehicles. Prince Alexander\r\nof Württemberg suggested that another should be made. Löwenstern\r\ndismounted a squadron of Hussars and set them to tear down the houses,\r\nwhile Alexander and Baron Salza went with a company of pioneers to\r\nthe stream; and so, by desperate exertions, a bridge was constructed,\r\nto which a part of the mass was diverted. The tracks were all but\r\nimpassable in many places, and had to be corduroyed and made up with\r\nfascines and boughs before the trains could be got forward. The gunners\r\nand drivers, admirably directed and encouraged by Count Kutaïsov, made\r\nsuperhuman exertions to drag the artillery along, and, to their glory,\r\nnot a gun or caisson was abandoned.\r\n\r\nOn the Stragan the battle raged with unabated fury. Barclay de Tolly\r\nwas doing his uttermost, and though the line was often shaken it was\r\nalways reformed and steadied. Some of Ledru’s and Scheler’s troops\r\nendeavoured to get round the Russian right, but their attempts had\r\nno result; the Revel Regiment and the Bodyguard Grenadiers, fighting\r\ndoggedly with the bayonet, held them off; while Konovnitzin and Tuchkov\r\nIII still successfully defended the road. About seven Ney made a\r\ngeneral advance, calling up his reserves and sending forward every\r\navailable man. Gérard joined in on the right, throwing in his last\r\nthree battalions. The Russian position was critical, for Barclay had\r\nsent forward all his reserves; but at this moment Baggohufwudt’s corps\r\nat last made its appearance. Olsuviev’s division, which was marching\r\nat its head, was at once put in; and again the opposing forces closed\r\nin deadly strife. At first it seemed as if the French would carry all\r\nbefore them in their impetuous onslaught, and matters looked so dark\r\nthat Tuchkov III went himself to ask Barclay for aid--as did Windham in\r\n1855 in the Great Redan of Sevastopol. Barclay was furious. “Go back to\r\nyour post,” he stormed, “and get yourself killed! If you come back I’ll\r\nshoot you!”\r\n\r\nColonel Voïkov came up the road with his heavy battery just in time\r\nto check Gérard’s onslaught. Still the French held their own and,\r\nbelieving themselves victorious, were slowly gaining ground; when\r\nEugen’s division at length marched upon the field, and Tuchkov, burning\r\nto redeem himself, led on a counter-attack. He himself was wounded and\r\ntaken at the head of the Ekaterinoslav Regiment, but Eugen at once\r\nsupported, and after a bitter struggle, in which the bayonet was freely\r\nemployed, the French were finally repulsed. It was 9 o’clock when the\r\nroar of conflict died away in the darkness. Korff had reached the\r\nfield; the artillery and trains were on the way to Solovievo; and the\r\nRussians had gained a great strategic victory.\r\n\r\nMorand’s division had been unable to come into action, having been\r\nentangled in a piece of virgin forest, and was eventually recalled by\r\nNapoleon. It has been suggested that had he been allowed to continue\r\nhis advance it would have ensured the destruction of the Russian army.\r\nLacking definite information as to time and topography, it is difficult\r\nto express an opinion, but, judging from such descriptions as are\r\navailable, it seems very doubtful whether Morand could have debouched\r\nwith a force strong enough to be effective.\r\n\r\nBarclay, having attained the object for which he had stood to fight,\r\nhad no intention of waiting to be overwhelmed by Napoleon’s main army\r\nabout Smolensk. At 4 a.m. on the 20th his much-tried troops evacuated\r\nthe field, and marched 20 miles to Solovievo, where Dokhturov arrived\r\nthe same day. Bagration, having thrown three bridges over the Dnieper,\r\nwas already across. On the 21st the First Army followed, took up the\r\nbridges, and marched for Dorogobuzh.\r\n\r\nFrench writers for the most part consider Lubino, or Valutina-Gora as\r\nthey call it, a victory, but to regard it thus is merely to make a mock\r\nof the word. A battle is not necessarily fought for the possession\r\nof a few yards of ground. Barclay had fought at Lubino in order to\r\nsecure the safe passage of his right column into the Moscow road. This\r\nhad been successfully achieved, and very heavy loss inflicted on the\r\npursuers, who had failed to capture a single gun or any appreciable\r\namount of baggage. Napoleon regarded the battle as a mere advance-guard\r\nengagement. Had he realised its real importance he would not have\r\nfailed to send forward everything available. Barclay must have been\r\ndisastrously defeated, and probably driven northward with the remains\r\nof his army.\r\n\r\nThe French had on the field at Lubino about 50,000 men, of whom\r\nperhaps 37,000 were seriously engaged. The number of Russian troops\r\nsuccessively brought into action was probably about 30,000. The\r\nlosses were naturally heavy. Gérard alone reported 2297 killed and\r\nwounded, and Ney can hardly have lost less than 4000. Junot probably\r\noverestimated his losses at 700, but, including casualties among\r\nMurat’s cavalry, the French total must have been over 7000. The losses\r\nof the Russians were probably rather less, as they were standing on\r\nthe defensive, and for the most part succeeded in repelling attack,\r\nnevertheless, they were very heavy--probably in the neighbourhood of\r\n5000. Few prisoners were taken--not more than some hundreds on both\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to conclude this chapter without some remarks upon the\r\nstrategy which led up to the battles about Smolensk. It is tolerably\r\ncertain, judging from the evidence of documents, that Napoleon’s\r\nplan of marching upon Smolensk by the left bank of the Dnieper was a\r\npreconceived one. Considered by itself, there is little to say of the\r\nmanoeuvre. It was in no way hazardous, since the left flank of the\r\ncolumns moving from Vitebsk was covered by forests, and once across the\r\nDnieper the march was protected by the river against a Russian flank\r\nattack. Moreover, having two lines of supply, Napoleon risked nothing\r\nby moving his army across from one to the other.\r\n\r\nThe manoeuvre was certainly unexpected by the Russian leaders--except\r\nperhaps by Bagration--and it is clear that it was only the firmness of\r\nRaievski and the prompt return of the main army that saved Smolensk\r\nfrom falling into Napoleon’s hands.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when we turn from the manoeuvre to its purpose it seems\r\ndoubtful whether it was by any means the best under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s object was the bringing to bay of the Russian main army and\r\nthe crushing of it in a decisive battle. As the Russians had chosen\r\nto take the offensive, the opportunity was apparently in his hands.\r\nBarclay might march fast enough to force an engagement before Davout\r\ncould arrive from Orsha, but even so Napoleon could meet him with equal\r\nor superior numbers. If Barclay returned to the defensive, Napoleon’s\r\nbest manoeuvre was to advance to Poriechie, threatening the Russian\r\ncommunications with Moscow. To reopen them Barclay and Bagration must\r\neither give battle or retreat eastward in all haste, in which case\r\nSmolensk would fall of itself. The utmost that could be expected of the\r\nmarch south of the Dnieper was that the Russians might be forestalled\r\nat Smolensk.\r\n\r\nThe modern French opinion appears to be that this forestalling was\r\nthe essence of the plan, and that Napoleon, having occupied the city,\r\nintended to debouch from it and attack Barclay and Bagration in the\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nTo the writer it appears that all criticism must necessarily base\r\nitself upon the fact that Napoleon’s strategy was preconceived. Before\r\nhe knew anything of the Russian plans he had practically made up his\r\nmind to advance on Smolensk by the left bank of the Dnieper. The\r\noffensive movement of the Russians produced no change in his resolution.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that his determination was taken on grounds not\r\npurely military. He must by now have recognised that warfare in Russia\r\nwas subject to conditions which did not obtain in Germany or Austria.\r\nHis opponents were elusive; but there were certain places regarded by\r\nsoldiers and people as holy, which the popular voice would probably\r\nforce the generals to make a show of defending. He therefore resolved\r\nto threaten Smolensk directly, believing that thereby the Russian army\r\nwould be constrained to give battle.\r\n\r\nEven so it appears somewhat doubtful whether this end could not have\r\nbeen as well attained by manoeuvring on the right bank. The advance\r\nby the left appears to have assumed that Smolensk would be uncovered\r\nand undefended, and that the Russian field army would be too far away\r\nto return to its rescue. Napoleon, on this hypothesis, would have\r\nbeen able to occupy it and give battle to his outmanoeuvred opponents\r\nwith all the prestige of the capture of the sacred city behind his\r\nonset. As a fact Barclay had provided for speedy information by his\r\nflank-guard under Neverovski, and his resolution not to move far from\r\nSmolensk afforded the means of frustrating Napoleon’s strategy. That he\r\nonly arrived in the nick of time hardly affects the discussion, since\r\nhis obsession about an attack from the direction of Poriechie delayed\r\nhim for a day. On the other hand, Napoleon’s hesitation, owing to the\r\nappearance of Bagration’s army at Katan, also caused him to lose a\r\nday, during which Barclay was able to arrive.\r\n\r\nAccording to Barclay’s memoir to the Tzar he had no intention of\r\nwasting his army in the defence of Smolensk, a place of no military\r\nvalue, and merely held it in order to allow Bagration time to occupy\r\nSolovievo. Bagration and the majority of the Russian generals appear\r\nto have expected that he would have made it the centre of the Russian\r\noperations. It is, of course, possible that Barclay, harassed and\r\nperplexed, did make some conditional promise as to defending Smolensk\r\nshould a favourable opportunity offer. General Okunev--who may perhaps\r\nvoice the views of Paskievich--apparently thinks that it could have\r\nbeen held. But it must be said that as the Russians’ line of retreat\r\nwas in extension of their left flank such a policy would have been\r\nhazardous at best. There seems every reason to believe that Barclay’s\r\nideas were sound; what he lacked was commanding strength of character\r\nto enforce them on his unruly officers.\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s assault upon Smolensk is very difficult to account for: and\r\nled to little but waste of human life.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This is my own explanation of what happened. Bagration\r\nsays that he reached Smolensk at 10 a.m.; but Raievski declares that\r\nthe leading brigade of the 8th Corps did not arrive until past 6 p.m.,\r\nand speaks of Bagration coming later. Either the march of the 8th\r\nCorps was much delayed, or it moved with amazing slowness under the\r\ncircumstances. Seeing what Bagration had written to Raievski, it is\r\ndifficult to suppose that he would not make all speed to his rescue. It\r\nis only possible to reconcile the conflicting statements as to the hour\r\nof Bagration’s arrival at Smolensk by such an assumption as is made in\r\nthe text. For the rest it must be admitted that Bagration’s despatches\r\nare often unreliable, and he naturally endeavoured to present himself\r\nin the best light. When there is a conflict of testimony between him\r\nand Raievski, I prefer to believe the latter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Only thus is it possible to reconcile the statements of\r\nthe Russian historians that the action began at 10 a.m. with that of\r\nEugen of Württemberg, that he did not withdraw from Gedeonovo until\r\nabout that hour. Ney seems to have followed him to his second defensive\r\nposition before he was recalled, which brings us to 11 a.m. at least;\r\nand then time must be allowed for the march of nearly 6 miles to\r\nTuchkov’s front.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE OPERATIONS IN VOLHYNIA AND ON THE DÜNA\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that when King Jerome resigned his command, the\r\n5th and 8th Corps went to reinforce Davout, Latour-Maubourg to\r\nobserve Bobruisk, while the 7th Corps returned to Slonim. Reynier\r\nwas instructed to take the place of Schwarzenberg in guarding the\r\nfrontier of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, while the latter marched on\r\nMinsk. Reynier himself was convinced that his corps was far too weak\r\nfor the prescribed duty, while he had better information than his\r\nmaster of Tormazov’s real strength. Nevertheless he endeavoured to\r\ncarry out Napoleon’s orders. On the 19th he ordered Klengel’s infantry\r\nbrigade and a regiment of cavalry to take the place of an Austrian\r\ndetachment at Kobrin. On the same day Schwarzenberg informed Napoleon\r\nthat Tormazov had some 30,000 men at Lutsk. The Emperor, however, was\r\nsceptical. On the 22nd he ordered Reynier to enter Volhynia, saying\r\nthat Tormazov’s “army” was merely a collection of reserve battalions.\r\nOn the same day he told Davout that Tormazov had only 8000 men of 3rd\r\nbattalions. The movements which he had ordered continued, and by the\r\n24th the Austrians were about Slonim, on the way to Minsk, while the\r\n7th Corps, moving in the opposite direction, was approaching Kobrin,\r\nsome 30 miles east of Brest-Litovsk.\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s information was hopelessly inaccurate. So far he could\r\nnot be accountable for the unforeseen situation which was now to\r\ndisclose itself. But his refusal to believe Schwarzenberg and Reynier\r\nis distinctly blameworthy, and can only be attributed to the fatal\r\noptimism which had now become fixed in him.\r\n\r\nGeneral Tormazov, when hostilities broke out, commanded an army which\r\nwas neither concentrated nor complete in its organisation. Three\r\ninfantry divisions, a brigade of combined Grenadier companies, 3\r\nregiments of Hussars, and a cavalry corps 36 squadrons strong, were\r\nscattered over western Volhynia. General Sacken’s reserve troops--12\r\ndepleted battalions and 24 squadrons--were at Zaslavl and Staroï\r\nKonstantinov near the frontier of Podolia, and the irregulars were\r\nscattered along the Austrian and Polish borders. It was not until the\r\nmiddle of July that a respectable force was at last concentrated near\r\nLutsk.\r\n\r\nTormazov’s original task was the defence of Volhynia, but Napoleon\r\nshowed no intention of making any eccentric movements in that\r\ndirection. On hearing of Bagration’s retreat on Bobruisk, he thought\r\nthat he himself might be obliged to fall back towards Kiev, in order\r\nnot entirely to lose touch with the Second Army. By the middle of\r\nJuly, however, the situation became clearer. The allied troops were\r\npouring along the Warsaw-Smolensk road, and there were only few and\r\nsmall detachments guarding the Polish frontier. He therefore determined\r\nto invade the Grand Duchy of Warsaw by way of Lublin; and General\r\nLambert, his cavalry commander, had already crossed the Bug, when he\r\nwas recalled.\r\n\r\nOn July 17th instructions reached Tormazov from Alexander to advance\r\nnorthward against the flanks and rear of the forces that were opposed\r\nto Bagration. It is probable that this manoeuvre promised more\r\nimmediate results than the contemplated advance on Warsaw. At the same\r\ntime it is by no means certain that Tormazov was wrong in his original\r\ndecision. The capture of Warsaw would have been a terrific shock to\r\nNapoleon’s prestige. The Russians could not have held it long, but\r\nthey would have been able to destroy the depôts there collected, and\r\nmight have cut up Reynier’s corps had Napoleon, as was probable, urged\r\nit in overhasty pursuit of an enemy whose strength he underestimated.\r\nIn that case Napoleon would have been obliged to divert against him not\r\nmerely Schwarzenberg’s Austrians, but perhaps also the 8th Corps. In\r\nany case he would have been forced to employ some of his new formations\r\nin the rear to meet the irruption.\r\n\r\nThe plan now imposed upon Tormazov had the advantage that it must,\r\nin the nature of things, call back Schwarzenberg from his march to\r\nreinforce Davout. On the other hand, it involved passing the Pinsk\r\nMarshes, which would oppose a dangerous barrier to retreat in case of\r\na reverse; and the chances of crushing the 7th Corps were minimised,\r\nsince a few concentric marches would unite Reynier and Schwarzenberg.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sacken with his reserves had been left in eastern Volhynia;\r\nsome of his troops were detached to strengthen the force at Mozyr.\r\nOn July 22 Tormazov ordered Lambert to leave General Kruchov, with a\r\nbrigade of dragoons and 2 regiments of Cossacks, to observe the Polish\r\nfrontier, and with 4 battalions, 16 squadrons, 5 Cossack regiments and\r\n6 guns, to march by both banks of the Bug upon Brest-Litovsk. Four\r\nbattalions and 7 squadrons, under Major-General Melissino, were to make\r\na demonstration towards Pinsk, while the corps of Kamenski and Markov\r\nadvanced upon Brest-Litovsk and Kobrin. Tormazov’s strength, exclusive\r\nof Kruchov, was probably about 36,000 men, with 144 guns. He was\r\nconsequently nearly three times as strong as Reynier’s corps; but the\r\nlatter could be sustained within a few days by 30,000 Austrians.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th Reynier’s main body was about Bezdizh on the\r\nBrest-Litovsk-Pinsk high-road. Klengel’s brigade occupied Kobrin. Two\r\nsquadrons of cavalry were at Brest, and another detachment was on\r\nthe road to Pinsk. Reynier’s small corps was thus spread out over a\r\nline of 80 miles. Reynier appears to have realised his danger, and\r\nprovided against it to the best of his ability by keeping his main body\r\ntogether. He was perhaps to blame in detaching Klengel, but in justice\r\nit must be said that his duties were out of all proportion to his\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th Lambert expelled the Saxon cavalry from Brest-Litovsk.\r\nMelissino drove in the outposts on Reynier’s left, and occupied Pinsk,\r\nexpelling its Austrian garrison and capturing a gun. Reynier was thus\r\nalarmed on both flanks, and doubted in which direction to turn. Early\r\non the 27th Tormazov’s advanced guard, under Major-General Chaplitz,\r\napproached Kobrin from the south, while at the same time Lambert’s\r\ncavalry came up from the west. His infantry, who were fatigued by hard\r\nmarching, he had left in the rear.\r\n\r\nKlengel’s brigade consisted of only about 2600 men with 8 guns.\r\nObviously he could make no effective resistance to the Russian army;\r\nbut he considered himself bound by Reynier’s orders to defend Kobrin\r\nto the last extremity. Reynier’s comment was that, being the advanced\r\nguard of the corps, the brigade should have retired when it became\r\nobvious that it ran the risk of being surrounded. It appears to be a\r\nsomewhat uncertain point among military men as to how far detachment\r\ncommanders are justified in departing from the letter of their orders.\r\nOn the morning of the 27th Klengel’s line of retreat on Pruzhani was\r\ncertainly open. On the other hand, his corps commander would probably\r\ncome by the Pinsk road; and he appears to have made at least one\r\nattempt to break through in that direction, which gives some index to\r\nwhat was passing in his mind. By midday Lambert had cut the road to\r\nPruzhani, and the brigade was surrounded. The Saxons were driven by\r\noverwhelming numbers from their hasty entrenchments into the town, and\r\nafter a gallant resistance, and having expended all their ammunition,\r\nwere forced, about 2 p.m., to surrender. They had lost 76 killed and\r\n182 wounded, including 13 officers. Seventy-six officers and 2382 rank\r\nand file were captured, with 8 guns and 4 standards.[3] Reynier’s\r\nadvance-guard had only reached Horodetz, about 11 miles east of Kobrin,\r\nwhen it was met by fugitives who bore tidings of the disaster.\r\n\r\nTormazov, with diplomatic courtesy, complimented the Saxon officers on\r\ntheir really creditable defence, and returned them their swords. He\r\ncould not, however, push his advance. His commissariat was defective\r\nand supplies were running short. He had also his prisoners to dispose\r\nof. His infantry were fatigued with hard marching on execrable roads.\r\nHe therefore was obliged to halt for two days, which Reynier utilised\r\nto effect his retreat. He appealed for help to Schwarzenberg, who\r\ninformed Napoleon that Reynier was too weak to resist Tormazov, who\r\nwas estimated to be 40,000 strong, and that he must perforce turn\r\nback to his rescue from Nesvizh. On August 2nd he reached Polonka, 18\r\nmiles from Slonim, now occupied by Reynier. Tormazov, leaving Kobrin\r\non the 30th, occupied Pruzhani and Antopol and pushed out detachments;\r\nwhile Kruchov’s force crossed the Bug and made reconnaissances towards\r\nWarsaw. The Poles were panic-stricken; and Loison, the Governor of\r\nKönigsberg, thought it necessary to advance towards Bielostok with\r\nnearly the whole of his force--some 10,000 men. More than this Tormazov\r\ncould not do. He was still very short of supplies; every march in\r\nadvance took him farther from his base, and he had the Pinsk Marshes in\r\nhis rear.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, probably with some misgivings, informed Schwarzenberg on July\r\n31st that he was to support Reynier according to his information,\r\nwhich, as he was on the spot, must necessarily be better than that of\r\nthe Emperor. On August 2nd he placed the 7th Corps under his orders,\r\nand instructed him to march against Tormazov and drive him into\r\nVolhynia. The Government at Warsaw meanwhile was making desperate\r\nefforts to form a field force at Zamosc, under General Kosinski.\r\n\r\nOn August 3rd the Austrians and Saxons were in close communication,\r\nand on the 4th the united force began to advance. Tormazov’s advanced\r\nguards were attacked on August 8th and driven back, except at\r\nPruzhani, from which Lambert was only expelled on the 10th after a\r\nwell-contested rear-guard action. Tormazov, finding his outposts\r\neverywhere assailed by superior forces, ordered Markov and Kamenski to\r\nGorodeczna, about half-way from Pruzhani to Kobrin. Lambert and Markov\r\nunited there in the night of the 10th-11th, and next day Kamenski also\r\narrived. Melissino’s detachment and the other advanced guards, under\r\nGenerals Chaplitz and Prince Khovanski, could not rejoin under some\r\ndays. Tormazov therefore had only 24 battalions, 36 squadrons, and 3\r\nregiments of Cossacks, amounting with artillery to about 21,000 men. In\r\nartillery, however, he was strong, having 84 pieces, a large proportion\r\nof which were heavy.\r\n\r\nThe Russian position was a fairly strong one, if defended by adequate\r\nnumbers. The Pruzhani-Kobrin road passes over a low plateau, at the\r\nfoot of which flows a marshy stream. This plateau is some three miles\r\nlong and a little less in breadth. It extends roughly east and west,\r\nits eastern extremity being opposite Gorodeczna. West of it is a valley\r\nabout a mile in breadth, beyond which rises a second plateau, thickly\r\nwooded, through which another road leads from the village of Cherechev\r\nto join that to Kobrin some miles south-west of Gorodeczna. The eastern\r\nend of the plateau was also shut in by woods. Besides the causeway\r\nacross the marsh at Gorodeczna, there was a second at Poddubno about\r\nthree miles above, and a third a mile farther on at the Cherechev road.\r\nObviously all should have been guarded; but only that at Gorodeczna\r\nwas actually held. The reasons for this extraordinary oversight are\r\nnot clear. It is possible that Tormazov expected a turning movement on\r\nthe right rather than the left. It is also possible that he did not\r\nintend to fight a general action, but only a rear-guard engagement,\r\nin order to gain time for Chaplitz, Khovanski and Melissino to close\r\nup. Apparently also he considered that Schwarzenberg and Reynier\r\nwere following him in one column on the Kobrin road. In any case he\r\nmerely kept the bulk of his force opposite Gorodeczna. His opponents\r\nwere moving in two columns, the Austrians upon Gorodeczna, Reynier\r\nwith the Saxons on the right towards Poddubno. Schwarzenberg had made\r\nconsiderable detachments to guard his communications, but his entire\r\nforce can hardly have numbered less than 36,000 men, including 12,000\r\nSaxons, with 96 guns.\r\n\r\nReynier pointed out to Schwarzenberg that Tormazov’s negligence\r\nafforded opportunities for a flanking movement. Schwarzenberg assented\r\nand supported him with Siegenthal’s division, Hesse-Homburg’s brigade\r\nof Bianchi’s division, and a brigade of light cavalry, while with the\r\nrest of his forces he observed the main Russian force. Tormazov was\r\ndrawn up in three lines on the Kobrin road, facing Gorodeczna, Markov’s\r\n12 battalions in front line, Kamenski’s 12 (temporarily commanded by\r\nPrince Cherbatov, Kamenski being ill) a verst to the rear, Lambert with\r\nthe cavalry behind Cherbatov.\r\n\r\nIn the night of the 11th-12th a Saxon detachment seized the Poddubno\r\ndyke. Tormazov apparently heard of this about 9 a.m. on the 12th and\r\npromptly sent Cherbatov with 10 battalions, 2 dragoon regiments and 24\r\nguns to Poddubno. This appeared temporarily to secure the left, but\r\nabout noon Siegenthal arrived and threatened a direct attack, while\r\nReynier, who had moved the bulk of his corps along the Cherechev\r\nroad, debouched from the woods and menaced the Russian rear. Tormazov\r\nat first simply fronted Cherbatov to the left, leaving the guns and\r\na single infantry regiment at Poddubno, and covered the new front\r\nwith the fire of 24 more guns brought up from the reserve. It soon,\r\nhowever, became evident that the turning movement was being executed by\r\nconsiderable forces, and that Cherbatov could not withstand it unaided.\r\nTormazov thereupon called up Markov with 8 battalions to prolong\r\nCherbatov’s line, and Lambert with 4 battalions and 24 squadrons to\r\ncover the left flank. Lambert deployed across the Cherechev road,\r\nbarring it against the farther advance of General Zechmeister with his\r\nAustrian cavalry and Saxon infantry. Schwarzenberg on his side, instead\r\nof attacking the weak detachment now before him at Gorodeczna, sent\r\nanother infantry brigade and one of cavalry to the right, and himself\r\nproceeded thither.\r\n\r\nAt 3 a.m. Frimont’s Austrian cavalry and Trautenberg’s infantry at\r\nGorodeczna were demonstrating against weak detachments, while nearly\r\nthe whole Russian army had faced to the left and rear. Tormazov,\r\nconsidering that the extension of the hostile line afforded an\r\nopportunity for piercing it, developed a fierce attack by Cherbatov’s\r\ninfantry upon Sahr’s Saxon brigade, which was driven back, barely\r\nsaving its artillery from capture by the Russian dragoons. To\r\nextricate it General Bianchi led forward Lilienberg’s brigade, while\r\nSchwarzenberg, now at Poddubno, ordered Hesse-Homburg’s across the\r\nstream, and Siegenthal sent forward part of his division. By these\r\ncombined efforts the advance of the Russians was brought to a stand and\r\nfinally converted into a retreat. The brigades of Lilienberg and Sahr\r\nmoved forward together, Hesse-Homburg joining in on the left, Lecoq’s\r\nSaxon division prolonging the line to the right, while Zechmeister,\r\nreinforced by Froelich’s Austrian and Gablenz’s Saxon cavalry,\r\nrenewed his attacks on Lambert. The latter had hitherto held his own\r\nwith considerable success, but was now driven back and forced to seek\r\nshelter behind Markov’s line. Night ended the conflict, and under cover\r\nof darkness Tormazov rallied his detachments and retreated on Kobrin,\r\ncovered by a rear-guard, under Lambert. At Teveli, 7 miles from the\r\nbattle-field, Chaplitz rejoined and took over rear-guard duty from\r\nLambert.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF GORODECZNA\r\n\r\nFought between Napoleon’s detached right wing (Austrians and Saxons)\r\nunder Prince Schwarzenberg against the Russian Army of Volhynia]\r\n\r\nThe Russian loss appears to have been about 3000 men out of a total of\r\nabout 18,000 actively engaged: of these perhaps 500 were prisoners.\r\nThat of the allies was probably a little less. Schwarzenberg estimated\r\nthe loss of the Austrians at about 1300, of whom 865 were in Bianchi’s\r\ndivision. Reynier only admitted 931 casualties.\r\n\r\nTormazov did not stay his retreat at Kobrin, but continued on his way\r\nsouthward, intending to make for the Styr and stand on the defensive\r\nbehind it. His resolution was undoubtedly wise. With Chaplitz’s\r\nand Khovanski’s troops he had in hand 30,000 men, and might abide\r\nthe chances of another battle. But his force was too small to rout\r\nSchwarzenberg’s, and a heavy defeat might leave Admiral Chichagov, who\r\nwas at last on the way from Bukharest, too weak to face Napoleon’s\r\nright wing. On the other hand, by retreating on Lutsk he would lessen\r\nthe distance between himself and the Admiral, would be in closer\r\ncommunication with his base at Kiev and Sacken’s reserves, and his\r\nposition behind the marshy Styr might well induce the cautious Austrian\r\ngeneral and his half-hearted or openly disaffected lieutenants to call\r\na halt.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th there was some rear-guard fighting on the Kobrin road,\r\nbut it was not serious, and Tormazov continued his retreat to Kovel,\r\nwhich he reached on the 24th. There he apparently would have stood\r\nfirm, but Schwarzenberg threatening to turn his left he abandoned his\r\nposition and marched towards Lutsk, where he arrived on the 29th.\r\nSchwarzenberg’s pursuit was not very energetic, owing to scarcity of\r\nsupplies and the difficulty of the Pinsk fenlands.\r\n\r\nTormazov therefore found himself at the beginning of September in the\r\nsame position which he had occupied five weeks before. His strategy\r\nhad been far from faultless: in particular his detachments previous to\r\nthe battle of Gorodeczna seem to have been unnecessarily large. His\r\ntactics at Gorodeczna had been bad at the outset, however much his\r\nboldness and energy may have compensated for his earlier carelessness.\r\nStill, whatever his faults, he had inflicted a heavier loss than he\r\nhad sustained, and had drawn upon himself, away from the main theatre\r\nof war, the whole of the Austrian auxiliary army and the 7th Corps,\r\nas well as Kosinski’s Polish column from Zamosc. Moreover, Admiral\r\nChichagov’s advanced guard was only fourteen or fifteen marches away,\r\nand might be relied upon to join him by the middle of September.\r\n\r\nIt has already been seen that when Barclay evacuated Drissa he had left\r\nCount Wittgenstein to cover the road to St. Petersburg. Wittgenstein\r\nhad for his principal bases of operations the ancient towns of Pskov\r\nand Velikii Novgorod; his advanced depôt was Sebezh, some 60 miles\r\nfrom Polotsk, on the road to Pskov. In addition to his own 1st Corps\r\nhe was given the bulk of the depôt troops at Drissa and Dünaburg, and\r\nhis artillery was strengthened by a heavy battery. The 18 reserve\r\nbattalions hardly mustered 5700 bayonets, but the 15 depôt squadrons\r\ncould furnish 1900 sabres and lances, and included those of the\r\nImperial Guard, some of the finest in Europe. Wittgenstein’s fighting\r\nstrength, after the departure of Barclay, totalled some 29,000 men,\r\nof whom 4500 were cavalry and Cossacks, with 108 guns. Of this total\r\n10 reserve battalions and 4 squadrons, about 3700 strong, were at\r\nDünaburg; the rest were united under Wittgenstein’s immediate command.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Corps contained in its staff a considerable foreign element.\r\nWittgenstein, his chief-of-staff, Major-General D’Auvray, and the\r\nQuartermaster-General Diebich, were all Germans. Wittgenstein himself\r\nwas a man of no special talent, but active and energetic, and in the\r\nprime of life. D’Auvray was an older man, but possessed plenty of\r\nvigour, and was a good theoretical officer, though somewhat deficient\r\nin practical experience of warfare. Colonel Diebich, a Prussian,\r\nonly twenty-seven years of age, was probably the most intellectually\r\ndistinguished of the three. His enduring fame as “Zabalkanski”--the\r\nBalkan-Passer--dates from the year 1829, when he commanded in chief\r\nagainst the Turks. For the present all that need be observed is that\r\nthe command of the Russian army of the Düna was in vigorous hands.\r\nClausewitz notes that D’Auvray, especially, could “lay about him” at\r\nneed; and doubtless the process was often necessary in dealing with the\r\ngallant but amateurish and frequently indolent Russian officers.\r\n\r\nFrom Dünaburg to Riga, a distance of some 130 miles, there were\r\npractically no Russian troops. In the great Baltic port and its\r\nneighbourhood there were 30 depôt battalions, 8 squadrons, and some\r\nCossacks and field artillery, which, with garrison troops, totalled\r\nperhaps 14,000 men, sufficient to defend the fortifications and\r\noutlying places, but not to furnish any considerable detachment for the\r\nfield. Riga was furthermore defended by Russian and English gunboats\r\nand bomb-brigs; and naval assistance to almost any amount was available\r\nfrom the British Baltic fleet, should it be necessary. Riga was\r\npractically secure against any but a very large army. Its commander,\r\nLieutenant-General Essen I, was an officer of no great ability, and in\r\npoor health.\r\n\r\nThe Russian forces therefore available for the defence of Kurland and\r\nthe line of the Düna amounted in all to perhaps 43,000 men, but could\r\nbe reinforced to nearly double that number by militia and regulars, the\r\nlatter partly depôt troops, but chiefly belonging to Count Steingell’s\r\narmy of Finland, soon rendered disposable by the conclusion of peace\r\nwith Sweden.\r\n\r\nTowards Riga Napoleon had directed the so-called 10th Corps, under\r\nMarshal Macdonald. It had, in fact, as Macdonald complained, no proper\r\ncorps organisation or administration; and consisted of two distinct\r\nbodies--Grandjean’s Polish and German division, formerly attached to\r\nthe 1st Corps, and the bulk of the Prussian contingent under General\r\nGrawert. The operations of the corps were languid; it certainly\r\nwas not strong enough to besiege Riga; and Napoleon paid curiously\r\nlittle attention to it. It would almost seem as if his real object\r\nin constituting it at the last moment was to have the notoriously\r\ndisaffected Prussian contingent accompanied and watched by a competent\r\nforce of troops drawn from states which he regarded as devoted to him.\r\n\r\nThe 10th Corps, having swept the right bank of the Niemen, concentrated\r\non Rossieni, whence it set out on July 8th for Riga, Grawert advancing\r\ndirectly on the port by way of Mitau, while Grandjean’s division,\r\naccompanied by Macdonald, moved on the right. Before the 30,000 or\r\n32,000 men of the 10th Corps the Russian detachments in Kurland\r\nwere helpless, and fell back at all points into Riga. By the 18th\r\nthe invading forces were ranged along the Aa river, which passes by\r\nMitau, the capital of Kurland, and, flowing nearly parallel to the\r\nDüna, enters the Baltic some 20 miles west of Dünamunde. Mitau, Bausk,\r\nand the other towns along the Aa were occupied, and the Prussians\r\nreached out with their left to the sea. Essen could form for field\r\noperations only a force of 8 depôt battalions, 8 squadrons, a battery\r\nand some Cossacks--4500 men at most, with 10 guns--which he sent under\r\nLieutenant-General Lewis towards Bausk. Lewis was too late to defend\r\nMitau or Bausk, and took up a defensive position at Eckau between the\r\nlatter place and Riga. Against him Grawert advanced on July 19th\r\nwith 7 battalions, 4 squadrons and 4 batteries--5000 men and 32 guns.\r\nLewis was beaten with a loss of over 600 prisoners besides killed and\r\nwounded, and driven back upon Riga. The Prussians moved up nearer to\r\nthe city, and Essen, on July 22nd, losing his head, ordered the suburbs\r\nto be fired. There was absolutely no need for this reckless step.\r\nMacdonald had not a siege gun within reach. The misery and destitution\r\noccasioned were, of course, terrible; the mere immediate material loss\r\nis said to have been valued at 15,000,000 paper rúbles (about £600,000).\r\n\r\nMacdonald, after Eckau, moved with Grandjean’s division towards\r\nJakobstädt, and established his head-quarters there on the 22nd. His\r\nadvance-guard of 4 Polish battalions, under Prince Radziwil, moved down\r\nthe left bank of the Düna on Dünaburg. Radziwil occupied the place on\r\nthe 30th and 31st, the garrison having been withdrawn by Wittgenstein,\r\nand on August 8th Macdonald arrived with the rest of Grandjean’s\r\ndivision. He blew up the half-finished fortifications, and destroyed\r\nall the artillery, ammunition and tools which he could not carry away.\r\nDe Chambray blames him for this, saying that he should have retained\r\nthem for the siege of Riga; he also criticises him for not crossing the\r\nDüna and striking at Wittgenstein’s communications. It seems, however,\r\nclear that Macdonald’s appointed task was the siege of Riga; and he\r\nobviously could not undertake independent operations without Napoleon’s\r\norder. His position, as he told Oudinot, was very difficult. His force\r\nwas scattered over a wide extent of country, and in the absence of any\r\nproper staff he was burdened with petty details.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nMARSHAL OUDINOT, DUKE OF REGGIO\r\n\r\nCommander of the 2nd French Army Corps\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by Robert Lefèvre at Versailles]\r\n\r\nOn August 7th Essen made an attack on Schlock, the port at the mouth\r\nof the Aa, with 6 British and 13 Russian sloops and gunboats, and\r\nabout 1000 troops, all under General Lewis. Schlock was taken, but the\r\nlight craft could not pass the Prussian batteries on the Aa, and\r\nLewis abandoned Schlock and withdrew.\r\n\r\nOudinot, after his fruitless attack on the bridge-head of Dünaburg on\r\nJuly 13th, moved up the left bank of the Düna to join in the general\r\nadvance on Vitebsk. He also endeavoured to render the works at Drissa\r\nindefensible. Wittgenstein, realising that Macdonald and Oudinot could\r\nnot easily combine their operations, at first resolved to attack the\r\n2nd Corps as it passed up the Düna; but on receiving a report that\r\nMacdonald was bridging the river at Jakobstädt he took up a position\r\nnear Razitzi (? Pazitzi), about 16 miles from Druia on the road to\r\nSebezh, and awaited events.\r\n\r\nOudinot, moving up the left bank of the Düna, left Merle’s division,\r\nchiefly Swiss, and Corbineau’s brigade of light cavalry to watch the\r\nriver about Drissa, and with the rest of the 2nd Corps and Doumerc’s\r\nCuirassier division, occupied Polotsk on the 26th. On the 28th, leaving\r\na battalion at Polotsk, he advanced on Sebezh to cut Wittgenstein’s\r\ncommunications with St. Petersburg. He crossed the Drissa at Sivokhino\r\nand, early on the 30th, reached the hamlet of Kliastitzi, some 34\r\nmiles from Sebezh. As he was very badly informed as to Wittgenstein’s\r\nmovements he decided to halt and send out reconnaissances.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Wittgenstein, informed of Oudinot’s advance, had determined\r\nto attack without delay. On the 30th he was within easy reach of\r\nOudinot’s left flank; and about four in the afternoon his advance-guard\r\ncame into contact with Legrand’s division at Jakubovo, about 2 miles\r\nwest of Kliastitzi, posted on a narrow front between two woods.\r\n\r\nWittgenstein had with him the whole 1st Corps and 6 depôt battalions,\r\nin all about 21,000 men and 96 guns, organised into a vanguard, under\r\nKulnev, 2 infantry divisions under Major-Generals Berg and Sazonov, and\r\na mixed division commanded by Major-General Kakhovski.\r\n\r\nKulnev, a fiery cavalry officer, at once attacked Legrand, sending to\r\nWittgenstein for reinforcements. Legrand was posted between the woods\r\non a front of apparently only 800 yards, half of which was occupied by\r\nthe mansion and hamlet of Jakubovo. Verdier and Doumerc were on the\r\nmain road, there being no room wherein to deploy. An obstinate action\r\nensued as reinforcements were thrown in on both sides and without\r\nany special success for either. Legrand’s narrow front, though it\r\nenabled him to concentrate his infantry, only permitted him to bring\r\ninto action twelve guns as against 36 Russian pieces. On the 31st\r\nWittgenstein, having collected his whole force, ordered a general\r\nattack. The fighting was very fierce. Jakubovo, defended by the 26th\r\nLéger, was taken and retaken; but on the whole the French held their\r\nown, and there was no sound reason for the retreat which Oudinot\r\nordered. He says that he feared for the security of his left flank,\r\nthreatened by an enemy twice as strong as himself! This latter idea\r\nis scarcely in accordance with his confident advance upon Sebezh.\r\nAt any rate, he evacuated Jakubovo and retreated across the Nitcha,\r\nsouthward to Sivokhino, pursued and harassed by the Russians who, not\r\nunnaturally, claimed the affair as a complete victory. Wittgenstein had\r\nactually engaged 18 battalions. He claimed to have taken 900 prisoners\r\nand much baggage, but the estimates of the French losses in the Journal\r\nof the 1st Corps are greatly exaggerated. The Russians, also, must have\r\nlost severely in the fierce fighting about the mansion of Jakubovo; and\r\nOudinot claimed 500 prisoners.\r\n\r\nAt Sivokhino Oudinot was rejoined by Merle’s division, coming from\r\nDrissa. He deliberately left the ford unguarded; and took up a position\r\na little to the southward at the hamlet of Oboiarzina, with his flanks\r\nthrown forward and his whole force skilfully concealed in the woods and\r\ngullies with which the country abounded.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak on the 1st of August the impetuous Kulnev was leading the\r\npursuit. He had with him some companies of sharpshooters, 7 infantry\r\nbattalions, 6 squadrons and a horse battery, with which he crossed\r\nthe ford and pushed forward into the sort of _cul-de-sac_ formed by\r\nOudinot’s position to the southward. The Marshal had more than 40 guns\r\nranged in a deep curve round the advancing Russian columns. As they\r\nopened fire Kulnev realised that something more serious than a mere\r\nrear-guard action was toward, and requested Sazonov, whose division\r\nwas following, to support him. Sazonov sent forward the Tula Regiment\r\nand a heavy battery at once, but it was too late. The vanguard was\r\noverwhelmed by a furious cross cannonade, and broke before the charge\r\nof Verdier’s and Legrand’s infantry. The reinforcements were swept away\r\nin the rout; and the Russians poured back through the ford in a wild\r\ncrowd of struggling men and horses, amid which the French fire made\r\nterrible havoc. Kulnev strove desperately to repair the consequences of\r\nhis fatal impetuosity, but in vain. He was following the retreat when\r\na cannon-ball shattered both his legs, ending at once his despair and\r\nhis life. He bade his aides carry away his orders and insignia--“lest\r\nthese French triumph over a Russian general”; and so passed a fiery and\r\nenthusiastic spirit who might have rendered his country good service.\r\n\r\nVerdier’s division, driving before it the broken Russians, pressed\r\nthrough the ford in hot pursuit. Wittgenstein, who was advancing with\r\nhis whole force, sent on Major-Generals Prince Iachvil and Helfreich to\r\nrally the vanguard, and took up a position at the hamlet of Golovitzi\r\nto sustain it, with 48 guns ranged before his line. Berg’s division was\r\non the right and Kosakovki’s on the left. As soon as the remains of the\r\nvanguard had passed behind the batteries they opened a heavy cannonade,\r\nand Berg and Kozakovski moved forward to the attack. Wittgenstein’s\r\nsecond line, under Sazonov, also moved forward, and as the leading\r\ndivisions diverged somewhat in their advance some of its battalions\r\nfilled up the gap thus opened. Verdier, assailed by a greatly superior\r\nforce, was unable to bear up against it; and was driven back, fighting\r\nhard but losing heavily, to Sivokhino, where he repassed the Drissa,\r\ncovered by Legrand’s division.\r\n\r\nThe losses of the 2nd Corps from July 30th to August 1st amounted\r\naccording to Oudinot’s returns (which appear trustworthy) to 464\r\nofficers and men killed, 2925 wounded, and 1596 prisoners and missing.\r\nThis was certainly a gaping chasm in an effective strength of about\r\n28,000 men; but the Russians admitted 4300 casualties, and again there\r\nwas no solid reason for the French retreat upon Polotsk next day.\r\nNapoleon was greatly annoyed, and expressed his angry astonishment at\r\nthe movement, which appeared to him entirely unnecessary. He ordered\r\nOudinot to resume the offensive and, on August 4th, directed St. Cyr,\r\nwith the 6th Corps, to reinforce him.\r\n\r\nWittgenstein on August 1st had been wounded, and had handed over the\r\ncommand to D’Auvray. The really indecisive nature of the fighting is\r\nshown by the fact that no attempt was made to pursue the French. On the\r\ncontrary, D’Auvray withdrew by his right towards Dünaburg, in order\r\nto rally Hamen’s detachment, which was now to join the 1st Corps. On\r\nAugust 7th he once more took position at Razitzi. He decided to cross\r\nthe Düna and to destroy Macdonald’s small force at Dünaburg; and to\r\nthis end was already bridging the river, when he was recalled by a\r\nfresh advance of Oudinot from Polotsk.\r\n\r\nSt. Cyr, with the suffering remains of the Bavarian infantry and\r\nartillery--about 12,000 bayonets--reached Polotsk on August 7. Apart\r\nfrom his feeling that his troops were being sacrificed, he was angry\r\nat his subordination to Oudinot. St. Cyr had, in truth, a far better\r\nright to the Marshal’s bâton, and nothing but Napoleon’s dislike for\r\nhim had hitherto deprived him of it. Oudinot, leaving the 6th Corps\r\nto follow, started westward from Polotsk with the 2nd on the 7th, and\r\non the 9th reached Valéinzi, 8 miles from Drissa. Next day D’Auvray\r\nmarched from Razitzi; and on the 10th the Russian advance-guard, now\r\nunder Helfreich, collided with Oudinot’s advance, consisting of his\r\nlight cavalry, supported by the 11th Léger, at Svolna, a few miles\r\nnorth of Valéinzi. D’Auvray arrived with his main body on the 11th.\r\nExpecting that Oudinot would advance in full force, he at first stood\r\non the defensive, but, finding that the bulk of the 2nd Corps remained\r\ninactive at Valéinzi, attacked the advance-guard and drove it back.\r\nThereupon, with curious timidity, Oudinot once more, on the 13th,\r\nretrograded to Polotsk, where he arrived on the morning of the 16th. On\r\nthe 13th Hamen joined the Russian 1st Corps, and next day Wittgenstein\r\nresumed the command.\r\n\r\nPolotsk, a place of much importance in the struggles between Poland\r\nand Russia during the 15th and 16th centuries, lies on the right bank\r\nof the Düna, at the point where it is joined by the little river\r\nPolota. The country around was in 1812 wooded to within a few miles of\r\nthe town. Polotsk was traversed from north-west to south-east by the\r\nRiga-Vitebsk high-road, to which that from St. Petersburg united itself\r\nsome miles out. From the south-west the Vilna road reached the town\r\nacross the Düna. A fourth road left the Riga highway on the right a\r\nlittle way from Polotsk, and ran north-eastwards to Nevel.\r\n\r\nThe advance-guard of the Russians came in contact with the French\r\noutposts during the afternoon of the 16th, and the sound of the firing\r\nbroke up a council-of-war which Oudinot had called to consider the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening the French troops took up position. Oudinot’s plan\r\nof action is difficult to understand. He left nearly the whole of\r\nVerdier’s and Merle’s divisions and the bulk of his cavalry on the\r\nleft bank of the Düna. On the right bank, along the Polota, stood St.\r\nCyr’s weak corps, with its right at the village of Spas, about a mile\r\nfrom Polotsk. Wrede’s division was in front line and Deroy in reserve.\r\nTo the left of the Bavarians were Legrand’s division, 1 regiment of\r\nVerdier’s, and Corbineau’s cavalry brigade. Oudinot’s whole force was\r\nover 35,000 strong, with about 130 guns.\r\n\r\nThe Russian 1st Corps and the reserve troops attached to it--the latter\r\nnow combined into regiments--totalled about 23,000 or 24,000 men and 99\r\nguns. It was distributed in three mixed divisions, under Major-Generals\r\nBerg, Sazonov and Kakhovski, and two mixed brigades commanded\r\nrespectively by Major-General Helfreich and Colonel Vlastov.[4]\r\n\r\nWittgenstein and his staff considered that Oudinot’s position about\r\nPolotsk was too strong, defended as it was by superior forces, to be\r\nattacked, and decided to confine themselves to a vigorous demonstration\r\nupon Spas to cover the bridging of the Düna and a raid on Oudinot’s\r\ncommunications. Early on the 17th, covered by Helfreich and Vlastov,\r\nthe Russian main body debouched from the woods and deployed. The\r\ndivisions as usual were broken up in the line of battle. In general,\r\nhowever, it may be said that Vlastov’s detachment formed the extreme\r\nleft opposite Spas, and thence Berg’s division and Helfreich’s vanguard\r\ncontinued the line towards the Düna. Sazonov and Kakhovski were in\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\nVlastov, and part of Berg’s division, under the general direction of\r\nPrince Iachvil, attacked Spas, which was gallantly defended by the\r\nBavarians. To sustain the attack Wittgenstein was obliged to direct\r\nto the left the rest of Berg’s division, replacing it by only two\r\nbattalions of his second line. Oudinot thereupon ordered Legrand to\r\nattack the weakened Russian centre, but after some sharp fighting\r\nthis was repelled by the advance of fresh battalions from Sazonov’s\r\ndivision. Legrand renewed his attacks, but was again forced to retire,\r\nbut to repulse him nearly the whole of Sazonov’s division had to be\r\nemployed. Around Spas a furious conflict raged all day, the Russian\r\nattacks being repelled time after time by a much smaller force of\r\nBavarians. The outlook for Oudinot was entirely promising; by night\r\nalmost all Wittgenstein’s army had been engaged and had been held at\r\nbay by the division of Legrand, about half of Wrede’s and one regiment\r\nof Verdier’s. All this time two strong divisions were inactive south\r\nof the Düna. It was probably fortunate that in the evening Oudinot was\r\nseverely wounded and forced to transfer the command to the stronger\r\nhands of St. Cyr.\r\n\r\nThe latter general made up his mind that the badly shaken morale of\r\nhis army, no less than the Emperor’s interests, imperatively demanded\r\na victory, and determined to give battle. But he was too wary to\r\ndeprive himself of the advantage of allowing the Russians to waste\r\ntheir strength against his defensive position before himself taking\r\nthe offensive. He therefore waited during the morning of the 18th for\r\nWittgenstein to come on. The latter, on his side, having driven Oudinot\r\nagain into Polotsk, decided to withdraw, his mission being to defend\r\nthe St. Petersburg road, and greatly overestimating the strength of the\r\nforce opposed to him. His troops were to commence their march at 9 p.m.\r\n\r\nSt. Cyr during the morning made a parade of retiring his trains and\r\nreserve parks through the town towards Vitebsk, while Merle and Verdier\r\nwere brought nearer to it as though to cover an evacuation. Some of\r\nthe cavalry also defiled along the southern bank of the Düna with\r\ntheir horses laden with forage. These devices do not appear to have\r\ntricked the Russian staff into the belief that Polotsk was about to be\r\nabandoned; but they did give it the impression that there was no fear\r\nof an attack. The Russian army lay bivouacked in the order in which\r\nit had fought on the 17th, and head-quarters were at the hamlet of\r\nPrizmenitza, only half a mile from Spas.\r\n\r\nSt. Cyr, finding that Wittgenstein did not show any sign of attacking,\r\nand doubtless marking the obvious unpreparedness of the Russians,\r\ndecided to take the offensive. About 2 p.m. Verdier’s division began\r\nto cross the Düna, screened from the sight of the Russians by the\r\nhouses of Polotsk and the high banks of the Polota. Merle, Doumerc, and\r\nCastex’s light cavalry followed. Meanwhile at Spas Deroy’s division\r\nrelieved Wrede’s, and a battery of 31 guns was massed at the village.\r\n\r\nSt. Cyr’s plan, as he defines it, was to smash Wittgenstein’s line by a\r\nheavy and concentrated attack of four infantry divisions advancing at\r\nthe double, Wrede’s Bavarians leading on the right, Deroy to their left\r\nrear, Legrand and Verdier in echelon on the left of Deroy, while the\r\ncavalry followed in support, and Merle’s division stood in reserve at\r\nPolotsk. St. Cyr in his report to Berthier says that he had intended to\r\ncommence the attack at 4 p.m., but the bringing up of the troops from\r\nthe left bank of the Düna proved a tedious operation; and it was not\r\nuntil nearly 5 that St. Cyr was able to give the signal to commence the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nThe French and Bavarian artillery opened a tremendous cannonade against\r\nthe unsuspecting Russians, with great effect, especially among two\r\nbatteries in advance of Prizmenitza, which lost nearly all their\r\nhorses, and had a number of guns and waggons disabled or blown up\r\nagainst the Bavarian artillery. Diebich skilfully placed some guns in\r\na battery on the extreme Russian left, which, being masked, caused\r\nconsiderable loss, but could not silence the far stronger array of\r\npieces ranged before Spas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST BATTLE OF POLOTSK\r\n\r\nGained by General St. Cyr (in succession to Marshal Oudinot wounded) on\r\n18th August, 1812]\r\n\r\nFor some reason which is not very apparent the infantry attack did not\r\ntake place immediately. Possibly St. Cyr hoped that the fire of his\r\n130 guns or thereabouts would soon demoralise the Russians, but he was\r\ndeceived. Wittgenstein’s troops fell quickly into their places in the\r\nline, and their artillery stoutly responded to the greatly superior\r\nmass of Franco-Bavarian batteries.\r\n\r\nAfter a cannonade of about an hour’s duration, Wrede moved forward,\r\nthreatening to turn the Russian left, while Deroy marched straight\r\nagainst Prizmenitza. Legrand’s division, however, moved forward rather\r\nslowly, and Verdier’s division (temporarily commanded by General of\r\nBrigade Valentin) was still farther to the rear. The result was that\r\nthe Russian resistance was by no means crushed by the impetus of a\r\ncombined charge. As the Bavarians advanced they screened the fire of\r\ntheir guns, and the Russian artillery was able to play heavily upon the\r\ninfantry. Deroy, a venerable officer respected by all, was mortally\r\nwounded as he directed his division, and the Bavarians, shaken by their\r\nlosses, began to give way. Legrand, now in line on their left, carried\r\nPrizmenitza, but was driven out again by Hamen with seven battalions of\r\nSazonov’s division. St. Cyr himself hastened to the front and directed\r\na fresh advance of Legrand against Prizmenitza, supported by Sieben’s\r\nbrigade of Deroy’s division. Wrede was directed to assume the command\r\nof the whole 6th Corps, and himself rallied and led on Deroy’s shaken\r\ntroops. The four French and Bavarian infantry divisions, now supported\r\nby Merle on the left rear, moved forward together, breaking down the\r\nobstinate resistance of the Russians and forcing them back into the\r\nwoods. The Russian cavalry charged repeatedly and brilliantly to cover\r\nthe retreat of their infantry, and the combined Guard regiment created\r\na panic in Corbineau’s brigade, and rode almost up to the walls of\r\nPolotsk. St. Cyr himself, who had been slightly wounded on the 17th\r\nand was obliged to use a carriage, was nearly captured, and the daring\r\nhorsemen were only checked by the fire of the reserve artillery.\r\nThey were fired into from all sides, and charged by one of Doumerc’s\r\nCuirassier regiments, but the survivors regained the Russian line,\r\nsorely diminished in numbers, but covered with glory. The Russian army,\r\nbadly defeated but by no means routed, made good its retreat during\r\nthe night to Sivokhino, where it halted. St. Cyr did not pursue. He\r\nwas not strong in light cavalry, and Corbineau’s brigade was obviously\r\ndemoralised. Still it seems that more use might have been made of\r\nMerle’s Swiss regiments, which had scarcely fired a shot; several of\r\nVerdier’s and Wrede’s regiments also had not been heavily engaged.\r\n\r\nThe losses on both sides had been very heavy. Wrede gave the Bavarian\r\nloss as 118 officers and 1161 men killed and wounded. That of the\r\n2nd Corps, which had 190 officers _hors de combat_, can hardly have\r\nbeen less than 3500. The Russians admitted a loss of 5000 killed and\r\nwounded. St. Cyr claimed 1000 prisoners; and 14 Russian guns were\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\nOn the French side General Deroy was mortally wounded. Oudinot, St.\r\nCyr, Verdier and Wrede were wounded. Of the brigade leaders the\r\nBavarian Sieben was killed, and two French and two Bavarians wounded.\r\nThe Russians had Generals Berg, Kozakovski and Hamen wounded.\r\n\r\nPolotsk was hardly a very glorious victory, St. Cyr having some 35,000\r\nmen on the field against Wittgenstein’s 23,000 or 24,000 at most, but\r\nit had important results in freeing Napoleon from anxiety for his\r\nleft flank. He showed his satisfaction by at last giving St. Cyr his\r\nMarshal’s bâton.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Klengel gives his whole strength as only 1985; but he had\r\nobvious motives for minimising the disaster. The figures given in the\r\ntext are confirmed by the muster-rolls of the 7th Corps.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: For Plan see Appendix.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSMOLENSK TO BORODINO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe battle of Lubino concluded the bloody fighting about Smolensk;\r\nand, though there was practically no pause in the operations, it\r\nmarked the term of another stage in the campaign, as poor in results\r\nas the preceding ones. At Vilna the Russians had deliberately refused\r\nto fight, and had withdrawn out of reach. At Vitebsk they had almost\r\naccepted the chance of battle, but then, on better information, had\r\nslipped out of their great opponent’s closing grasp in the nick of\r\ntime. At Smolensk it seemed that the desired great battle would at\r\nlast be delivered and elusive victory crown the eagles of Napoleon.\r\nWhatever be thought of the wisdom of the Emperor’s manoeuvres, they\r\nhad been admirably carried out, and his troops had fought splendidly.\r\nYet the results of the great effort had been completely negative. The\r\nRussian army had wrought its way out of the great conqueror’s clutches,\r\nand had inflicted decidedly more damage that it had itself received. A\r\nfew guns, a few prisoners and a ruined and nearly deserted city--these\r\nconstituted the poor reward of so much skill and courage.\r\n\r\nIt may be regarded as certain that Napoleon had originally intended\r\nto conclude the campaign of 1812 at Smolensk. When he first began to\r\ncontemplate a change of plan cannot be determined, but it is possible\r\nthat it was at a comparatively early period of the campaign. The\r\nelusive strategy of his opponents cannot but have kept before his\r\neyes the probability either of being forced to extend the area of\r\nhis operations, or of taking up winter-quarters with his self-imposed\r\ntask unfinished. Jomini points out that the fact that he did not then\r\ndisclose his purpose may merely indicate that he wished to encourage\r\nhis weary troops by the prospect of a speedy end of their toils. On\r\nthe other hand, it is highly probable that his decision was not formed\r\nuntil after the battle of Smolensk. The absolutely negative results\r\nof that engagement forced him to consider the necessity of pushing\r\non to strike a crushing blow. Had he succeeded in disorganising the\r\nmain Russian army by a heavy defeat he would probably have stayed his\r\nadvance, and devoted the rest of the campaigning season to solidly\r\norganising his communications, and crushing Tormazov and Wittgenstein.\r\n\r\nSo much for the time at which Napoleon decided to continue his advance.\r\nHis reasons fall under three headings--military, political and personal.\r\n\r\nNapoleon played many parts on the stage of history, but he was in the\r\nfirst instance and before everything a soldier. Military reasons may\r\ntherefore justly take priority of place. Since crossing the frontier\r\nin June he had kept steadily before him the crushing of the principal\r\nforces of Russia in a great battle. This purpose he had failed to\r\neffect. The Russian armies were yet unbroken, and had suffered,\r\nrelatively to their numbers, less heavily than their opponents. They\r\nwere retiring upon their resources, and, slow and difficult as was\r\nthe organisation of reinforcements, the Russian national spirit was\r\nthoroughly roused, and the vanguard of the new levies was beginning\r\nto reach the fighting line. But for the moment this fighting line was\r\nmuch weaker than the forces immediately under Napoleon’s command, and\r\nwould probably succumb to them in a pitched battle. Were it allowed\r\nto manoeuvre rearwards, and rally and assimilate the new levies which\r\nwere being collected and drilled, the chances of Napoleon’s success\r\nwould be greatly diminished. His lines of communication were already\r\ntroubled by Cossacks, and time would mean the increase of these\r\nvexatious irregulars both in numbers and efficiency, thus compelling\r\nlarger detachments and weakening the striking force upon which\r\neverything really depended. It was practically certain that the elusive\r\nRussians would never abandon “White-Walled Moscow” without a battle,\r\nand it was necessary to go forward to seek it while the striking force\r\nwas yet strong enough to deal a decisive blow. It would also appear\r\nthat the halt on the Düna and Dnieper had permitted the accumulation of\r\nsupplies sufficient to subsist the army as far as Moscow, at any rate\r\nwith the addition of what might be obtained by foraging.[5] Finally,\r\nthe victory of Schwarzenberg at Gorodeczna on August 12th, and that of\r\nSt. Cyr over Wittgenstein at Polotsk on the 17th and 18th, appeared to\r\nassure the immediate security of Napoleon’s flanks.\r\n\r\nPolitical reasons also must have weighed much with Napoleon. The\r\ncontinuance of his empire, as he himself probably understood better\r\nthan anyone, depended upon continued military success. His own position\r\nrested almost solely upon the force of his own personality. To remain\r\nfor several months, perhaps a year, away from France might lead to his\r\ndownfall. Moreover, whatever the dynasts might say or do, Germany was\r\nfull of discontent; and in his absence revolt might break out in his\r\nrear. To confess failure by a retreat was not to be contemplated. In\r\nshort, there was practically no alternative to an advance.\r\n\r\nTo the influence exercised by sound military and political argument\r\nmust be added that of Napoleon’s personality. He had never yet\r\nexperienced failure so far as his own personal enterprises had been\r\nconcerned, and exasperated as he was by the lack of success, up to the\r\npresent, of the campaign, every prompting of his fierce and impetuous\r\nnature impelled him to go forward.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Russians--in so far as there was any public\r\nopinion in Russia--were by no means contented with the progress of\r\nthe campaign. Alexander, before leaving the army, had issued two\r\nproclamations, one to the people at large, the other to the city of\r\nMoscow, calling upon the nation to make great efforts to expel the\r\ninvaders. He then hastened to Moscow, where, on July 27th, an assembly\r\nof nobles and merchants was convoked under the presidency of the\r\nGovernor-General, Count Rostopchin. The nobles offered for war a levy\r\nof one man in ten from the population of their estates. The merchants\r\nvolunteered a contribution by an assessment upon the capital of each;\r\nand a special subscription opened on the spot realised in an hour\r\nnearly £200,000. In the midst of these enthusiastic proceedings the\r\nTzar entered the assembly, and ended a speech, in which he set forth\r\nthe national peril, by a declaration that he intended to continue the\r\nstruggle until the bitter end.\r\n\r\nAlexander wisely restricted the new levies to provinces which were\r\nnot yet the seat of war. He also decided that a proportion of 2 per\r\ncent. generally, and 1 per cent. in Siberia, would be sufficient.\r\nMen were not lacking, but arms and equipment were deficient, so also\r\nwere officers capable of organising and training the new recruits.\r\nThe collection of the levies was an operation requiring much time and\r\ntrouble: it was even more difficult to realise the money contribution,\r\npart of which was not finally received until the following year. But\r\nconsidering the vast extent and poverty of the empire the immediate\r\nresults were exceedingly creditable. We shall soon have occasion to\r\nnote the rapid strengthening of the Russian army.\r\n\r\nWith all this enthusiasm and patriotic endeavour there was not\r\nunnaturally mingled a good deal of distrust and discontent among the\r\nnobles, who voiced such public opinion as existed. These feelings were\r\njustified to a great extent by the foolishness of the Government,\r\nwhich reported non-existent military successes, and misrepresented the\r\noperations which were in progress. A certain amount of reliable news,\r\nhowever, filtered through from the front. It gradually became clear\r\nthat, despite the so-called successes of the Russians, the armies were\r\nsteadily retreating, and that cities and provinces were being abandoned\r\nto the invader.\r\n\r\nThe general results of all this was a more or less openly expressed\r\ndesire that the conduct of the war should be changed. To a certain\r\nextent it was the outcome of genuine conviction that the command might\r\nbe in better hands, but it was also largely the reflection of the\r\ninsubordinate discontent among the army officers, which had reached\r\nits height at Smolensk. The outcry was chiefly against Barclay, whose\r\nforeign name was made the platform for every kind of unjust accusation.\r\nIt appears to have chiefly been the sentiments of Bagration and his\r\nadherents which made themselves heard in the capital. Barclay had\r\nfew friends--Löwenstern says that Konovnitzin was almost the only\r\ngeneral officer attached to him--and had neither leisure nor talents\r\nfor defending his reputation against intriguers. Alexander apparently\r\nalways trusted and liked him; but on the abandonment of the offensive\r\nearly in August the clamour became so loud that he was constrained\r\nto give way, though he angrily declared that he would not assume\r\nresponsibility for any evil consequences. He appointed a committee\r\nconsisting of Arakcheiev, the Vice-Chancellor Count Kotschubey, and\r\nPrince Lopukhin, to consider the question of a different conduct of the\r\nwar. The action was probably merely nominal, for both the remedy and\r\nthe man to apply it had been practically agreed upon. The committee\r\nmet on the 17th of August. It recommended the appointment of a\r\ncommander-in-chief of all the Russian field armies, and for the post\r\nsubmitted to the Tzar the name of General Prince Golénischev-Kutuzov.\r\n\r\nThere were practically only two candidates for the onerous position.\r\nOne was Kutuzov. The other was Bennigsen, who in his own estimation\r\nwas fully equal to the responsibility. Others, however, did not think\r\nso highly of his merits, or of those of his campaign of 1807 against\r\nNapoleon. Alexander knew him as one of his father’s assassins, and\r\nprobably distrusted his vain and selfish character. Besides, he was a\r\nforeigner. Kutuzov’s military reputation was estimated as highly as\r\nBennigsen’s; his laurels were recent; and, above all, he was a native\r\nRussian, popular with the army and believed to be the exponent of the\r\nhard-fighting tactics of far-famed Suvórov.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th Alexander nominated Kutuzov to the position of\r\ncommander-in-chief. Bennigsen was appointed chief-of-staff. The reasons\r\nare somewhat obscure. Clausewitz considers that Bennigsen procured\r\nhis appointment in the hopes of succeeding to Kutuzov’s place if, as\r\nseemed not unlikely, the old man’s health should break down. Bennigsen\r\nhimself says that, at Vilna, Barclay informed him that Alexander wished\r\nto employ him again. It is possible that Alexander appointed him in\r\nview of such a contingency as Clausewitz suggests; certainly he was\r\nsenior to all the generals with the army, so that, in the event of\r\nKutuzov’s retirement, he would naturally assume the command. He seems\r\nto have regarded himself rather as his chief’s colleague than his\r\nassistant. Kutuzov did not take his appointment very kindly, and the\r\nyoking together of the two veterans, one a Russian noble and the other\r\na German soldier of fortune, was not a happy expedient.\r\n\r\nWhile at Smolensk, Napoleon regulated his main line of communications,\r\nwhich was now to run by Vilna, Minsk, Borisov and Orsha, to Smolensk.\r\nSmolensk became the advanced depôt of the army, and Vitebsk being of\r\nonly secondary importance, Charpentier was transferred to the former\r\nplace with the greater part of his garrison. Winzingerode, however,\r\nwas so active in the neighbourhood of Vitebsk that on the 21st\r\nNapoleon detached Pino’s Italian division thither to support Pajol.\r\nThe alarm was a false one, for Winzingerode had, as we know, only a\r\nweak detachment of cavalry. On receiving intelligence of the retreat of\r\nthe Russian main army he fell back towards Moscow, and Napoleon called\r\nPino, Pajol and Guyon towards him, but only the cavalry were able to\r\nrejoin in time for the battle of Borodino.\r\n\r\nOrders were given to construct bakeries at Smolensk, and to form\r\nmagazines and hospitals. The city, however, was little better than a\r\nheap of ruins. Nearly all the inhabitants had fled, and artificers and\r\nmaterials were lacking to carry out the works ordered by Napoleon. It\r\nis a favourite saying of the Emperor’s apologists that his orders were\r\nneglected. The truth is that they were too frequently impracticable.\r\nThe hospitals, choked with some 15,000 sick and wounded, were in a\r\nfrightful condition. So great was the dearth of supplies that the\r\nparchment of the city archives and gun-waddings were utilised for\r\nbandages.\r\n\r\nNor was the condition of the army at large satisfactory. Food was for\r\nthe moment sufficient; but clothing and equipment were already wearing\r\nout. Nansouty declared that he had never seen cavalry in so wretched\r\na condition as his own 1st Corps; there were Cuirassiers half naked.\r\nThe number of broken-down horses was alarmingly large. Discipline was\r\nworse than ever. Napoleon declared in a moment of depression that\r\ntwo-thirds of the army were stragglers. There was small prospect of\r\nthese evils being remedied. The army, having made an all too brief\r\nhalt about Vitebsk and Orsha, and a yet briefer one at Smolensk, was\r\nabout to be pushed forward for another 250 miles. Napoleon had, in a\r\nsense, provided for everything; that is, he had issued orders which\r\nanticipated most contingencies. But De Fezensac, himself a soldier of\r\nmerit, puts his finger on the weak point of the elaborate arrangements,\r\nand sums up the situation in a single damning paragraph: “Mais il\r\nne suffit pas de donner des ordres, il faut que ces ordres soient\r\nexécutables; et avec la rapidité des mouvements, la concentration des\r\ntroupes sur un même point, le mauvais état des chemins, la difficulté\r\nde nourrir les chevaux, comment aurait-il été possible de faire des\r\ndestributions régulières et d’organiser convenablement le service des\r\nhôpitaux?” The army swept the country through which it was moving\r\nclear in a few hours; it became literally and without exaggeration\r\na wilderness. Stores of every kind were being poured into Vilna and\r\npushed forward with all diligence to Minsk and Smolensk, but bad\r\nroads, lack of horses and sometimes mismanagement delayed the advance\r\nof the convoys. The main army, for whose benefit they were intended,\r\nwas constantly moving forward, and they could never attain it. When on\r\nOctober 19th, Napoleon turned back from Moscow his nearest considerable\r\nmagazine was at Smolensk, and it contained only six or seven days’\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nThere was depression and growing discontent among the generals.\r\nNapoleon noticed it and made angry and bitter comments thereupon. Ney\r\nalone seems to have been undaunted. Just after Lubino he wrote to the\r\nEmperor suggesting that an attempt should be made to overtake the\r\nRussians by three or four forced marches.\r\n\r\nIn the rear also events were far from answering to Napoleon’s\r\nexpectations. He complained bitterly that Lithuania did nothing. It\r\nwas to some extent true. Lithuania was a poor country; it had been\r\nwasted by the passage across it of the bulk of the _Grande Armée_,\r\nand it could furnish practically no supplies. The levies ordered\r\nby the provisional government existed largely upon paper, and the\r\ntroops actually enrolled were of very poor quality. Had Napoleon\r\nfrankly re-established the Kingdom of Poland better results might have\r\nbeen obtained, but it is not very probable. It is impossible, after\r\nreading his minute directions to De Pradt, his agent at Warsaw, and\r\nhis ambiguous replies to the Polish deputies who waited upon him at\r\nVilna, not to perceive that he was deliberately trading upon the hopes\r\nand enthusiasm of the Poles. Moreover, he had on entering Lithuania\r\ncommitted a blunder by proclaiming liberty to everyone. The serfs\r\nnaturally interpreted this as granting permission for plunder and\r\ngeneral licence. The nobles, whom Napoleon should certainly, from the\r\npoint of view of his own interests, have conciliated, were alienated,\r\nas were the Jews, who practically monopolised such trade and industry\r\nas existed. At best it can scarcely be said that Lithuania was actively\r\nfavourable to Napoleon. It was necessary to garrison the principal\r\ntowns and to escort all convoys as if the country had been hostile\r\ninstead of nominally friendly. For all practical purposes Napoleon’s\r\nbase continued to be on the Niemen and Vistula, and supplies had to be\r\nbrought up thence.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of August, apparently, Napoleon finally made up his mind\r\nto continue his advance, and on the 21st and 22nd the army was set\r\nin motion. Ney’s shattered corps could no longer fulfil the duties\r\nof support to the advanced guard, and Davout’s took its place. Murat\r\nled the way with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Corps of Cavalry, and the light\r\nhorse of the 1st and 3rd Army Corps. Behind Murat marched the 1st\r\nCorps, with Compans’ division leading; the 3rd and 8th Corps and the\r\nImperial Guard followed. The 4th Corps formed the left flank-guard; the\r\n5th and Latour-Maubourg’s Corps (less three Polish regiments left on\r\nthe Dnieper) that on the right. On the 23rd intelligence arrived that\r\nthe Russians had taken up a position for battle near Dorogobuzh, 22\r\nmiles east of Solovievo. Eugène and Poniatowski were drawn in towards\r\nthe centre and the muster-rolls called. They showed an effective\r\nstrength of 147,000 men, of whom 31,000 were cavalry, with nearly 590\r\nguns--exclusive of the head-quarters troops.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Lubino Barclay had sent forward Toll to look for a\r\nfavourable field of battle. While the First Army was marching to\r\nSolovievo, Bagration moved on towards Dorogobuzh. Toll, who was\r\naccompanied by Clausewitz, found a position, which he considered\r\nsatisfactory, about 5 miles west of the town, behind the small river\r\nUzha, which here flowed into the Dnieper from the south. It was open\r\nin front, giving free play to the action of the powerful Russian\r\nartillery, and woods behind afforded cover for reserves. On the right,\r\nhowever, a hill beyond the Uzha commanded part of the main position,\r\nand thus appeared to Barclay and Bagration, who met to confer, a\r\ncardinal defect. Barclay, whose temper had probably scarcely been\r\nsoftened by persecution, blamed Toll, and the latter, always gruff to\r\nthe verge of rudeness, growled a reply to the effect that he could not\r\n_make_ positions--if they were not to be _found_ that was the fault of\r\nthe country. Barclay, recognising that there was reason in the answer,\r\nif little courtesy, refrained from an angry reply; but Bagration was\r\nfurious, and his natural generosity impelled him to praise the very man\r\nwhom he had recklessly assailed.\r\n\r\n“If you cannot choose positions,” he told the luckless young\r\nQuartermaster-General, “that is not to say that others cannot! How\r\ndare you, you unlicked cub, address the commander-in-chief so? He owes\r\nhis position to his great qualities, and deserves every consideration.\r\nI am his senior, but I set the example by serving under him. You and\r\nyour blue riband! (Toll was a Knight of St. Andrew.) You think that\r\nyou honour him by serving under him; but it is the other way about.\r\nIt is disgraceful that a young swelled-head like you should hold such\r\nlanguage towards the man on whom depends the fate of the army and the\r\nempire. Thank his generosity that worse does not befall you, for if\r\nI had my way I would change that blue riband for a common soldier’s\r\nbelts!”\r\n\r\nThe threat was by no means an empty one, for a Russian\r\ncommander-in-chief had power to degrade officers to the ranks.\r\nBagration’s words certainly afford food for reflection, seeing his\r\nremarks of a few days since, but it is good to know that one of the\r\nlast actions of his honourable life was to endeavour to make some\r\namends to his ill-used colleague.\r\n\r\nThe position being deemed unfavourable, Bagration suggested another in\r\nfront of Dorogobuzh. Clausewitz describes this--perhaps partly out of\r\npique--as very bad. It at any rate appears that it was intersected by\r\nthe Dnieper, though the river was not here a very formidable obstacle.\r\n\r\nThe rear-guard, under Platov, consisting of 3 regiments of Hussars, 1\r\nof Lancers, 6 of Chasseurs and some Cossacks, had on the 22nd a brisk\r\naction with Murat, rejoining the main army on the 23rd. On the same\r\nday Napoleon himself left Smolensk, and Eugène and Poniatowski were\r\ncalled in. Poniatowski’s march to the south of the road indicated an\r\nintention to turn the Russian left; and Bagration counselled a retreat.\r\nIt seems obvious that he had at last definitely ranged himself on the\r\nside of Barclay. His example may have served to improve the sense of\r\nsubordination among the other generals. It had fallen so low that\r\nPlatov personally insulted Barclay a few days after the evacuation of\r\nSmolensk. The position was evacuated in the night of the 23rd-24th and\r\nthe retreat continued, the main body retiring to Brazhino on the Moscow\r\nroad, Baggohufwudt and Uvarov proceeding level with it on the north\r\nbank of the Dnieper. The rear-guard fell back to Dorogobuzh.\r\n\r\nBarclay’s resolution to give battle before Dorogobuzh was bold to the\r\nverge of rashness. His entire strength was probably not more than\r\n107,000 men, of whom 3000 were raw militia-men from the province of\r\nSmolensk, and certainly neither of the positions in advance of the town\r\nwas strong enough to compensate for a numerical inferiority of 40,000\r\nmen. It almost appears as if he had grown desperate at the persecution\r\nto which he was subjected, and had resolved to stake everything on a\r\nsingle throw of the dice.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th the two armies reached Viasma. Napoleon on the same day\r\nwas at Slavkovo, about 27 miles westward. There was a rear-guard\r\nfight between Murat and Platov, as the result of which the latter,\r\nto avoid being turned, retired to Semlevo, nearer Viasma. Platov,\r\nbeing indisposed, was succeeded by Konovnitzin. On the 28th Napoleon\r\nentered Semlevo; and on the 29th Barclay and Bagration reached\r\nTzarévo-Zaïmichi. On the same day General Miloradovich was at Gzhatsk\r\nwith 14,466 infantry and 1123 cavalry--depôt troops, convalescents and\r\nrecruits. Barclay and Bagration now decided that with this reserve\r\nforce within reach, they might safely stand to fight, and took up a\r\nposition. It appears to have been fairly strong in the centre, but,\r\nlike most positions in Central Russia, its flanks were exposed. This\r\nweakness the generals proposed to remedy by entrenchments. In the\r\nevening Kutuzov arrived and assumed the supreme command.\r\n\r\nKutuzov decided not to give battle in the Tzarévo-Zaïmichi position.\r\nThe decision was a perfectly sensible one. The responsibility was now\r\nhis, and he as yet knew nothing of his army. He would naturally desire\r\nto become better acquainted with it, and as it was still some 130 miles\r\nfrom Moscow he might hope to find a stronger position. Toll and his\r\nstaff were sent on ahead, and the army resumed its retreat, Konovnitzin\r\nwith a force now augmented to 26 battalions and 72 squadrons\r\ncovering the rear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nGENERAL OF CAVALRY COUNT PLATOV\r\n\r\nAtaman of the Don Cossacks]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the French were doggedly following, suffering much from\r\nfatigue and heat, and troubled, as usual, by internal dissensions.\r\nDavout accused Murat, apparently with great justice, of wasting the\r\ncavalry, and exhausting them by useless manoeuvres and lack of proper\r\ncare for their subsistence. He said that it wrung his heart--not a\r\nvery tender organ--to see the wretched state of the reserve cavalry\r\ndivisions, and declared that he would not allow his infantry to be so\r\nover-worked. Matters came to a head on August 28th in an open quarrel\r\nbetween the two leaders in Napoleon’s presence. Murat retorted to\r\nDavout’s accusation by a counter-charge of over-caution, and declared\r\nthat they had better settle their differences by a duel! Napoleon\r\nrather added fuel to the flames, for he insinuated that had Murat been\r\nin Davout’s place in July he might have intercepted Bagration. Davout\r\nwas also on bad terms with Berthier. There is no discovering the real\r\ncause of this, but it is certain that Davout’s fierce temper and rough\r\nmanners made him many enemies.\r\n\r\nThe march of the army was toilsome. The wide road was occupied by\r\nthe artillery and trains, five or six vehicles abreast, while along\r\nboth sides tramped the infantry in heavy columns of companies or\r\n“divisions.” They suffered much from heat, which was aggravated by the\r\ndense clouds of dust raised by the marching columns; and the supply\r\nof water was scanty. Even the Russians occasionally felt the want of\r\nit, and it was naturally worse for the French, who found the wells\r\ndrunk dry and the streams trodden into mud. At the same time it does\r\nnot appear that the diminution in the ranks owing to these causes was\r\nexceptional, though it was certainly serious. The worst losses were\r\namong the horses, which suffered at once from lack of proper forage and\r\nfrom thirst. Corn and hay became more and more difficult to procure,\r\nand the rations of the unfortunate animals were made up with rye straw.\r\nThe wastage among them was all the more serious because there was\r\nlittle hope of being able to replace them.\r\n\r\nThe villages along the route, and the few small towns, were\r\nfor the most part deserted by their inhabitants, and in\r\npart at least destroyed. This was not invariably the case.\r\nDorogobuzh--“Cabbage-town,” as the French soldiers called it from the\r\ncabbage fields amid which it lay--was uninjured, and three months later\r\nstill contained some of its inhabitants. Gzhatsk also was uninjured.\r\nViasma was partly destroyed, owing to fire spreading from a depôt of\r\nflour and spirits which the Russians had fired before retreating.\r\nOtherwise it is difficult to decide whether the destruction of houses\r\nand villages was due to French or Russians. It may be attributed to\r\nboth at various times according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe Russians retired eastward through Gzhatsk, covered by their\r\npowerful rear-guard. On September 1 they were about Kolotskoï, a\r\ngreat monastery about 75 miles from Moscow, the rear-guard being a\r\nday’s march behind. At Kolotskoï Toll and Vistitski II, Bagration’s\r\nQuarter-master-General, recommended a defensive position at Borodino,\r\na few miles farther on--probably in despair of being able to find\r\nanything better between it and Moscow. Napoleon either learned on the\r\nsame day that the Russians had definitely turned to bay, or inferred\r\nthat they were about to do so, for he stayed his advance at Gzhatsk\r\nin order to rally his forces for the impending struggle. The musters\r\nfor the 2nd of September, including men temporarily detached or\r\nstraggling who might rejoin within two or three days, and exclusive of\r\nhead-quarter troops, showed nearly 135,000 sabres and bayonets. Two\r\nbattalions of the 8th Corps were garrisoning Dorogobuzh and Viasma.\r\nBefore the battle Napoleon was rejoined by Pajol’s division and by the\r\n1st and 12th Light Cavalry Brigades--nearly 4000 sabres in all. For\r\nthe head-quarters troops 3000 is a conservative estimate.\r\n\r\nNapoleon made great efforts at this time to grapple with the disorder\r\nin his rear, and especially to reduce the vast trains of vehicles which\r\nimpeded the march. There is abundant evidence that they were out of all\r\nproportion to the strength of the army, and the superfluity consisted\r\nchiefly of private carriages. Napoleon’s efforts produced little\r\neffect. He issued stringent orders, and himself directed the firing of\r\nsome vehicles; but Baron Girod tells of at least one instance in which\r\nthe fire was extinguished as soon as the Emperor’s back was turned, and\r\nin general the order remained a dead letter.\r\n\r\nDuring the halt there was a good deal of rain, which did not improve\r\nthe indifferent roads, but relieved the distress for water. The 4th,\r\nhowever, was fine, and early in the morning the French army resumed\r\nits advance. The order was as before, but, to Davout’s disgust,\r\nCompans’ division was placed under Murat’s direct orders. A provisional\r\nbattalion of the Vistula Legion was left to garrison Gzhatsk.\r\nKonovnitzin made a stand at Gridnevo, about half-way to Borodino,\r\nwithdrawing when Murat’s infantry turned his flank, his cavalry\r\nskirmishing steadily with the leading French squadrons. On the 5th he\r\nmade another stand at Kolotskoï, and it was not until he saw Eugène’s\r\ncorps marching past his right flank that he fell back into the main\r\narmy behind the Kolotza.\r\n\r\nThe Borodino position has often been spoken of as an admirable one\r\nfor defence. Clausewitz, who knew it, is of a very different opinion;\r\nand in all probability it was selected simply because there was no\r\nlikelihood that anything better would present itself in the endless\r\nplain-lands. It had one grave strategic defect. Some way to the west\r\nthe great road forks, the branches uniting again at Mozhaïsk, about 6\r\nmiles east of Borodino. It was therefore necessary to hold two roads\r\ninstead of one, and to be strong on both. At Borodino they are 2-1/2\r\nmiles apart, the new road, on which Borodino stands, lying to the north.\r\n\r\nThe Kolotza rivulet makes a very acute angle with the new road, running\r\nfor a considerable distance nearly parallel with it, always in a gully\r\nwith steep banks. After passing Borodino, which lies on its left bank,\r\nit flows north-eastward with a very sinuous course to join the Moskva,\r\nabout 2-3/4 miles farther on. The Moskva itself flows south-eastward to\r\nthe high-road at the village of Uspenskoïe, three miles from Borodino,\r\nwhere it turns eastward towards Mozhaïsk.\r\n\r\nIn the angle formed by the two streams lies a low partly wooded\r\nplateau, its base formed by a rivulet which joins the Kolotza at\r\nBorodino. At its south-western angle stood the hamlet of Gorki, about\r\na mile from Borodino. A few hundred yards higher up another streamlet\r\njoined the Kolotza from the south-east. This streamlet, called after\r\nthe hamlet of Semenovskoï, about a mile and a quarter south of\r\nBorodino, flows in a little ravine, and the ground between it and\r\nthe Gorki rivulet forms another low plateau, not more than 30 feet\r\nhigh, but with a fairly steep western drop. It descends very slightly\r\ntowards the east for about a mile, until it is crossed by another brook\r\nflowing in a gully. The eastern bank of this gully is the higher, and\r\nthe ground extends eastward in another low plateau on which lies the\r\nvillage of Tzarévo, a mile and a half east of Semenovskoï. Just west\r\nof Gorki there is a low knoll, and another a mile due south-east of\r\nGorki, and about 1100 yards north of Semenovskoï. From Semenovskoï to\r\nthe old road at the village of Utitza is about a mile and a quarter,\r\nand from the latter village extended northward for about 1000 yards a\r\nthick wood. Three-quarters of a mile east of Utitza is a knoll, and\r\na little eastward again another low plateau. South of the old road\r\nextended marshy woods, though a little south of Utitza there was a\r\nclearing round the hamlet of Michino. Patches of wood were scattered\r\nover the whole position. The villages were all log-built and useless\r\nfor defence. From Utitza by Borodino to the junction of the Kolotza\r\nwith the Moskva is a distance of almost 5 miles.\r\n\r\nTo the west of the Borodino-Utitza line the country is of the same\r\ncharacter, only slightly lower. At the village of Shevardino, a mile\r\nwestward from Semenovskoï, is a low knoll. The villages were of so\r\nlittle consequence that it is superfluous to name them.\r\n\r\nIt will probably be gathered from this description that the general\r\nposition afforded no great advantages to the weaker side. Clausewitz,\r\nindeed, says that in places it was difficult to tell which had the\r\nadvantage of the ground. The northern plateau was fairly advantageous\r\nfor defence, but the Kolotza ravine in its front prevented the troops\r\nposted on it from making counter-attacks. The old road afforded\r\nopportunities to an enterprising foe of a turning movement. It was\r\ntherefore necessary to hold it strongly, but the wood south of\r\nSemenovskoï almost cut the troops about Utitza from the main line\r\nfarther north. Bennigsen criticises the whole position most bitterly,\r\nas far too extended, but represents it as being 2 miles longer than\r\nit really was. He was himself an advocate of very narrow positions,\r\nand French critics declared that his line at Eylau was far too close\r\nand heavy. He says in his memoirs that he perfectly understood\r\nthat Napoleon’s concentrated attacks could only be repulsed by a\r\nconcentration of defence. In principle he was no doubt right, but\r\nthe defensive concentration, as Wellington had been teaching an\r\nunappreciative Europe for years, should have been one of effective\r\nmuskets, not of crowded columns. Bennigsen was too self-satisfied to\r\nsee this; but it is perhaps fair to add that probably the British army\r\nwas the only one in Europe sufficiently highly trained to execute\r\nlinear tactics. The Russian soldiers were extremely steady and accurate\r\nin manoeuvre, but not rapid, and scarcely highly trained; French\r\nobservers criticise their clumsiness. Clausewitz thinks that the\r\nreserves were too near the front. The bulk of the army was massed on a\r\nfront of four miles; both flanks were covered by Cossacks.\r\n\r\nThe Kolotza entered the Moskva amid marshy ground; the right was\r\naccordingly supported on a wood a mile and a half further south. In\r\nfront of this and on its left towards Gorki were various field works.\r\nIn front of Gorki was a parapet with redans, and on the knoll south of\r\nBorodino a large earthwork, called by the French the “Great Redoubt.”\r\nSemenovskoï had been destroyed, the houses being mere shell traps.\r\nAt its western end a parapet had been marked out, and to the south\r\nthree _flèches_ or redans. The Gorki work, the Great Redoubt and the\r\nSemenovskoï redans were the only entrenchments at all complete, and\r\nthey were very hastily finished and of poor profile. Engineers and\r\nsappers were few in the Russian army, and tools seem to have been\r\nlacking.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the army gathered to defend this very mediocre position\r\ncannot be exactly estimated. Russian figures vary, and none seem to be\r\naccurate in details. Bogdanovich, for example, reckons 14,500 artillery\r\nand sappers present, which, allowing for 1000 of the latter, gives an\r\naverage of 250 per battery--more than in June!\r\n\r\nThe only very certain fact about the Russian strength is that when the\r\narmy reached Gzhatsk it cannot have contained much over 100,000 men,\r\nof whom 3000 were militia and 7000 Cossacks. Miloradovich’s 15,500 men\r\nwere drafted into the regiments, presumably with a view to bringing\r\nthem up as far as possible to equal strength. On the 4th the army was\r\njoined by 7000 militia from Moscow under Count Markov, the vanguard of\r\nthe great national levy. The total may be fairly estimated at nearly\r\n125,000 men. The militia were absolutely raw troops; some of them were\r\nmerely employed on police and fatigue duties. There were over 17,000\r\nexcellent regular cavalry, 7000 Cossacks, and 640 guns and howitzers,\r\nadmirably appointed and horsed.\r\n\r\nNapoleon had left perhaps 700 men in Gzhatsk, and allowing 1000 men\r\nfor casualties at Gridnevo and Kolotskoï, and 2000 for stragglers or\r\nmen who failed to rejoin, he had still over 131,000 men on the 5th\r\nof September, exclusive of the head-quarters guard, at least 3000\r\nmen, who must be counted as present no less than the Russian militia.\r\nBetween the 5th and 7th the army was reinforced by 4000 cavalry, giving\r\na total of 138,000 men available. There were about 32,000 cavalry,\r\nbut their superiority in numbers hardly compensated for the inferior\r\ncondition of the horses. The weight of metal thrown by the 584 guns\r\nwas slightly superior to that projected by the 640 opposing pieces;\r\nand the former--with the exception of the regimental artillery--were\r\nundoubtedly more efficiently served, but here also the horses were in\r\npoor condition.\r\n\r\nAfter the fight at Kolotskoï the French moved forward,--the main\r\ncolumn by the new road, Eugène to the left rear, Poniatowski by the\r\nold road on the right--Konovnitzin and his troops retiring steadily\r\nbefore them. The Russian army was not yet definitely ranged for battle,\r\nthe direction of Napoleon’s attack being still uncertain. Barclay,\r\nwith the 2nd, 4th and 6th Corps, was behind Borodino, Bagration about\r\nSemenovskoï with an advanced guard, under his second in command Prince\r\nGorchakov, at Shevardino, where a redoubt had been thrown up and armed\r\nwith 12 heavy guns. Gorchakov’s force comprised the 27th Division,\r\nSievers’ cavalry corps, the 2nd Cuirassier Division, and a light\r\ninfantry regiment from the 2nd Corps. The 3rd and 5th Corps, with the\r\nmilitia, were for the present held in reserve.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 3 p.m. that Konovnitzin retired from Kolotskoï, and\r\nprobably not before 5 that Murat attacked Gorchakov. The 3rd Chasseurs\r\nwere ejected from the hamlet of Doronimo by the 61st Regiment, which\r\nmarched at the head of Compans’ division; and the French infantry\r\nattacked the redoubt. It was a hastily constructed work; but the 27th\r\nDivision fought with steady determination and contested its possession\r\nfiercely, the cavalry co-operating by means of repeated charges, in\r\none of which the Russian Cuirassiers captured 5 guns. The position was\r\ntaken and retaken three times, and Bagration seems to have contemplated\r\nholding it definitely, for at 8 he relieved Neverovski’s troops by\r\nthe division of Karl of Mecklenburg. But by this time Poniatowski was\r\nwell advanced along the old Moscow road on the left; and about 10 p.m.\r\nBagration, by Kutuzov’s orders, withdrew to the main position. The\r\nlosses on both sides had been considerable. Bagration, who had exposed\r\nhimself in his usual reckless fashion, was slightly wounded, as were\r\nalso Gorchakov and St. Priest.\r\n\r\nThe French army was not yet fully concentrated, and Napoleon occupied\r\nthe 6th in reconnoitring the Russian position and arranging his plan of\r\nattack, while the troops already on the field rested. On the Russian\r\nside the army was placed in position, and the day was for the most part\r\nspent in religious exercises, culminating in the progress of the Virgin\r\nof Smolensk, which had been rescued from the city, through the camps.\r\n\r\nThe Russian commanders realised that they ran the risk of being turned\r\nby the old Moscow road. Tuchkov’s corps was therefore withdrawn from\r\nthe general reserve and posted at Utitza, with the Moscow militia\r\nbehind it in support, and 6 regiments of Cossacks under Karpov on its\r\nleft near Michino. On the plateau to the north of the new road were\r\nthe 2nd and 4th Corps, the 2nd on the right and the latter to the\r\nleft, near Gorki. Dokhturov, with a brigade of Voronzov’s Grenadiers\r\nattached, stood between Gorki and the Great Redoubt. Raievski’s weak\r\ncorps occupied the space between Dokhturov and Semenovskoï and\r\ngarrisoned the Great Redoubt, while the 8th Corps (less Voronzov’s\r\ndetached brigade) and the 27th Division held Semenovskoï and the\r\nredans. The wood between Borozdin’s left and Tuchkov was occupied by\r\n4 regiments of light infantry. Every corps had its Chasseur regiments\r\nthrown out in front. Borodino was garrisoned by the Chasseurs of the\r\nImperial Guard. Kutuzov and Bennigsen were stationed between Gorki and\r\nTzarévo, whence they could overlook nearly the entire field.\r\n\r\nBehind the first line stood the cavalry, each reserve corps having\r\nattached for the day a regiment of Corps-Hussars. Uvarov, having\r\nalso the Cossacks of the Guard, was with Baggohufwudt, Korff behind\r\nOstermann-Tolstoï, Kreutz (_vice_ Pahlen invalided) in rear of\r\nDokhturov, and Sievers behind Semenovskoï, with Duka’s Cuirassier\r\ndivision. Platov had 5 Cossack regiments watching the right flank,\r\nand 9 more in rear of the 2nd Corps. The 5th Corps, now under General\r\nLavrov, was at Tzarévo, with an artillery reserve of about 240 field\r\nand horse guns.\r\n\r\nThese dispositions have not escaped criticism. Clausewitz considers\r\nthat there were too many troops on the right, and as they had\r\neventually for the most part to be brought over to the left he was\r\nprobably correct. Bennigsen says that he saw that the left would be\r\nattacked in force, and that Bagration needed reinforcing. Both opinions\r\nhave rather the air of wisdom after the event, and the manoeuvre\r\nproposed by Clausewitz of forming a huge reserve, allowing Napoleon to\r\ndrive back Bagration, and then attacking his advancing line in flank,\r\nseems rather a hazardous one.\r\n\r\nThe Russian line comprised four sections. Miloradovich commanded the\r\n2nd and 4th Corps and the 1st and 2nd Cavalry Corps; Dokhturov the 6th\r\nCorps and the 3rd Cavalry Corps; Gorchakov the 7th and 8th Corps and\r\nSievers’ cavalry; and Tuchkov the 3rd Corps and the Moscow militia.\r\nFinally, Barclay was in charge of the right half of the line, Bagration\r\nof the left. This multiplicity of generals was a nuisance. Barclay and\r\nBagration sent orders direct to the divisional and brigade commanders.\r\n\r\nThe precise part which Kutuzov took in the battle is uncertain: the\r\ngeneral impression is that he left Barclay and Bagration to direct the\r\nmovements of the troops, except in a few instances.\r\n\r\nIt is a little doubtful if the Russian commanders intended nothing but\r\na mere obstinate defensive. As has been already mentioned, Borodino\r\nwas garrisoned and the bridge left intact; and from Barclay’s actions\r\nand remarks, as recorded by Löwenstern, he seems to have contemplated\r\na counter-offensive on the right. The vigour of the French attack,\r\nhowever, in any case rendered this idea, if entertained, fruitless.\r\n\r\nAs regards the French plans, there is little information to be gathered\r\nfrom Napoleon’s orders, which merely provide in the simplest manner for\r\nmassing batteries and opening infantry attacks, after which directions\r\nwould be given according to circumstances. Poniatowski was to turn\r\nthe Russian left by the old Moscow road--a task for which he had not\r\nenough troops. Probably, owing to the interposing woods, the Russian\r\nforce on the old road had not been estimated at its real strength.\r\nDavout endeavoured to be allowed to make a strong flanking movement,\r\nbut Napoleon characterised it as too hazardous. Probably his real fear\r\nwas that the Russians would evacuate their position under its menace,\r\nand so rob him of the battle which he anxiously desired. The battle\r\nresolved itself into a general assault of the bulk of the French army\r\nupon the Borodino-Utitza line, which, to withstand the attacks upon\r\nit, was ultimately manned by the greater part of the Russian host. It\r\nis certain that Davout was in a state of sullen rage at the rejection\r\nof his advice, as well as at the fact that Morand and Gérard were\r\ndetached from the 1st Corps, and placed for the day under the orders of\r\nEugène.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was certainly unwell. To say that he had a cold appears little\r\nto those who do not reflect that a cold may be very troublesome.\r\nWhatever the precise degree of Napoleon’s sickness there can be no\r\ndoubt as to his lack of activity, and for a circumstance so remarkable\r\nthere must have been strong reasons. It was no small cause that could\r\nkeep the great conqueror, during a battle upon which his fortunes\r\ndepended, lying listlessly on a rug behind his line.\r\n\r\nDuring the 6th the French sappers raised three battery-emplacements in\r\nfront of the 1st, 3rd and 4th Corps, each for 24 guns; but they were\r\nplaced at too great a distance from the Russian line and played no part\r\nin the battle.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 6th-7th was foggy. Early on the 7th, while the\r\ntroops were forming, the usual Imperial proclamation was read by the\r\nColonels. It was a brief and uninspiring document, which can hardly\r\nhave done much to raise the spirits of the men. De Chambray says that\r\nit was coldly received. Kutuzov’s proclamation, which was read to the\r\nRussian troops after the religious services on the 6th, was a much more\r\neffective production.\r\n\r\nThe French army was disposed in the following order from right to left.\r\nThe 5th Corps was on the old Moscow road. Davout, with the divisions of\r\nFriant, Compans and Desaix, stood opposite Borozdin’s position and the\r\nwood to its south. Ney continued the line to the Kolotza with Ledru’s\r\nand Razout’s divisions; the relics of Scheler’s Württemberg division,\r\nnow consolidated into only 3 battalions, were in reserve. North of the\r\nKolotza, communicating with the other troops by means of five trestle\r\nbridges, was Eugène with the 4th Corps (less Pino’s division), Morand’s\r\nand Gérard’s divisions, Grouchy’s cavalry corps and Preising’s Bavarian\r\nhorsemen.\r\n\r\nIn rear of Ney were the 8th Corps and Latour-Maubourg’s cavalry.\r\nNansouty’s cavalry corps supported Davout. The Imperial Guard, with\r\nMontbrun’s cavalry corps, just rejoined by its light division, formed\r\nthe general reserve, its final position being about the Shevardino\r\nredoubt captured on the 5th, near which Napoleon stationed himself.\r\n\r\nAbout 6 a.m. the artillery of Davout’s corps, speedily supported by\r\nthat of Ney, began a furious cannonade of the Russian left centre. Very\r\nsoon afterwards Davout opened the infantry attack, sending forward\r\nCompans’ division against the Semenovskoï redans, while Ney supported\r\nby moving forward Ledru on Compans’ left. The Russian entrenchments\r\nwere so slight that there was little difficulty in entering, but to\r\nhold them was a very different matter. Redan No. 2 was carried by the\r\n24th Léger and the 57th of the line, but Voronzov, charging with his\r\nsix Grenadier battalions formed in square, supported by Neverovski and\r\nsome of Sievers’ dragoons, drove them out again, and the fight raged\r\nfiercely about the almost useless earthworks, which were taken and\r\nretaken as the generals on either side threw in reinforcements.\r\n\r\nBagration, seeing the heavy masses advancing against him, and fearing\r\nthat he would be overpowered, ordered Tuchkov to send Konovnitzin’s\r\ndivision (now commanded by Tuchkov IV, Konovnitzin being on Kutuzov’s\r\nstaff) from Utitza. This reinforcement was necessary, for by 8 Voronzov\r\nand Neverovski, no longer able to bear up against superior numbers,\r\nwere evicted from all three redans, Voronzov being wounded. Tuchkov\r\ncame up in time to rally the retreating battalions, and Bagration\r\npromptly led forward a fresh counter-attack which was successful in\r\nrecovering the lost position, though Compans was now supported by\r\nDesaix. Already the terrible “Battle of the Generals” was earning its\r\nname. Compans was disabled first, then Desaix, while Rapp, sent by\r\nNapoleon to succeed Compans, received four wounds in about an hour.\r\n\r\nOn the left Eugène had attacked Borodino with Delzons’ division of the\r\n4th Corps. The attack was made under cover of the mist which still hung\r\nover the field, and the village was carried with a rush. The Guard\r\nChasseurs lost 30 officers in a quarter of an hour, and were driven in\r\nwild confusion to and across the Kolotza. The bridge was taken, and the\r\n106th French Regiment poured across it in pursuit. The garrison would\r\nhave been destroyed but for the 1st Chasseurs, under Colonel Karpenko,\r\nwho hurried up to the rescue. Charged by them, and smitten by the fire\r\nof Ostermann-Tolstoï’s guns from the farther bank, the 106th lost\r\nheavily. General Plauzonne was killed as he endeavoured to rally it,\r\nand its remains were driven back across the stream. Karpenko’s charge\r\nwas stopped by the 92nd Regiment, but he succeeded in destroying the\r\nbridge. Eugène left Delzons to watch the Kolotza north of the village,\r\nplaced the Royal Guard in reserve, stationed the cavalry of the 4th\r\nCorps and Preising’s division, now united under General Ornano, to\r\ncover the left flank, and turned Morand’s, Gérard’s and Broussier’s\r\ndivisions, supported by Grouchy, against Dokhturov and Raievski.\r\n\r\nOn the right Poniatowski captured Utitza, held only by the outposts,\r\nwithout difficulty; but on the knoll beyond Tuchkov had massed a\r\nstrong force of artillery, supported by Strogonov’s division, while\r\nthe Chasseurs in the wood to the north brought a flanking fire to bear\r\nupon the Poles. Poniatowski ranged 40 guns in advance of the village,\r\nbut they failed to silence Tuchkov’s artillery, and for some hours the\r\naction in this quarter was reduced to cannonading and skirmishing.\r\n\r\nKutuzov, seeing that nearly the whole French army was moving against\r\nhis centre and left, about 7.30 a.m. ordered Baggohufwudt to march the\r\nbulk of his corps to the support of Bagration. But as the movement\r\nwould take some time, and Bagration appeared to need immediate\r\nsupport, the Ismailovski and Lithuanian Guards, some Grenadiers, and\r\na brigade of Cuirassiers, were sent forward, much to the disgust of\r\nBarclay, who held strong views about depleting reserves until the last\r\nmoment. He hurried to Kutuzov, and begged him not to use up the Guard\r\nuntil things became critical, and Kutuzov assented. His action during\r\nthe greater part of the battle indeed seems to have been confined to\r\napproving his lieutenants’ measures.\r\n\r\nDavout and Ney, after being forced from the redans, reformed their\r\ntroops for another assault. Friant’s division was called up in support,\r\nand Tharreau’s division of the 8th Corps sent forward by Napoleon\r\nagainst the wood to the south, from which the Russian light infantry\r\nwere keeping up a heavy fire. When the Westphalians began to penetrate\r\nthe wood matters appeared critical for Bagration, exposed to attacks in\r\nfront and flank at the same time; but at 9 a.m. Baggohufwudt’s corps\r\narrived to his support. Eugen’s division was placed in reserve behind\r\nSemenovskoï; two of Olsuviev’s regiments reinforced Tuchkov IV, while\r\nthe remaining four pushed into the wood and drove the Westphalians out\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe attack on the wood had, however, caused the cessation of the\r\nflanking fire which had annoyed the Poles; and Poniatowski attacked\r\nand carried the knoll behind Utitza. The success was but momentary.\r\nStrogonov rallied his broken division; Tuchkov I himself led forward\r\nthe Pavlovsk Grenadier regiment; while Olsuviev broke out of the wood\r\nwith two regiments of Chasseurs. Attacked in front and flank, and\r\ncharged by Olsuviev in the rear, the Poles were unable to stand and\r\nwere thrust back to Utitza. The Russian success was achieved at the\r\ncost of the life of Tuchkov, who was mortally wounded as he led on his\r\nGrenadiers.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Baggohufwudt enabled Bagration to steady his line\r\nagainst the renewed advance of Davout and Ney. The struggle on the low\r\nheights was indescribably close and desperate. Behind the furiously\r\nfighting masses of infantry hovered the cavalry, charging again and\r\nagain as opportunities presented themselves. By 10 a.m. the French had\r\nonce more taken the redans; and the 15th Léger, of Friant’s division,\r\nfought its way into the ruins of Semenovskoï. Borozdin, charging with\r\nfour regiments of Grenadiers, drove it out again past the redans,\r\nbut was then set upon by Nansouty’s cavalry and forced back; and the\r\nstruggle raged more furiously than ever as the French once more stormed\r\nthe redans, to be hurled out again by a counter-attack of Tuchkov IV’s\r\ndivision, led by Konovnitzin. Already the losses had been fearful.\r\nRomoeuf, Davout’s chief-of-staff, had fallen, and on the Russian side\r\nGeneral Tuchkov IV, the second of his family to die for Russia on the\r\nfield of Borodino.\r\n\r\nEugène, having crossed the Kolotza by the temporary bridges, placed\r\nbatteries in position to bombard the Great Redoubt, and formed Morand’s\r\ndivision opposite that of Paskievich, which held the knoll. Broussier\r\nmoved forward in support on Morand’s left, while Gérard was still\r\ncrossing the stream. Paskievich’s troops outside the redoubt were so\r\nshattered by the fire of the French batteries that they sought refuge\r\nbehind the shoulder of the knoll; and General Bonami, with the 30th\r\nof the Line, saw his chance. As the regiment advanced up the knoll it\r\nsuffered fearfully in its close formation, but nevertheless pressed on\r\ndauntlessly and stormed the work, after a furious struggle with the\r\nRussian infantry and gunners, who proved, as Captain François says,\r\nworthy antagonists.\r\n\r\nThis sudden piercing of the centre of the Russian line produced an\r\nimmediate counter-attack, while Morand’s other regiments appear to have\r\nbeen too busy with Kolubakin’s division to support Bonami. A message\r\nwas hurriedly sent to Barclay; but without waiting for orders all the\r\nofficers on the spot immediately did the right thing. Yermólov, who\r\nwas at hand, picked up a battalion of the Ufa regiment (Likhachev’s\r\ndivision) and was joined by Colonel Löwenstern, Barclay’s aide, with\r\none of the Regiment of Tomsk. Likhachev hurried up the 19th and 40th\r\nChasseurs. Vassilchikov promptly turned a battalion of Kolubakin’s\r\ndivision against the lost redoubt, and Paskievich, rallying his broken\r\ndivision, again pushed forward. The improvised attack was completely\r\nsuccessful. Unsupported, except by one battalion of the 13th Léger,\r\nthe gallant 30th was lost. The redoubt was recaptured and Bonami\r\ndesperately wounded and taken. As the remains of the regiment streamed\r\naway down the knoll, Barclay came upon the scene, and let loose a\r\nbrigade of Kreutz’s Dragoons. The 30th was almost completely destroyed,\r\nonly 11 officers and 257 men being able to rally. The Russians had not\r\ncome off scatheless. Count Kutaïsov was killed as he led the charge\r\nwith Yermólov, and the latter was wounded. To cover the escape of the\r\nremains of the 30th Eugène concentrated a tremendous artillery fire on\r\nthe redoubt, in which Barclay replaced Paskievich’s shaken division by\r\nLikhachev’s.\r\n\r\nThe Great Redoubt was retaken at about 11 a.m., and at the same time\r\nNey, Davout and Murat made a last and determined assault on Bagration’s\r\nposition about Semenovskoï. The last reserves of the 1st and 3rd Corps\r\nwere thrown into the fight; Napoleon sent up the rest of the 8th Corps;\r\nbehind the infantry were ranged Nansouty’s and Latour-Maubourg’s corps\r\nand the Corps Cavalry, and the attack was covered by the fire of over\r\n250 guns.\r\n\r\nThis final assault was made by the French and Germans with magnificent\r\ncourage. Under the furious fire of the Russian artillery and musketry\r\nthe attacking columns pressed steadily on. The sight of their advance\r\nroused Bagration to generous admiration. Believing that it could not\r\nbe stayed by artillery and infantry fire, he determined to make a\r\ncounter-attack, and sent forward every available battalion. Again the\r\nopposing forces closed in deadly strife--Frenchmen, Russians and sturdy\r\nGermans, Spaniards and Portuguese enlisted in a quarrel not their own,\r\nfighting to the death around the blood-stained derelict redans. The\r\ncavalry joined in the conflict, individual regiments and squadrons\r\nstriking in whenever an opportunity occurred. Bagration was desperately\r\nwounded in the leg; and Löwenstern tells how he found him lying among\r\nhis staff behind the line, while Sir James Wylie, Alexander’s surgeon,\r\nattended to his wound. He said to Löwenstern, “How goes it with\r\nBarclay? Tell him that the safety of the army depends upon him. All\r\ngoes well here at present”--and then seeing that Löwenstern was himself\r\nwounded, he kindly added: “Get yourself bandaged.” This touch helps\r\none to understand the personal admiration which Bagration undoubtedly\r\ninspired in nearly everyone who came in contact with him; and it is\r\ncertain that his fall caused a serious slackening in the vigour of the\r\ndefence. Once more the stubborn Russians were driven from the redans\r\nand past Semenovskoï; and this time they were not to regain their lost\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nAfter Bagration’s wound the temporary command devolved upon the brave\r\nsoldier Konovnitzin; but he was unable to check the retreat which\r\nhad now definitely set in. The whole of the defending force gave\r\nback towards Tzarévo, and upon it Murat launched his great masses of\r\ncavalry. Still there appear to have been no signs of demoralisation,\r\nand little real disorder; and, though clearly worsted, the Russian\r\ninfantry maintained a desperate resistance. Behind Semenovskoï the\r\nIsmailovski and Lithuanian Guards, which had not yet been seriously\r\nengaged, were drawn up in squares; and, their heavy fire checked the\r\nadvance of the French cavalry. Murat brought up some batteries which\r\nopened fire against them, while in the intervals of the cannonade\r\nLatour-Maubourg’s corps charged their shattered battalions. The Guards\r\nsuffered fearfully, but closed their ranks and held firm, repelling\r\nthree charges of the Saxon Cuirassiers, who were almost annihilated.\r\nThe two regiments must, however, have been destroyed also but that\r\nBorozdin II came to their rescue with a Cuirassier brigade, checking\r\nthe French horsemen by countercharges and enabling the Guards to follow\r\nin the retreat, leaving their position outlined in squares of dead and\r\ndying.\r\n\r\nIn the rear of Semenovskoï the ground was covered with struggling\r\nhordes of infantry and cavalry. Out of the confusion at length emerged\r\nsome sort of order, the Russians taking up position along the Tzarévo\r\nplateau, covered by the fire of batteries from the reserve, while\r\nDavout and Ney reformed in front of Semenovskoï. Davout had been hit\r\nfour times, but declined to leave the field, though obliged to withdraw\r\nfor a short time, during which Ney and Murat exercised the command.\r\nThe King of Naples behaved with all his usual reckless bravery; and\r\nBaron Lejeune speaks with admiration of the splendid figure presented\r\nby Ney, as he stood directing the battle from the parapet of a redan.\r\nAnd on the other side Barclay, now practically in sole command of the\r\nRussian army, was setting an example no less heroic, apparently wishing\r\nto meet his death on the field of Borodino. As the stress of battle\r\ngrew, the Russian generals for the most part concealed the insignia\r\nwhich made them conspicuous; not so the slandered War-Minister, who\r\nfaced the storm wearing full-dress uniform and all his decorations. It\r\nis impossible not to appreciate the heroic impulse that prompted him,\r\nlike Nelson and many another fiery spirit, to expose himself to death\r\ndecorated with the badges won on the field of honour. His staff were\r\nalmost all killed or wounded, and he had two horses shot under him,\r\nbut escaped with the slightest injury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nMARSHAL NEY\r\n\r\nCommander of the 3rd French Army Corps. The hero of the Retreat\r\n\r\nAfter the picture by Langlois at Versailles]\r\n\r\nAs he saw Bagration’s line driven in, Kutuzov had ordered the 4th\r\nCorps also to draw in to the centre. By noon the Russian position\r\nwas peculiar. Dokhturov on the right and Tuchkov on the left still\r\nfaced the French in nearly their old positions, while the rest of the\r\narmy stretched in a convex between them. To drive back Dokhturov and\r\nTuchkov was Napoleon’s next object, and he was about to order forward\r\npart of his Guard when, apparently a little after noon, he received\r\nintelligence that his left was being attacked.\r\n\r\nEarly in the day Platov, reconnoitring towards the right, had\r\nascertained that there were comparatively few French troops north of\r\nthe Kolotza, and had proposed to the commander-in-chief a cavalry\r\nattack on their flank and rear. Kutuzov assented, and for the\r\npurpose detailed Uvarov’s cavalry corps,[6] some 3500 sabres strong.\r\nClausewitz, who was then on Uvarov’s staff, criticises the movement\r\nseverely. Certainly 3500 regular, and 4000 irregular, horsemen could\r\nnot of themselves effect much; but it is a little difficult to concur\r\nin his opinion that the detachment of Uvarov’s corps was a rash\r\nweakening of the line. It is easier to agree with him when he says\r\nthat the movement was made too early in the day. Uvarov, however, was\r\nvery slow and did not cross the Kolotza until past eleven. About 11.30\r\nhe approached the Voïna (a little stream which enters the Kolotza\r\nat Borodino), at Besubovo, about a mile and a half from the former\r\nvillage. On the Russian side of the stream stood Guyon’s cavalry\r\nbrigade and a regiment of the Italian Guard, which withdrew over a mill\r\ndam before the fire of Uvarov’s artillery to join the rest of the Guard\r\nand Delzons’ division, which occupied Borodino. Platov now came up, and\r\nhis wild horsemen dashed through a ford and among the Italian infantry,\r\nfollowed, without orders, by the Cossacks of the Guard, who lost\r\nheavily in charging the squares. Uvarov, however, would not risk his\r\nregulars, halted, sent for orders and finally withdrew. Clausewitz’s\r\ncomment is that he was not the man to lead such an attack. Löwenstern\r\nfumes at his slowness and hesitation. More, undoubtedly, might have\r\nbeen achieved with a bolder commander. Even so his feeble diversion\r\nbrought Eugène back across the Kolotza with Broussier’s division, and\r\ndelayed the advance against the Great Redoubt. He finally withdrew\r\nabout 3 p.m., but before this Eugène had returned across the Kolotza.\r\n\r\nAll this time a tremendous and unprecedented cannonade was being kept\r\nup. Between Borodino and Utitza some 900 guns were in action. The Great\r\nRedoubt was being furiously bombarded by Eugène’s artillery, while\r\nNey’s batteries brought a converging fire to bear upon it from the\r\nsouthward. To storm it Eugène detailed Gérard’s division, hitherto but\r\nlightly engaged, while Morand and Broussier supported; and Napoleon\r\nordered Montbrun, with his Cuirassier divisions, to charge the Russian\r\nline on Gérard’s right. Montbrun was killed as he led forward his men,\r\nand General Caulaincourt, brother of the Duke of Vicenza, came hastily\r\nfrom the Emperor to take up the command. “Don’t stop to lament!” he\r\nsaid to the dead general’s aides. “Follow and avenge him!” The mass of\r\nmail-clad horsemen broke through the Russian line south of the redoubt,\r\nwheeled to the left and came thundering upon its rear, just as Eugène’s\r\ninfantry reached it in front. For the four regiments of Likhachev’s\r\ndivision which held it there was no escape--at least as regards the\r\nmajor part. Some of them who were outside the work succeeded in saving\r\nthemselves; but those within were trapped and, after maintaining a\r\ndesperate resistance against the charges in front and rear, were almost\r\nall cut to pieces. Likhachev, who was very ill, flung himself among\r\nthe assailants, and had almost found the death which he sought when\r\nsome French soldiers, attracted by his insignia, took him prisoner,\r\nseverely wounded. Caulaincourt was struck down as he led the triumphant\r\ncharge of his Cuirassiers--one more victim of the fatal “Battle of the\r\nGenerals.”\r\n\r\nThe capture of the redoubt opened a huge gap in the Russian line,\r\nthrough which Eugène’s and Grouchy’s cavalry poured to complete the\r\nvictory. Against them Barclay hurled all the horsemen whom he had\r\nunder his hand--the 2nd and 3rd Cavalry Corps and the Cuirassiers\r\nof the Guard--leading more than one charge in person, while\r\nOstermann-Tolstoï’s corps, supported by the yet unengaged portions\r\nof the 5th Corps, was ordered to make a counter-attack towards\r\nSemenovskoï. Ostermann-Tolstoï, as he had shown at Ostrovno, was not\r\nthe man for an emergency; Löwenstern says that he appeared to have\r\nentirely lost his head. He moved forward so slowly that Ney, Davout\r\nand Murat were able to make preparations to receive him. The French\r\ninfantry were almost fought out; the cavalry had literally “foamed\r\nthemselves away” in endeavouring to shatter the resistance of the\r\nstubborn Russian infantry; the fire of the Russian artillery was\r\nas steady and effective as ever. The Marshals sent again and again\r\nfor some part of the Guard to support their weary men, but Napoleon\r\nrefused to risk it. The Russian writers express astonishment at his\r\ncaution. All that he would do was to send forward the reserve of heavy\r\nartillery, under Comte Sorbier. Sorbier swore at Lejeune, who brought\r\nthe order to advance. “I ought to have had it an hour ago!” was his\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\nThe Marshals had got together 80 guns wherewith to oppose the Russian\r\nadvance; and when Sorbier came up the 4th Corps was overwhelmed\r\nwith a crushing cannonade, against which it could not make way. Its\r\nlosses were terrible. General Bakhmetiev had his leg carried away;\r\nOstermann-Tolstoï himself and several of his staff were wounded. The\r\nsupporting cavalry charged with splendid audacity, and some of them\r\nactually re-entered the Semenovskoï redans. All was in vain. Sorbier’s\r\nbattery had turned the scale against the Russians, and by about 4\r\no’clock they were in full retreat. The infantry and cavalry on both\r\nsides were fairly fought out, and the struggle was maintained only\r\nby the artillery, except on the extreme left of the Russian line,\r\nwhere Tuchkov’s force, now commanded by Baggohufwudt, was practically\r\nisolated. The Polish Corps, supported by the Westphalians on the left,\r\nsucceeded about 5 p.m. in carrying the Utitza knoll, and Baggohufwudt,\r\nstill barring the road, drew back into line with the centre and left.\r\nThere was a last flicker of hostility near Semenovskoï, where the\r\nFinnish Guards repulsed an advance of some French battalions, and\r\nthen the battle died away in a dwindling cannonade, until a thick fog\r\nshrouded in a merciful veil the awful scene of slaughter. The Russian\r\nline, reformed by Barclay, stretched from beyond Gorki along the edge\r\nof the Tzarévo plateau to the old Moscow road. Four Chasseur regiments,\r\nunder Colonel Potemkin, were on the right with Platov’s Cossacks. The\r\nremains of Dokhturov’s corps, supported by Uvarov, held Gorki. Next\r\ncame Ostermann-Tolstoï’s corps; and thence Raievski and Borozdin, with\r\nPrince Eugen’s and Shakovski’s (late Tuchkov IV’s) divisions, continued\r\nthe line to Baggohufwudt’s position. The cavalry was in rear, and\r\nthe 5th Corps in reserve behind the centre. The French lay opposite,\r\nDelzons and Lecchi north of the Kolotza and, to the south of the river,\r\nthe 4th, 3rd, 1st, 8th and 5th Corps in succession from Borodino\r\nthrough Semenovskoï to a point about 1200 yards east of Utitza.\r\n\r\nThe consensus of opinion of eyewitnesses on the Russian side is that\r\nthe spirit of the Russians was unbroken, and that there was little\r\nconfusion in the ranks. Löwenstern says that he offered to attack the\r\nGreat Redoubt at break of day, and that Barclay approved. Kutuzov,\r\nhowever, when he learned the extent of the slaughter in his army,\r\ndecided to retreat. It is quite certain that he must have retired in a\r\nday or two, since he had no reserves, while Napoleon had 11,000 fresh\r\ntroops (Laborde and Pino) approaching the field. Barclay, however, was\r\nbitterly angry; and when he received the order to retreat broke into a\r\nfierce invective against Bennigsen, to whose influence he attributed\r\nKutuzov’s resolution.\r\n\r\nUnder cover of darkness the Russian army quietly withdrew, and on\r\nthe 8th took up a position in front of Mozhaïsk. The retreat was\r\neffectually covered by the Cossacks, who displayed great audacity, and\r\nin the night of the 7th-8th repeatedly disturbed the French bivouacs.\r\nThe French cavalry, shattered and exhausted, could do little or\r\nnothing, and the Russians remained all through the 8th at Mozhaïsk,\r\nemploying the time in reorganising, and in evacuating towards Moscow\r\nas many as possible of their wounded. Nevertheless many were left to\r\ninevitable death on the field, and thousands more abandoned at Mozhaïsk\r\nto the mercy of the French, who, themselves in a sorely distressed\r\ncondition, simply cast them out to die of misery in the fields.\r\n\r\nRegarding the major tactics of the battle of Borodino there is little\r\nto say. Napoleon had deliberately chosen to make a frontal attack\r\nupon the Russian army in place of turning it; and in the practical\r\nabsence of his personal supervision the battle almost fought itself.\r\nThe idea of taking advantage of the extension of the Russian right\r\nby overwhelming the left was an excellent one. It was foiled by the\r\ndetermination of Bagration’s resistance, which permitted Baggohufwudt’s\r\ncorps to be moved across to his support. On the part of the Russians\r\nthe occupation in force of the position north of the new road proved\r\na blunder, which the remarkable solidity of the Russian resistance\r\nenabled the generals to repair in time.\r\n\r\nAs regards what is often considered Napoleon’s fatal error in not\r\nthrowing in the Guard it is very doubtful whether it was an error\r\nat all. It must be remembered that Ney’s and Davout’s troops were\r\nalmost, if not quite, fought out, that the Russians were still solid\r\nand undemoralised, and holding a position quite as strong as that from\r\nwhich they had been evicted; and that Kutuzov still had some almost\r\nuntouched reserves. The Guard would have had no easy victory, and\r\nNapoleon was probably right when he refused to expose it to severe and\r\nperhaps fatal losses. He knew that the Russians were neither routed nor\r\nin disorder; and if they stood to fight again nearer Moscow he might\r\nyet have sore need of his Guard. He was 1200 miles from the frontier of\r\nhis dominions, and in case of disaster all must depend upon it.\r\n\r\nOf the minor tactics little need be said. On both sides they were crude\r\nand wasteful. There was a deficiency of infantry on the French side,\r\nand the cavalry was freely employed to supplement it, with the result\r\nthat it was half destroyed. The infantry formations were dense and\r\nclumsy, it was a case of heavy mass pushing against heavy mass, with\r\ncavalry mingled in the melée, and all under the fire of a thousand\r\nor more pieces of artillery. It is no wonder that the losses were\r\nunprecedented on both sides.\r\n\r\nNapoleon gave his loss at 10,000. French writers admit the suspicious\r\nround number of 28,000--6547 killed and 21,453 wounded--but Martinien’s\r\nlists show 49 generals and 1934 officers killed and wounded, and even\r\nallowing for the fact that many of the effectives were now low, and\r\nthe proportion of officers to rank and file therefore higher than\r\nusual, this can scarcely imply less than 43,000 casualties. Even the\r\ntroops which had never been sent forward had suffered somewhat from the\r\ncannonade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF BORODINO (September 7th, 1812)]\r\n\r\nThe losses of the First Russian Army from the 4th to the 7th of\r\nSeptember are stated by Bogdanovich at 9252 killed and 19,226 wounded.\r\nThose of the Second Army may perhaps, since it contained only 54\r\nbattalions and 52 squadrons as against Barclay’s 122 battalions and 112\r\nsquadrons, be estimated at 12,000. Adding the losses of the militia,\r\na total is obtained of possibly 41,000 or 42,000. Sir Robert Wilson\r\nestimates it at 1500 officers and 36,000 men. Buturlin gives 15,000\r\nkilled and 30,000 wounded.\r\n\r\nPrisoners there were few--perhaps 1000 or 1200 French and 2000\r\nRussians. The estimates of guns captured are somewhat vague. Kutuzov’s\r\nofficial figure of French guns taken and carried off by the Russians is\r\n8. There may, of course, have been others disabled. The Russians seem\r\nto have lost about 18 in all.\r\n\r\nOn the field Borodino can scarcely be described as anything but a drawn\r\nbattle. Napoleon had gained a little ground, but the Russian army was\r\nunbroken and apparently quite willing to renew the contest next day.\r\nStrategically the French appeared to have obtained a slight success,\r\nsince they were able to continue their advance to Moscow. On the other\r\nhand, the battle, which ruined the cavalry and seriously shattered the\r\ninfantry, brought ultimate ruin distinctly nearer. Perhaps its most\r\nnoteworthy result was the extent to which the morale of the Napoleonic\r\narmy was broken.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: This is not absolutely certain, but appears to be proved\r\nby the statements of eyewitnesses of the campaign. De Fezensac, for\r\nexample, says that the 3rd Corps had not yet exhausted its supplies\r\nwhen it entered Moscow.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Uvarov had 32 squadrons in all.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE OCCUPATION AND DESTRUCTION OF MOSCOW\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE morning of the 8th of September found the army of Napoleon\r\nbivouacked among the dead and wounded on the field of Borodino. Only\r\nthe Guard was really ready for further combat. The corps of Davout\r\nand Ney were terribly cut up; the 17th, 30th and 106th Regiments were\r\nnearly destroyed. The cavalry, which had to compensate for Napoleon’s\r\ncomparative weakness in infantry, had suffered fearfully. Nearly all\r\nits corps and divisional commanders were killed or wounded; several\r\nregiments were almost annihilated. The four corps of the reserves\r\ncounted some 19,000 men on September 2nd; on the 20th they could muster\r\nlittle more than 10,000. Thousands of horses had been killed, and there\r\nwas no present possibility of being able to replace them, while the\r\nwounded animals were mostly doomed to perish from lack of forage and\r\nproper care. The cavalry of the Guard alone was in a state for serious\r\ncombat.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the wounded was horrible. Means of every kind for tending\r\nthem were lacking, and fortunate were those whose end was hastened by\r\nthe incurable nature of their hurts, or thirst and starvation. Days\r\nelapsed before all had received so much as first aid; and this was but\r\nthe commencement of their miseries. The great monastery of Kolotskoï\r\nbecame the principal hospital, and in its buildings the victims of\r\nBorodino were huddled literally in heaps, without beds even of straw,\r\nwithout food or fire, and without a tenth of the medical aid that was\r\nneeded. Some of the wounded officers were able to buy food, at enormous\r\nprices, from the convoys which passed these dens of horror; but for\r\nthe unhappy rank and file, who possessed little or no money, there\r\nwas no hope. Sanitation there was none, and the unfortunate beings\r\ndied in thousands, amid filth, pestilence and neglect. François says\r\nthat in one hospital a dead officer was found who, in the agonies of\r\nstarvation, _had devoured his own arm to the bone_. It is a painful\r\ntask even to touch upon these sickening details, but to fail to do so\r\nis to neglect the primary duty of an historian.\r\n\r\nBesides the enormous diminution of the effective strength, the state\r\nof the ammunition-trains was by no means reassuring. There is reason\r\nto believe that the artillery had fired 90,000 rounds during the 5th\r\nand 7th; the infantry must have expended millions of cartridges. It\r\nis certain that, immediately after Borodino, Napoleon was anxiously\r\npressing for fresh supplies of ammunition; and it is doubtful if he\r\ncould have delivered another pitched battle before they arrived.\r\n\r\nWorse than all, the spirit of the troops was grievously depressed.\r\nThe gaiety which commonly characterises Frenchmen, even in untoward\r\ncircumstances, had vanished. Gloomy silence reigned during the march\r\nand in the bivouacs. The negative results of the great battle had\r\ncompleted the discouragement of the troops. The French soldiers, at any\r\nrate, were too intelligent not to have some inkling of the disasters\r\nthat might too probably lie before them.\r\n\r\nOn the whole Kutuzov might perhaps have remained longer on the field\r\nof battle. It is, however, probable that his withdrawal to Mozhaïsk\r\nwas wise. He had dealt a tremendous blow at the efficiency and morale\r\nof Napoleon’s army, but in doing so his own forces had been fearfully\r\nshattered. Had he remained in position the circumstance might have\r\ndecided Napoleon to use the almost untouched Guards, and so at the last\r\nmoment wring a victory from frowning Fortune.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun dissipated the autumn fog which had enwrapped the field,\r\nthe Russian position was seen to be guarded only by the hovering\r\n_pulks_ of Platov’s Cossacks. Against them Murat moved such of his\r\nexhausted horsemen as could be rallied; and before the advance of\r\nregular squadrons the riders withdrew. Behind them, however, were\r\nsupports of infantry--the four Chasseur regiments of the 2nd Corps.\r\nThey gave back very slowly, and did not reach Mozhaïsk until 4 p.m.\r\nBy that time a large number of the Russian wounded had already been\r\nevacuated. The town, however, was still choked with disabled men,\r\nmany of whom were in a state to be moved, and to cover this operation\r\nKutuzov directed Platov to hold it as long as possible. The Russian\r\nmain body was in position behind it.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, as soon as he was assured that the Russians had really\r\nretired, ordered Murat to press their retreat. The King had the\r\nfour reserve cavalry corps and the light horse of Ney and Davout as\r\nbefore,--a total now of not more than 14,000 lances and sabres--but\r\nCompan’s shattered division was replaced by that of Dufour (_vice_\r\nFriant wounded). The Emperor apparently at first believed that Kutuzov\r\nwas in full retreat, and the head-quarters baggage was directed on\r\nMozhaïsk; but Murat, as aforesaid, made little or no headway against\r\nPlatov; and the head-quarters could not be transferred. Desultory\r\nskirmishing and cannonading went on until nightfall, when Platov was\r\nstill in possession of Mozhaïsk.\r\n\r\nThe firm front shown by Platov must have convinced Napoleon that the\r\nspirit of the Russians was unbroken. He spent a part of the day in\r\ngoing over the battle-field, examining the positions and reviewing\r\nthe troops according to his custom. In the afternoon he went forward\r\nto join Murat, and on the way received another unpleasant reminder\r\nof the unabated courage of his foes, some foragers being driven in by\r\nCossacks, and an alarm caused. On this day, however, a much needed\r\nreinforcement arrived in the form of Pino’s Italian division.\r\n\r\nAt about 10 a.m. on the 9th Platov was fiercely attacked by Murat,\r\nexpelled, and driven along the Moscow road. Murat’s pursuit was checked\r\nby a reinforcement of twelve battalions and a heavy battery sent\r\nback by Kutuzov, but Mozhaïsk was lost, and Napoleon transferred his\r\nhead-quarters thither. Some thousands of the most seriously injured of\r\nthe Russian wounded were still there; and there were hideous scenes as\r\nthey were cast out of the houses for those of the French army, who, in\r\ncarriages and waggons, or dragging themselves along on foot, streamed\r\nin piteous procession in rear of the leading troops. The Russian main\r\nbody retired deliberately to Semlino (or Shelkovka) about 12 miles east\r\nof Mozhaïsk.\r\n\r\nNapoleon himself remained for three days at Mozhaïsk recovering from\r\nhis cold, and transacting arrears of business. Already on August 27th\r\nhe had sent orders to Victor to bring the 9th Corps from the Niemen up\r\nto Smolensk; and from Mozhaïsk fresh directions were despatched for\r\nhim. From Mozhaïsk also was sent the bulletin announcing the battle of\r\nBorodino. As his cold rendered him speechless Napoleon wrote it with\r\nhis own hand; and, being at best an execrable writer, the result may\r\nbe imagined. The French losses are stated in it at 10,000. This would,\r\naccording to Napoleon’s usual standard, indicate from 40,000 to 50,000\r\ncasualties.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Russian army was still steadily retiring on the high-road\r\nto Moscow, and Murat deliberately following. Eugène, as before, marched\r\non the north by a track running roughly parallel with the main road by\r\nthe towns of Rusa and Zvenigorod, while Poniatowski formed the right\r\nflank guard on the south. Junot remained at Borodino and Kolotskoï\r\nto guard the hospitals. In support of Murat marched Mortier with the\r\ndivisions of Roguet and Claparède; and behind him Davout and Ney in\r\nthe order named.\r\n\r\nKutuzov was displeased with Platov for abandoning Mozhaïsk prematurely,\r\nas he considered, and superseded him in the command of the rear-guard\r\nby Miloradovich. On the 10th the Russian main body made another\r\ndeliberate march of about 8 miles, while Miloradovich stood to fight at\r\nKrymskoië, some 3 miles short of Kutuzov’s evening position. His force\r\nconsisted of six weak regiments of Chasseurs, four line regiments,\r\nUvarov’s nearly intact cavalry division, and some Cossacks. He occupied\r\na low, partly wooded ridge; his left was covered by a marsh, his right\r\nby woods, while in the centre the high-road approached the ridge by\r\na narrow gully which was commanded by the Russian guns. Clausewitz,\r\nhowever, who was present, does not consider that the position was\r\nparticularly advantageous. The twenty defending battalions can hardly\r\nhave mustered over 6000 bayonets. Murat came up towards 5 p.m., and\r\ndeveloped a fierce attack by Dufour’s division upon the right of the\r\nposition, defended by three Chasseur regiments under Colonel Potemkin.\r\nAfter a hard struggle Potemkin was forced back from the summit of\r\nthe ridge, but he held firm, supported by three regiments sent to\r\nhis support by Miloradovich. Uvarov’s horsemen succeeded in keeping\r\nMurat’s broken regiments at bay; and the Russians fought on doggedly\r\nuntil darkness put an end to the contest. The Russian loss is stated,\r\nprobably with some exaggeration, at 2000. As Martinien’s lists show 71\r\nofficers killed and wounded between the 8th and 10th, the French can\r\nscarcely have lost less than 1200.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th the main Russian army marched 16 miles to Viazema (Viazma\r\non modern maps). Miloradovich retired to Kubinskoi, 8 miles from\r\nKrymskoië, unpursued by Murat. Eugène and Poniatowski were nearly\r\nlevel with Murat on the north and south, Mortier and Davout some\r\ndistance behind, and Ney only a short way past Mozhaïsk. On the\r\n12th Kutuzov retrograded to Momonovo, a bare ten miles from Moscow,\r\nwhile Miloradovich withdrew to Malo Viazema, 12 miles to the westward,\r\nleisurely followed by Murat. On the same day Napoleon left Mozhaïsk for\r\nthe front.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nMOSCOW FROM THE SPARROW HILLS\r\n\r\nThis is practically the scene which Napoleon contemplated in 1812]\r\n\r\nThe question of the fate of Moscow was now imminent. It is at least\r\npossible that Kutuzov would have risked another battle had there been\r\na fair prospect of success. But it cannot be said that this was the\r\ncase. All the way from Mozhaïsk the militia had been steadily joining,\r\nbut even so the army mustered less than 90,000 men, and of these only\r\n65,000 were regulars, as against over 90,000 still under Napoleon’s\r\nhand. Many of the militia were as yet unequipped with fire-arms, and\r\nall were raw and without training. Kutuzov could expect no further\r\nreinforcements of regulars for weeks, whereas Napoleon would be joined\r\nwithin ten days by Laborde’s division as well as by some _régiments de\r\nmarche_. The defective state of his ammunition Kutuzov did not know.\r\nThe spirit of the Russian troops was indeed excellent, but against it\r\nwas the greatest military genius of modern times, backed by an army\r\nwearied indeed, and in part much disheartened, but not yet demoralised,\r\nand including 20,000 untouched and undiscouraged veterans.\r\n\r\nOn June 10th Count Feodor Vasilievich Rostopchin, a former favourite\r\nand confidant of the ill-fated Emperor Paul, and a fanatical opponent\r\nof the French alliance, had been appointed Governor-General of Moscow.\r\nWhether he was the right man for his position must be questioned.\r\nIt does not appear that anything was done to organise and arm the\r\ninhabitants or fortify the city. Nevertheless Rostopchin was furious\r\nat the idea of abandoning Moscow. According to Wilson he never forgave\r\nKutuzov for keeping him in ignorance of the critical state of affairs.\r\n\r\nAs a fact he must have known that the evacuation of the city was to be\r\nexpected; and he appears to have been steadily clearing it as far as\r\npossible of its inhabitants. This was the more practicable because in\r\nthe summer Moscow was considerably less populated than in the winter,\r\nthe nobles and their large households of serfs and retainers being\r\nabsent on their estates. Otherwise the Governor, who was not a soldier,\r\nseems to have considered a good many rather wild plans of resistance.\r\nIt would have been perfectly feasible to defend Moscow with the 90,000\r\ntroops of Kutuzov, but its destruction would thereby have been rendered\r\ninevitable. As regards Rostopchin’s project of arming the inhabitants,\r\nit is certain that such muskets as were available were obsolete and of\r\nbad quality. For the rest, 200,000 human beings cannot abandon their\r\nhomes in a day, and since the French found the city nearly deserted it\r\nis obvious that the exodus of the Muscovites had long been in progress.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th the Russians fell back to Fili, and took up a position on\r\nthe east side of Moscow, chosen by Bennigsen, who eulogises it in his\r\nmemoirs, saying that its only defect was that it was rather long. On\r\narriving Barclay proceeded to inspect it, while Kutuzov, who could ill\r\nsupport the fatigue of the campaign, rested. Dokhturov, who apparently\r\nhad a touch of the courtier about him, proceeded to serve him a meal,\r\nbut the little picnic was quickly interrupted by Colonel Löwenstern\r\nasking for Dokhturov, with whom Barclay wished to confer.\r\n\r\n“As usual!” said Barclay as he sent off Löwenstern. “There they all\r\nare, dancing attendance on the Prince, and not troubling about what\r\n_they_ (the French) may do. Fetch Dokhturov here, even if his mouth is\r\nstill full.”\r\n\r\nKutuzov apparently rather enjoyed Dokhturov’s disappointment on being\r\nthus interrupted. “You must not keep General Barclay waiting,” he\r\nremarked. “I shall manage very well by myself,” and therewith proceeded\r\nwith his meal, while poor Dokhturov was obliged to go. Barclay and he\r\nstudied the position and came to the conclusion that it was too weak.\r\n\r\nA council of war was called for four o’clock in the afternoon.\r\nBennigsen, still busy examining the position, kept the other generals\r\nwaiting until six. There were present Kutuzov, Barclay, Bennigsen,\r\nDokhturov, Konovnitzin, Raievski, Uvarov, Ostermann-Tolstoï, Yermólov,\r\nToll, and, later on, Platov. Bennigsen opened the discussion by asking\r\nwhether it was better to give battle or to abandon the capital. Kutuzov\r\ninterrupted him, pointing out that the question was not of Moscow, but\r\nthe salvation of all Russia, and that this clearly depended upon the\r\npreservation of the army.\r\n\r\nBarclay strongly supported Kutuzov, and he was followed by Raievski,\r\nKonovnitzin, and Ostermann-Tolstoï. Barclay appears otherwise to have\r\nhad no great confidence in the ability of the Russian troops, diluted\r\nwith militia, to manoeuvre. When fighting generals such as Raievski and\r\nKonovnitzin ranged themselves with him the question was practically\r\ndecided. According to Bennigsen he was supported by Dokhturov and\r\nPlatov; but his claim to have had the votes of Konovnitzin and Yermólov\r\nis elsewhere contradicted. To his suggestion that battle should be\r\ndelivered Ostermann-Tolstoï replied with a blunt question as to whether\r\nhe was ready to answer for victory. Bennigsen evaded this embarrassing\r\nquery; but Kutuzov, who had perhaps already made up his mind, ended\r\nthe discussion by deciding upon retreat. As to its direction Barclay\r\nappears to have considered that it should be to the eastward on\r\nVladimir and Nizhnii Novgorod; but Toll, thinking more of the question\r\nof supplies, suggested a retirement towards Kaluga. A direct retreat\r\non the latter place would have exposed the army to one of Napoleon’s\r\ndreaded flanking attacks. Strategically Barclay’s suggestion was\r\nsound enough, if perhaps over-cautious. Clausewitz points out that\r\nNapoleon’s offensive power was exhausted, and that he could scarcely\r\nhave pursued.\r\n\r\nKutuzov decided that the line of the retreat should be by Kolomna\r\non Riazan, thus intermediate between that suggested by Barclay and\r\nthat proposed by Toll. By taking it no opening was afforded for a\r\nflank attack; and it would be easy to manoeuvre on either wing should\r\noccasion arise. The commissariat of the army would be assured since it\r\nwould have at its back the fertile “Black Soil” provinces; and it would\r\nfurthermore be in easy communication with the manufactories of arms at\r\nTula and elsewhere. Orders were therefore issued for the retreat of\r\nthe army by the Kolomna road. Bennigsen was extremely discontented,\r\nand showed his displeasure by leaving the council. He attributed it to\r\nBarclay, and their relations, already strained, became more hostile\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that Kutuzov and Barclay were correct in their\r\nresolution to retreat, but it was no light thing to make it. Kutuzov\r\nwas greatly agitated; he passed a sleepless night, and more than once\r\ntears were seen to roll down his cheeks. No Englishman can perhaps\r\nfully understand what it meant to a Russian to leave “White-Walled\r\nMoscow,” the mother of the Russian land, to the mercy of an enemy.\r\n\r\nBarclay, though now in bad health, took executive command of the\r\nevacuation. At 2 a.m. on the 14th the army began its passage through\r\nthe city. The troops, in the deepest dejection, tramped through the\r\nstreets with furled standards and silent bands, many of them, officers\r\nand men, sobbing with rage and despair. The foreign commandant of the\r\nKremlin garrison regiment began the evacuation with band playing,\r\naccording to the usages of war, and there was a violent outcry\r\namong the retreating soldiery. They indignantly shouted that he was\r\nrejoicing, and the music had to cease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON’S FIRST VIEW OF MOSCOW\r\n\r\nThe Emperor is standing on the Sparrow Hills, from which an imposing\r\nview of the old Russian capital is obtained.\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by Verestchagin.]\r\n\r\nBarclay stationed his staff-officers along the line of retreat to\r\nenforce order. Knowing the especial weakness of the Russian soldiers,\r\nhe issued strict orders that anyone found in a beer-shop or intoxicated\r\nwas to be summarily punished. He worked himself to death in directing\r\nthe march, and was on horseback for eighteen hours. He complained\r\nbitterly of the inefficiency of the staff, which, as usual, did little\r\nor nothing to facilitate the march. There was frequently disorder\r\namong the retiring columns. None the less it must be said that the\r\noperation was remarkably successful. By 9 o’clock in the evening, after\r\neighteen hours of incessant toil, 90,000 fighting men, more than 600\r\nguns and thousands of vehicles, had been passed through the great city\r\nand were on the Kolomna road. Kutuzov himself traversed Moscow in the\r\nmorning. An eyewitness states that he saw him near the Kolomna gate\r\nsitting in his carriage quite alone, resting his head on his hands,\r\nsilent and sad, while before him troops, guns, and waggons poured in\r\nan endless stream. The head of the army halted for the night at Panki,\r\na village about ten miles from the city, where Kutuzov established his\r\nhead-quarters.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, early on the 13th, Napoleon halted his army, fearing that\r\nKutuzov was manoeuvring to attack his right flank. That he could\r\nconceive such an eventuality shows how completely, and not for the\r\nfirst time in the campaign, his cavalry had failed to keep touch with\r\nthe enemy. At 10 a.m., however, he became convinced that the Russian\r\narmy was still in his front, and resumed his march. At 1 p.m. on the\r\n14th Murat’s vanguard crowned the Sparrow Hills, about a mile and a\r\nhalf west of Moscow, and saw before them in the plain the Russian\r\nrear-guard, and beyond it the widespreading city--the goal which they\r\nhad toiled so strenuously to attain.\r\n\r\nThe Russian army was still pouring through the streets, and\r\nMiloradovich sent an officer to Murat to propose a short armistice,\r\nadding that if it were not granted he should defend the city step by\r\nstep, and fire it as he fell back. After a while a sort of informal\r\nsuspension of arms until 7 p.m. was made between Miloradovich and\r\nSebastiani, now commanding the 2nd Cavalry Corps. The Russians\r\nevacuated the Dorogomilov suburb at 3 p.m., and Murat quietly followed.\r\nAt about the same time Napoleon reached the Sparrow Hills. He is said\r\nto have gazed long and eagerly upon the goal of his wishes, now spread\r\nout before his greedy eyes; but he may well have muttered the words\r\nattributed to him: “It is full time!”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor approved of the informal truce concluded by Murat. The\r\npeaceful occupation of Moscow was an end bought cheaply enough at the\r\nprice of the quiet withdrawal of the Russian rear-guard. Mortier was to\r\nbe Governor, General Durosnel Military Commandant, and M. Lesseps, who\r\nhad formerly been French Consul-General at St. Petersburg, Intendant\r\nof the province of Moscow. Orders were issued to prevent the ingress\r\nof plunderers. Eugène and Poniatowski were ordered to halt some miles\r\nshort of the city. Mortier was directed to occupy the Kremlin, and to\r\nmaintain order by severe methods. As the day wore on the 1st and 3rd\r\nCorps and the old Guard closed up on Murat. It is a characteristically\r\nFrench touch that the men had decked themselves out in their parade\r\nuniforms to take part in the triumphal entry.\r\n\r\nAs Miloradovich evacuated quarter after quarter of the city Murat\r\nadvanced, dreading surprise, and taking great precautions against it.\r\nThe streets were deserted; silence reigned everywhere. Near the Kremlin\r\na tumultuous gathering of citizens and stragglers opened a scattering\r\nfire. They were dispersed by cannon shots, and Murat moved on, only\r\nto find silence and apparent desertion. Miloradovich marched through\r\nthe city and established himself for the night some 4 miles from the\r\nKolomna gate. Winzingerode’s detachment, which had been falling back\r\nbefore Eugène, was on the St. Petersburg road, and another cavalry\r\ndetachment was escorting the public treasure and the archives of Moscow\r\nto Vladimir.\r\n\r\nWhen at last it became evident that Moscow was indeed deserted by\r\nmost of its native inhabitants, a deputation of foreign residents was\r\ncollected to be presented to Napoleon. His mortification was extreme.\r\nHe quartered himself in the Dorogomilov suburb, and, between his\r\nanxiety and the dirt and vermin of an ill-kept abode, spent a restless\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nMortier had duly occupied the Kremlin with Roguet’s division, sending\r\nClaparède to support Murat. The silence of the city impressed even the\r\nreckless soldiery of Napoleon. Sergeant Bourgogne naïvely expresses\r\nit by remarking how disappointed they were to see not even a pretty\r\ngirl listening to the regimental bands. With darkness disorder broke\r\nforth everywhere. It was impossible to prevent ill-fed and ill-clad\r\nmen from pillaging when all that they needed, not to speak of wealth,\r\nwhich appeared to their ignorance inconceivable, lay ready to hand.\r\nIn the evening fires were already breaking out. In the morning of the\r\n15th Napoleon, escorted by the Old Guard, took up his residence in the\r\nImperial Palace in the Kremlin.\r\n\r\nIt should here be said that the _Kreml_, or citadel, commonly known in\r\nWestern Europe as the “Kremlin,” was the original fortress or walled\r\ntown of Moskva, fortified in 1147 by Prince Yurí Dolgorúki (Long-handed\r\nGeorge), the son of the famous Great Prince Vladimir Monomakh. Around\r\nit grew up in the course of ages various suburbs, and these were in\r\ntheir turn walled. As the streets were wide, and there were many very\r\nlarge buildings--palaces, monasteries, and the like--often standing in\r\nspacious gardens or enclosures, the city covered an enormous area. It\r\nhad the characteristics in general of a vast country suburb rather than\r\nof a city.\r\n\r\nA volume might be written concerning the burning of Moscow. The\r\ncatastrophe has been described in the works of numerous eyewitnesses,\r\nand lengthy reference to the event itself hardly falls within the\r\ncompass of this work. Three points must, however, be dealt with: the\r\ncauses of the conflagration; its extent; and its effects upon the\r\nfortunes of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nAs regards the origin of the fire it may be regarded as certain that\r\nit was not the outcome of Russian patriotic frenzy. The whole evidence\r\nis to the contrary; and the fury and grief of the Russians at the\r\ndestruction of their holy city were obviously genuine. It was equally\r\nnot due to the deliberate action of the invaders, who had every\r\nmotive for preserving the city for their own convenience. It remains\r\nto be considered whether it was the act of Rostopchin or due to mere\r\naccident, assisted by a fortuitous combination of circumstances.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion at the time attributed the conflagration to Rostopchin.\r\nTwo of his own residences were destroyed, and a few weeks later\r\nhe deliberately fired his country mansion at Voronovo in order to\r\nprevent its seizure by the French. Sir Robert Wilson, who had means\r\nof knowing, says that Rostopchin’s design was notorious, and that in\r\norder to prevent him from carrying it into execution Kutuzov repeatedly\r\nannounced his intention of delivering battle before Moscow. Buturlin,\r\nthe contemporary Russian historian, also attributes the fire to the\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\nRostopchin’s own testimony cannot unfortunately be trusted. He, at the\r\ntime, admitted the responsibility of having burned Moscow. Nevertheless\r\nlater, as a voluntary exile abroad, he repudiated it. All that can\r\nbe said is that either he was really responsible, or that if not he\r\nclaimed the credit in the belief that the burning of Moscow would be\r\nregarded as an heroic action, and only disowned complicity when he\r\nfound that it was generally considered atrocious.\r\n\r\nThe French believed that the fire was caused by Rostopchin’s\r\nincendiaries, and hundreds or thousands of the Muscovites remaining in\r\nthe city were hanged, bayoneted, or shot as such. The French, however,\r\nas all their history goes to show, have an unhappy tendency to lose\r\ntheir heads at a crisis, and it is certain that during the burning of\r\nMoscow they were wellnigh insane with panic. For the rest, they were\r\nutterly ignorant of their victims’ language.\r\n\r\nCertain facts appear to emerge from the confusion as proved:--\r\n\r\n (1) The city was by no means entirely deserted by the more respectable\r\n classes. Tutulmin, the director of the foundling hospital, remained\r\n at his post; and a certain number of merchants and gentlemen, some\r\n of Francophil leanings, did not leave. The foreign colony--chiefly\r\n French--also remained.\r\n\r\n (2) The lowest of the lower classes naturally remained; and the\r\n disreputable elements probably preferred to take their chance of\r\n making their profit out of the invaders. The criminals in the prisons\r\n had also been released.\r\n\r\n (3) Whatever may have been the case as regards the mass of ordinary\r\n private dwellings, the palaces and mansions, of which Moscow was full,\r\n as well as most of the many warehouses and shops, were abandoned, as a\r\n seaman might say, “all standing.”\r\n\r\n (4) The fire was beginning as the Russian rear-guard left the city.\r\n\r\n (5) Plundering on the part of the invaders commenced almost\r\n immediately after their entry.\r\n\r\n (6) The wind changed its direction more than once.\r\n\r\n (7) The French captured and utilised a vast quantity of gunpowder.\r\n\r\n (8) Several thousand Russian wounded were left in the city.\r\n\r\nThe obvious deduction from (1) and (3) is that Moscow was hurriedly\r\nevacuated, and this is further supported by the evidence of (7) and\r\n(8). Had there been any settled plan of destruction one does not see\r\nwhy the powder-magazines were not fired, and the buildings of most\r\nimportance to the invaders ruined. Nothing of this description was\r\nattempted, and the ammunition was for the most part saved by the\r\nFrench, to their great advantage. For the rest, with a mob of soldiery,\r\ntogether with a mixed horde of camp-followers of all nations, beggars,\r\ncriminals, and prostitutes, plundering indiscriminately, there was\r\nevery opportunity for wanton destruction. The frequent changes of the\r\nwind helped to spread the conflagration, and it was further assisted by\r\nthe fact that the great majority of the private dwellings were wooden\r\nconstructions.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, regarding the question solely from the standpoint of the\r\nestablished facts, it seems at least possible that the conflagration\r\nof Moscow, like most events of the kind recorded in history, was\r\naccidental in its origin.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that four-fifths of Moscow vanished in the\r\nconflagration, but it is doubtful if the material injury inflicted\r\nupon the invaders was very serious. In the city itself some 500\r\nsecular buildings of stone and brick survived, besides many churches\r\nand convents. The Kremlin was little injured. It is also clear that\r\nthere were available great stores of food and other supplies. Forage\r\nalone was lacking. De Fezensac, who now commanded the 4th Regiment of\r\nNey’s corps, which was generally encamped outside the city, speaks of\r\ntrouble in obtaining supplies, and of poor and coarse fare, but not of\r\nactual want. In Moscow itself there appears to have been a superfluity\r\nof food, though flour was less abundant than other less necessary\r\nsupplies. Clothing and materials for manufacturing it were seized in\r\nquantities, and no doubt the whole army could have been refitted had\r\norganised attempts been made to that end.\r\n\r\nIt was the possession of Moscow which exercised a disastrous influence\r\nupon the fortunes of Napoleon. Having failed to crush the Russian\r\nfield-army, and thereby force Alexander to make peace, he had now\r\nbecome obsessed with the idea that the occupation of Moscow would bring\r\nabout the desired consummation of his hopes. There was, indeed, hardly\r\never the slightest chance of their fulfilment, but Napoleon could not\r\nbring himself to admit this, and lingered among the ruins for week\r\nafter week.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that fires were already commencing as the Russians\r\nevacuated the city; but the first serious outbreak appears to have\r\noccurred at a Government spirit store. It was extinguished, but\r\nsoon afterwards the great bazaar in which, as at Constantinople\r\nand other Oriental cities, the bulk of the retail trade of Moscow\r\nwas concentrated, was found to be on fire. Both spirit stores and\r\nshops would be natural marks for plunderers. The wind rose, drifted\r\ninflammable wreckage across the city, and scattered it among the\r\nwood-built suburbs, through which the conflagration spread with\r\nterrifying rapidity. The stories that the fire engines had disappeared,\r\nand that the ropes of the wells had been cut, may be taken for what\r\nthey are worth. It is obvious that little organised endeavour to\r\ncontrol the conflagration of a vast and largely wood-built city was, or\r\ncould be, made. The Guards in the central quarters soon abandoned all\r\nefforts to fight the flames in order to devote themselves to plunder,\r\nand the officers of the corps encamped outside, convinced that it was\r\nvitally necessary to fill their nearly empty store-waggons, permitted,\r\nor connived at, the entry of their own men to take part in the sack.\r\n\r\nNapoleon himself remained in the Kremlin until the 16th, when a change\r\nin the wind brought the conflagration from the suburbs to the inner\r\nquarters of the city, and rendered residence in the Imperial Palace\r\ndangerous, more especially since the larger part of the captured\r\npowder-magazines were within the citadel. The Emperor left by the\r\nriver gate--the land fronts of the walled enclosure being practically\r\nencircled by the flames--and proceeded along the quays, eventually\r\nreaching the Imperial palace of Petrovski, some 2 miles on the\r\nPetersburg road.\r\n\r\nWith Napoleon’s departure pillage became universal. Some officers\r\nendeavoured to induce their men to take food and clothing, but\r\napparently with little success, and that vast quantities of food were\r\nsaved was due to the fact that the half-famished troops naturally\r\nturned to it. Murder and outrage went hand in hand with pillage. Many\r\ninhabitants were massacred by the soldiery, maddened with licence and\r\nintoxicating liquor; many others perished in the flames of their homes,\r\nor in attempting to escape from them. The miscellaneous horde of female\r\ncamp-followers behaved as badly as the men. Paymaster Duverger relates\r\nhow he knocked down a ruffianly _cantinière_ who was robbing a sick\r\nand helpless Russian lady. There is unhappily evidence that many of\r\nthe officers set a disgraceful example. Some pillaged openly; others\r\nmade a levy upon the plunder of their men. The Guards had the best\r\nopportunities and gained an unenviable pre-eminence in misconduct.\r\nDrunkenness was everywhere rife. The men of the 1st Corps were almost\r\nas bad as the Guards, and probably this carnival of licence was the\r\nevent which contributed most to the destruction of their discipline\r\nearly in the retreat. It is worthy of note that Ney’s corps, which took\r\nlittle direct share in the sack, was the one which kept the best order\r\namid the horrors of the retreat. Marshal Lefebvre was furious at the\r\ndisorder in the Old Guard, and issued a severe order on the subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON WATCHING THE BURNING OF MOSCOW\r\n\r\nFrom the picture by Verestchagin]\r\n\r\nOn the 19th the conflagration began to die away, partly owing to the\r\nequinoctial rains, and on the 20th Napoleon returned to the Kremlin.\r\nUseless efforts were made to induce the inhabitants to return to the\r\nruined city, and the peasants to bring their produce to market.\r\nFor payment Napoleon had provided a supply of forged Russian paper\r\nrúbles; but opportunities for uttering them were not forthcoming,\r\nthough some were distributed to the surviving inhabitants and to\r\ncharitable institutions. A few merchants and tradesmen accepted office\r\nunder the French, but after the destruction of Moscow the Russians who\r\nentertained any feeling towards the invaders but that of bitter hatred\r\nwere few indeed.\r\n\r\nOn evacuating Moscow the Russian army made two leisurely marches on\r\nthe Kolomna road to where it crossed the Moskva, about 20 miles from\r\nthe capital. Kutuzov appears at first to have intended to continue\r\nhis march to Kolomna; but a conference with the Intendant-General\r\nLanskoï convinced him that there would be difficulty in diverting the\r\nline of supply, and he decided to manoeuvre towards Kaluga. On the\r\n17th, therefore, leaving Raievski’s corps to cover the rear, he turned\r\nwestward, and marched along the Pakhra, a rivulet which here joins\r\nthe Moskva, until he reached the Moscow-Kaluga road. On the 21st he\r\ntook up a position behind the Pakhra, with an advance-guard, composed\r\nof the 8th Corps and the 1st Cavalry Division, under Miloradovich at\r\nDesna, only some 10 miles from Moscow. At the same time Dorokhov,\r\nwith the hussars of Yelisabetgrad, the Dragoons of the Guard, and\r\nthree regiments of Cossacks, was detached towards Mozhaïsk. This last\r\nmovement was perhaps premature, since it gave Napoleon early warning of\r\nan intention to operate against his communications.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 15th the glare of a vast conflagration had\r\nreddened the sky to the north-west. All through the next four days\r\nthe bivouacs of the Russians were illuminated by the flames of their\r\nburning “Mother City,” while by day dense banks of smoke lay upon the\r\nhorizon, and charred fragments were frequently borne by the fierce\r\ngales among their marching files. The effect upon the soldiers may\r\nperhaps better be imagined than described. Whether the destruction of\r\nMoscow were deliberate or accidental in its origin, it kindled in the\r\nRussian army a flame of vengeful desire that endured until it marched\r\ntriumphantly into Paris in 1814.\r\n\r\nMurat, with his advanced guard, strengthened by Claparède’s division,\r\nand supported by Poniatowski, was following the Russians. At the\r\nPakhra he lost touch, and not until the 23rd was the true direction of\r\nKutuzov’s march ascertained and followed up, Raievski retiring on the\r\nmain army. Napoleon apparently did not believe that Kutuzov’s whole\r\nforce was to the south of Moscow--at all events he adopted a dangerous\r\nhalf-measure, which might have resulted in disaster. Murat was to press\r\nthe Russians’ right, while a column under Bessières marched from Moscow\r\nagainst their front. Bessières’ force comprised the infantry division\r\nof Friederichs (_vice_ Desaix), now increased by the 33rd Léger, a\r\nbrigade of light cavalry, Colbert’s Lancers, and the 3rd Cavalry Corps\r\ndetached from Murat. Its strength cannot have exceeded 11,000 men,\r\nwhile Murat certainly had not more than 25,000. Barclay and Bennigsen\r\nurged an attack, and it is clear that Murat must have been destroyed,\r\nor forced to retreat in haste. The cautious Kutuzov, however, inferred\r\nthat Bessières was merely Napoleon’s advance-guard--as a fact the\r\nEmperor did on the 28th issue orders for a general advance on the\r\nPakhra. As Kutuzov envisaged the situation, he would have the whole\r\n_Grande Armée_, enormously superior in regular troops, upon his own\r\nweakened forces. The superior condition of his cavalry and artillery\r\ncould scarcely be relied upon to give him more than a doubtful success.\r\nOn the other hand, every day would bring the winter nearer and ensure\r\nthe steady increase of the Russian numbers. He accordingly decided\r\nto retire towards Kaluga. The 4th Corps was detailed to strengthen\r\nRaievski, and Miloradovich took command of the rear-guard. On the\r\n27th there was a brisk encounter of cavalry on the Pakhra. On the 29th\r\nanother engagement took place at Czerikovo. Poniatowski’s infantry were\r\nchecked; General Ferrier was wounded and taken, and the advantage was,\r\non the whole, with Miloradovich, who retired very slowly, contesting\r\nevery mile of country.\r\n\r\nOn October 2nd the main Russian army reached Tarutino on the Nara,\r\nsome 50 miles from Moscow, and took up a position, to protect which\r\nentrenchments were immediately commenced. Next day Sebastiani, always\r\nunlucky, experienced a slight check near Voronovo, but when Murat’s\r\nmain column began to arrive Miloradovich retreated to Spas Kuplia, 10\r\nmiles north of Tarutino. The 4th and 7th Corps were drawn back towards\r\nthe main army, covered by the 8th and most of the cavalry. Early on\r\nthe 4th Murat and Poniatowski surprised the Russians. Spas Kuplia was\r\ncarried and the 8th Corps driven back behind the Chernishnia rivulet,\r\nhalf-way to Tarutino. Konovnitzin, with whom was Sir Robert Wilson, was\r\nnearly captured, but he rode out of the danger-zone, his night-cap,\r\nin which he had been surprised, showing under his cocked hat, puffing\r\ncoolly at his pipe all the time. So Löwenstern describes the scene. The\r\n8th Corps rallied and held firm upon the Chernishnia until night, and\r\neventually retired across the Nara to Tarutino. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th\r\nCavalry Divisions (the first two now amalgamated) and some Cossacks\r\nremained in observation of the French north of the Nara. Murat’s\r\noffensive power had exhausted itself, and he halted, disposing the bulk\r\nof his force along the Chernishnia, with his advance troops at the\r\nvillage of Vinkovo.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the presence of Dorokhov south-east of Moscow had caused\r\nNapoleon to send some twenty miles on the road to Mozhaïsk, Broussier’s\r\ninfantry division, the light cavalry of the 4th Corps, and the Dragoons\r\nand Chasseurs of the Guard. This for the moment relieved the road to\r\nMozhaïsk, but the whole route to Smolensk was infested by Cossacks;\r\nand Napoleon was obliged to issue an order that no body of troops less\r\nthan 1500 strong was to be risked along it. Kutuzov’s withdrawal to\r\nTarutino seems for a short time to have improved matters near Moscow.\r\nMurat, with the reserve cavalry, the bulk of the light horse of the\r\n1st and 3rd Corps, the 5th Corps, Dufour’s and Claparède’s divisions,\r\nremained on the Chernishnia. Broussier was stationed about 9 miles\r\nwest of Moscow; Friederichs on the Pakhra; the Guard Cavalry returned\r\nto Moscow. Foraging detachments were despatched over the surrounding\r\ncountry to gather in food and fodder--with poor results--and in this\r\nmanner a fortnight passed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH SOJOURN IN MOSCOW\r\n\r\n\r\nFor almost a month after Napoleon’s return to Moscow on September 20th,\r\nthe main French army lay almost inactive about the city. The Emperor’s\r\nanxieties on the score of supplies had been to some extent relieved\r\nby the quantities of food and ammunition captured. He says himself in\r\na letter to Lariboissière, the Chief of Artillery, that he has taken\r\n300,000 pounds of powder, and an equal amount of sulphur and saltpetre,\r\nbesides an immense number of cannon-balls and 2,000,000 cartridges.\r\nIt can scarcely be imagined that, however much the habit of lying had\r\nbecome ingrained in him, he would wilfully mislead the man whom, most\r\nof all, it was necessary to furnish with correct information.\r\n\r\nA number of cannon were captured, but all practically useless. The\r\nKremlin, in fact, was and is a museum of ancient weapons, mostly\r\npreserved as trophies of Russia’s victories over her enemies. Among\r\nthem now are hundreds of the guns of the Napoleonic _Grande Armée_\r\nof 1812. The cannon had no carriages, but about twenty of them were\r\nmounted by the French artillerymen on the walls of the ancient citadel.\r\nThe captures of ammunition were of extreme value. Napoleon exultantly\r\ndeclared that he could fight four battles of the magnitude of Borodino.\r\n\r\nForage, however, was seriously deficient. The cavalry and artillery\r\nof the Guard, which received supplies in advance of the other corps,\r\nremained in fair condition, but that of the rest of the army rapidly\r\ndeteriorated. The horses died in great numbers. At the beginning\r\nof October De Chambray estimates that already 4000 troopers were\r\ndismounted. The misery in the advance-guard was great; breadstuffs\r\ncould hardly be obtained, and the men lived chiefly upon horse-flesh.\r\n\r\nIn Moscow matters were by no means satisfactory. The troops had indeed\r\nshelter and food; but these advantages were dearly bought at the\r\nprice of a fatal relaxation in discipline. The privileged Guards were\r\nbad offenders, and Napoleon himself had at last to complain of their\r\nmisconduct. The 1st Corps was little better. The 3rd and 4th Corps\r\nwere mostly outside the city. They lived chiefly from hand to mouth as\r\nbefore, and though a considerable amount of flour had been warehoused\r\nat Moscow Napoleon would not permit it to be issued, even when Berthier\r\nreported Pino’s division as being completely destitute. No issue was\r\nmade of clothing material until October 17th, nor were any preparations\r\nmade for rough-shoeing the horses. In the general relaxation of\r\ndiscipline little was done by the men themselves. In the face of\r\nproven facts such as these the statements as to Napoleon’s unerring\r\nand all-pervading foresight and activity, made even by respectable\r\nwitnesses such as Rapp and Fain, make somewhat foolish reading.\r\n\r\nIn a sense, indeed, Napoleon did provide for much--that is, he issued\r\norders which had they been at all applicable to the situation might\r\nhave effected a great deal. Such an order was that for the provision of\r\nhand-mills for the troops. The need for them had been apparent during\r\nthe advance, and had they been provided earlier they would doubtless\r\nhave been invaluable. As it was the first convoy of them only came to\r\nhand during the retreat, when they were useless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nTHE KREMLIN, MOSCOW\r\n\r\nOn the extreme left is the Great Red Staircase--the State entrance to\r\nthe Palace. Next is the Uspanski Sabor, or Cathedral of the Assumption,\r\nin which the Tzars are crowned. Behind it appears the Bell Tower of\r\nIvan Velikii]\r\n\r\nOthers of the Imperial orders were simply incapable of execution. One\r\nof them, for example, gives directions for exploring the country for\r\ntwo or three leagues on each side of the highway so as to find\r\nparallel roads passing by villages and cultivated tracts. It would have\r\nbeen extremely difficult to find such roads in fertile and well-peopled\r\nGermany, and to expect to discover them in Russia was merely absurd. As\r\na fact, had they existed, the country was laid waste for a breadth of\r\nforty or fifty miles by the destructive passage of two great armies.\r\nThe only criticisms that can be made in reading this order is that\r\nNapoleon’s intellect was either failing or so affected by pride and\r\nover-confidence as to be fatally debilitated.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of his fatal optimism Napoleon was growing uneasy.\r\nOn his return to Moscow he induced Tutulmin, the director of the\r\nFoundling Hospital, to be the bearer of a letter to Alexander. It\r\nwas a diplomatic document after Napoleon’s fashion, compounded of\r\nblandishments and threats; a characteristic touch is the careful\r\ndetailing of the war material which has been captured. The Tzar would\r\nnot deign to reply. Napoleon waited for a fortnight and then sent\r\nGeneral Lauriston to endeavour to open negotiations with Kutuzov.\r\n\r\nHowever, gloomy as the prospect might appear to intelligent observers,\r\nthe bulk of the army was at rest, and, save in the vital matter of\r\nhorses, increasing in strength. During the latter half of September\r\nthere entered Moscow Laborde’s division, the 1st battalion of\r\nHesse-Darmstadt Guards, three battalions of the 33rd Léger, and\r\nseveral _régiments de marche_--in all some 10,000 infantry and over\r\n4000 cavalry. In the first half of October there arrived nearly 17,000\r\nmen--_régiments de marche_, mostly infantry, and the battalions\r\nwhich had been left in garrison at Orsha, Dorogobuzh, Viasma, and\r\nelsewhere. The muster rolls were also swelled by a certain number of\r\nconvalescents. The fighting strength of the 5th and 8th Corps, which\r\nwere harassed by constant skirmishing, remained stationary or declined;\r\nand the number of mounted horsemen steadily dwindled. But in the\r\n1st and 3rd Corps there was a steady increase in the numbers of the\r\ninfantry and artillery. Reinforcements of artillery also arrived; there\r\nwere, indeed, more guns in Moscow than the enfeebled teams could draw.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the French main army during this period of comparative\r\nquiescence were not very important. Eugène early in October pushed\r\nan advance-guard to Dmitrov, some miles north of Moscow, while Ney\r\nmoved to Boghorodsk, about 25 miles eastward on the road to Vladimir.\r\nThe Russian cavalry screen, under Winzingerode, gave back before the\r\nadvance of the French columns, and there was little fighting. Ney\r\nordered the construction of barracks for winter quarters at Boghorodsk,\r\nbut De Fezensac pessimistically remarks that the sham deceived nobody.\r\nNey and Eugène were soon recalled to Moscow, and the entire army,\r\nexcept Murat’s advance-guard, was concentrated there on the 15th.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Murat, isolated on the Chernishnia at a distance of nearly 50\r\nmiles from the main army, and with a vastly superior army in his front,\r\nwas in a position of great danger. The peril was aggravated by the\r\nscantiness of supplies and by the lack of forage, which was steadily\r\nkilling the over-worked horses. Skirmishing was continually taking\r\nplace, with general ill fortune to the invaders. Foraging parties had\r\nto be pushed farther and farther afield, and needed larger and larger\r\nescorts to protect them against the enterprising regular and irregular\r\ncavalry of the Russians. On one occasion a foraging party of Dragoons\r\nof the Guard, under Major Marthod, accompanied by a detachment of the\r\n33rd Léger, was attacked and cut up. On October 9th Colonel Kudachev\r\nwith two regiments of Cossacks made a successful attack upon a large\r\nforaging party, and carried off 200 prisoners. Similar skirmishes\r\nwere continually occurring. On October 10th Dorokhov, who had been\r\nreinforced by five battalions and some more cavalry and artillery,\r\nstormed Vereia, killing or capturing its garrison of 500 Westphalians,\r\nand thus establishing himself dangerously near the Moscow-Smolensk road.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that on October 4th Kutuzov had begun to entrench\r\nhimself at Tarutino. Bennigsen criticises the position severely. The\r\nNara in its front was everywhere fordable, and on the left there were\r\nsome unoccupied heights which might be seized by an assailant. However,\r\nas matters went, there was little fear of an immediate attack, and the\r\nRussians were so strong in cavalry that they could obtain early warning\r\nof any move of the French from Moscow.\r\n\r\nSoon after reaching Tarutino Barclay left the army. He had been deeply\r\nwounded by the rancorous attacks made upon him by the ultra Russians,\r\nand his relations with Bennigsen were very strained. Kutuzov had\r\ntreated him with great respect, and after Borodino had given him the\r\nchief command of both Russian armies. But when a supreme commander\r\nis present at the head-quarters of an army difficulties are certain\r\nto arise. In 1864 the presence of General Grant with Meade’s army of\r\nthe Potomac did not make for unity of command, though both officers\r\nwere men of the finest character. Barclay soon found his position\r\nintolerable, and resigned. He was bitterly hurt, and told Clausewitz,\r\nwho had just been appointed to a post on Wittgenstein’s staff, that he\r\nmight thank heaven that he was well out of it. It is impossible not to\r\nsympathise with him, and at the same time not difficult to see that his\r\ndeparture made for unity of command. Whether Kutuzov was the right man\r\nfor the post of commander-in-chief is another question. Barclay was\r\nabominably ill-treated and insulted by the populace on his way to St.\r\nPetersburg, but Alexander never lost confidence in him, and he emerged\r\nfrom his retirement in 1813 to take command of the Russian armies in\r\nGermany. His departure occasioned a show at least of regret among the\r\nofficers of the army, many of whom perhaps felt conscience-stricken\r\nat the memory of ill-conditioned murmuring and mutiny. Most of the\r\ngenerals came to bid him farewell; and Yermólov, who had been his worst\r\nand most treacherous enemy, actually wept--an episode to which allusion\r\nhas elsewhere been made.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of September, at a mansion on the road to Vladimir,\r\nBagration died. It is probable that travelling on the bad Russian roads\r\nhad brought on gangrene. On his death-bed he was visited by Wilson, who\r\nwas returning from his visit to Alexander. The Tzar, very wisely, had\r\njudged it best to overlook the insubordination of the generals, and\r\nhad sent by Wilson the strongest assurances of his determination to\r\ncontinue the resistance. He would, he said, sooner let his beard grow\r\nto the waist and eat potatoes in Siberia, than permit any negotiations\r\nso long as an armed Frenchman remained in Russia. The language may\r\nperhaps be thought a little high-flown, but it possesses dignity in\r\nthat it was the expression of the firm resolution of the united Russian\r\nnation. To the dying soldier Wilson repeated the brave words of the\r\nTzar. Bagration pressed his hand convulsively. “Dear general,” he said,\r\n“you have made me die happy, for now Russia will assuredly not be\r\ndishonoured. _Accipio solatium mortis._” So passes from the scene the\r\nfine Georgian soldier whose life had been spent in faithful service to\r\nhis adopted country. Wilson eulogises his good qualities, the kindness\r\nand graciousness which his fiery temper perhaps at times concealed,\r\nhis generosity and chivalrous courage. Wilson was his devoted\r\nadmirer--the two had much in common. But in sober fact Bagration,\r\nwhatever his faults, had ever proved himself a worthy descendant of\r\nthe warrior-kings of the Bagratid line; and having adopted Russia, the\r\nsteady protector of the Caucasian Christians, as his country, he had\r\nserved her faithfully to the end. It is difficult not to feel a sense\r\nof decline in passing from Barclay, the simple, devoted servant of\r\nhis country, and Bagration, the chivalrous descendant of kings, to the\r\ncaution and cunning of the pleasure-loving old aristocrat Kutuzov, and\r\nthe hardly disguised self-seeking of the soldier of fortune Bennigsen.\r\n\r\nKutuzov, from the field of Borodino, had sent a first brief and hasty\r\ndespatch stating that he had held his own and captured some guns. As\r\nhas been seen, the statement was only true in a general sense, since\r\nthe Russian troops had certainly been driven back a short distance.\r\nThis report was perhaps hurriedly penned in the exultation of finding\r\nthat he had fought the terrible conqueror for a long day without\r\nreal ill-success. A second despatch told the truth or something\r\nnear it, describing the battle as a drawn one--which it tactically\r\nwas--estimating Napoleon’s loss as probably the greater, and insisting\r\nupon the necessity of retreating in order to reorganise after the\r\ntremendous losses. A third despatch attributed the chief merit of the\r\nbalanced success of the day to Barclay and Bennigsen. Alexander did\r\nnot publish the second despatch--whether wisely or not it is difficult\r\nfor an Englishman to judge. Kutuzov was promoted Field Marshal, and\r\nreceived a grant of 100,000 rúbles. Barclay was decorated with the\r\norder of St. George (2nd Class), and Bennigsen with that of St.\r\nVladimir (1st Class). Bagration, who wore all the Orders of Russia,\r\nreceived a grant of 50,000 rúbles. Miloradovich, Dokhturov, Ostermann,\r\nand Raievski received the order of St. Alexander Nevski. Each soldier\r\nwas awarded a gratuity of 5 rúbles--which, it may be hoped, was paid in\r\nsilver, not in the depreciated paper currency.\r\n\r\nWhen in the midst of announcements of victory and of rewards the\r\nnews arrived that Moscow had been abandoned, the discouragement was\r\nnaturally great. In the army itself Kutuzov certainly felt very\r\ndubious of success. At St. Petersburg the state archives were sent\r\ninto the interior, and the fleet was sent to winter in England. The\r\nEmpress Dowager, the Grand Duke Constantine, and the Grand Chancellor\r\nRumiantzev, were strongly in favour of peace; but neither domestic\r\nnor political pressure, nor public alarm, appear to have shaken for a\r\nmoment the stern resolution of the commonly yielding, sensitive, and\r\ndreamy Tzar.\r\n\r\nAlexander’s reply to the fall of Moscow was a proclamation to his\r\npeople calling upon them to rise superior to the loss, and to overwhelm\r\nthe invaders, whose position was painted in colours perhaps darker than\r\nthe reality. Preparations for continuing the war were energetically\r\npushed forward. Count Lieven was despatched as ambassador to London,\r\nand with an assurance of Alexander’s immovable determination to\r\ncontinue the struggle at all hazards. For the present he asked nothing\r\nbut munitions of war. Later, when he had saved Russia, he intended\r\nto do his best to free Europe from French domination, when he hoped\r\nthat Britain would not be sparing of her wealth. At this moment, be it\r\nremembered, Napoleon was encamped among the ruins of the sacred capital\r\nof Russia.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile at Tarutino the reorganisation of the Russian army was being\r\nenergetically proceeded with. The man immediately responsible for it,\r\nwho justly received the major part of the credit, was Konovnitzin,\r\nwho has already been repeatedly met with in his country’s battles.\r\nKonovnitzin was a strong adherent and admirer of Barclay, and seems to\r\nhave possessed his chief’s virtues of modesty and devotion to duty.\r\n\r\nBorodino and the subsequent actions had grievously shattered all the\r\nregiments, and some had been practically destroyed. These were either\r\ndissolved or sent back into the interior to reform; the combined\r\nGrenadier battalions were broken up and distributed; and the militia\r\nand new recruits then drafted in. The experienced Russian generals did\r\nnot make the mistake committed by the leaders of the Spanish uprising\r\nin 1808-1809 and swamp the battalions with raw levies. Only the picked\r\nmen who had received some training were sparingly introduced among the\r\nwar-seasoned soldiers. Even so Kutuzov was very distrustful of his\r\ninfantry.\r\n\r\nHorsemen cannot be trained so easily as foot-soldiers, and the\r\nRussian cavalry could not be greatly increased in strength. Such\r\nreinforcements as it received must have consisted of small drafts and\r\nrejoining convalescents. It included the same regiments as had fought\r\nat Borodino, but all were in a greatly reduced condition. The men,\r\nhowever, were in high heart and the horses in excellent condition. The\r\nartillery was also in admirable order.\r\n\r\nAlexander had made an appeal to the loyalty of the Don Cossacks, which\r\nwas seconded by the great personal influence of Platov. By the middle\r\nof October there were present in the Moscow theatre of war some fifty\r\nregiments of irregular horsemen.\r\n\r\nReorganisation and steady reinforcement had their effect. The numerical\r\nstrength of the Russian army at Tarutino began to rise at once, and\r\nits efficiency steadily increased. The number of battalions had fallen\r\nto 147 by October 18th, but they had all been brought up to an average\r\nstrength of over 500 bayonets, except those of the Guard, which, having\r\nno depôts at hand, were rather weaker. By October 23 the strength of\r\nthe Russian Grand Army, including its detachments, had risen to 105,000\r\nregulars, including 12,000 cavalry, and nearly 20,000 Cossacks, with an\r\nartillery train of some 650 guns excellently appointed and horsed.\r\n\r\nKutuzov made certain changes in the organisation. The entire regular\r\ncavalry was massed in four unequal “Corps,” one of which consisted\r\nof Cuirassiers. Lieutenant-General Prince Golitzin I received the\r\ncommand of the Cuirassier Corps, and the 1st and 3rd were given to\r\nMajor-Generals Baron Müller Zakomelski and Vassilchikov respectively.\r\nBaron Korff continued to command the 2nd, which was increased to 8\r\nregiments of Dragoons, and 1 or 2 of light cavalry. The various army\r\ncorps still retained their old leaders, except the 3rd, which was now\r\ncommanded by Strogonov.\r\n\r\nAt the same time some changes were made in the higher commands.\r\nMiloradovich practically took the place of Bagration--by no means\r\nunworthily--while General Tormazov was called from the west to succeed\r\nBarclay.\r\n\r\nStrategically the army was organised by Kutuzov into an advanced\r\nguard, under Miloradovich, a _Corps de Bataille_, under Tormazov,\r\nsix Flying Columns, and six Cossack detachments. The advanced guard\r\nincluded the 2nd and 4th Army Corps, the 2nd and 3rd Cavalry “Corps,”\r\nand 4 regiments of Cossacks. The _Corps de Bataille_ consisted of\r\nthe 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th Army Corps, and Golitzin’s and\r\nMüller-Zakomelski’s cavalry. The Flying Columns were: (1) Platov’s,\r\ncomprising 13 regiments of Cossacks, 1 of light infantry, and a\r\nhorse battery; (2) Winzingerode’s, of 1 regiment of Hussars, 1 of\r\nDragoons, 7 of Cossacks, and a battery, observing Moscow on the\r\nnorth; (3) Dorokhov’s, observing Mozhaïsk, ultimately increased\r\nby detachments to 5 battalions, 16 squadrons, a battery, and some\r\nCossacks; (4) Orlov-Denisov’s, consisting of 6 regiments of Cossacks\r\nand 6 guns; (5) Karpov’s, comprising 7 regiments of Cossacks; and\r\n(6) that of Major-General Count Ozharovski, composed of 4 regiments\r\nof Cossacks, 1 of Hussars, a regiment of light infantry, and 6 guns.\r\nThe Cossack detachments which infested the Moscow-Smolensk road, were\r\nthose of Colonel Kaisarov (3 regiments), Colonel Prince Kudachev (2\r\nregiments), Colonel Yefremov (2 regiments), Lieutenant-Colonel Davidov\r\n(2 regiments), Captain Seslavin (1 regiment), and Captain Figner (1\r\nregiment).\r\n\r\nThe Russian army at Tarutino experienced little or no privation.\r\nSupplies of food were plentiful. Forage after a time grew scarce in\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood, and it was necessary to send to some\r\ndistance to obtain it, but the horses remained in excellent condition.\r\nLöwenstern says that the army had never fared better; it was even\r\npossible to obtain luxuries from the merchants who visited the camp.\r\nDry fuel alone was lacking. To obtain it the villages within the\r\nRussian lines were almost entirely demolished.\r\n\r\nWhile making a show of preparations for the fortification and\r\nprovisioning of Moscow the French Emperor, on October 4, sent his\r\naide-de-camp, General Lauriston, who had been Ambassador at St.\r\nPetersburg before the war, on a mission to Kutuzov. Lauriston’s real\r\nobject was to ascertain the chances of peace. It was certain that his\r\nmission could have no success. Apart from the firm resolve of the Tzar\r\nthe generals at Tarutino were bitterly determined, and kept a close\r\nwatch upon their commander-in-chief. Kutuzov consented to receive\r\nLauriston; and thereupon his subordinates requested Wilson to inform\r\nhim that if he conferred privately with Lauriston he would be deposed\r\nfrom the command. Kutuzov himself, not very confident of the ability of\r\nhis army to beat Napoleon’s, persisted in his determination to receive\r\nLauriston, but consented to do so publicly in the first instance. He\r\nthen had a private conversation with the French general, of which he\r\nafterwards gave an account to Count Langeron. He ultimately consented\r\nto pass on a letter brought by Lauriston to St. Petersburg; but\r\ndeclared that he had no power to conclude an armistice.\r\n\r\nThe successes of Schwarzenberg and St. Cyr appeared to make the French\r\nline of communications fairly safe, and the calling up of Victor’s\r\n9th Corps to Smolensk was an additional measure of security. The 9th\r\nCorps crossed the frontier on September 3. It was increased by the\r\naddition of four German regiments to a strength of 33,500 men. Victor\r\nleft Coutard’s German brigade at Vilna, and with the rest of the corps\r\nmarched for Smolensk, where he arrived on September 27. Napoleon had\r\nappointed Comte Baraguay d’Hilliers Governor-General of the province\r\nof Smolensk, but he could do little to collect supplies and keep the\r\nroads clear. The country was infested by small parties of Cossacks and\r\nof armed peasantry on the one hand, and on the other by numbers of\r\nstragglers, disbanded troops and marauders belonging to the invading\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nUntil the arrival of the 9th Corps troops were entirely lacking\r\nwherewith to suppress the disorder, and it will soon be seen that\r\nVictor could make but a brief stay at Smolensk. Baraguay d’Hilliers,\r\nworried and distracted by Napoleon’s angry complaints, gave his\r\nmaster the facts of the situation in two letters, which enable us to\r\nappreciate the precise state of things in rear of the _Grande Armée_.\r\n\r\nThe armed peasants and Cossack detachments checked foraging operations\r\nand cut off detachments. At Smolensk, indeed, there was a strong\r\ngarrison. A provisional administration had been organised, on paper,\r\nunder the superintendence of M. de Villeblanche; but the town was\r\nruined and nearly deserted. General Charpentier could organise strong\r\nforaging parties, but had no artisans to construct barracks and\r\nbakeries, or to manufacture clothing and equipment. From Smolensk\r\nto Gzhatsk there was hardly any protection for the road. Baraguay\r\nd’Hilliers declared that, after providing for the necessary garrisons\r\nof the posts, he could dispose of only 600 men, in three detachments,\r\nfor police and foraging operations on a line of some 200 miles! As to\r\nestablishing markets as Napoleon ordered, he frankly exposed the utter\r\nabsurdity of the idea. For removing wounded and forwarding supplies\r\nthere were not a fifth of the vehicles required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nMARSHAL VICTOR, DUKE OF BELLUNO\r\n\r\nCommander of the 9th French Army Corps\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by Gros at Versailles]\r\n\r\nDetachments on the march to Moscow straggled for many miles north\r\nand south of the high-road in order to forage, and it was impossible\r\nto keep them in hand. One officer, in charge of a convoy, reported\r\nthat his escorts melted away one after another; and he entered\r\nMoscow alone! The marauders committed nameless atrocities, which amply\r\nexplain and to some extent justify the terrible retaliations of the\r\npeasants during the retreat. It is an ungrateful task to allude to\r\nthese horrors, but one hideous incident given by Löwenstern must be\r\nmentioned, if only to afford a proper impression of what a state of\r\nwarfare in Napoleonic days implied.\r\n\r\nAmong the Russian leaders of irregulars Captain Figner early acquired\r\na terrible reputation for blood-thirsty cruelty towards his French\r\nand Polish foes, to whom he gave no quarter in battle, and whom,\r\nwhen captured, he massacred without pity. His savagery was strongly\r\nreprobated in the Russian army, except in the case of a number of\r\nfierce spirits whom the sufferings of their country had maddened. Even\r\nthe wild irregulars looked askance at Figner; and for the execution of\r\nhis savage orders he could not always rely upon them.\r\n\r\nFigner himself declared that he acted from conscientious motives. While\r\non one of his expeditions he surprised a marauding party--evidently\r\nconsisting of Frenchmen and Poles--in a village which they had sacked.\r\nIn the church they had penned a number of women and girls, and outraged\r\nand tortured them with horrible barbarity, crucifying them about the\r\nbuilding--partly in order the more easily to gratify their brutal lust,\r\npartly no doubt from sheer love of cruelty. Into this hideous orgy\r\nburst Figner and his Cossacks. Most of the ravishers were captured. The\r\nunhappy victims--such of them as survived--were rescued; and there and\r\nthen, before the desecrated altar, the Russian leader swore a solemn\r\noath never to spare a Frenchman. He shut his prisoners up in the church\r\nand fired it over them; and thereafter, until he was killed in the\r\nfollowing year, Frenchmen were to him but as vermin to be exterminated.\r\nIt is futile to comment upon the moral ethics of his determination.\r\nIt is only evident that in Russia, as in Spain, the brutality and\r\nlust of the French conquerors sowed the seeds of a terrible harvest of\r\nvengeance.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the disorder in Napoleon’s rear there is no doubt that\r\nthe French numbers rose steadily during the halt. Presumably the\r\nstragglers therefore--or such of them as survived the Cossacks and\r\narmed peasants--drifted in eventually. But it is hardly necessary to\r\npoint out that such a method--or lack of method--of marching was the\r\nworst possible preparation for a retreat in which strict discipline and\r\ncareful order would be before everything necessary.\r\n\r\nWhat Napoleon’s own plans were is extremely doubtful. The troops\r\ngenerally anticipated that they would winter in Moscow--but this of\r\ncourse implies nothing. Count Daru certainly suggested doing so,\r\npositively stating that to his knowledge the supplies were sufficient\r\nand shelter ample. But on the other hand the lines of communication\r\nwere already seriously threatened, and though the army in Moscow might\r\nhave been preserved it must have lost most of its horses, and Napoleon\r\nwould have been cut off from France for several months.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor is credited by Fain with the intention of advancing upon\r\nSt. Petersburg. This project was a most extraordinary one, and it\r\npasses human comprehension how Napoleon could have imagined it. It is\r\nuseless to give it in detail. The essential part is that the army is\r\nto march upon Velikii Luki, about 90 miles north-east of Polotsk, and\r\n300 from Moscow, through a fertile country (it is actually quite the\r\nreverse), and thus threaten St. Petersburg--200 miles farther on, over\r\nbarren and sparsely-peopled country. The time allowed for accomplishing\r\nthe movement appears to be about fifteen days! Farther comment is\r\nsurely unnecessary.\r\n\r\nClausewitz considers that Napoleon must always have intended to retreat\r\nby the direct road to Smolensk, the only one in any sense guarded and\r\nfurnished with magazines. On the Kaluga road, he says, the army would\r\nhave starved within a week. He therefore infers that in marching upon\r\nKaluga, as he eventually did, Napoleon merely intended to manoeuvre or\r\npush Kutuzov out of the way.\r\n\r\nThe facts, of course,--which Clausewitz may not at the time have known\r\naccurately--were that the country along the Smolensk-Viasma-Moscow\r\nroad was absolutely devastated, that forage could not be obtained upon\r\nit, while farther south matters were better; and that east of Smolensk\r\nthere were practically no magazines.\r\n\r\nJomini is of opinion that Napoleon would have done best to retreat upon\r\nVitebsk. The country, however, was poor and thinly peopled, and the\r\nroads were very bad; the only advantage of the plan was that the army\r\nwould have gained a considerable start of Kutuzov.\r\n\r\nFinally, there was the design of retiring by Kaluga on Smolensk. The\r\nroads were bad, but probably better than those on the north, since\r\nthere were upon them some considerable towns. The country was tolerably\r\nfertile and--for Russia--fairly well peopled; there were, besides,\r\nmagazines at Kaluga and elsewhere which might be captured. Further,\r\nthere was the opportunity of destroying the factories of arms and\r\nammunition at Tula.\r\n\r\nHow long Napoleon would have remained at Moscow is doubtful. His\r\norders during October for the evacuation of the hospitals show that he\r\nmeditated departure; but he still waited, hoping against hope that the\r\nstubborn Tzar would at length give way, until on October 18th came the\r\nnews that Kutuzov had taken the offensive.\r\n\r\nKutuzov himself appears not to have had very much confidence in the\r\nsolidity and ability to manoeuvre of his army. Murat’s position,\r\nhowever, was such as to tempt even a cautious commander; and Kutuzov\r\ngave way to the energetic representations of Bennigsen and Toll. An\r\nattack was fixed for October 17th, but bad staff arrangements compelled\r\nit to be postponed until the 18th. Bennigsen gives no reasons.\r\nBogdanovich and Löwenstern both blame Yermólov. Löwenstern says that\r\nrecalling the horses from their distant foraging grounds caused great\r\ndelay and that Yermólov did not inform General Baron Löwenstern, the\r\nartillery commander, in time.\r\n\r\nThe Nara, flowing from the west, turns sharply to the southward some\r\n5 miles north of Tarutino; and soon after is joined on the left by\r\nthe Chernishnia rivulet. Close to Tarutino it again turns abruptly\r\neastward. The road from Kaluga runs northward through Tarutino for\r\nnearly 5 miles to Vinkovo, a village about 2 miles from the mouth of\r\nthe Chernishnia, and then proceeds for 5 miles to Spas-Kuplia, where it\r\npasses between two woods.\r\n\r\nMurat’s line stretched from the confluence of the Chernishnia with\r\nthe Nara to the hamlet of Teterinka, some 5 miles to the westward,\r\nand about 4 south of Spas-Kuplia. Vinkovo, which lay south of the\r\nChernishnia, was occupied by Claparède’s Poles, supported by the 3rd\r\nCavalry Corps, under General St. Germain, and a division of the 1st.\r\nTo the left rear of Vinkovo lay Dufour’s division, with the rest of\r\nNansouty’s cavalry corps on its left. Still farther to the south of the\r\nChernishnia stood Poniatowski’s corps, with Sebastiani’s cavalry on the\r\nextreme left. Latour-Maubourg was watching the Nara on the right rear.\r\nMurat’s whole strength hardly exceeded 25,000 men; he was encumbered\r\nrather than supported by about 180 miserably horsed guns; and his 9000\r\nor 10,000 cavalry were in a wretched state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF BATTLE OF VINKOVO, OCTOBER 18TH, 1812\r\n\r\nGeneral position at moment when Murat’s retreat began]\r\n\r\nThe Russian plan contemplated a demonstration by part of the bulk\r\nof the army against Murat’s extended front, while Bennigsen, with a\r\nforce composed of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Corps, Müller Zakomelski’s\r\ncavalry, and 10 regiments of Cossacks under Orlov-Denisov, turned his\r\nleft. Miloradovich was to move towards Vinkovo with Korff’s and\r\nVassilchikov’s cavalry, while behind him the rest of the army debouched\r\nfrom Tarutino.\r\n\r\nOrlov-Denisov and Müller Zakomelski fell, about 7 a.m. on the 18th,\r\nupon Sebastiani’s bivouacs, while Baggohufwudt attacked the 5th Corps\r\nin front. His advance had been revealed by the growing light and\r\nsome premature shots, and the Poles were able to form and oppose a\r\nvigorous resistance. One of the first shots from their artillery killed\r\nBaggohufwudt, and his fall rather dashed some of his young troops,\r\nespecially when the remains of the French Carabiniers, led by Murat\r\nhimself, gallantly charged the 48th Russian Chasseurs. The Russian\r\ncavalry on the right, however, swept away Sebastiani, capturing most\r\nof his baggage and artillery, and pushed on towards Spas-Kuplia, which\r\nthey occupied, thus cutting Murat’s line of retreat. The position would\r\nhave been critical had the Russian horsemen been supported by infantry.\r\nThe whole of the French line gave back in haste, but the Russian 2nd\r\nCorps, imposed upon by Murat’s bold charge, and shaken by the fall\r\nof its leader, followed very cautiously. Ostermann-Tolstoï failed to\r\nadvance with the necessary speed; and Bennigsen thought himself obliged\r\nto hold back the 3rd Corps until the arrival of the 4th. The result was\r\nthat the entire French army, in great disorder, indeed, and suffering\r\nconsiderably from the Russian artillery fire, succeeded in effecting\r\nits retreat. Orlov-Denisov and Müller Zakomelski were obliged to\r\nabandon Spas-Kuplia as infantry came up; and the line of retreat was\r\nclear. Meanwhile Kutuzov was executing his part of the programme very\r\nslowly or not at all. Only Miloradovich’s cavalry, supported by five\r\ninfantry regiments, crossed the Chernishnia and pressed the rear of the\r\nretreating columns towards and through Spas-Kuplia, where the pursuit\r\nceased. Murat retreated to Voronovo, where he rallied his shaken\r\ntroops, while the Russian main body tranquilly returned to Tarutino.\r\nMiloradovich with the now formally constituted advance-guard was\r\nstationed at Vinkovo.\r\n\r\nThe French returns, which are manifestly incomplete, show a loss of\r\n2795 men, of whom 1151 were prisoners or missing. The bulk of the\r\ndiminution was in the 5th Corps and Sebastiani’s cavalry; Claparède and\r\nDufour were scarcely engaged. Two generals were killed and two wounded.\r\nThe Russians claim to have lost only 502 killed and wounded. They\r\ncaptured 37 guns, a standard, and a mass of baggage.\r\n\r\nBennigsen was exasperated at Kutuzov’s tardy and slight support, though\r\nhis own conduct had not been too energetic, and the breach between them\r\nwidened. It was already great, Kutuzov relying upon the retiring and\r\nhard-working Konovnitzin far more than on Bennigsen.\r\n\r\nThe Russian success at Vinkovo, incomplete as it was, none the less\r\ndealt a heavy blow to the already shaken _morale_ of the Napoleonic\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nAs the period of Napoleon’s evacuation of Moscow has now been reached,\r\nit appears necessary to survey the positions occupied by the various\r\nsections of the opposing forces.\r\n\r\nDealing first with the invaders--\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Guard, Grand Head-quarters, the Cavalry Reserve, and the\r\nbulk of the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 5th Army Corps were encamped, under\r\nNapoleon’s personal command, in the environs of Moscow. About Mozhaïsk\r\nwas the 8th Corps, under Junot, the total combatant strength of this,\r\nthe original Grand or Central Army, including engineers, gendarmerie,\r\netc., being nearly 125,000 men.\r\n\r\nAt Viasma was a column of drafts under General Evers, which with the\r\ngarrisons at Gzhatsk and elsewhere may be estimated at about 5000 men.\r\n\r\nAbout Smolensk there were the 129th and Illyrian regiments from\r\nNey’s corps, three 3rd battalions of the Vistula Legion, and some\r\nof the Hesse-Darmstadt Guards belonging to the Imperial Guard, a\r\nMecklenburg regiment and a battalion of the 33rd Léger (1st Corps); a\r\nPolish cavalry regiment (5th Corps); and about 8000 men in _régiments\r\nde marche_--say 16,000 in all, including 1500 cavalry under General\r\nBaraguay d’Hilliers.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Smolensk also was cantoned the 9th Corps, under\r\nVictor, some 26,000 strong.\r\n\r\nAt Vitebsk and in its neighbourhood were a battalion of the 9th Corps\r\nand a few drafts--say 1000 men.\r\n\r\nBetween Smolensk and Orsha there were in garrison perhaps 3000\r\nmen--drafts, convalescents, engineers, and Polish levies.\r\n\r\nAt Mohilev were 1 infantry and 1 cavalry regiment of Dombrowski’s\r\ndivision, about 1500 men. The rest of the division, about 5500 men with\r\n20 guns, was spread to the south-westward.\r\n\r\nAt Minsk and Borisov and scattered about the neighbourhood there were\r\n2 weak French battalions, some depôt troops of various nations, a\r\nweak Württemberg infantry regiment, and 4 battalions and 4 squadrons\r\nof untrustworthy Lithuanian levies--less than 6000 in all, under\r\nGeneral Bronikowski. At Slonim General Konopka was organising the new\r\nLithuanian Lancer Regiment of the Guard, which with a few other levies\r\nmay be estimated at 1000 men.\r\n\r\nBetween Minsk and Kovno there were various depôts, _régiments de\r\nmarche_, and a number of Polish and Lithuanian levies, totalling\r\nperhaps 14,000 men, and Coutard’s brigade of the 9th Corps, 2500 strong.\r\n\r\nIn Kurland and before Riga Macdonald’s 10th Corps now numbered perhaps\r\n26,000 men.\r\n\r\nIn and about Polotsk lay the 2nd Corps, the remains of the infantry\r\nof the 6th, and Doumerc’s Cuirassier Division--about 30,000\r\ncombatants--under Marshal St. Cyr.\r\n\r\nSchwarzenberg had at Wengrow, Bielostok, and elsewhere about 37,000\r\nmen, comprising 22,000 Austrians, nearly 10,000 Saxons, and about 5000\r\nPoles. Marching to join him were 5000 Austrians, and a French division\r\n(Durutte) of the 11th Corps, 13,000 strong.\r\n\r\nAt Königsberg and in the neighbourhood was Loison’s division of the\r\n11th Corps, 13,000 men, French, German, and Neapolitans.\r\n\r\nIn addition there were in Poland and Prussia, in garrison or moving up\r\nto the front, about 21,000 men of various arms.\r\n\r\nThe total force of the Napoleonic army, therefore, on Russian soil or\r\nabout to move across the frontier was, in the middle of October, some\r\n351,000 men.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, for the most part along the line of the Oder, was the\r\nrest of the 11th Corps, under Marshal Augereau. It consisted of\r\ntwo provisional divisions under Generals Heudelet and Lagrange, a\r\nNeapolitan division in Danzig under General d’Estrées, Cavaignac’s\r\ncavalry brigade, and some detached troops, amounting, with artillery,\r\nto about 40,000 men; besides perhaps 27,000 drafts. Of these troops,\r\n67,000 in all, about 55,000 were on the Vistula at the close of the\r\ncampaign. Adding these to the 351,000 troops already beyond that river\r\nthe total of Napoleonic troops still bearing on Russia was 406,000. As\r\nthe aggregate employed during the campaign has been elsewhere estimated\r\nat 674,000, it results that 268,000 men had already disappeared from\r\nthe fighting line. Some, no doubt, had returned home invalided, some\r\nhad been taken by the Russians; a certain number had no doubt fallen\r\ninto good hands in the country and ultimately recovered from their\r\ninjuries. But by far the larger number were already dead.\r\n\r\nTo these 406,000 actual and prospective enemies Russia opposed the\r\nfollowing forces:--\r\n\r\nAt and near Tarutino and around Moscow, under Field-Marshal Prince\r\nGolénischev-Kutuzov, were 105,000 regulars and 20,000 irregulars. Under\r\nWittgenstein, near Polotsk, were 40,000 regulars, irregulars, and\r\nmilitia. Marching to reinforce Wittgenstein was Count Steingell with\r\n10,000 men, almost all regulars. At Riga, under Essen I, there were\r\nperhaps 15,000 troops.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Chichagov had under his general command about 70,000 men in\r\nall, including General Lüder’s division coming from Serbia. Ertel at\r\nMozyr now had about 14,000, while Bobruisk was garrisoned by 6000.\r\nFinally, in small regular detachments, drafts of recruits and militia,\r\nand Cossacks, there were perhaps 30,000 men on the march to reinforce\r\nthe various armies. The Russian total therefore was nearly 310,000 men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STAGES OF THE RETREAT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe battle of Vinkovo put an abrupt end to any hopes which Napoleon may\r\nyet have cherished as to a speedy conclusion of peace. It is fairly\r\nobvious, however, that he had already made up his mind that Moscow\r\nmust be abandoned. On October 14th orders were reiterated to evacuate\r\nthe hospitals at Mozhaïsk and elsewhere by the 20th. Junot was also\r\ndirected to destroy arms which could not be carried away. Evers’ column\r\nof reinforcement, which had already passed Viasma, was turned back to\r\nthat town; and other _régiments de marche_ were ordered to remain at,\r\nor return to, Smolensk.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the army needs careful consideration. Montholon,\r\nwho may be regarded as speaking for his master, says that it was\r\nstrengthened and revivified by its long rest, that it had twenty days’\r\nsupply of food, that it was abundantly provided with ammunition.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that this categorical _apologia_ does not mention\r\nthe vitally important matters of discipline, clothing, and horses. Of\r\nthese something will presently be said. The points noted by Montholon\r\nmay be discussed one by one.\r\n\r\nIn the first place a distinction must be drawn between the troops in\r\nand about Moscow and those belonging to Murat’s advance-guard.\r\n\r\nOf the former, it may be said that they were, as regards the men, in\r\nfair physical condition. Even here, however, a distinction must be\r\nmade. The Guards and the 1st Corps had been lying inactive for four\r\nweeks. They had had the benefit of the best that Moscow could afford;\r\nand certainly should have been in first-rate condition. But, on the\r\nother hand, they had been living freely, upon food not always as\r\nnourishing as attractive to rough men, and upon the wines and spirits\r\nwhich abounded in the palaces and warehouses, and were probably hardly\r\nprepared for new and terrible hardships. The 3rd and 4th Corps had been\r\ngenerally encamped outside Moscow, had obtained little by pillage, and\r\nhad been uselessly fatigued and over-worked by constant foraging and\r\noutpost work. Yet it is possible that these unpampered men were really\r\nbetter prepared for what lay before them than the Guards and Davout’s\r\ncorps.\r\n\r\nAs to the question of food supplies it is difficult to express an\r\nopinion. It is certain that food was not lacking, and probably the\r\ntroops might have carried with them twenty days’ rations had discipline\r\nbeen good and transport abundant. As it is, it is clear that the army\r\nwas short of supplies within ten days of its departure from Moscow.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to doubt Napoleon’s statement that the supply of\r\nammunition was abundant.\r\n\r\nNapoleon having, according to his custom, dealt entirely with material\r\nmatters, it may be well to follow in his footsteps before considering\r\nthings moral. The evidence of survivors is all to the effect that the\r\ntroops were badly and inadequately clothed. Except in so far as some of\r\nthem were supplied from the pillage of Moscow the men had only the worn\r\nand tattered uniforms which had served them all through the advance.\r\nThe footgear was much worn, and the underclothing in a deplorable\r\ncondition. Bourgogne, a sergeant in the Young Guard--one of a favoured\r\ncorps, therefore--speaks of wearing a shirt until it rotted upon him.\r\nOnly on the 17th of October were leather and linen issued, and it was\r\nthen too late to make up the material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH OF VASILII BLAGORENNYI AT MOSCOW\r\n\r\nBuilt by the famous Tzar Ivan the Terrible in the latter half of the\r\n16th century]\r\n\r\nWhatever might be the state of the army’s supplies it lacked transport\r\nfor them. The horses were dying steadily from fatigue, sickness and,\r\nabove all, lack of food. The state of the cavalry has been noticed,\r\nand the artillery and trains were naturally in equally bad condition.\r\nNapoleon refused to abandon any of his vast and wretchedly horsed\r\nartillery in order to lighten the dead weight which encumbered the\r\nmarch. It would have been wiser to leave behind a part of the enormous\r\nmass of ammunition and to fill up the artillery waggons with food\r\nor forage. The commander of the artillery of the Young Guard did do\r\nsomething of the kind, with good results, but for the most part the\r\ndread of Napoleon effectually hindered such common-sense action. The\r\ndraft horses, in bad condition, and overloaded in any case, without\r\nconsidering non-military and unnecessary further additions, began to\r\ndie at the very beginning of the retreat, and the artillery and trains\r\nwere lost piecemeal. Much of what food and forage the army took with it\r\nwas lost early, owing to the failure of the transport.\r\n\r\nOne fact is curious and inexplicable. It might have been thought that\r\nthe most strenuous exertions would have been put forth to provide the\r\nindividual soldiers with plenty of breadstuffs, when the deficiency of\r\nthe transport was well known. There is evidence that food was left in\r\nMoscow. De Fezensac states that he made a present of the flour which he\r\ncould not carry away to some Muscovites whom he had fed during his stay\r\nin the city. The incident does honour to his humanity. Yet one wonders\r\nwhy he did not distribute it among his soldiers, who were ere long\r\ndying of want. It is clear that little food was carried by the soldiers\r\nthemselves, and the reason for this is probably connected with the low\r\n_morale_ of the army.\r\n\r\nA long course of excess of every kind had weakened such sense of\r\nhonour as the bulk of the men possessed, and the scattered barracking\r\nnecessitated by the destruction of the greater part of the city\r\nrendered the maintenance of order very difficult. So far as can be\r\njudged, constant drill was by no means a feature of the Napoleonic\r\narmy, and inspections of kits were apparently often perfunctory. It is,\r\nat any rate, certain that they were so during the sojourn in Moscow.\r\nHaversacks and knapsacks, instead of being stored with necessaries,\r\ntoo often contained plunder. The officers either made no determined\r\nattempt to check the evil, or their efforts were without avail. It is\r\nprobable that the former discreditable condition of affairs actually\r\nobtained. Brigandage was rife in the Napoleonic armies, and numbers of\r\nofficers had their private vehicles laden with plunder. Generals were\r\noften no better. Napoleon himself added to the encumbrances of the army\r\ntwo convoys of spoils, one of gold and silver bullion, the presence\r\nof which may be justified, the other of objects of purely sentimental\r\nvalue, for which excuse can hardly be made. It was but another example\r\nof the paltry spirit which impelled Napoleon to desecrate the tomb of\r\nFrederick the Great. It is difficult to blame subordinate officers when\r\ntheir ruler and their generals set so evil an example, still less is\r\nit possible to find fault with the ignorant soldiery. Be this as it\r\nmay, lack of discipline, fostered by a low sense of honour among the\r\nofficers, and greed of plunder, was not the least of the causes of the\r\ndestruction of the _Grande Armée_.\r\n\r\nFinally, the pernicious practice of permitting the troops to march in\r\ndisorder was soon to be productive of fatal consequences. Officers and\r\nmen had grown so accustomed to it that its extent was probably not at\r\nfirst realised, and it soon became impossible to check it. The results\r\nwere terrible. The worse element among the suffering troops had every\r\nopportunity for disbanding, and the Russian irregulars, who could\r\nachieve little against closed bodies of infantry, were able to commit\r\nimmense havoc.\r\n\r\nOver and above all this the army was encumbered by a disproportionate\r\nthrong of non-combatants. Besides the ordinary camp-followers, male\r\nand female, it has already been observed that there were with the army\r\na number of persons--partly women--who should not have been permitted\r\nto accompany it. There were sick and wounded to the number of at least\r\nseveral thousands at the outset. The French colony at Moscow mostly\r\nfled with the army. Also a number of Russian prostitutes, and even a\r\ngood many women and girls of better stamp--including some of the upper\r\nclasses--accompanied men who had formed connections with them.\r\n\r\nThe precise state of feeling in the army cannot be ascertained. There\r\nis no doubt that the struggle at Borodino had badly affected its\r\n_morale_, and the French troops at least with their quick intelligence\r\nmust have looked forward to the future with dread. On the other hand,\r\ntheir natural light-heartedness and their belief in Napoleon probably\r\nsustained their spirits. The foreign element was, doubtless, even less\r\nhopeful. That the more reflective among the officers were filled with\r\nmisgiving is indubitable; and there was much discouragement among the\r\ngenerals, many of whom, besides, were war-weary and yearned for rest.\r\n\r\nThus, disorganised, with discipline shattered, ill clothed, ill\r\nsupplied, deficient in transport but laden with useless plunder,\r\nencumbered with sick, wounded, and helpless non-combatants, and with\r\ndemoralisation latent everywhere, the _Grande Armée_ set out from\r\nNapoleon’s Farthest to fight its way home. It is perhaps difficult\r\nto see things in their true light, every effort at so doing being\r\nnaturally affected by knowledge of succeeding events. But the\r\nconclusion can hardly be avoided that the fate of the _Grande Armée_\r\nwas already sealed, and that the shadow of impending disaster lay\r\ndarkly upon its disorderly columns.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of the Napoleonic host on leaving Moscow can only be\r\napproximately computed. The dates of the muster-rolls collected by De\r\nChambray vary so much that they can only be taken as a general guide.\r\nThere are also errors in the published tables, the 8th Corps having\r\n4916 infantry and artillery instead of 1916. De Chambray also, with\r\nall his merits, has the failing, natural enough indeed, and entirely\r\nexcusable, of rather under-rating French numbers. An example of this\r\nmay be seen in his estimate of Napoleon’s strength at Borodino.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, working upon the muster-rolls collected by De Chambray,\r\nthe marching-out strength of Napoleon’s army from Moscow would appear\r\nto have been approximately as follows:--\r\n\r\n --------------------------------+------------+----------+---------+------\r\n             Corps.              | Infantry,  | Mounted  | Total.  | Guns.\r\n                                 | Artillery, | Cavalry. |         |\r\n                                 | Dismounted |          |         |\r\n                                 | Cavalry.   |          |         |\r\n --------------------------------+------------+----------+---------+------\r\n Grand Quarter-General           |   3,000    |  1,000   |   4,000 |  ?\r\n Imperial Guard                  |  19,000    |  4,000   |  23,000 |\r\n 1st Army Corps                  |  30,000    |  1,000   |  31,000 |\r\n 3rd  ”     ”                    |  10,500    |  1,000   |  11,500 |\r\n 4th  ”     ”                    |  26,000    |  1,500   |  27,500 |\r\n 5th  ”     ”                    |   5,000    |  1,000   |   6,000 |\r\n 8th  ”     ”                    |   5,000    |    750   |   5,750 |\r\n Cavalry Reserve                 |   1,000    |  5,000   |   6,000 |\r\n Brigade of Dismounted Horsemen  |   4,000    |          |   4,000 |\r\n Artillery Parks, Engineers,   } |            |          |         |\r\n Pontonniers, Gendarmerie, etc.} |   5,000    |    500   |   5,500 |\r\n                                 +------------+----------+---------+------\r\n                                 | 108,500    | 15,750   | 124,250 | 600\r\n --------------------------------+------------+----------+---------+------\r\n\r\nThe precise number of guns is not very certain, and to compute it\r\nis a somewhat unnecessary task. But, including the spare pieces in\r\nthe reserve parks, and allowing for losses and reinforcements, the\r\ntotal must have been in the neighbourhood of 600. There were over\r\n2000 artillery vehicles, for the most part heavily laden and very\r\ninadequately horsed.\r\n\r\nThe trains, already enormous, were now still further augmented by\r\nquantities of carts and carriages of every kind taken in Moscow, and\r\nrequisitioned to transport food, wounded, refugees, and plunder. The\r\nbulk of the troops had made additions to their worn uniforms in the\r\nshape of garments of all kinds, often female ones, ransacked from\r\nthe shops and warehouses. The effect must at the time have appeared\r\nfantastic and comical; but the humour of the sight was soon to be\r\nquenched in horror.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that on the 14th orders had been issued which\r\nforeshadowed the evacuation of Moscow; and on the 16th Napoleon wrote\r\nto Maret at Vilna, setting forth his intentions. He would march\r\nagainst and defeat Kutuzov, take Kaluga, and then act according to\r\ncircumstances. He would probably eventually go into winter quarters\r\nbetween Minsk and Smolensk, as Moscow did not afford a satisfactory\r\nmilitary position. The Emperor made a final attempt to induce Kutuzov\r\nto open negotiations, but, of course, without result. He was in one of\r\nhis worst moods, raging at his want of success, and the savage side of\r\nhis nature displayed itself in all its nakedness in the disgraceful\r\norders to blow up the Kremlin and its sacred and historic buildings.\r\n\r\nFrom Moscow two roads led to Kaluga. The western one went by the\r\ntowns of Fominskoië, Borovsk and Maloyaroslavetz, that to the east\r\nby Voronovo and Tarutino. The eastern road is the more direct of\r\nthe two, and is roughly the chord of the shallow arc of a circle\r\ndescribed by the other. From Borovsk a cross-road leads by Vereia to\r\nGzhatsk. From Maloyaroslavetz a fairly good highway goes eastward and\r\nsouth-eastward by Medyn to Yukhnov, and thence by Ielnia to Smolensk.\r\nThe two Moscow-Kaluga roads are farthest apart between Tarutino and\r\nBorovsk, the latter place being some 20 miles distant from the former\r\nand slightly to the north-east of it. Maloyaroslavetz is about 11 miles\r\nsouth of Borovsk, and some 22 by road from Tarutino. It is thus evident\r\nthat it was a point of great strategic importance.\r\n\r\nThe positions of the opposing armies were as follows: On the French\r\nside Murat’s force was near Voronovo, some 18 miles north of Tarutino.\r\nAt Fominskoië, 15 or 16 miles west of Voronovo, was Broussier’s\r\ndivision of the 4th Corps, which had been sent thither a few days\r\nearlier. Junot, with the 8th Corps, was about Mozhaïsk. The rest of the\r\n_Grande Armée_ was in and around Moscow.\r\n\r\nMarshal Kutuzov was encamped with his _Corps de Bataille_ about\r\nTarutino, while Miloradovich with the advance-guard was pushed forward\r\nto observe Murat. Platov’s Flying Corps and other light detachments\r\nwere in the vicinity of Tarutino; Dorokhov was at Vereia; and\r\nWinzingerode’s cavalry observed Moscow, as before, on the north and\r\neast.\r\n\r\nMarshal Mortier was left by Napoleon to complete the evacuation of\r\nMoscow and to execute the abominable order to destroy the Kremlin. He\r\nhad under his command Laborde’s division of the Young Guard, Charrier’s\r\nbrigade of dismounted troopers, a brigade of light cavalry, and some\r\nartillery and sappers--about 9000 men in all. He was to hold the\r\nKremlin for a few days and to give out that Napoleon would soon return,\r\nwhile clearing the ruins of such wounded, non-combatants and refugees.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the Guard, the 1st, 3rd and 4th Corps, began to evacuate\r\nMoscow in the night of October 18-19. There was great confusion, owing\r\nto the crowding of the trains into the Moscow-Kaluga road, and the\r\nmarch was slow. Recklessness and the breakdown of discipline were\r\neverywhere apparent. When the 3rd Corps reached its rendezvous at\r\nthe monastery of Semenovski it was found to be in flames, and it is\r\nastounding to read that quantities of provisions were burned in it. It\r\nis useless to seek for excuse for the commission of such an act; it was\r\nsimple insanity.\r\n\r\nThe army advanced along the eastern road directly upon Tarutino. Eugène\r\nopened the march, and behind him came the 1st and 3rd Corps and the\r\nGuard. The advance by the western road appeared to threaten a frontal\r\nattack on the position of Tarutino, but on reaching the Pakhra, the\r\nEmperor diverted the columns on to the western route. Murat’s force\r\nwas broken up. The King himself with the relics of the 1st, 2nd and\r\n3rd Cavalry Corps was directed upon Fominskoië; Poniatowski’s corps on\r\nVereia, to recover that place from Dorokhov. Ney was to take Murat’s\r\nplace at Voronovo, the Vistula Legion, the remains of the 4th Cavalry\r\nCorps and the cavalry of the 1st Corps being also placed at his\r\ndisposal. He had in all about 16,000 men and over 100 guns--sufficient\r\nunder his resolute leadership to hold Miloradovich in check. There was\r\nalso the possibility that his presence at Voronovo would induce Kutuzov\r\nto believe that the whole French army was advancing by the eastern\r\nroad; and in any case it would divert attention from the flank movement\r\nby the western one.\r\n\r\nThe diversion of the advance to the western road was a well-conceived\r\nmanoeuvre, and had it been carried out with greater rapidity it might\r\nhave achieved brilliant results. The distance to Maloyaroslavetz by\r\nthe French line of march is about 72 miles, which the leading troops\r\ncovered by the evening of the 23rd. As the roads were poor and the\r\ncross-tracks unspeakable, and there was besides some rain to make them\r\nworse, the army cannot be said to have done badly. But its march,\r\nencumbered as it was by interminable trains of artillery and baggage,\r\nwas not speedy enough for the emergency. The attention of the Russian\r\nstaff, indeed, appears to have been riveted upon the eastern road,\r\nfor it was not until the 22nd that Kutuzov learned that there were\r\nFrench troops at Fominskoië. Considering that it was probably merely a\r\npowerful screen for foraging operations, Kutuzov directed Dokhturov,\r\nwith the 6th Corps and the light cavalry of the Imperial Guard, to\r\nattack and drive it back. Miloradovich was ordered to demonstrate\r\nagainst the force in his front so as to prevent it detaching succours\r\nto the division at Fominskoië. This was on the evening of the 22nd.\r\nEugène’s corps, with Delzons’ division leading, was between Fominskoië\r\nand Borovsk; Davout and the Guard were about Fominskoië. At midnight on\r\nthe 23rd Ney started from Voronovo for Borovsk in pouring rain which\r\nsimply obliterated the tracks and seriously impeded the march. He\r\nwas also harassed by detachments of Cossacks. Poniatowski arrived at\r\nVereia early on the 23rd and, after some fighting, drove out Dorokhov,\r\nwho retired by cross-roads towards Maloyaroslavetz. Late on the same\r\nday Delzons occupied Maloyaroslavetz with his advanced guard of two\r\nbattalions.\r\n\r\nDokhturov, accompanied by Yermólov and by Sir Robert Wilson, left\r\nTarutino early on the 23rd. The 6th Corps, owing to its terrible losses\r\nat Borodino, was only 10 regiments strong, even with the addition of\r\none or two from corps which had suffered less. One of them, moreover,\r\nwas detached to Ozharovski’s column. Dokhturov had, therefore, only\r\n18 battalions, 7 batteries and the 3 regiments of the light cavalry\r\nof the Guard--about 12,000 men in all, with 84 guns. By the afternoon\r\nhe had arrived at a point 5 or 6 miles from the western road, between\r\nFominskoië and Borovsk, and there received information that 12,000\r\nFrench troops were in his front. He consulted with his subordinates\r\nand with Wilson, and it was decided, rightly, to halt and await\r\nevents, since if this body were isolated it would probably remain on\r\nthe defensive. If, on the other hand, it continued to advance it was\r\nprobably the head of a formidable force--perhaps the entire French\r\narmy. Very soon intelligence came from Seslavin that Moscow was\r\nevacuated and the French army marching across from the eastern road to\r\nFominskoië; and immediately afterwards a report from Dorokhov announced\r\nthat a Cossack post at Borovsk had been expelled by Delzons. Dokhturov\r\npromptly took his decision. He could no longer hope to intercept the\r\nFrench at Borovsk, so must make a dash for Maloyaroslavetz, and there\r\nbar the road. He sent off word to Tarutino of his intelligence and\r\nintentions, and started his force for the vital point, arriving there\r\nin the night of the 23rd-24th.\r\n\r\nNapoleon himself reached Borovsk on the 23rd. Thence he despatched\r\norders to Baraguay d’Hilliers to move out from Smolensk towards Ielnia.\r\nHe evidently expected to carry out his manoeuvre without hindrance. In\r\na letter to Eugène, dated at 7.30 p.m., he appears to have discovered\r\nthe presence of Dokhturov, but to have anticipated an attack on the\r\nflank of his columns rather than an attempt to bar his way. As he\r\ndictated this despatch all the Russian commanders in touch with him\r\nhad full information of his manoeuvre, Kutuzov had been warned, and\r\nDokhturov was marching hard for Maloyaroslavetz!\r\n\r\nAt 1 a.m. Mortier in Moscow ordered the firing of the mines which had\r\nbeen laid under the buildings in the Kremlin and elsewhere. They were\r\ncharged with 183,000 pounds of powder, and great damage was wrought,\r\nbut by no means the complete destruction intended by Napoleon. Mortier,\r\nwho hated the ignominious task which he had been set by his master,\r\nis said, doubtless with truth, to have been by no means sorry at the\r\ncomparatively small results of the Emperor’s vandalism.\r\n\r\nWinzingerode, who was already in the suburbs with his troops, pressed\r\nforward rather inconsiderately to reoccupy the Kremlin, riding himself\r\nin advance without an escort, attended only by a single aide-de-camp.\r\nThe result was that he was taken prisoner, though he made a\r\ndishonourable, if not entirely inexcusable, attempt to escape by waving\r\nhis handkerchief and pretending to have come on a parley. Mortier quite\r\nrightly declined to listen, and detained him. The evacuation was then\r\ncompleted. The Marshal made the most strenuous efforts to save all the\r\ninvalids and to alleviate their sufferings as far as possible, but so\r\ngreat was the deficiency of transport that many hundreds had to be left\r\nbehind. Eighteen guns, doubtless rendered unserviceable, were also\r\nabandoned. The gigantic convoy, guarded by Mortier’s small force,\r\nmoved not by the main road to Smolensk, but by cross roads on Vereia.\r\n\r\nAt Tarutino Kutuzov during the 23rd received the intelligence sent\r\nby Miloradovich and Dokhturov. The hour is a little doubtful, but he\r\ncannot have received Dokhturov’s report until late in the day, and\r\nit was not possible to march at once owing to the absence of a large\r\npart of the artillery horses, which, as before the action of Vinkovo,\r\nhad been led far away to obtain forage. The blame freely lavished\r\nupon Kutuzov for dilatoriness seems to be without foundation; there\r\nwas no unnecessary delay. To set forth to encounter Napoleon without\r\nthe artillery would have been unwise to the verge of insanity. As a\r\nfact, supposing the final information to have reached the camp about\r\n4 p.m., six or seven hours was not too long in which to call in the\r\nparties and make preparations for the march. Platov was sent off at\r\nonce with 15 regiments of Cossacks to observe and harass the march of\r\nNapoleon’s column, and at 11 p.m. the rest of the army started for\r\nMaloyaroslavetz. The distance, allowing for deviations, was about 25\r\nmiles, mostly over an execrable byway rendered almost impassable by\r\nthe pouring rain. Nevertheless, the Russians pushed doggedly forward,\r\nand by 11 a.m. on the 24th the head of the column was within reach of\r\nMaloyaroslavetz. Seeing that Ney, who on this same night was moving\r\nacross from the eastern road, did not reach Borovsk until the evening\r\nof the 26th, having occupied three days in covering about 36 miles, the\r\ngreatest credit is due to the Russian army.\r\n\r\nDokhturov with his force reached Maloyaroslavetz in the night of the\r\n23rd-24th. Either now or soon after daylight on the 24th he was joined\r\nby Dorokhov from Vereia. His troops must have been nearly dead beat,\r\nbut he managed to spread them round the town so as to hold the outlets\r\nof all the roads which led out of it. He, of course, did not know that\r\nthere were only two battalions holding the town; but Buturlin’s blame\r\nof him for not carrying it is unreasonable. His men had been marching\r\nfor nearly an entire day and night, and it was indispensably necessary\r\nto allow them some rest.\r\n\r\nMaloyaroslavetz, an ordinary Russian country town built almost entirely\r\nof wood, lay on the southern bank of the small river Luzha, at the\r\npoint where it was crossed by a bridge carrying the Moscow-Kaluga road.\r\nThe river, like most streams in the region, flows in a deeply sunk\r\nchannel. Below the bridge there were, according to Wilson, fords, but\r\nthe Russians did not need them, and the French knew nothing of them.\r\nIn any case, neither side attempted to use them. The country was very\r\nbroken and also wooded, and the banks of the river, especially the\r\nsouthern one, were very steep. There were a few isolated buildings near\r\nthe stream, while the town proper lay some hundreds of yards farther\r\non, spreading over the top of the rise on to a plateau with a slight\r\ndescent to the southward. The only good artillery position on the\r\nRussian side was eastward of the town, but though from it the opposite\r\nbank of the Luzha, down which the enemy must come, could be commanded,\r\nthe ground was so broken and wooded that the bridge could nowhere be\r\nseen, and it was never apparently seriously injured.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 24th some fugitive inhabitants made their way to\r\nDokhturov, and informed him that there were as yet only two battalions\r\nof French troops in the town. Accordingly soon after daylight, his men\r\nhaving by this obtained a little rest, he sent forward the 6th and 33rd\r\nChasseur Regiments to carry the town. They expelled the garrison from\r\nnearly the whole of the place, but the buildings near the bridge formed\r\na sort of _tête du pont_, which the French held desperately. Dokhturov\r\nsupported the attack by two more Chasseur regiments, but the resistance\r\nwas stubborn, and the Russians could not advance against the deadly\r\nfire kept up upon them. Delzons could at first only reinforce the\r\ngallant garrison by fragments and driblets, for when his main body\r\nendeavoured to defile down the northern bank Dokhturov rapidly brought\r\na line of batteries into action east of the town and effectually\r\nchecked them. About an hour later some batteries of the 4th Corps,\r\nwhich were toiling along the miry road, were ranged by the Viceroy\r\nopposite the Russian artillery, and thus covered Delzons’ division\r\ncrossed the bridge and recaptured the town.\r\n\r\nDokhturov thereupon restored the fight with three line regiments,\r\nwhich rallied the Chasseurs and stormed through the streets of\r\nMaloyaroslavetz, driving the 13th Division back towards the bridge.\r\nBaron Delzons was killed in the midst of the struggle, and as his\r\nbrother and aide-de-camp endeavoured to carry his body to the rear\r\nhe also was struck down. Baron Guilleminot, Eugène’s chief-of-staff,\r\ntook the command, rallied the division and, supported by part of\r\nBroussier’s, which was beginning to arrive, again stormed the now\r\nburning town, only to be forced out again as Dokhturov sent in fresh\r\nreinforcements. Once more the Russian charge was checked at the bridge;\r\nand Broussier and Guilleminot, with their united divisions, again drove\r\nthe 6th Corps through the blazing town, but could not debouch from it\r\nin the face of the Russian artillery fire.\r\n\r\nThe main armies were approaching the scene of action. Davout’s corps\r\nwas advancing from Borovsk to the support of Eugène; the main Russian\r\narmy was nearing the field from Tarutino. Raievski’s corps marched\r\nat the head of the long column, and behind him came in succession\r\nthe 8th, 3rd, 5th, 2nd and 4th Corps, and Korff’s, Golitizin’s and\r\nVassilchikov’s cavalry. The aged commander-in-chief travelled during\r\nthe night in his carriage. When about 3 or 4 miles from Maloyaroslavetz\r\nhe halted and ordered Colonel Löwenstern to see Dokhturov to report.\r\nThe whole of the 6th Corps was now engaged and forced on the\r\ndefensive by Broussier and Guilleminot; and of this Löwenstern informed\r\nthe commander-in-chief. Kutuzov sent Raievski forward at once to the\r\nassistance of Dokhturov, ordered the other corps to march upon the field\r\nwith all speed, and himself mounted his horse and hurried to the front\r\nto range his oncoming troops in line of battle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF BATTLE OF MALOYAROSLAVETZ, OCTOBER 24TH, 1812]\r\n\r\nRaievski’s leading division, personally led by the corps commander\r\nand by Konovnitzin, reached the front about 12.30 p.m., gathered\r\nup Dokhturov’s weary divisions, and the united force stormed\r\nMaloyaroslavetz for the sixth time, driving Broussier and Guilleminot\r\ninto the bridge-head for shelter, until Pino’s Italians sustained and\r\nrallied them. The three divisions beat back the oncoming Russians\r\nand once more gained possession of the awful heap of blood-stained\r\nruins that now represented the town. The conflict was horrible\r\nbeyond description; the opposing soldiery fought to the death amid\r\nconflagration and ruin; the wounded were suffocated, trodden underfoot,\r\nburned alive in the blazing houses, or hideously mangled by the\r\nopposing guns and artillery waggons as they forged their way backward\r\nand forward through the chaos.\r\n\r\nTo repel the three French and Italian divisions Dokhturov was now\r\nobliged to send in Raievski’s second division. Once more the Russian\r\ninfantry poured into the ruins of Maloyaroslavetz, driving their\r\nopponents before them and thrusting them down the slope towards the\r\nbridge. But the head of Davout’s corps was at length arriving, and\r\nEugène accordingly sent in his last reserve, the Royal Guard of Italy.\r\nIts six battalions finally turned the scale against the Russian 6th\r\nand 7th Corps, which, still fighting furiously, were driven back upon\r\nand through the ruins of the town. Davout’s corps artillery forced\r\nthe batteries on the east to retire; the entire artillery of the 4th\r\nCorps was pushed to the front over the dead and dying to support the\r\ninfantry, while Compans’ and Gérard’s divisions crossed a temporary\r\nbridge and took up positions, the former on Eugène’s left, the latter\r\nto his right.\r\n\r\nThe French were masters of the blood-stained ruins of Maloyaroslavetz,\r\nand that was all. While the battle was raging Kutuzov had stationed his\r\nwhole army just south of the town and commenced to entrench himself. He\r\nrelieved the 6th Corps by the 8th and the 3rd Division, and directed\r\nBorozdin and Raievski once more to assault the dreadful ruins of\r\nMaloyaroslavetz. Borozdin’s leading troops entered it, but were driven\r\nout again, and, realising that the French hold was now too firm to be\r\nshaken, the Russians finally withdrew; but their immense artillery\r\ncommanded every exit, and their skirmishers were everywhere close up to\r\nthose of their opponents. The 7th and 8th Corps and the 3rd Division\r\nwere in front line; the 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th with the rest of the 3rd\r\nin second and third, while the powerful cavalry covered both flanks as\r\nfar as the Luzha.\r\n\r\nSo far as a single event can be fixed upon as the decisive point\r\nof Napoleon’s career that event is undoubtedly the battle of\r\nMaloyaroslavetz. Dokhturov’s swift decision, splendidly seconded\r\nby the desperate fighting of the 6th and 7th Corps, had definitely\r\nended all hope of carrying out the retreat with success. It may be\r\ndoubted whether, even by marching by way of Kaluga, the army would\r\nhave succeeded in retaining much discipline and cohesion; but, at\r\nany rate, it would have been the only chance, and now the attempt\r\nhad failed. Napoleon knew it. He established his head-quarters in a\r\npeasant’s hut at Gorodnia, about 5 miles north of Maloyaroslavetz, and\r\nto him in the evening he called Murat, Berthier and Bessières. He was\r\nseated at a table on which was spread a map of the country, and began\r\nto detail the situation to the generals. Suddenly the full extent of\r\nhis imminent ruin seemed to burst upon him, and, dropping his head\r\nupon his hands and his elbows upon the table, he remained for more\r\nthan an hour staring at the map, the comrades of his sixteen years of\r\nvictory waiting for him to speak, silent and mournful. Rising at last\r\nhe dismissed them without further comment, apparently resolved on a\r\nfinal desperate throw of the dice. He sent word to Davout to relieve\r\nEugène’s weary troops at the front, and that he would himself bring up\r\nthe Guard in support. Ney, who had now reached Fominskoië, was ordered\r\nto bring Ledru’s and Razout’s divisions to a point between Borovsk\r\nand Maloyaroslavetz, leaving Claparède and Scheler to guard the vast\r\nassemblage of trains at the former place.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Kutuzov had also been deliberating. He had announced his\r\nintention of standing to fight on the ground which he held; but as\r\nthe hours wore away his resolution failed him. He is not perhaps to\r\nbe blamed; it was no light thing to meet Napoleon--never so dangerous\r\nas when he appeared completely baffled. He knew that the quality of\r\nhis army, diluted with raw militia-men and recruits of a few weeks’\r\ntraining, left much to be desired; another battle like that of Borodino\r\nwould completely cripple it. At any rate, he decided not to accept\r\nbattle where he stood, but to fall back to another position about 3\r\nmiles in rear. This appears to have been strong enough; but it left\r\nuncovered the road from Maloyaroslavetz to Medyn, which Napoleon might\r\nhave used for his retreat. The anger in the Russian army was great.\r\nWilson was furious, and practically accuses Kutuzov of treachery. This\r\nis, of course, absurd. The Russian commander-in-chief and the English\r\ncommissioner were on very bad terms, the latter being apparently rather\r\ntactless and too urgent in his efforts to induce the former to take\r\nthe offensive. There is no question that Kutuzov was too old for his\r\npost; but, after all, he was the responsible chief of the Russian\r\narmies, and he knew, what Wilson did not, the internal condition of his\r\nown. Wild enthusiasm, assisted only by pikes, hardly constitutes\r\na very firm stay against veteran and well-armed warriors led by a\r\ngreat military genius. Nevertheless, it is certain that Wilson and the\r\nbellicose Russian corps commanders were correct. The position behind\r\nMaloyaroslavetz was a better one than that which had been held with\r\nsuch desperate obstinacy at Borodino, and to defend it Kutuzov, after\r\ndeducting the losses on the previous day, had 100,000 regulars and\r\n15,000 irregulars with over 600 guns. Against these Napoleon could\r\nbring only the Guard (less Claparède’s division), the 1st and 4th\r\nCorps, the bulk of the 3rd and the remains of the reserve cavalry.\r\nMortier was on the march from Moscow to Vereia, Junot near Mozhaïsk,\r\nPoniatowski moving westward from Vereia. Allowing for these detachments\r\nNapoleon could place in line of battle by the 27th little more than\r\n80,000 men, including the Head-quarters Guard. He would have 12,000\r\ncavalry, mostly in very bad condition, and about 450 badly horsed\r\nguns as against at least 620 excellently appointed Russian pieces.\r\nThis, however, Kutuzov did not accurately know, while he did know that\r\nNapoleon was in his front with the bulk of his army. He pointed out\r\nthat any reverse would be fatal, since behind the present position was\r\na very difficult defile. To Wilson’s heated expostulations he replied\r\nangrily that he did not intend to win victories of which only England\r\nwould reap the benefit! This outbreak may be charitably attributed to\r\nill-temper at Wilson’s worrying of him. The withdrawal was carried out.\r\nThere was considerable disorder during the passage of the artillery\r\nthrough the defile, but the movement was successfully accomplished,\r\nwell protected by Miloradovich’s skilful handling of the rear-guard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nTHE COUNCIL OF WAR AFTER THE BATTLE OF MALOYAROSLAVETZ\r\n\r\nNapoleon in the peasant’s hut at Gorodnia remained for over an hour\r\ngazing at his map before making the fatal decision to retreat by the\r\ndevastated route to Smolensk]\r\n\r\nDavout in the morning was able to debouch unopposed from\r\nMaloyaroslavetz, but his advance was soon checked by the sight of the\r\nRussian army, now established in its new position. Meanwhile, Napoleon\r\nhad started from Gorodnia. He was attended by his usual escort of\r\nthree or four squadrons. The cavalry of the Guard was some distance\r\nbehind when, on the road to Maloyaroslavetz, a mass of Cossacks poured\r\nout of the woods on the left and raced at the escort. They were riding\r\nin good order, says Rapp, so that it was at first thought that they\r\nwere regulars. They were, in fact, Platov’s own corps, the Ataman\r\nhaving crossed the Luzha early that morning to raid Napoleon’s line of\r\ncommunications. He was now aiming for a park of 40 guns of the Guard\r\nnear Gorodnia. Rapp seized Napoleon’s bridle and turned his horse, and\r\nthe escort formed in haste, Rapp thrusting himself before the Emperor\r\nto shield him from the lances of the wild moss-troopers. His chivalrous\r\ndevotion had wellnigh cost him dear, for his horse was killed, but the\r\nstaff and escort rescued him, and, the cavalry of the Guard coming up,\r\nthe Cossacks dispersed. They seized the artillery park, however, but\r\nthe horses being at a distance watering, only 11 guns could be carried\r\noff. The bold attempt spread alarm through the army, which was almost\r\nall called under arms to resist an expected attack.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, probably greatly exasperated, returned to Gorodnia until\r\nthe way should be safe. At ten o’clock he again started, examined the\r\nbattle-field and then returned to Gorodnia, having practically wasted\r\na whole day--this when every hour was precious. This may have been\r\nbecause he was still undecided as to what he should do. At his quarters\r\nhe held a final and stormy council. Murat, bold to the last, advocated\r\nadvance, and offered to clear a way if the Guard cavalry were added to\r\nthe remnant of his horsemen. Bessières, however, opposed him, observing\r\nthat the transport was already failing and that the advance could not\r\nbe rapid enough to be effective. Davout advised that the Medyn-Smolensk\r\nroad should be adopted as the main line of retreat, but this was\r\nsufficient to provoke the opposition of Murat, who insisted that it was\r\nnot safe from Russian flank attacks. The end was that Napoleon decided\r\nto fall back by the main road to Smolensk, and ordered the whole army\r\nto move on to it by way of Mozhaïsk. The road by Medyn, Yukhnov and\r\nIelnia is about 40 miles shorter than the route adopted; the country\r\nwhich it traversed was not yet entirely devastated, and it is strange\r\nthat Napoleon did not take it, braving the chance of a flank attack by\r\nthe cautious, and by no means confident, Russian commander-in-chief. It\r\nis possible that, whichever route the army might take, it would have\r\nbeen prevented from foraging by the Cossacks. Perhaps also Napoleon\r\nhoped to give Kutuzov the impression that he was retreating upon\r\nVitebsk--as, in fact, he at first did.\r\n\r\nKutuzov was, indeed, so little confident that on the 26th he retreated\r\ntowards Kaluga. His decision has been violently criticised, and not\r\nwithout much show of reason. The only reply is that what we know very\r\nwell to-day was not so plain to Kutuzov in 1812. He did not believe\r\nthat his army was a match for Napoleon’s, and that the correct policy\r\nwas to “play hide and seek” with the invaders, as Clausewitz expresses\r\nit, and so wear them out. Having come to this conclusion, Kutuzov\r\nproceeded to carry out his design regardless of opposition. He was\r\nperhaps wrong, but it cannot be pronounced on the evidence which lay\r\nbefore him at the time that he was. Had Napoleon followed, his army\r\nwould but have been weakened; had he turned westward the Russians would\r\nstill have been on his flank. Wherever he went his line of march would\r\nbe infested by Cossacks. Kutuzov was undoubtedly too cautious; he might\r\nhave risked more, but he might equally have exposed himself to the\r\ncounter-strokes of his mighty antagonist, now driven to desperation,\r\nand have lost everything. His operations were conducted on the basal\r\nidea that Napoleon was not to be beaten by open force, but by steady\r\nevasion and constant harassing. From this point of view his retirement\r\nwas natural. His really serious blunder was committed two days later,\r\nand was the direct outcome of Napoleon’s retreat by Mozhaïsk.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th, while Kutuzov’s exasperated generals were ordering the\r\nretrograde march on Kaluga, Napoleon was commencing the fatal movement\r\nwhich was the beginning of his downfall. The 8th Corps about Mozhaïsk\r\nnaturally formed the advance-guard; Ney was directed on Mozhaïsk from\r\nBorovsk, while the Guard moved back to that place. Mortier was to reach\r\nVereia by the evening, and next day would be rejoined by Roguet’s and\r\nClaparède’s divisions. Eugène was to follow in the track of the Guard,\r\nwhile Davout with the 1st Corps and the relics of the 1st and 3rd\r\nCavalry Corps covered the rear. Poniatowski was to move by cross-roads\r\nto Gzhatsk to cover the left flank. Finally, Evers, who had moved some\r\nway southward towards Yukhnov, was to return to Viasma, and there await\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\nWhile the French army lay about Maloyaroslavetz it had received\r\nrepeated proofs of the activity and audacity of the Russian light\r\ntroops. All the columns had in their turn been alarmed and harassed.\r\nOn the 25th a body of Cossacks executed a _hourra_ (alarm) upon\r\nBorovsk. On the same day Colonel Ilovaïski IX with three regiments of\r\nthem surprised the advance-guard of the 5th Corps, consisting of a\r\nregiment of infantry and two of cavalry under General Tyskiewicz near\r\nKreminskoië, between Vereia and Medyn. Tyskiewicz was captured, and of\r\nhis force of about 1300 men, 500 were killed, wounded and captured.\r\nIlovaïski also took 5 guns.\r\n\r\nIn the actual battle of Maloyaroslavetz the forces engaged were nearly\r\nequal in number. On the French side there were successively sent into\r\nline the 4th Corps and the 3rd and 5th Divisions of the 1st--about\r\n35,000 men in all. The Russians successively engaged about the same\r\nnumbers--Dokhturov’s force, Dorokhov’s detachment, the 7th Corps,\r\nthe 3rd and 27th Divisions, and some regiments of Cossacks. The\r\nRussians admitted a loss of 4412 killed and wounded and 2753 missing.\r\nVery many of the latter, it is to be feared, perished in the burning\r\ntown, and the actual total cannot be reckoned at less than 6000,\r\nquite five-sixths of which fell upon the 20,000 infantry of the 6th\r\nand 7th Corps. A heavy loss was that of General Dorokhov, who, being\r\nsomewhat deaf, miscalculated the distance of musketry fire and was\r\nmortally wounded in consequence. Martinien’s lists show something over\r\n300 officers killed and wounded on the French side, and the total of\r\ncasualties, therefore, would also be about 6000--the vast majority\r\nfalling upon the 4th Corps. Of its four infantry division commanders,\r\nDelzons was killed, and Broussier and Pino were wounded. Two generals\r\nof brigade were killed and three wounded. The losses in the various\r\nCossack alarms were probably slight on both sides. The Russians, as\r\naforesaid, captured 11 guns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE OPERATIONS IN NAPOLEON’S REAR DURING SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of the operations on the Düna and in Volhynia had been that\r\nby the end of August, Wittgenstein was standing on the defensive at\r\nSivokhino faced by a considerably superior force under St. Cyr, while\r\nin Volhynia Tormazov had been driven to cover behind the Styr. He also\r\nwas opposed by forces considerably larger than his own, but Admiral\r\nChichagov was now advancing fast from Moldavia, and within a few weeks\r\nthe scale would be turned heavily against the invaders. On August 28th\r\nthe Tzar and the Crown Prince of Sweden met at Abo. The result was the\r\ntreaty of Abo, which freed Count Steingell’s Russian army of Finland\r\nfor service against Napoleon. Reinforcements to the number of about\r\n15,000 men, of whom 10,000 were St. Petersburg militia, were ordered to\r\njoin Wittgenstein.\r\n\r\nTo co-ordinate the movements of the widely scattered forces which\r\nfrom Finland to Moldavia were converging upon the theatre of war an\r\nelaborate plan of operations was worked out by Alexander and his\r\ncouncil. It was far too detailed, required an impossible exactness of\r\nco-operation from the commanders, and assumed as complete the processes\r\nof reinforcement which had often hardly commenced. In its main lines it\r\nwas as follows:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nMARSHAL GOUVION ST. CYR\r\n\r\nCommander of the 6th (Bavarian) Army Corps and victor of first battle\r\nof Polotsk, Aug. 18th, 1812\r\n\r\nFrom the picture by H. Vernet at Versailles]\r\n\r\nChichagov was to concentrate at Ostrog, in Volhynia, and reach Pinsk by\r\nSeptember 20th. He was to march upon and capture Minsk and then occupy\r\nthe line of the Berezina in conjunction with Wittgenstein, while\r\nTormazov held in check or drove back Schwarzenberg.\r\n\r\nWittgenstein, reinforced by 19,000 militia and 9000 regulars, was to\r\ncross the Düna, supported by Steingell, attack St. Cyr in the rear and,\r\nhaving beaten him, was to push on to co-operate with Chichagov.\r\n\r\nSteingell, with 14,000 men of the army of Finland, was to go to Riga.\r\nThe Riga garrison, 20,000 strong (it was actually much less), was to\r\nattack and contain Macdonald, while under cover of this demonstration\r\nSteingell advanced on Polotsk to co-operate with Wittgenstein. Then,\r\nwhile the latter moved on to effect a junction with Chichagov,\r\nSteingell was to pursue St. Cyr towards Vilna.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ertel’s force at Mozyr was to move northward and join Chichagov\r\nin the neighbourhood of Minsk.\r\n\r\nThe main object of the operations is clearly to bar Napoleon’s homeward\r\nmarch from Moscow by a competent force. But the orders were too minute\r\nin some respects and vague in others. They spoke of such events as\r\nthe defeat of Schwarzenberg by Tormazov as if they were certain to\r\nmaterialise, were clogged with superfluous regulations of detail, and\r\ntook little account of the practical difficulties of organising and\r\nmoving troops in a country like Russia. The strategy in broad outline\r\nwas executed; no more could have been expected.\r\n\r\nThe efforts and intrigues of Andréossy, Napoleon’s Ambassador at\r\nConstantinople, failed to induce the Turks to repudiate the Treaty of\r\nPeace concluded at Bukharest; and thus Admiral Chichagov was, after\r\nlong delays, enabled to start his army for the north. He had under his\r\npersonal command five divisions of all arms commanded respectively\r\nby General Count Langeron, Lieutenant-Generals Voïnov, Essen III and\r\nSabaniev, and Major-General Bulatov. In all there were 50 battalions,\r\n56 squadrons, 17 batteries and 11 regiments of Cossacks. The troops\r\ngenerally were of excellent quality and largely veterans, but the\r\nunits were weak. The total of regulars was perhaps 34,000, with 204\r\nguns; there were also between 3000 and 4000 Cossacks. A division of\r\nabout 6000 men and 12 guns under Major-General Lüders, which had been\r\nsupporting the famous Serb chief, Black George, was following from the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nThe original idea had been that the Army of the Danube should invade\r\nthe French possessions in Illyria; but this was soon abandoned.\r\nChichagov was much disappointed, but to penetrate through wild and\r\nrugged Balkania would have certainly meant the destruction of his army.\r\n\r\nChichagov had been placed in charge of the Russian army of the Danube\r\nand of the peace negotiations with Turkey by the express command of\r\nAlexander, who was angry at the slowness of his predecessor Kutuzov.\r\nThe Admiral was also a strong advocate of the policy of arming the\r\nSerbs against Napoleon and invading Illyria. The Tzar considered him\r\nan able and energetic man, and he certainly should have known, for\r\nChichagov had been for some time Minister of Marine. Wilson, who\r\nvisited him at Bukharest, was much impressed with his ability, and\r\nregretted that he had not been placed earlier in command.\r\n\r\nWilson remarked that the Admiral’s ability might not necessarily be\r\nequal to independent command, but, as a fact, Chichagov did quite as\r\nwell as any of the other Russian generals. His lack of experience made\r\nhim occasionally too slow; but his comments upon the plans submitted to\r\nhim show that he really possessed very sound military judgment. Above\r\nall, he was of a remarkably independent temper, and did not shrink from\r\nexpressing his opinions. He criticised the elaborate Imperial plan of\r\noperations with vigour and acumen, telling the Tzar bluntly that he\r\nshould act as if the orders were more definite than they actually were,\r\nand would answer for his deviations from them!\r\n\r\nChichagov’s position in his own army was not too pleasant. The\r\nmilitary officers were sulky at being commanded by a seaman; his\r\nsecond-in-command, the Frenchman Langeron, was bitterly hostile,\r\nand in his memoirs loses no opportunity of attacking him. Even\r\nLangeron, however, admits his remarkable probity and scorn of personal\r\nprofit--very rare virtues in a Russian of that period--and once or\r\ntwice, despite himself, has to remark upon his chief’s energy.\r\n\r\nChichagov left Bukharest on August 3rd, and on the 9th concentrated\r\nhis army at Fokshani. The weather was very wet, and the result was\r\nthe flooding of the rivers Putna and Sereth beyond Fokshani, which\r\ndestroyed the existing bridges and retarded their re-establishment, so\r\nthat it was not until the 17th that the Army of the Danube was able to\r\nresume its march. The battle of Gorodeczna had been fought; Tormazov\r\nwas in full retreat for the Styr, and soon his anxious messages began\r\nto reach the Admiral, who, in reply, hastened up to the rescue at a\r\npace, considering the difficulties, perhaps never equalled in war. The\r\nweather was hot; the roads were almost non-existent; the army, after\r\nthe bad fashion of Russian forces, was encumbered with immense trains;\r\nnevertheless the speed of its march was remarkable. From the Sereth to\r\nJassy, from Jassy to Choczim and Kamenetz-Podolski, thence for the Styr\r\nby Staroï-Konstantinov and Zaslavl, it took its way, marching rapidly\r\nbut methodically, halting for one day in every six in order to rest and\r\nclose up its straggling columns. Every effort was made to hasten the\r\nmarch, especially after passing the Dniester; weakened infantrymen were\r\ncarried in waggons, while the cavalry and artillery pressed forward\r\nwith all speed. On September 14th, as Miloradovich was withdrawing his\r\nrear-guard from Moscow, Chichagov in person entered Ostrog; and on the\r\nsame day Voïnov’s division reached Krymniki-on-Styr to the support of\r\nTormazov. Langeron was at Dubno, one march behind Voïnov, Essen and\r\nSabaniev at Ostrog, while Bulatov had not yet passed Zaslavl. From\r\nFokshani to the Styr is a distance of over 450 miles, which had been\r\ntraversed by the leading divisions in 29 days, including 5 of rest--a\r\nsustained average of over 15 miles a day and an actual marching average\r\nof 19! The army reached the Styr in excellent order, ready to take the\r\noffensive immediately.\r\n\r\nAt Dubno Chichagov was joined by two infantry regiments from the\r\nCrimea. The united Russian armies now amounted to about 67,000 men,\r\nincluding 18,000 cavalry and Cossacks, with over 300 pieces of\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\nSchwarzenberg had about 42,000 troops under his command, but some\r\nthousands of them were raw Polish levies, and he possessed only 102\r\nguns wherewith to oppose the immense park of his opponents. The marshy\r\nand malarious country was causing much sickness among his troops. Very\r\nlikely also he was withheld by orders from Vienna, and the disaffection\r\namong his subordinates must have counted for much. But, in fact, he\r\nhad not troops sufficient to force the passage of the Styr against an\r\narmy not very inferior to his own in numbers, and much stronger in\r\nartillery. On September 15th, just as Chichagov was closing up to the\r\nfront, he wrote to Berthier and explained his difficulties. On the 17th\r\nhe made a demonstration along the river and became convinced that the\r\nArmy of the Danube had now joined Tormazov.\r\n\r\nChichagov, having relieved Tormazov from fear of being overwhelmed,\r\ncould now allow his troops to move more leisurely. For some days,\r\ntherefore, his divisions were merely quietly ranged along the Styr; and\r\nthe river was bridged. Schwarzenberg, realising that he was about to be\r\nattacked, drew back his detachments and prepared to retreat as soon as\r\nthe Russians moved forward. Early on the 20th Lambert crossed the Styr\r\nand surprised 14 squadrons of German and Polish cavalry, capturing 300\r\nprisoners. On the 22nd the general advance of the Russians began.\r\n\r\nIt is rather characteristic of the Imperial orders that they provided\r\nfor no subordination of one general to another in the combined\r\noperations which they contemplated. In the present instance no\r\ntrouble arose, as Chichagov and Tormazov agreed well together; and\r\nwhen on the 24th orders arrived from Kutuzov for Tormazov to march\r\nto reinforce the main army the latter quietly disregarded it. A few\r\ndays later came another order, this time directing Chichagov to go,\r\nand Tormazov to remain to check Schwarzenberg. The Admiral declined\r\nto abandon his comrade, and comments sarcastically upon these\r\ncontradictory directions. In any case, neither Chichagov nor Tormazov\r\ncould have reached Tarutino in time. At the end of September the\r\nImperial instructions were brought by the Tzar’s aide-de-camp, Colonel\r\nChernishev. Chichagov observes that their object was clearly to range\r\na strong force along the line of the Berezina; and, having despatched\r\nhis outspoken reply to his master, proceeded to attain the end in his\r\nown way. At the same time Tormazov was called by Kutuzov to succeed\r\nBagration, leaving Chichagov in supreme command.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd the Russian armies crossed the Styr, Schwarzenberg’s\r\noutposts falling back before them. Schwarzenberg retired upon Luboml, a\r\nlittle east of the Bug on the Lublin-Kovel road, where he concentrated\r\non the 28th. By the evening of the 29th Chichagov and Tormazov had\r\ncollected most of their forces in his front; but in the night he\r\nevacuated his position and retreated towards Brest-Litovsk, sending\r\nat the same time Siegenthal’s division to Pruzhani. Chichagov pursued\r\nhim with the bulk of his forces, only detaching Voïnov to follow\r\nSiegenthal. On October 9th Chichagov reached Brest-Litovsk and called\r\nin his detachments to give battle; but Schwarzenberg wisely decamped in\r\nthe night and retreated on Warsaw. He took up a position at Wengrow,\r\nabout 42 miles east of Praga, and awaited events, while Siegenthal fell\r\nback to Bielostok. Chichagov, having driven Napoleon’s extreme right\r\nwing across the Bug, halted at Brest-Litovsk with his main body in\r\norder to prepare to carry out the instructions brought by Chernishev.\r\n\r\nThe losses in these operations were not very heavy. There had been a\r\ngood deal of skirmishing, but no general action; and it is unlikely\r\nthat Schwarzenberg’s army lost more than 3000 to 4000 men. The\r\ndiminution in the Russian forces must have been even less.\r\n\r\nChichagov now, according to various critics on both sides, committed a\r\ngreat blunder. He remained halted for 18 days at Brest-Litovsk. But,\r\nas Bogdanovich has justly pointed out, he was about to advance through\r\na country which, never rich, had been devastated by the passage across\r\nit of several armies. He had to divide his army for its new operations,\r\nleaving a competent force to observe Schwarzenberg, and to collect\r\nsupplies sufficient to feed his own corps. Besides, the Army of the\r\nDanube had been marching and fighting for more than two months, and may\r\nwell have needed time wherein to repose and refit.\r\n\r\nDuring the halt at Brest-Litovsk General Sacken joined the army from\r\nthe south, bringing with him about 4000 depôt troops, who appear to\r\nhave been drafted into the weaker units.\r\n\r\nWhile the Admiral himself remained at Brest, preparing for the march\r\nto the Berezina, he sent out detachments to overrun Warsaw and sweep\r\nthe country towards Minsk. The detachments sent towards Warsaw were\r\nsupported by Essen III’s division, which, on October 18th, came in\r\ncontact at Biala with Reynier and was driven back, with a loss of\r\nseveral hundred men and a gun, upon Brest-Litovsk. On the other hand,\r\nGeneral Chaplitz on the 20th destroyed the new Lithuanian regiment of\r\nNapoleon’s Guard at Slonim, only about 120 men escaping out of 600.\r\nChaplitz’s detachment was supported by Cherbatov’s (formerly Markov’s)\r\ndivision. Eastward of Slonim there were very few invading troops to\r\ncover the long line of communications, threatened on the south by\r\nRussian forces at Bobruisk and Mozyr. The garrison of Bobruisk was\r\nnot strong enough to make effective sorties, but the force at Mozyr\r\nhad been gradually increased to about 12,000 men and over 30 guns.\r\nTo guard against the menace of this force and to observe Bobruisk,\r\nDombrowski’s infantry division and three regiments of cavalry had been\r\nleft by Poniatowski in August. Dombrowski’s whole force, even after\r\nthe junction of some Lithuanian levies, can never have exceeded 9000\r\nmen, and was barely sufficient, after garrisoning Mohilev, to observe\r\nBobruisk, much less to oppose any effectual resistance to Ertel. On\r\nSeptember 11th a column from Mozyr forced an Austrian detachment\r\nto abandon Pinsk, while a second, under Ertel himself, defeated\r\nDombrowski’s Lithuanians on the 15th and threw some reinforcements into\r\nBobruisk. Then, however, he retired to Mozyr.\r\n\r\nFrom Riga on August 7th Essen again made a sortie and captured Schlock,\r\nwhich was then retaken by the Prussians. On the 23rd Essen decided\r\nto make a general attack upon the Prussians, who lay observing the\r\ncity, extended from Schlock to Thomsdorf on the Düna, a distance of 42\r\nmiles. A column under Lewis was to make the real attack upon Eckau,\r\nwhile a detachment under Major-General Veliaminov demonstrated towards\r\nMitau, and Rear-Admiral von Müller with a flotilla of sloops attacked\r\nSchlock. The Prussian posts at Dahlenkirchen on the Düna were driven\r\nback, with some loss, by Lewis, but Veliaminov’s demonstration had\r\nno results, though von Müller captured Schlock. On the 26th Grawert,\r\nhaving collected his scattered detachments, drove Lewis back into Riga;\r\nand Schlock and Dahlenkirchen were reoccupied. The losses in these\r\nactions, combined with sickness, considerably weakened the garrison. On\r\nthe other hand, they proved that the Prussians were not strong enough\r\neven to blockade the place. Macdonald sent a brigade of Grandjean’s\r\ndivision to reinforce them, and prepared to bring up the rest of it at\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nAfter this both sides lay inactive until September 18th, when there was\r\nsome more indecisive skirmishing about Schlock. The Prussians were now\r\ncommanded by Lieutenant-General Yorck, Grawert being invalided. Between\r\nthe 20th and 22nd, Count Steingell’s corps from Finland, which had\r\nlanded at Revel on the 10th, entered Riga. It had sustained some losses\r\nby shipwreck, and part of the troops were detained by contrary winds,\r\nso that Steingell had with him only a little over 10,000 men and 18\r\nguns. Nevertheless, the force in Riga was now over 20,000 strong, and\r\nan attempt could be made to execute the Tzar’s orders.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th accordingly Steingell with his own troops and a division\r\nunder Lewis moved out upon Dahlenkirchen. It was easily occupied, and\r\non the 27th Steingell advanced upon Eckau, where Yorck had collected\r\nseveral regiments. His superiority in artillery enabled him to hold\r\nSteingell in check until the arrival of Lewis, when he retired behind\r\nthe Aa, abandoning Bausk.\r\n\r\nWhile Steingell was pushing back Yorck, Essen directed a column of 2000\r\nmen and 6 guns upon Mitau from Riga, while a flotilla came up the Aa.\r\nEssen’s hope was to destroy the siege train, which, however, was not\r\nthere. He ordered Steingell to support the advance with 3000 men and 6\r\nguns, under Colonel Ekeln. On the 28th Yorck, being not yet joined by\r\nHunerbein’s brigade (Grandjean’s division), ordered General Kleist to\r\nabandon Mitau and come to reinforce him. This Kleist did, and on the\r\n29th the Russians occupied the place without opposition. But meanwhile\r\nYorck, reinforced by Kleist and Hunerbein, took the offensive against\r\nSteingell’s weakened force and began to drive it back. There was some\r\nnot very vigorous fighting along the Aa, as the result of which the\r\nPrussians gained a foothold on the farther bank.\r\n\r\nHunerbein, coming from the right, had retaken Bausk, and on the 30th\r\nYorck made a general advance, driving Steingell back all along the\r\nline. The fighting was not at all severe, Steingell merely gave way\r\ndeliberately before the advance of Yorck’s now superior columns. On the\r\nother hand, Yorck was probably not anxious to do more than his strict\r\nmilitary duty required. Steingell retired towards Riga with no serious\r\nloss and re-entered the lines on the 2nd of October, Essen at the same\r\ntime evacuating Mitau. The losses on neither side were heavy.\r\n\r\nThe result of the action was that Macdonald decided to come himself to\r\nthe support of Yorck. Leaving a Polish regiment in Dünaburg he marched\r\nfor Mitau with the rest of Grandjean’s division, but when he arrived\r\nthe Russians had retreated into Riga. The Marshal increased Hunerbein’s\r\nbrigade to 8 battalions, rearranged the positions of the troops, and\r\nsent Grandjean with one brigade back to Illuxt, near Dünaburg. To\r\ndraw closer to Riga with his feeble forces was evidently impossible,\r\nand week after week wore itself away without any fighting except some\r\noccasional skirmishing at the outposts.\r\n\r\nAfter his victory at Polotsk, on August 18th, St. Cyr had been\r\nunable to follow in pursuit of Wittgenstein owing to his weakness\r\nin cavalry fit for the purpose. Wittgenstein therefore was able to\r\nwithdraw unmolested behind the Drissa. On the 22nd Wrede made a strong\r\nreconnaissance towards Sivokhino, but the Bavarians were repulsed by a\r\ndetachment under Colonel Vlastov with a loss of about 300 killed and\r\nwounded and 150 prisoners.\r\n\r\nBoth sides now settled down into cantonments. Both had suffered very\r\nseverely and neither was in a state to resume hostilities. Wittgenstein\r\nentrenched his position at Sivokhino, and his cavalry were able to\r\ncircumscribe the French foraging operations on the right bank of\r\nthe Düna. Wittgenstein also fortified his advanced base of Sebezh.\r\nMeanwhile, St. Cyr threw up entrenchments round Polotsk. The troops\r\nwere distributed around the town, and, being largely in quarters or\r\nin barracks and tolerably well supplied, were soon in good condition.\r\nThe effectives were increased by drafts and convalescents, but it is\r\ndoubtful whether there was any great rise in the numbers owing to the\r\ndiminution occasioned by constant petty skirmishing. The Bavarians were\r\napparently unable to recover from the blighting effects of the sickness\r\nplanted in their midst by their terrible hardships in July, and, though\r\nthey were at rest and better supplied than they had hitherto been,\r\ntheir numbers continued to diminish. Maret and Hogendorp did their\r\nbest to forward supplies from Vilna, but bread was often scarce and\r\nalready, on October 7th, St. Cyr was writing to express his anxiety\r\nat the difficulty of procuring forage. The numerical strength of St.\r\nCyr’s force by the middle of October appears to have been about 30,000\r\nmen--2nd Corps 21,000; Doumerc about 2200; 6th Corps perhaps 7000 or\r\n8000.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Marshal Victor, having crossed the Niemen on September 4th,\r\nreached Smolensk on the 27th. On October 6th Napoleon gave him his\r\ninstructions. Besides his corps and the Saxon and Westphalian brigades\r\nof Löw and Coutard he was given control of Dombrowski’s division. He\r\nwas informed that he was to act as the general reserve of the _Grande\r\nArmée_, and would move to support either Schwarzenberg, St. Cyr, or\r\nNapoleon, according to circumstances. Napoleon greatly underestimated\r\nthe pressure on his flanks. He says in the despatch that Chichagov is\r\nonly 20,000 strong, that his junction with Tormazov will only raise his\r\nforce to 40,000, and that Schwarzenberg can easily deal with him. As a\r\nfact, both Schwarzenberg and St. Cyr were opposed by greatly superior\r\nnumbers. Even when the former had been joined by his reinforcements he\r\nwas still outnumbered by Chichagov, who might be further strengthened\r\nby Ertel from Mozyr. On the north Wittgenstein and Steingell had\r\n50,000 men against St. Cyr’s 30,000. To afford adequate support to the\r\nwings Victor would have needed 80,000 men.\r\n\r\nA few words must here be said upon the diplomatic situation. Prussia,\r\ntrodden into the dust by Napoleon’s iron heel, was in the last stages\r\nof destitution, while Austria, though sorely humiliated, was still\r\nindependent, far less wasted, and, in addition, was more or less\r\nafraid of a revival of Prussia. These circumstances are reflected in\r\nthe despatches of the Prime Ministers, the Prussian, Hardenberg, being\r\neager to take vigorous steps and inclined to believe in the rumours\r\nof French defeats; while Metternich is pessimistic and obviously\r\nplaying for his own--or Austria’s--hand. He seems after the fall of\r\nMoscow to have considered that Napoleon might win, and accordingly\r\na reinforcement of about 5000 men was despatched to Schwarzenberg.\r\nOtherwise there were signs that Napoleon’s vassals were beginning to\r\nfalter at the never-ending drain of human life. Bavaria and Württemberg\r\nsent drafts to refill the wasted ranks of their contingents; but the\r\nKing of Württemberg spoke of his uneasiness at receiving no news. The\r\nGrand Duke of Baden professed himself unable to add to his treaty\r\ncontingent. In his growing anxiety Napoleon actually went to the length\r\nof politely asking the King of Prussia to replace two weakened cavalry\r\nregiments. He also directed that every reinforcement despatched was to\r\nbe stated in all newspapers at double its strength, so as to impose\r\nupon the Russians should the tidings reach them!\r\n\r\nAfter the failure of the sortie from Riga Count Steingell made up his\r\nmind to waste no more time in attempting to execute the official plan\r\nof operations, but to join Wittgenstein without delay. On October 5th\r\nhe left Riga, and proceeded by forced marches up the right bank of the\r\nDüna. On the 15th he reached Druia, having marched over 180 miles in\r\nten days.\r\n\r\nOn October 10th Wittgenstein’s first column of reinforcement, over\r\n5000 strong, arrived at Sivokhino. On the same day the 9000 men of the\r\nsecond column reached Nevel, and on the 14th its junction with the main\r\nforce was practically complete. Wittgenstein had now under his hand\r\nabout 40,000 men, including 5000 cavalry and Cossacks, with 154 guns.\r\n\r\nWittgenstein distributed the militia battalions among the infantry,\r\none to each regiment, and his staff issued special orders as to how\r\nthese enthusiastic but raw troops were to act in battle. The effect was\r\nexcellent; and though the men were imperfectly clothed and equipped,\r\nand almost untrained, they rapidly gained efficiency and cohesion.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate effect of the elaborate and too minute Imperial plan\r\nof operations now became evident. Steingell had acted upon his own\r\njudgment in marching to reinforce Wittgenstein; but he felt himself\r\nobliged to act upon his master’s orders as far as possible, and so\r\ncrossed the Düna at Druia to operate on the left bank. He was thus\r\ncompletely separated from Wittgenstein, and the latter could only\r\nendeavour to remedy the strategic defect by bridging the river nearer\r\nPolotsk. As he had no pontoons the operation was likely to prove a\r\nlengthy one. He ordered his chief of engineers, Colonel Count Sievers,\r\nto construct a bridge at Desna, detailing as his escort 4 battalions of\r\ninfantry and a regiment of cavalry--2500 men and 4 guns.\r\n\r\nSo far as there was any concerted plan of operations on the part of\r\nthe Russian commanders, it appears to have been that Wittgenstein was\r\nto attack Polotsk and Steingell to cut off St. Cyr’s retreat. It was\r\nclear that the French general might choose to hold Polotsk merely by\r\na rear-guard, and destroy Steingell’s small force by concentrating\r\nupon him the bulk of his own army. To obviate this, Wittgenstein must\r\nattack Polotsk speedily and vigorously. Even so the outlook was not\r\naltogether promising. Polotsk was fortified; and St. Cyr was quite\r\nstrong enough to hold it against the 37,000 men of whom Wittgenstein\r\ndisposed after deducting Sievers’ detachment.\r\n\r\nWittgenstein distributed his numerically strong but rather incoherent\r\nforce into three large divisions of all arms, commanded respectively\r\nby Lieutenant-Generals Prince Iachvil and Berg and Major-General\r\nBeguichev, besides a flank detachment under Major-General Alexiev. On\r\nthe 16th he began his march upon Polotsk, while Steingell was moving\r\nfrom Druia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCOUNT WITTGENSTEIN\r\n\r\nCommander of the 1st Russian Army Corps in 1812]\r\n\r\nSt. Cyr did not believe that he could hold his own unaided against the\r\nunited Russian forces; but determined to defend Polotsk if Wittgenstein\r\nshould dash his head against its entrenchments. He detached Corbineau\r\nwith his cavalry brigade and three weak Bavarian battalions to observe\r\nSteingell, passed his trains, escorted by Doumerc and Castex, across\r\nto the left bank of the Düna and posted the rest of his forces in the\r\nentrenchments which he had caused to be thrown up. Polotsk itself was\r\ncovered by a palisaded parapet. Across the western part of the town a\r\nsecond palisaded parapet had been carried from the Polota to the Düna,\r\ncovering the two bridges of rafts which had been thrown across the\r\nriver. On the western bank of the Polota, north-west of the town were\r\nthree redoubts, and to the north the Roman Catholic cemetery had been\r\nentrenched. On the east of the Polota the exterior chain of defence\r\nwas less complete. Three redoubts and an outlying battery were under\r\nconstruction, but not yet finished. Below the town batteries had been\r\nthrown up to flank the entrenchments on the western side. The passage\r\nof the Polota had been rendered as difficult as might be, and at the\r\nvillage of Struria above Polotsk the ground near the river had been\r\nflooded by damming up a brook.\r\n\r\nMerle’s division held the entrenched western side of the town, and the\r\nfirst of the Polota redoubts. Wrede’s Bavarians defended Nos. 2 and\r\n3, the cemetery, Spas, and the line of the Polota. On the east side of\r\nthe Polota stood Legrand, while Maison continued the line to the Düna.\r\nOn the right flank were four squadrons of cavalry, all that St. Cyr had\r\nretained. Struria was occupied by a detachment of Bavarians.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th Steingell had not yet reached Desna; the bridge was\r\nscarcely commenced; and Wittgenstein decided to assault St. Cyr’s\r\nposition. He rightly directed the weight of his attack upon the French\r\nright and right centre, where the entrenchments were still incomplete.\r\nPrince Iachvil was ordered to contain Merle and Wrede, while Berg and\r\nBeguichev assailed Legrand and Maison.\r\n\r\nThe French outposts were driven back by the advance of the Russians;\r\nbut when Berg and Beguichev assailed the main French line they could\r\nmake little headway. The combat swayed backward and forward; the\r\nRussian militia behaved with splendid bravery; but the French troops,\r\naided by their entrenchments, everywhere held their ground; the single\r\nredoubt carried by the Russians could not be held in the face of the\r\nfurious fire poured into it from the entrenchments before Polotsk.\r\nWittgenstein apparently lost his head; and though he had at first,\r\naccording to Russian authorities, merely intended a demonstration, he\r\nhad by the evening employed nearly the whole of Berg’s and Beguichev’s\r\ndivisions in vain attempts to force the French right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECOND BATTLE OF POLOTSK\r\n\r\nOctober 18th-19th, 1812]\r\n\r\nAbout 4 p.m., apparently on the hypothesis that St. Cyr had weakened\r\nhis left to withstand the attack on his right, Wittgenstein ordered\r\nIachvil to assault in earnest the western works. The attempt was\r\nhopeless, and could not for a moment have succeeded. Such advantage as\r\nthe Russians gained was due to a rash counter-attack made by a Swiss\r\nregiment and a battalion of Croats. They suffered very heavily and were\r\ndriven back upon the works, the Croats being mostly captured. But this\r\nwas all that Iachvil could achieve, though his militia fought with\r\nfanatic fury. At nightfall St. Cyr’s position was practically intact;\r\nand the Russians had certainly lost far more heavily than the French.\r\nWhile the battle was proceeding, Steingell was approaching by the left\r\nbank of the Düna, but was only able to reach the Uchach, 7 or 8 miles\r\nwest of Polotsk, by the evening of the 18th with his advance-guard. De\r\nChambray criticises him for his slowness; but as he only crossed the\r\nDüna on the 16th, and then had nearly 50 miles of bad road to traverse\r\nin order to reach Polotsk, the stricture appears unjust. On the 19th\r\nSteingell informed Wittgenstein that he was at hand. The bridge at\r\nDesna was hardly commenced, and had St. Cyr been a little stronger\r\nthe position of the Russians would have been even more serious than\r\nit was. Wittgenstein’s army had obviously been badly shaken by the\r\nfierce fighting of the day before; for he made no attempt to renew the\r\nattack until Steingell could join in from the south. This threw an\r\nawkward responsibility upon the commander of the weak Finland corps,\r\nand exposed him to the risk of destruction should St. Cyr decide to\r\nhold Polotsk only as a _tête de pont_ and concentrate a superior force\r\non the left bank of the Düna. To the writer it seems that St. Cyr might\r\nhave abandoned his outlying works, and left the inner and continuous\r\nline to be held by about 14,000 men, while with the remaining 14,000\r\n(allowing for losses) he attacked and defeated Steingell, who had\r\nscarcely 10,000 actually in hand. This, however, he did not do; and as\r\nthe precise strength of the entrenchments is a matter of doubt he was\r\nperhaps right. He detached one regiment from each of his divisions,\r\nand sent them under General Amey to reinforce Corbineau. A Cuirassier\r\nregiment was also directed to the Uchach. Steingell’s advance-guard,\r\nonly four battalions under Colonel Turshaninov, naturally halted\r\nbefore this accumulation of force and waited for the main body, while\r\nSteingell apparently was listening for the sound of Wittgenstein’s guns\r\nbefore advancing on Polotsk. The French containing force took up a\r\nfairly strong position among woods and broken ground, and effectually\r\nchecked the advance of the Finland corps. St. Cyr, however, made up his\r\nmind that he was not strong enough to contend at the same time with\r\nboth Russian forces, and in the evening began to evacuate Polotsk.\r\nIachvil noted the withdrawal of troops and opened fire on his front,\r\nthe Russian centre and left taking up the ball. The Russians were too\r\nlate to molest the evacuation of the outer works, but they pushed\r\nforward against the inner line round the town. The houses everywhere\r\ntook fire, partly ignited by the Russian howitzers, partly, as it\r\nwould seem, burned by the French to clear the front of some of their\r\nworks, which would otherwise have been masked. The Russian infantry\r\nattacks were everywhere repulsed; and during the evening Legrand’s\r\nand Maison’s divisions and the Bavarians defiled through the town and\r\ncrossed the bridge, covered by Merle’s Swiss and Croats. At midnight\r\nthe Russians entered Polotsk; but the battle was far from its end.\r\nMerle and his gallant regiments disputed every inch of the streets\r\nwith splendid valour, repeatedly repulsing the headlong charges of the\r\nRussian infantry. By 2.30 p.m. the whole French army was safe on the\r\nleft bank of the Düna, and the bridges were destroyed. St. Cyr, as he\r\ndirected the battle, was severely wounded in the foot, and disabled\r\nfor the rest of the campaign. He had perhaps committed an error in not\r\nmerely holding the inner works at Polotsk and thus concentrating a\r\nsuperior force on Steingell; but the steady and successful retreat did\r\nhim much honour. It seems clear that he was throughout master of his\r\noperations; and that Wittgenstein could only press the withdrawal very\r\nslightly. The honours of the fighting rested chiefly with the gallant\r\nSwiss regiments of Merle’s division, whose conduct in the rear-guard\r\nwas truly admirable.\r\n\r\nSt. Cyr being now for the moment in safety, reinforced the force\r\nfacing Steingell with another French regiment and placed Wrede in\r\ncommand. At 4.30 a.m. on the 20th he fell unexpectedly upon Steingell,\r\nwhose advance-guard, surprised in its bivouacs, was seized with a panic\r\nand dispersed. Buturlin says that 1800 men of 2 regiments of Chasseurs\r\nwere captured, but as this would appear to be almost their whole\r\nstrength, and they figure later as at least 2 battalions strong, this\r\nis doubtless an exaggeration. Steingell’s main body was not closely\r\nsupporting the unlucky vanguard, and on its dispersal he hastily\r\ncollected the remainder of his troops and retreated on Desna, where he\r\ncrossed the Düna, while Wrede, having disposed of him, rejoined the\r\nmain body of the French army. Besides St. Cyr, Legrand, the senior\r\ndivisional commander, was wounded, and the temporary charge of the 2nd\r\nand 6th Corps devolved upon Merle. On the 21st he finally retreated\r\nfrom before Polotsk. Wittgenstein, hampered by lack of engineers and\r\nbridging material, could not establish a passage over the Düna until\r\nthe 23rd. Only a detachment of cavalry under Colonel Rüdiger forded the\r\nriver and skirmished with Merle’s outposts. To make the best of things\r\nWittgenstein detached a division of all arms under General Sazonov to\r\nDesna to reinforce Steingell. The latter thereupon on the 23rd repassed\r\nthe Düna, detached Major-General Vlastov with a force of 8 regular\r\nbattalions, 1 militia battalion, 3 squadrons of Hussars, a regiment\r\nof Cossacks and 12 guns--about 5000 men in all--to observe Dünaburg,\r\nand with the rest of his force moved once more up the left bank of the\r\nriver. On the same day Wittgenstein completed a bridge at Polotsk and\r\nbegan to cross. He had just been joined by two battalions of Novgorod\r\nmilitia, which he left with another militia battalion, 2 batteries,\r\na detachment of regulars and some cavalry and Cossacks to garrison\r\nPolotsk.\r\n\r\nMerle retreated from before Polotsk in 3 columns, Legrand’s division\r\nmoving on Bechenkowiczi, Wrede, with the remains of the 6th Corps\r\nand Corbineau’s cavalry, on Glubokoië to cover the road to Vilna, the\r\nremainder of the 2nd Corps and Doumerc’s Cuirassiers on Chasniki by way\r\nof Uchach and Lepel.\r\n\r\nMartinien’s lists, probably not quite complete, show 238 officers of\r\nthe 3 “combatant” arms, almost all of the 2nd Corps, killed and wounded\r\nduring the three days’ fighting round Polotsk. The French loss would\r\ntherefore have been in the region of 5000. The number of unwounded\r\nprisoners was apparently about 1000. The French lost also 1 gun. The\r\nRussians only admit a loss of 3000 killed and wounded, but, seeing\r\nthe character of the fighting, and that the French were acting on the\r\ndefensive and covered by entrenchments, this estimate is certainly far\r\ntoo low. Probably, allowing for Steingell’s losses, 8000 would not be\r\ntoo low a figure. Among the wounded were Major-Generals Balk, Hammen\r\nand the Prince of Siberia; and Privy Councillor Bibikov and Chamberlain\r\nMordvinov, who commanded militia battalions.\r\n\r\nMarshal Victor cannot long have had Napoleon’s instructions in his\r\nhands when he was called upon to act upon them. On reaching Smolensk\r\nhe cantoned his corps between that place and Orsha. His troops\r\nappear to have maintained good discipline; and a commencement was\r\nmade of establishing order in the vicinity. Some officers, at least,\r\nsucceeded in instilling confidence into the villagers and obtaining\r\nsupplies by regular methods; and more might have been done had the\r\n9th Corps remained longer in the district. Upon learning from St.\r\nCyr of the large reinforcements which were joining Wittgenstein,\r\nVictor sent Dändels’ German division to Vitebsk, and four battalions\r\nto Bechenkowiczi to watch the line of the Düna. Then he heard of the\r\nabandonment of Polotsk; and it was clear that he must assist the\r\novermatched army of St. Cyr. He accordingly directed Dändels upon\r\nBechenkowiczi; and with the rest of his corps moved towards Chasniki.\r\n\r\nThe result of the operations about Polotsk therefore had been that\r\nthe French had been forced to abandon the line of the Düna, and that\r\nto sustain them Napoleon’s sole powerful reserve had to be diverted\r\nto sustain the retreating 2nd and 6th Corps. Only the small force\r\nat Smolensk was now available to reinforce the retreating army of\r\nthe centre; and there was hardly anything to oppose the advance of\r\nChichagov on the Berezina. On October 25th Napoleon was 70 miles\r\nsouth-west of Moscow, just about to retreat on Smolensk, with the Grand\r\nArmy of Russia on his left flank able to reach his goal before him.\r\nWittgenstein was advancing from the Düna towards the Berezina, but was\r\nfaced by an equal or superior force, and might be kept from the main\r\nline of communications. Chichagov was at Brest-Litovsk, ready to march\r\non Minsk, with nothing in his front but feeble detachments.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the last days of October, the focus of operations became\r\nthe Berezina near Borisov. Upon it were converging: (1) Napoleon,\r\nnearly 400 miles distant, with an equal or superior enemy attending him\r\non the flank and able to reach Smolensk before him; (2) Wittgenstein,\r\n90 miles away, with an equal French force in his front; (3) Chichagov,\r\n262 miles distant, with hardly anything to oppose him. Schwarzenberg\r\nwas in rear of Chichagov, and watched by a force at least able to\r\nseriously hamper any attempt at pursuit made by him. So the curtain\r\nrose upon the last act of the great tragedy, as from every side\r\nNapoleon’s armies and those of his enemies set their faces towards\r\nthe Berezina, soon to acquire a terrible renown in the history of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH RETREAT. MALOYAROSLAVETZ TO ORSHA\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 26th the French retreat by the Moscow-Smolensk road\r\ndefinitely commenced. Napoleon with the Guard and 4th Corps moved\r\nback to Borovsk. Ney was directed by Vereia on Mozhaïsk, while Davout\r\nwith the 1st Corps and the relics of the 1st and 3rd Cavalry Corps\r\nremained near Maloyaroslavetz until the evening. And, while Napoleon\r\nwas retracing his steps, Kutuzov, also, was retreating upon Kaluga.\r\nHe apparently feared that the French, having the road open, would\r\nmove westward to Medyn and thence south-eastward upon Kaluga. This\r\nhypothesis is a direct reflection upon his action in abandoning\r\nhis position outside Maloyaroslavetz. As matters stood, Kutuzov’s\r\ninference was not unreasonable; Poniatowski’s corps was actually on\r\nthe march from Vereia to Medyn, and appeared to be the advance-guard\r\nof a turning movement. Miloradovich remained in observation on the\r\noriginal Russian position, and Platov continued to hover about\r\nDavout’s corps. The _Corps de Bataille_ retrograded to Gonsherevo,\r\nabout 12 miles from Kaluga. Paskievich’s division was sent to bar the\r\nMedyn-Kaluga road at Adamovskoë, some miles to the westward. There he\r\nwas joined by Ilovaïski IX and his Cossack detachment. Miloradovich\r\nwas about to fall back on the Russian main body when it was discovered\r\nthat Maloyaroslavetz was evacuated. Kutuzov was informed, and the\r\nadvance-guard reoccupied the line of the Luzha.\r\n\r\nKutuzov appeared to have inferred that Napoleon’s intention was to\r\nretreat upon Smolensk--as, in fact, it was. He accordingly directed\r\nhis main body upon Adamovskoë, evidently with the purpose of following\r\non the flank of the French retreat, while Miloradovich was ordered to\r\nMedyn. The latter, however, disquieted by reports that the French army\r\nwas moving from Borovsk by cross-roads upon Medyn, hesitated, delayed,\r\nand finally also moved to Adamovskoë. Kutuzov remained at the latter\r\nplace during the 29th, endeavouring to envisage the situation, and\r\nfinally appears to have decided that the _Grande Armée_ was retreating\r\non Vitebsk. The conclusion was reasonable enough. The march of the\r\nFrench along the Borovsk-Mozhaïsk road might certainly indicate an\r\nintention to cross the Smolensk road at Mozhaïsk and take a route\r\nto the northward for Vitebsk--as Jomini considers that they should\r\nhave done. Consequently upon the 30th Kutuzov marched northwards upon\r\nMozhaïsk. Platov with his Cossacks and Paskievich’s division was to\r\nfollow the French rear-guard. The advance-guard would move parallel\r\nwith the French left flank, while the _Corps de Bataille_ kept to the\r\nleft of the advance-guard, generally at about a day’s march distance.\r\nOn the 30th the main army had reached Kremenskoë, but by that day the\r\nFrench rear-guard had arrived at Mozhaïsk and all the corps were moving\r\nalong the highway to Smolensk. Kutuzov and Miloradovich therefore\r\nturned to the westward, while Platov and Paskievich harassed Davout.\r\n\r\nThe result, therefore, was that the French army had at the outset\r\ngained a start upon their pursuers. Bennigsen says that he advised\r\nthat the march should be directed from Adamovskoë on Yukhnov, thence\r\nby a broad road to Slavkovo. It seems clear that this direction would\r\nhave been an excellent one. But Kutuzov knew that Napoleon was free to\r\nuse the Medyn road, and indeed expected him to do so. He had, however,\r\nfallen back by Vereia, a direction which rather indicated an intention\r\nof retreating upon Vitebsk. If he had hoped by taking this route to\r\ndeceive the Russians as to his line of march he had certainly succeeded.\r\n\r\nFrom Mozhaïsk to Viasma the Moscow-Smolensk road proceeds generally\r\nin a shallow arc of a circle, often describing a very sinuous course.\r\nMiloradovich marched steadily to the south of it, gradually closing in,\r\nand moving much faster than the already dwindling and straggling French\r\narmy with its immense trains. Still farther to the south and far to the\r\nrear the Russian _Corps de Bataille_ had turned in the right direction\r\nand was also marching for Viasma. The roads by which it was forced to\r\nproceed were wretched, but none the less the troops marched at a very\r\ncreditable pace, covering some 74 miles in 4 days.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Napoleonic host was making its way into and along the\r\nMoscow-Smolensk high-road. Junot’s corps being actually on it when\r\nthe retreat from Maloyaroslavetz began of course led the way; behind\r\nit came in succession the Guard, the 2nd and 4th Cavalry Corps, and\r\nthe 3rd, 4th, and 1st _Corps d’Armée_, while Poniatowski covered\r\nthe left flank. At Vereia, on the 27th, Mortier rejoined, bringing\r\nwith him his prisoner, Winzingerode. Napoleon treated the general\r\nwith gross insolence and brutality, overwhelming him with abuse, and\r\nactually condemned him to death as a traitor because he was a German\r\nand therefore a subject of one of his vassals! It is difficult to say\r\nwhether he was or was not in earnest. When he was enraged his manners\r\nwere brutal beyond words; and at this time he had every cause for being\r\nexasperated. In any case, he gave way to the remonstrances of Berthier\r\nand Murat. His conduct was otherwise inexcusable. Winzingerode had\r\nentered the service of Russia previous to the formation of the Rhine\r\nConfederacy. After being kept in suspense for some days Winzingerode\r\nwas sent in custody to France; but he was rescued in Lithuania by\r\nCossacks, as we shall have occasion to mention.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th Napoleon, at Mozhaïsk, received a report from Davout that\r\nhe had as yet seen no enemies but Cossacks. He thereupon inferred that\r\nthe main Russian army was marching to cut his line of retreat. Its\r\nnatural objective would in that case be Viasma, and the Emperor decided\r\nto push for that place with all speed with the Guard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nARMED RUSSIAN PEASANTS IN AMBUSH IN THE WOODS WAITING TO CUT OFF FRENCH\r\nSTRAGGLERS\r\n\r\nFrom the picture by Verestchagin]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 28th Davout was near Vereia. He reported that\r\nthe Russians were already showing infantry--these were of course\r\nPaskievich’s division. He begged the Emperor to put a stop to the\r\nwholesale burning of villages by the corps ahead of him. Demoralisation\r\nwas spreading fast, and the men were abandoning the ranks in crowds.\r\nThe usual straggling array of march of the Napoleonic hosts was a bad\r\npreparation for a retreat in face of an enemy. The field of Borodino\r\nwas crossed by the Guard at daybreak on the 29th. It still presented\r\na fearful spectacle. Junot’s men had been unable to bury many even of\r\nthe French dead; and the ground was strewn with rotting corpses mingled\r\nwith the wreckage of the terrible struggle. The hospitals at Kolotskoï\r\nand elsewhere were mere charnel-houses in which the dead lay heaped\r\nwith the living, amid pestilence, filth, and destitution. About 1500\r\nunhappy creatures still remained, Junot having been unable to remove\r\nthem. Napoleon issued an order that every private carriage or other\r\nnon-military vehicle was to carry one or two. Its effect was simply to\r\nhasten the end of the unfortunate invalids, who were so much additional\r\nencumbrance to men already beginning to feel the pinch of want. They\r\nwere abandoned by the drivers at the earliest opportunity: some\r\napparently were murdered outright; not one, probably, lived to reach\r\nSmolensk. Food was becoming scarce. As far as Mozhaïsk the country was\r\nnot entirely devastated, and the leading troops had been able to feed\r\ntheir horses; but there was nothing for the rear-guard, whose plight\r\nwas rendered all the worse by the reckless destruction of shelter by\r\nthe corps ahead of them. After Mozhaïsk the wasted countryside afforded\r\nlittle or no forage; the horses, already exhausted and over-worked,\r\nwere reduced to such substitutes for fodder as thatch and autumn\r\nleaves, and died by hundreds every day. The destruction of the means of\r\ntransport meant the loss of much of the already too scanty supply of\r\nfood. When it was not lost outright it was pillaged by the stragglers\r\nand simply served to keep alive these useless beings, while better\r\nand braver men died of starvation. By November 3rd such supplies as\r\nhad been brought were almost entirely exhausted; the only resource of\r\nthe starving horde was the flesh of the horses which were continually\r\nbreaking down. The officers, of course, and the head-quarters, were\r\nbetter provided; and some of the men had still remains of their\r\nplunder, but these were the exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe weather was still fine, but it was steadily growing colder, and\r\nthe half-famished men, ill-clothed, ill-shod, weary with marching,\r\nobtained little rest in their chilly bivouacs, and became day by day\r\nless able to endure their trials. Those who left the line of march were\r\ncommonly slaughtered or captured. Capture was often the same thing as\r\nlingering death. The peasants, naturally half barbarous, and maddened\r\nby the excesses of the invaders, showed little mercy. Sir Robert Wilson\r\ntells from his own knowledge how they burned and buried alive their\r\nprisoners. Sometimes they were massacred by the women. Even when their\r\nlives were spared they were often wholly or partially stripped, and the\r\neffect upon frames enfeebled by privation was generally fatal. It is\r\nuseless to dwell in detail upon the hideous barbarities perpetrated,\r\nstill less is it profitable to reprobate them. It must be said that\r\nif there be but too much testimony to the barbarity of the infuriated\r\nRussians, there is also plenty of evidence as to their frequent\r\nkindliness and humanity. At their worst be it remembered that they\r\nwere but retaliating for their own wrongs.\r\n\r\nThe mass of disbanded troops, which every day grew at the expense\r\nof those who remained faithful, consisted in the first place of men\r\nalready weakened, who therefore fell out early and of course died. Then\r\nthere were many who had not the spirit to bear up under their misery\r\nand wandered along in the crowd until they also fell and died. Lastly,\r\nthere were large numbers who were simply deserters--often of the worst\r\nkind--men who left the ranks before they were disabled and subsisted\r\nby murder and robbery. They did more than anything to destroy the\r\narmy. Some of the leaders of the faithful troops were aware of it. De\r\nFezensac tells how he ordered that no mercy or consideration was to be\r\nshown them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there were very many gallant soldiers of every rank\r\nwho kept their ranks and did their duty to the bitter end. Russian\r\neye-witnesses were full of admiration at the martial bearing of the\r\nscanty and ever dwindling battalions which, with eagles in their\r\nmidst, moved doggedly on through the miserable horde of skulkers. The\r\nofficers, with few exceptions, remained firm to their duty. Their\r\nintellectual and educational level was upon the whole naturally higher\r\nthan that of their men, and general good conduct among them was to\r\nbe expected. They were, too, generally better supplied with food and\r\nclothing, and exercised more judgment in providing themselves.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which demoralisation affected the strategic units of\r\nthe army is difficult to decide; and the task is a somewhat invidious\r\none. The 3rd Corps certainly appears to have kept the best order and\r\ndiscipline. It had taken a very small part in the demoralising sack\r\nof Moscow; but a great deal of its persistent good conduct must be\r\nattributed to the personal influence of its chief. The 1st Corps, on\r\nthe other hand, seems to have crumbled early. Davout was not a very\r\nsympathetic personage, and perhaps the care which he had always taken\r\nof his men, and his firm discipline, really unfitted them to bear the\r\nstrain of being in a condition of inferiority to the enemy. At any rate\r\nthe early demoralisation of the 1st Corps is an established fact. The\r\n4th Corps also rapidly disbanded, as did also, apparently, the 5th and\r\n8th. Of the cavalry we hear little. The Guard took the lion’s share of\r\nwhatever food and shelter was to be had; nevertheless its conduct was\r\nnot relatively better than that of the 3rd Corps--perhaps not so good,\r\nsince it never experienced the same trials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of the approximate positions of the French and\r\nRussian Main Armies on October 31st, to indicate the danger incurred by\r\nNapoleon’s extended order of march]\r\n\r\nNapoleon, with the Guard, reached Viasma on October 31st. The cold on\r\nthis day was greater than it had hitherto been; and the Emperor donned\r\na Polish dress of green, heavily furred, and a fur cap. At Viasma was\r\nGeneral Evers’ column of drafts. There was also in the place a small\r\nmagazine of bread, biscuit, flour, and rice. It was pillaged by the\r\nleading troops, and so great was the demoralisation that much of the\r\ntown was destroyed, though thousands tramping painfully behind were\r\nthus deprived of shelter. On this day the Guard, the 2nd and 4th\r\nCavalry Corps, and Junot’s Corps were about Viasma; Ney one march short\r\nof it; Eugène and Poniatowski about Gzhatsk, and Davout at Gridnevo.\r\nThe line was nearly 70 miles long from front to rear. Miloradovich was\r\nnear at hand with his cavalry, but his infantry could not arrive before\r\nthe 3rd. Kutuzov also was marching for Viasma, but was still 60 miles\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nDavout’s slow withdrawal was doubtless dictated by a desire to save as\r\nmuch as possible of the artillery and trains; but in the circumstances\r\nit was impossible to do much, and it would have been better to abandon\r\nat once everything that fell behind. Lack of shelter, inadequate food,\r\nand the steady harassing of Platov was rapidly breaking up the 1st\r\nCorps. It had already abandoned 20 guns and much of its trains; the\r\nroads were dotted with men and horses dead of fatigue.\r\n\r\nNapoleon remained for 36 hours at Viasma, principally occupied with\r\ndesk-work. He informed the generals in the rear of his retrograde\r\nmarch, representing it as a purely voluntary movement made to come\r\ninto touch with his wings. From Baraguay d’Hilliers he learned that\r\nhe had advanced to Selnia, and despatched orders for him to return\r\nto Smolensk. From Victor he became aware that the 9th Corps had been\r\nforced to support St. Cyr.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ilovaïski IV, temporarily commanding Winzingerode’s detachment,\r\nhad reoccupied Moscow on October 23rd. He found there some 1500 sick\r\nand wounded whom Mortier had been unable to evacuate, and 42 mounted\r\nguns, of which 24 were French.\r\n\r\nNey’s corps reached Viasma on November 1st. Miloradovich continued to\r\nmove parallel to the road, hastening the march of his infantry and\r\nanxious to strike a blow. At 11 a.m. on the 2nd Napoleon left for\r\nSemlevo. Davout in the evening arrived at a point about 9 miles from\r\nViasma and a little more than 1 east of the village of Federovskoië.\r\nEugène and Poniatowski were between Viasma and Federovskoië. Ney was\r\nto take over rear-guard duty as soon as Davout should pass Viasma.\r\nNapoleon was angry with the slowness of the latter; but the orders\r\nwhich he issued to hasten the march of the trains could not be executed\r\nowing to the deplorable state of the horses. The orders to prevent\r\nstraggling were equally impossible of execution. None the less,\r\nDavout had certainly moved very slowly, and there was some excuse\r\nfor the Emperor’s irritated remark that “the Prince of Eckmuhl keeps\r\nthe Viceroy and Poniatowski waiting for every band of Cossacks that\r\nhe sees.” In justice to Davout it must be said that the young and\r\ninexperienced Eugène appears often to have delayed him by his own lack\r\nof speed.\r\n\r\nAt 8 a.m. on the 3rd Miloradovich with Korff’s and Vassilchikov’s\r\ndivisions reached Maximovo, a village some 2 miles from Federovskoië,\r\nand about 1 mile south of the high-road. Davout was passing through\r\nFederovskoië, his leading division--Gérard’s--being nearly abreast of\r\nMaximovo. The Hussars of Akhtyrka, supported by a brigade of dragoons,\r\nboldly charged the head of Gérard’s column, while the Russian horse\r\nartillery opened a brisk cannonade on his flank. The 2nd Corps could\r\nnot come into action before ten; while Kutuzov was only just leaving\r\nDubna, nearly 30 miles from Viasma.\r\n\r\nGérard’s division, attacked without warning, was checked in its march\r\nupon Viasma. Platov was close on Davout’s rear, and as soon as he heard\r\nthe sound of Miloradovich’s cannonade he pressed home his advance,\r\nPaskievich marching straight upon Fedorovskoië, while Platov turned it\r\non the left. Davout saw that there was not a moment to lose in clearing\r\nthe way before the arrival of Miloradovich’s infantry, and hurried his\r\ndivisions up at the double to support Gérard. Eugène turned back to his\r\ncolleague’s support, while Poniatowski took up a position in advance\r\nof Viasma to support Eugène. Ney posted his corps to the right of the\r\ntown, behind the Viasma river; he threw a bridge across it in order to\r\nfacilitate the retirement of his colleagues’ trains. The river makes an\r\nacute angle a little south of the town, so that Ney had it both before\r\nand behind him; he threw a second bridge over it to assure his own\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nMiloradovich had available for the conflict the 2nd and 4th Army\r\nCorps, Paskievich’s division of the 7th and Platov’s Flying Corps,\r\nperhaps 30,000 or 32,000 combatants in all, with some 120 guns. The\r\nestimates of the French force vary. Davout may have had 20,000 infantry\r\nand artillery, Eugène perhaps 15,000, Ney probably 8000, Poniatowski\r\nabout 3500. The remains of the corps cavalry and of the 1st and 3rd\r\nReserve Corps probably could not muster 4000 mounted men. The artillery\r\ncould still count over 300 guns, but the worn-out state of their\r\nteams rendered them incapable of manoeuvring. The troops, with the\r\nexception of those of Ney, were demoralised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF VIASMA\r\n\r\nPositions about 10 a.m.]\r\n\r\nDavout’s troops, ranged in dense battalion columns, attacked the\r\nRussian cavalry on the road and broke through, scattering the hostile\r\nsquadrons, some of which had to retreat towards the north to join\r\nPlatov. This appears to have occurred at about 10 a.m. Paskievich\r\nmeanwhile had carried Federovskoië, and Platov was harassing the French\r\non the right; while Prince Eugen’s division of the 2nd Corps formed\r\nacross the road just as the Russian horsemen gave way and poured a\r\nheavy fire into the head of Davout’s column. The Marshal’s position\r\nwas extremely critical. The Viceroy, however, was now close at hand\r\nwith Broussier’s and Guilleminot’s divisions and the 5th Corps. He\r\ncannonaded the flank and rear of the 4th Division and attacked it with\r\na cloud of skirmishers. Its commander believed that he could hold his\r\nown, but Miloradovich was of a different opinion, and, seeing the force\r\nwhich was coming from Viasma, he was probably correct. Eugen drew\r\nback into line with the rest of the Russian infantry on the south of\r\nthe road, and Davout’s troops were able to defile past. But they had\r\nsuffered considerably, and the disorder among them was increased by the\r\ncannonade beneath which they had to march. The trains streamed away to\r\nthe north of the road to reach Viasma, while the 1st Corps inclined to\r\nthe south to come into line with the 4th and 5th Corps. Eugène formed\r\nacross the road with Poniatowski in support; but as Platov spread\r\nto the north he threw back his right wing. Davout’s troops were on\r\nEugène’s right, nearly parallel with the line of the road. To support\r\nand steady them Ney advanced Razout’s division, while Ledru’s remained\r\nto check Uvarov, who was now coming up with Kutuzov’s advance-guard.\r\nUvarov, however, who had only the bulk of Golitzin’s Cuirassiers under\r\nhis command, could only confine himself to a desultory cannonade. The\r\nhead of Kutuzov’s column reached Bykovo, 5 miles from Viasma, in the\r\nafternoon, but it had marched 22 miles already and could hardly engage\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\nMiloradovich, after Davout had passed, deployed his whole force across\r\nthe road and marched forward, Eugen’s, Paskievich’s and Choglokov’s\r\ndivisions in first line, the remaining two in reserve, Platov pushing\r\nforward on the right, Korff and Vassilchikov in reserve and on the\r\nleft. The French generals, fearing that at any moment Kutuzov might\r\ndebouch in their rear, held a conference on the road, and decided\r\nto retreat. The final withdrawal commenced at about 2 p.m. Eugène\r\nand Poniatowski succeeded in passing through the town in fair order;\r\nbut Davout’s shaken troops fell back in confusion, hotly pressed by\r\nPaskievich and Choglokov. Ney covered the retreat of his colleague to\r\nthe utmost of his power, and retired through Viasma, burning such of it\r\nas remained intact. The French bivouacked in the woods on the west of\r\nthe town. The night proved bitterly cold.\r\n\r\nThe French losses are usually stated at 4000 killed and wounded. Those\r\nof the Russians may have amounted to 2500. Miloradovich captured 3 guns\r\nand about 2000 prisoners, besides some thousands of the disbanded mob.\r\nAmong the prisoners was General Pelletier, commanding the artillery\r\nof the 5th Corps. The French writers attribute the defeat mainly to\r\nDavout’s error in inclining to his right as he fell back instead of his\r\nleft, but it is doubtful whether this was more than a subsidiary cause.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th Kutuzov remained inactive at Bykovo. His troops may have\r\nneeded rest, but it is extraordinary that he made no attempt to crush\r\nor at least to harass the weary, half-starved and beaten French army\r\nbehind the Viasma. Perhaps he was imposed upon by Ney’s bold show in\r\nthe rear, and the good order of the undemoralised 3rd Corps. It is\r\nperhaps difficult to judge him, since we can scarcely appreciate the\r\nvast influence exercised by the prestige of the Napoleonic army upon\r\nthe minds of its opponents everywhere save in Britain. But to say the\r\nleast, he could and should have done much more.\r\n\r\nNey, early on the 4th, took up a strong position on the edge of the\r\nwoods. Beurmann was detached to the right to observe Uvarov, whom he\r\nheld in check during the day. Meanwhile the 1st, 4th and 5th Corps\r\ndefiled on the road to Dorogobuzh. All were in the greatest disorder.\r\nThe men were worn out with fatigue and appeared hopelessly discouraged,\r\nonly the Royal Guard of Italy still marched in fair order. The number\r\nof stragglers, of whom the majority had thrown away their arms, was\r\nenormous. Ney was much impressed by the disorder of the 1st Corps, and\r\nhis despatch upon the battle contained some bitter remarks upon it, as\r\nwell as the haphazard conduct of the engagement.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of the 3rd Corps for the 1st rear-guard duty was\r\nanother proof that Napoleon did not really understand the critical\r\nstate of affairs. Ney was an ideal rear-guard leader, and the 3rd Corps\r\nwas an intact and undiscouraged force, but it consisted of only two\r\ndivisions (the Württemberg troops having been amalgamated with the\r\nother two) as against the five of the 1st.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak on the 5th the 3rd Corps withdrew in good order, but\r\nfollowed and impeded by at least 4000 disbanded men of the other corps.\r\nDe Fezensac, in bivouac that night, ordered all able-bodied skulkers\r\nto be driven away by force from the fires. Near Semlevo there was an\r\naction with the leading troops of Miloradovich, but the 3rd Corps\r\nwas not molested on the 6th. Kutuzov, had he pushed forward on the\r\n4th, would certainly have destroyed Ney and probably Eugène also. The\r\nRussians were so strong in cavalry that they could always retard the\r\nFrench retreat by employing it vigorously to harass the moving columns.\r\nHowever this may be, Kutuzov on the 5th bent south-westward to Ielnia,\r\nwhile Miloradovich and Platov continued to follow and harass the\r\nFrench rear-guard. Many stragglers were slain or taken by the Cossacks\r\nand waggons were abandoned in numbers; but no impression was made upon\r\nNey’s corps, which continued its march to Dorogobuzh and there took up\r\na position.\r\n\r\nNapoleon had intended to receive battle east of Dorogobuzh. His plan\r\nappears in his correspondence, and it can only be characterised as\r\nutterly impracticable. It assumed that the whole Russian Army was\r\nfollowing on the main road, and also counted upon being able to\r\nambuscade their advance-guard. Even had the army been less reduced and\r\ndemoralised this would have been impossible, the Russians being so\r\nstrong in cavalry. The plan was not executed; by the time that he had\r\ndrawn it up Napoleon had probably read Ney’s despatch of the 4th, in\r\nwhich the marshal stated his conviction that only a part of the Russian\r\narmy was at Viasma. Next day Ney reported that he had learned that\r\nRussian columns were passing him on the right; and Napoleon retreated\r\nwith the Guard upon Mikalevka.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th and 7th the weather, which had hitherto been by day\r\ncomparatively mild, changed for the worse, with violent gales and heavy\r\nsnowstorms. After this the destruction of the army proceeded apace.\r\nThe horses were the first to suffer; it was impossible to obtain any\r\nforage with the ground covered deep with snow. No provision had been\r\nmade for rough-shoeing the horses, except by the Polish cavalry; and\r\non the slippery surface of the trodden snow they fell in hundreds,\r\nto be preyed upon by the starving troops. Vehicles of every kind\r\nhad to be abandoned; and each was instantly plundered by a group of\r\nwolfish stragglers, often to the accompaniment of murder. The number\r\nof disbanded men rapidly increased, and their lawlessness and savagery\r\ngrew even more quickly. Had it been possible to maintain better\r\ndiscipline the state of the army might have been less intolerable.\r\nTerrible as the conditions were, they could have been somewhat\r\nameliorated had there been a better sense of comradeship among the\r\ntroops, which might have prevented so many of them from disbanding and\r\ndegenerating into veritable wild beasts.\r\n\r\nBut in truth the misery was so great that the finest loyalty and\r\nsteadiness could not greatly have alleviated it. Had there been\r\na sufficiency of even the coarsest food, the troops might have\r\nwithstood the cold. But almost the only resource remaining was the\r\nunwholesome flesh of the worn-down horses. Even the officers were often\r\nlittle better off as regards meat, though they could still procure\r\nsmall quantities of biscuit or flour. The troops as a whole were\r\ninsufficiently clad and, above all, ill-shod; those who succeeded in\r\nobtaining a little food were often disabled by frost-bite or injuries\r\nto their ill-protected feet. In the hope of guarding against the deadly\r\ncold the men overloaded themselves with clothing of every kind and\r\nquality, often filthy rags torn from the dead and dying. In their fear\r\nof taking a fatal chill they never removed them even for necessary\r\npurposes, and dared not wash. In their ravening hunger they ate like\r\nwild beasts, tearing the raw or half-cooked horse-flesh with their\r\nteeth, and covering themselves and their wretched garments with blood\r\nand offal. Their appearance soon became indescribably hideous, and the\r\nresult of their panic-born neglect was, of course, loathsome disease.\r\nSelfishness increased with misery; men thrust their weaker comrades\r\nfrom the bivouac fires, and fought for the wretched carrion on which\r\nthey strove to maintain their existence; while those who fell were\r\nrobbed and stripped by passers-by.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nTHE RETREAT OF THE FRENCH FROM MOSCOW\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by Adam]\r\n\r\nAmid all this misery and lack of self-respect there was much that\r\nredounds to the credit of human nature. Many soldiers added to their\r\nhardships by endeavouring to assist the women and children who followed\r\nthe army. Officers who possessed private carriages gave them up to\r\nthese unhappy fugitives; those attached to the head-quarters, which\r\nwas better provided than the rest of the army, succeeded in saving\r\nmany. Unhappily the most necessary requisite was food, and this the\r\nchivalrous protectors could not often give their charges. The hardy\r\nfemale followers could protect and provide for themselves to some\r\nextent, but too many of the officers’ wives or connections were utterly\r\nhelpless, and their fate was a piteous one.\r\n\r\nOne of the most awful incidents of the retreat was the fate of the\r\nRussian prisoners, of whom some 2000--stragglers, convalescents,\r\nand civilians--were dragged with the army, under a guard made up of\r\nfragments and detachments of every nation. From the first the captives\r\nwere treated with gross cruelty and neglect. The weakly ones who fell\r\nbehind were done to death without mercy. Every night the survivors were\r\nhuddled together, fireless, on the bare ground, without food save a\r\nlittle raw horse-flesh. Before long even this was not forthcoming, and\r\nthe miserable prisoners, driven along and herded together like wild\r\nbeasts by men who were losing the traces of humanity, perished amid\r\nhorrible misery. Cannibalism is said to have raged among them. There\r\nis no darker stain on the escutcheon of Napoleon (who must be held\r\nultimately responsible) than this treatment of men who were at any rate\r\nopen enemies, and some of whom were not even combatants.\r\n\r\nDay by day the number of men in the ranks dwindled. Every bivouac was\r\nthe graveyard of hundreds of men and thousands of horses; the line of\r\nmarch resembled a long battlefield. The roads were strewn with dead\r\nor dying men and horses, abandoned guns and vehicles, and wreckage of\r\nevery kind. Amid this streamed westward in wild confusion the endless\r\nprocession of disbanded men and male and female camp-followers,\r\naccompanied by vehicles of all kinds, through which the troops still\r\nwith the colours could scarcely force their way. Many men were already\r\nso weak that they could hardly stumble along. Some became idiotic\r\nwith privation and the spectacle of the misery about them. The plight\r\nof the troops in the ranks was no better; their devotion to duty only\r\nprolonged their sufferings. Ill-clad, starving, stricken with cold\r\nand disease, often half-blind from the effects of the glaring snow by\r\nday and the smoke of the fires at night, it is wonderful that they\r\never managed, as they did, to make some kind of fight. Their duties,\r\nwhen they had strength to carry them out, were confined to beating off\r\nthe hovering Cossacks, and to destroying guns and waggons that would\r\notherwise have been abandoned.\r\n\r\nFrom Dorogobuzh Eugène’s corps was diverted towards Dukhovchina with\r\nthe intention of directing it thence upon Vitebsk to relieve the\r\npressure upon Victor by Wittgenstein. The result was its practical\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nOn November 7th Eugen of Württemberg attacked Razout’s division\r\nbefore Dorogobuzh and after some obstinate fighting, partly owing to\r\nthe indecision of its short-sighted commander, forced it to retreat\r\nthrough the town with a loss of several hundred men and 4 guns. Ney,\r\nwho had hoped to delay Miloradovich for a day, was obliged to fall\r\nback towards Smolensk. Dorogobuzh was choked with disbanded men, who\r\nwere ruthlessly murdered or stripped by the exasperated inhabitants. A\r\nwatchmaker boasted of having killed 11 Frenchmen with a knife which he\r\nhad concealed for the purpose! Miloradovich, however, was then obliged\r\nto draw off his infantry towards the south for the sake of food and\r\nshelter against the cold. He left the pursuit of Ney to Major-General\r\nYurkovski with a brigade of dragoons and some Cossacks, while Platov\r\nfollowed Eugène towards Dukhovchina.\r\n\r\nAt Mikalevka Napoleon learned of Malet’s audacious conspiracy in Paris,\r\nand the tidings doubtless did not tend to relieve his mind. On the 8th\r\nJunot’s corps arrived at Smolensk; but the day before that ruined town\r\nhad been invaded by crowds of disbanded troops. Junot was not allowed\r\nto pass his corps into it, and cantoned it in villages on the Mstislavl\r\nroad. Napoleon himself arrived on the 9th, only to be met by bad news\r\nfrom every side.\r\n\r\nVictor was proving unable to hold back Wittgenstein. Baraguay\r\nd’Hilliers’ division, as has been related, had pushed out to Ielnia,\r\nand was retiring upon Smolensk, when on this day his rear-guard\r\nbrigade, 2000 strong, under General Augereau, was surrounded in the\r\nvillage of Liakhova by Orlov-Denisov, with his own flying detachment\r\nand those of Davidov, Seslavin, and Figner. Augereau was without\r\nartillery, and not being supported by Baraguay d’Hilliers, who showed\r\ngreat irresolution, was forced to surrender. Baraguay d’Hilliers\r\nretreated hastily to Smolensk with the rest of his division, and was\r\nvery properly ordered home for trial. Besides Augereau’s brigade\r\nseveral depôts or posts of troops were captured by the Russian advanced\r\ndetachments. Kutuzov reached Chelkanovo on the Smolensk-Mstislavl road,\r\nabout 25 miles from Smolensk, on the 12th. He had not marched very\r\nrapidly--some 120 miles in 9 days--but it is true that both roads and\r\nweather were terrible. The Russians were well clothed and fairly well\r\nfed; but many of the Russian troops were young, and the snowy bivouacs\r\nhad disastrous effects upon their unformed constitutions.\r\n\r\nOn this same disastrous day, the 9th, Eugène’s corps, after 3 days’\r\nstruggling through the snow, reached the small river Vop, only 30\r\nmiles from Dorogobuzh. The Viceroy had already lost 1200 of his\r\nremaining horses and much of his artillery. He had sent on a detachment\r\nto bridge the stream, but materials were lacking, and the wretched\r\nsoldiers were forced to wade. The Royal Guard led the way, with Eugène\r\nin their midst, with ice and water up to their waists, formed on the\r\nopposite bank and drove away Platov’s vanguard, which was already\r\nacross. Platov himself was tormenting the rear-guard with his light\r\nartillery, and threatening the unhappy column in flank and rear. When\r\nEugène had crossed an effort was made to bring over the artillery\r\nand baggage. The steep banks of the stream had been hurriedly made\r\npracticable for vehicles, but the inclines were quickly covered with\r\nice; the ford was soon choked by guns and waggons sticking fast in\r\nthe mud, and eventually all but the small proportion which crossed\r\nfirst had to be abandoned. There were terrible scenes on the bank\r\nwhen this became known. A turmoil of fighting, pillage and murder\r\nreigned. Many worn-out soldiers, struggling through the icy water,\r\nwere overcome by the cold and drowned: many others died in the night.\r\nBroussier’s division covered the rear against Platov all night, and\r\nonly crossed on the morning of the 10th, leaving behind them many sick\r\nand wounded, a vast quantity of baggage and some 60 guns. Hundreds of\r\nmen, overcome by cold, threw away their arms. The bulk of the corps\r\nstreamed along the road to Dukhovchina completely disorganised; only\r\nthe Royal Guard and Broussier’s division still moved with some show\r\nof order. Dukhovchina was already occupied by Cossacks--the leading\r\nregiments of Winzingerode’s old detachment, now under Major-General\r\nGolénischev-Kutuzov. They, however, of course had to retire before the\r\nadvance of the Royal Guard, and Eugène occupied the town. It had not\r\nyet been plundered, and the exhausted remnants of the 4th Corps were\r\nable to obtain food and a little rest. On the 12th Eugène set fire to\r\nDukhovchina and retreated on Smolensk, where he arrived on the 13th,\r\nsurrounded and harassed all the way by the indefatigable Cossacks. He\r\nhad with the colours only 6000 or 7000 armed men, and 20 guns at most\r\nout of over 100.\r\n\r\nDavout’s and Poniatowski’s[7] troops made their way from Viasma to\r\nSmolensk with little opposition from the Russians, but disintegrating\r\nday by day under the influence of cold, fatigue and hunger. The Poles\r\nseem to have completely broken up, and only about 800 privates reached\r\nSmolensk. On the other hand, they saved a large proportion of their\r\nartillery, owing to their sensible precautions in rough-shoeing their\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nNey reached the Dnieper at Solovievo on the 19th. The approach to\r\nthe bridge was choked for more than half a mile with abandoned guns\r\nand waggons; and before passing Ney ordered his men to fire them.\r\nIn doing so they came upon some remnants of food supplies and some\r\nspirits. In the woods on both sides of the road were thousands of\r\nstragglers, largely wounded, whom the omnipresent Cossacks massacred\r\nand plundered under the very eyes of their comrades. In the evening the\r\n3rd Corps passed the river and destroyed the bridge. It defended the\r\npassage against Yurkovski’s brigade, the Cossacks, and some supporting\r\ninfantry, until the 12th, and then retreated on Smolensk, in weather\r\nso awful that even the Russian Löwenstern speaks of it as something\r\nexceptional. It was impossible to halt for fear of freezing, while the\r\nicebound road was fatal to hundreds of exhausted men. A terrible night\r\nin bivouac put the capstone on the sufferings of the devoted 3rd Corps.\r\nOn the 4th it entered Smolensk--some 4000 men left of more than 11,000\r\nwho had marched from Moscow.\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary to turn aside to follow the fortunes of Napoleon’s\r\nwings. On October 29th Victor joined Merle at Chasniki, at the junction\r\nof the little river Lukomlia with the Ula, about 17 miles south-west\r\nof Bechenkowiczi. Dändels had already joined Legrand. Wittgenstein\r\nand Steingell united at Lepel on the same day and reached the Ula on\r\nthe 30th. They were, however, owing to the detachment of Vlastov’s\r\ndivision, not more than 33,000 strong, while the 2nd and 9th Corps,\r\neven in the absence of Corbineau, mustered 36,000 infantry and 4000\r\ncavalry. Victor therefore decided to attack, and sent to call in\r\nDändels and Legrand. Owing to misunderstandings, however, neither\r\nLegrand nor the cavalry of the 9th Corps arrived, and Victor hesitated\r\nto attack. Wittgenstein drove Victor’s advance troops over the\r\nLukomlia, and brought a mass of artillery into action, which gained\r\nthe advantage over the French guns. After a long cannonade the action\r\ndied away, and before dawn on November 1st Victor retreated upon\r\nSienno, about 25 miles east of Chasniki. He had suffered no reverse,\r\nand, indeed, had hardly engaged his troops. He may have thought, as\r\nDe Chambray says, that it would be better to temporise until he was\r\nreinforced by Napoleon. Wittgenstein did not pursue, but moved Harpe’s\r\ndivision towards Bechenkowiczi to observe Victor’s movements. The\r\nlatter, after remaining for two days at Sienno, turned south-westward\r\nto Chereia, about 20 miles north of the Smolensk-Minsk road at Bobr.\r\nWhether this move was due to his fear for the highway cannot be\r\ndetermined, but the result was disastrous. On November 7th Harpe\r\nattacked Vitebsk, which was now uncovered. The small garrison, under\r\nGeneral Pouget, was either killed or captured.\r\n\r\nOn October 29th, Chichagov started from Brest-Litovsk for Minsk. To\r\nhold back Schwarzenberg he left with Sacken the divisions of Bulatov,\r\nLieven, and Essen III, a total of about 27,000 combatants, with 96\r\nguns. Under his own command were the 2 corps of Voïnov and Sabaniev,\r\nforming together the _Corps de Bataille_ under Langeron, and two\r\nadvance-guards commanded by Lambert and Chaplitz--33,000 men with 180\r\nguns. Chichagov sent orders to Ertel to advance from Mozyr to meet\r\nhim. General Musin Pushkin was left with 4000 or 5000 men to guard\r\nthe Volhynian frontier. The Admiral left Pruzhani on the 30th and\r\nreached Slonim on November 3rd. He might have moved more rapidly, but\r\nhe explained to the Tzar that he hoped to draw Schwarzenberg upon him\r\nand be able to strike hard at him before marching upon Minsk. He waited\r\nabout Slonim until November 8th in this expectation, then, feeling that\r\nfurther delay would be dangerous, started for Minsk. He had, in fact,\r\nwaited too long already.\r\n\r\nSchwarzenberg, having left Kosinski’s Poles to cover Warsaw and one of\r\nDurutte’s regiments to garrison that capital, concentrated the rest\r\nof his army at Bieloslok, and marched for Volkovisk, which he reached\r\non November 8th, Chichagov being nearly 60 miles in advance with his\r\nway clear before him. On the 14th Schwarzenberg was at Slonim with his\r\nAustrians, while Reynier and Durutte were at Volkovisk. Sacken broke\r\nup from Brest-Litovsk on November 1st. He left Colonel Witte with 3\r\nbattalions and 2 newly joined Cossack regiments to cover his base, and\r\nmarched for Volkovisk. Between him and his objective lay the extensive\r\nforest of Bielovezhi, which he had to skirt, but on November 12th he\r\nwas nearing Volkovisk, throwing forward his right in order to interpose\r\nbetween Schwarzenberg and Reynier. The latter, fearing to be assailed\r\nin flank, fell back upon Volkovisk.\r\n\r\nVolkovisk lies upon the right bank of the river Rossi, which flows\r\nnorthward to the Niemen. Hard by the town a rivulet entered the Rossi.\r\nBoth were now frozen. North of the town are some low heights, and on\r\nthese the bulk of Reynier’s army was posted; but his head-quarters were\r\nin Volkovisk itself.\r\n\r\nSacken decided that his best course was to vigorously attack Reynier,\r\nso as, at least, to bring back Schwarzenberg to his assistance. It was\r\na bold but perilous resolve, since Sacken was not greatly superior even\r\nto Reynier in numbers, and might be taken in rear by the Austrians.\r\nIn the night of the 14th-15th his advance-guard surprised Volkovisk,\r\ndriving out its garrison and nearly capturing Reynier. The advance of\r\nthe Russian column, however, was then checked by Durutte.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th Reynier took up a position behind the town, his right,\r\nconsisting of Saxons, resting on the wooded bank of the Rossi, Durutte\r\nin the centre, and more Saxons on the left. Sacken was drawn up south\r\nof the town, with Bulatov on the right, Essen in the centre, and Lieven\r\non the left.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 15th Durutte retook Volkovisk. Sacken did not attempt\r\nto recover it. The day passed in desultory cannonading, except on\r\nReynier’s left, where the Russian cavalry of Bulatov’s corps, under\r\nMelissino, endeavoured to take advantage of a movement of Saxon\r\ninfantry to charge, but was handsomely repulsed by their horsemen.\r\n\r\nSchwarzenberg, informed of Sacken’s advance, left Frimont with about\r\n7000 men at Slonim, and returned towards Volkovisk with the remaining\r\n18,000. On the 15th his advance-guard was already well on the way; but\r\nSacken, misled by the false reports of some prisoners, decided to press\r\nhome his attack upon Reynier. On the 16th he recaptured Volkovisk, and\r\nabout midday developed a heavy attack upon Reynier’s left, when guns\r\nwere heard on the road to Slonim nearly in rear of Sacken’s centre,\r\nand fugitives from the guards of baggage which had been sent there\r\nannounced that Schwarzenberg was at hand. Sacken at once began to\r\nwithdraw towards the left, first Lieven, then Essen, finally Bulatov.\r\nIt was dark before even Essen began his march, and the army retreated\r\nsafely to Svislozh on the Brest-Litovsk road.\r\n\r\nHe was hotly pursued by Schwarzenberg and Reynier, the latter following\r\nhim on the main road, while Schwarzenberg threatened to turn his\r\nright, and interpose between him and the Bielovezhi Forest. During the\r\nnext ten days there was constant rear-guard fighting, though never\r\nof a very severe description, as Sacken made his way back towards\r\nBrest-Litovsk. On the 25th he took up a position to cover that place,\r\nbut his opponents were manifestly too strong for him, and on the 26th\r\nit was reoccupied by Reynier. The net result of Sacken’s operations\r\nwas that he had drawn Schwarzenberg far away from the decisive point\r\non the Berezina. On the 25th the Austrian general received a letter\r\nfrom Maret at Vilna, bidding him turn back to support Napoleon. This\r\nhe at once did, but whatever he might or might not wish it was now\r\nfar too late. On the 27th, when he set out to remeasure his steps,\r\nNapoleon was already crossing the Berezina, threatened by Chichagov and\r\nWittgenstein. Sacken’s losses during his brief campaign had been heavy,\r\nthough certainly they had not approached the figure of 10,000, at which\r\nthe French estimated them. He had lost also a considerable part of his\r\ntrains. The losses of his opponents were perhaps about 3000 killed,\r\nwounded, and prisoners. The importance of the strategic success of the\r\nRussians is not, however, to be expressed in terms of losses.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the central Napoleonic army were collected at Smolensk\r\nby November 13th. The leading troops had thus some five days’ rest from\r\nmarching, but little alleviation of their misery. There had been some\r\n1500 beef-cattle in the villages round the town, but most of these were\r\nswept up by the Cossacks who preceded the march of the main Russian\r\narmy. In Smolensk itself there were considerable stores of flour,\r\ngrain, and brandy--probably enough to supply the remains of the army\r\nfor several days. There was also a certain quantity of biscuit, rice,\r\nand dried vegetables. The Guard as usual was unduly favoured. Napoleon\r\nordered that it should have 15 days’ supplies issued to it, while the\r\nother unhappy corps were only to have six. Judging, however, from\r\nnarratives of members of the Guard, it never received anything like the\r\namount ordered. The men, hungry and improvident, seem to have largely\r\ngorged themselves on their rations; a good many sold them at exorbitant\r\nprices to others; in this way the survivors of Preising’s Bavarian\r\nhorsemen were able to obtain a little food. Portable mills, which had\r\nby this time begun to arrive, were also issued. Even in their misery\r\nthe soldiers made bitter jests at this provision for grinding flour\r\nwhich was not to be had. Shelter there was little. Eyewitnesses give\r\ngrim accounts of the wretchedness within the walls. As corps after\r\ncorps reached the town in their misery the hospitals were choked with\r\nsick and wounded, who were literally heaped into these dens of horror\r\nwithout provision of any kind. The cold was worse than it yet had\r\nbeen, and the men were frost-bitten by hundreds. It was fortunate for\r\nNapoleon that a thaw set in on the 14th. While in the town the troops\r\nhad at any rate food enough for immediate needs, the troops of Junot\r\nand Zayonczek in the villages outside were left unprovided for, with\r\nthe result that they pillaged such convoys as passed near them, and ate\r\nhundreds of serviceable horses.\r\n\r\nThe army received indeed considerable reinforcements at Smolensk.\r\nBaraguay d’Hilliers’ column was distributed among the corps as they\r\narrived. The Vistula Legion was joined by its 3rd battalions, Ney’s\r\ncorps by the 129th Regiment and that of Illyria. It is difficult to\r\nstate the strength of the army on the 14th, but it may be perhaps\r\nestimated at nearly 60,000 men. The Guard still retained about 2500\r\nbadly mounted horsemen; all the other cavalry divisions did not\r\nmuster more than 3000 mounted men between them. The remnant of the\r\nCavalry Reserve--some 2000 sabres--was collected under the command of\r\nLatour-Maubourg. Much of the artillery, which had been so far dragged\r\nalong, could no longer proceed, and 140 pieces were abandoned in\r\nSmolensk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nRUSSIAN GRENADIERS PURSUING THE FRENCH ARMY\r\n\r\nFrom the picture by Verestchagin]\r\n\r\nOn the 13th the remains of Eugène’s corps poured in wild confusion\r\ninto the town. An issue of rations was commenced, but the starving\r\nmen broke from control and pillaged the magazines. Order was restored\r\nby desperate exertions, but there had been much damage and waste of\r\nprecious food. Next day the 1st Corps flooded into Smolensk in a\r\nstate as pitiable as that of the 4th, and the disorder of this\r\nerstwhile best disciplined of the army corps could not be restrained.\r\nThe storehouses were broken open amid frenzied scenes of disorder and\r\nviolence; the miserable wretches murdered one another at the doors and\r\nin the streets. The provisions were pillaged, a great part of them\r\nbeing of course destroyed in the confusion. Nothing was left for Ney’s\r\nbrave men, who were sacrificing themselves to save the rest of the\r\narmy, except such remnants as they could obtain by searching for them.\r\n\r\nKutuzov meanwhile was advancing with a slowness and caution which\r\nexasperated the more eager of his subordinates and caused some of them\r\nto mutter angrily about treachery. On the 14th he marched 13 miles\r\nfrom Chelkanovo to Jurovo, and halted for a day. It may well be, as\r\nClausewitz reasonably remarks, that his firmness was shaken by the\r\ndeteriorating condition of his own army, which was suffering severely\r\nfrom the cold, and perishing in bivouac at an alarming rate, though,\r\nof course, less rapidly than the _Grande Armée_, since the soldiers\r\nwere fairly well fed. This, however, would probably have impelled a\r\nyounger and more energetic man to deal a deadly blow at his opponents\r\nbefore his own force melted away. Kutuzov, however, was undoubtedly too\r\nold and infirm for the present crisis. Moreover, it is clear that the\r\nRussian scouts greatly overrated the French numbers largely because the\r\nstragglers were frequently mistaken for fighting men. A good many of\r\nthem still possessed weapons. Miloradovich left Choglokov’s division to\r\nwatch Ney before Smolensk, and himself with the bulk of his force moved\r\nround the town to join his commander-in-chief, while Platov moved past\r\nit on the north. On the 16th Kutuzov moved on to Chilova, 4-1/2 miles\r\nsouth-east of Krasnoï, and there halted.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th Napoleon directed Junot, with the 8th Corps and the remnant\r\nof the dismounted cavalry, and Zayonczek, with the 5th Corps, upon\r\nKrasnoï. Generals Eblé and Jomini had already been sent forward with\r\ndetachments of sappers to repair bridges and facilitate the march.\r\nBut already the disbanded troops had drawn ahead of the organised\r\nbodies and were streaming along the highway, pillaging convoys and\r\nspreading disorder everywhere. There were small magazines of food at\r\nKrasnoï, Liadi, Tolochin, and other places, and a larger one at Orsha.\r\nThe situation was thus in one sense less unfavourable than before.\r\nUnfortunately, however, the Russian army at Chilova was within easy\r\nreach of the high-road; and now Napoleon, as though his evil-genius\r\never directed him in 1812 to do the wrong thing, moved the remains of\r\nhis army along its front with a day’s interval between its corps!\r\n\r\nClaparède’s Poles, escorting the treasure and head-quarters baggage,\r\nand the little left of the reserve artillery, followed Junot. On the\r\n14th Napoleon left Smolensk with the Guard and Latour-Maubourg. Eugène\r\nwas to leave on the 15th, Davout on the 16th, Ney on the 17th, after\r\ndestroying the ramparts. Davout was to reinforce Ney with one of his\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th Count Ozharovski’s flying column entered Krasnoï, and\r\nbegan to destroy the stores collected there, but was driven out by\r\nClaparède’s division, and withdrew to Uvarova, on the Lossmina, 2 miles\r\nto the south-east. Early on the 15th Miloradovich, with the 2nd and 7th\r\nCorps and the 1st Cavalry Division, reached Riavka, a little way west\r\nof Korythnia, just as Napoleon and the Guard were passing. He opened\r\nwith his artillery, but did not venture to attack the infantry of the\r\nGuard, though the opportunity was surely worth seizing. He moved down\r\ninto the road when the last closed bodies had passed, and picked up\r\n11 abandoned guns and 2000 stragglers. He then moved along the road\r\nto Merlino, and took position across it with his front covered by a\r\nrivulet, flowing as usual in a difficult gully. Napoleon reached\r\nKrasnoï in safety, and the Guard camped about the little town.\r\n\r\nThough a thaw was setting in this brought little relief to the\r\nsufferings of the _Grande Armée_. Snow fell heavily, and the fatigue\r\nof tramping through it was enormous, while the damp foggy weather told\r\nalmost as heavily upon the men as the bitter cold of previous days. The\r\nhorses appear to have completely broken down, when after some kind of\r\nrest they had to resume the road. The artillery of the Guard, the best\r\nappointed of the army, took 22 hours to cover the first 13 miles out\r\nof Smolensk, and on reaching Krasnoï 12 of the 24 horse guns had to be\r\nabandoned. Half of Latour-Maubourg’s cavalry remnant were dismounted\r\nin 2 days, while divisions abandoned and destroyed their reserve parks\r\nwholesale, being utterly unable to get them through the broken country\r\nwest of Smolensk. The ravine of the Lossmina, east of Krasnoï, was one\r\nof the most fatal to the trains; guns, waggons and vehicles of every\r\nkind were literally heaped together to the east of it, where the road\r\npassed through a defile.\r\n\r\nEugène left Smolensk on the 15th, but it was difficult to get the\r\nworn-down troops and their fatal incubus of non-combatants away from\r\nthe town, and the 4th Corps by evening had only reached Lubna, about 7\r\nor 8 miles on the road to Krasnoï. On the 16th it continued its march,\r\nharassed all the way by clouds of Cossacks. On the afternoon of the\r\n16th it found its way barred by Miloradovich, Kutuzov on the same day\r\nreaching Chilova. Napoleon appears at last to have awakened to the\r\nnecessity of uniting his scattered columns, and remained at Krasnoï in\r\norder to allow the 4th, 1st and 3rd Corps to close up. Davout on this\r\nday left Smolensk with 4 divisions, and Zayonczek arrived at Dubrovna.\r\nThe shattered relics of the _Grande Armée_ were thus scattered on a\r\nline of 60 miles. Even if the Poles and Junot be discounted, owing to\r\ntheir small numbers, the main force was spread over 30 miles of road,\r\nwhile Kutuzov, with his whole army, seriously reduced but in fine heart\r\nand fair condition, lay close to its head.\r\n\r\nMiloradovich, at Merlino, had the 2nd Corps, under Prince Dolgoruki,\r\ndrawn up across the road, while Raievski lay parallel with it on the\r\nsouth. Uvarov’s cavalry were in reserve. The relics of the 4th Corps\r\ntotalled only some 6000 combatants and a few guns, besides about 1200\r\narmed stragglers, whom Guilleminot succeeded in collecting and forming.\r\nThese latter, however, were quickly repulsed, and driven behind the\r\nremains of the 4th Corps, which, with Broussier’s division on the\r\nleft, Phillipon’s (formerly Delzons’) in the centre and Pino’s on the\r\nright, steadily awaited destruction, cheering defiantly in answer\r\nto the heavy cannonade of the Russians. Eugène, of course, rejected\r\nwith disdain Miloradovich’s proposal of surrender, and moved forward.\r\nPaskievich’s extreme flank brigade was for a moment disordered by\r\nBroussier’s gallant advance, but the attack was speedily repulsed, and\r\nonly darkness saved the survivors of the 4th Corps. Leaving Broussier\r\nto cover the rear, Eugène filed the other divisions to the right and\r\nreached Krasnoï early on the 17th. He had only about 4000 men left.\r\nThe last guns had been captured, and Broussier’s division almost\r\nannihilated.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th, before daylight, Roguet’s division of the Young Guard had\r\nexpelled Ozharovski’s detachment from the villages which it occupied to\r\nthe south of Krasnoï. Roguet, of course, could not pursue his slight\r\nsuccess, as the whole Russian army was now nearing Krasnoï, but its\r\neffect was to render Kutuzov more than ever cautious and circumspect.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Eugène convinced Napoleon that if Davout and Ney were\r\nto be saved he must make a stand in order to allow them to close up\r\nupon him. The 4th Corps was incapable of taking any part in the action,\r\nand he ordered it to defile on the road to Orsha. The infantry of the\r\nGuard was drawn up to the south of Krasnoï, Claparède’s division in\r\nthe town, Laborde in the centre, Roguet on the left near the Lossmina\r\nravine. The Old Guard, the cavalry, and Latour-Maubourg’s few remaining\r\nmounted troopers, with 30 guns were to move back towards Smolensk to\r\nmeet Davout. Napoleon’s total strength amounted to less than 18,000\r\nmen, of whom 2500 were cavalry in miserable condition; while only the\r\nlight artillery of the Young Guard could manoeuvre away from the road.\r\n\r\nDavout had left Smolensk on the 16th, and his leading division\r\nbivouacked for the night about 2 miles past Korythnia. There the\r\nMarshal learnt of Eugène’s disaster. Sending off messengers to warn Ney\r\nthat he must hasten his march, he broke up at 3 a.m.\r\n\r\nKutuzov on his side had made up his mind to attack. Prince Golitzin,\r\nwith the 3rd Corps and the 2nd Cuirassier division, was to attack the\r\nGuard in front. Miloradovich, strengthened by Korff’s cavalry, was\r\nto take position about Larionovo, a little east of the Lossmina, and\r\nlet Davout go by; but was then to fall vigorously upon his rear, and\r\nincline to the left to support Golitzin. Tormazov with the 5th, 6th and\r\n8th Corps, and the 1st Cuirassier Division, was to move to the left\r\nand bar Napoleon’s line of retreat. Ostermann and Vassilchikov were\r\nsome distance to the rear, but could easily come up during the day.\r\nExclusive of Platov, who was north of the Dnieper, and the various\r\nflying columns, Kutuzov probably disposed of nearly 70,000 regulars,\r\nwith about 450 well-horsed cannon.\r\n\r\nAs regards his plan of action, one does not see why Miloradovich should\r\nnot had attacked Davout directly, Golitzin was too weak to hold the\r\nGuard in check, while Tormazov’s column was too strong for its purpose.\r\nNone the less, had the over-elaborate design been vigorously executed,\r\nNapoleon’s small available force of some 28,000 men might easily have\r\nbeen destroyed.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 17th Golitzin moved upon Krasnoï, but was checked by\r\nRoguet, who momentarily captured the village of Uvarova, driving\r\nOzharovski’s detachment across the Lossmina. Golitzin therefore decided\r\nto await Miloradovich’s co-operation before pressing his advance; while\r\nKutuzov, hearing that the whole Imperial Guard, whose strength and\r\nfighting power he enormously overestimated, was at Krasnoï, kept back\r\nTormazov.\r\n\r\nDavout’s leading division (Gérard’s) reached the Lossmina between 8 and\r\n9 a.m., and came into line with Roguet; the remaining three followed.\r\nThe confusion in the rear was frightful; the trains of the 1st Corps\r\nstreamed away to the north of the road with the Russian cavalry and\r\nCossacks ranging among them. The panic-stricken drivers cut the traces\r\nand fled with the horses, and much of the remaining baggage of the\r\n1st Corps was taken, the spoil including Davout’s private carriages,\r\ncontaining, amongst other things, his Marshal’s bâton and a valuable\r\ncollection of maps. Of organised resistance there was little except\r\nfrom small bodies of brave men, who formed here and there to face the\r\ncavalry, and for the most part met their death in the performance of\r\ntheir duty. The effect of Napoleon’s diversion was that the 1st Corps\r\nsucceeded in crossing the Lossmina, but its loss was very severe, for\r\nit had to defile in square or close column to withstand the charges of\r\nthe Russian cavalry, exposed all the time to a heavy cannonade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Positions about 10 a.m. on the 17th when Davout effected\r\nhis junction with Napoleon]\r\n\r\nAs soon as Davout and Mortier had established communication, Napoleon\r\nbegan to retire upon Liadi with the Old Guard and the cavalry, except\r\nthe Dutch Grenadiers and Lancers, whom he left to support Mortier.\r\nMiloradovich and Golitzin were now in touch, and began to press\r\nvigorously. A murderous cannonade was directed upon the thin French\r\nline south of Krasnoï, and under cover of it the Russian infantry\r\nadvanced. The Dutch Grenadiers, shattered by artillery fire, fell\r\nout of the line, and the young “Flanqueurs-Chasseurs,” who were\r\nordered by Roguet to take their place, could not bear up against the\r\niron hail. To support them Roguet sent the 1st Voltigeurs and the\r\nFusilier-Grenadiers. The Flanqueurs were extricated, but the Voltigeurs\r\nwere charged by Duka’s Cuirassiers and destroyed, only forty wounded\r\nmen escaping. Nevertheless, it was already too late for the Russians\r\nto gain any decisive success. Tormazov did not receive his orders to\r\nadvance until about midday, and the tracks were so bad and narrow that\r\nhe could not reach the high-road in time to bar Napoleon’s march. Some\r\nlight cavalry were easily dislodged and the Head-quarters and Old\r\nGuard reached Liadi in safety. Mortier and Davout followed but, hotly\r\npressed by Miloradovich and Golitzin, lost heavily. The Dutch Guards\r\nwere nearly destroyed; several of the regiments of the Young Guard were\r\ncut up. Nevertheless, Mortier’s troops and three of Davout’s divisions\r\nsucceeded in getting away to Liadi, but Friederichs’ division, fiercely\r\npressed in the rear, was assailed on the west of the town by Tormazov’s\r\nvanguard, under General Rosen, and nearly destroyed. The 33rd Léger was\r\nall but exterminated, only 25 men remaining unwounded.\r\n\r\nNey had defended Smolensk until the morning of the 17th. On the 15th\r\nthe 4th Regiment gallantly repulsed an attempt of Choglokov’s Division\r\nto press the evacuation of the northern suburb. Early on the 17th\r\nthe force left for Krasnoï. Nothing was known of what was occurring\r\nahead, and Davout has been severely blamed for neglecting to inform\r\nNey. It is probable that his messengers were intercepted. Ney had,\r\nincluding Ricard’s division of the 1st Corps, perhaps nearly 9000 men,\r\nbut with hardly any cavalry, and only 18 wretchedly horsed guns. He\r\nwas also encumbered by a horde of 7000 non-combatants. Five thousand\r\nsick and wounded were left to perish in Smolensk, many being killed\r\nby the explosion of the mines which, in obedience to orders, Ney had\r\nlaid beneath the ramparts. The first day’s march was unmolested, but\r\non the 18th Ricard’s division, which was in advance, blundered in the\r\nfog against Miloradovich, who was in position behind the Lossmina.\r\nSurprised and outnumbered by six to one the division lost heavily, and\r\nwas driven back in disorder along the road to Smolensk. This, however,\r\nmight have helped Ney, for Miloradovich believed that Ricard’s force\r\nwas really the whole 3rd Corps, and was therefore taken by surprise\r\nwhen Ney, after rallying the remnants of the 2nd Division, came up\r\ntowards 3.0 p.m. The Russians, on the advice of Paskievich, formed\r\nline as they stood, a battery of 24 guns being placed across the road.\r\nNey’s force, which looked very formidable through the fog, was much\r\noverestimated, and the promptitude with which the marshal cleared away\r\nsome cavalry from a bivouac on his left impressed the Russians. He,\r\non his side, hoped that he had to deal only with a detachment, though\r\nMiloradovich sent an officer to summon him to surrender, and informed\r\nhim that he had the whole Russian army in his front. Ney detained the\r\nofficer, shots having been fired during the parley, and ordered the\r\nattack. Razout’s division went forward with splendid heroism, entered\r\nthe ravine, breasted its further bank under a furious fire, and almost\r\nreached the Russian front when it was crushed by the cannonade and\r\nmusketry and driven back in wild disorder by a counter-attack of\r\nPaskievich’s division. The Uhlans of the Guard charged the relics of\r\nthe 18th Regiment and captured its eagle. General Razout was wounded,\r\nGeneral Lanchantin captured; and only a mere remnant of the gallant\r\nforce succeeded in withdrawing under cover of Ledru’s division,\r\nwhich sacrificed itself nobly to cover the retreat. At 4.0 p.m. Ney\r\nretreated, and so impressed had Miloradovich been by the magnificent\r\naudacity of the attack that he made no effective pursuit.\r\n\r\nNey retrograded a short distance on the road to Smolensk, and then\r\nturned to the north. He resolved to cross the Dnieper on the ice and\r\nmake his way to Orsha by the right bank. He had the ice on a streamlet\r\nbroken to ascertain its direction, and followed its course until the\r\nDnieper was reached. He made a show of bivouacking at a village, but\r\nleft his fires burning, and, guided by a captured peasant, found\r\na place where the ice on the great river would bear. A thaw was,\r\nhowever, setting in, and though the fighting men mostly succeeded in\r\ncrossing, the ice broke under the first vehicles. Guns, trains, and\r\nwounded were left to their fate on the farther bank; there remained\r\nwith Ney about 3000 exhausted and starving foot-soldiers. The only\r\nfavourable circumstance was that the cold had ceased. But on the 19th\r\nPlatov was upon them with his Cossacks, and all the way to Orsha they\r\nmarched in the midst of his squadrons, repeatedly cannonaded by his\r\nsledge-artillery. The details of the daring march are vividly related\r\nby De Fezensac, but in a work such as this there is little space for\r\nthem. Ney kept the weary handful of troops together by the sheer\r\nmagnetic force of his personality. On nearing Orsha the road was found\r\nto be barred by fires, but the Marshal ordered the charge, and they\r\nwere found unguarded, having been lighted in order to terrorise him\r\ninto halting. At midnight on the 21st the force reached the Vitebsk\r\nroad about 8 miles from Orsha, where a column which Eugène had led\r\nforth to succour it was encountered. So the heroic episode ended. Of\r\nthe 3rd Corps and Ricard’s division there survived not 1500 armed men.\r\n\r\nWhile Ney was making his way to Orsha by the north bank of the Dnieper,\r\nNapoleon had arrived there on the 19th. Krasnoï, ill-planned and\r\nill-fought as it was, was Kutuzov’s last--or only--serious effort. He\r\nremained in the neighbourhood of the battle-field until the 19th, made\r\ntwo marches, halted for a day, and then made two easy marches to Kopys\r\non the Dnieper, south of Orsha. His army was certainly greatly weakened\r\nand fatigued; but he might have achieved much by a persistent and\r\nresolute advance. The result of his practical inaction was that the\r\nsmall remains of Napoleon’s fighting force were able to make their way\r\nto Orsha unmolested by the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn spite of mismanagement and timidity the fighting round Krasnoï was\r\nfearfully disastrous. The Napoleonic army had lost probably 10,000\r\nmen in action. The Russians claimed 26,170 prisoners, but at least\r\nhalf of these were the disbanded fugitives; over 100 guns were taken\r\non the field, and 112 more had been abandoned. Baggage had been taken\r\nliterally in heaps. As against this the Russians only admitted a loss\r\nof 2000 men; and it is possible that this is not a gross misstatement.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Poniatowski had met with an accident, and General\r\nZayonczek commanded the 5th Corps.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nORSHA TO THE BEREZINA\r\n\r\n\r\nNapoleon reached Orsha on November 19th, and at once set strenuously to\r\nwork to restore order. Stringent orders were given that all stragglers\r\nwere to rejoin their respective corps in specified localities. What\r\neffect these orders produced cannot easily be estimated; demoralisation\r\nwas so advanced and the mass of disbanded troops so great, that it\r\nappears that little could be done to reform the skeleton units.\r\n\r\nSomething, however, could be done to rally and refresh the scanty\r\nrelics of the fighting force. There were in the town stores sufficient\r\nto supply the troops with food for some days. There were, apparently,\r\nfifty guns, some hundreds of horses, and Eblé’s reserve train of sixty\r\npontoons with all its equipment. Six batteries were organised out of\r\nthe artillery, each of six guns. Two went to Davout, who had saved\r\nonly eight guns out of 150; two to Eugène, who had not one left; two\r\nwere assigned to Latour-Maubourg--for what reason is not very clear.\r\nMounted cavalry officers were collected into what was called the Sacred\r\nSquadron, under Grouchy. It has been stated that it was destroyed as\r\nsoon as created; but it was certainly in existence a week later.\r\n\r\nSevere orders were issued to destroy superfluous vehicles, and to hand\r\nover the horses thus freed to the artillery. Generals were restricted\r\nto a single vehicle, and soldiers were forbidden to possess carts or\r\npack-horses. These orders were largely non-effective; there were not\r\ngendarmes and faithful troops enough to execute them, and too many\r\npeople interested in resisting or neglecting them--as the passage of\r\nthe Berezina was soon to show.\r\n\r\nReasonable and necessary as it undoubtedly was to diminish the mass\r\nof baggage and assist the artillery, it was surely the height of\r\nimprudence to destroy the bridge-train. Eblé, alive to the danger,\r\npressed to be allowed to keep fifteen pontoons, but in vain, and\r\nhe could only save 2 field forges, 2 waggons of charcoal and 6 of\r\nimplements. At Smolensk he had seen to it that each man carried a tool,\r\nand a supply of clamps and large nails. To his wise precautions the\r\npiteous remnants of the _Grande Armée_ were to owe their salvation.\r\nWhen Napoleon gave the order to burn the pontoons, Chichagov had been\r\nfour days in possession of Minsk, and was already close to Borisov with\r\nhis advance-guard! Comment is needless.\r\n\r\nVictor remained at Chereia until November 10th. Oudinot, who had\r\nnow recovered from his wound, resumed the command of the 2nd Corps.\r\nThe army at Chereia was thus commanded by two independent generals\r\nwho would probably disagree. Victor was the senior officer, but not\r\ndefinitely the commander-in-chief; and Napoleon in his orders merely\r\nbids him to concert measures with Oudinot. Probably on the 9th, Victor\r\nreceived an urgent order written by Napoleon at Mikalevka, to take the\r\noffensive and drive back Wittgenstein. He was told that the safety of\r\nthe _Grande Armée_ depended upon him. The Emperor admitted that it was\r\nmuch fatigued and that the cavalry was dismounted. “March!” ordered the\r\nfalling giant. “It is the order of the Emperor and of necessity!”\r\n\r\nOn receipt of this pressing order Victor and Oudinot got under way.\r\nBut the army was no longer what it had been a fortnight previously.\r\nThe troops appear still to have been well clothed; they had availed\r\nthemselves of convoys intended for the Poles. Food does not appear\r\nto have been lacking. But the weather was bitterly cold, the ground\r\ncovered with snow, and the numbers were steadily dwindling. It\r\nis probable that the two corps did not muster over 30,000 men on\r\nNovember 14th. Wittgenstein, exclusive of Vlastov, had as many, and\r\nhis position behind the Ula and the Lukomlia was strong. His army was\r\nnow distributed in four small corps under Lieutenant-Generals Count\r\nSteingell, Prince Iachvil, Berg, and Major-General Fock.\r\n\r\nOudinot is said by De Chambray to have advocated a direct attack, but\r\nVictor considered it too risky, and it was decided to endeavour to\r\nturn the Russian left. On November 11th, therefore, the French army,\r\nthe 9th Corps leading, advanced to Lukoml, about 10 miles south of\r\nChasniki, and thence moved eastward across the Lukomlia and the Usveia\r\nupon Smoliani, a village lying beyond Wittgenstein’s left flank. On\r\nthe 13th Partouneaux’s division, which formed the advance-guard, found\r\nthat of Wittgenstein in position across the road and drove it back\r\nupon Smoliani with heavy loss, including several hundred prisoners.\r\nWittgenstein, seeing that his left was threatened, changed front in\r\nthat direction and sent forward Prince Iachvil to reinforce and rally\r\nthe advance-guard. With the rest of his army he took up a position\r\nalong the Lukomlia. His line extended for about a mile and a half,\r\ngenerally in advance of the frozen stream, its front being covered by\r\nthree large ponds, beyond which lay Smoliani. Steingell’s troops were\r\non the right and Berg’s on the left. Iachvil’s would form the centre.\r\nFock’s division was stationed in the bend of the Ula below Chasniki.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 14th Partouneaux’s division moved upon Smoliani,\r\nIachvil retiring steadily before him into the Russian main line.\r\nPartouneaux developed an attack on the village, and easily captured\r\nit, but was checked by the fire of the Russian artillery. Steingell\r\nthen sent forward some troops and retook Smoliani. Round this outpost\r\nof the Russian line a brisk conflict lasted through the rest of the\r\nshort winter’s day. Its possession was, indeed, of slight importance;\r\nand, since the Russians declined to be cowed by the threat of a turning\r\nmovement, Victor’s bolt was practically shot. Except for an attempted\r\ndemonstration by Victor’s cavalry on his right, the fighting elsewhere\r\nwas confined to a cannonade. The 2nd Corps and the bulk of the Russian\r\narmy were not engaged at all. On neither side were the losses heavy.\r\nVictor may have had about 1400 killed and wounded. The Russians claimed\r\n900 prisoners--probably a great exaggeration. Their own losses during\r\nthe two days probably totalled 2000.\r\n\r\nVictor could now only retreat. He did not know the real state of the\r\ncentral army, but he did know that his dwindling force was Napoleon’s\r\nlast reserve. On the 17th the two corps were once more about Chereia.\r\nThere they might at least hope to hold back Wittgenstein from the\r\nvitally important high-road.\r\n\r\nWrede, after Polotsk, had, as has been seen, fallen back to cover\r\nVilna. He retired through Glubokoië to Danilovichi, and was there\r\nreinforced by Coutard’s brigade, Lithuanian levies, and various\r\ndrafts, until on November 18th he had some 11,000 men. Vlastov, after\r\nthe action of Smoliani, had been drawn in by Wittgenstein, and Wrede\r\nreoccupied Glubokoië on the 19th, having previously sent Corbineau to\r\nrejoin Oudinot.\r\n\r\nAt Riga Essen had been succeeded in the command by Paulucci. The field\r\nforce of the garrison was spread out on the left bank of the Düna.\r\nIts line was very extensive, and the troops on the left, under Lewis,\r\nwere dangerously exposed. On November 15th, therefore, Macdonald made\r\nan attack upon them with Massenbach’s Prussian cavalry division, a\r\nbrigade of Prussian infantry and one of Poles. Lewis, cut off and hotly\r\npressed, only succeeded in escaping by crossing the Düna on the ice.\r\nThis sharp lesson made Paulucci cautious, and some weeks passed away in\r\ntranquillity, Macdonald growing more and more uneasy at the bad news\r\nwhich began to filter through to him, and not at all on good terms with\r\nYorck.\r\n\r\nWhile Schwarzenberg was following Sacken, Admiral Chichagov pursued\r\nhis way to Minsk. The town was full of vast magazines of every kind,\r\nbesides thousands of sick and wounded. Yet no attempt had been made\r\nto fortify it, and the force immediately available for its defence\r\nconsisted only of two small French battalions, a weak Württemberg\r\nregiment, some depôts, and 4 Lithuanian battalions and 4 squadrons\r\nnewly raised and untrustworthy. Instead of keeping his troops united\r\nnear Minsk and Borisov, Bronikowski formed a field force under General\r\nKossecki, which he sent forward on the road to Slonim. Dombrowski,\r\nhearing of Chichagov’s advance, hastened to collect his division, but\r\nit was so scattered in his effort to fulfil his multitudinous duties\r\nthat it could not arrive in time.\r\n\r\nHaving once made up his mind to ignore Schwarzenberg and push on to\r\nMinsk, the Admiral wasted no time. He sent off Colonel Chernishev with\r\na regiment of Cossacks to explain the situation to Wittgenstein, and\r\non November 9th started Lambert and Sabaniev for Minsk. In defence\r\nof his slowness hitherto it must be said that, besides the menace\r\nof Schwarzenberg in his rear, he was much pestered by orders from\r\nKutuzov, which were usually too old to be applicable to the situation.\r\nHe was directed to entrench himself on the Berezina, and he had only\r\na single competent engineer officer. He was ordered to reinforce the\r\ngarrison of Kiev, lest Napoleon should follow the example of Charles\r\nXII and move southward! To further weaken his army was madness, but\r\nChichagov diverted some drafts to Kiev, and held on for Minsk, Lambert\r\nleading, Sabaniev and Voïnov following, and Chaplitz bringing up the\r\nrear. At Nesvizh, on the 12th, General Lüders joined. On the 13th\r\nKossecki’s column was found by Lambert holding the bridge over the\r\nNiemen at Novi-Svergen. Kossecki had only 4 Lithuanian battalions\r\nand a solitary gun. He had vainly represented to Bronikowski the\r\nstrength of the advancing enemy, and begged permission to retire.\r\nLambert easily carried the bridge, capturing the gun and about 1000\r\nprisoners. Kossecki fell back towards Minsk, and on the way was\r\nreinforced by a small battalion of the French 46th, 300 French cavalry,\r\n150 Württembergers and 2 guns. On the 15th he was overtaken by Lambert\r\nat Koidanow, 18 miles from Minsk, and, after a running fight of\r\nseveral miles, his force was destroyed, only the remnant of the French\r\ncavalry, which had fought splendidly, reaching Minsk. The consequences\r\nwere fatal. Dombrowski was still over 20 miles distant with his\r\nadvance-guard; not 1500 troops remained in Minsk and Borisov; and\r\nLambert was already half-way from Koidanow. Dombrowski, who had himself\r\nhurried on in advance of his troops, saw nothing for it but to abandon\r\nMinsk. Next day Bronikowski, with about 1000 men, retreated on Borisov,\r\nwhile Dombrowski turned his troops back to Berezino, hoping thence to\r\nreach Borisov before the Russians. Minsk was occupied by Lambert in the\r\nafternoon, and there he found no less than 2,000,000 rations of food\r\nand 4700 sick and wounded. The hospitals were found to be in a shocking\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nChichagov’s whole army was in Minsk by the 18th, and a halt was made\r\nto rough-shoe the horses and rest the men. Ertel should have been at\r\nhand with his corps; but on pretext of sickness he was still at Mazyr,\r\nand only a detachment of 6 battalions, 4 squadrons and a Cossack\r\nregiment had been sent forward to Igumen. Chichagov at once despatched\r\nMajor-General Tuchkov II to supersede him.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th the Admiral started Lambert for Borisov and Chaplitz for\r\nZembin. Next day Sabaniev marched in the track of Lambert, and Voïnov\r\nafter Chaplitz. Chichagov accompanied Voïnov, while Langeron was with\r\nSabaniev. A small garrison was left in Minsk, and the Cossack Colonel\r\nLukovkin sent towards Igumen to observe Dombrowski.\r\n\r\nBronikowski had at Borisov and Vseselovo less than 2000 men. Dombrowski\r\nreached Borisov at midnight on the 20th, bringing with him 6 battalions\r\nand 6 squadrons of his division; his other infantry regiment and 2\r\nsquadrons were still behind. Arriving in the dark he bivouacked on\r\nthe left bank. A French battalion occupied the _tête du pont_, the\r\n7th Württembergers Borisov; the rest of Bronikowski’s force was at\r\nVeselovo, several miles higher up the river opposite Zembin.\r\n\r\nLambert had with him 5 infantry regiments, 28 squadrons and some\r\nCossacks--about 8000 men and 36 guns. Against him Dombrowski could\r\nbring less than 5000 in all, with, apparently, 34 guns.\r\n\r\nLambert attacked the bridge-head early on the 21st. The French\r\nbattalion was driven out, but the Württembergers hurried up from the\r\nrear, repulsed the Russians, and gave Dombrowski time to arrive. Again\r\nand again Lambert assaulted the works in vain; and the fight raged\r\nobstinately well into the afternoon, the 1st and 6th Polish regiments,\r\nwith their French and German comrades, resisting with magnificent\r\ncourage. Lambert himself was dangerously wounded. Towards evening,\r\nhowever, the 14th Chasseurs succeeded in turning the works on the right\r\nby slipping through a gully, while the bulk of Lambert’s division again\r\nassailed them in front. They were finally carried, and the adventurous\r\n14th pressed on so impetuously that they passed the bridge with the\r\nflying foe and saved it from destruction. The remains of Dombrowski’s\r\nforce were hurled through the town in utter confusion, despite their\r\ndesperate attempts to rally, and pursued by the Russian cavalry towards\r\nLochnitza, on the road to Orsha. Langeron arrived with his leading\r\ntroops towards the close of the action, and in the evening was joined\r\nby Chichagov and Voïnov.\r\n\r\nOn the Russian side more than 1500 men were killed and wounded,\r\nGeneral Engelhart being among the former and Lambert among the latter.\r\nDombrowski’s force lost over 3000 men killed, wounded, and prisoners.\r\nTwenty-four guns were taken by the victors.[8] Dombrowski’s rear-guard\r\nregiment was attacked on the march by Colonel Lukovkin, and severely\r\nmauled before it could recover from the surprise and beat off the\r\nCossacks.\r\n\r\nThe position of Napoleon now appeared desperate. Seventy thousand\r\nmen, inspirited by success, were preparing to bar his retreat to\r\nthe frontier; Minsk and Vitebsk with their magazines, Borisov with\r\nits all-important bridge, had passed into the enemy’s hands, and\r\nSchwarzenberg, with the one powerful force that remained at Napoleon’s\r\ndisposal, had been drawn far away to the south-west. The Emperor had\r\nwith him about Orsha only some 25,000 demoralised men, surrounded by a\r\nhelpless mob of 40,000 non-combatants of both sexes, the majority in\r\nthe last stages of misery and despair. He had scarcely any effective\r\ncavalry, and not more than 110 badly horsed guns, while to his left\r\nrear was a pursuing army three times his strength. So must the position\r\nof the defeated conqueror have presented itself to his dismayed\r\nfollowers. It now remains to review the circumstances which rendered\r\nit, terrible as it undoubtedly was, somewhat less critical than it\r\nmight have been.\r\n\r\nAfter Krasnoï, Kutuzov had practically abandoned the pursuit. The\r\ncondition of his army was very serious; the number of men in the ranks\r\nwas diminishing daily, while the horses were rapidly breaking down\r\nunder the effects of hard marching, little forage, and constantly\r\nremaining saddled. Buturlin states that the loss by fatigue and\r\nhardship since October 24th already amounted to 30,000 men.\r\n\r\nIn direct pursuit of Napoleon, Kutuzov sent forward the various flying\r\ncolumns and Cossack detachments, and a special force under Yermólov,\r\nconsisting of the Chasseurs of the Guard, six battalions of Dokhturov’s\r\ncorps, 2 regiments of Cossacks and 12 guns. The united force of these\r\ndetachments may be estimated at 20,000 men and 40 guns. The vanguard\r\nof Miloradovich, which was to follow in support, totalled also about\r\n20,000 men. A regiment of Chasseurs had been left to garrison Smolensk.\r\nWith the rest of the army Kutuzov marched slowly to Kopys, which he\r\nreached on the 24th, Miloradovich being about two marches farther\r\non, and Yermólov and Platov were in advance of the vanguard. Kutuzov\r\nleft the guns of 12 batteries at Kopys, using their men and horses to\r\ncomplete weakened units, and detailed to escort them the remains of\r\nthe light cavalry of the Guard. On the 26th he left Kopys with a force\r\nreduced now to about 40,000 men and 200 guns. Napoleon was already at\r\nthe Berezina, and for all practical purposes the Russian Grand Army\r\nwas off the board at the decisive moment. What was worse, though his\r\ninformation was naturally out of date, Kutuzov still endeavoured to\r\ncontrol the operations of Chichagov and Wittgenstein.\r\n\r\nChichagov on the Berezina was in a state of great uncertainty. His\r\narmy was not now more than 33,000 strong, and his 10,000 cavalry were\r\nalmost useless on the wooded and marshy banks of the river. He was\r\nwithout information of the main armies later than the evacuation of\r\nMoscow. On the evening of the 21st the Comte de Rochechouart, one of\r\nthe Admiral’s French _émigré_ staff-officers, found among Bronikowski’s\r\nhalf-burnt papers a despatch from Victor, stating that Napoleon would\r\nprobably reach Borisov on the 23rd. The news must have been something\r\nof a shock to Chichagov, since he naturally expected to be attacked by\r\ngreatly superior numbers. His conduct at this juncture has been sharply\r\ncriticised, yet one does not well see what else he could have done.\r\nHe moved forward the advance-guard, now commanded by Major-General\r\nPahlen II, towards Lochnitza, on the Orsha road, to give warning of any\r\nhostile advance, established his head-quarters in Borisov, and kept the\r\nbulk of his force on the right bank of the river. His errors appear\r\nto have been that he allowed too much of his baggage trains to cross,\r\nand permitted a large detachment of his cavalry to disperse to forage;\r\nthe latter step may, however, have been necessary. The point is that\r\nChichagov was ignorant of the deplorable condition of the Moscow army,\r\nand rather expecting to be himself attacked.\r\n\r\nWittgenstein, on his side, possessed very scanty information about the\r\ngeneral state of affairs, and his staff estimated Napoleon’s strength\r\nas at least 60,000. The result was that his movements were extremely\r\nslow and circumspect.\r\n\r\nIn other words, while the destruction of the remnant of Napoleon’s\r\nforces was inevitable if all his adversaries showed energy, it was\r\nalready becoming apparent that this would not be the case, and that he\r\nwould have an opportunity of escaping.\r\n\r\nNapoleon learned of the fall of Minsk while on the march to Orsha, and\r\ndespatched orders to Oudinot to march to Borisov to secure the passage.\r\nOn the 20th Victor was directed to cover the march on Borisov, which he\r\nwas to reach on the 26th.\r\n\r\nOudinot was timed to arrive on the 24th, and since he had only about\r\n50 miles to march, the Emperor did not imagine the position to be\r\ndesperate. Oudinot, perhaps more alive to it, reached Borisov on the\r\n23rd. On the 22nd he was rejoined by Corbineau, who, after a skirmish\r\nwith Chernishev’s Cossacks, found himself cut off from Borisov by\r\nChichagov’s army, and was guided by a peasant to a ford at Studianka,\r\nabout 8 miles higher up.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, with the Guard and head-quarters, left Orsha on the 20th and\r\narrived on the 22nd at Tolochin. There were in the place considerable\r\nstores, and Napoleon halted for 24 hours. There he was joined by Ney\r\nwith the relics of his command, Davout now resuming rear-guard duty.\r\nPlatov occupied Orsha on the afternoon of the 21st. He captured 21\r\nabandoned guns, some stores, a mass of trains, and thousands of sick\r\nand wounded, all of whom perished. The Russians had not the means of\r\nsuccouring them, even had they possessed the will to do so.\r\n\r\nJunot and Zayonczek, with the remains of the 5th and 8th Corps and\r\nthe dismounted cavalry, were in advance; then came the Guard and\r\nhead-quarters, Ney, Eugène and Davout. Davout may have had remaining\r\nabout 6000 men, Eugène perhaps 3000, Ney 1500, Junot and Zayonczek\r\npossibly each 1000; to the former were attached about 1000 dismounted\r\nhorsemen. The Guard may have been 9000 infantry and artillery and\r\n1500 cavalry strong. A few hundred only of the line cavalry still\r\nretained horses. It was with the greatest difficulty that the fighting\r\ntroops could force their way through the helpless horde of stragglers\r\nand disarmed fugitives which covered the road. The armed soldiers\r\nthemselves presented a miserable spectacle. A mournful silence reigned\r\nin the shattered ranks; the men plodded along mechanically, huddling\r\nthemselves in their rags; little was heard save the shuffling of feet\r\nin the snow and slush. Vaudoncourt records his feelings of horror when\r\nhe met the advance-guard and saw the dismounted Cuirassiers, ragged,\r\nbare-footed, emaciated, wretched beyond belief, dragging themselves\r\npainfully along the roads.\r\n\r\nAn incident typical of the absolute callousness to which misery had\r\nreduced everyone is related by Lejeune, who had succeeded Romoeuf as\r\nDavout’s chief-of-staff. At Krupki, near Borisov, Davout’s staff found\r\ntwo babies in the house occupied by them. Lejeune begged the Marshal’s\r\nsteward to try and give them a little broth. None was forthcoming,\r\nand the steward at last, distressed by the continued wailing of the\r\nlittle creatures, drowned them! Wilson, too, tells how the Grand Duke\r\nConstantine, out of sheer humanity, as he declared, “put out of his\r\nmisery” a stripped and perishing French officer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON, BERTHIER, MURAT, AND RAPP (IN THE ORDER NAMED) ROUND CAMP FIRE\r\n\r\nRussian peasants brought in prisoners by French Chasseurs-à-cheval\r\n\r\nFrom the picture by Verestchagin]\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd Napoleon heard from Oudinot that Chichagov had captured\r\nBorisov and that he himself was on the way to retake it. The Emperor\r\nreplied in a somewhat incoherent letter, instructing him to seize\r\na point of passage, and interspersing orders and intelligence with\r\nagitated appeals to the Marshal’s energy and devotion. The last were\r\nnot needed. Oudinot’s intellectual capacity was not great, but his\r\ndevotion was undoubted, and he never served Napoleon so well as in the\r\nterrible days that followed.\r\n\r\nOudinot on the 23rd picked up Dombrowski and the remains of his force.\r\nHe placed the remains of his cavalry at the head of the advance, with\r\nLegrand’s division in support; and in the afternoon fell upon Pahlen\r\nnear Lochnitza. The Russians were taken entirely by surprise, largely\r\napparently because of their leader’s negligence, and, veterans as they\r\nwere, broke and fled headlong. They poured in mad panic into Borisov\r\njust as Chichagov and his staff were dining. Everybody seems to have\r\nlost his head, and the place was abandoned in haste and complete\r\ndisorder. All the baggage which had crossed the river was left behind\r\nas the prey of the 2nd Corps--much to its benefit. Voïnov hurried up\r\n4 battalions, which occupied the houses near the bridge, and enabled\r\nthe panic-stricken mob to crowd across in safety. The bridge was then\r\nbroken, and despite their really brilliant success the passage of the\r\nriver was closed to the French. The Russians had lost in their panic\r\nflight about 1000 men in all and a quantity of baggage, including the\r\nAdmiral’s camp service and portfolio; but no guns were lost--probably\r\nrather owing to good fortune than good management. Langeron sneers\r\nbitterly at his chief, but the fault was obviously that of Pahlen and\r\nhis advance-guard, who should not have permitted themselves to be\r\nsurprised by a small force of cavalry.\r\n\r\nOn November 23rd Napoleon with his leading troops reached Bobr, a\r\ntown of 300 houses, about 35 miles from Borisov. Victor was falling\r\nback towards the road from Chereia, and on this day Billard’s brigade\r\nof Partouneaux’s division had a sharp encounter with Wittgenstein’s\r\nadvance-guard under Vlastov. Billard was driven back with considerable\r\nloss, which was, however, much exaggerated by the Russians, though a\r\nbattalion of the 126th Regiment was completely destroyed. Wittgenstein\r\nmight have done much more, but he was very circumspect and timid,\r\nand Clausewitz hints that he was not greatly disposed to co-operate\r\ncordially with Chichagov. The latter expected him to unite with his\r\nown army behind the river, according to the Tzar’s directions; and so\r\nalso did Napoleon, who ordered Victor to endeavour to bar his march\r\non Zembin. The Marshal could not obey, for he was already too far\r\nsouth, having acted upon previous instructions given when Napoleon\r\nwas still uncertain as to the point at which he should cross the\r\nBerezina. Otherwise Napoleon till the last dangerously underestimated\r\nWittgenstein’s strength, and wrote as if Victor could easily defeat him.\r\n\r\nAt Bobr Napoleon received the crushing news of the failure to save the\r\nbridge of Borisov. All now depended upon the bridging of the river.\r\nEblé, with his pontonniers and his inestimable convoy of implements,\r\nwas ordered forward, while General Chasseloup was directed also to the\r\nBerezina with all the sappers and artificers who could be collected,\r\nbut they were without forges and almost destitute of ordinary hand\r\ntools. Stringent orders were given to destroy superfluous vehicles and\r\nhand over their horses to the artillery. Needless to say, they were\r\ngenerally evaded. Davout was directed to hold firm as long as possible\r\nin order to give the miserable mob of non-combatants time to escape. It\r\nwould have been better had the humane order never been issued. Most of\r\nthe non-combatants were doomed, and the lives of devoted officers and\r\nsoldiers were wasted in protecting them. At Bobr d’Alorna rejoined with\r\nthe garrison of Mohilev. His 1500 men and the remains of the 5th Corps\r\nand Claparède’s division were united to the relics of the 3rd Corps,\r\nthus giving Ney a force of about 6000 men and 30 guns.\r\n\r\nOudinot also, on the banks of the Berezina, was doing his best. He was,\r\nas usual with Napoleon’s generals, timid of responsibility; but having\r\nmade up his mind he acted with excellent judgment. Having obtained,\r\ndespite all difficulties, information as to the points of passage, he,\r\nabout midday on the 24th, selected Studianka, and directed thither his\r\nsmall, ill-trained, and ill-equipped force of artificers. He informed\r\nNapoleon frankly of the difficulty of his task; the enemy were keenly\r\nwatching the course of the river. To distract Chichagov he made\r\ndemonstrations above and below Borisov, and noted that the Russians\r\nseemed inclined to expect the French advance rather below than above.\r\nNapoleon, after a conference with Generals Dode and Jomini, who knew\r\nthe course of the river, also decided to force a passage above Borisov,\r\nand indicated the ford at Veselovo, 15 miles above that town. When the\r\norder arrived, however, the Marshal had already selected Studianka.\r\n\r\nThe frost, which had ceased since the 18th, was now setting in again.\r\nOn the one hand, the slightly alleviated misery in the army now again\r\nbegan to increase. On the other, it hardened the low, marshy banks\r\nof the Berezina and enabled the French to transport their artillery\r\nand trains. Opposite to Studianka, about a mile from the right bank,\r\nran the Borisov-Zembin road, by which the army must defile in order\r\nto gain the Minsk-Vilna highway at Molodechno. Behind Studianka the\r\nground rose, and artillery could be placed in position to command the\r\nlow opposite bank. Studianka itself was a fair-sized village, and its\r\nhouses afforded timber useful for the construction of bridges.\r\n\r\nWe must now turn to Chichagov, who has been made by Russians the\r\nscapegoat for the escape of Napoleon. In the first place, he believed\r\nthat Napoleon had 70,000 or 80,000 men against his 32,000. Next, he\r\nhad been informed by Wittgenstein that Napoleon was, in his opinion,\r\nretreating in the direction of Bobruisk. The Admiral was confirmed\r\nin this by intelligence that Austrian cavalry scouts were on the\r\nMinsk-Bobruisk road. Chichagov’s dispositions in these circumstances\r\nwere perfectly sound. Chaplitz, who had been watching the upper\r\nBerezina for some time, remained near Brelova, nearly opposite\r\nStudianka; while Voïnov and Sabaniev, with Pahlen’s rallied force, were\r\nconcentrated round Borisov, ready to act in force in any direction.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th he received a despatch from Kutuzov. It was not a direct\r\norder, but, coming from the commander-in-chief, it naturally had great\r\nweight with the Admiral. It suggested that Napoleon would probably move\r\nsouthward towards Bobruisk to cross the lower Berezina. At the same\r\ntime, Major-General O’Rourke and Colonel Lukovkin reported that they\r\nhad found Polish troops lower down (these were Dombrowski’s belated\r\ndetachments).\r\n\r\nChichagov, assuming that Kutuzov had good reason for sending his\r\ndespatch, and considering the intelligence sent by his detachment\r\ncommanders, concluded that Napoleon’s rumoured southern movement was\r\na reality; and, on the 25th, leaving Pahlen at Borisov, and ordering\r\nChaplitz to draw in to him, he marched off with Voïnov and Sabaniev to\r\nChabachevichi, some 15 miles down the Berezina. Langeron says that both\r\nhe and Sabaniev endeavoured to dissuade him--Sabaniev apparently losing\r\nhis temper. Chichagov, however, persisted, and considering everything\r\nit is difficult to see what else he could have done, misled as he\r\nwas by bad information from every side. On the 25th Napoleon himself\r\nreached Borisov, and was seen by Langeron and his staff, much to their\r\nconsternation, as the only force at hand to oppose him was Pahlen’s\r\nweakened advance-guard. The French Guards were in Borisov; the rest\r\nof the Moscow remnant between Borisov and Krupki, two marches to the\r\nrear. Oudinot was at Studianka; Victor rather to the north of Davout\r\nat Krupki, in order to cover him against Victor. Davout since Orsha\r\nhad been only harassed by Cossacks. The bulk of Wittgenstein’s slowly\r\nadvancing force was at Kolopenichi, 27 miles north-east of Borisov:\r\nPlatov was east of Krupki, and Yermólov at Maliavka, near Bobr.\r\n\r\nGeneral Aubry, Oudinot’s chief of artillery, began to fell trees and\r\nconstruct trestles for bridges immediately upon arriving at Studianka,\r\nbut unfortunately they proved too weak. As soon as it was dark Oudinot\r\nstarted his artillery for the selected point of passage, and as night\r\ndrew its veil over the dreary banks of the Berezina, Generals Eblé\r\nand Chasseloup reached Studianka with their men and their slender\r\nequipment, and began in earnest to construct bridges. All night they\r\nlaboured to prepare the supports, and at 8 a.m. on the 26th the first\r\ntrestle was fixed in position. It had been hoped to throw three\r\nbridges, but there were scarce enough materials for two. Chasseloup\r\nsoon saw that the hopeless deficiency of equipment of his engineers\r\nwould prevent him from doing anything independently; he therefore\r\nbrought his men to help Eblé, the engineers working at the preparation\r\nof trestles and floors while the pontonniers fixed them.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the relics of the _Grande Armée_ now rested, humanly\r\nspeaking, in the hands of a prematurely aged and physically broken man\r\nof fifty-five years of age, who had never, under Napoleon, received\r\nemployment equal to his merits. The name of Jean Baptiste Eblé is one\r\nto be uttered with all honour and reverence as that of a man who,\r\nbesides being a master of his profession, was in very truth a hero,\r\nupright, modest, self-sacrificing, and literally faithful unto death.\r\nOne seeks not for purity or an exalted standard of duty among the rough\r\nand greedy fighters about Napoleon. Exceptions there were, but they\r\nwere comparatively few; and so one turns with peculiar respect towards\r\nthe simple, gracious figure of Eblé.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 26th Eblé verified the width and depth of the river. The\r\nlatter had increased, owing to a freshet, since Corbineau’s crossing\r\nfrom 3-1/2 feet to 5.\r\n\r\nBesides pushing on the preparations for the bridges, the engineers\r\nconstructed three small rafts, by which some 400 infantry were ferried\r\nover to guard the bridge-head, accompanied by some of Corbineau’s\r\ntroopers, who forded the river with foot soldiers behind them.\r\n\r\nThe cold was bitter; the water was already freezing; and the\r\npontonniers would have to work in it up to their shoulders. The ordeal\r\nmeant certain death to almost all; but the men answered the call of\r\ntheir chief with a heroism as high as his own. They were relieved every\r\n15 minutes and were promised special rewards, but five-sixths of them\r\nperished. There were 7 companies in all, about 400 men, of whom 100\r\nwere Dutch.\r\n\r\nThe bridges were placed 200 yards apart. Each had 23 sets of trestles\r\n(_chevalets_). That on the right was intended only for troops. It was\r\nterribly weak. Suitable wood for the roadway was lacking, but the\r\nengineers patched up one of planks nailed one upon another, and laid\r\nbrushwood and twigs upon it to lessen the strain. The roadway was in\r\nplaces nearly level with the water; there were no rails. The left-hand\r\nbridge was intended for artillery and baggage. It was more solid than\r\nthe other; but still very weak, and as there was no time to square them\r\nthe roadway was constructed of rough logs, the passage over which of\r\nvehicles occasioned continued joltings which impaired the stability of\r\nthe frail structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL BARON EBLÉ\r\n\r\nCommander of the Bridge Trains of the Grand Army in 1812]\r\n\r\nNapoleon himself, with his Head-quarters and Guard, reached Studianka\r\nearly on the 26th. He came to the head of the bridges and there\r\nremained until they were completed, personally supervising the\r\nconstruction. In the intervals when he could do nothing he sat on a\r\npile of logs on the bank, gloomily gazing upon the slowly progressing\r\nstructures on which his last hopes rested. More than once he asked\r\nEblé to hurry. The General pointed to his devoted pontonniers working\r\nthemselves to death in the icy stream, and the Emperor could say no\r\nmore. What he could do to relieve them he apparently did, sometimes\r\nhelping with his own hands to serve them out brandy.\r\n\r\nThe artillery of the Guard and of the 2nd Corps was massed behind\r\nStudianka ready to open fire as soon as the Russians should show\r\nthemselves. But Chaplitz was already withdrawing through the woods to\r\nBorisov; only a weak rear-guard with 2 light guns remained opposite\r\nthe village. Chaplitz’s worst fault was to neglect to destroy the long\r\nwooden bridges on which the Zembin road crossed the marshes. He was\r\na brave and a good officer, but on this occasion failed much in the\r\nperformance of his duty.\r\n\r\nAt 1 p.m. the right-hand bridge was completed, and at once Napoleon\r\ngave the order to Oudinot’s corps to cross. With the addition of\r\nDombrowski’s Poles it appears to have been nearly 11,000 strong. Some\r\nof its regiments were reduced to mere skeletons; but others were still\r\nrelatively strong. They were generally well clothed and in good order,\r\nand their still unbroken spirit appeared in the lately unaccustomed\r\ncheers with which they hailed Napoleon as they defiled past him. The\r\nSwiss regiments were especially solid and eager. Only 2 guns were\r\ntaken across for fear of injuring the bridge. The advance-guard easily\r\ncleared away Chaplitz’s feeble rear-guard, and moved forward on the\r\nBorisov road until it found Chaplitz, reinforced by Pahlen, in position\r\nacross its path. Reconnaissances despatched to Zembin found the\r\nVilna road clear, and the Emperor decided to give up any intention of\r\nreaching Minsk and to move upon Vilna.\r\n\r\nThe heavier bridge was ready at 4 p.m., and the artillery of the Guard\r\nand Oudinot’s corps began to pass. At 8 p.m. three sets of trestles\r\ngave way. Half the pontonniers were called upon and, worn out with\r\ndesperate toil and sunk in sleep as they were, they answered Eblé’s\r\ncall. By 11 p.m. the breakage was repaired, and the rest of the\r\nartillery, the remains of the reserve park, and Ney’s corps began to\r\ncross.\r\n\r\nAt 2 a.m. on the 27th the bridge broke in the centre; three sets of\r\ntrestles were destroyed. The second half of the pontonniers were called\r\nupon. Eblé himself chose good sound wood and superintended the making\r\nof new ones, while the heroic pontonniers sacrificed themselves as\r\nnobly as before. At 6 a.m. the damage was repaired and the passage\r\nproceeded. The bridge broke again at 4 p.m., two trestles giving way.\r\nIt was repaired by 6 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe supports of the troop bridge held firm, but the weak roadway was\r\ncontinually breaking, and the devoted engineers were at work upon it\r\nwith little intermission. It was so frail and swayed so badly that it\r\nis remarkable that it did not collapse.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, with the Head-quarters and the Guard (less Claparède),\r\ncrossed about 1 p.m. on the 27th. As yet no very great number of the\r\nnon-combatants had arrived, and they were mostly employees of the army\r\nwho crossed with their corps. The disbanded mob was flocking into\r\nBorisov ahead of Eugène and Davout. It was amenable to no control,\r\nand, as aforesaid, Napoleon’s order to the rear-guard to hold back was\r\nlittle likely to save it from destruction.\r\n\r\nChichagov, on reaching Chabachevichi, sent patrols across the river\r\nwhich failed to locate the enemy, and the Admiral became aware that he\r\nhad been misled. He once more turned his troops towards Borisov, which\r\nthey re-entered on the evening of the 26th. He directed Langeron to do\r\nwhat he could to reinforce Chaplitz, adding that he was coming up with\r\nall speed. Everybody, according to the bitter Langeron, was cursing\r\n“this miserable sailor.” They, however, did not know the circumstances,\r\nand might have cursed the high and well-born Prince Golénischev-Kutuzov\r\nwith better reason. Langeron took forward Pahlen’s infantry to\r\nreinforce Chaplitz; he says--certainly with exaggeration--that there\r\nwere only 1200 of them. Voïnov’s and Sabaniev’s troops, after a 30\r\nmiles march in frost and snow, were in no condition for battle, and the\r\nArmy of the Danube had to remain at rest on the 27th. Without wishing\r\nentirely to absolve Chichagov, it appears to the writer that the chief\r\nblame must be laid upon Kutuzov, who lagged behind and sent misleading\r\nintelligence. Blame also attaches to Chaplitz for his negligence\r\nat Zembin. Yet it must be observed that he probably expected, with\r\nthe rest of Chichagov’s officers, that Napoleon would retreat upon\r\nMinsk, and therefore drew in the detachment, which might otherwise\r\nhave been cut off. Chichagov cannot be blamed for resting during the\r\n27th. Borisov was full of French, who might attempt to force a passage\r\nthere. They were mostly non-combatants, but this could not of course be\r\nascertained with certainty. For the rest his troops were weary.\r\n\r\nWittgenstein was probably more blameworthy than the much abused\r\nAdmiral. His pursuit of Victor was unenergetic; despite his double\r\nsuperiority of numbers, he made no attempt to press. He was in fear\r\nthat Napoleon would turn his own right flank and retreat by Lepel to\r\nVilna; and this was in fact one of the Emperor’s alternative plans.\r\nHe moved so cautiously that on the 25th his advance-guard did not\r\ntouch the rear-guard of Victor, who fell back unmolested towards the\r\nhigh-road at Borisov. Reconnaissances made it clear that Napoleon\r\nwas not moving past the Russian right and Wittgenstein advanced to\r\nKostritza, only 8 miles from Borisov and about 10 east of Studianka.\r\nVictor reached Borisov in safety; and Eugène and Davout moved on to\r\nStudianka, where they arrived at dusk on the 27th. Victor’s move,\r\nhowever, had evil effects; his troops came upon the line of march\r\nof the unhappy fugitives from Moscow, and the awful condition of\r\nthe latter spread demoralisation in the ranks of the 9th Corps. The\r\n2nd Corps had already come in contact with the woeful relics of the\r\nGuard and Ney’s corps, and their morale was affected. At Kostritza\r\nWittgenstein learned that the French were at Studianka, but instead\r\nof marching thither he directed part of his troops on the 27th on\r\nBorisov, part on Staroï Borisov, some miles above the former place.\r\nPlatov was in touch with Wittgenstein, and Yermólov was on the march\r\nto Borisov. There were thus, of Russian troops, on the Berezina the\r\narmy of Chichagov, 32,000 strong with 180 guns, that of Wittgenstein at\r\nleast 31,000, and Yermólov’s and Platov’s columns, say 12,000 men and\r\n30 guns, in all 75,000.\r\n\r\nAs against this large and eager, if partly irregular, force Napoleon\r\nis said by De Chambray to have had barely 31,000 men. This figure is\r\ncertainly too low. De Fezensac believes that he had 50,000 men; and on\r\nthe whole it is possible that the total number of combatants was about\r\n47,000. It was composed as follows: Guard (less Claparède) 8500, Ney\r\nabout 5000, Davout 3000, Eugène 2000, Junot 1500 (including dismounted\r\ncavalry), Oudinot 11,000 (including Dombrowski), Victor 13,500,\r\nHead-quarters 2500. The last item is usually ignored by historians.\r\nThere were between 250 and 300 guns, and perhaps 5500 effective\r\ncavalry, of whom 1500 belonged to the Guard and Head-quarters. But of\r\nthese troops nearly a third were so worn down by hardship as to be\r\nhardly capable of making any great effort.\r\n\r\nEugène and Davout on reaching Studianka crossed in the night, the\r\nbitter cold of which went far to achieve the destruction of their few\r\nremaining troops. Even Oudinot’s troops, still in comparatively good\r\ncondition, suffered greatly in their wretched bivouacs in the woods\r\nof Stakhov. Behind the 1st and 4th Corps the horde of non-combatants\r\ncame pouring down to the bridges. The road from Borisov to Studianka\r\nwas choked with their throngs. Every age and sex was represented in\r\nthe helpless mass; and there was to be seen human misery in its most\r\nhideous aspects. Even more harrowing than the misery and hideous aspect\r\nof the fugitives was their utter apathy and helplessness. The crowd\r\nheaved itself sluggishly along the tracks in whatever direction it\r\nchanced to take or was pushed by moving troops. Most of the wretches\r\nwho composed it seem to have lost their senses no less than their\r\nappearance as more or less civilised human beings. The instincts\r\nof comradeship and humanity were almost extinct, and progress was\r\nconstantly retarded by the brawling and fighting for places in the\r\ncolumn of the mass of degraded savages which once had been Napoleon’s\r\n_Grande Armée_.\r\n\r\nSnow fell heavily during the night upon the unfortunates huddled\r\nshelterless among the woods and marshes. The non-combatants on\r\nreaching Studianka would go no further, despite the efforts of Eblé\r\nand Chasseloup to induce some of them to cross. Napoleon had issued\r\norders that the passage was to be kept up day and night, but they\r\nprobably could not be, at any rate were not, executed. The luckless\r\npeople continued to stream down towards Studianka until the bank for\r\nmiles was covered with them, and apathetically bivouacked as best they\r\ncould among their vehicles. Very few appear to have attempted to cross;\r\nthose who did probably created blockages and disorder, being amenable\r\nto no kind of control. The pontonniers and engineers were too few and\r\ntoo weary to enforce order in such a mass. More might have been done\r\nhad Napoleon personally exerted himself to supervise the passage;\r\nunfortunately after the 27th he did nothing.\r\n\r\nVictor’s corps on the 26th became the rear-guard, Davout and Eugène\r\npassing in advance with the scanty relics of their troops. Victor\r\nleft Borisov for Studianka on the 27th. The Baden brigade of Dändel’s\r\ndivision marched first and crossed the bridges soon after Napoleon.\r\nVictor himself with the rest of Dändel’s troops, Gérard’s Poles and\r\nSaxons, and the artillery made his way out of Borisov towards midday,\r\nwhile Partouneaux’s division with 4 guns and Delaître’s cavalry\r\nbrigade formed the rear-guard. It was to remain at Borisov until dark.\r\nPlatov was marching upon Borisov; behind him came Wittgenstein with\r\nSteingell’s and Berg’s troops. Yermólov was behind. Vlastov’s division\r\nwas marching upon Staroï Borisov and Fock’s reserve on the way to\r\nrejoin.[9]\r\n\r\nThe road from Borisov to Studianka was choked with non-combatants, sick\r\nand wounded barely capable of dragging themselves along, straggling\r\nsoldiers, disbanded skulkers, fugitives from Moscow, camp-followers,\r\nmen, women and children, huddled in a helpless mass, all streaming\r\nmechanically to Studianka with the last of the organised fighting\r\nmen. Vlastov’s division coming into the road at Staroï Borisov about\r\n3 a.m., cut the line of retreat and the rearward portions of the mob\r\nfled back towards Borisov, whence Partouneaux moved out to fight his\r\nway through. His division was now only 4000 strong. Delaître had about\r\n500 Saxon and Berg horsemen. Two tracks led from Borisov to Studianka,\r\ndividing a short distance west of the town. That to the left skirted\r\nthe bank, but it was full of stragglers, and Partouneaux, believing\r\nthat the right-hand one would take him directly to Studianka, struck\r\ninto it. This movement brought him right against Vlastov’s division.\r\nAfter a most gallant attempt to fight their way through the French were\r\nforced to give way. Partouneaux and Billard were taken prisoners with\r\nthe poor remains of the latter’s brigade, and the remaining three fell\r\nback towards Borisov, to find it occupied by Wittgenstein. They passed\r\na fearful night in the snow, without food, fire, or shelter. Next day\r\nalmost all the wounded and weaker men were dead, and the benumbed and\r\nstarving survivors could only surrender. A single battalion, about 160\r\nstrong, which had luckily taken the left-hand track, reached Studianka.\r\nThe French loss was over 4000 men, including 500 cavalry and 4 guns.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the 27th Yermólov entered Borisov. As soon as the\r\nFrench left the town Chichagov repaired the bridge with pontoons, and\r\ndirect communication being thus established, a general attack was\r\nconcerted for next day. Wittgenstein was to complete the destruction\r\nof Victor’s corps, while Chichagov, supported by Yermólov and Platov,\r\npressed Ney and Oudinot, and endeavoured to throw them back upon Zembin.\r\n\r\nThe whole country was partially wooded except on the marshy banks of\r\nthe Berezina, and in places the woods became very thick. On the western\r\nbank, about 3 miles south of Studianka and nearly half-way between the\r\nvillages of Brilova and Bolshoï Stakhov, stood Ney and Oudinot. Their\r\nfront was about a mile long, Ney’s force being on the left, resting\r\non the river, Oudinot on the right, supported upon a dense wood. Guns\r\ncould not be brought into action on either side except on the road,\r\nwhere 8 pieces, equally divided between the two armies and continually\r\nreplaced, fought each other all day. In reserve behind Ney and Oudinot\r\nstood the Guard.\r\n\r\nAt 8 a.m. Chaplitz and Pahlen began an attack on the 2nd Corps with 7\r\nregiments of Chasseurs, and soon a furious conflict raged in the woods.\r\nAt first the attack made headway, and the French and Swiss soldiers,\r\nwho had passed a wretched night, began to give ground. When the roar\r\nof firing swelled up all the disbanded men took to flight, disordering\r\nand carrying away the reserves, while Oudinot was disabled by a wound.\r\nNey, always at the point of danger, rushed to take his place, rallied\r\nthe 2nd Corps and, calling up some of his own troops in support,\r\nchecked Chaplitz’s advance and began to drive him back upon Stakhov.\r\nSome hundreds of prisoners were taken. Sabaniev, who was moving up to\r\nsupport Chaplitz, stayed Ney’s advance, but was suddenly charged in\r\nthe most gallant fashion by Doumerc’s Cuirassiers. They burst from the\r\nwoods upon Cherbatov’s division, broke through its skirmishing line,\r\nand charged its squares with desperate courage. Some 2000 Russians were\r\nsabred and captured. The Cuirassiers were of course nearly destroyed,\r\nbut their splendid behaviour saved the army for the moment. Chichagov\r\nsent forward Voïnov to sustain Sabaniev, but though nearly twice as\r\nnumerous the Russians could make no headway. The French losses were\r\nfearful. General Zayonczek, who had defended Praga against Suvorov\r\nin 1794, had his leg shattered; Legrand, Rapp, Amey, Dombrowski, and\r\nKniaziewicz were also wounded. Half the survivors of the 2nd Corps were\r\nkilled or disabled; but at night their shattered ranks still held their\r\nown, and if courage and devotion could have saved the _Grande Armée_,\r\nthat end would have been achieved.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile on the left bank Victor’s corps, with equal heroism but\r\nless success, had been contending with Wittgenstein. Most of Victor’s\r\nartillery and the Baden brigade were already across, but Napoleon now\r\nsent back the latter, adding to them apparently the Baden battalion at\r\nHead-quarters. The bridges were so blocked that the artillery could not\r\nreturn. Victor took up a position nearly perpendicular to the river,\r\njust south of Studianka, on some rising ground partially wooded. On the\r\nright, close to the river, there was a thick clump of wood. This was\r\ndefended by the Badeners. Next on the left stood the Berg brigade when\r\nit arrived in line, then Gérard’s 3 Polish regiments, with Löw’s Saxon\r\nbrigade beyond them. On the extreme left stood General Fournier with\r\nhis two remaining cavalry regiments (Baden and Hesse). Victor had under\r\nhis hand only 15 guns, and his entire strength was not more than 8000\r\ninfantry and 500 cavalry (according to his own account only 7400). The\r\nBerg brigade had moved forward to endeavour to rescue Partouneaux.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Passage of the BEREZINA\r\n\r\nPositions at Midday\r\n\r\nNov. 28, 1812.]\r\n\r\nWittgenstein left Steingell at Borisov to disarm the prisoners; the\r\nrest of his army was directed upon Studianka. Vlastov drove back the\r\nBerg troops into the main line of the 9th Corps; but was then checked,\r\nthough a battery established by Diebich made terrible havoc among the\r\nwild crowd which was surging around the entrance to the bridges. All\r\nthe non-combatants, when the balls began to fall among them, crowded\r\nto the river marge in utter confusion and there remained, huddled in\r\na mass more than 200 yards deep and extending for three-quarters of a\r\nmile. The panic was fearful, and the horrors that took place in the\r\ncrowd will never be known. Men fought their way ahead by any and every\r\nmeans, and drove their vehicles remorselessly through the press. Men,\r\nwomen, and children were murdered, trodden down, and forced helplessly\r\ninto the river, while all the while the Russian cannon-balls were\r\nfalling with the snow. Many of those who reached the bridges were\r\nthrust off them and drowned or crushed beneath the wheels of vehicles.\r\nMany committed suicide to avoid a worse fate: there is at least one\r\nwell-authenticated case of a mother who, herself mortally wounded,\r\nkilled her child before she died. Yet carriages of Napoleon’s staff\r\nand of the Generals of the Guard were laden with helpless women and\r\nchildren whom their protectors made every effort to save. Marshal\r\nBessières and General Laborde in particular earned by their humanity\r\nlaurels fairer than any which they had gained upon the field of battle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSSING THE BEREZINA\r\n\r\nThe Baden Brigade crossing the upper bridge during the night of the\r\n28-29th of November, 1812\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by J.A. Nikutowski at Carlsruhe]\r\n\r\nGeneral Berg’s first division quickly supported Vlastov. The Badeners\r\non the right were driven back; but Napoleon at once took the\r\nRussians in flank by establishing a battery on the other side of the\r\nriver. The Badeners reoccupied their position and held it all day\r\nagainst incessant assaults--at grievous cost to themselves. Further\r\nto the left Victor’s Polish troops executed a fierce counter-attack,\r\nand were on the point of piercing the Russian centre when Fock arrived\r\nwith his division and restored the conflict. Victor’s men were now\r\nhopelessly outnumbered, but they fought on with magnificent tenacity\r\nuntil nightfall. An attempt to turn the left was checked by a gallant\r\ncharge of Fournier’s troopers and repulsed by the Saxons and a Polish\r\nregiment. Berg’s second division, owing to some misunderstanding, did\r\nnot arrive until the action was over. Victor’s left was thrown back,\r\nbut he still covered the bridges.\r\n\r\nAt 9 p.m. Victor received orders to cross, and began to withdraw. All\r\nround the bridges huddled the living mass of human beings and animals,\r\nheaving sluggishly with convulsive movements to escape, but practically\r\ninert. The eastern outlets were blocked by a hideous heap of broken\r\nvehicles and dead or dying human beings and horses piled one upon\r\nanother in the trampled and blood-stained snow, through which it was\r\nimpossible to make way. Eblé and his engineers literally had to make\r\na cutting through the horrible heap and pile up the corpses on each\r\nside to keep back the unhappy mob. Through this ghastly passage, and\r\nalong others like it made for them by the pioneers, the weary remains\r\nof the German and Polish regiments defiled, but even so they often had\r\nto fight their way. It was not until 1 a.m. on the 29th that they were\r\nat last across. Victor and Eblé vainly endeavoured to persuade some\r\nof the mob to follow, but most of them were torpid with misery and\r\nhopelessness and would not move. At dawn on the 29th a small detachment\r\nof the 9th Corps which had remained to the last was withdrawn. Eblé’s\r\norders were to fire the bridges at 8 a.m., but he waited until 8.30,\r\nhoping to save some more lives. A few of the non-combatants followed\r\nVictor’s rear-guard, but the passages were soon blocked. At 8.30 Eblé\r\nfired the bridges, and there was a last scene of horror. Many of the\r\nunhappy wretches, at last alive to the situation, strove to dash\r\nthrough the flames, others endeavoured to cross on the thin ice between\r\nthe bridges, many threw themselves into the icy stream to wade or swim.\r\nIt is useless as well as painful to dwell longer upon the tragedy, the\r\ndetails of which may be gathered from countless works. Perhaps no event\r\nin history has ever so completely united in itself every element of\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\nThe loss of life at the passage of the Berezina will never be exactly\r\nknown. The _Grand Armée_ lost 1200 officers killed and wounded, which\r\nmay perhaps indicate a total of all ranks of 12,000 to 15,000. The 2nd\r\nand 9th Corps lost half their effective strength. Including prisoners\r\nand deaths from cold and misery during the three days the army was\r\nprobably diminished by from 20,000 to 25,000 men. Enormous quantities\r\nof baggage were lost, but few guns--the Russians claimed 23. The loss\r\nof life among the non-combatants must have been enormous; almost all\r\nwho were captured died of hunger or cold; their captors had little to\r\nspare them, and if the Russian regular soldiers often behaved with\r\nkindliness, the wilder Cossacks stripped their captives of everything.\r\nPerhaps the most awful incident was the fate of 500 women who were\r\nhuddled in a barn at Borisov, without food for several days, and almost\r\nwithout fires. Only some 20 survived.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that the Russian armies lost at the Berezina\r\nnot less than 10,000 killed, wounded, and prisoners. Langeron says that\r\nChichagov alone lost 7000. Of the 1500 prisoners many died of want\r\nbefore the survivors were retaken by the Russians.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that Napoleon showed to any advantage at the\r\nBerezina. The selection of the point of passage was due to the skill\r\nand energy of Oudinot; the credit for the splendid resistance on the\r\n28th is to be attributed to Ney and Victor; while the true heroes of\r\nthe episode were General Eblé and his pontonniers. Eblé died of his\r\nhardships a month later, and of his devoted 400 not 40 ever saw their\r\nhomes again.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Langeron.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Iachvil’s advance-guard was apparently distributed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF THE CAMPAIGN. LOSSES AND RESULTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe passage of the Berezina practically put an end to the existence as\r\nan organised body of the remains of the _Grande Armée_. Of the 45,000\r\nor 47,000 combatants whom Napoleon had near Studianka on the 26th,\r\nthere probably remained on the 29th little more than 25,000, a total\r\nwhich rapidly diminished through slaughter, fatigue, famine, despair\r\nand, above all, the steadily increasing cold. The 2nd and 9th Corps had\r\nsacrificed themselves heroically to cover the passage, but the double\r\nordeal of battle and hasty retreat was too heavy for them to bear,\r\nand they began to disband like the rest of the army. They had already\r\nbeen reduced to a mere handful. In a report on the evening of the 30th\r\nVictor stated that he had only 60 mounted horsemen left. He believed\r\nthat he still had 4000 infantry--the surviving half, as he explained,\r\nof the 2 divisions which had fought so gallantly on the 28th--but on\r\ncalling the roll he found that they had already dwindled to 3300.\r\n\r\nWhile the battles of the 28th were raging the corps of Davout and\r\nEugène had defiled on Zembin. The effects of the neglect of Chaplitz to\r\nbreak down the long wooden bridges over the marshes were now apparent;\r\nthe marshes were hardly as yet solid enough to bear vehicles, and had\r\nthe bridges been destroyed nothing could have passed. Before daylight\r\non the 29th Napoleon started with the Guard, followed by Victor and\r\nNey, but the passage over the long narrow bridges was so slow that at\r\n10 p.m. Ney was only at Zembin, 7 or 8 miles from Studianka. With him\r\nwere Eblé and the remnant of his pontonniers, and when the last troops\r\nhad passed they fired and blew up sections of the bridges to check the\r\npursuit of the Russians.\r\n\r\nOn November 26th Kutuzov, who was then at Staroselie, 12 miles west of\r\nKopis, seems to have awakened to the probability that Napoleon would\r\nescape. At any rate, he suddenly acted with convulsive energy, and\r\nduring the next 2 days the _Corps de Bataille_ marched 42 miles. The\r\neffort, of course, exhausted it, and on the 29th it could only cover\r\n11. In any case it was too late. Napoleon himself was already safe,\r\nand, though only followed by a remnant of his once mighty host, was\r\nable and willing to give endless trouble to Europe.\r\n\r\nMiloradovich reached Borisov on the 28th, too late to take part in\r\nthe battles. Wittgenstein was retarded by the necessity of bridging\r\nthe Berezina at Studianka, for which purpose he had to avail himself\r\nof Chichagov’s pontoons from Borisov. He directed Kutuzov II, who had\r\njust joined him, to pursue Wrede towards Vilna, and Orlov-Denisov,\r\nreinforced by some cavalry and mounted infantry, to follow Napoleon.\r\nChichagov pushed forward Chaplitz, and prepared himself to follow with\r\nthe bulk of his army.\r\n\r\nFor the relics of the _Grande Armée_ there was now, as De Chambray\r\nsays, no resource but in hasty flight. Wrede, after reoccupying\r\nGlubokoië, had moved southward to Dokchitsi, and was directed to cover\r\nthe right flank of the retreating army; but his force, at first about\r\n10,000 strong, rapidly dwindled from the ravages of cold and hardships,\r\nand the steady harassing of Kutuzov II. To expect that he could check\r\nWittgenstein, who crossed the Berezina on the 31st, and began to pursue\r\nby roads roughly parallel to the main highway, was hopeless.\r\n\r\nThe country between the Berezina and Vilna had not been completely\r\nwasted; the towns still existed; there were small garrisons and\r\nmagazines in some of them. But the increasing cold rapidly shattered\r\nevery semblance of organisation. It rapidly became so fearful that\r\nall energy was absorbed in fighting it and endeavouring to preserve\r\nexistence. The number of men actually with the colours dwindled fast.\r\nOn December 1st Ney sent the eagles of the 3rd Corps with their guards\r\nand the regimental officers to take refuge with the head-quarters and\r\nthe few thousand troops who still marched with it. When he had sent\r\nthem off there remained to escort him only a company of 100 fighting\r\nmen! The others, under General Ledru, tramped doggedly on for two days\r\nand three nights, only halting for necessary rest, and joined the\r\nhead-quarters at Molodechno.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARSHAL NEY SUPPORTING THE REAR-GUARD DURING THE RETREAT\r\nFROM MOSCOW\r\n\r\nFrom the painting by Yvon]\r\n\r\nThe flight to Vilna contains little of military interest. It was\r\na mere rout of the most pitifully helpless condition, the mass of\r\nfugitives trailing mechanically along the road, followed, surrounded,\r\nand massacred by the Cossacks, while Chichagov’s army and Yermólov’s\r\ndivision marched steadily in the rear, ready to overwhelm any solid\r\nresistance that might be made. But, in truth, little could be offered.\r\nOn November 29th Lanskoi’s cavalry detachment seized Plechenitzi on the\r\nFrench line of retreat, nearly capturing the wounded Marshal Oudinot,\r\nwhose staff heroically defended the house in which he lay. Chaplitz\r\ncrossed the Zembin marshes by strengthening the ice with planks and\r\nbrushwood, followed up the French rear-guard, and captured 7 guns\r\nand hundreds of stragglers. On the next four days there were further\r\nrear-guard actions, all much alike and all resulting in loss of guns\r\nand prisoners to the unhappy French, whose misery and demoralisation\r\nprevented them from responding to the splendid example still set them\r\nby their heroic leader. The hopeless condition of affairs may be gauged\r\nby the fact that on December 2nd there remained hardly 13,000 men\r\nwith the colours (De Chambray says only 8800). With the head-quarters\r\nthere were still perhaps 6000 or 7000; Ney had about 2500[10];\r\nVictor perhaps as many; while the 1st, 4th, and 8th Army Corps and the\r\ncavalry could not muster 1000 armed men between them. There was still a\r\nconsiderable number of armed officers, but they fell sick or broke down\r\ndaily. Disorganisation was complete. Disbanded men who had hitherto\r\nkept their weapons now threw them away. Forage could be procured; and\r\nfood in quantity sufficient to support life was not lacking. But rest\r\nwas now more necessary even than food, and it was impossible to obtain\r\nit. The bulk of the men were already broken by misery and fatigue,\r\nand were forced to continue their weary march amid a cold which grew\r\never more severe. On December 3rd it became intense; on the 5th the\r\nthermometer fell to 20° below zero (Réaumur); on the 6th to 24°; on the\r\n7th to 26°; and it is said to have fallen still lower later on. Its\r\nseverity struck even men like Löwenstern, accustomed to the winters of\r\nthe Baltic provinces.\r\n\r\nAt Vilna Napoleon might expect his last powerful\r\nreinforcement--Loison’s division of the 11th Corps, which reached\r\nthe Lithuanian capital in the last week of November with two cavalry\r\nregiments of D’Estrée’s Neapolitan division in Danzig. There were\r\nbesides in Vilna 6000 or 7000 troops of all kinds--_régiments de\r\nmarche_ and Polish and Lithuanian levies. Maret, with the best\r\nintentions but disastrous results, ordered Loison’s division forward to\r\nOchmiana to take position and cover the retreat of the relics of the\r\narmy into Vilna. It was composed of young French and German recruits,\r\nand three or four days of the cruel weather nearly destroyed it. How\r\nmany men actually died and how many disbanded cannot be ascertained; it\r\nis only certain that on December 7th there remained in the ranks less\r\nthan 3000 men!\r\n\r\nAt Molodechno on the 3rd, just as the cold was becoming deadly,\r\nNapoleon, who already contemplated leaving the army, issued practically\r\nhis last direct orders. The remains of the Polish divisions were sent\r\noff south-west towards Warsaw, which they eventually reached in safety\r\nwith such guns as they had preserved. Here Napoleon received the\r\nfirst posts which had reached him for several days, the others having\r\npresumably been intercepted by the Cossacks. Here also he composed and\r\nsent off the 29th Bulletin. It is so well known that little reference\r\nto it is necessary. It is, however, to be observed that it is as\r\ngrossly mendacious as any of the Napoleonic series; and the Emperor’s\r\ntotal lack of appreciation of the often heroic conduct of his troops\r\nthrows a very disagreeable light upon his character. Certainly no one,\r\nreading its paragraphs, would conclude that the campaign had been an\r\nannihilating catastrophe. Every post brought shoals of letters to\r\nMaret, enquiring about the food supplies at Vilna, furiously attacking\r\nthe Poles for not supporting him, and his own agents for not having\r\nurged them to do so! One most remarkable question is as to whether\r\nVilna and Kovno are fortified. Surely Napoleon should have given\r\norders on this point. The fact seems to be that at first he had been\r\nover-confident of success, and later had overlooked the necessity\r\nof protecting his bases--witness the case of Minsk. On the 29th of\r\nNovember he had ordered the minister to clear all the diplomatic body\r\naway from Vilna, lest they should be witnesses of the awful state of\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\nOn December 3rd, Victor--much against his will--relieved Ney of\r\nrear-guard duty. He was weary of the war, and desired chiefly to save\r\nthe relics of his corps. The result was a quarrel between the two\r\nmarshals. The survivors of the 9th Corps succeeded in holding off\r\nChaplitz in an engagement on the 4th, but next day Victor reported that\r\nit was completely used up, and could not receive the lightest attack.\r\nHe hurried on to Smorgoni with the few hundred frost-bitten men who\r\nremained to him.\r\n\r\nNapoleon himself reached Smorgoni at 8 a.m. on the 5th. There he called\r\nto his presence Murat, Eugène, Berthier, Davout, Ney, Lefebvre, Mortier\r\nand Bessières, and announced to them his intention of proceeding\r\nforthwith to Paris. There can be no doubt that this was his wisest\r\ncourse of action. His presence at the capital was imperatively\r\nnecessary to direct new levies, and to sustain public spirit. The army\r\npractically existed no longer, and could gain nothing by his remaining\r\nwith it; finally, any longer delay might render it impossible for him\r\nto reach his own frontier across Germany.\r\n\r\nMurat, by virtue of his rank, succeeded to a command which was merely\r\nnominal. It was no doubt wise to leave all the corps commanders with\r\nthe army, since the circumstance might impose upon the Russians; but\r\notherwise it was a measure of doubtful utility. Ney, the hardest\r\nfighter of them all, and apparently the only one who persistently held\r\nfirm to his duty, was on bad terms with Davout and Victor, and Davout\r\nand Murat quarrelled whenever they met. As it was, there being hardly\r\nanything to command, their squabbles counted for less than they might\r\notherwise have done.\r\n\r\nNapoleon left in his carriage at 7 p.m., accompanied by Caulaincourt.\r\nDuroc and Lobau followed in a sledge; and on the box of the carriage\r\nwere the Mameluke Rustan and Captain Wasowicz of the Polish Lancers of\r\nthe Guard, who acted as interpreter. Believing the road to be clear, he\r\nwas escorted only by a small detachment of Neapolitan cavalry--and thus\r\nthe mighty conqueror stole away from the scene of his ruin, leaving the\r\nsurvivors of his gigantic host to the climate and the arms of Russia.\r\n\r\nAs a fact, he had a very narrow escape from capture, since Seslavin\r\nthat day made a dash at Ochmiana. Loison’s division, however, or what\r\nremained of it, had reached the town just before; Seslavin was driven\r\nout, and bivouacked for the night a little way to the south, so that\r\nthe Emperor arrived in safety. At Medniki, the next stage, he met\r\nMaret, who had come out to meet him. The minister informed him of the\r\nenormous magazines which had gradually collected in Vilna. Presumably,\r\nas De Chambray suggests, Maret’s returns under this heading had failed\r\nto reach the Emperor, for he expressed his great relief, and directed\r\nMaret to tell Murat to halt for eight days in the city, in order to\r\nrestore the physique and morale of the army. He arrived at Vilna on the\r\n6th, leaving again, after a brief halt, for Warsaw. There, on the 10th\r\nhe had the interview with De Pradt which the latter has so graphically\r\ndescribed. He started again in a few hours _via_ Dresden for Paris,\r\nwhich he reached on the 18th.\r\n\r\nAt Vilna, indeed, there were 4,000,000 rations of biscuit and flour\r\nand 3,600,000 of meat, besides an immense quantity of grain; 27,000\r\nspare muskets, 30,000 pairs of boots, and great stores of clothing and\r\nequipment. But little of this was destined to be of use to the unhappy\r\nvictims of Napoleon’s overweening ambition. The scenes on the road\r\nbetween Vilna and the Berezina would pass all belief were there not\r\ntrustworthy witnesses, both French and Russian, to bear testimony to\r\nthem. The road and its borders were strewn with dead men and horses\r\nand abandoned guns and vehicles, often broken and half-burned, the\r\nfugitives having endeavoured to utilise them as fuel. Along this way of\r\nsorrow trailed an endless stream of human beings of both sexes, falling\r\nat every step to mingle with the corpses upon which they trampled.\r\nThose who fell were quickly stripped of their wretched rags by the\r\npassers-by--themselves doomed to the same fate before long. To dwell\r\nupon the horrors which marked every mile of the flight is useless. They\r\nmay be gathered from countless works composed by eyewitnesses. The\r\nsense of humanity had been in many cases extinguished, and there are\r\nwell-attested incidents of cannibalism. Langeron vouches for having\r\nseen bodies from which the flesh had been hacked. The intense cold\r\nproduced insanity; men took refuge in heated ovens and were roasted\r\nto death, or sprang into the fires. To be taken prisoner brought no\r\nalleviation of the lot of the hapless fugitives. The Cossacks usually\r\nstripped them; often, too, the Russians, exasperated at the destruction\r\nof Moscow and the ravages of the invaders, gave no quarter even to\r\nthose who surrendered. Besides, they could do nothing to provide\r\nfor them even had they the will. Prisoners died, as before, by the\r\nroadside, stripped, famished, frozen; at Vilna they were packed into\r\nbuildings where pestilence raged amid cold, filth, and lack of proper\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nOn towards Vilna, to which they looked forward as a haven of rest, the\r\nwretched horde streamed. The Cossacks hung about the route, dashed\r\nat will into the huddled mass, mixed with the crowd, and killed and\r\nplundered with deadly dexterity. Around the head-quarters still moved\r\na considerable but steadily diminishing body of fighting men, but\r\ndiscipline had vanished, and even the Guard marched in confusion, and\r\npaid little heed to orders. Here and there among the piteous crowd that\r\nfollowed were to be found groups of armed officers and men, often sick\r\nand worn out, but retaining spirit to sell their lives dearly when\r\nattacked, but these were few. Even the rear-guard was not an organised\r\nbody--merely a band of desperate warriors held together, usually, by\r\nthe personal influence of the one Marshal of France who returned from\r\nRussia with added renown.\r\n\r\nOn the heels of the French rear-guard marched Chaplitz’s division,\r\nattacking at every opportunity, picking up abandoned guns and vehicles\r\nmile by mile and disarming prisoners, who were then left to live or\r\ndie as they might. After Chaplitz, always between a piteous double\r\nstream of “prisoners” whom it could neither care for nor guard, tramped\r\nthe Army of the Danube, everyone from the Admiral downwards marching\r\non foot to escape frost-bite, and carefully taking every precaution\r\nagainst it. Sometimes the road was so choked with dead that the\r\ndismounted cavalry in the advance had to clear it before the guns and\r\ntrains could be got forward. Langeron says that, despite the weather,\r\nfatal cases of frost-bite were almost unknown among these veterans of\r\nthe Turkish War.\r\n\r\nIt is distressing, amid the stories of the universal misery and\r\ndestitution, to read of the waggon-loads of luxuries belonging to\r\nNapoleon, Murat and other generals which were taken by the Russians.\r\nThere is a grim humour in learning that the uncouth captors often took\r\nperfumes for spirits and liqueurs, and ate pomade in mistake for butter!\r\n\r\nVictor on reaching Ochmiana found, instead of Loison’s strong division,\r\n3000 or 4000 half-frozen recruits who would waste away entirely in a\r\ncouple of days. He continued his retreat in all haste, followed and\r\nharassed by Chaplitz and Platov, who picked up prisoners by thousands\r\nand cannon by scores. On the 9th, a little way short of Vilna, Wrede\r\narrived. His force had dwindled from cold, dispersion, and losses in\r\nskirmishing to a remnant of less than 3000 men, but he still possessed\r\nseveral guns. Murat and the head-quarters had reached Vilna on the 8th;\r\nbut as early as the 6th bands of ragged and destitute fugitives had\r\nbegun to enter the city to the consternation of the inhabitants. Even\r\nin Murat’s column there was panic and disorder, which was only checked\r\nfor a while by the Chasseurs of the Old Guard, who held together\r\nin the mob and prevented a mad rush. But when they had entered the\r\ncrush became terrible, and order impossible. The gates were choked\r\nand, amongst others, Davout and his staff could only enter by a gap\r\nin a wall. The fugitives poured through the streets seeking for food\r\nand shelter--often vainly, for the horrified inhabitants barricaded\r\nthemselves in their houses--and when they could not obtain it, dropped\r\ndown to die. The Jewish tradesmen sold food to the helpless wretches\r\nliterally for its weight in gold; but when the city was evacuated,\r\nunless all accounts lie, they murdered and robbed them wholesale.\r\n\r\nTo stay in Vilna, even for a few days, was impossible. Seslavin and\r\nhis Cossacks actually entered the city on the 9th, but were, of\r\ncourse, obliged to retreat almost immediately. But the action showed\r\nthe absolute recklessness of the Russians, and the French army was\r\ndestitute of power to resist. So many of the men dispersed in the city\r\nthat on the 10th only 6000 or 7000 at most were under arms. A large\r\npart of the fugitives never left Vilna again. Many were worn out by\r\nsickness and fatigue, and having once lain down to rest had not power\r\nto rise. Many died through drinking spirits, in the hope of resisting\r\nthe cold. Many more were frost-bitten, and sudden warmth added to\r\nneglect produced gangrene. Nearly 20,000 helpless creatures were left,\r\nmostly to perish, in the city when the remainder pursued their way to\r\nthe Niemen. No news as to the actual state of affairs had been allowed\r\nto reach Vilna, and the consequence was that no preparations had been\r\nmade for the reception of the army. Murat simply lost his head; at the\r\nfirst sound of the cannon at the advance posts he left the palace in\r\nwhich he had established himself and hurried to the Kovno gate to be\r\nready to escape. Berthier issued hasty orders to destroy the arms and\r\nammunition in the arsenal. Eblé, whose noble life was almost spent,\r\nand who had set the crown upon his reputation by his unfailing heroism\r\nand self-sacrifice during the last stages of the retreat, was charged\r\nwith this melancholy duty, Lariboissière being even nearer his end.\r\nDirections were given to issue food and clothes to everybody abundantly\r\nand without attention to forms. Orders were sent to Schwarzenberg to\r\nwithdraw to Bielostok, while Macdonald was instructed to retreat to\r\nTilsit. The hopeless task of holding back the Russians was thrown upon\r\nthe shoulders of Ney.\r\n\r\nWrede with his frozen and disorganised remnant was driven in upon Vilna\r\nby Platov on the 9th. The Cossacks were already all round the town\r\nskirmishing with the defenders. Apart from the destruction wrought\r\nby the cold the latter suffered considerable loss. The Lithuanian\r\nTartar Squadrons, destined to form part of the Guard, were completely\r\nannihilated. In the night Murat evacuated Vilna, and next day Ney\r\nabandoned it, the Cossacks following him through the streets.\r\n\r\nA few miles from Vilna the road to Kovno leads over a steep hill.\r\nThe remains of the army trains and those from Vilna, which were\r\nfollowing the army, found themselves blocked at the foot of the\r\nicebound slope, up which the horses were utterly unable to drag them.\r\nThe last remaining guns and most of the waggons had to be abandoned.\r\nThe army pay-chests, containing 10,000,000 francs, were abandoned and\r\npartly pillaged by the soldiers. Only Napoleon’s private treasure and\r\ncarriages, and a very small proportion of the trains, were by desperate\r\nexertions preserved, 20 horses being necessary to drag a single vehicle\r\nup the hill. In the midst of the disorder and pillage the Cossacks\r\narrived. Platov opened on the crowd with his light guns, but his wild\r\nhorsemen for the most part fell upon the spoil and apparently disdained\r\nto take prisoners. The disaster was due to sheer lack of management,\r\nsince the Novi Troki road, which was level and little longer, turned\r\nthe hill to the south, and might easily have been used for the retreat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NAPOLEON’S TRAVELLING KITCHEN\r\n\r\nIt was taken to Moscow and afterwards captured on the field of Waterloo\r\n\r\nPhotographed for this work at the Royal Artillery Museum, Woolwich]\r\n\r\nIt was as hopeless to attempt to hold firm at Kovno as at Vilna. There\r\nwere 42 guns in the town, partly those of Loison’s division, which\r\nhad been left there, great magazines of food and clothing, and about\r\n2,500,000 francs in cash. There was a feeble _tête du pont_, but the\r\nNiemen was frozen and could be crossed anywhere on the ice. On the\r\n12th the main body poured into the town--about 20,000 men, mostly\r\nin the last stage of misery and despair and nearly all disarmed. The\r\nGuard mustered 1600 bayonets and sabres. Ney, who had been fighting\r\nwith Platov all the way from Vilna, reached the town in the evening;\r\nwith the garrison troops added to the relics of the rear-guard he had\r\nnot 2000 men. Efforts were made to distribute the stores and re-arm the\r\ndisbanded troops, but the men threw away the muskets. The magazines\r\nwere pillaged, the miserable wretches naturally fastening upon the\r\nspirit stores. Men drunken and dying lay in heaps in the snow-covered\r\nstreets. Most of the benumbed fugitives lacked even the sense to avail\r\nthemselves of the ice on the river; they crowded mechanically over the\r\nbridge, fighting for precedence, stifling and trampling each other\r\ndown, as at the Berezina and Vilna. Murat placed some guns in battery\r\non the left bank of the Niemen, and left for Königsberg on the 13th,\r\nwhile Ney and the rear-guard occupied the town, which they held until\r\ndark. Platov sent across a detachment on the ice, which captured the\r\nguns on the left bank and barred Ney’s retreat. His men were largely\r\nhuddling in the houses; he had only a few hundred armed soldiers. He\r\nturned down the left bank of the river and then diverged to the left\r\nacross the Pelwiski forest, eventually making his way by Gumbinnen to\r\nKönigsberg. He abandoned in the forest Loison’s 16 guns, almost the\r\nlast artillery that the army retained.\r\n\r\nThe Russians did not immediately cross the political frontier, and\r\nbitterly as the Prussian peasantry hated the French they did not\r\nactively ill-treat them. Many isolated fugitives were disarmed, but\r\ntheir misery was such as to melt even hearts steeled by hatred and\r\nthe memory of recent oppression. De Fezensac says that the happiness\r\nof being fed and lodged prevented them from noticing the hostility of\r\nthe people. The bulk of the mob of fugitives reached Königsberg by the\r\n20th, and thence cantonments were spread along the Vistula. On that\r\nday the infantry of the Guard counted about 2500 officers and men, of\r\nwhom 1000 were sick. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Corps mustered between\r\nthem on January 10th, 1813, some 13,000 men sound and sick, of whom\r\n2500 were officers. As to the condition of the army, nearly all the\r\ntroops were disarmed and had to be furnished with new muskets from the\r\nvast magazines at Danzig. On December 23rd Eblé, now in chief command\r\nof the artillery, reported that of all the vast train which had entered\r\nRussia with the Central Army there remained but 9 guns and howitzers,\r\nand 5 caissons!\r\n\r\nTwo days before Lariboissière had died, and on December 30th Eblé\r\nalso passed away. Colonel Pion des Loches, a man who rarely has a\r\ngood word to say for his superiors, expresses himself thus concerning\r\nthem: “Both were victims of their zeal and devotion. Our army lost in\r\nthem its pillars and supports ... and what are all our other generals\r\nworth beside them?” As his comrades in arms laid Eblé to rest in the\r\nRoman Catholic cemetery at Königsberg, Napoleon was signing the decree\r\nwhich created him First Inspector-General of Artillery. Eblé’s grave\r\nhas vanished, for the cemetery has been destroyed, but his glory far\r\noutshines that of thousands of better known men.\r\n\r\nMarshal Kutuzov reached Vilna on December 12th to control the hitherto\r\nindependent movements of Chichagov and Wittgenstein. His own troops\r\nwere following under Tormazov, but they were so shattered by the long\r\nmarch from Moscow that their offensive power was for the time at an\r\nend, and they were cantoned about Vilna. Chichagov was to follow to\r\nthe Niemen to support Platov and the advance-guards which hung on the\r\nheels of the retreating French. Wittgenstein was ordered to intercept\r\nMacdonald on his expected retreat to the Niemen, while Paulucci was to\r\npress him in rear. Sacken’s army, supported by the Mozyr force, now\r\nunder Tuchkov II, and a detachment from Bobruisk, was to deal with\r\nSchwarzenberg. The Emperor Alexander reached Vilna on December 22nd,\r\nand at once devoted himself to the task of endeavouring to save the\r\nlives of his captured enemies. The hospitals were choked with the\r\nRussian sick, and the French prisoners, almost all ill and helpless,\r\nwere perishing wholesale. Biscuit and bread they received, but there\r\nwas no other help for them. Gangrened wounds, frost-bite, and typhus\r\nproduced by filth, hunger, and putrefaction, swept them away. In\r\nthree weeks 15,000 are said to have died. Alexander and Constantine\r\nmade magnificent efforts to cope with the awful mass of human misery.\r\nReckless of personal danger, they personally superintended the relief\r\noperations; the Grand Duke nearly died of the fever which he caught in\r\nthe midst of his labour of humanity. St. Priest was transferred from\r\nthe work of collecting the Russian stragglers to that of superintending\r\nthe hospitals of the prisoners, for which his French origin especially\r\nfitted him.\r\n\r\nMacdonald, before Riga, received his orders to retreat on December\r\n18th, and started next day in two main columns, he himself leading\r\nthe way with Grandjean’s division, a Prussian infantry brigade, and\r\nMassenbach’s cavalry; while Yorck followed a day’s march behind the\r\nrest of the Prussians. Wittgenstein himself could hardly intercept\r\nhim; but the flying detachments of Kutuzov II and Diebich, thrown\r\nfar forward, might hope to impede Macdonald’s march. The Marshal on\r\nreaching Koltiniani divided his own column, taking advantage of two\r\nroads thence to Tilsit, and intending to reunite his whole corps at\r\nTauroggen. Kutuzov II was too weak to intercept him; but Diebich, with\r\nhis 1500 cavalry and a few sledge-guns, got between Macdonald and Yorck\r\non the 25th, and boldly proposed to the latter a conference in order to\r\nprevent useless bloodshed. After some hesitation Yorck at last made up\r\nhis mind, and on the 30th concluded the famous convention of Tauroggen,\r\nby which the Prussians were declared neutral. The results were\r\nincalculably important, but belong rather to the history of the German\r\nWar of Liberation. The immediate consequence was that the wreck of the\r\n_Grande Armée_ was weakened by 16,000 or 17,000 excellent soldiers and\r\n60 guns.\r\n\r\nMacdonald, meanwhile, was pursuing his retreat, and on the 27th\r\nrepulsed Vlastov’s divisions, which had come up to support Kutuzov II,\r\ncapturing some prisoners and a gun. But at Tilsit, on the 31st, he\r\nwas deserted by Massenbach and was forced to fall back on Königsberg.\r\nHe marched rapidly and steadily, and reached the Prussian capital in\r\nsafety. On January 3rd, 1813, his rear-guard, under Bachelu, was driven\r\nthrough Labiau, after a hard fight, by Wittgenstein’s advance-guard\r\nunder Chepelev. At Königsberg Macdonald was joined by Heudelet’s\r\ndivision, but Yorck’s defection ended all hope of being able to make\r\na stand on the Pregel, and the retreat was continued to Danzig. When\r\nthe blockade of Riga was raised, Paulucci sent Lewis with 8000 men to\r\npursue Macdonald, and himself with 3000 made a dash for Memel, which\r\nhe reached on December 15th, after an amazing march of 200 miles in 8\r\ndays. The place immediately surrendered.\r\n\r\nWhile Schwarzenberg had been contending with Sacken, General Kosinski\r\nwith his Poles had once more invaded Volhynia, but was repulsed after a\r\nlittle skirmishing by Musin-Pushkin.\r\n\r\nSchwarzenberg, turning from his pursuit of Sacken, reached Slonim again\r\non December 7th; but on learning of the catastrophe of the _Grande\r\nArmée_ he retreated on the 14th to Bielostok, arriving there on the\r\n18th. Reynier drew back behind the Bug. On the advance of Sacken\r\nand Tuchkov, to assist whom Kutuzov also directed a column under\r\nMiloradovich, Schwarzenberg steadily withdrew, there being nothing but\r\nthe most insignificant fighting. The Austrians eventually fell back\r\ninto their own territory, while Reynier retreated towards Saxony.\r\nThe Polish troops remained in the Vistula fortresses, and were mostly\r\ncaptured in the following year. The little field army which Poniatowski\r\nwas able to collect was allowed to join Napoleon in Saxony, since its\r\nblockade employed too many troops.\r\n\r\nThus in the last days of December the Russian territory had been freed\r\nfrom the vast host which had threatened to overwhelm it. The immediate\r\nresult of the campaign was the all but complete destruction of an army\r\nnearly 700,000 men strong and its immense material. In all it would\r\nappear that, exclusive of Polish stationary troops and local levies\r\nother than those already mentioned, some 674,000 combatants crossed\r\nthe Vistula against Russia, of whom about 640,000 actually took part\r\nin military operations. Of these 640,000 there remained as organised\r\ntroops at the end of the campaign only the forces of Schwarzenberg and\r\nMacdonald, perhaps 68,000 combatants in all. All the other corps and\r\ndivisions were represented by about 25,000 disorganised and generally\r\ndisarmed men--largely officers--without cavalry and with scarcely\r\nany artillery. The number of guns which actually entered Russia is\r\nsomewhat doubtful, but appears to have been over 1300, exclusive of\r\nthe Riga siege train. Of these some 250 can be accounted for as having\r\nreturned. The Russians claimed 929 as captured; the rest were no doubt\r\nabandoned and never recovered. More than 200,000 trained horses were\r\nlost; and it was the want of them which, even more than the deficiency\r\nof trained men, ruined Napoleon’s chances in 1813. The total chasm\r\nin the Napoleonic ranks was over 550,000 fighting men. As prisoners\r\nthe Russians claimed 48 generals, 3000 officers, and 190,000 men, but\r\nit is to be feared that half of them were captured only to die. Even\r\nwithout making allowance for this, more than 350,000 soldiers must have\r\nperished, besides the tens of thousands of camp-followers, refugees,\r\nand other non-combatants.\r\n\r\nThe Russian losses are extremely difficult to compute. It is impossible\r\nto work upon the number of men successfully put into the field,\r\nand those remaining active at the close of the campaign, since the\r\ndeficiency does not, as in the case of the Napoleonic army, represent\r\nabsolute loss. There are reasons for believing that the actual loss of\r\nfighting men was nearly 150,000. The number of non-combatants--largely\r\npeaceful inhabitants of the country--who perished must have been\r\nenormous.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate results of the Russian victory were the general uprising\r\nof northern Germany against Napoleon, the adhesion of Austria--after\r\nconsiderable hesitation--to the anti-Napoleonic coalition, and the\r\ncomplete overthrow within little more than a year of the empire of\r\nforce which he had built in Europe. Britain had long since destroyed\r\nNapoleon’s efforts at gaining power on the sea, and had struck heavy\r\nblows at his prestige on land. As the Russian army lay at Tarutino it\r\nwas gladdened by the news of Wellington’s victories. And the prestige\r\nof Napoleon, shaken in Spain, was now shattered in Russia, and his\r\nmaterial military power so broken that he was never really able again\r\nto face his antagonists on equal terms. It is perhaps true to say that\r\nthe enthusiastic uprising of Germany was the chief factor in Napoleon’s\r\ndownfall in 1813, but it was Russia who gave the impulse and cleared\r\nthe way; and her military aid was of vital importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIRST BATTLE OF POLOTSK (August 17th and 18th, 1812)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\nFORCES SUCCESSIVELY EMPLOYED BY NAPOLEON AGAINST
